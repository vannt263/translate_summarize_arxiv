    "this paper provides some pieces of a big picture .",

    "@xcite we study a different notion of  scaling exponent \" dealing with behavior near the  spanning constants \" , i.e. near the mst and tsp constants @xmath83 .",
    "these exponents are based on comparing near - optimal solutions to the optimal solution , and turn out to take the values @xmath11 and @xmath84 .",
    "these values hold in the @xmath24 model by the methodology used here , and there is evidence ( from monte carlo simulations ) they hold for random points in real @xmath85 dimensional space . that the  percolative \" scaling exponents in this paper coincide with the  spanning \" exponents of @xcite is remarkable , and reinforces the idea put forward in @xcite that these scaling exponents provide a natural way of defining",
    " universality classes \" of optimization problems on random points .",
    "a natural next project is to study via monte carlo these percolative scaling exponents for random points in @xmath85 dimensions , although this seems algorithmically difficult . at the time of writing ,",
    "the only one of the four exponents we understand non - computationally is the tree / spanning exponent  2 \" , which is easily explained @xcite using the greedy algorithm for finding the mst .",
    "see section [ sec - scope ] for further remarks .      here is our methodology , in brief .    *",
    "the stochastic mean field model for @xmath0 points has a @xmath2 limit , the pwit ( section [ sec - pwit ] ) . *",
    "introducing lagrange multipliers turns the constrained maximization problem into an unconstrained maximization problem .",
    "one can formulate the corresponding maximization problem for the pwit , and define random variables @xmath86 measuring the relative effect on the maximized value of including or excluding a reference edge in the solution . *",
    "the recursive structure of the pwit enables one to write down equations ( [ x - rec],[z - rec ] ) satisfied by @xmath86 , which can be numerically solved .",
    "the limit optimal values of length and @xmath87 are determined from the definitions of @xmath86 .",
    "the arguments are not mathematically rigorous , for two main reasons .",
    "first , the central idea of identifying limits of solutions of finite-@xmath0 optimization problems with solutions of infinite-@xmath0 optimization problems requires justification , which has been given only in the case ( related to but slightly different from those considered here ) of mean - field _ minimal matching _ @xcite and the less closely related case of some random graph problems @xcite .",
    "second , the scaling exponents are found by numerically solving equations with a parameter and examining numerical behavior as the parameter goes to a limit , and this falls short of analyzing the parameter - limit behavior rigorously .",
    "for fixed @xmath0 , the @xmath24 model is defined as follows .",
    "there are @xmath0 points . for each of the @xmath88 pairs of points",
    ", there is a  link \" whose length is random with exponential ( mean @xmath0 ) distributions , these random lengths being independent .",
    "the distance between two points is then the length of the shortest path of links between them .",
    "the assumption of _ exponential _ distribution is convenient but not essential ; results are unchanged if the link lengths are @xmath89 where @xmath90 has a density with @xmath91 .",
    "the scaling of link lengths is set up so that , as @xmath2 , the mean distance from a typical point to its nearest neighbor converges to @xmath12 .",
    "but much more is true , as we now outline briefly ( see @xcite for detailed survey ) .",
    "there is an infinite - point model , the _ pwit _ , defined as follows .",
    "there is a root @xmath92 .",
    "the root has an infinite number of links to points labeled @xmath93 , and these link lengths @xmath94 are the successive points of a poisson process of rate @xmath12 on @xmath95 .",
    "recursively , each point @xmath96 has an infinite number of further links to points @xmath97 whose lengths @xmath98 are independent copies of the poisson process . the pwit is illustrated in figure 3 , and the web site @xcite enables one to explore its structure via genuine simulations .",
    "the pwit is the @xmath2 limit of @xmath24 in a precise sense called _ local weak convergence _",
    "choose a random point of @xmath24 to be a root .",
    "then as @xmath2 , for any fixed  window size \" @xmath99 the configuration of points in @xmath24 within a window of radius @xmath99 centered at the root converges in distribution to the configuration of points in the pwit within a window of radius @xmath99 centered at the root .",
    "two properties of the pwit enter into our calculations later .    *",
    "* for each  child \" @xmath96 linked to the root , there is a subtree @xmath100 consisting of @xmath96 and its descendants .",
    "the _ recursive structure of the pwit _",
    ", built into the definition , says that the subtrees @xmath100 are independent as @xmath96 varies and are distributed as the pwit itself .    *",
    "* the fact that we choose a ( uniform ) _ random _ vertex of @xmath24 to be the root leads to a _ stationarity _ property of the pwit .",
    "roughly , this says that the root is a  typical \" vertex of the pwit and therefore , by the ergodic principle , we can compute averages over all vertices of the pwit by computing expectations at the root . as a more explicit instance , given a random vertex subset @xmath101 of @xmath24 , suppose we have joint local weak convergence of @xmath102 to @xmath103 for a random vertex subset @xmath104 of the pwit .",
