    "the main goal of the experimental heavy ion collision program at rhic and lhc is to verify the existence of a nearly thermal quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , as well as to determine its properties .",
    "currently , the several collaborations participating in these experiments are able to provide a wealth of experimental data on the transverse momentum of hadrons , leptons and photons produced in the collisions . however , interpreting such findings and extracting the properties of the qgp from them is a complicated task , requiring a good theoretical understanding of the dynamics of the system produced in the reaction .",
    "relativistic fluid dynamics is currently the main theoretical tool used to describe the spacetime evolution of the bulk matter formed in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "such approach has been particularly successful in predicting and understanding the azimuthal asymmetries of the transverse momentum spectra of charged hadrons  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "such azimuthal asymmetries emerge from a fluid - dynamical response to the azimuthally inhomogeneous initial geometry of the matter produced .",
    "currently , there are several studies indicating that the effective shear viscosity to entropy density ratio @xmath2 required to describe the data must be small , of the order of @xmath3 @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "such collisions occur under extreme conditions that may even question the validity of a fluid - dynamical description .",
    "the system is created in a very small volume and lives for a very short time , rendering the applicability of fluid dynamics questionable .",
    "recently , the situation was made more extreme by the inclusion of event by event fluctuations in the initial state of the system  @xcite , which serve to increase the size of its energy density and flow velocity gradients .",
    "while in previous fluid - dynamical models such gradients were of the order of the system size ( @xmath4 fm ) , now the fluctuations are thought to be sub - fermionic @xcite .",
    "if fluid dynamics is in fact able to describe the time evolution of energy density fluctuations on such small distance scales , it may be even applicable to model the dynamics of proton - nucleus collisions @xcite .",
    "for this reason , it is important to study the domain of validity of fluid dynamics in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions . the applicability of fluid dynamics is traditionally quantified in terms of the knudsen number , a ratio between the microscopic and macroscopic length scales involved in the problem .",
    "a small knudsen number implies a wide separation between the microscopic and macroscopic distance / time scales making it possible for the system to approach local thermodynamic equilibrium in macroscopic volumes .",
    "a large knudsen number usually results in a strong deviation from local thermodynamic equilibrium , rendering the applicability of fluid dynamics doubtful .",
    "so far , a detailed study of the values of knudsen numbers that may be reached in the realistic fluid - dynamical modeling of heavy ion collisions has not been performed .    in this work",
    ", we estimate the magnitude of the ( local ) knudsen numbers that can be reached in the fluid - evolution of the quark - gluon plasma formed in heavy ion ( aa ) collisions , and in proton - nucleus ( pa ) collisions .",
    "we consider several choices of gradients to quantify the macroscopic length / time scales : 1 ) the expansion rate , 2 ) energy density gradient , 3 ) the shear tensor , 4 ) the vorticity tensor , and 5 ) the proper time derivative of the flow velocity .",
    "we then investigate the applicability of fluid dynamics in aa and pa collisions at rhic and lhc energies . here , we do not consider fluctuations in the initial energy density profiles .",
    "rather , we study how the applicability of fluid dynamics depends on the scale of density and velocity fluctuations by varying the system size .",
    "this is done so by considering several centrality classes , for the case of aa collisions , and several multiplicities for pa collisions .",
    "we then study the magnitude of the viscosity that the fluid - dynamical modeling can handle before it breaks down .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : fluid ] we shortly introduce the theory of transient fluid dynamics , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : knudsen ] we discuss the conditions for which this theory is applicable .",
    "the details of the fluid dynamical modeling of aa and pa collisions are specified in sec .",

    "[ sec : results ] we show the main results of this paper . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we discuss the implications of our results and make our concluding remarks .",
    "we use natural units @xmath5 , and the sign convention of the metric tensor is @xmath6 .",
    "fluid dynamics is an effective theory that describes the long distance , long time limit of an underlying microscopic theory @xcite . in this case",
    "the state of the fluid can be characterized solely by the densities and currents associated to conserved quantities , such as the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath7 , and net charge 4-currents , @xmath8 ( e.g.  the baryon number 4-current in heavy ion collisions . ) the dynamical evolution of @xmath9 and @xmath8 is given by the continuity equations , @xmath10 which are completely general and follow solely from the fact that energy , momentum , and charge are conserved on a microscopic level .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor and charge 4-current can be tensor decomposed in terms of the fluid 4-velocity , @xmath11 , @xmath12where @xmath13 is the energy density , @xmath14 the thermodynamic pressure , @xmath15 the net - charge density , @xmath16 the bulk viscous pressure , @xmath17 the net - charge diffusion 4-current , and @xmath18 the shear - stress tensor . for the sake of convenience , we further introduced the projection operator onto the 3-space orthogonal to the velocity , @xmath19 .",
    "it is also convenient to define a double projection operator , that is symmetric and traceless , @xmath20 .",
    "since the conservation laws lead to only 5 equations of motion and conserved currents , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , contain 14 degrees of freedom , the system of equations is not yet closed and one still needs to provide 9 additional equations of motion .",
    "these would correspond to the time evolution equations for the dissipative currents , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath21 .    in heavy ion collisions , one must model the evolution of the matter using a relativistic formulation of fluid - dynamics .",
    "traditional formulations , such as navier - stokes theory or the gradient expansion @xcite , do not work since their acausal nature @xcite leads to intrinsic instabilities that render the theory useless for practical purposes @xcite .",
    "this problem is usually solved by employing causal formulations of fluid dynamics , in which the dissipative currents become independent dynamical variables that satisfy relaxation - type equations @xcite .",
    "there are several formulations of causal fluid dynamics . in this work ,",
    "we employ the equations derived from kinetic theory in refs .",
    "such equations include all the possible nonlinear terms that can appear in the time evolution equations for the dissipative currents and in principle increase the domain of applicability .",
    "for the purposes of this work , we shall neglect the effects of bulk viscous pressure and net baryon number diffusion , i.e. , @xmath22 .",
    "thus , all dissipative effects originate only from the dynamics of the shear - stress tensor .",
    "the equation of motion for the shear - stress tensor derived from kinetic theory is @xcite @xmath23 above we introduced the shear viscosity , @xmath24 , shear relaxation time , @xmath25 , and the remaining transport coefficients of the nonlinear terms @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . the notation for the transport coefficients was taken from ref .",
    "we further introduced the shear tensor , @xmath29 @xmath30 , the expansion rate , @xmath31 , and the vorticity tensor , @xmath32 , and used the notation , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .    in the 14-moment approximation and massless limit , it is possible to show that @xcite @xmath36 in this work , we assume that the above expressions remain valid even for a strongly interacting system , and use them in our simulations . in heavy ion collisions , it is common to assume an effective shear viscosity that is proportional to the entropy density , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the entropy density and @xmath39 is a proportionality coefficient .",
    "the coefficient @xmath39 is usual extracted phenomenologically from heavy ion collision experiments and may range from @xmath40 . in this work",
    ", we shall consider this effective viscosity , but also use temperature dependent parametrizations of @xmath41 .",
    "as already mentioned , the validity of the fluid - dynamical description can be quantified by the knudsen number , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the microscopic and macroscopic distance / time scales , respectively . for a dilute gas",
    ", @xmath43 is the mean free - path of the particles and one can show that @xmath45 . for a strongly interacting system ,",
    "the microscopic scale is not well known , but we shall continue to assume that it is proportional to the shear relaxation time , that is , @xmath46 we also note that the shear relaxation time is the only microscopic scale that directly enters into eq .",
    "( [ eq : shear_eq ] ) . the macroscopic scale should be estimated from gradients of the macroscopic variables . here",
    ", we consider the following estimates for this scale @xmath47 that is , we only estimate the knudsen number using different combinations of gradients of velocity or the local energy density .",
    "the corresponding knudsen numbers are then given as @xmath48 .",
    "we note that in perfect fluid dynamics the scales and are algebraically related , but the same does not hold in viscous fluid dynamics where the difference depends also on the gradients of the shear - stress tensor . as a matter of fact , in viscous fluid dynamics @xmath49 and @xmath50 give rise to rather different macroscopic scales .",
    "for the sake of completeness we listed all the possible macroscopic scales that could be constructed from the gradients of velocity and of thermodynamic variables . however , in all the fluid - dynamical simulations performed for the purposes of this paper , the macroscopic scales @xmath51 and @xmath50 were always considerably smaller than all the others .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain the domain of applicability of fluid dynamics , it is enough to compare the microscopic scale only to @xmath51 and @xmath50 .",
    "the range of knudsen number values for which relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics remains valid has been estimated by comparing fluid - dynamical solutions to numerical solutions of the boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "such studies were performed considering dilute systems , for which the boltzmann equation is able to provide a reasonable description .",
    "nevertheless , they should still be able to provide some understanding about the range of applicability of fluid dynamics in terms of the knudsen number for other types of fluids .",
    "so far , the best information on these limits come from comparing the solutions of israel - stewart theory to numerical solutions of the boltzmann equation in simplified situations , such as ( 1 + 1)dimensional shock problem  @xcite or ( 0 + 1)dimensional bjorken expansion  @xcite . in these situations",
    "it was found that a @xmath52 is required to get a good agreement between israel - stewart theory and the relativistic boltzmann equation .",
    "we note that the two tests mentioned above were done with israel - stewart theory , which is not the exact fluid - dynamical limit of the boltzmann equation , see refs .",
    "@xcite . nevertheless , the fact that the two very different tests give the same limit for @xmath53 , makes us confident that @xmath54 provides a reasonable estimate for the limit of applicability of fluid dynamics . in this paper",
    ", we assume that this limit can be applied to the knudsen number defined from the smallest macroscopic scale , that is , @xmath55    besides the perfect fluid limit @xmath56 , another extreme behavior is the limit in which the microscopic scales become much longer than the macroscopic ones , i.e. , @xmath57 . in this case",
    "the fluid breaks into free streaming particles . in practice one expects free streaming to become a good approximation to the evolution when viscosity becomes so large that @xmath58 , see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite , for a demonstration of a transition from fluid like behavior to a free streaming behavior . in heavy ion collisions",
    "this transition is called decoupling or freeze - out , which usually is taken to happen at constant temperature , rather than determined from the condition @xmath59 , see however , refs .",
    "@xcite for a discussion on these kind of dynamical decoupling conditions .",
    "besides the knudsen number , one can quantify the applicability of fluid dynamics using the inverse reynolds number , @xmath60 in the navier - stokes limit , where @xmath61 , the inverse reynolds number becomes proportional to the knudsen number .",
    "however , in israel - stewart theory the shear - stress tensor satisfies a partial differential equation in which @xmath62 enters only as a source term . in this sense , the shear - stress tensor does not have to be equal to the navier - stokes value and the inverse reynolds number corresponds to another measure to understand the applicability of fluid dynamics .    in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we shall verify how much the fluid - dynamical description can be driven out of its domain of applicability due to the large gradients present in a heavy ion collision .",
    "of course , one should notice that it is basically not known how the breaking of the fluid - dynamical description will affect the different heavy ion observables .",
    "such a thing can not be tested solely within a fluid - dynamical model . in this sense",
    ", the phenomenological implication of our findings will not be fully addressed in this work .",
    "the main ingredients that affect the spacetime evolution and the values of the knudsen numbers are the initial energy density profile , initialization time @xmath63 and , obviously , the values of @xmath41 . in order to better estimate the uncertainties in calculating the knudsen numbers",
    ", we shall consider several different choices for these parameters .",
    "although we consider here a full ( 3 + 1)dimensional expansion , the longitudinal expansion is treated analytically by assuming longitudinal boost - invariance . within this approximation",
    "the longitudinal flow velocity is given by @xmath64 , and the fluid dynamical quantities become independent of the spacetime rapidity @xmath65 $ ] , i.e. , they depend on the transverse coordinates , @xmath66 , and the longitudinal proper time , @xmath67 , only . from a numerical point of view , this reduces the ( 3 + 1)dimensional problem to a ( 2 + 1)dimensional one . in this case",
    "it is also enough to give the initial conditions in the transverse plane only .    for the initial state in aa collisions",
    "we use two limits based on the optical glauber model , ebc and ewn @xcite , where the energy density is proportional either to the density of binary collision ( ebc ) , @xmath68 or to the density of wounded nucleons ( ewn ) , @xmath69   \\notag \\\\ + & ct_a(\\mathbf{x}+\\frac{\\mathbf{b}}{2})\\left [ 1 -\\left(1- \\frac{% \\sigma_{nn}t_a(\\mathbf{x}-\\frac{\\mathbf{b}}{2})}{a}\\right)^a\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the impact parameter , and @xmath71 is the standard nuclear overlap function , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the nucleon density parametrized as wood - saxon profile and @xmath74 is the total inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross - section . in order to fully specify the initial conditions",

    "such initial profile should be good enough to estimate the knudsen numbers reached in pa collisions .",
    "the proportionality constants are fixed in such way that the multiplicity in the @xmath81 % most central aa collisions at rhic and the lhc is reproduced . for the p+a collisions we consider several choices that give different final multiplicities .",

    "on the other hand , the same can not be said about the shear viscosity coefficient .",
    "even the qualitative behavior of the knudsen numbers can change significantly as one varies this transport coefficient .    for the case of a constant @xmath94 ,",
    "the knudsen numbers are below the applicability limit @xmath108 almost throughout all the spacetime evolution , with an exception at the edge of the fireball where the energy density gradients are very large . at small radius",

    "the common practice in simulations of heavy ion collisions is just to switch at a constant temperature hypersurface .",
    "we note that the knudsen numbers are basically linear with the shear viscosity coefficient . the larger the shear viscosity ,",

    "we found that two macroscopic scales , the expansion rate and the energy density gradient , always give the tightest limits for the applicability of fluid dynamics .",
    "the expansion rate is the dominant macroscopic scale during the early stages of the evolution and near the center of the system , while the energy density gradients are large near the edge of the system .",
    "other estimates of the macroscopic scales give typically knudsen numbers much smaller than these two choices .",
    "obviously , the exact values of the knudsen numbers depend strongly on the chosen @xmath41 parametrization .",
    "for example in aa collisions with a constant @xmath1 the whole evolution is always below the applicability limit @xmath147 , but leads to a rather strange picture where the system never fully decouples to a free - streaming particles .",
    "on the other hand , the temperature dependent parametrizations considered here give a decoupling region with a similar shape as constant temperature contours .",
    "it then depends on the high - temperature behavior of @xmath41 , whether almost all the qgp evolution is describable with fluid dynamics , or just a small region around the qcd transition . in ppb collisions the situation is considerably more difficult : knudsen numbers are above the applicability limit almost during the whole evolution even with a small constant @xmath1 in the qgp phase .    based on the calculated values of the knudsen numbers , we further estimated the maximum allowed @xmath41 for the fluid dynamical description to be valid for the heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the uncertainties in these estimates were determined by varying the initial conditions , initialization time and the @xmath41 parametrizations in the actual fluid dynamic calculation . in aa collisions we found that these estimates give @xmath41 limits that are of the same order than the typical values of @xmath148 found from the comparisons between the rhic and lhc data with the predictions of fluid dynamical models for aa collisions  @xcite .",
    "the limits depend on the centrality of the collision , dropping by approximately a factor of two from central ( 0 - 5 % ) to peripheral ( 70 - 80 % ) collisions .",
    "the difference between rhic and lhc is small .",
    "although , these estimates indicate that fluid dynamics is applicable in heavy ion collisions , perhaps even at quantitative level , we are still very close to the applicability limit and there can still be large corrections to spacetime evolution even in central collisions .",
    "furthermore , we can not reliably study simulations with larger values of @xmath2 without using a description that goes beyond usual fluid dynamics .",
    "the situation for pa collisions is even more difficult , as the @xmath41 limit is already clearly below @xmath149 and depends only weakly on the charged particle multiplicity .",
    "as one expects that a same type of matter is created both in aa and pa collisions , the transport properties of the matter should also be the same .",
    "this makes it hard to trust quantitatively the predictions of fluid dynamics in pa collisions .",
    "we have not considered event - by - event fluctuations of the initial densities here , but we note that including those could bring the local conditions in aa collisions closer to the conditions in pa collisions .",
