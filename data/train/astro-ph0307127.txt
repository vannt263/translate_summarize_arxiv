    "pds 456 is a luminous , low redshift ( @xmath7 ) radio - quiet quasar identified in 1997 @xcite .",
    "the optical and infra - red spectra @xcite show broad balmer and paschen lines ( e.g. h@xmath8 fwhm 3000 km  s@xmath1 ) , strong fe ii , a hard ( de - reddened ) optical continuum ( @xmath9 ) , and one of the strongest ` big blue bumps ' of any agn @xcite .",
    "pds  456 has a de - reddened , absolute blue magnitude of m@xmath10 @xcite , making it at least as luminous as the radio - loud quasar 3c  273 .",
    "indeed pds 456 is the most luminous known agn in the local universe ( z  @xmath11 ) , its luminosity being more typical of quasars at z=2 - 3 , at the peak of the quasar luminosity function .",
    "pds 456 was first detected as the x - ray source rxs j172819.3 - 141600 in the _ rosat _ all sky survey @xcite .",
    "subsequent _ asca _  and _ rxte _  and _ bepposax _",
    "observations showed that it was highly x - ray variable @xcite , requiring that the x - ray source was very compact ( @xmath12  schwarzschild radii ) and accreting with a unusually high efficiency ( between 6% and 41% ) , close to the limit for rotating kerr black hole @xcite .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of pds 456 , obtained by _ asca _  and",
    "_ rxte _ also appeared to be unusual for a quasar . a strong edge like",
    "feature was present in the iron k - shell band , either due to a highly ionized absorber or reflector , whilst absorption towards the soft x - ray band was also observed @xcite .",
    "xmm - newton _  observation of pds 456 was subsequently obtained in ao-1 , in order to obtain high signal to noise spectra of both the iron k - shell complex with the epic ccd detectors and a high resolution spectrum of the soft x - ray absorber with the _ xmm - newton _  rgs ( reflection grating spectrometer ) . here",
    "we report on the x - ray spectra obtained through the _ xmm - newton _  observations of pds 456 , which reveal evidence for a massive outflow , with a velocity of @xmath0  km  s@xmath1 . a previous paper @xcite discussed in detail the x - ray variability during the _ xmm - newton _  observation and a simultaneous week long _ bepposax _  observation .",
    "pds 456 was observed by _ xmm - newton _  on 2001 february 26th with a duration of 40 ks .",
    "data were taken with the epic - pn detector @xcite in full window mode and with the epic - mos detector @xcite in large window mode .",
    "the data was reduced using version 5.4 of the xmm - sas software .",
    "note that the time - averaged , 0.5 - 10 kev flux of pds  456 during the observation was @xmath13  ergs  @xmath3  s@xmath1 ; at this flux level the effect of photon pile - up is small ( @xmath14% ) .",
    "all time intervals were included , as the observation contained no background flares .",
    "data were selected using event patterns 0 - 12 ( for the mos ) and pattern 0 - 4 ( for the pn ) and only good x - ray events were included .",
    "the spectra were extracted from circular source regions of 40  radius , whilst background spectra were extracted from an offset circle , close to pds 456 , but free of any background sources .",
    "response matrices and ancillary response files were generated using the sas tasks rmfgen and arfgen respectively .",
    "background subtracted spectra were fitted using xspec v11.2 , including data over the energy ranges 0.4 to 12 kev for the epic - pn and 0.4 kev to 10 kev for the co - added epic - mos spectrum . a galactic absorption column of @xmath15  @xmath3 @xcite was included in all the fits .",
    "a single absorbed power - law fit ( photon index , @xmath16 ) to both mos and pn data is clearly inadequate ( reduced @xmath17 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the data / model ratio to this power - law , a strong soft excess is observed below 1 kev and a large drop in counts is observed above 7 kev in the iron k - shell band .",
    "the mos and pn spectra are consistent , except below 0.5  kev where there is a small divergence in spectral slope .",
    "initially , to model the iron k - shell band , the data were fitted from 2 - 12 kev ( or 2 - 10 kev for epic - mos ) , so that the effects of the large soft excess are negligible .",
    "as the epic - pn data contained significantly more counts than the epic - mos at the highest energies , we proceeded to fit the epic - pn data only .",
    "the ratio spectrum above 2 kev to a power - law fitted over the 2 - 5 kev range ( i.e. outside of the iron k band ) is shown in the inset to figure 1 .",
    "a strong deficit of counts occurs above 7 kev , where one would expect to observe k - shell absorption edges from highly ionized iron .",
    "indeed a simple galactic absorbed power - law produced a poor fit ( @xmath18 , null hypothesis probability @xmath19 ) .    adding three absorption edges between 7 and 10 kev",
    "significantly improves the fit ( @xmath20 ) , modeling the broad fe absorption feature present in the x - ray spectrum .",
    "the energies ( in the quasar rest frame ) and optical depths of the edges are then ; @xmath21  kev , @xmath22  kev and @xmath23  kev with @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 respectively .",
    "the breadth of the absorption feature suggests that a wide range of ionizations may be present , whilst the depth of the feature implies a column of gas of @xmath27  @xmath3 .",
    "note that the upper limit to a narrow ( i.e. unresolved ) fe emission line ( in the energy range 6.4 - 6.97 kev ) is @xmath28  12  ev , implying that the solid angle subtended by the absorber must be small ( @xmath29  steradian ) .",
    "note that an extreme broad iron k@xmath30 emission line from an accretion disk can not model the shape of the spectrum from 2 - 12 kev . if one attempts to model the spectrum with a fe line profile from a rapidly rotating kerr black hole @xcite , the physical parameters required are unphysical ( disk emissivity @xmath31 , inclination=90 , equivalent width @xmath32  kev ) , because the line is ( unsuccessfully ) attempting to model the broad absorption dip above 7 kev with the blue - wing of the line profile .    to obtain a more physical representation of the fe k - shell absorber , we used a grid of models generated by the xstar photoionization code @xcite to fit the epic - pn data above 2 kev .",
    "solar elemental abundances were assumed , whilst a turbulence velocity of 1000  km  s@xmath1 was used .",
    "a one zone photoionization model was adopted , with the column density ( @xmath33 ) , ionization parameter ( @xmath34 ) , partial covering fraction ( @xmath35 ) and outflow velocity ( @xmath36 ) as free parameters . an effective hydrogen column density ( for a solar abundance h / fe ratio ) of @xmath37  @xmath3",
    "is required , together with an ionization parameter of @xmath38 and a partial covering fraction of @xmath39 , whilst the power - law continuum steepens to @xmath40 . at this ionization state",
    "most of the absorption is due to fe  xvii - fe  xxiv ( i.e. where the l - shell is partially filled ) .",
    "the best fit spectrum modeled by xstar is shown in figure 2 ( panel a ) , the depth and energy of the absorption feature being well matched , whilst the partial covering warm absorber also models the convex spectral curvature ( through the increase in opacity at lower energies due to iron l - shell absorption ) present in the epic - pn data between 2 - 6 kev .",
    "overall , the fit statistic for this model is excellent ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "importantly a large outflow velocity of 47000  km  s@xmath1 ( 90% confidence limits , 36000  km  s@xmath1  82000  km  s@xmath1 ) is needed to model the spectrum .",
    "although the exact outflow velocity is not well constrained by the epic - pn data alone , a significant outflow velocity is still required .",
    "figure 2(b ) illustrates this point , if one fixes the absorber velocity to zero , then the model fit becomes poor as the iron k edges then lie at a significantly lower energy than is observed in the epic data .",
    "indeed if one tries to increase the energy of the model absorption feature by increasing the ionization state of the absorber ( so that he and h - like iron dominates ) , the result is a worse fit still , partly because the absorption edge feature becomes weaker ( as a significant fraction of iron becomes fully ionized ) and also because the most prominent absorption features are now the strong k@xmath30 and k@xmath8 absorption lines due to fe xxvi which are not present in the actual _ xmm - newton _  data ( figure 2c ) .",
    "thus a significant outflow velocity is _ required _ by the data , indeed one can place a conservative lower - limit ( at 99.9% confidence ) on the velocity of 24000  km  s@xmath1 ( or @xmath42 ) .",
    "extrapolation of the hard x - ray spectrum to lower energies ( down to 0.4 kev ) , leaves clear residuals in the epic mos and pn data ( e.g. figure 1 ) .",
    "a strong soft excess is present below 1 kev , whilst residuals due to an additional absorber may also be present in the soft x - ray band . to investigate this at higher spectral resolution",
    ", we used data available from the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) below 2 kev .",
    "the most noticeable feature present is a broad absorption trough observed between 12 - 15     ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "the feature is highly significant , being detected at @xmath43 confidence . when parameterized by a simple broad gaussian shaped absorption line , the best fit parameters ( in the quasar rest frame ) are @xmath44  kev with an equivalent width of @xmath45  ev and a velocity width of @xmath46  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "as in the previous section , we used our grid of photoionization models to characterize the properties of the absorbing gas , apparent in the rgs spectrum . a lower column density ( @xmath47  @xmath3 ) is required to fit the data , whilst both a similar ionization parameter ( @xmath48 ) and outflow velocity ( with @xmath49  km  s@xmath1 ) are needed , as per the fits to the epic - pn data .",
    "partial covering is not required in the rgs fits .",
    "the photon index obtained ( @xmath50 , after correcting for absorption ) is consistent with the epic - pn data , whilst a soft blackbody component ( with @xmath51  ev ) is also needed in the fit .",
    "the lower column density derived from the rgs fit indicates that the absorber is patchy and thus is likely to be located quite close to the x - ray source .",
    "thus we see a higher ( partially covered ) column along the line of sight towards the hard x - ray continuum , whilst the column towards the soft x - ray continuum is lower .",
    "inspection of the best - fit photoionization model implies that a blend of l - shell transitions from fe  xvii ",
    "fe  xxiv as well as k - shell absorption from ne  ix / x is responsible for the broad absorption feature at 12 - 15   .",
    "a weak ly-@xmath30 absorption line due to o  viii may also be present at 19   .",
    "the outflow velocity derived appears robust , due to the positioning of the broad absorption feature .",
    "if one fixes the absorber velocity at zero in the quasar rest - frame , then the fe l - shell absorption _ in the model _ is located at energies below the observed absorption trough , whilst increasing the ionization of the absorber only serves to significantly weaken the soft x - ray absorber .",
    "x - ray spectroscopy of pds 456 with _ xmm - newton _  has revealed a high column density ( @xmath52  @xmath3 ) , highly ionized ( log  @xmath4 ) warm absorber , its main signature being a series of k and l shell absorption edges and lines due to iron in the ionization range fe  xvii  fe  xxiv . crucially , a near relativistic outflow velocity is required , of the order 50000  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "this velocity is similar to the actual systemic velocity of pds 456 ( at @xmath7 ) , therefore it is possible that the absorbing material is unrelated to the quasar , and is local to our galaxy .",
    "however we consider it extremely unlikely that such a high column , highly ionized absorber could occur by chance along the local line of sight .",
    "furthermore , although the galactic column towards pds 456 is moderately high ( @xmath53@xmath3 ) , this _ neutral _ absorption does not contribute towards the features seen in the iron k and l - shell bands , and in any event has been accounted for in all our modeling .",
    "therefore it is highly probable that the absorber is intrinsic to the quasar pds  456 .",
    "the combination of a large column density , high ionization and a fast outflow velocity in pds 456 indicates that the absorber is located close to the quasar s central engine and that its mass outflow rate is significant relative the to the accretion rate .",
    "maximum _ distance to the absorber can be calculated on the condition that its thickness ( @xmath54 ) can not exceed its distance from the ionizing source ( @xmath55 ) , i.e. @xmath56 .",
    "this requires that @xmath57 ( where @xmath58 ) for a black hole mass of @xmath59 for pds 456 @xcite , thus it is located within the blr .",
    "one likely possibility is that the absorber arises through a disk driven outflow or wind .",
    "the exact origin of these winds and the mechanism responsible for driving them ( radiation and/or magnetic ) is unclear . for broad absorption line ( bal )",
    "qsos , line driven winds have been proposed @xcite as well as centrifugal driving along open magnetic field lines @xcite .    using conservation of mass ,",
    "the outflow rate ( @xmath60 ) for an outflow subtending a solid angle of @xmath61  steradian with a constant velocity @xmath36 is given by:-",
    "@xmath62 where @xmath63 is the density , @xmath64 the distance from the x - ray source and @xmath65 the proton mass .",
    "now the ionization parameter @xmath34 is defined as @xmath66 , so we can obtain:-    @xmath67 from the observations , the hard x - ray luminosity of pds 456 ( above 2 kev ) is @xmath68  erg  s@xmath1 , the ionization parameter is @xmath69 , whilst @xmath70  km  s@xmath1 . from the lack of any iron",
    "k line emission it is likely that the outflow subtends a solid angle of @xmath71  steradian .",
    "however even for a conservative value of 0.1  steradian , the mass outflow rate derived is @xmath72  g  s@xmath1 or @xmath73  year@xmath1 .",
    "a lower limit of @xmath74  year@xmath1 is obtained using the 99.9% confidence lower bound on the outflow velocity of @xmath75  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "note the outflow rate calculated assumes the gas is in equlibrium , if the gas is being accelerated then the actual rate may differ .",
    "pds 456 is an extremely luminous quasar with a bolometric luminosity of @xmath76  erg  s@xmath1 and a black hole mass of @xmath77 assuming accretion occurs near the eddington limit @xcite .",
    "the mass accretion rate for pds 456 , given by @xmath78 , is @xmath79  year@xmath1 , for an efficiency of @xmath80 .",
    "thus it seems likely the outflow rate is of the same order as the mass accretion rate in pds 456 .",
    "similarly the kinetic output of the outflow in pds 456 is large , about @xmath81  erg  s@xmath1 corresponding to 10% of the bolometric output of the quasar .",
    "the high velocity also implies that the outflow is likely to be driven from the accretion disk at a fairly small radius . for a keplerian disk ,",
    "the launch radius for the outflow is simply @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the escape velocity of the material . assuming that @xmath84 ( although some acceleration of the matter will probably occur )",
    ", this implies that the outflow in pds 456 is launched from a radius of @xmath85 ( about @xmath86  cm for a @xmath87m@xmath88 black hole ) .",
    "indeed the launch radius may be smaller if the gas is not in simple equilibrium .",
    "pds 456 appears to be in a small but growing group of agn to show extreme absorption properties in the iron k - shell band . the lensed bal quasar apm  08279 + 5255 has been found to exhibit iron k absorption lines and/or edges @xcite in both _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _  observations . a similar absorber has also been reported in the bal quasar pg 1115 + 080 @xcite .",
    "the outflow velocities are similar to pds 456 , in the range @xmath89",
    ". given this apparent association between high velocity x - ray outflowing gas and the uv bals , one may predict to see bal features in the uv spectrum of pds 456 . indeed a _",
    "hst - stis _ spectrum of pds 456 ( obrien et al .",
    "2003 , in preparation ) reveals that there may be cooler gas in the outflow ; a bal is seen in lyman-@xmath30 with an outflow velocity of 12000  22000  km  s@xmath1 , whilst the c iv emission line is also blue - shifted by @xmath90  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "thus pds 456 may just reside at the extreme end of the bal quasar population @xcite .",
    "similar highly ionized x - ray outflows have recently been discovered in the non - bal radio - quiet quasars pg 1211 + 143 and pg 0844 + 349 @xcite , suggesting that these properties are not unique to uv identified bal quasars .",
    "we also note that strong iron k absorption has also been observed in the nls1s 1h  0707 - 495 and iras  13324 - 3809 @xcite and also in some x - ray binaries , e.g. grs 1915 + 105 @xcite , gx  13 + 1 @xcite , x  1624 - 490 @xcite . in the quasars pds 456 , pg 1211 + 143 and pg 0844 + 349 , the x - ray columns are near to @xmath91@xmath3 , the outflow velocities measured are @xmath92 , whilst the ionizations are also similar ( @xmath93 ) . using pg  1211 + 143 as an example ,",
    "@xcite have recently demonstrated , for radiatively driven outflows , that objects accreting near to the eddington rate are likely to contain massive ( @xmath94 ) compton - thick winds .",
    "indeed when the outflow rate is of the same order as the accretion rate , the flow can become optically thick at @xmath95 .",
    "this can account for both the high columns and velocities of the x - ray outflows , as well as provide a natural source of thermalized photons for the uv and soft x - ray excesses observed in these quasars .",
    "however other scenarios are possible , for instance @xcite recently used a magnetic flare model to explain the rapid x - ray variability in pds 456 , through coherent flaring events occuring when the accretion rate is close to eddington .",
    "indeed it is conceivable that the outflowing matter in pds 456 is the ejecta associated with these flares .",
    "interestingly the output of the magnetic events ( @xmath96  erg  s@xmath1 ) in pds 456 is very similar to the kinetic power of the outflow , so this scenario seems energetically plausible .",
    "overall the extreme properties of the outflow in pds 456 seem linked to its high accretion rate @xcite , which appears to drive the energetics of its unusually massive outflow .",
    "this paper is based on observations obtained with xmm - newton , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) .",
