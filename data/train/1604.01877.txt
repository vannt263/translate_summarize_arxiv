    "as it happens , much of the work on qg turbulence has focussed on the limit @xmath5 , i.e.  an infinite deformation scale . when @xmath6 , jet formation is anticipated due to two constraints ; namely , the transfer of energy to larger scales , and to smaller frequencies @xcite .",
    "the dispersion relation of rossby waves ( when linearized about a state of rest ) reads , @xmath7 therefore , if @xmath6 , it is not possible to maintain isotropy ( i.e.  @xmath8 ) while satisfying both these constraints .",
    "an expected consequence is the  flattening of eddies \" or a transfer of energy to modes with @xmath9 ; in other words , the generation of zonal flows @xcite . to be sure , there is more to jet formation than these constraints ; for example , two ( not necessarily unrelated ) viewpoints include ( i ) a systematic isotropic inverse transfer of energy which at some length scale is diverted to zonal modes ( see for example the elaborate discussion in sukoriansky et al .",

    "more broadly , connaughton et al .",
    "@xcite provide a useful and up - to - date review of instabilities , the role of invariants , and classes of nonlinear interactions thought to play a role in zonal flow formation .",
    "physically , @xmath0 in ( [ 1 ] ) allows for the presence of rossby waves @xcite , while a finite @xmath4 reflects the effects of a free upper surface in the qg dynamics of a single shallow water layer of fluid @xcite .",
    "another way to look at ( [ 1 ] ) is to view it as a qg approximation to the dynamics of the active layer in a two layer system ( with the other layer being inert ) . in this framework ,",
    "the finite deformation radius is a measure of the reciprocal of the divergence of the flow @xcite . even though effects of a finite @xmath4 and @xmath10 on the linear stability of jets and predictability of geophysical flows have a long history",
    "( see for example , lipps @xcite and holloway @xcite , respectively ) this regime has attracted renewed attention in the context of the formation of jets on jupiter and saturn @xcite , in the earth s",
    "oceans @xcite , and more generally as a local model for planetary atmospheres @xcite . indeed , as described by smith @xcite",
    ", the presence of both these terms together can have significant effects on the nonlinear evolution of the system ( interestingly , when @xmath4 is finite , @xmath0 is usually set to zero , and studies have focussed on the so - called equivalent barotropic model @xcite .",
    "in fact , the limit @xmath11 of the equivalent barotropic model , referred to as the asymptotic @xcite , or ",
    "ideal 2d \" limit @xcite , has also received a fair amount of attention . )",
    ".      examining ( [ 3 ] ) , smith @xcite noted that @xmath15 depends on @xmath17 , and that @xmath17 is a part of the problem , rather than an externally prescribed entity .",
    "taking the problem to be forced with a fixed energy source , and assuming an inertial range where energy is predominantly transferred upscale , it becomes possible to provide an estimate of @xmath17 .",
    "viewed in this manner , the only free parameter is @xmath0 ; thus , for given spectral properties of energy and its rate of input into the system , at fixed @xmath4 , there is a threshold @xmath0 for which zonal flows are expected to form @xcite .",
    "interestingly , even though the analysis of qg turbulence in wavenumber domain has a long history , the distribution , scaling and fluxes in frequency domain have only been examined recently .",
    "for example , with an infinite deformation radius , sukoriansky et al .",
    "@xcite show that rossby waves co - exist with jets in a fully developed turbulent state ( see also the discussion on non - zonal coherent structures in bakas and ioannou @xcite ) ; a fact supported by the analysis of laboratory experiments @xcite . notably , the comprehensive study by arbic et al .",
    "@xcite of a two - layer @xmath18-plane qg system ( see also , berloff and kamenkovich @xcite ) , ocean circulation models and surface current data has added significantly to the overall picture of energy distribution in the frequency domain .    in the present work ,",
    "we focus on ( [ 1 ] ) and consider both @xmath19 and well as finite @xmath4 in the presence of the @xmath0 effect .",
    "the formation of jets or vortices ( depending on @xmath4 ) , scaling of spectra in wavenumber space as well as the inverse transfer of kinetic and potential energy is verified ( section 2 ) .",
    "we then proceed to examine the emergent fields in the frequency domain ; a systematic transfer of energy to smaller frequencies and the establishment of a power - law scaling is noted . in the jet forming cases , it is seen that the inverse transfer only proceeds up to a certain frequency , below which the spectra show significant isolated peaks . on the other hand ,",
    "the inverse transfer and power - law ( close to -5/3 slope ) holds over a larger range of frequencies without jets .",
    "even though the shifting of the peaks to lower frequencies with an increasing deformation radius is consistent with the rossby dispersion relation ; it is the decomposition the spectra into frequency - zonal wavenumber and frequency - meridional wavenumber diagrams that makes it possible to identify the modulating disturbances as rossby waves and quantify their scales ( section 3 ) .",
    "finally , the results are collected and discussed in section 4 .",
    "for purposes of numerical simulation we prefer to deal with a non - dimensional form of ( [ 1 ] ) ; in particular , choosing length and velocity scale parameters @xmath20 , respectively , this yields , @xmath21 + \\frac{1}{r_h } \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x } = 0 , \\label{4}\\ ] ] where , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( rhines number ) are two non - dimensional parameters . for @xmath6 , the length scale that emerges naturally from ( [ 1 ] )",
    "is the rhines scale @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , choosing @xmath24 while @xmath25 . in the simulations we consider a series of deformation scales , namely , @xmath26 and 1/15 ,",
    "thus for a fixed @xmath27 , we span @xmath28 , i.e. , we straddle the balance @xmath29 where @xmath30 ( note that @xmath15 depends on @xmath17 and is determined _ a posteriori _ , in fact , it varies between 1/4.5 and 1/6.5 in the various cases considered ) .",
    "the numerical simulations are pseudo - spectral in nature , the domain is doubly periodic , the forcing is spectrally localized at small scales , and time stepping is done via a runge - kutta fourth order integrator .",
    "a high order hyperdissipation is employed to remove energy at small scales and linear drag is used to extract energy at large scales . in particular , the energy sink comprises of ( @xmath31 , where @xmath32 represents the linear drag , @xmath33 is the hyperviscosity and @xmath34 . in all our simulations @xmath35 and @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 being the number of grid points @xcite .",
    "a random markovian formulation is used for forcing ( @xmath40 ) , i.e. , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is a random number in @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the wavelength - dependent forcing amplitude , @xmath45 is the correlation coefficient and the subscript on @xmath40 denotes the timestep @xcite .",
    "the forcing is restricted to @xmath46 . in our simulations @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "all results are reported at a resolution of @xmath49 , though a variety of cases were tested at 512 @xmath50 512 resolution .",
    "apart from spectra and fluxes in the wavenumber domain , we analyze the data generated in combined frequency - wavenumber diagrams .",
    "these diagrams are widely used in atmospheric analyses , especially tropical meteorology ( see for example , wheeler and kiladis @xcite ) . in particular , they allow a direct comparison with theoretically calculated dispersion relations , and thus an identification of the kind of waves that are present in the data being examined . specifically , a longitude - time plot of the zonal velocity is generated by selecting a particular latitude .",
    "this data is then transformed and normalized to obtain a frequency - zonal wavenumber spectra .",
    "similarly , by fixing the longitude and generating a latitude - time plot , frequency - meridional wavenumber plots are obtained .",
    "the energy flux is calculated by @xcite , @xmath51 where @xmath52 $ ] , and @xmath53 denotes a complex conjugate . equation ( [ 5 ] ) is averaged over all @xmath54 to obtain @xmath55 , the flux as a function of frequency .",
    "inspecting the anisotropy of the various runs ( figure [ anisotropy ] ) , i.e. , the ratio @xmath56 ( where @xmath57 denotes a spatial average ) , we observe clear zonal flow domination or jet formation for @xmath58 and 1/5 , with an anisotropy of 0.85 , 0.75 and 0.65 respectively .",
    "as expected , the jets are asymmetric in the east - west direction and are associated with a ramp like structure in the vorticity field ( not shown ) . in each of these cases the rhines scale ( @xmath15 ) is approximately 1/5 , and we observe 5 - 6 jets in the system at equilibrium .",
    "also , once the jets form they are persistent in the sense their number remains the same and their zonal mean profile is qualitatively similar .",
    "the formation of jets is consistent with criterion ( [ 3 ] ) derived by okuno and masuda @xcite . in addition , based on the energy input to the system , we note that whenever jets form , the critical @xmath0 criterion of smith @xcite , namely @xmath59 ( where @xmath60 is the energy input rate ) is also satisfied .",
    "it is known that the spectra in jet forming cases are anisotropic ( see for example , sukoriansky et al .",
    "@xcite ) , in particular , with respect to @xmath61 ( illustrative case of @xmath62 shown in the first panel of figure [ ekspectra ] ) , the slope steepens as one progresses to lower wavenumbers and we observe a  piling up \" of energy at scales that are slightly greater than the rhines scale .",
    "in fact , the transition scale ( @xmath12 )  also called the modified rhines scale @xcite  turns out to be a reasonable measure of this length scale . on the other hand ,",
    "the scaling with respect to @xmath63 is smoother ( and proceeds to largest scales available where it is arrested by the drag imposed on the simulation ) with the kinetic energy ( ke ) and potential energy ( pe ) following a -5/3 and -11/3 power - law , respectively .",
    "the case @xmath64 is somewhat borderline with an anisotropy of 0.6 and for @xmath65 and 1/15 there are no jets , rather the fields consist of small - scale isotropic vortices and the anisotropy fluctuates about 0.5 . in conformity with okuno and masuda @xcite and smith @xcite , these cases do not satisfy their jet formation criteria .",
    "in fact , with progressively smaller deformation scales , the emergence of isotropic vortices ( which do not merge , but retain their small scales ) is consistent with the behavior of the @xmath11 limit of the equivalent barotropic model @xcite .",
    "irrespective of whether jets form or not , there is a systematic inverse transfer of kinetic and potential energy .",
    "as noted earlier @xcite , the spectra cross at @xmath4 ( illustrative examples with and without jets are shown in the two panels of figure [ ekspectra ] ) with the ke and pe dominating for scales smaller and larger than the deformation scale , respectively . note that the spectra in the non jet case are isotropic , and have been shown with respect to @xmath66 .",
    "the flux of ke falls off by the deformation scale ( figure [ flux ] ) , while the pe dominates the inverse flux at scales larger than @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , the flux of total energy is relatively steady over a fairly large range of scales , and its spectrum follows the pe for @xmath67 and ke for @xmath68 , thus exhibiting a natural transition from a steep ( -11/3 ) to shallow ( -5/3 ) spectrum at @xmath4 ( this is especially clear in the non jet forming cases , as seen in the illustrative plot in the second panel of figure [ ekspectra ] ) .",

    "this is in contrast to associating a  frequency \" with turbulence ( @xmath78 ; equivalent to invoking the taylor hypothesis ) , that would result in the same functional form in wavenumber and frequency domains ( see for example the discussion of wavenumber and frequency spectra in ferrari and wunsch @xcite ) .",
    "as seen in figure [ envsfreq ] , there is some evidence of @xmath79 scaling in the ke , though it only lasts for a very limted range .",
    "further , for larger deformation scales ( the jet forming cases in the first panel of figure [ envsfreq ] ) , i.e. , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , there are systematic departures from a power - law for progressively smaller frequencies .",
    "note that , for these deformation scales , the pe contains a much smaller energy at higher frequencies and its spectrum shows no clear power - law .",
    "these deviations in ke are in the form of isolated peaks , and their decreasing frequency ( with increasing @xmath4 ) is consistent with the rossby dispersion relation . not only do the peaks shift to lower frequencies with a decreasing deformation scale , they become muted , and in fact , the power - law scaling of ke in the non - jet forming cases is much clearer and persists to the lowest frequencies sampled ( second panel of figure [ envsfreq ] ) . also , the best - fit slopes for ke in the non - jet forming cases are close to -5/3 ( this is in accord with simulations of the pure 2d system ( not shown ) , i.e. , @xmath82 , that yield an extensive power - law that scales almost exactly with a -5/3 slope in frequency and wavenumber space ) .",
    "interestingly , the pe in the non - jet forming simulations falls off quite rapidly at low frequencies and levels off to a relatively steep slope ( steeper than -2 ) , as compared to the ke , for higher frequencies ( dashed lines in the second panel of figure [ envsfreq ] ) .",
    "thus , we have an interesting set of observations wherein the scaling of the ke with respect to frequency for jet forming cases ( at least at large frequencies ) shows some evidence of a steeper than -5/3 ( possibly consistent with a -2 slope ) power - law though the scaling is delicate as the range of its validity is very small , while the isotropic non - jet forming cases appear to follow taylor s hypothesis and exhibit a fairly clear @xmath83 -5/3 scaling in ke but show a steeper slope in the pe ( note that even though the pe slope is steeper than the ke , the two do not differ by -2 as was seen in the wavenumber spectra ) .",
    "indeed , much like wavenumber space , the total energy in the non - jet forming cases again exhibits a transition from a steep ( pe dominated ) to shallow ( ke dominated ) form with increasing frequency .",
    "the transition point of the ke and pe spectra is in fair agreement with a straightforward translation of the deformation scale to the frequency domain by using the the observed @xmath17 as a conversion factor .    in all cases ,",
    "there is a flux of ke from larger to smaller frequencies , this is seen in figure [ freqflux ] .",
    "note that the inverse flux in the frequency domain is broader than in wavenumber space @xcite .",
    "interestingly , comparing figure [ envsfreq ] and [ freqflux ] , we see that the power - law scaling of ke does not correspond to an  inertial range \" in the flux , in fact , the scaling only lasts as long as the flux keeps decreasing . in both ,",

    "as noted , when jets form , @xmath12 serves as a useful indicator of the meridional scale at which energy tends to pile up ( first panel of figure [ ekspectra ] ) .",
    "thus , fixing @xmath90 as a meridional wavenumber , we examine the energy distribution in frequency - zonal wavenumber space .",
    "as described earlier , these diagrams are constructed by computing the spectra of longitude - time plots of the zonal velocity at a given latitude for multiple snapshots of the flow field .",
    "these diagrams for @xmath70 and 1/7 are shown in the four panels of figure [ fkx_jets ] . in each case , we observe a peak at @xmath91 and @xmath92 ; this is the steady zonal jet .",
    "in addition , there are peaks for small ( negative ) @xmath63 and low ( but , positive non zero ) frequencies that indicate the presence of westward moving disturbances .",
    "further , the peaks observed are consistent with low zonal wavenumber theoretical rossby dispersion curves corresponding to ( [ 1 ] ) with @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( shown as black curves in figure [ fkx_jets ] ) .",
    "note that there appears to be a slight increase in @xmath63 , or decrease in scale , of the modulating waves with progressively smaller deformation scales ; for example , with @xmath19 the spectral peaks are restricted to @xmath95 , while for @xmath64 , we see additional peaks out to @xmath96 .",
    "also , the separation between the jet ( @xmath97 ) and the other peaks tends to diminish with a decreasing deformation scale .",
    "indeed , by @xmath64 ( the borderline jet case ) , there is almost a continuous distribution of energy from zero to low frequencies .",
    "quite clearly , the energy in these frequency - zonal wavenumber diagrams is strongly localized ; in fact , one could argue that a linear dispersion relation would fit the peaks as well as rossby dispersion curves .",
    "therefore , we postpone the identification of these disturbances to the next section when we have also analyzed the frequency - meridional wavenumber diagrams .    moving to the cases when jets do not form , i.e. , @xmath72 and 1/15 ,",
    "the energy distribution in frequency - zonal wavenumber space is shown in figure [ fkx_nojets ] . here too , most of the power is in westward propagating systems and there is a possibility that the observed peaks could be associated with rossby dispersion curves . as there is no meridional length scale to guide us ,",
    "we have plotted the dispersion curves with @xmath61 that best fits the peaks in the spectra . in comparison with the jet forming simulations ,",
    "the energy is quite broadly distributed and not closely confined to the dispersion curves .",

    "qg turbulence with a finite deformation radius has been examined numerically ; our emphasis has been on an analysis of the problem in frequency and combined wavenumber - frequency domains . in line with recent work on the infinite deformation radius case",
    ", we have shown that when jets emerge in the system , they are continuously modulated by low - frequency , large - scale rossby waves . in particular , inspecting the scaling of the ke with frequency , we find some evidence of a power - law at high frequencies ( associated with an inverse transfer of energy to low frequencies ) that starts from the forcing frequency itself .",
    "further , the scaling extends to lower frequencies for progressively smaller deformation scales ; a feature consistent with the dispersion relation of rossby waves .",
    "but , whenever jets form , beyond the scaling regime , we note departures from a power - law in the form of isolated peaks in the spectrum .    in the presence of jets ,",
    "the nature of the aforementioned peaks is investigated by means of frequency - meridional wavenumber and frequency - zonal wavenumber diagrams . indeed , noting that that the modified rhines scale acts as a reasonable measure of the scale where energy piles up in the @xmath61 spectrum , we choose this as a meridional wavenumber .",
    "remarkably , apart from the steady jet , the spectral peaks of energy in the system ( on a frequency - zonal wavenumber plot ) align themselves with large - scale , low - frequency westward propagating disturbances and are consistent with the rossby dispersion curves for @xmath107 .",
    "reversing the situation , noting that the zonal scale of the modulating waves is restricted to the first few wavenumbers , we compare the corresponding dispersion curves with the spectral distribution of the energy on frequency - meridional wavenumber plots . once again , along with anticipated peaks near the transition scale , we see that almost all of the energy is closely confined to the rossby dispersion curves",
    ".    the range of parameters considered also allows us to examine non - jet forming cases . here , the flow consists of small - scale , isotropic vortices that do not merge but retain their character for the duration of the simulations .",
    "the scaling of energy , and the change from ke to pe dominance with increasing length scale , as one crosses the deformation scale , is particularly evident in these cases .",
    "indeed , here , the total energy shows a prominent transition from steep ( -11/3 ) to shallow ( -5/3 ) scaling at the radius of deformation . in frequency space ,",
    "the scaling of ke is shallower than the jet - forming cases , and is closer to a -5/3 power - law that extends to the lowest frequencies allowed by the data sampled .",
    "interestingly , the pe falls off much more rapidly with frequency than the ke .",
    "once again , like wavenumber space , the total energy shows a transition from a steep ( pe dominated ) to shallow ( ke dominated ) scaling at the  deformation frequency \" . in terms of frequency - wavenumber diagrams ,",
    "the energy is much more broadly distributed than in the jet forming cases .",
    "in fact , there is a predominance of westward moving disturbances whose frequency is always less than the corresponding frequency associated with turbulence .",
