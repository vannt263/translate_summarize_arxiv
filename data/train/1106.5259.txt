    "since the pioneering work of franck and teller  @xcite , exciton theory is widely used to describe the optical and energy transfer properties of light harvesting systems  @xcite . in recent years particular focus has been drawn to the so - called fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) complex ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) , that promotes energy transfer from the main light harvesting complex towards the reaction center in green sulfur bacteria  @xcite .",
    "the fmo complex consists of three identical subunits , called `` monomers '' , each containing eight @xcite bacteriochlorophyll ( bchl ) molecules ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fmo ] ) .",
    "the numbering of the bchls within the fmo monomer . in the present work bchl 8",
    "is not taken into account .",
    "the figure is created using pymol  @xcite . ]",
    "it is assumed that bchls  1 , 6 , and  8 are located at the baseplate and receive electronic excitation captured by the chlorosomes @xcite .",
    "bchls 3 and 4 are located in the vicinity of the reaction center . to understand the excitation transfer mechanisms , many experimental and theoretical investigations , that took advantage of the availability of high resolution crystal structure ,",
    "have been performed .",
    "supported by theoretical modeling a good overall understanding of the local energies of the chlorophyll molecules and their dipole - dipole couplings has been obtained , although there is still a large variance between values found in the literature @xcite .",
    "the present interest in the fmo complex has been greatly stimulated by the evidence for wavelike energy transfer through quantum coherence in photosynthetic systems @xcite .",
    "since the electronic coherences are strongly influenced by the coupling of electronic excitation to vibrational modes of the bchl molecules and by the coupling to the protein environment , a detailed modeling of this interaction is important .",
    "information on this coupling has been obtained e.g.  from fluorescence line narrowing @xcite or from theoretical simulations @xcite , which indicate that the spectral density , describing the coupling of the electronic excitation to vibrational modes , is quite structured .",
    "such a structured spectral density will lead to non - markovian effects .",
    "the influence of these non - markovian effects have been investigated by various theoretical methods @xcite . in general",
    "these methods are difficult to apply to large systems and/or arbitrary spectral densities .    in the present paper we present an efficient approach , which allows us to treat structured spectral densities with minimal requirements on the computer capabilities .",
    "all the calculations presented below can be performed on a standard pc within a few minutes .",
    "the method is based on the non - markovian quantum state diffusion ( nmqsd ) approach @xcite and allows us to treat the whole range from coherent wavelike motion to incoherent hopping .",
    "we have applied this method , within the zeroth order functional expansion ( zofe ) approximation , to describe the optical and transfer properties of molecular aggregates  @xcite . within the zofe approximation it is possible to derive a non - markovian master equation @xcite , which we use in this paper ( in the following",
    "we will call it zofe master equation ) .",
    "this approach enables us to calculate the excitation dynamics of fairly large systems , e.g.  aggregates consisting of more than @xmath0 chromophores , taking structured spectral densities for the exciton - phonon coupling into account .",
    "although our method contains an approximation , from a previous study on absorption spectra of smaller complexes we expect that for parameters relevant for the fmo complex the approximation works well @xcite .",
    "this will be confirmed in the following , where we will compare excitation energy transfer , calculated using the zofe master equation , with results of the so - called hierarchical equations of motion ( heom ) approach .",
    "the heom approach has become popular @xcite , since it allows in principle converged results to be obtained .",
    "however , the numerical effort grows rapidly with increasing system size and for spectral densities that deviate from the drude - lorentz ( d - l ) form . to overcome these difficulties extensive parallelization ( e.g.  by using graphics processing units @xcite ) is necessary .",
    "since in our method we are not restricted to a simple form of the spectral density , we can investigate how energy transfer depends on its details .",
    "in particular we show that the transfer dynamics is _ not _ sensitive to coupling to modes with energies above the largest energy difference between the purely electronic eigenstates of the fmo complex ( which is roughly @xmath1 ) .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that the transfer dynamics depends on the details of the local structure of the spectral density in the region , where the fmo complex has electronic transition energies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] we introduce the model used to describe the fmo complex and we present the zofe master equation that we use for the numerical calculations . in section [ sec : num_cal ] we first demonstrate that with the zofe master equation we are able to reproduce calculations obtained with the heom method",
    ". then we study the influence of different parts of the spectral density .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : summary ] we conclude with a summary and an outlook .",
    "in the following we will briefly introduce the model hamiltonian that we use to describe the fmo complex .",
    "further details can be found e.g.  in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in the equations below , we set @xmath2 . for each chromophore",
    "we take two electronic states into account .",
    "since we are interested in excitation transfer of a single electronic excitation , we restrict ourselves to the one - exciton subspace which is spanned by the states @xmath3 where chromophore @xmath4 is excited electronically and the other bchls are in their electronic ground state . in this basis",
    "the electronic `` system '' part of the fmo complex is @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the electronic energies of the chromophores and @xmath7 are the couplings between them .",
    "the `` environment '' of vibrational modes is taken in the form @xmath8 and the coupling of electronic excitation to these vibrations is expressed through @xmath9 here the @xmath10 , which describe the coupling of the electronic excitation on bchl @xmath4 to the local vibrational mode @xmath11 at this chromophore , are related to the spectral density @xmath12 by @xcite @xmath13 which will be taken as a continuous function in the following . for a thermal initial state @xmath14 of the environment",
    "the environment correlation function @xmath15 is related to the spectral density by the standard expression @xmath16\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that we assume that the local environments of different chromophores are uncorrelated , which is in accordance with recent calculations @xcite .",
    "finally the total hamiltonian in the one - exciton space is given by @xmath17    in the following we consider electronic excitation transfer .",
    "thus we will focus on the reduced density operator @xmath18 in the electronic subspace , which is the trace of the total density operator @xmath19 of system and environment over the vibrations @xmath20 its diagonal elements in the @xmath21 basis describe the time - dependent populations of the chromophores .",
    "we calculate the reduced density operator by applying a recently developed method , which is based on the non - markovian quantum state diffusion approach  @xcite . within the zofe approximation ( described in detail in ref .",

    "@xcite where the subscript 0 indicates that the operators are obtained from the zofe approximation ) . for the numerical implementation , we approximate the environment correlation function as a sum of exponentials , i.e.  @xmath26 with in general complex prefactors @xmath27 and complex frequencies @xmath28 .",

    "we expand the equations above in the @xmath21 basis . to determine the @xmath28 we proceed similarly as in ref .",
    "however , in the present work we do not use the matsubara decomposition for the @xmath32 appearing in the correlation function @xmath33 ( see eq .",
    "( [ bathcorrfunc ] ) ) but use the partial fraction decomposition proposed by croy and saalmann @xcite .",
    "the latter has superior convergence properties and uses poles in the complex plane ( not only on the imaginary axis , as is the case for the matsubara decomposition ) . since in the present approach",
    "one can use hundreds of exponentials , in principle it is no problem to approximate the environment correlation function @xmath34 for arbitrary spectral densities @xmath12 and temperatures with high accuracy .",
    "first we will compare the energy transfer calculated with the zofe master equation approach with the heom results of ref .",

    "since the zofe method enables us to consider an almost arbitrary form of the spectral density , we can now investigate the influence of different contributions to the spectral density .",
    "often , the so - called reorganization energy @xmath41 is used as a global measure for the coupling strength to the ( environmental ) vibrational modes depending on the spectral density @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "then strong coupling ( compared to the electronic interactions @xmath7 ) is identified as @xmath42 and weak coupling as @xmath43 .    in the following",
    "we will investigate the influence of contributions to the spectral density in different energy regions and we will show that in many cases the reorganization energy is not a reasonable measure for the coupling strength .",
    "first let us consider the influence of the high energy part of the spectral density .",
    "as an example we consider a spectral density ( dotted curve in fig .  [ fig : spec_dens](a ) ) , which coincides with the d - l spectral density of ref .",
    "@xcite for low energies , but has a large additional peak centered at about @xmath39 , resulting in strong additional coupling to high energy modes .",
    "we have calculated the transfer through the fmo monomer for this modified spectral density using the zofe master equation .",
    "the resulting transfer is exactly the same as that calculated by the zofe method for the original spectral density of ref .",
    "@xcite shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : transf_vs_ish_flem ] .",
    "this shows that despite contributing significantly to the reorganization energy , the high energy part above @xmath38 ( up to @xmath38 the spectral densities are the same ) is of no relevance for the system dynamics .",
    "the reason for that lies in the fact that the system energies , i.e.  all the transition energies between the electronic eigenenergies of the fmo monomer ( indicated by the vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_dens ] ) , are in the energy region below @xmath38 .",
    "that means that the detuning between these system energies and the high energy part of the spectral density is so large ( compared to the coupling strength ) that the high energy modes do not couple to the system .",
    "however , the reorganization energy does not take this fact into account and thus gives in this case a wrong indication for the strength of the coupling to the modes .    similarly , a faster drop - off , as given by the spectral density shown by the curve ( triangles ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_dens](a ) , does not affect the transfer dynamics , since in the region below @xmath38 it also agrees with the original spectral density .",
    "the spectral densities we considered so far have a smooth form without any prominent structure .",
    "however , a more realistic spectral density consists of several distinct peaks , that embody the strong coupling to the intra - molecular modes of the bchls , and is taken e.g.  from measured fluorescence line narrowing spectra  @xcite or from atomistic simulations ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the following",
    "we will investigate the influence of such a structured spectral density and the influence of how the coupling strength is shared among the peaks at different energies . to this end",
    "we consider a spectral density consisting of four distinct peaks .",
    "to obtain information about the importance of the individual peaks we vary their height in a range of parameters where from previous investigations  @xcite we are confident that the zofe approximation gives reliable results .    to distinguish the influence of the structure from that of the overall coupling strength , we want to roughly keep the total coupling strength in the relevant energy region ( below @xmath44 ) constant .",
    "to this end we first introduce an effective reorganization energy @xmath45 where we take @xmath46 and @xmath47 as the relevant energy range , that contains all electronic transition energies of the fmo monomer ( see the vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_dens ] ) over all huang - rhys factors @xmath48 of the modes in this energy region . however , this integral does not converge for the special form of the considered d - l spectral density when @xmath46 is taken . ] .    for the d - l spectral density in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_dens](a ) we get a value of @xmath49 for the effective reorganization energy .    to investigate the influence of the structure of the spectral density , we consider three different spectral densities , that all have the same effective reorganization energy as the d - l spectral density .",
    "but in contrast to the d - l spectral density , these spectral densities consist of four prominent peaks , whose intensities are varied .",
    "these spectral densities are shown as the solid curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_dens](b)(d ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_dens](b ) to ( d ) , one of the peaks at a time is enhanced . for comparison",
    "again the d - l spectral density is shown in each figure as the dotted curve .",
    "note , that due to the division by @xmath50 in the definition of the reorganization energy ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : eff_reorg_energ ] ) ) , to keep the value of @xmath40 constant , the peak intensity of the high - energy peaks becomes much larger than that of the low - energy peaks , when they are enhanced .    to investigate the influence of these changes in the spectral density",
    ", we calculated the excitation transfer through the fmo monomer using the zofe master equation .",
    "the resulting time - dependent excitation probabilities are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : transf_structured_spd ] in the same way as in fig .",
    "[ fig : transf_vs_ish_flem ] , but now for the three different spectral densities of fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_dens](b)(d ) and the d - l spectral density .     influence of the structure of the spectral density : transfer calculated with zofe master equation , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : transf_vs_ish_flem ] , but for the three different spectral densities in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_dens](b)(d ) and the d - l spectral density in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_dens](a ) . ]",
    "one sees that even though the overall coupling strength in the relevant energy region is kept constant , the transfer changes clearly when the structure of the spectral density is varied . in fig .",
    "[ fig : transf_structured_spd](a ) for instance , the population on bchl  3 after @xmath51 changes almost by up to 50% depending on the structure of the spectral density .",
    "obviously , not only the overall coupling strength in the relevant energy region is important , but also the local distribution of the coupling strength .    when the temperature is increased ( lower panels ) , the spreading of the curves decreases , showing that the structure of the spectral density becomes less important at higher temperatures",
    "in the present paper we have discussed excitation energy transfer in the fmo complex , emphasizing the role of the coupling of the excitation to vibrational modes of the bchl molecules .",
    "[ [ zofe - master - equation ] ] zofe master equation : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    to handle the coupling of the electronic excitation to vibrational modes the numerical calculations have been performed using the zofe master equation , utilizing the zofe approximation , which allows to calculate the transport for the fmo complex within a few minutes on a standard pc .",
    "we validated the applicability of the zofe approximation by comparing with the exact heom results of ref .",
    "@xcite , where a drude - lorentz spectral density has been used .",
    "[ [ reorganization - energy ] ] reorganization energy : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    since we are not restricted to a certain spectral density ( sd ) , we investigated the influence of the parts of the sd in different energy regions . as expected , the high energy part of the sd ( above @xmath52 @xmath53 ) does not influence the transport properties . in this context",
    "it is worth noting that the so - called reorganization energy , which is often used as a measure for the strength of the coupling to the environment , is often not a reasonable measure , since it takes into account the sd at all energies . in particular sds ,",
    "that have the same reorganization energy but , in the relevant energy region , have different shapes , affect the system dynamics differently .",
    "[ [ structured - spectral - density ] ] structured spectral density : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    being aware of this we used an `` effective reorganization energy '' ( ere ) , which is a local measure in the energy region of system transitions  , to investigate the dependence of the transfer on the local structure of the sd .",
    "we find that even when the structure is changed only slightly and the ere is kept constant , we observe a change in the transfer to bchl 3 up to 50% .",
    "this influence of the structure of the sd decreases when temperature is increased .",
    "[ [ electronic - energies - and - couplings ] ] electronic energies and couplings : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    note that the transfer of course depends also strongly on the precise values of the electronic couplings @xmath7 between the bchls and their transition energies .",
    "for example we found that the final population of bchl 3 increases by roughly 50% when the electronic couplings are increased by 25% .",
    "thus care has to be taken not to overestimate theoretical results obtained for a certain set of parameters .",
    "[ [ outlook ] ] outlook : + + + + + + + +    since measured spectral densities show many peaks in the energy region where electronic transition energies are located @xcite , in further work the interplay between the electronic hamiltonian and highly structured sds should be studied in more detail .    for such systematic studies",
    "the nmqsd ( and accordingly the zofe master equation derived from it ) seems to be well suited , due to the short calculation times .",
    "another big advantage of the computational efficiency of the approach is that larger systems are tractable now  the full trimer with 24 chromophores and a structured sd can be calculated on a standard pc within a few hours .",
    "one goal of the present study was to further investigate the rather abstract zofe approximation @xcite .",
    "the quite good agreement with the exact heom results of ref .",
    "@xcite makes us confident that it is worth to further explore the nmqsd method .",
    "the nmqsd approach is also suitable to describe other light harvesting complexes and molecular aggregates . while in the case of the fmo complex the coupling to high energy vibrational modes with energies larger than @xmath54 does not influence the energy transfer markedly , in molecular aggregates of organic dyes these modes have a strong impact on the electronic excitation dynamics @xcite .",
    "furthermore they have energies comparable to the dipole - dipole interaction which influences strongly e.g.   the aggregate absorption spectra @xcite . in previous investigations we have found that typical features of molecular aggregate spectra , such as the exchange narrowing of the j - band and the broad h - band , are reproduced by the nmqsd calculations @xcite .",
    "the nmqsd method is also readily applicable to treat optical spectroscopy . in particular it should be well suited to investigate the influence of the coupling to vibrational modes on the signals observed in 2d experiments",
    "such a study might be revealing , since the `` power spectrum '' obtained from 2d measurements in ref .",
