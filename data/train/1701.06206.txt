    "active probing with electromagnetic radiation is used in many practical systems to measure physical properties of objects .",
    "however , there are scenarios where the detection of such probing by an unauthorized third party ( which could be the target object ) is undesired . in these scenarios",
    "covert , or low probability of intercept / detection ( lpi / lpd ) , signaling must be used .",
    "while covertness is often required by practical stand - off sensing systems , the fundamental limits of sensing under the covertness constraints has been relatively under - explored .",
    "recently , the fundamental limits of covert communication have been characterized for several classical and quantum channels .",
    "covert communication is governed by the _ square root law _ ( srl ) : @xmath4 bits can be reliably transmitted in @xmath1 channel uses without being detected by the adversary ; transmission of more bits results in either detection or uncorrectable decoding errors .",
    "the srl was first proven for the classical wireless channels subject to the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) @xcite , with follow - on works extending this result to discrete memoryless channels ( dmcs ) and fully characterizing the constant hidden by the big-@xmath5 notation @xcite .",
    "now consider the lossy thermal - noise bosonic channel , which is the quantum - mechanical model for optical communication .",
    "the srl also governs covert communication over this channel : provided that there exists a noise source that the adversary does not control ( for example , the unavoidable thermal noise from blackbody radiation at the operating temperature and wavelength ) , @xmath4 covert bits can be reliably transmitted using @xmath1 orthogonal spatio - temporal polarization modes . as in the srl for awgn channel , transmission of more bits results in either detection or uncorrectable decoding errors @xcite . remarkably , the srl is achievable using standard optical communication components ( laser light modulation and homodyne receiver ) even when the adversary has access to all the photons that are not captured by the legitimate receiver , as well as arbitrary quantum measurement , storage and computing capabilities .",
    "conversely , entangled photon transmissions , as well as arbitrary quantum measurement , storage and computing capabilities do not permit one to reliably transmit more covert bits than the srl allows , even when the adversary has access to only a fraction of the transmitted photons and is only equipped with a noisy photon counting receiver .    a covert communications adversary has to decide whether or not a transmission takes place .",
    "thus , the transmitter has to render the adversary s detector ineffective by ensuring that it can only do a little better than a random decision .",
    "the srl for covert communications arises because , for this to happen , the average symbol power @xmath6 must scale in the blocklength @xmath1 as @xmath7 . in the awgn setting , @xmath6 is the average squared symbol magnitude , while in the bosonic channel setting it is the mean photon number per mode . by standard arguments , the total number of reliably transmissible bits thus scales as @xmath8 .",
    "since @xmath9 , the covert communication channel capacity is zero , however , a non - trivial number of bits can be transmitted when @xmath1 is large ( see a tutorial survey in @xcite ) .    the results for the fundamental limits of covert communication over lossy thermal - noise bosonic channel in @xcite",
    "motivate our investigation of the fundamental limits of covert sensing .",
    "we begin by noting that the most effective method of staying covert is passive imaging , which emits no energy .",
    "passive imaging collects the scattered light from a naturally - illuminated ( or self - luminous ) scene .",
    "however , this can be impractical , or even impossible , in many scenarios .",
    "for example , the scene could be hidden from direct line of sight or the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) at the receiver could otherwise be insufficient to obtain the desired performance . in these situations ,",
    "active transmitters must be employed to illuminate the target .",
    "-mode probe is corrupted by a lossy thermal - noise bosonic channel with transmissivity @xmath10 and thermal background mean photon number @xmath11 per mode .",
    "fraction @xmath12 of the photons is lost and can be captured by the adversary , while the remaining fraction @xmath10 of the photons is received by the sensor after the probe acquires unknown phase @xmath0 in each mode .",
    "an estimate @xmath2 is computed from the measurement of the received probe state and the reference state ( which adversary can not access ) .",
    "the input - output relationship of the bosonic channel is captured by a beamsplitter of transmissivity @xmath10 , with the sensor s transmitter at one of the input ports and the phase rotation followed by the sensor s receiver at one of the output ports .",
    "the other input and output ports of the beamsplitter correspond to the environment and the adversary . switching the order of the phase rotation and the bosonic channel does not affect phase estimation (",
    "[ fig : setup ] ]    we therefore study the fundamental limits of quantum - secure covert active sensing .",
    "this notion of security is more stringent than , for example , ensuring that the return probes are not spoofed by the target as done in @xcite ( undetectable probes can not be spoofed ) .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ fig : setup ] , we explore covert estimation of an unknown phase @xmath0 of a single pixel using an optical probe that passes through a lossy thermal - noise bosonic channel with transmissivity @xmath10 and thermal background mean photon number @xmath11 per mode .",
    "adversary captures up to @xmath12 fraction of light from the probe .",
    "we assume that the distance to the target pixel is known .",
    "the focus on estimating the unknown phase allows us to leverage the extensive literature in quantum metrology ( see @xcite for a recent survey ) ; however , we believe that similar results hold in other sensing modalities ( such as ranging , reflectometry , target detection , and target classification ) .",
    "ensuring covertness of transmitted probes imposes the same power constraint @xmath7 photons / mode as in communications .",
    "we thus find that covert sensing is subject to its own srl :    suppose the sensor attempts to estimate an unknown phase @xmath0 of a pixel using an @xmath1-mode optical probe that passes through a lossy thermal - noise bosonic channel , as described in figure [ fig : setup ] .",
    "also suppose that the adversary has access to fraction @xmath12 of the transmitted photons .",
    "then the sensor can achieve mean squared error ( mse ) @xmath13 while ensuring the ineffectiveness of the adversary s detector . attempting to decrease scaling for mse results in detection of the interrogation attempt with high probability .",
    "in addition to the scaling law above , we characterize the constants hidden by the big-@xmath5 notation for several covert estimation schemes .",
    "we find that using laser pulse modulation and heterodyne receiver yields mse that is at most twice that of the laser light modulation coupled with the optimal receiver , and a factor @xmath14 greater than the ultimate lower bound .",
    "this limit on enhancing the design coupled with the constraint on the power per mode imposed by the covertness requirement implies that only increasing the number of available orthogonal modes @xmath1 can improve the performance of covert sensing systems .    after introducing the channel model and the background on our performance metrics in the next section , we prove the square root law for covert sensing of phase in section [ sec : proof ] .",
    "we then conclude with a discussion of future work in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "consider a single - mode lossy bosonic channel @xmath15 with path transmissivity @xmath16 and thermal noise mean photon number @xmath17 , as depicted in figure [ fig : setup ] .",
    "the sensor ( an optical interferometer ) interrogates the target using an @xmath1-mode probe with average photon number @xmath6 per mode , where @xmath12 fraction of these photons is lost to the adversary , while the remaining fraction @xmath10 returns to the sensor after acquiring the unknown phase @xmath0 on each mode",
    ". the sensor estimates @xmath0 using the collected light and retained state ( e.g. , a local oscillator for a coherent detector ) , and outputs estimate @xmath2 .",
    "the sensor has to minimize the mse of the estimate @xmath18 while preventing the detection of the probe by the adversary .",
    "the quantum cramer - rao lower bound ( qcrlb ) for the mse of the estimate is @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the quantum fisher information ( qfi ) associated with the @xmath1-mode probe state that acquires phase @xmath0 on each mode .",
    "if @xmath1-mode probe state is a tensor product of @xmath1 identical probe states , each of which acquires phase @xmath0 independently , then @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the qfi associated with each probe state .",
    "the adversary performs a binary hypothesis test on his sample to determine whether the target is being interrogated or not .",
    "performance of the hypothesis test is typically measured by its detection error probability @xmath23 , where equal prior probabilities on sensor s interrogation state are assumed , @xmath24 is the probability of false alarm and @xmath25 is the probability of missed detection .",
    "the sensor desires to remain covert by ensuring that @xmath26 for an arbitrary small @xmath27 regardless of adversary s measurement choice ( since @xmath28 for a random guess ) . by decreasing the power used in a probe",
    ", the sensor can decrease the effectiveness of the adversary s hypothesis test at the expense of the increased mse of the estimate .",
    "we begin by demonstrating in section  [ sec : converse ] that , no matter how one designs the transmitted probe and the measurement ( which may include arbitrarily - complicated entangled transmitted states and quantum - limited joint - detection measurements over @xmath1 modes ) , the mse can not decay any faster than @xmath29 without the probe being detected by the adversary .",
    "next , we establish the achievability of the srl for covert phase sensing in section  [ sec : achievability ] , where we show that one can attain mse @xmath13 using laser light illumination and coherent detection . finally , we argue for this scheme s near - optimality .      here",
    "we show that the srl for covert phase sensing is insurmountable .",
    "we denote the mean total photon number of the probe sent to the sensing arm using @xmath1 modes by @xmath30 and the total photon number variance by @xmath31 . just as in (",
    "* theorem 5 ) , we restrict the sensor to using @xmath1-mode probes with total photon number variance @xmath32 . however , this restriction is not onerous , as it subsumes all well - known quantum states of bosonic mode .",
    "we employ the asymptotic notation ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.1 ) where @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote asymptotically tight and not tight lower bounds on @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "[ th : converse ] suppose the target is interrogated using an @xmath1-mode probe with a total of @xmath30 photons , and that the total photon number variance of the probe is @xmath32 .",
    "then , the sensing attempt is either detected by the adversary with arbitrarily low detection error probability , or the estimator has mean squared error @xmath36 .",
    "suppose the optical interferometer depicted in figure [ fig : setup ] uses a general pure state @xmath37 , where @xmath1 modes are used in both the probe and the reference systems .",
    "denoting by @xmath38 the set of all non - negative integers , and by @xmath39 a tensor product of @xmath1 fock states , the quantum state of the combined ( and potentially entangled ) probe and reference states is formally defined as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 .",
    "the state in each system is obtained by tracing out the other , for example , the probe that is used to interrogate the target is @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , the mean total photon number in the probe is @xmath43 and the total photon number variance is @xmath44 .",
    "provided that the adversary captures a fraction @xmath45 of the transmitted photons , where @xmath46 , in appendix [ app : pe_w_ub ] we show that the interrogation attempt is detected with arbitrarily low error probability if @xmath47 . to detect the sensor ,",
    "the adversary uses a standard threshold test on the total photon count output by a noisy photon number resolving detector .",
    "when an @xmath1-mode probe passes through a lossy thermal - noise bosonic channel and acquires phase @xmath0 on each mode , we have an upper bound @xmath48 , where @xcite @xmath49 with @xmath50 the sensor must use an @xmath1-mode probe with @xmath51 photons to avoid detection , which implies that , by the qcrlb in , the mse for any estimator of @xmath0 is @xmath52 .",
    "we now prove that the srl for covert sensing is achievable even when the adversary s capabilities are limited only by the laws of quantum mechanics .",
    "that is , we allow the adversary to collect all the transmitted photons that do not return to the sensor , perform quantum - limited joint - detection measurements over @xmath1 modes , and use arbitrary quantum computing and storage resources .",
    "[ th : achievability ] suppose the sensor attempts to estimate an unknown phase @xmath0 of a pixel using an optical probe that passes through a lossy thermal - noise bosonic channel , as described in figure [ fig : setup ] .",
    "also suppose the adversary can perform an arbitrarily complex receiver measurement as permitted by the laws of quantum physics and capture all the transmitted photons that do not return to the sensor .",
    "then the sensor can lower - bound adversary s detection error probability @xmath53 for any @xmath27 while achieving the mse @xmath13 using an @xmath1-mode probe .",

    "[ app : receiver ] we show that the use of an ideal heterodyne receiver achieves the mse @xmath62 where the constant @xmath63 is @xmath64 practical heterodyne detectors operate close to the ideal limit , which implies @xmath65 .",

    "since the constant @xmath63 attainable using a coherent state probe and heterodyne detection is only twice that of the best attainable constant for a tmsv probe @xmath77 , the challenges associated with using squeezed states may not be worth it .",
    "in fact , we can use the bound on the qfi for an arbitrary @xmath1-mode state to derive the ultimate limit for the mse of phase sensing over the lossy thermal - noise bosonic channel .",
    "since is increasing in the total photon number variance @xmath78 , we can upper - bound the qfi as @xmath79 where @xmath80 by , and the substitution of in ( where we note that @xmath81 ) , we have @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is approximated by discarding the low - order terms as @xmath84 therefore , the mse attainable using a practical sensing scheme is at most @xmath14 times the ultimate lower bound .",
    "section [ sec : limits ] shows that practically - attainable mse is a small constant factor above optimal . moreover , since covertness imposes a strict power constraint unlike in other sensing scenarios , here one can not decrease the mse by increasing power , the only degree of freedom in covert sensing ( and communication ) is @xmath1 , the number of available orthogonal modes .",
    "now , @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the number of orthogonal polarizations , @xmath87 is the number of orthogonal spatial modes ( governed by the channel geometry ) , and @xmath88 is the number of temporal modes ( time - bandwidth product ) with @xmath89 ( in seconds ) being the transmission time window and @xmath90 ( in hz ) being the total spectral bandwidth of the source ( see ( * ? ? ?",
