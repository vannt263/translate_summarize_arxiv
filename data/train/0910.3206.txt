    "the distribution of stars around a massive black hole ( henceforth mbh ) is a classical problem in stellar dynamics @xcite . the observational demonstration of the existence of nuclear stellar clusters ( henceforth nscs)as revealed by a clear upturn in central surface brigthness  in the centers of galaxies makes its study ever more timely .",
    "a number of nscs in coexistence with a central mbh have recently been detected @xcite suggesting that nscs around mbhs , like the one in the center of the milky way , may be quite common .",
    "the renewed interest in this theoretical problem is thus motivated by the observational data in nscs and , in particular , the very rich and detailed data available for the stars orbiting the galactic mbh . at the same time , the prospects for detection of gravitational waves ( gws ) from extreme mass ratio inspirals ( henceforth emris ) with future gw detectors such as the _ laser interferometer space antenna _ ( lisa ) also urge us to build a solid theoretical understanding of sub - parsec structure of galactic nuclei .",
    "in fact , emri rates will depend strongly on the stellar density of compact remnants as well as on the detailed physics within @xmath5(@xmath6pc ) of the hole , which is the region from which these inspiralling sources are expected to originate @xcite .",
    "@xcite have shown , through a kinetic treatment that , in the case all stars are of the same mass , this quasi - steady distribution takes the form of power laws , @xmath7 , in physical space and @xmath8 in energy space ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) .",
    "this is the so - called _ zero - flow solution _ for which the net flux of stars in energy space is precisely zero .",
    "@xcite and @xcite were the first to report @xmath0-body realizations of this solution , thereby validating the assumptions inherent to the fokker - planck ( fp ) approximation  namely , that scattering is dominated by uncorrelated , @xmath11-body encounters and , in particular , dense stellar cusps populated with stars of the _ same mass _ are robust against ejection of stars from the cusp .",
    "the properties of stellar systems that display a range of stellar masses are only very poorly reproduced by single mass models .",
    "it is well known from stellar dynamical theory that when several masses are present there is mass segregation  a process by which the heavy stars accumulate near the center while the lighter ones float outward @xcite .",
    "accordingly , stars with different mass get distributed with different density profiles . by assuming a stellar population with two mass components , @xcite  hencefort bw77generalized their early cusp solution and argued heuristically for a scaling relation @xmath12 that depends on the star s mass ratio only .",
    "however , they obtained no general result on the inner slope of the heavy objects ; nor did they discuss the dependence of the result on the component s number fractions . on the other hand ,",
    "it was shown long ago by @xcite that the presence of a mass spectrum leads to an increased rate of stellar ejections from the core of a globular cluster , but he did not include the presence of a mbh at the center .",
    "hnon s work raises the question as to whether _ multi - mass _ stellar cusps , obtained from the solution of the fp equation , are robust against ejection of stars from the cusp",
    ". ejections  due to strong encounters  are _ a priori _ excluded from the fp evolution , even though they could occur in a real nucleus . furthermore , even if cusps were shown by @xmath0-body results to be robust against stellar ejections ( and we show that they are in this letter ) , bw77 scaling can not be valid for arbitrary number fractions .",
    "recently @xcite  henceforth ah09stressed this latter point and have shown via fp calculations that , indeed , in the limit where the number fraction of heavy stars is realistically small , a new solution that they coined _ strong mass segregation _ obtains with density scaling as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 .",
    "they have shown that there are two branches for the solution parametrized by @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath16 branch , for @xmath17 corresponds to the scaling relations found by bw77 ; while the @xmath18 branch , for @xmath19 , generalizes the bw77 solution . there is a straightforward physical interpretation . in the limit where heavy stars are very scarce , they barely interact with each other and instead sink to the center due to dynamical friction against the sea of light stars .",
    "therefore , a quasi - steady state forms in which the heavy star s current is not nearly zero and thus the bw77 solution does not hold .",
    "as @xmath20 increases , self - scattering of heavies becomes important and the resulting quasi - steady state forms with a nearly zero current for stars of all masses , so bw77 solution is recovered .",
    "for all these reasons , it is fundamental to verify the bahcall - wolf solution  as well as its alexander - hopman generalization  with @xmath0-body integrations .",
    "there has been a surprisingly small number of @xmath0-body studies of multi - mass systems around a mbh @xcite , and none of them reported the occurence of strong mass segregation .    in this letter",
    "we use direct @xmath0-body integrations to show for the first time that : ( i ) strong mass segregation is a robust outcome of the growth of stellar cusps around a mbh when @xmath19 ; ( ii ) bw77 solution is recovered when @xmath17 ; ( iii ) as a corollary , we conclude that the rate of stellar ejections from the cusp is too low to destroy the high density cusps around mbhs  even though ejections from the cusp _ do _ occur .",
    "furthermore , having validated the fp formalism , we proceed to use it to estimate the time scales for cusp re - growth starting from a wider range of models .",
    "@xcite obtained , for milky way type nucleus , times in large excess of a hubble time .",
    "we use a fp formalism which , in contrast with that of the latter author , is tailored to follow the simultaneous evolution of the cusp of different stellar masses without any restrictions with respect to the values of @xmath21 or @xmath22 . with our fp solutions we show that , for @xmath23 , the times for re - growing stellar cusps are shorter than a hubble time .",
    "our results clearly suggest that strongly segregated stellar cusps around mbhs in this mass range may be quite common in nscs and should be taken into account when estimating emri event rates .",
    "we have performed the @xmath0-body simulations with a modified version of _ nbody4 _",
    "@xcite adapted to the @xmath24 special - purpose hardware .",
    "the code was modified to add the capture of stars by the mbh : stars that enter a critical radius @xmath25 from the hole are captured and their mass is added to the hole .",
    "the new position and velocity of the new massive particle are calculated by imposing that the capture process conserves total linear momentum .",
    "the maximum number of particles supported by the memory of a micro - grape board is @xmath26 , which have been shown to be sufficient to accurately describe the evolution of the bulk properties ( densities in physical and phase space ) of the nuclear stellar cluster @xcite , but is not enough to resolve its loss cone dynamics accurately .",
    "therefore , we do not attempt a detailed modelling of tidal disruption processes and set the capture radius to be equal for all particles .",
    "the mbh dominates the dynamics inside its influence radius @xmath27 defined to be the radius which encloses twice of its mass at @xmath28 .",
    "the stellar distribution evolves and reaches its asymptotic quasi - steady state over relaxation time scales @xcite : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are , respectively , the @xmath32 velocity dispersion and spatial density evaluated at @xmath27 .",
    "following @xcite , we define the coulomb logarithm @xmath33 .",
    "a realistic mass population of stars with a continuous range of stellar masses can be approximately represented by two ( well - separated ) mass scales : one in the range @xmath34 corresponding to low mass main - sequence stars , white dwarfs ( wds ) and neutron stars ( nss ) ; another with @xmath35 representing stellar black holes ( sbhs ) .",
    "the relative abundance of objects in these mass ranges is overwhelmingly dominated by the lighter stars  typical number ractions of sbhs being of @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the initial stellar model is built from a dehnen model of a spherical galaxy @xcite to which a massive particle is added at the center at rest @xcite .",
    "the positions and velocities are monte - carlo realizations that accurately reproduce the spatial @xmath22 and phase space @xmath21 densities with stars of the same mass . in order to generate a two - component model ,",
    "we proceed as follows : ( 1 ) we specify the mass ratio @xmath37 between heavy and light stars , and respective number fractions @xmath38 and @xmath39 , through which the ah09 @xmath20 parameter is fixed ; ( 2 ) we assign the mass @xmath40 or @xmath41 randomly to each star according to the statistical weights @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "the resulting model is almost in dynamical equilibrium ; deviations of virial ratio from unity are @xmath44 . on a dynamical time scale ,",
    "phase mixing occurs and the virial ratio converges to unity to within a fraction of a percent . following this prescription , the two - component models start without any mass segregation , as would be expected from a violently relaxed system .",
    "dehnen model s density has @xmath45 at the center and the corresponding distribution function @xmath21 is isotropic .",
    "table 1 gives the list of runs and adopted parameters .",
    "we also study the evolution of the nsc with a multi - mass fokker - planck formalism and compare results with the @xmath0-body integrations . the time - dependent , orbit - averaged , isotropic , fokker - planck equation in energy space is defined , for each component @xcite , by    @xmath46    @xmath47 ,   \\\\",
    "d_{e , i } & = & - \\sum_j^{n_c } \\left ( \\frac{\\mu_j}{\\mu_i } \\right ) \\int_e^{+\\infty } de ' p(e ' ) f_j(e').\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in this equation , @xmath48 run from @xmath49 to @xmath50 ( the number of mass components ) , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a reference mass .",
    "@xmath53 is the phase - space accessible to each ( bound ) star of specific energy @xmath54 @xcite , and the total gravitational potential @xmath55 is the sum of the contribution from the nuclear cluster plus the hole . during our simulations , the stellar distribution and its resulting gravitational potential change substantially inside @xmath27 only  the region",
    "over which the mbh s potential is dominant  so we keep the contribution from the stars to total @xmath55 fixed throughout .",
    "this system of fp equations treats self - consistently both dynamical friction and two - body scattering between all components , without any further approximations other than those inherent to the fp formalism .",
    "in contrast with @xcite , our treatment is not limited to early evolution where the heavy component is just a small perturbation on the ( time evolving and dominant in number ) light component . as a result",
    ", we can follow both weak and strong branches of the solution throughout without restriction .",
    "we solve the fp equations  ( [ fp - eqn1 ] , [ fp - eqn2 ] ) using the @xcite integration scheme .",
    "the density of stars around the mbh increases as the cusp grows for both light and heavy components until it reaches a quasi - steady state ; afterwards , the lights start to slowly expand .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ fig - enc - mass - vs - time ] , where the mass inside a sphere of @xmath56 , centered on the mbh , is depicted as a function of time .",
    "this distance is measured with respect to the _ instantaneous _ position of the mbh . both curves from fp and nb",
    "are shown together for three different runs with @xmath57 corresponding to strong segregation and @xmath58 to weak segregation branches .",
    "the time scaling between nb and fp is related through @xmath59 , and no further adjustements were made . in the three cases shown ( as in all others cases tested but not shown ) , the agreement between both methods is very good , although there is a noticeable tendency for the heavy particles in the nb runs to segregate more strongly in the central cusp  this is especially the case in the strong branch . figure  [ fig - enc - mass - vs - time ] also suggests that a quasi - steady state ( and maximum central concentration ) have been reached by the end of the runs corresponding to @xmath60 .",
    "we stress that mass segregation , whether in the weak or strong branch , speeds up cusp growth by factors ranging from @xmath61 to @xmath62 in comparison with the single - mass case @xcite .",
    "figure  [ nb - dens ] displays the spatial density profiles @xmath63 and @xmath64 at late times , @xmath65 .",
    "the agreement between both methods is again quite good although there is the tendency , in the strong branch , for nb s asymptotic slope @xmath66 to be slightly smaller than in fp  for which @xmath67 .",
    "the slopes of the inner density profiles of the heavy component decrease as the solution evolves from the strong to the weak branch when @xmath20 is increased , as expected . in the limit of @xmath68",
    ", @xmath69 tends to evolve to a quasi - steady state close to the @xmath70 solution , while for @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "the asymptotic inner density slopes , in both solution branches , of the light component extend out to @xmath73 ; in contrast , the heavy component shows a different behavior depending on the solution branch : on the weak branch , @xmath69 s asymptotic slope also extends only up to @xmath73 , while on the strong branch it extends virtually all the way to @xmath27 . in the strong branch ,",
    "the density of the heavy component exceeds that of the light for @xmath74 ( and will therefore dominate the interaction events with the mbh ) ; in the strong branch , @xmath75 throughout .",
    "although there are some differences in quantitative detail , these nb results broadly confirm the fp calculations and validate its inherent assumptions  at least in what concerns the description of the _ bulk _ properties of stellar distributions . a more detailed study and description of the stellar dynamics around a mbh under different initial conditions and different models ( allowing for more than the two components reported here ) , stellar ejections ( which _ do _ occur in the nb runs ) and captures , and further comparisons between nb and fp methods , are outside the scope of this letter and are the subject of another work in preparation .",
    "the analysis of the number counts of spectroscopically identified , old stars in the sub - parsec region of our own milky way believed to be complete down to magnitude @xmath76reveals a deficit of old stars with respect to the high number a strongly segregated cusp would entail .",
    "although the slope of the density profile is still weakly constrained , the best fits from number counts data seem to exclude with certainty slopes @xmath77 @xcite , and there could be a core with a stellar density decreasing towards the center , @xmath78 , although such a fit is only marginally better than one with @xmath79 .",
    "although we deem to be too early to conclude for the inexistence of a segregated cusp around @xmath80 , since the detectable stars ( essentially giants ) are still a small fraction of the stellar population as a whole , we next compute the time necessary for cusp growth if at some point a central core is carved in the stellar distribution .",
    "having validated the fp approach and its results we study equations  ( [ fp - eqn1 ] , [ fp - eqn2 ] ) , which are orders of magnitude faster to solve than nb integrations .",
    "we choose as initial condition a model with @xmath81 ( which is the minimum slope that allows an isotropic solution around a mbh ) , since the isotropization time  the time necessary for the establishment of this shallow cusp starting from a hole in the spatial distribution  is @xmath82 @xcite , and we are interested in the evolution over @xmath5(@xmath83 ) time scales .",
    "figure  [ fp - dens ] shows the evolving phase - space @xmath21 and spatial @xmath22 densities for both components ( @xmath84 and @xmath85 constitute our fiducial case ) .",
    "it can be seen that , by @xmath86 , cusps with @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( or @xmath89 and @xmath90 in phase space ) are fully developed ; a little earlier , at @xmath91 , the density cusp @xmath64 is already fully developed down to @xmath92 ( @xmath93 pc if scaled to the milky way nucleus ) .",
    "if there was some event carving a hole in the stellar distribution around @xmath80 more than @xmath94 gyr ago , then there was enough time for a very steep cusp of stellar bhs to have re - grown .",
    "the number fraction @xmath95 of sbhs is sensitive to the initial mass function ( imf ) of high mass stars .",
    "there are indications the imf in galactic nuclei is top - heavy @xcite so we adopt a range of values @xmath96 $ ] ; the mass distribution of sbhs is also weakly constrained so we follow @xcite in considering several mass ratios @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "figure  [ trlx ] shows the relaxation times at the influence radius for nuclei with mbh masses in the range of interest for lisa ; the straight line is a linear fit to the points .",
    "the shaded region corresponds to the range @xmath99 $ ] and represents the time stellar cusps take to grow starting from an isotropic core",
    ". the shaded region s width results from the distribution of values for @xmath100 and @xmath95 . in the ranges we adopted , increasing @xmath100 or @xmath95",
    "both have the effect of decreasing the time for cusp growth . at early times , sbhs essentially evolve under dynamical friction with characteristic time scale @xmath101 ; increasing @xmath95 leads to an increased rate of self - scattering between sbhs at late times .",
    "our results show that strong mass segregation is a _ robust _ outcome from the growth of stellar cusps around mbhs .",
    "we have used @xmath0-body integrations with two masses  light and heavy components representing main sequence stars and stellar bhs respectively , and compared the results with those obtained with the fp formalism . the broad agreement between both methods",
    "validates the fp description of the _ bulk _ properties of time - evolving stellar distribution around a mbh  and its underlying assumptions .",
    "the differences of quantitative detail are the subject of another work in preparation .    using the fp equation to study cusp growth under a variety of initial conditions purported to represent cored nuclei ,",
    "we have shown that the time scales associated with cusp re - growth are clearly shorter than a hubble time for nuclei with mbhs in the mass range @xmath23even though the relaxation time , as estimated for a single mass stellar distribution , exceeds a hubble time in the upper part of this mass range .",
    "therefore , our work strongly suggests that quasi - steady ",
    "strongly segregated stellar cusps may be common around mbhs with masses in this range .",
    "emris of compact remnants will be detectable by lisa precisely for mbhs in this mass range @xcite .",
    "estimates for event and detection rates by lisa costumarily assume that the stellar cusps are in steady state @xcite .",
    "but recent observations reveal a dearth of giants inside @xmath49 pc from @xmath80 and raise the possibility that cored nuclei are common  this scenario has been thoroughly explored by @xcite .",
    "our results strongly suggest that stellar cusps can re - grow in less than a hubble time .",
    "the existence of cored nuclei still remains plausible though  especially for nuclei with mbhs in the upper part of the mass range , since time scales are still quite long ( _ e.g. _ @xmath94 gyr in milky way type nuclei ) .",
    "however , since emri rates scale as @xmath3 , @xmath4 $ ] , and re - growth times are @xmath102 gyr for @xmath103 , we still expect that a substantial fraction of emri events will originate from segregated stellar cusps .",
    "finally , indirect observations alone will reveal whether there is a `` hidden '' cusp of old stars and their dark remnants around @xmath80 @xcite .",
