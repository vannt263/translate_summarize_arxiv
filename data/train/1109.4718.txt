    "the measurement of beauty production in @xmath2 collisions at hera provides a powerful tool for testing the proton structure and perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) .",
    "the dominant production process is boson - gluon fusion between the incoming virtual photon and a gluon in the proton .",
    "when the negative squared four momentum of virtual photon , @xmath3 , is large compared to the proton mass , the interaction is referred to as deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "different kinematic variables which are used to describe @xmath2 interactions at hera are : @xmath3 , the bjorken scaling variable , @xmath4 , and the inelasticity , @xmath5 .    in this analysis",
    "@xcite , beauty production in dis was studied using the semileptonic decays to electrons .",
    "the measurements are compared to a leading order plus parton shower monte carlo ( rapgap )  @xcite as well as qcd predictions at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , calculated using hvqdis program  @xcite .",
    "this program is based on the fixed - flavour - number scheme ( ffns ) , in which heavy flavours are generated dynamically in the hard subprocess .",
    "the analysis was performed with data taken by the zeus detector from 2004 to 2007 , when hera collided electrons or positrons with energy @xmath6 with protons of energy @xmath7 .",
    "the corresponding integrated luminosity is 363@xmath8 at centre - of - mass energy @xmath9 .",
    "standard cuts  @xcite were applied to select dis events in the range @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "electron candidates from semileptonic decays of @xmath0 quarks were selected from energy flow objects ( efos ) having a transverse momentum @xmath12 in the pseudorapidity range @xmath13 .",
    "electrons from identified photon conversions were rejected .",
    "the electron candidate was required to be associated to a jet with @xmath14 and @xmath15 > 2.5@xmath16 .",
    "for the identification of electrons from semileptonic @xmath0 decays , variables sensitive to electron identification as well as to semileptonic decays were used .",
    "electron identification uses the measurement of the specific energy loss , @xmath17 , in the central tracking detector , the ratio of the energy deposited in the calorimeter to the track momentum and the penetrating depth of the energy deposited in the calorimeter .",
    "ffig[13]r0.47     semileptonic decays were separated from background using @xmath18 , the relative transverse momentum component of the electron candidate relative to the direction of jet axis ; @xmath19 , the difference of the azimuthal angle between the electron direction and the missing transverse momentum vector ; and @xmath20 , the significance of the reconstructed decay length , where @xmath21 is defined as the distance in @xmath22-@xmath23 between the secondary vertex and the interaction point , projected onto the jet axis .",
    "the six variables were combined into one discriminating test - function variable using a likelihood hypothesis . for a given hypothesis of particle , @xmath24 , and source @xmath25 , the likelihood , @xmath26 ,",
    "is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the probability to observe particle @xmath24 from source @xmath25 with value @xmath29 of a discriminating variable .",
    "the particle hypotheses @xmath30 and the sources , @xmath25 , for electrons from semileptonic @xmath0 decays , electrons from other sources including semileptonic @xmath31 decays and fake electrons were considered . the test function @xmath32 was defined as @xmath33",
    "the @xmath34 denote the prior probabilities taken from monte carlo .",
    "the distribution of likelihood test function is shown in figure  [ fig : likel_fit ] .",
    "the distribution is fit using the expected distributions for beauty , other electrons and fake electrons to determine the fractions of events from each source .",
    "the fit range of the test function was restricted to @xmath35 .",
    "the fit provides a very good description of data .",
    "figure  [ fig : ctrlplots ] shows signal - enriched distributions ( @xmath36 ) for the variables in the likelihood - ratio test function , which are sensitive to the different origins of the electron candidates . all distributions are reasonably well described .",
    "the systematic uncertainties were calculated by varying the analysis procedure and then repeating the fit to the likelihood distributions  @xcite .",
    "different sources of systematic uncertainty include variation of the dis selection , likelihood variables , different background sources , jet energy scale , energy scales in the calorimeters and trigger correction .",
    "no single dominant contribution was observed and the quadratic sum of the systematic uncertainties was found to be of the same order as the statistical uncertainty .",
    "the total visible cross section and differential cross sections for @xmath0-quark production and the subsequent semileptonic decay to an electron with @xmath37 in the range @xmath38    ffig[12]r0.65     @xmath39 in dis events with @xmath10 and @xmath40 were measured .",
    "figure  [ fig : diffxsec ] shows differential cross sections as a function of @xmath41 and @xmath42 compared to the nlo qcd prediction and the rapgap mc scaled to the data .",
    "both the descriptions from the nlo qcd calculation as well as the scaled rapgap cross sections describe the data well .",
    "the beauty contribution to the proton structure function @xmath44 can be defined in terms of the inclusive double differential cross section as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath3 , @xmath45f_{2}^{b\\bar{b}}(x , q^{2})-y^{2}f_{l}^{b\\bar{b}}(x , q^{2})\\right ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the beauty contribution to the structure function @xmath47 .",
    "ffig[19]r0.55    the electron cross section , @xmath48 , measured in bins of @xmath4 and @xmath3 , was used to extract @xmath43 at a reference point in the @xmath4-@xmath3 plane using @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 were calculated using the hvqdis program .",
    "figure  [ fig : f2b ] shows @xmath43 as a function of @xmath3 for fixed values of @xmath4 .",
    "the results from this measurement have been compared with the previous measurements from the h1 and zeus collaborations .",
    "the different measurements are consistent with each other .",
    "also the results are compared to several nlo and nnlo qcd predictions  @xcite .",
    "the data are reasonably well described by the different theory predictions .",
    "a recent measurement of beauty production in dis at hera using decays into electrons was presented .",
    "a likelihood - ratio test function was used to identify the signal .",
    "the measured visible and differential cross sections are in agreement with the nlo qcd calculations .",
    "@xmath43 was extracted from the double differential cross sections as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath3 , and is in agreement with previous h1 and zeus measurements . for @xmath52 ,",
