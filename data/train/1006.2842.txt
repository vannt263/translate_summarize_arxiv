    "a reciprocal lattice vector ( rlv ) has the form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 are primitive translations of the reciprocal lattice .",
    "the integer `` indices '' @xmath3 were originally introduced as the miller indices , which are reciprocals of the intersection points ( in units of @xmath4 , etc . ) , of a crystal lattice plane with the axes along the primitive translation vectors @xmath5 of the direct lattice .",
    "the `` 4-index '' notation @xmath0 in a hexagonal crystal denotes an rlv with @xmath6 .",

    "this notation has long been used by crystallographers , dating back at least to fedorov in 1890@xcite .",
    "an extra miller index is natural in hexagonal symmetry , because , rather than two @xmath8-plane axes @xmath9 at 120@xmath10 , the three symmetrical axes @xmath11 , shown in fig .",

    "the plane of atoms intersects all three axes .",
    "the reciprocal intersection points @xmath12 are forced by trigonometry to obey the rule @xmath13 .",
    "the proof@xcite is hinted in fig . 1 .",
    "even before bragg scattering was observed and explained ( 1912 - 13 ) , the mathematical concept of a dual or reciprocal lattice was used@xcite .",
    "after 1912 , physicists recognized the rlv as an x - ray momentum transfer .",
    "the `` indices '' which label planes seem secondary unless we are specifically studying an atomic plane .",
    "the redundant index may seem only a nuisance .",
    "since the advantages of the 4-index notation are not always understood , it is common to omit the third index , as would be done in crystal systems which lack @xmath14 rotations .",
    "this note is written in the belief that , once the underlying idea is clearly understood , the four index notation is natural .",
    "it can be used to some advantage to label rlv s @xmath15 and also to label directions @xmath16 $ ] ( called `` zones '' when the direction perceived as the common axis of a family of planes ) in the direct lattice . however",
    ", the 4-index labeling of directions @xmath17 that emerges in my analysis makes a subtle improvement over the one in use in electron microscopy@xcite .",

    "it is conventional to have them point in the directions of primitive translations of the lattice .",

    "it is perhaps disconcerting that the unit vectors @xmath51 do not `` look like '' unit vectors in the 4-vector notation , but this is a consequence of overcompleteness .",

    "the six translations have their first three indices chosen by the rule , organize three integers chosen from @xmath54 and @xmath55 , in all ways such that they add to zero .",
    "because of the symmetrical mathematics , the scalar product ( _ e.g. _ @xmath56 ) in 4-vector form is simple but unconventional : @xmath57 this can easily be verified , and will be explained in sec .",
    "when one drops the redundant third index from the 4-index notation , the remaining indices express vectors in a non - orthogonal basis .",
    "there is perfectly good mathematics behind this , but it hides symmetry and simplicity . in a hexagonal system , these disadvantages are removed by the 4-index system . in systems of lower symmetry , where translation vectors are not at @xmath58 and @xmath41 to each other , such simplification is not available . in this section",

    "@xmath64 is the volume of the three - dimensional unit cell , @xmath65 .",
    "then we have the usual vector relations @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "these relations indicate that the basis sets @xmath68 and @xmath69 are bi - othogonal .",
    "it not always mentioned in texts that the primitive direct lattice vectors and the primitive rlv s are examples of the mathematical notion of bi - orthogonal basis vectors .",
    "the important property is completeness : any vector can be expressed as a unique linear combination @xmath70 .",
    "note that @xmath71 , where @xmath72 equals @xmath73 in hexagonal systems .",
    "the coefficients @xmath74 and @xmath75 are found by solving a @xmath76 linear system in @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "a nice aspect of bi - orthogonality is that it diagonalizes the @xmath76 system and gives simple formulas for the coefficients , namely @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "it is arbitrary which basis ( direct space or reciprocal ) is taken to be primary and which to be dual .",
    "thus , an arbitrary vector @xmath20 has an alternate representation , @xmath81 the coefficients are @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "the inner product @xmath46 of two vectors is not given simply by @xmath84 , but involves also the cross term @xmath85 .",
    "the simple formula is @xmath86 , where the row vector is expressed in the basis dual to the one chosen for the column vector .",
    "an equivalent formula is @xmath87 .",
    "a compact mathematical representation of these relations is given by the equation @xmath88 , or by the alternate equation @xmath89 . here",

    "if written as a 2-component column vector , the basis should either be orthonormal , or if non - orthonormal , one has to be careful to use the direct and dual basis for the column vector @xmath44 and the row vector @xmath45 . in dyad notation ,",
    "the relations are @xmath91 this formula is called `` the completeness relation '' or , equivalently , `` the decomposition of unity . ''",
    "although this gives elegant formulas for inner products in non - orthogonal basis sets , these formulas are not likely to be used unless the vectors @xmath92 and @xmath20 belong separately , one to direct , and the other to reciprocal space .",
    "then the formulas are obvious .",
    "one has no trouble realizing that @xmath93 is equal to @xmath94 .",
    "for two dimensional vectors , or the @xmath8-plane components of 3-d vectors of an hexagonal crystal , the overcomplete symmetrical basis is the three vectors @xmath95 which lie at @xmath41 to each other , as shown in fig.[fig : hex ] .",
    "the key relationship is the dyad formula @xmath96 this decomposition of unity is a very nice alternative to eq.([eq : unityaa ] ) .",
    "it is no longer necessary to have dual sets of direct and reciprocal lattice vectors .",
    "the three vectors @xmath97 are self - dual . the scalar product of any two 2-vectors can be written as @xmath98 this formula can be written in an overcomplete 3-vector notation as @xmath99 where the usual array multiplication rule is obeyed .",
    "unlike the case of the biorthogonal basis , here there is no need for care about whether @xmath92 or @xmath20 is in direct or reciprocal space , or whether the primary or the dual basis is implied .",
    "the formula works for any two vectors .",
    "it is worth emphasizing one subtlety . in the bi - orthogonal basis ,",
    "when a column vector has indices @xmath100 $ ] , this means that @xmath70 , even though @xmath101 .",

    "the actual answer is @xmath107 .",
    "this follows immediately from eq.([eq : unity3e ] ) . it does not matter whether the vector @xmath20 is in direct space and indexed as @xmath108 $ ] or in reciprocal space and indexed as @xmath109",
    "now let us express the reciprocal lattice vectors in the overcomplete symmetric notation .",
    "first , recall that since @xmath110 , we have @xmath111 .",

    "they involve different coordinate systems and rules , yet the former derives from the latter by just dropping the extra third index , and the latter from the former by adding an index which is the negative sum of the first two indices .",
    "the additional advantages of the extra index representation are that it is completely explicit ( if @xmath119 is included , the vector is completely specified ) , and there is no ambiguity about the direct versus dual parts of the bi - orthogonal representation .",
