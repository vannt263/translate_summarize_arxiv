    "for centuries , the formation of well - defined patterns in plants , such as the orientation and shape of leaves , their venation patterns , the spatial distribution of hairs and stomata , the early embryonic development patterns and the branching patterns in both root systems and treetops , has intrigued many scientists .",
    "experimental research has identified a number of molecular components that play a major role in several of these pattern formation processes .",
    "one of them is the plant hormone auxin , and more specifically the auxin molecule indol-3-acetic acid ( iaa ) .",
    "experiments have shown that the active directional transport , which leads to accumulation spots of the auxin hormone , plays a central part in the pattern formation @xcite .",
    "based on such experimental evidence , reinhardt  _ et  al .",
    "_ developed a conceptual model that describes the auxin transport through the cells @xcite .",
    "smith and collaborators then constructed a computational simulation model @xcite incorporating the experimental evidence that the transport of the auxin molecule iaa is driven by a pumping mechanism that is mediated by pin1 proteins located at the cell membrane in addition to diffusion @xcite .",
    "therefore , smith and collaborators modeled the transport of the iaa hormone through the cells by describing the simultaneous evolution of the pin1 protein and the iaa hormone concentrations over time .",
    "also other computational models were developed based on these molecular mechanisms identified by reinhardt  _ et  al._. for instance jnsson _",
    "proposed a phyllotaxis model based on the polarized auxin transport @xcite .",
    "they analyzed a simplified version of their model that assumes an equal and constant pin1 concentration in every cell and membrane . in their simulations",
    "they used a linear row of uniform cells with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the results show that the spacing and the number of peaks in this simplified model depends on the different parameters .",
    "jnsson and collaborators also performed a stability analysis and found an analytical expression for the eigenvalues , belonging to a solution pattern with equal auxin concentrations .",
    "the eigenvalues are all real and a function of the model parameters of the model .",
    "they also identified the parameter threshold where the largest eigenvalue becomes unstable . beyond this threshold",
    ", all stable solutions will contain auxin peaks .",
    "this paper expands the study of the steady states in the transport of hormones .",
    "we limit ourselves to the study of the auxin distribution in a linear row of uniform cells that represents , for example , a cross section through a young leaf .",
    "we perform a thorough mathematical exploration of the behavior of the models and how their equations are solved starting from the basic coupled model of @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the analysis of jnsson  _ et  al . _ on a row of cells with fixed concentration of pin1 , we will use a coupled model where the pin1 concentration is allowed to change from cell to cell .",
    "the analysis gives new insights into the spacing of auxin accumulations that form the basis of vascular development @xcite .",
    "the patterns that emerge in a dynamical system are often studied mathematically through a bifurcation analysis .",
    "it relates the stability of the patterns to the parameters that occur in the systems description .",
    "the transitions where the patterns lose their stability are bifurcation points . for an overview of the bifurcation analysis of patterns we refer to the book @xcite .",
    "the main contribution of the paper is a systematic numerical bifurcation analysis for the coupled model of @xcite describing the transport of auxin .",
    "the analysis identifies two generic bifurcation scenarios that reappear for various choices of the parameters of the problem . through",
    "the bifurcation diagrams we identify the genesis of the patterns that were observed by smith and collaborators .",
    "furthermore , we have found a limited parameter range that allows periodic solutions in the system . in these solutions ,",
    "the concentration of auxin of each cell varies periodically over time . to the knowledge of the authors these results",
    "have not appeared in the literature .",
    "we present our work as follows . in section [ subsec : descriptionofthemathematicalmodel ] the basic cell polarization and auxin transport model of @xcite , where pin1 is allowed to change , is reconstructed .",
    "we also introduce a slightly generalized version of the active transport equation of this model . in the next section ,",
    "a specific model that will be used in the simulations is defined . in @xcite",
    "the domain roughly correlates to a ring of cells around an axial plant organ . in subsequent situations",
    "we consider a linear row of cells running from the margin to the midvein of the leaf and we consider zero fluxes at the boundary of the leaf .",
    "we will describe this by using homogeneous neumann boundary conditions instead of periodic boundary conditions which is explained in section [ subsec : thedomainitsboundaryconditionsandtheparameters ] . also in this section we look at the different parameter values . similar to smith _ et al .",
    "_ , we use time integration to solve the coupled equations of smith _ et al . _ in section [ subsec : timeintegration ] . since we are only interested in the steady state solutions , we define in section [ subsec : steadystateproblem ] , the corresponding steady state systems of the slightly different equations . for these steady state models , we define in section [ sec : thetrivialsolution ] a trivial solution and its stability properties .",
    "the stability is dependent on the model parameters and we examine for which parameter regions the trivial solution is stable . section [ sec : methods ] contains the techniques that will be used to solve the models . in particular , we will discuss bifurcation analysis ( [ subsec : bifurcationanalysis ] ) and continuation methods ( [ subsec : continuationmethods ] ) .",
    "bifurcation analysis reveals the relation between the stability of a solution and the model parameters and continuation methods calculates approximate solutions in function of a model parameter . in section [ sec : results ] we show the results of our simulations .",
    "in section [ sec : conclusionanddiscussion ] we conclude and give an outlook .      before constructing a compartmental model that describes the concentration of growth hormones per cell and its transport through a plant organ such as for example a leaf",
    ", its geometry must be specified .",
    "the domain in this work is a regular one dimensional row of cells , as in figure [ fig : domain ] .",
    "each cell is labeled and the set of cells is denoted with @xmath0 . therefore , for every cell in @xmath0 , we can define the neighboring cells , a subset of @xmath0 .",
    "for example , @xmath1 is the set of neighboring cells of cell @xmath2 .",
    "further every cell consists of a number of cell walls .",
    "the length of a cell wall between cell @xmath2 and cell @xmath3 is denoted with @xmath4 .",
    "the one dimensional domain in figure [ fig : domain ] represents the 1d geometry of a group of cells in a part of a plant organ at a certain moment in time .",
    "in advanced models this geometry changes over time because cell walls grow and cells divide @xcite , but in this paper we look at the basic , coupled cell polarization and auxin transport model of smith _ et al . _ and",
    "the geometry is assumed to be static . as a consequence",
    "the row of cells is fixed .",
    "the length of the cell wall is taken to be the length unit . as a result",
    "the volume of a cell also is the unit volume .     to @xmath5 . ]      for this geometry it is now possible to formulate a model for the transport of the growth hormones through the cells .",
    "we will write down with a concise mathematical notation the coupled equations of @xcite applied to a section across a leaf with the geometry specified above .",
    "subsequently we introduce a slight generalization of the active transport term in the equation .",
    "in every cell @xmath2 two substances play an important role in the growth process :    * the concentration of proteins pin@xmath6 in cell @xmath2 , which is time dependent , is denoted as @xmath7_i\\left(t\\right ) \\in \\mathbb{r}^+$ ] and is measured in micromol , i.e 10@xmath8mol , over the unit volume . we use the dimensionless variable @xmath9_i\\left(t\\right)/\\mu$]m .",
    "* the concentration of the hormone iaa in cell @xmath2 , also known as auxin , is also time dependent and is denoted as @xmath10_i\\left(t\\right ) \\in \\mathbb{r}^+$ ] . again in units of @xmath11 m .",
    "we use the dimensionless variable @xmath12_i\\left(t\\right)/\\mu$]m , which is denoted as @xmath13 .",
    "the model describes the evolution of these dimensionless concentrations in each cell .",
    "this evolution depends in a non - linear way on the concentrations of the neighboring cells .",
    "the value of @xmath14 is determined by the production and decay of pin@xmath6 .",
    "its time evolution for each cell @xmath15 is modeled by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the base production of pin1 proteins and @xmath18 is a coefficient capturing the up - regulation of pin1 production by auxin , both measured per second , @xmath19 is the saturation coefficient of the pin1 production , which is dimensionless , and @xmath20 is the pin1 decay constant , which has units of @xmath6/s .",
    "this means that the evolution of @xmath14 in time depends strictly on the concentration in the cell itself .",
    "the concentration of iaa in a cell depends not only on the production and the decay of auxin in the cell .",
    "change of @xmath13 is also determined by diffusion ( passive transport ) and active transport of auxin between the cells . the change over time of the concentration of iaa",
    "is modeled by the equation @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the iaa production coefficient which is measured per second , @xmath23 is the dimensionless coefficient which controls the saturation of iaa production , @xmath24 is the iaa decay constant and @xmath25 is the iaa diffusion coefficient , both measured per second .",
    "the active transport depends on the presence of pin1 denoted by @xmath26 and is modeled by the formula @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a polar iaa transport coefficient expressed per second , @xmath29 is the exponentiation base which controls the extent to which the pin1 protein distribution is affected by the neighboring cells and @xmath30 is an iaa transport saturation coefficient .",
    "these parameters are dimensionless . from equation we know that the evolution of @xmath31 depends only on itself , the first and the second nearest neighbors of cell @xmath2 .",
    "since we can specify the neighbors for every cell , the second nearest neighbors can be easily determined .",
    "for example the second neighbors of cell @xmath2 are all elements in @xmath32 .",
    "remark that because the length of each cell wall is taken to be the length unit , it cancels from the equation .",
    "equations , and describe the basic coupled model of smith _ et al . _ that has been used to study the transport of hormones in the arabidopsis shoot apex .",
    "it differs mainly from other transport models by the active transport term .",
    "et al . _ uses a quadratic dependence to describe the flux on the auxin concentrations instead of a linear dependence .",
    "further they introduce an exponential dependence of the localization of pin1 on the concentration of iaa .",
    "therefor we will also consider two other models .",
    "one where the active transport is modeled with a linear dependence to describe the flux on the auxin concentration @xmath33 and one model without the exponential dependence of the localization of pin1 on the concentration of iaa @xmath34 the three different equations that model the active transport ( equations , and ) can be combined in one generalized equation @xmath35 for @xmath36 and @xmath37 , , and describe the equations of @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "a row of 50 equal sized cells with periodic boundary conditions was investigated .",
    "the results of the time evolution , starting from an initially flat solution with a small amount of noise to break symmetry , showed the emergence of a pattern in the iaa concentrations ( figure [ fig : smithresults ] ) .",
    "some cells have a very high concentration of auxin .",
    "it was found that the peaks in a pattern are equally spaced and become more prominent for an increasing iaa transport coefficient t.     cells with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the shades of green show a difference in the iaa concentration .",
    "( figure reproduced from @xcite).,scaledwidth=60.0% ]",
    "in this paper we analyze the solutions of equations and , for a one dimensional file of equal sized square cells .",
    "we assume that this file of cells represents a part of a leaf from the left margin to the midvein .",
    "this assumption is necessary in order to specify the boundary condition .",
    "other parts of plant organs can give rise to other boundary conditions which will result in a small change in the model . to provide the boundary conditions ,",
    "two ghost cells are required at each end of the domain , since the model relates each cell with two cells at the left and the right ( figure [ fig : domainsteps ] ) .",
    "the @xmath5 interior cells are labeled @xmath6 to @xmath5 .",
    "the ghost cells are cells @xmath38 and @xmath39 at the left of the domain and cells @xmath40 and @xmath41 at the right .",
    "the concentration of the iaa hormone in the two ghost cells on each side are chosen to describe the influx at the boundary of the leaf and the efflux at the vein .",
    "the iaa concentration then changes linearly at the boundaries as if neumann boundary conditions are applied .",
    "we assume zero flux boundary conditions .",
    "this means that the boundary conditions become @xmath42 the value of @xmath43 and @xmath44 in the ghost cells is determined by equation that couples it to the value of @xmath13 in the ghost cell .",
    "note that @xmath45 and @xmath46 do not appear in the problem since equation does not require it .",
    "together with an initial condition , the problem is transformed in an initial value problem that we can solve numerically with a time step method .",
    "remark that these homogeneous neumann boundary conditions are different from periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the concentrations in the cells on the left side of the domain can indeed be different from the concentrations in the cells on the right side of the domain .",
    "equations , and contain @xmath47 parameters . a short description can be found in table [ table : parametervalues ] and further details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the values of these parameters must be real and positive .",
    "for the simulations in this paper we used three different parameter sets , m1 , m2 and m3 .",
    "parameter set m2 corresponds with the values used by @xcite .",
    "parameter set m1 and m3 contain the same values for the parameters as set m2 except for the iaa production coefficient .",

    "the parameter values of m2 are found in @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      similar to @xcite , we can solve the initial value problem of smith and collaborators with numerical integration .",
    "analysis of the eigenvalues of the jacobian shows that they are mostly located along the negative real axis with some small complex conjugate pairs of outliers at the left of the imaginary axis .",
    "this suggests that the fourth order runge - kutta method @xcite with time step @xmath48 results in a stable method to integrate the equations .        in figure",
    "[ fig : timeevolution ] the time evolution is shown from @xmath49 to @xmath50 .",

    "any other initial state nearby will lead to the same long term solution .",
    "+ figure [ fig : timeevolution ] shows the development of a pattern in the concentration of auxin . after a certain time the pattern arrives in a stable steady state . for the row of @xmath51 cells a single peak with a high iaa concentration is formed .      rather than evolving the system in time",
    ", we can calculate the steady state solutions directly .",
    "we rewrite equations , and in order to obtain the steady state equations for this specific geometry and boundary conditions .",
    "the steady state problem becomes : @xmath56 where the indices @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the first equation express the coupling of @xmath26 to @xmath57 in the first ghost cells .",
    "this system can be written as the system of equations @xmath58 where @xmath59 with @xmath5 the number of cells and @xmath60 the number of parameters .",

    "can be obtained in the same way .",
    "in this section we search for a trivial solution of system , a solution that can be calculated analytically and that will be used as a starting point for the numerical continuation in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "if we assume that the solution is homogeneous then the values of @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the same for all cells so that @xmath66 the system now reduces to @xmath67 and @xmath68 because @xmath26 and @xmath57 are real positive numbers , we find a unique solution that is given by @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "this is the trivial solution of the system .",
    "note that the same trivial solution is obtained for the models with active transport equation , or . from equation",
    "we know that for a certain parameter set , there is only one trivial homogeneous solution . by formula",
    "it is easy to calculate this trivial solution for different parameter values .",
    "figure [ fig : theorsol_rhoiaa ] shows the concentration of iaa in one cell ( cell number 6 ) versus the parameter @xmath71 . because the solution is homogeneous , the trivial solution curve would be the same for every cell and is independent of the number of cells .",
    "figure [ fig : theorsol_rhoiaa ] denotes also the trivial solution for parameter set m1 , m2 and m3 with a square .",
    "the value of the iaa concentration in the trivial solution is independent of the iaa diffusion coefficient d and the iaa transport coefficient t. furthermore , it does not depend on the type of model for the active transport .",
    "any choice of @xmath72 or @xmath73 yields to the same trivial solution . however , the stability depends in a sensitive way on the diffusion and transport coefficients and on the model of the active transport . although expression for the trivial solution is readily obtained , it is not easy to determine the stability of this solution .",
    "the jacobian matrix of the coupled system is not trivial .",
    "it has a sparse blocked structure where the first top - left block is diagonal and contains the linearization of eq .  .",
    "the top - right block is also diagonal and has the derivative of eq .   to @xmath57 .",
    "the bottom - left block is tridiagonal since the active transport in cell @xmath2 depends on @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "finally , the bottom right block has five diagonals because the active transport depends on the neighbors and the neighbors of the neighbors . because of the complicated structure the eigenvalues are non - trivial and we have found that for the coupled problem they are not necessarily real valued in contrast to the results of the uncoupled problem , see for example @xcite .",
    "the stability can , however , easily be calculated by numerical means and in our simulations we approximate the jacobian with central finite differences .",
    "the @xmath3-th column of @xmath77 is @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the unit vector with the @xmath3-th component equal to 1 and the other components equal to 0 .",
    "the column is then approximated as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is taken of the order of 10@xmath82 .",
    "once an approximation to the jacobian is obtained , its eigenvalues can be calculated .",
    "this numerical approach can also be used to study the stability of other solutions .",
    "the stability of the trivial solution of equation for a row of @xmath51 cells is shown in figure  [ fig : theorsol_rhoiaa ] . for smaller values of @xmath71",
    "the eigenvalues of the trivial solutions lie in the left half - plane of the complex plane .",
    "therefor these stable solutions are drawn with a full line in figure [ fig : theorsol_rhoiaa ] . for larger values of @xmath71 , at least one eigenvalue lies in the right half plane and so the trivial solution is unstable .",
    "this is indicated with a dotted line .    also for other parameter values",
    "we can calculate the stability of the trivial solution . in each plot on figure",
    "[ fig : stable_unstable_region ] two parameter values are varied .",
    "the other parameter values are taken as in parameter set m2 .",
    "the first row of figures corresponds with the stability region for equation ( i.e. the basic coupled model of @xcite ) and the second row of figures represents the stability regions for the steady state problem with a modified active transport equation .",
    "these plots show where the trivial solution is stable ( marked in gray ) for a row of @xmath51 cells .",
    "+    for example , figure [ fig : stable_unstable_region_rhoiaa_t ] shows that very small values of @xmath71 give a stable trivial solution for almost every value of t in the original model .",
    "all other values of @xmath71 give an unstable trivial solution if t is not too small .",
    "further we find that when the active transport is modeled with a linear dependence on the auxin concentration , the shape of the stability region of the trivial solution remains approximately the same but it is much smaller than with a quadratic dependency ( compare for example figure [ fig : stable_unstable_region_rhoiaa_t ] and figure [ fig : stable_unstable_region_rhoiaa_t2 ] ) .",
    "for both models we find that increasing the number of cells , leads to approximately the same shape of the stable region of the trivial solution ",
    "it only gets slightly smaller . applying the model without the exponential dependence of the localization of pin1 on the concentration of iaa results in a stable trivial solution for the entire tested range of parameters .",
    "the study of the relation between the stability of a solution and the parameters of the corresponding dynamical system is known as bifurcation analysis @xcite .",
    "such an analysis identifies the stable and unstable solutions and the bifurcation points that mark the transitions between them .",
    "this is biologically relevant since it will allow us to predict the patterns that emerge in the time evolution as the parameters of the model are changed .",
    "a bifurcation point is a solution @xmath83 of system where the number of solutions changes when @xmath84 passes @xmath85 . in this article",
    "there are several types of bifurcation points such branch points , limit points and hopf bifurcation points that will play a role .",
    "a branch point is a bifurcation point where two or more branches with distinct tangents intersect . a limit point ,",
    "also called a turning point , is a point where , locally , no solutions exist on one side of the limit point and two solutions on the other side .",
    "a hopf bifurcation is a transition where a periodic orbit appears and branch points and limit points are both bifurcation points among steady state solutions . for complete review of their properties",
    "wer refer to @xcite .",
    "the analysis usually leads to a bifurcation diagram that highlights the connections between stable and unstable branches as the parameters change .",
    "it is useful to track all these solution branches that emerge , split or end in a bifurcation point .",
    "this can be done with the help of numerical continuation methods .",
    "the system of equations is a smooth map and we know that @xmath86 . following the implicit function theorem we know that for a regular point @xmath87 of @xmath88 that satisfies @xmath89 , the solution set @xmath90 can be locally parametrized about @xmath91 with respect to some parameter @xmath92 .",
    "this means that the system of equations @xmath93 defines an implicit curve @xmath94 where @xmath95 is any parametric curve in the @xmath96 @xcite .",

    "to construct such a curve of subsequent solution points @xmath100 , continuation methods use a starting point @xmath101 , a solution of system , along with an initial continuation direction @xcite .",
    "this starting point is typically a trivial solution .",
    "an important family of the continuation methods are the predictor - corrector methods such as pseudo - arc - length continuation .",
    "the idea of the algorithm is to first predict a new solution point . in the corrector step , this predicted point is the start value for an iterative method that will approximate the solution to a given tolerance . for the pseudo - arc - length",
    ", the predictor step uses the tangent vector to the curve at a solution point and a given step size to predict a guess for the next solution point on the curve .",
    "the corrector step improves the guess with newton iterations .",
    "numerical continuation is available in auto @xcite , loca part of trilinos @xcite , pyds @xcite and others .",
    "these libraries can often also identify the bifurcations that occur along the continued curve and some of them , such as auto can automatically switch between branches at bifurcation points .",

    "the model describes the evolution of the concentration of pin1 and iaa in each of the cells by a coupled set of non - linear ordinary differential equations .",
    "the change in concentration of iaa in each cell depends only on pin1 and iaa concentrations in that cell , its nearest and next - nearest neighbors and this leads to a sparsely coupled system .",

    "we have varied the iaa transport coefficient t , the diffusion coefficient d and the production rate @xmath133 .",

    "however , changing the parameters , for example , increasing the iaa transport coefficient t , destroys its stability .",
    "in contrast to the uncoupled system studied by @xcite , the eigenvalues of the jacobian of this coupled system can not be easily analyzed analytically .",
    "the jacobian now has a blocked sparse structure and its eigenvalues are studied numerically .    in the exploration of the solutions , we identified two generic bifurcation scenarios through which the trivial solution loses its stability .",
    "these scenarios reappear for various choices of the parameters . in the first scenario",
    ", a stable solution can lose its stability through a branch point , where it becomes a pattern with regular spaced peaks of high auxin concentration .",
    "this solution was already found by smith and collaborators by direct numerical simulation .",
    "the spacing and the height of the peaks in the pattern depends on the other parameters of the system .",
    "however , we have found in the coupled system that the trivial state can also lose it stability through a hopf bifurcation , where the jacobian has two complex conjugate eigenvalues that become purely imaginary . for a limited parameter range",
    "this leads to stable periodic solutions , where the concentration in the cell changes periodically over time .",
    "however , for another range of parameters these periodic orbits are unstable and the trivial solution then loses its stability through an unstable orbit .",
    "the steady state solution then falls , beyond a parameter threshold , back to a pattern of regularly spaced peaks ( see figure [ fig : bifurcationdiagramsolutionshopf ] ) .",
    "these hopf bifurcation and the periodic solutions are not present in the model studied by jnsson where the pin1 concentration is kept constant and all eigenvalues of the jacobian are real .",
    "these are the only two bifurcation scenarios that we have found at the stability boundary of the trivial solution for various choices of the 11 parameters in the model and for an increasing number of cells in the row .",
    "we also explored modifications to the model of the active transport .",
    "the quadratic dependence on the auxin concentration is replaced by a linear dependence .",
    "the resulting bifurcation diagram is qualitatively the same .",
    "however , replacing the exponential dependence of the pin localization on the auxin transport leads to a different dynamical system where the trivial solution is always stable .",
    "although the paper studies the steady state solutions of a rather academic model with a row of equal sized square cells , the authors believe it is a valuable contribution to our understanding of pattern formation by auxin accumulation since it builds the foundation for a rigorous bifurcation analysis of the steady state patterns in a two dimensional array of cells .",
    "as demonstrated by @xcite generalized linear models are a powerful first step to understand the behavior of the biological system .",
    "such studies can be complemented by simulations of patterns of higher complexity that more closely resemble specific biological systems .    applying the numerical continuation framework to a more general network of connected",
    "( ir)regular shaped cells , requires a newton - krylov solver so that the newton iteration deals with the non - linearity and the krylov iteration solves the jacobian system exploiting the sparsity .",
    "furthermore the krylov subspace iteration only requires the application of the jacobian to a vector , which avoids the explicit construction of the jacobian matrix @xcite .",
    "for the two dimensional array of cells , we expect to find a similar trivial solution that will lose again its stability as the parameters change and turn into regular patterns of high concentration peaks and time periodic solutions .    in this paper",
    "we , essentially re - implemented the same linear file of cells as @xcite , but instead of using wrap - around boundary conditions , we implemented homogeneous neumann boundary conditions . in principle",
    "it is also possible to investigate the effect of varying in- and out - flux from the system and performing similar studies for these inhomogeneous neumann boundary conditions .",
    "however , then there is no analytically solvable trivial solution .",
    "there are several situations where changing boundary conditions are biologically relevant .",
    "first , in the leaf mesophyll , where a row of cells in which local maxima may induce new vascular development could be located between margins .",
    "these are a possible source of auxin and emerging veins that drain the auxin @xcite , or at a later stage be surrounded by veins draining locally produced auxin .",
    "second , in epidermal cells at the shoot apex along a tip to base gradient , where auxin comes in from the base and is transported to apical positions . and",
    "finally , in central linear cell files in the root , auxin flows from base to tip and in the external layers auxin flows from the tip to the base leading to auxin gradients @xcite .",
    "we have explored continuation in the neumann boundary condition and found , amongst others , s - shaped bifurcation diagrams with double limit points .",
    "this leads to a hysteresis effect in the boundary conditions .",
    "this is described in @xcite .    also for problems with periodic boundary conditions",
    "a similar analysis can be performed . there , however , the jacobian will have a one dimensional null - space associated with the translation invariance of solutions .",
    "this can be regularized by introducing a phase condition as described by @xcite .",
    "there are still many uncertainties in the current generation of models .",
    "especially the large number of parameters and the uncertainty in their values is a reason for concern . by focusing on the qualitative properties of the transitions that appear in the models rather than on the states for particular choices of the parameters ,",
    "we hope to understand more about the possible patterns that appear in real systems .",
    "it is valuable to calculate similar bifurcation diagrams for all the proposed models for auxin transport using the numerical continuation methods .",
    "we could also use homotopy and use a continuous transformation to go from one model into another model .",
    "numerical continuation can then follow the solutions from one model into the solutions of another model .",
    "this will allow the comparison of models across a range of parameters and check if they exhibit qualitatively the same transition if parameters change .    in real plants",
    "it is impossible to tune a parameter such as the transport coefficient t in a continuous way as is done in these calculations .",
    "it can only be changed in discrete steps in a plant by the introduction of , for example , mutations that compromise or enhance the auxin production or transport . comparing such experiments with the model outcome will make it possible to refine the models to give a more realistic description of the biological system .    the bifurcation analysis on the linear system with zero - influx at the boundaries yields interesting new insights into the potential behaviors of the biological system .",
    "it is interesting to note that low values of the iaa transport coefficient lead to flat distributions of the auxin concentration , whereas high concentrations are required to establish sharp accumulation peaks .",
    "1-n - naphthylphthalamic acid ( npa ) has long been used experimentally as an inhibitor of auxin efflux .",
    "the precise molecular mechanism by which npa impacts on auxin transport is still unknown , although several npa - binding proteins have been identified @xcite .",
    "previously , we have assumed that npa inhibits the cycling of pin proteins to the cell membrane @xcite . in terms of our model",
    ", this would relate to a lowering of @xmath134 and/or @xmath135 which results in the formation of lower auxin peaks .",
    "indeed , experimental inhibition of auxin transport with npa abolishes the normal narrow accumulation peaks and results in a much flatter auxin distribution pattern @xcite . also consistently with the model , the vam3 mutation that perturbs pin1 polarization , prevents auxin peaks forming and inhibits formation of higher order veins @xcite .",
    "more recently it was shown that a mutation in the auxin import carrier lax2 , which inhibits auxin transport increases the numbers of vascular strand breaks @xcite , which may also be explained by the model prediction of lower auxin maxima , which could be unable to fully induce vascular development .",
    "thus , the model behavior appears to be consistent with physiological treatments and mutations that affect specific model parameters .",
    "the bifurcation analysis also yields interesting new insights into additional potential behaviors of the biological system .",
    "one especially interesting behavior is the oscillation obtained with a specific set of parameter values ( fig [ fig : timeevolutionperiodic ] ) .",
    "this behavior has to our knowledge never been observed in the context of leaf development .",
    "however , in the root basal meristem , oscillating auxin concentrations have been observed and related to the regular induction of laterals along the growing axis of the root @xcite .",
    "one other characteristic unveiled by the bifurcation analysis is that across the region where a pattern of auxin accumulation peaks are generated , these peaks occur at very stable distances .",
    "this would imply that in the case of vascular patterning , the initial distance between veins is relatively stable , implying that observed differences in vascular density in mature leaves @xcite largely result from differences in subsequent development .",
    "this is an example of an new hypothesis generated by modeling a biological process that can be experimentally validated and underlines the importance of systematic exploration of biologically relevant parameter variations .",
    "it is important to repeat that we have kept the plant geometry fixed in the current model .",
    "it is an open question how the calculations can be extended to include cells to undergo growth and division .",
