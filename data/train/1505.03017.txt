    "images obtained through a turbulent medium ( like the atmosphere ) suffer from serious quality degradation .",
    "there are several methods developed to alleviate this problem .",
    "one of them is the adaptive optics @xcite , which is a method commonly used in astronomy , microscopy and surveillance . in this technique ,",
    "a high - speed camera monitors continuously the shape of the wave front and the closed - loop system compensates for the wave distortions by deforming a special mirror in the optical path @xcite .",
    "however , this approach is very complex , expensive and requires sophisticated equipment ( e.g. the deformable mirror or the wavefront sensing devices ) .",
    "moreover , the required wavefront diagnostics is available only for the objects much brighter than the background .",
    "if there is not enough light to perform the wavefront analysis , only the tip - tilt correction is applied @xcite .",
    "it is accomplished by oscillating an additional mirror in optical path , which results in real - time image shifting @xcite .",
    "another , much simplified yet efficient approach , is the lucky imaging @xcite , where consecutive short exposures are analyzed , shifted to the brightest speckle and stacked together , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] . only the images with the highest strehl ratio",
    "are included , hence the final image is the average of the frames captured under best atmospheric conditions .",
    "the probability of obtaining such good quality and unblurred frames is a function of the aperture size of @xmath0 and the fried parameter @xmath1 @xcite :    [ ]        @xmath2    however , even those good quality frames are shifted relative to each other .",
    "the cancellation of tip - tilt component recovers about 50% of spatial distribution in most cases @xcite . that kind of recovery is possible only if the source is intensive enough , so that a single frame contains clearly visible brightest speckles .",
    "moreover , the brightest speckle varies very quickly and it is assumed to be stable for a very short , so - called coherence time ( about 10ms ) @xcite . to the best of our knowledge , there were no successful attempts to recover the high quality spatial distribution of the objects using shift - and - add method , if neither the brightest speckle nor the signal centroid is visible in a single exposure .",
    "in this paper we present a novel technique based on the genetic algorithm ( ga ) , which allows for individual frames centring , even if the brightest speckle is not distinguishable , ( see example of such frame in fig .  [",
    "fig : f2]c ) .",
    "our method does not require any additional information about observed object , so it may be employed in a wide range of applications .",

    "it searches a solution space in order to achieve a given goal , so that in each evolution of the algorithm , a part of individuals is randomly modified in hope to produce new , better solutions .",
    "the best individuals ( elite ) are transferred directly between the evolutions .",
    "another group in the population is created by the mutation of the elite .",
    "finally , in each iteration , a part of individuals is created randomly to prevent getting stuck at a local minimum .",
    "the use of ga on a large number of frames allows to evolve the set of frames shifts toward the highest energy of averaged frame , i.e.  to maximize the value of @xmath3 defined as :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the number of counts in a pixel at position ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 )  and  _ n _ , _ m _ denotes the frame s width and height .",
    "we used such a fitness function , because only the perfect alignment of all images provides the maximum sum of squared counts .",
    "as the errors occur in shifts estimations , the counts from the object are spread between many pixels in the averaged stack , thus our metric decreases . before the energy calculation",
    ", we perform background estimation utilizing a median over all pixels in stacked images .",
    "then , the background level is subtracted , hence the influence of background counts on the energy measure @xmath3 is significantly reduced .    in our simulations , first we used airy discs as sources @xcite .",
    "it is the best description of spot light that a perfect lens with circular aperture can produce .",
    "the disc size is governed by the diffraction limit , what may be observed in spaceborne telescope missions due to a lack of turbulent medium between the imager and the object ( the interested reader is referred to e.g. @xcite ) . to simulate real count results in each pixel ,",
    "we utilized poisson distribution , where the mean value was determined from the sum of background and object counts @xcite .",
    "we present an exemplary result of simulated airy discs in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2]a , where the objects produce 61 photons and the entire background counts equals 677 .",
    "finally , we combined the counts of the background with the ones from the object and added gaussian readout noise of imager amplifier .",
    "we adjusted the level of noise and source , so that the object can not be distinguished from the background noise ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : f2]c ) .",
    "in ga we optimized two variables per each frame  the shifts in _ x _ and _ y _ directions .",
    "such an approach produces a huge number of variables , thus a whole set of combinations can not be tested in reasonable time even with the most powerful computers .",
    "assuming that the object tip - tilt effect is limited to @xmath8__p _ _ pixels in each direction , we have the following number of possible shift combinations  @xmath9 for @xmath10 images in a series :    @xmath11    in contrast , with the use of ga , this optimization process can be significantly reduced , since the algorithm promotes and modifies only viable shifts combinations while the others are discarded .",
    "for example , in our experiments , the recovery of 70 frames of size 100@xmath12100 , took about 30 minutes ( 1500 generations ) in the case of simple point - like sources .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq3 ] ) ,   3.75e+479 years would be required on the same computer to search a whole combinations space ( @xmath9=1.97e+489 combinations for @xmath10=70 images in a series , maximum shift @xmath13=7 ; the computational time of a single shift - and - add procedure is 6ms ) .",
    "we used 700 individuals in our ga population . by an individual",
    "we understand the vector of shifts in @xmath14 and @xmath15 directions for all images in a series ( e.g. for 100 images the individual is 200-elements vector ) . in each iteration",
    ", the best solution was transferred directly from the previous population and 500 individuals were created by the crossover procedure from the shifts estimations of previous 140 individuals ( elite ) .",
    "we employed scattered crossover , thus each shift of newly created solution was selected from a random individual from the elite .",
    "next 100 individuals were created by mutation , where we changed the shifts of previous best individual using the gaussian distribution with a standard deviation equal to 1/3 of maximum available shift .",
    "the ga final outcomes were the shifts estimations obtained after 1500 iterations . such value was chosen due to the observed satisfactory results in this initial part of the convergence process and due to the reasonable computational time ( 30 minutes ) .",
    "it should be noted , that better outcomes may be obtained after much longer ga run .",
    "however it would require randomly varying calculation time , often reaching tens of hours .",
    "it is difficult to present strict numeric properties of the method , since each individual run depends on its randomly generated starting point . nevertheless , from multiple tests we observed , that the method allows for the recovery of the spatial distribution of objects as dim , as 2% of their mean background .",
    "for such intensity of light , about 70 exposures were required to obtain satisfactory results using our ga - based algorithm .",
