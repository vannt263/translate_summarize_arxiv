    "one of the main tasks of quantum information theory is the evaluation of the capacities of quantum channels for the transmission of classical or quantum information .",
    "recently , a growing attention has been devoted to the study of quantum channels with memory .",
    "coding theorems were provided for a subset of memory channels @xcite , the so - called ` forgetful channels ' .",
    "one can distinguishes the cases in which the output at the @xmath0th use of the channel is influenced by the input at the @xmath1th use , with @xmath2 , as the models studied in @xcite ; and those in which memory effects come from correlations among subsequent channel uses , as the ones considered in @xcite .",
    "here we consider the second case , which is also referred to as ` channel with correlated noise ' .",
    "a correlation - free channel can be considered as an ideal limit since correlations are unavoidable in physical realizations .",
    "another motivation for studying channels with correlated noise is the possibility of enhancing the information capacities .",
    "there are indeed evidences of the possibility of amplifying the classical capacity in both the cases of discrete @xcite and continuous @xcite variables quantum channels .    here",
    "we consider a model of bosonic gaussian channel in which memory effects come from the interaction with a bosonic gaussian environment .",
    "the model is a generalization of the one discussed in @xcite and it belongs to a family of channels presented in @xcite . even though each channel belonging to this family is unitary equivalent to a memoryless one ( in the sense specified in @xcite ) , the presence of energy constraints can break the unitary symmetry , leaving the problem of capacities evaluation open .",
    "an instance of a channel belonging to that family is obtained by specifying the state of the environment .",
    "here we consider a multimode squeezed thermal state , determined by two parameters .",
    "the first parameter expresses the degree of squeezing , which in turn determines the amount of correlations in the channel ; the second one is a temperature parameter expressing the mixedness of the state .",
    "it is clear that at zero temperature the correlations in the multimode squeezed state are quantum , on the other hand above a certain temperature the states becomes separable and the correlations are classical .",
    "the choice of a gaussian state for the environment makes in turns the channel gaussian . in this way , using @xcite , we are able to evaluate , analytically or numerically , the classical and quantum capacities of the memory channel . to emphasize the role of correlations , we compare two different scenarios for encoding and decoding classical and quantum information : in the first one , which we refer to as the _ global scenario _ , we allow preparation of states at the input field which are entangled among different channel uses ; in the second one , called the _ local scenario _ , we only allow preparation of simply separable states ( i.e.  uncorrelated ) at the input field , moreover we do not allow the receiver to access the correlations among the output modes .",
    "the paper develops along the following lines . in section [ model ]",
    "we present the model and define the global and the local encoding / decoding scenarios . in section [ capacities ]",
    "we present analytical and numerical results for the classical , entanglement - assisted , and quantum capacity .",
    "conclusions and comments are drawn in section [ conclude ] .",
    "we consider an instance of the general model for a bosonic channel with correlated noise presented in @xcite . for any integer @xmath3",
    ", its action is defined over a set of @xmath3 input bosonic oscillators , with canonical variables @xmath4 . a collection of ancillary modes @xmath5 , which play the role of the environment ,",
    "is also needed . in the following we refer to this set of oscillators as the input and environment _ local modes_. all the frequencies",
    "are assumed to be degenerate and equal to one , together with @xmath6 .",
    "the integer @xmath0 labels the sequential uses of the channel . at the @xmath0th use",
    ", the @xmath0th input mode is linearly mixed with the @xmath0th mode of the environment at a beam splitter with given transmissivity @xmath7 ( see figure [ fig_model ] ) . in the heisenberg picture",
    "the channel transforms the input field variables as @xmath8 a constraint on the energy is required to avoid infinite capacities .",
    "we constraint the average number of photons at the input field ; for a given @xmath9 we require : @xmath10        memory effects appear in the presence of correlations among the local modes of the environment . for a given integer @xmath3 , a channel @xmath11 over the @xmath3 input modes is defined . in the schroedinger picture",
    "its action is @xmath12 where @xmath13 indicates the state of the input field , @xmath14 is the unitary transformation at the @xmath3 beam splitters , @xmath15 indicates the state of the environment field and @xmath16 the partial trace over the environment variables .",
    "the channel is correlation - free if the state of the environment is simply separable ( i.e.uncorrelated ) in the basis of the local mode .",
    "we assume the environment to be in a gaussian state , which in turns makes the channel gaussian . here",
    "we consider an environment covariance matrix of the following _ block - diagonal _ form : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this is a _ bona fide _ covariance matrix as long as the matrix @xmath20 is symmetric and @xmath21 . to fix the ideas we chose a @xmath22 matrix @xmath20 of the following form : @xmath23 in this way , for @xmath24",
    ", we recover the model analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the physical interpretation is that of a multimode squeezed thermal state , that can be obtained by applying the multimode squeezing operator ( see @xcite ) @xmath25}\\ ] ] to a thermal state with @xmath26 average excitations per mode .",
    "since the memory of the channel comes from squeezing in the environment we refer to the parameter @xmath27 ( or @xmath28 ) as the _ memory parameter _ ; for @xmath29 the environment is a correlation - free thermal state .",
    "the integer @xmath3 can be interpreted as the characteristic length of correlations . to evaluate lower bounds",
    "we need the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath20 which were presented in @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues are @xmath30 where the corresponding eigenvectors have components @xmath31    let us introduce the global variables @xmath32 , defined from the eigenvectors of @xmath20 as : @xmath33 it follows that the environment covariance matrix is diagonal in this basis ; it can be written as a direct sum @xmath34 of single - mode covariance matrices of the form : @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "hence , moving to the global variables , the state of the environment is the direct product of @xmath3 modes , each being in a squeezed thermal state , with squeezing parameter @xmath37 and @xmath26 thermal photons .      in the following sections we estimate the quantum and classical capacities for a given value of the correlation length @xmath3 . to emphasize the role of correlations we compare two different encoding / decoding scenarios .",
    "the first scenario is a global one , in the sense that it involves preparation of the input field in states which are ( in general ) entangled among different uses of the channel ( i.e.  among the local modes ) .",
    "the second scenario is a local one , involving preparation of the input field in states which are simply separable among the channel uses ; moreover we do not allow the receiver to access the correlations among different local modes at the output field .    as to the global scenario , we introduce the following global variables at the input field @xmath38 ( notice that this set of variables is ` parallel ' to the environment global variables defined in ( [ collective ] ) ) and consider states of the input field which are factorized in the basis of these global modes .",
    "these states are in general entangled among channel uses ( i.e.  among local modes ) . in terms of the global variables ,",
    "the channel factorizes as @xmath39 where the channel @xmath40 acts on the @xmath41th global mode of the input field . in the heisenberg picture @xmath40",
    "transforms the @xmath41th global input variables as : @xmath42 furthermore , due to the form of the transformation ( [ point ] ) ( a linear passive one , see [ appxa ] ) , the energy constraint is preserved in the basis of global variables : @xmath43 it is worth noticing that the channel @xmath40 is a lossy bosonic channel in which one ( global ) mode is mixed with an environment mode which is squeezed ( it is described by the covariance matrix ( [ coll_modek ] ) ) .",
    "hence the @xmath3-use channel is unitary equivalent to a correlation - free channel , which is the product of @xmath3 single - mode channels .",
    "concerning the local scenario let us say that , as long as the correlations among the local modes at the output field are neglected , the environment can be effectively described by a state which is factorized in the local modes .",
    "for each @xmath0 , by integrating the environment wigner function over the local variables @xmath44 for @xmath45 , we obtain the wigner function of the @xmath0th local mode of the environment .",
    "the corresponding state is thermal - like , the average number of photon can be computed from ( [ collective ] ) , yielding : @xmath46 and @xmath37 , this can be rewritten as follows : @xmath47 hence in the local scenario the state of the environment can be substituted with a thermal state with @xmath0-dependent temperature .",
    "notice that , as one can expect , the _ local temperature _ @xmath48 monotonically increases with @xmath28 .",
    "this section is devoted to the evaluation of classical and quantum capacities of the channel @xmath11 .",
    "this requires the constrained optimization of several entropic quantities , as the holevo information , the quantum mutual information , the coherent information .",
    "let us recall that the von neumann entropy @xmath49 of a @xmath3 mode gaussian state @xmath50 can be computed as follows : @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the @xmath3 symplectic invariants , i.e.  the symplectic eigenvalues of the covariance matrix ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in the case of a single mode with covariance matrix @xmath54",
    "the only symplectic invariant is @xmath55 , and the symplectic eigenvalue is @xmath56 .",
    "it is worth remarking that both in the global and local scenarios introduced above the evaluation of the entropy of the @xmath3-mode fields reduces to the single - mode case .    as to the evaluation of the classical capacity of a quantum channel @xmath57 , one",
    "is led to the holevo information , defined as @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes the quantum state encoding the classical variable @xmath60 , with probability density @xmath61 , and @xmath50 is the ensemble state , @xmath62 .",
    "the evaluation of quantum capacity and entanglement assisted classical capacity involves the coherent information , defined as @xmath63 the quantity denoted @xmath64 is the entropy exchange , defined as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a purification of the state @xmath50 involving an ancillary system , and @xmath67 is the identical channel acting on the ancilla .",
    "it is worth remarking that gaussian encoding it is known to be optimal for classical @xcite and quantum capacities @xcite in the memoryless case .",
    "motivated by these results we are going to estimate the capacities of the memory channel using gaussian encoding .    concerning the global scenario , the maximization of the entropic functions is performed over a set of gaussian states which are simply separable with respect to the global modes . notice that these states are in general entangled in the local basis , i.e.  entangled among channel uses .",
    "in particular , we consider covariance matrices of the form @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the covariance matrix of the @xmath41th global input mode . for real @xmath70 and @xmath71 , the @xmath41th covariance matrix is chosen as follows : @xmath72 under the action of the channel @xmath40 this matrix is mapped into the covariance matrix @xmath73    the energy constraint can be written in terms of the input covariance matrix as @xmath74 that is @xmath75 it can be useful to write the energy constraints in two steps , namely @xmath76    concerning the local scenario , as noticed above",
    ", the channel reduces to a correlation - free channel with thermal environment , with a @xmath0-dependent effective temperature . for this kind of channel ,",
    "expressions for the ( one - shot ) classical and quantum capacities are available in literature @xcite and will be used as a term of comparison .",
    "first , let us compute an upper bound for the classical capacity of the memory channel .",
    "this can be obtained by the maximal output entropy . for given @xmath3",

    "motivated by the fact that it is optimal for the memoryless channel @xcite we consider encoding in displaced states : @xmath87 here @xmath88 denotes a gaussian seed state , not necessarily the vacuum , of the @xmath3 mode input field . as to the global scenario , its covariance matrix is assumed to be as in equations ( [ in_cov ] ) , ( [ in_cov_par ] ) .",
    "the displacement operator can be decomposed in the basis of global modes as @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the displacement amplitude of the @xmath41th global input mode , and @xmath91 .",

    "the classical noise induces an ensemble state described by the covariance matrix @xmath96 that , under the action of the channel @xmath40 , is mapped into @xmath97    in our setting , the lower bound for the classical capacity is computed by maximizing the holevo information @xmath98 over the @xmath99 parameters @xmath100 under the energy constraints @xmath101 for given values of @xmath9 , @xmath102 , @xmath26 and for sufficiently small values of @xmath27 we can write an explicit solution .",

    "the range of @xmath27 for which these values are optimal is defined by the conditions @xmath108 , @xmath109 . in that range , we are able to provide the following analytical lower bound for the classical capacity per channel use : @xmath110 - g\\left [ ( 1-\\eta ) t \\right].\\ ] ] for @xmath24 , this improves the lower bound computed in @xcite . from the lower",
