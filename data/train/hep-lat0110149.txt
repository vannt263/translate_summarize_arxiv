    "theoretical understanding on the nature of the finite temperature qcd phase transition and its thermodynamic properties is indispensable in extracting an unambiguous signal of quark - gluon plasma production from heavy - ion collision experiments . in particular",
    ", the equation of state ( eos ) of quark - gluon plasma belongs to the most basic information needed . here , numerical simulations of lattice qcd provides us with the only systematic way to calculate these quantities directly from the first principles of qcd @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "i present our study of finite temperature qcd on the lattice with dynamical u and d quarks , focusing on the efforts toward a precise determination of the eos @xcite .",
    "calculations are made on the cp - pacs computer , a dedicated parallel computer developed at the university of tsukuba in 1996 by physicists and computer scientists @xcite . with 2048 node processors",
    "the peak performance of the cp - pacs is 614.4 gflops .",
    "intensive lattice qcd calculations on the cp - pacs have clarified the existence of quenched errors in the traditional calculations of light hadron spectrum in the quenched approximation @xcite , and opened the way towards precise full qcd calculations of hadronic quantities through the first systematic study of the light hadron spectrum with dynamical u , d quarks @xcite .",
    "our simulations of finite temperature qcd are based on the experiences of these zero - temperature studies .",
    "until recently , eos with dynamical quarks has been computed only with the kogut - susskind ( staggered ) type lattice fermions because of a smaller computational demand and persistence of a part of the chiral symmetry on the lattice @xcite .",
    "the staggered fermion action , however , only allows four degenerate quark flavors , and the physically interesting cases of 2 and @xmath5 flavors are simulated by artificially modifying a coefficient in the update algorithm , effectively introducing a non - local action .",
    "it has also been found that the critical scaling for two - flavor chiral transition extracted with this formalism does not reproduce the theoretically expected o(4 ) critical exponents @xcite .",
    "these problems of the staggered fermions make it imperative to study the issue with alternative lattice fermions  wilson - type fermions or recently proposed lattice chiral fermions .",
    "the latter fermions , however , require too much computational cost on current computers to perform a systematic investigation over a wide range of the parameter space .",
    "wilson - type fermions have the manifest flavor symmetry and locality for any number of flavors .",
    "on the other hand , chiral symmetry is explicitly broken at finite lattice spacings , which complicates the phase diagram analysis on one hand and introduce sizable lattice artifacts on the other hand . here ,",
    "improvement of the lattice action was shown to be effective in reducing the lattice artifacts in finite temperature qcd @xcite .",
    "in particular , the expected o(4 ) scaling was observed around the two - flavor chiral transition @xcite .    from these observations , and also from a preparatory study of improved actions @xcite",
    ", we adopt an rg improved gauge action coupled with a clover - improved wilson quark action , as in our zero - temperature full qcd simulations @xcite .",
    "our simulation parameters are summarized in @xcite .",
    "we study @xmath0 and 6 lattices .",
    "the temperature is given by @xmath6 , where we determine the lattice spacing @xmath7 by the vector meson mass @xmath8 at @xmath9 .",
    "results for the phase diagram , together with the simulation points for the eos study , are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase](a ) .",
    "the horizontal axis is the inverse bare gauge coupling @xmath10 . the vertical axis , the hopping parameter @xmath11 , corresponds to the freedom of the bare quark mass .",
    "the chiral limit is given by the @xmath12 line .",
    "the triangular region to the left , surrounded by the lines @xmath13 , is the parity - flavor broken phase @xcite for @xmath0 .",
    "dashed lines @xmath14 are the finite temperature pseudocritical lines for @xmath0 ( left ) and 6 ( right ) . which are determined by the peak position of the susceptibility for a z(3)-rotated polyakov loop .",
    "in previous studies of eos with staggered - type quark actions , the pressure and energy density are determined as functions of temperature for a fixed value of bare quark mass @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "while @xmath17 and @xmath18 are practically easy to set in simulations , the results at different temperatures represent values for different physical systems with different renormalized quark masses .",
    "this is not useful for phenomenological applications ; we want to see the temperature dependence of thermodynamic observables for a fixed physical system with fixed renormalized quark mass , _",
    "i.e. , _ on a line of constant physics .    therefore , it is important to evaluate the lines of constant physics also in finite temperature physics .",
    "our results for the lines of constant physics , which are defined by fixed values of the ratio @xmath19 of the pseudo - scalar to vector meson masses at zero temperature , are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase](b ) by solid lines .",
    "in the same figure , we also plot the lines of constant temperature normalized by the pseudocritical temperature @xmath20 at @xmath21 on the same line of constant physics .",
    "we first study the chiral transition temperature @xmath22 in the limit of massless quarks . in the phase diagram , fig .",
    "[ fig : phase](a ) , the chiral transition point is the crossing point of the chiral limit line @xmath12 and the finite temperature pseudocritical line @xmath14 .",
    "we confirmed that the o(4 ) critical scaling , expected from an effective sigma model , is well satisfied with our data @xcite .",
    "this implies that the chiral transition is second order in two - flavor qcd .    from a theoretical argument",
    ", we expect that the parity - broken phase at finite @xmath18 locates in the low temperature phase @xcite .",
    "this provides us with an estimate of the lower bound for the chiral transition point ; @xmath23 from the @xmath13 lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase](a ) . we can also estimate @xmath24 using the o(4 ) scaling properties of observables : from an o(4 )",
    "fit to the chiral condensate , we find @xmath25 . on the other hand , from an o(4 ) scaling ansatz to the @xmath14 line , we obtain @xmath26 . collecting all the results , and converting to the physical units using the vector meson mass at @xmath9 , we obtain @xmath27 mev as our best estimate @xcite .",
    "we calculate the pressure @xmath28 by the integral method @xcite . for the energy density @xmath29",
    ", we combine the results for @xmath28 and those for the interaction measure @xmath30 obtained by the differential method .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eos ] .",
    "the continuum limit corresponds to the limit of large @xmath18 .",
    "our data show a 50% decrease from @xmath0 to 6 , both in the pressure and energy density , which is too large to attempt a continuum extrapolation . on @xmath3 lattices , however , the magnitude and temperature dependence of the two quantities are quite similar between our improved wilson quark action and the staggered quark action @xcite . together with the fact that the @xmath3 results are close to the continuum sb limit at high temperatures , the approximate agreement of eos between two different types of actions may be suggesting that the @xmath3 results are not far from the continuum limit . in fig .  [",
    "fig : eos ] , different values of @xmath19 correspond to different renormalized light quark masses .",
    "we find that the dependence on the quark mass is quite small for @xmath310.8 .",
    "a weak quark mass dependence appears only at @xmath32 for @xmath0 ( the errors for the @xmath3 data are still large to conclude a quark mass dependence ) .",
    "we find that the pressure and energy density in the quenched qcd ( @xmath33 ) are much smaller @xcite ; only about 1/7 of the values at @xmath34 .",
    "see figs .",
    "15 and 17 of @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that most dynamical quark effects are saturated between @xmath33 and 0.9 .",
    "therefore , although the light u , d quark mass point , @xmath35 , is still far away , our values for the eos at @xmath360.8 may be already close to those at the physical point , except in the very vicinity of the chiral transition point where a singular limit according to the o(4 ) critical exponents is expected .",
    "this result of small quark mass dependence may not be surprising since hadron mass results in our zero - temperature simulations @xcite show that the renormalized quark mass at @xmath37  gev in the @xmath38 scheme at @xmath390.8 equals @xmath40200  mev , which is similar in magnitude to the critical temperature @xmath41  mev estimated for two - flavor qcd . for comparison , finite mass corrections for free fermion gas only amount to 7% when the temperature equals the fermion mass @xmath42 , and exceed 50% only when @xmath43 .",
    "we have shown that a study of finite temperature qcd with wilson - type quarks is feasible when improved lattice actions are adopted . based on a systematic determination of the lines of constant physics",
    ", we calculate thermodynamic quantities in improved lattice qcd with two flavors of wilson - type quarks on @xmath0 and 6 lattices , in the range @xmath20.95 and @xmath44 .",
    "we found that the quark mass dependence is small for @xmath4 .",
    "concerning the continuum extrapolation , we find large scaling violations in eos at @xmath0 , while @xmath3 results are suggested to be not far from the continuum limit .",
    "therefore , a precise continuum extrapolation may be possible from simulations at @xmath45 .",
    "this is , however , computationally quite demanding . in this connection",
    ", i would like to introduce our recent study of eos using anisotropic lattices @xcite : we found that , in quenched qcd , anisotropic lattice is efficient to reduce discretization errors in eos , such that a precise continuum extrapolation is possible with much smaller amount of computer time .",
