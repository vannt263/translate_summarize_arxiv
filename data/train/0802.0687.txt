    "the solar magnetic field is an important quantity which couples the solar interior , the photosphere and the atmosphere .",
    "the quasi stationary coronal magnetic field configuration is an interesting and challenging topic on its own right .",
    "but even to understand basic processes like coronal mass ejections and flares it is important to understand the quiescent magnetic configuration out of which these dynamic phenomena arise .",
    "unfortunately the coronal magnetic field can not be measured directly , but it has to be reconstructed from photospheric measurements .",
    "a magnetic field reconstruction of the solar corona has to be consistent with the observed spatial variation of the coronal plasma ( density , pressure , temperature ) often elongated along the magnetic field .",
    "here we are mainly interested in long living structures which are time independent in first order .",
    "we also concentrate on closed magnetic configuration where a stationary plasma flow ( solarwind ) does not significantly contribute to the force balance .",
    "such configurations are static equilibria and have to obey the magnetohydrostatic equations ( mhs ) .    as the magnetic field @xmath0 and",
    "the density distribution @xmath1 are physically closely related their model reconstruction should also be linked as much as possible . in this paper",
    "we attempt to show how this can be achieved .",
    "we propose variational principles which if they can be solved should give a consistent model for an isothermal corona .",
    "for the magnetic field reconstruction this leads to a generalization of a nonlinear force - free approach by @xcite , for the density reconstruction we obtain a tomography problem with an improved regularization term .",
    "the ground based or space - born magnetograph observation provide either the line - of - sight magnetic field ( @xmath2 , e.g. mdi on soho ) , which is sufficient for potential and linear force - free fields , or all three components of the photospheric magnetic field ( e.g. ivm in hawaii , expected also from solarb ) .",
    "the latter information is sufficient to determine nonlinear force - free fields completely . as a force - free approximation",
    "is justified only in the limit of a vanishing plasma @xmath3 , we take into account forces ( pressure gradient and gravity ) for configurations with a finite plasma @xmath3 even though we shall consider @xmath3 small .",
    "popular simplifications for the reconstruction of coronal magnetic fields are :    * potential fields ( @xmath4 ) ( e.g.  ; ; ; ; ) * linear force - free fields ( e.g. ; ; ; ; ; ) * linear non force - free fields ( e.g. ; ; ; ; ) * nonlinear force - free fields ( e.g. ; ; ; ; ; ; ) .    within this work",
    "we do not use any of these assumptions but consider the general case of nonlinear non - force - free equilibria .",
    "the mathematical problem of calculating nonlinear non - force - free fields is closely related to the problem of calculating nonlinear force - free fields which coincides with the above in the limit of @xmath5 . under ideal conditions the information contained in a ( perfect ) vectormagnetogram together with the force - free condition",
    "would be sufficient to calculate the coronal magnetic field . within this work",
    "we show that the information contained in a vectormagnetogram together with a tomographic reconstructed coronal density distribution and the assumption of magnetohydrostatic force balance is as well sufficient to calculate the finite @xmath3 coronal magnetic field .",
    "unfortunately current vectormagnetograms and tomographic reconstruction are far from being perfect , which affects the quality of reconstruction . within this work we use well known mhs - equilibria to test our newly developed reconstruction program .",
    "the use of analytic equilibria as artificial data allows us to extract ideal vectormagnetograms as well as ideal coronal density distributions .    as for the density observations , ground based coronagraphs ( e.g. , the mark iii coronagraph on hawaii , lasco coronagraph on soho and the future stereo mission )",
    "provide the line of sight integrated density structure of the solar corona from different relative viewpoints as the sun rotates .",
    "these measurements have been used for a 3d - reconstruction of the coronal plasma distribution with help of tomographic methods @xcite .",
    "the major problems here are :    * the assumption of stationarity of coronal structures as the sun rotates , * the lack of data due to the occulted center of the image , * the nonideal viewing geometry caused by a slight tilt of the sun s axis with respect to the ecliptic .",
    "these shortcomings generally enhance the intrinsic ill - posedness of the tomography problem . the general approach to stabilize",
    "the reconstruction is to smooth the solution by regularization .",
    "the prize to pay is a reduced spatial resolution of the model depending on the quality of the data and inconsistencies and ill - conditioning due to the above effects .",
    "so far only very general , isotropic regularization operators have been applied to coronal density reconstruction problems .",
    "our approach to the density reconstruction in connection with the reconstruction of the coronal magnetic field leads to a new regularization operator which , as we demonstrate by test calculations , could yield a better spatial resolution than conventional reconstructions .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows . in section [ basic ]",
    "we describe the basic equations and the newly developed algorithm of the magnetic field reconstruction program in the case where the plasma density distribution @xmath1 is given .",
    "section [ tests ] contains several test - runs where we apply our code for the reconstruction of analytic mhs - equilibria . in section [ tomoopt ]",
    "we propose an algorithm for an improved reconstruction of @xmath1 if some information of @xmath0 is given .",
    "this approach is tested and compared with conventional methods by with the help of a two dimensional analytic coronal density distribution . in the final section [ conclusions ]",
    "we discuss how both methods could be used together to derive a consistent model of the sun s corona . in appendix",
    "[ appendixa ] , [ appendixb ] and [ appendixc ] we provide the algebra which has been omitted in the text .",
    "we describe the coronal plasma with help of the magnetohydro static ( mhs ) equations .",
    "the mhs equations are @xmath6 where @xmath0 is the magnetic field , @xmath7 the electric current density , @xmath8 the plasma pressure , @xmath9 the plasma density , @xmath10 the vacuum permeability and @xmath11 the solar gravity potential .",
    "we define the functional @xmath12 \\ ; d^3x . \\label{defl}\\ ] ]    the domain @xmath13 is a volume which on one side is bounded by the sun s photosphere .",
    "obviously , @xmath14 is bound from below by @xmath15 .",

    "we assume that the plasma pressure and the density are given .",
    "it is assumed that the corresponding information will be provided by tomographic reconstruction of the solar corona .",

    "we iterate the magnetic field inside the computational box with @xmath21 which ensures that @xmath14 is monotonously decreasing . for the bottom",
    "the boundary values are given by the photospheric vector magnetograph observations .",
    "on other boundaries we may either assume @xmath22 or include the boundary values in the variation .",
    "actually the handling of the not observed lateral and top boundaries of the computational box is similar here as in the nonlinear force - free case @xcite . on the boundary of the computational box",
    "the magnetic field is iterated with @xmath23    we propose to use this iteration process to solve for the minimum of @xmath14 .",
    "if a solution of the mhs - equations for the prescribed boundary condition exist , the global minimum of @xmath14 corresponds to this solution and attains @xmath24 .",
    "please note that the iteration procedure ensures to find this global minimum if the solution space is convex . for a non convex solution space it is possible that the iteration will lead to a local minimum .",
    "for complicated magnetic field configurations it is difficult to decide in advance whether the solution space is convex or not . for a non convex solution space",
    "it is still possible to find the global minimum by iteration if the start configuration is sufficient close ( within a convex area ) to this minimum .",
    "the method generalizes an approach by @xcite which has been used to compute force - free fields .",
    "since analytic truly 3d mhs equilibria are not available , we use an analytic 2d mhs - equilibrium to test the newly developed code .",
    "the analytic equilibria are not meant to be a good representation of the solar corona and the tests are only carried out to check the convergence of the newly developed code .",
    "we represent the magnetic field with help of the flux - function @xmath25 as @xmath26 and the mhs equations reduce to a grad - shafranov equation @xmath27          as a first test we consider equilibria without gravity @xmath28 and choose @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the corresponding grad - shafranov equation is linear in @xmath31 and can be solved analytically by a separation ansatz .",
    "it is convenient to define a function @xmath32 configurations with @xmath33 correspond to potential fields , finite @xmath34 and @xmath35 to force - free equilibria , @xmath36 to equilibria with pressure gradient but without magnetic shear and finally @xmath37 is the general case including both forces and magnetic shear . with this approach",
    "we get the solution of ( [ gse ] ) : @xmath38 \\label{a1},\\ ] ] where @xmath39 .",
    "the solutions of the grad - shafranov equation are invariant in one spatial coordinate ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "to test our 3d - optimization code it would be more convenient to have equilibria varying in all three spatial directions .",
    "we construct such equilibria by rotating the solution of grad shafranov equation by an angle @xmath41 around the z - axis and by @xmath42 around the y - axis . as a result",
    "the solution varies in all of our three coordinate directions .",
    "the final equilibrium has the following free parameters : @xmath43 .",
    "as an example we choose ( @xmath44 for all other @xmath45 , @xmath46 . ) with help of the flux function ( [ a1 ] ) , the equations for the pressure ( [ p1 ] ) , shear field ( [ by1 ] ) and the magnetic field definition ( [ defb ] ) we get the magnetic field * b * and the plasma pressure @xmath8 . for an isothermal plasma",
    "we derive the density as @xmath47 .",
    "we normalize the maximum normal magnetic field at @xmath48 = 0 to 300 gauss = 0.03 t.    as a first test , we want to reconstruct this equilibrium with our code .",
    "the code needs any 3d - vector field as start configuration for the iteration procedure and it is convenient to choose a potential magnetic field with respect to the photospheric line of sight magnetic field .",
    "the potential field can be easily computed for an observed magnetogram . for our model data a potential field",
    "is computed with the same parameter set but @xmath33 .",
    "the boundary values for the iteration are in practical cases only known on the bottom plane . on",
    "the others plans they have to be iterated too using ( [ eq11 ] ) . in this test",
    "we fix the magnetic field however everywhere on the boundary to the value of the analytic solution to simplify the problem . for the force - free case we treated the side and top boundaries as unknowns in @xcite and showed how they can be iteratively determined by ( [ eq11 ] )",
    ". this latter way of treating the boundary values makes the finding of a solution much more difficult .    in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we show three - dimensional plots of selected field lines for this mhs - equilibrium .",
    "the colour coding of the bottom boundary indicates the distribution of @xmath49 on that boundary . to test our code we try to reconstruct that equilibrium in the following way :    * inside the computational box we choose a potential magnetic field as start equilibrium .",
    "* we prescribe the plasma pressure in the box with the analytic solution . *",
    "we prescribe the vector magnetic field on the boundaries of the computational box .",
    "* we iterate for the magnetic field inside the computational box with ( [ iterateb ] ) .    during the computations we calculate the quantities @xmath14 , the absolute value of the force balance @xmath50 ( averaged over the numerical grid ) , the value of @xmath51 ( averaged over the numerical grid ) , and the difference between the numerical magnetic field and the known analytical solution @xmath52 ( averaged over the numerical grid ) at each time step . in figure [ fig2 ]",
    "we show the development of these quantities during the iteration process with logarithmic scaling .",
    "all quantities decrease over several orders of magnitude during the optimization process and reach the level of the discretisation error .",
    "the discretisation error corresponds to the value of @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath51 for the analytic solution computed on a numerical grid . in the upper half of table [ resultstab ]",
    "we summarize the main result of the iteration process .",
    "the first row corresponds to the analytic solution computed on a grid and defines the discretisation error .",
    "the second row contains the values of @xmath14 , the force balance and the relative error for the start configuration , where the interior points have been replaced by a potential field .",
    "the relatively large values of the three quantities are due to the deviation from the equilibrium .",
    "the next rows show how the three diagnostic quantities evolve during the iteration .",
    "after 10000 iteration - steps the discretisation error is reached for all values and the original equilibrium mhs-1 has been reconstructed .",
    "we use a landweber iteration ( see e.g. @xcite ) with some automatic control of the stepsize .",
    "the continuous form of equation ( [ iterateb ] ) ensures a monotonously decreasing @xmath14 .",
    "a monotonously decreasing @xmath14 in the discretized form is ensured if the iteration step @xmath55 is sufficiently small .",
    "the code checks if @xmath56 after each time step and if the condition is not fulfilled , the iteration step is refused and @xmath55 is reduced by a factor of 2 . after each successful iteration step we increase dt slowly by a factor of @xmath57 to allow the time step to become as large as possible with respect to the stability condition . in principle",
    "there are more sophisticated methods available to calculate an effective @xmath55 for each iteration step ( see e.g. @xcite ) but these methods have a huge numerical overhead and further numerical experiments will have to show which of these are favourable for our problem .",

    "the major improvement comes from the region close to the occulter . in this region conventional tomography",
