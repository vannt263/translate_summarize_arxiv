    "lep1 precision data represent a step of paramount relevance in probing extensions of the standard model ( sm ) . through their virtual effects ,",
    "the electroweak radiative corrections `` feel '' the presence of new particles running in the loops and the level of accuracy on the relevant observables is such that this set of tests is complementary to the traditional probes on virtual effects due to new physics ( i.e. highly suppressed or forbidden flavour changing neutral current phenomena ) . in some cases",
    ", as that which we aim to discuss here , the electroweak precision tests represent the only indirect way to search for these new particles .    we will discuss electroweak radiative effects from extensions of the ordinary fermionic spectrum of the sm .",
    "the new fermions are supposed to possess the same colour and electroweak quantum numbers as the ordinary ones and to mix very tinily with the ordinary three generations .",
    "the most straightforward realization of such a fermionic extension of the sm is the introduction of a fourth generation of fermions .",
    "this possibility has been almost entirely jeopardized by the lep1 bound on the numbers of neutrinos species .",
    "although there still exists the obvious way out of having new fermion generations with heavy neutrinos , we think that these options are awkward enough not to deserve further studies .",
    "rather , what we have in mind in tackling this problem are general frames discussing new physics beyond the sm which lead to new quarks and/or leptons classified in the usual chiral way with iso - doublets and iso - singolets for different chiralities . situations of this kind may be encountered in grand unified schemes where the ordinary fifteen weyl spinors of each fermionic generation are only part of larger representations or where new fermions ( possibly also mirror fermions ) are requested by the group or manifold structure of the schemes .",
    "chiral fermions with heavy static masses may also provide a first approximation of virtual effects in techicolor - like schemes when the dynamical behaviour of technifermion self - energies are neglected .",
    "although such effects have been extensively investigated in the literature @xcite , our presentation focuses mainly on two aspects , which have been only partially touched in the previous analyses : the use of effective lagrangians for a model - independent treatment of the problem and a discussion of the validity of this approach in comparison with the computation in the full - fledged theory .",
    "while separate tests can be set up for each different extension of the sm , there may be some advantage in realizing this analysis in a model independent framework .",
    "the natural theoretical tool to this purpose is represented by an effective electroweak lagrangian where , giving up the renormalizability requirement , all @xmath5 invariant operators up to a given dimension are present with unknown coefficients , to be eventually determined from the experiments .",
    "each different model fixes uniquely this set of coefficients and the effective lagrangian becomes in this way a common ground to discuss and compare several sm extensions .",
    "the introduction of the well known @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite or @xmath9 s @xcite variables was much in the same spirit and the use of an effective lagrangian represents in a sense the natural extension of these approaches ( section 2 ) .",
    "we derive ( section 3 ) some constrains on new chiral doublets , from latest avaible values of the @xmath9 s data , in the effective lagrangians approximation and in the full one - loop computation , putting on evidence that deviations are sizeable ( compared with experimental errors ) only for fermion masses close to the @xmath0 threshold . some of the constraints on new sequential fermions coming from @xmath10 accelerator results are also presented .",
    "but lep1 analysis is not important only for studying the existence of new physics in the bilinear sector .",
    "also trilinear coupling are severely constrained by the presence of observed bilinear effects at lep1-slc . to avoid ambiguities in the forms factor definitions at one loop level , we present an analysis of new chiral fermions effects on @xmath11 differential cross - section . here",
    "it will be evident that the delay s of unitarity effects makes higher energies collider ( @xmath12 gev , or @xmath13 gev , much more sensitive than lep2 to this kind of new physics effects ( section 4 ) .",
    "the use of an effective lagrangian for the electroweak physics has been originally advocated for the study of the large higgs mass limit in the sm @xcite .",
    "subsequently , contributions from chiral @xmath14 doublets have been considered in the degenerate case @xcite , for small splitting @xcite and in the case of infinite splitting @xcite . in the present note",
    "we will deal with the general case of arbitrary splitting among the fermions in the doublet @xcite .    here ,",
    "for completeness , we consider the standard list of @xmath5 cp conserving operators containing up to four derivatives and built out of the gauge vector bosons @xmath15 and the would be goldstone bosons @xmath16 @xcite : _ 0&=&[tr(tv_)]^2 + _ 1&=&ib_tr(tw^ ) + _ 2&=&ib_tr(t[v^,v^ ] ) + _",

    "if at least one of the two masses is small , this causes a substantial deviation from the asymptotic , effective lagrangian prediction .",
    "in particular , as it was observed in @xcite , a large negative contribution to both @xmath53 and @xmath54 is now possible , due to a formal divergence of @xmath74 at the threshold which produces a large and positive @xmath75 .",
    "clearly , this behaviour can not be reproduced by @xmath35 , which , at the fourth order in derivatives , automatically sets @xmath76 .",

    "here we fix one of the masses to @xmath77 gev and let the other vary from @xmath77 gev to @xmath78 gev . as before the top and higgs masses has been fixed to @xmath79 gev and @xmath80 gev .",
    "as expected , it appears that only a small amount of splitting among the doublet components is allowed . for the chosen value of @xmath81 and @xmath82 ,",

    "if one also includes the sld determination of the left - right asymmetry , then one gets the lower ellipsis .",
    "a relevant question is , then , when the asymptotical regime starts , i.e. how close to @xmath83 should be the masses of the new quarks or leptons for observing deviations due to the full expression of @xmath84 instead of the truncated expression given in eq .",

    "a detailed analysis shows that already for masses of the new fermions above @xmath85 gev the difference between the values of the @xmath36 obtained with the truncated and full expression of @xmath84 are as small as @xmath86 , i.e. below the present experimental level of accuracy .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.2 where the asymptotical ( full line ) and full one loop ( dashed and dotted ) expression of @xmath54 are compared as a function of @xmath50 .    beyond the indirect precision tests , the possibility of having new fermions carrying the usual @xmath87 quantum numbers",
    "can clearly also be bounded by the direct searches . concerning the present searches , from lep1 we have the lower bound of @xmath0 to @xmath88 gev . ] which applies independently from any assumption on the decay modes of the new fermions which couple to the @xmath66 boson .",
    "much stronger limits on the new quark masses can be inferred from the tevatron results . however , as we know from the search for the top quark , these latter bounds rely on assumptions concerning the decay modes of the heavy quark .",
    "for instance , in the case of the top search it was stressed that if a new decay channel into the @xmath89 quark and a charged higgs were avaible to the top , then one could not use the cdf bounds on @xmath90 @xcite which came along these last years , before the final discovery of the top quark .",
    "now , it may be conceivable that the new physics related to the presence of extra - fermions can also affect their possible decay channels making the lightest of the new fermions unstable . indeed , we stated in our assumption that the new fermions do not essentially mix with the ordinary ones , hence one has to invoke new physics if one wants to avoid the formation of stable heavy mesons made out of the lightest stable new fermion and of the ordinary fermions of the standard model .",
    "if the new fermions can decay within the detector , then the bounds on their masses , coming from tevatron data , must be discussed in a model - dependent way and even the case of new quarks with masses lighter than @xmath90 are not fully ruled out .",
    "if on the contrary the lightest new quark is stable , then searches for exotic heavy meson at cdf already ruled out the possibility of being near the threshold @xmath0 .",
    "the existence of coloured particle with charge @xmath91 is strictly bounded over @xmath92 from cdf experiment @xcite . finally , note that for charged leptons the bound coming from cdf are much less stringent .",
    "a new stable charged lepton of mass of @xmath93 can not be ruled out .",
    "if new physics beyond the sm were modeled by additional heavy chiral fermions , of the kind we have considered , then we could draw informations on the searches , at future colliders , of anomalous trilinear gauge boson couplings of the @xmath94 vertex ( where @xmath95 stands for neutral vector boson ) .",
    "we define the kinematics of the @xmath94 vertex as v(p , v_1 ) w^-(q , v_2 ) + w^+(|q , v_3 )  , where @xmath96 are the momenta of @xmath97 respectively , and @xmath98 are their polarization vectors . for simplicity we can impose the produced @xmath99 to be on shell ,",
