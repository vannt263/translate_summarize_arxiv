    "numerical studies @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite have shown that , in case of non - adhesive contacts , when an elastic body is brought into contact with a rough surface the true contact area increases proportionally to the applied load .",
    "to predict such a behavior two main approaches have been developed : ( i ) multiasperity contact theories ( originally formulated by greenwood and williamson ( gw ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) where the contact between the surfaces is modelled as an ensemble of randomly distributed hertzian contacts between the asperities , and ( ii ) persson s theory of contact mechanics @xcite , @xcite where the probability distribution of the contact pressure is shown to be governed by a diffusive process as the magnification at which we observe the interface is increased .",
    "the scientific community is debating about which theory gives the most accurate results . in a previous paper @xcite  one of the authors ( g.c . )",
    "has shown that gw - type theories predict linearity only for vanishingly small contact areas and load , whereas as the load is increased the theoretical predictions rapidly deviate from the asymptotic linearity .",
    "this behavior has been shown not to be followed by persson s theory , which predicts linearity between contact area and load up to values of about 15 - 20% of nominal contact area , in agreement with some experimental and numerical results .",
    "numerical calculations by campa et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that hertzian - type regime , which is the basis on which gw and similar theories have been developed , occurs only at relatively small loads , thus indicating the inadequacy of gw - type theories at higher loads .",
    "as already observed the original version of persson s theory describes the interfacial contact pressure through a parabolic partial differential equation where the diffusivity term is calculated under the approximation that the power spectral density ( psd )  of the elastically deformed surfaces is equal to the psd of the underlying rough surfaces @xcite , @xcite , i.e. assuming that the diffusive term that one would obtain in case of full - contact conditions remains exactly the same also in case of partial contact conditions .",
    "the stored elastic energy ( or , in case of sliding of viscoelastic solids , the friction coefficient ) is , instead , calculated assuming that the psd of the deformed surface is the product of the psd  of the underlying rough surface times the fraction of contact area at the given resolution .",
    "this , in particular , can be shown to be coherently derived by the theory itself , see ref . @xcite . of course in full contact conditions",
    "persson s theory is exact , but in case of partial contact it has to be possibly verified .",
    "for this reason , there is not yet a clear evidence about the correctness of the factor of proportionality between contact area and load predicted by persson s theory .",
    "indeed , there are numerical investigations @xcite , @xcite of non - adhesive contacts between rough surfaces , which show that persson s theory underestimates the contact area , although its main qualitative prediction seems in very good agreement with numerical calculations , as proved in ref .",
    "@xcite , where green function molecular dynamics ( gfmd ) numerical calculations have been employed to show that the psd of the deformed surface has the same power law exponent as predicted by persson s theory @xcite    in this paper the authors make an attempt to give an additional contribution in this direction .",
    "we extend the analysis to include adhesive interactions at the interface of the contacting bodies , which become more and more important as the length scale of observation is decreased and may dominate the contact behavior of micro- and nano - mechanical and biomechanical systems .",
    "we indeed focus on the adhesive contact between a semi - infinite half space and a randomly rough surface with roughness in only one direction , and compare our numerical predictions with the results of persson s theory .",
    "we observe that the original version of persson s theory @xcite , @xcite was conceived to deal with isotropic surfaces , but in our case the surfaces is strongly anisotropic , being rough only in one direction .",
    "therefore , in order to compare theoretical and numerically calculated data we have employed an extended version of persson s theory @xcite , which is able to handle anisotropic surfaces as in the case of 1d rough surfaces .",
    "there are mainly two reasons for studying a 1d rough surface : ( i ) first of all one should consider that surface roughness is characterized by a large number of length scales , which can cover 3 - 4 decades and even more .",
    "therefore , in order to get physically meaningful results , one needs to include all the spectral components of the surface roughness in the analysis .",
    "however , increasing the number of length scales rapidly increases the number of points where the numerical solution has to be sought , and , in turn , the computation time .",
    "this problem is strongly reduced in case of 1d roughness so that one can include in the analysis more than 3 decades of length scales ; ( ii ) secondly we must also observe that rough surfaces , encountered in many practical applications , are often strongly anisotropic mainly as a result of machining and surface treatments ( e.g. unidirectional polished surface which present wear tracks along the polishing direction , although the resulting roughness is not strictly 1d ) .",
    "thus , from a practical point of view , it is also very important to test persson s theoretical prediction for anisotropic surfaces .    in the last years",
    "scientists have been developing _ ad hoc _ numerical methods to treat the problem of contact mechanics between randomly rough surfaces .",
    "here we would like to recall the methodology proposed by robbins and co - workers @xcite , who developed a coarse - graining fem ( cgfem ) approach , and that conceived by campa and mser @xcite , who have developed a green s function molecular dynamics ( gfmd ) approach to deal with such a problem . here",
    "we employ a different methodology to deal with adhesive contact .",
    "the methodology , already presented by one of us in ref .",
    "@xcite , is based on a pure continuum mechanics approach and belongs to the class of boundary element methods ( bem ) , since it also makes use of green s function to solve the problem .",
    "this allows us to reduced the problem to fredholm integral equation of the first kind with a logarithmic kernel .",
    "we stress that the position of the edges of each contact patch is not known _ a priori _ and must be determined by requiring that the total energy of the system is stationary , i.e. we are dealing with a free - boundary problem .",
    "the numerical procedure has been designed in such a way to never loose resolution even when the single contact spot is below the smallest length scale of observation .",
    "we show also that the numerical complexity of the problem can be strongly reduced since the thermodynamic state of the system only depends on the size of each contact area and on the pressure distribution in the contact area .",
    "thus , in our boundary element approach , only the contact patches need to be discretized ( we use an _ ad hoc _ adaptive grid ) and the solution of the fredholm equation , which is obtained by means of matrix inversion , has to be determined only for a limited number of points , i.e. only those belonging to the true contact area .",
    "we consider a periodic contact as shown in figure 1 where an elastic layer of thickness @xmath0 is interposed between a flat rigid plate ( upper surface ) and a periodically rough rigid substrate with wavelength @xmath1 ( bottom surface ) .",
    "we assume that the rough surface has roughness in only one direction and is smooth in the orthogonal direction . under these conditions",
    "the problem at hand is a periodic plane problem , i.e. the stress , displacement and strain fields only depends on the @xmath2 and @xmath3 coordinates shown in fig . 2 and are periodic functions of period @xmath1 .",
    "2 shows , in particular , the total displacement @xmath4 of the substrate , the average displacement @xmath5 of boundary of the deformed layer and the penetration @xmath6 of the rigid substrate into the elastic slab .",
    "these three quantities are shown to satisfy the following relation@xmath7    we will focus on the pressure distribution @xmath8 and the displacement @xmath9 of the elastic solid at the interface . in refs . @xcite and @xcite g.c .",

    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 are the young modulus and the poisson ratio of the elastic layer . in eq .",
    "( [ integral equation ] ) and the quantity @xmath25 represents the heights of the rough profile measured from its mean plane . since we are considering a periodic problem @xmath25 can be written as fourier series@xmath26 where the fundamental wave vector is @xmath27 .",
    "also we have defined in eq .",
    "( [ integral equation ] ) the quantity @xmath28   $ ] , which is the maximum height of the substrate roughness .",

    "this is the same as requiring that @xmath34 the interfacial energy ( see ref .",

    "the reader is referred to ref .",
    "@xcite , here we just describe some numerical techniques which are peculiar to the problem we discuss in this paper .",
    "let us assume that we know the solution of eqs .",
    "( [ closure equation ] ) for a given penetration @xmath6 : the knowledge of the contact region @xmath40 $ ] is sufficient to fully characterize the system .",
    "( [ integral equation ] ) determines the stress @xmath41 ; we solve it iteratively , through the gauss - seidel algorithm .",
    "special care has been taken to guarantee stability and accuracy of the solution by choosing a suitable sampling grid : the domain @xmath10 is discretized in a non - uniform , adaptive way , so to ensure that more points are employed close to the edges of the contacts , where the stress distribution , because of adhesion , presents a square root singularity .",
    "as long as the stress is known , the deformed profile of the elastic layer follows from eq .",
    "( [ fundsol ] ) .",
    "the interfacial energy is then given by eqs .",
    "( [ interfacial energy ] ) , ( [ interfacial elastic energy ] ) and ( [ adhesion energy general ] ) .    in summary , at a low level in our numerical implementation of the algorithm there is the _ solver _ , a software code that , given the penetration and the contact regions , calculates everything else . on top of it we built another piece of software in charge to adjust the position of the contacts boundaries @xmath42 so to minimize the interfacial energy .",
    "we employed a conjugate gradient method in the version given by polak and ribire @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the problem is more complex than a minimization in a @xmath43-dimensional space .",
    "starting form an arbitrary configuration , some of the contact boundaries can acquire the same value , meaning that either a contact is detaching or two contacts are coalescing together into a single bigger one .",
    "if this happens , the minimization has to be restarted in a different number of dimensions .",
    "furthermore , a constraint must be accounted : in principle we can determine the configuration corresponding to any penetration and contacts , but we must impose that in the non - contact regions the elastic layer never intersects the substrate .",
    "for instance , if we consider a physical configuration minimizing the interfacial energy , and then we increase the penetration pushing the substrate against the elastic layer , the starting point for the new conjugate gradient minimization may show an intersection between the elastic layer and some peaks of the substrate in the non - contact regions .",
    "this indicates that a new contact has to be added before starting the minimization .",
    "a specific procedure inside our software is in charge to detect all the intersections between elastic layer and substrate , so to enforce the physical constraints of the problem .",
    "given the penetration @xmath6 , the search of the contact domain @xmath10 that minimizes the interfacial energy is challenging : not only the @xmath43 variables @xmath44 are unknown , but also the number @xmath45 of contact regions is unknown !",
    "the solution of the problem resorts to conjugate gradient minimization alternated to searches for intersections between the elastic layer and the block .",
    "the minimization procedure stops when the conjugate gradient ends successfully , i.e.  it is not interrupted by a coalescence of detachment of contacts , and the successive search for intersections confirms that there are no intersections in the non - contact regions .",
    "although we took special care to guarantee that the minimization procedure would converge for moderately large variations of penetration , we observed that the most reliable approach involves many small increments of penetration starting from 0 ( non - contact ) up to desired value , while optimizing of the solution at every intermediate step .",
    "the solution of the contact problem in presence of adhesion is not unique , that is , for the same penetration more configurations are possible depending on the loading history .",
    "nonetheless the contact pattern occurring with increasing penetration is uniquely identified and it is the most suitable solution to represent the non - adhesive contact in the limit of vanishingly small adhesive bonds . as a final remark , we observe that this algorithm can not be used to solve the problem without adhesion : in this case the solution is still a stationary point satisfying eq .",
    "( [ closure equation ] ) , but the profile of the elastic layer in the non - contact regions is always tangent to the substrate near the crack tips @xmath13 and @xmath14 . an infinitesimal motion of any of the crack points decreasing the contact region would cause an intersection between elastic layer and substrate . in other terms",
    ", the solution lies always on the boundary of the subset of @xmath46 identified by the physical constraint of non - intersection .",
    "the solution would not be a minimum without such a constraint .",
    "the aim of this paper is to compare the numerical results with analytical predictions of one of the most promising and also strongly debated theory of contact mechanics , i.e. the recent theory by persson @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , the surface we are considering is strongly anisotropic , in fact it is rough in only one direction and smooth in the orthogonal direction .",
    "the original theory proposed by persson was , instead , conceived and developed for perfectly isotropic surfaces . therefore in order to carry out the analysis we need to extend this theory to the case of anisotropic surfaces .",
    "this extension has been obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we briefly summarize the main equations .",

    "the calculation of the elastic energy @xmath72 must take into account that because of partial contact conditions the elastic energy stored at the interface is less than what would be stored in case of full - contact conditions .",
    "this is necessarily true because only where contact occurs the elastic solid conforms the underlying substrate , whereas outside of the contact regions the elastic surface is much less deformed .",

    "the same effect has also been observed in molecular dynamics calculations @xcite .",
    "the explanation for this behavior is that numerical calculations have been carried out for a finite system , whereas persson s theory is for an infinite system .",
    "indeed an infinite system has many ( arbitrarily ) high asperities , which always allows the contact between the two solids to occur for arbitrarily large surface separations .",
    "but a finite system has asperities with height below some finite length @xmath159 , and for @xmath160 no contact occurs between the solids and @xmath161 . fig .",
    "[ fig_pdf ] shows the probability density function @xmath162 of interfacial normal stress distribution @xmath163 at the highest magnification .",
    "we observe that persson s predictions and numerical data agree only at a qualitative level , but strongly deviates from a quantitative point of view .",
    "the reason of this quantitative disagreement can be easily understood if one recalls eq .",
    "( [ contact area general ] ) which states that the integral of the @xmath162 must be proportional to the true contact area @xmath164 and considers that persson s theory predicts a contact area smaller by a factor @xmath165 , if compared to numerical calculations .",
    "we also present with solid lines the best fit obtained with the double gaussian distribution @xmath166   \\label{final double gaussian}\\ ] ] where we have relaxed the quantities @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "[ fig_pdf ] and even more [ fig .",
    "pdf - log ] show that , at least when the amount of adhesion energy is small ( as in our case ) , eq .",
    "( [ final double gaussian ] ) is a good approximation of the numerically calculated stress probability function @xmath169 .",
    "indeed fig .",
    "pdf - log ] shows that , at high values of @xmath56 , the tail of the stress probability density function is gaussian .",
    "notice that , the tail of numerically calculated stress probability distribution at negative loads is an effect of the adhesion interaction which has been introduced only through the surface energy , namely by means of an interaction force with an infinitesimally short range .",
    "this even allows that infinite negative values of @xmath56 can occur at the interface .",
    "we also observe that the value of @xmath167 calculated by fitting the interfacial stress probability density function differs from that calculated in the spirit of persson s theory through eq .",
    "( [ apparent traction stress ] ) .",
    "however , it is possible to show that a better estimation of the tensile stress @xmath167 , can be obtained by assuming in eq .",
    "( [ apparent traction stress ] ) that the width of the detached region is a factor 1/2 smaller than that originally assumed in persson s theory @xcite .",
    "in such a case the estimated tensile stress @xmath167 would increase of roughly a factor 1.4 thus making @xmath167 closer to the value we have found in fig . [ fig_pdf ] .",
    "the authors have carried out detailed numerical calculations to determine the contact area , the stress distribution , the penetration and elastic deformation of an infinitely thick layer in adhesive contact with a rough strongly anisotropic rigid surface .",
    "the numerical predictions have been compared in detail with those of an extended version of persson s theory able to deal with adhesive contact between anisotropic rough surfaces .",
    "it is shown that , for any given load , the value of true contact area predicted by persson s theory significantly differs from the numerically calculated ones , the first being smaller by a factor @xmath165 .",
    "this may also depend on the fact the persson s theory is of the mean - field type and , therefore , should work well in higher dimensions than in 1d .",
    "however , the predicted value of separation matches almost perfectly the numerical data .",
    "we have also compared the power spectral density of the deformed elastic surface and of the stress distribution at the interface as obtained by numerical calculations and persson s theory .",
    "we observe that both theory and numerical calculations predict the psds to follow a power law with almost the same exponents .",
    "this extends to the case of adhesive contact , what has been found previously for adhesionless contact by other authors .",
    "however , we also observe , in agreement with persson s theory of adhesive contact , that at high magnification the exponent of the power law changes in such a way to suggest that the elastic solid lies in full contact condition with the fine microstructure of the rough surfaces .",
    "we conclude that , persson s theory is able to capture the main physics behind contact mechanics of rough surfaces independently of whether adhesion is present or not .",
    "however , we also observe that from an engineering point of view a better estimation of the contact area would be very useful in practical applications as in case tires , mixed lubricated interfaces , and seals , where the kinetic friction or the amount of leakage should be accurately predicted for design purposes .",
    "therefore an improvement of the theory , which allows to better estimate the real contact area , would be strongly appreciated by engineering community ."
