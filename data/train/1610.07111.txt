    "the first experimental verification of the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) @xcite occurred more then seven decades after its theoretical prediction @xcite , and a great deal of progress has been in the theoretical and experimental study of this many body physical phenomenon @xcite . in this direction",
    "the algebraic bethe ansatz method has been used to solve and study models that may describe bec @xcite . the quantum phase transitions and classical analysis of some of these models",
    "have been studied in @xcite .",
    "we are considering here a generalized issue of the two - sites bose - hubbard model , also known as the _ canonical josephson hamiltonian _ @xcite , that has been an useful model in understanding tunnelling phenomena using two bec @xcite .",
    "the model that we will study is more general that the model @xcite in the sense that we introduce the on - well energies and asymmetric tunnelling .",
    "here we will discuss its integrability and exact solution .",
    "the generalized model is described by the hamiltonian @xmath4 where , @xmath5 , denote the single - particle creation ( annihilation ) operators and @xmath6 are the corresponding boson number operators in each condensate .",
    "the boson operator total number of particles , @xmath7 , is a conserved quantity , @xmath8=0 $ ] .",
    "the couplings @xmath9 , with @xmath10 , provides the interaction strength between the bosons and they are proportional to the @xmath11-wave scattering length , @xmath12 are the amplitude of tunnelling , @xmath13 are the external potentials and @xmath14 are the on - well energies per particle , with @xmath15 the kinetic energies in each condensate .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) is invariant under the discrete @xmath16 mirror transformation , @xmath17 , and under the global @xmath18 gauge transformation , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is an arbitrary @xmath21-number and , @xmath22 .",
    "for @xmath23 we get again the @xmath16 symmetry .    for the particular choice of the couplings parameters we can get some hamiltonians , as for example by the choices @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 we get the canonical josephson hamiltonian studied in @xcite .",
    "the case with @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 was used to study the interplay between disorder and interaction @xcite .",
    "for these models we have symmetric tunnelling if @xmath33 and when we turn on @xmath34 we break the symmetry . for the symmetric case we also can put @xmath35 and change the deep of both wells at the same time . in the antisymmetric case @xmath36 we have asymmetric tunnelling with the bias of one well increasing the on - well energy . in this case",
    "it is called a tilted two - wells potential @xcite and an experimental set up was made to study the distillation of a bose - einstein condensate , providing a model system for metastability in condensates , a test for quantum kinetic theories of condensate formation @xcite and atomtronic devices @xcite .",
    "the on - well energies is determined by the internal states of the atoms in the condensates and/or by the kinetic ( thermal ) energy of the atoms .    in the fig .",
    "[ tw ] we represent the two bec by a two - wells potential for the case @xmath37 and @xmath38 , with asymmetric tunnelling @xmath39 .",
    "the tunnelling amplitudes @xmath12 are related to the barrier height @xmath40 @xcite .    , @xmath38 and barrier height @xmath40 .",
    "the spectrum of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) , with @xmath41 and symmetric tunnelling , has been appeared in different papers @xcite and the bethe states in @xcite . to be complete",
    "i will shortly describe the algebraic bethe ansatz method @xcite and present the exact solution for the general case of @xmath42 and asymmetric tunnelling @xmath39 .",
    "we begin with the @xmath0-invariant @xmath1-matrix , depending on the spectral parameter @xmath43 ,    @xmath44    with @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 . above",
    ", @xmath48 is an arbitrary parameter , to be chosen later .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath49 satisfies the yang - baxter equation    @xmath50    where @xmath51 denotes the matrix acting non - trivially on the @xmath52-th and the @xmath53-th spaces and as the identity on the remaining space .",
    "next we define the monodromy matrix @xmath54 ,    @xmath55    such that the yang - baxter algebra is satisfied    @xmath56    in what follows we will choose a realization for the monodromy matrix @xmath57 to obtain a solution for the two - sites bec model ( [ ham ] ) . in this construction ,",

    "another consequence is that the coefficients @xmath63 in the transfer matrix @xmath64 ,    @xmath65    are conserved quantities or simply @xmath21-numbers , with    @xmath66 = 0 , \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\forall \\;j,\\;k.\\ ] ]    if the transfer matrix @xmath64 is a polynomial function in @xmath43 , with @xmath67 , it is easy to see that ,    @xmath68    we are using a new solution of the equation ( [ rll ] ) , a new parametrization of a well known @xcite lax operator ,    @xmath69    for the boson operators @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 and with @xmath73 . the parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 are arbitrary .",
