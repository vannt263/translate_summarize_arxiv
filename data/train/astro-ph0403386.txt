    "the discovery of the extrasolar planets is opening a new world beyond our solar system .",
    "ever since 1995 , mayor & queloz ( 1995 ) detected the first extrasolar giant jupiter51 peg , and to date there are more than 100 planetary systems discovered(marcy , cochran , & mayor 2000 ; butler et al .",
    "2003 ) using the radial velocity technique in the surveys of nearby young stars . at the time of writing ,",
    "a dozen of multiple planet systems ",
    "hd 82943 , gj 876 , hd 168443 , hd 74156 , 47 uma , hd 37124 , hd 38529 , hd 12661 , 55 cnc , @xmath19 and ( fischer et al . 2003 ) , hd 169830 ( mayor et al . 2004 ) and hd 160691 ( jones et al .",
    "2002 ) were discovered in recent years and this number is undoubtedly cumulative as the measurements are being carried on .",
    "hence , it is necessary to categorize the discovered multiple planetary systems according to their statistical characteristics ( such as the distribution of the planetary masses , semi - major axes , eccentricities and metallicity ) ( marcy et al .",
    "2003 ) , then to study the correlation between mass ratio and period ratio ( mazeh & zucker 2003 ) and further to improve the understanding of the relationship between the planet occurrence rate and stellar metallicity ( santos et al . 2003",
    "; fischer , valenti , & marcy 2004 ) .",
    "the other key point is to investigate possible stable configurations for the multiple systems , in which the observations reveal that most of them are typically characterized by mean motion resonance ( mmr ) and ( or ) apsidal phase - locking between their orbiting companions ( fischer et al .",
    "2003 ; ji et al . 2003a",
    "; lee & peale 2003 ) , so that one can better understand the full dynamics of these systems . in the present study",
    ", we mainly focus our attention on the hd 82943 system .    as of april 4 , 2001 , the geneva extrasolar planet search teamudry / planet / hd82943syst.html ] announced the discovery of the hd 82943 planetary system at an eso press release , consisting of two jupiter - like planets orbiting the parent star .",
    "subsequently , israelian et al . ( 2001 , 2003 ) reported the discovery of @xmath20li in the atmosphere of this metal - rich solar - type star and indicated that the presence of @xmath20li can probably be shown as evidence for a planet or planets having been engulfed by the star hd82943 . at first , let us review several stellar features for this star : hd 82943 is a g0 star with @xmath21 , hipparcos parallax of 36.42 mas , distance of 27.46 pc , and [ fe / h ] = @xmath22 ( santos et al .",
    "2001 , 2003 ) .",
    "the star is aged 2.9 gyr with the stellar mass of 1.15 @xmath23 .",
    "similar to the gj 876 system ( marcy et al .",
    "2001 ) , which is believed that stability of the planetary system might be sustained by the 2:1 mean - motion resonance ( mmr ) and apsidal alignment in the semi - major axes ( kinoshita & nakai 2001 ; lee & peale 2002 ; ji , li , & liu 2002 ) , the two planets of hd 82943 are now also close to a 2:1 commensurability , with orbital periods @xmath24 and @xmath25 d , and semi - major axes 1.18 and 0.75au ( mayor et al . 2004 ) .",
    "however , the previous investigations ( gozdziewski & maciejewski 2001 ) of the stability of the hd 82943 system showed that the system given by the earlier best - fit orbital solution was extremely unstable due to the strong interaction of two massive planets with high eccentricities , hence a natural question is that whether the two companions for this system are really in a 2:1 orbital resonance and whether the system is secularly stable with the observed best - fit orbital parameters . additionally , the stability for hd 82943 places constraints on both planetary masses  if the mass of the outer companion is smaller than that of the inner planet ( hadjidemetriou 2002 ) , a system that harbors two planets moving on elliptic 2:1 resonant periodic orbits will be destabilized as a finale . nevertheless , the recently updated orbital solutions ( mayor et al .",
    "2004 ) , with more abundant observations as of october 13 , 2003 , show that the inner planet is a bit more massive than the outer one , thus it is indeed noteworthy to thoroughly reanalyze the observed hd 82943 system , still these mentioned issues of this fascinating system are to arouse our great interests and inspire us to seek after the answers .",
    "consequently , our first goal is to carefully explore the system to fully understand in what kind of likely configurations that two companions may orbit about their host star and if exist , to reveal the dynamical mechanisms to remain the system .    in a viewpoint of celestial mechanics ,",
    "the former studies are concerned for the dynamical analysis for the global stability of the exosystems ( gozdziewski & maciejewski 2001 , 2003 ; ji et al .",
    "2002 ; kiseleva - eggleton et al .",
    "2002 ; barnes & quinn 2004 ) , the investigations of resonant picture in the phase space ( hadjidemetriou 2002 ; ji et al . 2003a",
    "; haghighipour et al . 2003 ; callegari jr . , michtchenko , & ferraz - mello 2004 ) or chaotic behavior ( jiang & yeh 2004 ) in these systems , and the existence of habitable zones ( hz ) for earth - like planets that supply stable liquid - water environment to cultivate extraterrestrial intelligent beings ( kasting , whitmore , & reynolds 1993 ; jones & sleep 2002 ; laughlin , chambers , & fischer 2002 ; dvorak et al . 2003 ; menou & tabachnik 2003 ) .",
    "other recent works on the 2:1 resonant geometry of the extrasolar planetary systems include those by hadjidemetriou & psychoyos ( 2003 ) , beauge , ferraz - mello , & michtchenko ( 2003 ) and lee ( 2004 ) .",
    "they studied the presence and location of stable equilibrium solutions or dynamical evolution of such exosystems in more general way . in this work",
    ", we revisit the dynamics of the hd 82943 system and outline several possible stable configurations for a system harboring two companions in a 2:1 resonance , and our new findings are that this system can be locked in aligned or antialigned orbital motions , which these results are never presented nor analyzed in other studies .",
    "specifically , at first , we introduce the numerical setup ( see  2 ) for the dynamical simulations . in  3 , we make a study of the various planetary configurations for hd 82943 by means of the semi - analytical treatment and direct integrations over long - term orbital evolution .",
    "we present the numerical results of hd 82943 by employing two series of the best - fit orbital solutions , and we discover three kinds of stable planetary geometry for this system that all are linked to a 2:1 resonance . furthermore , we advance a semi - analytical model that can avoid the difficulties in the perturbation expansions for the larger eccentricities and still help to explain the numerical evolutions . still , we investigate how the stability for the resonant topology depends on the planetary mass ratio and the orbital parameters on the basis of the new fit ( mayor et al .",
    "2004 ) . in  4 ,",
    "we explore whether there exist an earth - like planet surviving about the habitable zones for the authentic systems of hd 82943 and gj 876 .    the other extraordinary phenomenon in the exosystems",
    "is that many of them can host giant jupiter - like planets with strikingly larger eccentricities , and in figure 1 is shown the distribution of the eccentricities of 111 planets discovered at present day .",
    "the figure exhibits that more than 50% of the planets have the eccentricities larger than 0.30 , and hd 80606 b ( naef et al . 2001 ) can occupy the eccentricity amounting up to 0.93 , which indicates that such unusual discoveries are quite different from the circumstances in our solar system , where most of the major planets revolve around sun on the near - circular orbits .",
    "in addition , from the view of the observations , the larger eccentricities seem to favor the planet detectability , where the semi - amplitude of wobble velocity @xmath26 ( with @xmath27 ) , herein @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are , respectively , the stellar mass , the planetary mass , the orbital semi - major axis , the eccentricity and the inclination of the orbit relative to the sky plane , requires more massive planetary mass ( @xmath33 the order of jupiter s mass ) , a lower @xmath30 ( e.g. , close - in giant planets ) and a higher @xmath31 ( see fig .",
    "moreover , many previous authors have put forward diverse theories and possible mechanisms to interpret the evolution and origin of the orbital eccentricity variation in the exosystems : the disk - planet or planet - planet interaction ( goldreich & tremaine 1980 ; weidenschilling & marzari 1996 ; lin & ida 1997 ; ford , rasio , & sills 1999 ) render the orbital migration of gas giant planets embedded in the protoplanetary systems ( lin , bodenheimer , & richardson 1996 ; ward 1997 ; bryden et al .",
    "2000 ; nelson et al .",
    "2000 ) and the eccentricities are usually believed to excite to the observed values through complicated processes ( snellgrove , papaloizou , & nelson 2001 ; kley 2003 ) or hybrid mechanisms ( lee & peale 2002 ; chiang , fischer , & thommes 2002 ) related to both the planetary migration and the resonant capture . therefore , as a second objective , we intend to preliminarily make a discussion of the possible origin of the eccentricities or resonant configurations ( see  5 ) for two planets of hd 82943 .",
    "as a final part , in  6 , we summarize our principal results and give a brief discussion .",
    "in the present work , we aim to numerically investigate the orbital motions for the two companions for hd 82943 in a three - dimensional space . and",
    "at first , let us bear in mind that the two companions of this system are assumed to be in the same orbital plane for our simulations except where noted .",
    "here we adopt the best - fit orbital parameters from the web site of the geneva team .",
    "as is known , the two - kepler fit produce five parameters set-(@xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) , where for each planet @xmath39 , are the amplitude @xmath34 , the orbital period @xmath35 , the eccentricity @xmath36 , the argument of periapse @xmath37 and the time of periapse passage @xmath38 .",
    "the geneva team presented two sets of the orbital data and hereafter we respectively call them fit 1 and fit 2 . here for fit 1 of 107 observations ( as of july 31 , 2002 ) with the residual of 7.4 m / s , the data are listed here : @xmath40 @xmath41 , @xmath42 @xmath41 , @xmath43 au , @xmath44 au , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where hereafter the subscripts 1 and 2 denote the inner and outer planets , respectively . and fit 2 were derived by fitting 142 observations ( as of october 13 , 2003 , see also mayor et al . 2004 ) with the residual of 6.8 m / s ,",
    "the orbital parameters are presented : @xmath49 @xmath41 , @xmath50 @xmath41 , @xmath51 au , @xmath52 au , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 . apparently , the eccentricities , semi - major axes , periapse arguments , true anomalies and others can act as key factors to determine the shape of the radial velocity curves .",
    "however , due to the large interaction between two planets in a low mean motion resonance , laughlin & chambers ( 2001 ) pointed out that short - term perturbations among massive planets in multiple planet systems ( such as gj 876 , hd 82943 ) can result in radial velocity variations of the central star that differ substantially from velocity variations derived assuming the planets are executing independent keplerian motions . on the other hand , the best - fit orbital solutions can vary a little from time to time provided that more updated observations were supplied or other elaborate fitting procedure was considered ( mayor et al .",
    "2004 ) , or the velocity trend is removed due to the unveiling of an additional planet or more planets ( fischer et al .",
    "2001 ) for a specific system .",
    "therefore , at this stage , it is meaningful to study the dynamical characteristics of the system based on the subsequent points : ( i ) slightly varying the orbital parameters about the best - fit parameters by adding the uncertainties with direct integrations , ( ii ) seeking for the possible stable geometry for hd 82943 in parameter space , ( iii ) the dynamical mechanisms of retaining the system and ( iv ) the likely eccentricity or configuration origin for two planets , which motivate us to dedicate to this contribution .",
    "next , we continue to describe the means of preparation for the initial orbital data before we start the numerical integrations : for each planet , we usually need to obtain six orbital elements - the semi - major axis @xmath30 , the eccentricity @xmath31 , the orbital inclination @xmath57 , the nodal longitude @xmath58 , the argument of periastron @xmath59 and the mean anomaly @xmath60 . here , two groups of the initial orbital elements were produced on the basis of the data by fit 1 and fit 2 . in each group , we assume that the semi - major axes of the two planets are always unchanged , say , for fit 2 , being 0.75 and 1.18au respectively . as we have indicated above",
    ", the two resonant planets are supposed to be coplanar for the initial configuration and the inclinations are both taken as small constant values not far from zero , e.g. , @xmath61 .",
    "the eccentricities and arguments of periapse are generated in the orbital parameters space in the proximity of the best - fit orbital solutions given the nominal observation errors .",
    "for example , for fit 2 , we take the observed eccentricities @xmath62 or @xmath63 to be centered , respectively , at 0.38 and 0.18 , and randomly displaced by not more than @xmath64 , respectively , then we obtain the resulting initial eccentricities for integration .",
    "still , we carried out similar steps to achieve the starting values of periapse arguments .",
    "the remained two angles of nodal longitudes and mean anomalies , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , such that the linear combination of initial arguments can be close to the resonant configuration , this is reasonable , because the real system is observably stable and approximate to 2:1 mmr . and in table 1 and 2 , we present the orbital solutions where the measurement errors of @xmath67 and @xmath68 , indicating that the eccentricities and periapse arguments are just equal to those by the geneva team . ] are randomly distributed between @xmath69 and @xmath70 . as a consequence",
    ", we obtained 100 orbits for each planet , to perform the integration of the planetary system , and each pair of the orbits was integrated for the time span of @xmath71 yr , unless otherwise stated .",
    "obviously , these orbits just lie in the neighborhood of the fitting parameters and represent the orbital motions quite close to the reality . here",
    "we make study of the possible motion near the best - fit orbital solutions and expect that such investigations can be helpful to reveal some important dynamical features for the studied system or present valuable clues on the searching for other exosystems related to a 2:1 resonance .    with the n - body codes ( ji et al .",
    "2002 ) , we carried out the numerical integrations for the hd 82943 system . in our simulations , we adopted the mass of the host star to be @xmath72 @xmath73 for fit 1 , and @xmath74 @xmath75 for fit 2 . under the assumption of sin__i _ _ = 1 , the minimum masses of two companions are employed throughout the paper unless we state elsewhere .",
    "in addition , we utilized the time step to be one percent of the orbital period of the inner planet ( hd 82943 c ) in the integrations .",
    "the numerical errors were effectively controlled during the integration , with the local truncation error @xmath76 for the time span of 10@xmath77 yr , in the meantime the accuracy was also checked by the energy errors . in comparison , we also employed symplectic integrators ( feng 1986 ; wisdom & holman 1991 ) to integrate the same orbit to assure the results for some cases .    in the research of the planetary systems , the maximum lyapunov characteristic exponent ( lce ) is usually adopted to identity the regular or chaotic orbits , since the chaotic orbits are sensitively dependent on the initial conditions , corresponding to a positive lce in the secular evolution . in this paper , we refer to the stability for the system means that the orbiting planets can remain periodic or quasi - periodic motions with bounded trajectories after the investigated time was done .",
    "we define the unstable orbits that either of the planets is ejected far away or moves too close to their parent star , and in our simulations , the integration was automatically ended when meeting the following criteria : ( 1 ) either of the eccentricities approaches unity , ( 2 ) either of the semi - major axes exceeds the factor of 2 or reduces half of the starting values , ( 3 ) either of the planets collides with the star or these planets do each other when entering the scope of the mutual hill sphere .",
    "to begin the study of the stable resonant geometry in hd 82943 , let us firstly recall several known facts in our solar system .",
    "one may be aware that the pair of jupiter and saturn is in a near 5:2 commensurability .",
    "in general , the mean motion resonance takes place in the pairs of the moons of the major planets ( such as the galilean satellites of jupiter : io - europa - ganymede ; see lee & peale 2002 ) , the asteroidal belt and kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) ( duncan , levison , & budd 1995 ; wan & huang 2001 ) . as more and more",
    "extrasolar planetary systems are being discovered , the resonant pairs are frequently found to occur in the multiple systems , e.g. , hd 82943 ( gozdziewski & maciejewski 2001 ) , gj 876 ( lee & peale 2002 ) , and possibly hd 160691 ( gozdziewski , konacki , & maciejewski 2003 ; bois et al .",
    "2003 ) in a 2:1 mmr , and 55 cnc in a 3:1 mmr ( ji et al .",
    "2003a ) , and so on .",
    "several theoretical or numerical works have been done to enhance the comprehension of the evolution into the resonances by non - conservative tidal forces ( ferraz - mello , beauge , & michtchenko 2003 ) , the convergent migration for the planets due to the disk - planet interaction by a damping force ( snellgrove et al .",
    "2001 ; lee & peale 2002 ; kley 2003 ) , the excitation of the orbital eccentricities by repeated crossings of two companions migrating on divergent orbits ( chiang et al .",
    "2002 ; chiang 2003 ) or the eccentricity growth by two resonant planets through inward migration ( murray , paskowitz , & holman 2002 ) , and resonant inclination excitation mechanism for migrating planets in the gas disk ( thommes & lissauer 2003 ) . on the other hand , if the two planets are trapped into a 2:1 resonance via one of the potential mechanisms , it is still necessary to understand their actual situation of orbital motions after the capture , and to investigate whether they can secularly survive in the system in some appropriate geometry and examine how the stability depends on the orbital parameters .    in the usual notation of celestial mechanics , the lowest order eccentricity - type ( see murray & dermott 1999 ) resonant arguments @xmath78 , @xmath79 for the 2:1 mmr are @xmath80 @xmath81 where @xmath82 , @xmath83 are , respectively , the mean longitudes of the inner and outer planets , and @xmath84 , @xmath85 denote their apsidal longitudes , respectively . additionally , the relative apsidal longitudes of two companions @xmath86 reads , @xmath87 as we mentioned previously , the apsidal alignment ( or antialignment ) is found to exist in most of the multiple systems ( kinoshita & nakai 2000 ; rivera & lissauer 2000 ; chiang , tabachnik , & tremaine 2001 ; laughlin et al .",
    "2002 ; lee & peale 2002 , 2003 ; gozdziewski et al . 2003 ; ji et al .",
    "2003a , b ; zhou & sun 2003 ) , to play a significant role in retaining the stability of the system ( gozdziewski 2003 ; ji et al . 2003b ) . moreover",
    ", this apsidal phase - locking of two orbits indicates that a pair of planets have common time - averaged rate of apsidal precession , and in the literature , it is also referred to apsidal resonance or corotation ( chiang et al . 2001 ; malhotra 2002 ) . for a 2:1 mmr",
    ", it is easily noticed that for the above three arguments , no more than two are linearly independent , indicating that either all three librate or only one librate in the occurrence of the libration of the critical argument . in more general case ,",
    "nelson & papaloizou ( 2002 ) also showed that both situations can occur for a @xmath88 eccentricity - type commensurability ( murray & dermott 1999 ) , where the associated resonant angles are defined by @xmath89(@xmath90 are positive integers and @xmath91 ) in the numerical surveys of the pair of the extrasolar planets .",
    "as a matter of fact , this was again verified in the case of the 3:1 mmr for 55 cnc ( ji et al .",
    "2003a ; zhou",
    "et al . 2004 ) , where not only do all three resonant angles of @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( here the subscript b , c , respectively , denote the two inner planets of 55 cnc b and 55 cnc c ) librate , but the relative apsidal longitude of @xmath95 librates about a constant angle simultaneously .    in the simulations of hd 82943",
    ", we found that three types of stable orbits can survive in this system : ( i ) only @xmath78 librates about @xmath69 , while @xmath79 and @xmath86 circulate ; ( ii ) case of alignment , three arguments all librate about @xmath69 , denoting by @xmath2 ; ( iii ) case of antialignment , both @xmath78 and @xmath86 librate about @xmath96 , while @xmath79 librates about @xmath69 , denoting by @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 . in the following sections",
    ", we will separately discuss above three stable configurations with both the numerical outcomes and analytical means and also compare them with remarkable evidences in other multiple systems involved in 2:1 resonance .",
    "first , let us suppose two planets with the masses of @xmath97 and @xmath15 orbit the central star with the mass of @xmath98 .",
    "here we only take into account the point - mass interaction between star - planet and planet - planet , without the consideration of the effects of the oblateness and general relativity arising from the parent star .",
    "thus , in jacobi coordinates ( @xmath99 ; assume @xmath100 ) , the hamiltonian for three - body system can be written ( brouwer & clemence 1961 ) : @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 here @xmath104 ( or @xmath105 ) is the distance between @xmath98 ( or @xmath97 ) and @xmath15 , @xmath106 the distance of @xmath15 with respect to the center of mass for @xmath98 and @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , the disturbing potential @xmath107 can be further expanded to the following forms for the coplanar case , @xmath108 where @xmath109 here @xmath110 in ( [ eq7 ] ) , @xmath111 depends on the semi - major axes ( in association with the laplace coefficients ) and the eccentricities of two planets and this expansion of the disturbing potential also requires the smaller values of @xmath36 ( i=1,2 ) and the two orbits without intersection . in the case of gj 876 , lee & peale ( 2002 ) expanded ( [ eq7 ] ) and collected the terms up to @xmath112 , the truncation series may be valid for low values of @xmath36 , where @xmath113 and @xmath114 ( laughlin & chambers 2001 ) , without the occurrence of the crossing orbits . in a more recent work ,",
    "beauge & michtchenko ( 2003 ) also developed an expansion method that can deal with higher values of the eccentricities up to a limit of @xmath115 , but they suggested that it is still related to the situation of the proximity between the planets .",
    "however , as for hd 82943 , the planetary eccentricities can be as high as 0.41 - 0.54 for fit 1 , or 0.18 - 0.38 for fit 2 , the development of ( [ eq7 ] ) with respect to large eccentricities can not be exactly applied , because the expanding series , consisting of a great number of the expansion items , either converge very slowly or become divergent in the collision circumstances .",
    "therefore , herein we seek for a semi - analytical treatment ( kinoshita & nakai 2002 ) for this question and then compare the analytical results with direct numerical integrations .",
    "we emphasize that this semi - numerical method corresponds to a first - order theory with respect to the small parameter @xmath116 , where @xmath116 represents the mass ratio of the jupiter - like planet to its parent star and is normally of the order of @xmath117 in the planetary systems , and can apply to the planetary system with any eccentricities , even for the mutual crossing case .",
    "the hamiltonian for the coplanar case is @xmath118 in order to keep the hamiltonian form , we should use jacobi coordinates to study this system . as the indirect part of the hamiltonian @xmath119",
    "does not contribute to the secular part , we simply take the direct part . as the two orbits of hd 82943",
    "are close to each other and may intersect ( ji et al . 2003c ; hadjidemetriou & psychoyos 2003 ; lee 2004 ) , the ordinary analytical expansions of the main part invalidate in the practical usage , then we adopt the original form of the main part of the disturbing function and numerically evaluate it .",
    "again , by eliminating short - periodic terms in the classical average process , the new hamiltonian reads : @xmath120 the degree of freedom of the new hamiltonian ( [ eq9 ] ) is reduced from four to two . however , the hamiltonian @xmath121 is not integrable . as we shall see in  3.2 that the semi - major axes of the two resonant planets slightly change when they are close to 2:1 mmr ,",
    "so we can assume that @xmath122 and @xmath123 are almost constant ( see figures 2 and 3 ) for the critical argument @xmath124 or @xmath125 .",
    "in final , the degree of freedom of the new hamiltonian is reduced to one : @xmath126 we again eliminate @xmath127 in equation ( [ eq10 ] ) with conservation of the total angular momentum @xmath128 ( see also appendix ) , then we have @xmath129 thus we can draw the level curves of the hamiltonian and understand the global behavior of @xmath130 and @xmath131 . as the eccentricity @xmath130 of the inner planet becomes large , we numerically averaged the original hamiltonian ( [ eq8 ] ) under the condition of the critical argument @xmath124 or @xmath125 and the angular momentum conservation relationship , and then obtain numerically the averaged hamiltonian ( [ eq13 ] ) with the parameter of the total angular momentum @xmath128 .",
    "the technique of the numerical averaging is extensively described in the paper ( kinoshita & nakai 1985 ) , in which the case of @xmath132 is also discussed . to make a study of the evolution of the eccentricities and the relative periapse arguments",
    ", we can draw the contour map of hamiltonian ( [ eq13 ] ) by taking @xmath131 as the horizontal axis and @xmath130 or @xmath127 as the vertical axis ( see figure 4 ) with the parameter @xmath128 , which is determined from the initial conditions .",
    "for the first 100 runs for fit 1 , each orbit integration lasts for @xmath133 yr .",
    "in the simulations , we notice that all the stable cases are involved in the 2:1 mmr and easily understand that the stability of a system is sensitive to its initial planetary configuration .",
    "furthermore , we noticed that 2% , 3% , and 2% of the cases belong to types i , ii , and iii and 93% of the systems destabilize , which means that either of the two planets leave _ in situ _ to the infinity with a rapid increase of the semi - major axes or the eccentricities grow much larger on the timescale @xmath134 yr or even shorter , owing to the mutual interaction between star - planet or planet - planet through frequent close approaches . in table 1 , are listed two sets of orbital parameters ",
    "fit 1a is related to the antialigned configuration for type iii and fit 1b is involved in the case for aligned orbits for type ii . here",
    "the adopted parameters for two planets are the masses of 1.63 - 0.88 @xmath135 , the semi - major axes of 1.16 - 0.73 au , the eccentricities of 0.41 - 0.54 .",
    "let us first examine the stable orbits of type i , where in the numerical simulations , we find that only one argument of @xmath78 librates about @xmath69 and the others @xmath79 and @xmath86 take up the full circulation from @xmath69 to @xmath70 . the semi - major axes @xmath136 and @xmath137 perform tiny oscillations about 0.73 and 1.15 au for the whole integration time",
    ". type i was initially introduced by gozdziewski & maciejewski ( 2001 ) with the previous fits . however , in this paper , types ii and iii , which can grasp the couple of companions escaping from deviating their tracks in two directions of remaining both the semi - major axes and the eccentricities , are new findings of stable orbits for this resonant system .",
    "hence , in the following sections , we primarily pay attention to the stable configurations linked to both a 2:1 resonance and the apsidal corotation .",
    "figure 2 shows the typical orbital evolution for fit 1a ( antialigned orbits ) . in the figure",
    ", we can see that the semi - major axes @xmath136 and @xmath137 slightly vibrate about 0.73 and 1.15 au for @xmath138 yr yr using symplectic integrator for this case , and no sign shows that the system will become chaotic for longer evolution . ] ( in the figure , to see more clearly , we simply display a snapshot for @xmath139 yr ) , meanwhile @xmath78 librates about @xmath96 with a moderate amplitude of @xmath140 , @xmath79 about @xmath69 with a smaller amplitude of @xmath141 and @xmath86 ( by _ thick line _ ) about @xmath96 with an amplitude of @xmath142 .",
    "it is noteworthy to point out that the 2:1 resonance variable @xmath78 librates in accord with the relative apsidal longitudes @xmath86 , occupying the same period of @xmath33 300 yr .",
    "this phenomenon can be easily understood because the above three angles are not independent in the course of the orbital motion .",
    "thus we can call @xmath78 and @xmath86 as two fundamental variables to characterize the stable planetary geometry in 2:1 mmr .",
    "in addition , the modulations of the semi - major axes @xmath143 and @xmath144 ( @xmath39 ) reveal the fact that the two planets are indeed trapped in a 2:1 mmr for the secular orbital evolution . in figure 2 , we further notice that the eccentricities of @xmath62 and @xmath63 separately range in ( 0.36 , 0.56 ) and ( 0.39 , 0.49 ) , bearing the equal libration periods of @xmath78 and @xmath86 .",
    "the orbital antialignment of axes in hd 82943 is reminiscent of that in the 2 : 1 orbital resonances for io - europa system ( lee & peale 2002 ) , in which @xmath78 ( involved in the io s longitude of periapse ) librates about @xmath69 , and @xmath79 ( involved in the europa s longitude of periapse , @xmath86 librate about @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "the antialigned circumstance for io - europa is equivalent to type iii in the sense of dynamically stable configuration , however , these jovian moons are occupying almost near - circular orbits resulting from the primordial or the tidal origin ( peale 2003 ) and the resonance configuration may come into reality when the eccentricities are small .",
    "by contrast , the hd 82943 system differs the io - europa pair in that both of the planets possess high eccentricities at present day .",
    "hence , the origin of the 2:1 resonance for hd 82943 ( fit 1a ) orbiting two massive planets with elliptic trajectories should be explained by an innovative mechanism rather than a capture induced by co - orbital differential migration ( s. peale 2003 , private communication ; see also  5 ) and perhaps stem from gravitational scattering in a crowded system that augment their eccentricities , i.e. , for a system with 10 planets ( adams & laughlin 2003 ) , the scattering processes can yield the full extent of possible eccentricity where @xmath145 .    recently , bois et al . (",
    "2003 ) found that the stable configuration of the hd 160691 system is possibly involved in a 2:1 mean motion resonance combined with an anti - aligned in two apsidal lines , with higher eccentricity ( @xmath146 ) of the outer planet .",
    "obviously , their research supported the stable geometry of type iii of hd 82943 , which also implies that this resonant topology may be suitable especially for the planets bearing larger eccentricities .",
    "moreover , this antialigned resonant configuration for fit 1a means that the conjunctions can take place when the inner planet moves near apoapse and the outer planet is close to the periapse , and _ vice versa _ , which indicates that the two planets are far from each other during their orbital evolution and protected from frequent close encounters .",
    "therefore , we can safely conclude that the stability of the hd 82943 system , which is related to the above coplanar configuration for fit 1a , can be simultaneously sustained by two dynamical mechanisms : the 2:1 mmr and the apsidal antialignment .",
    "figure 3 exhibits the orbital evolution for fit 1b ( aligned orbits ) .",
    "consequently , let us note that the semi - major axes @xmath136 and @xmath137 do not change dramatically but undergo small oscillations about 0.73 au and 1.15 au for @xmath138 yr ( a snapshot for @xmath147 yr ) , further the eccentricities @xmath62 and @xmath63 librate in the extent of ( 0.5 , 0.8 ) and ( 0 , 0.45 ) , respectively , in the behavior of the converse cycles , owing to the conservation of the total angular momenta for the system . here",
    "@xmath78 librates about @xmath69 with a small amplitude of @xmath148 , but @xmath79 and @xmath86 ( by _ thick line _ ) individually librate about @xmath69 with a large amplitude of @xmath149 . in this resonant aligned geometry",
    ", we again observe that @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath86 share the common librating period of @xmath150 yr , in the same time , coupled with the librating period of the eccentricities of @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "in addition , it is worthwhile to point out that at the time that @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath86 all approach zero ( where @xmath78 and @xmath86 start from the negative values to zero ) , the eccentricity of @xmath62 reaches the maximum @xmath151 and @xmath63 is close to the minimum @xmath152 , thus at the aligned conjunction point , the separation between two planets @xmath153 ( where @xmath136 and @xmath137 are almost preserved on the condition of 2:1 resonance locking ) can reach the maximal value and the maximum separation can prevent them from strong mutual perturbation when they rendezvous at the synodic location .",
    "similar analysis can be applied for the case of fit 1a , where both @xmath78 and @xmath86 run through @xmath96 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "again , let us make a brief comparison with the circumstance for the 2:1 resonant system gj 876 , which is also found to be in aligned configuration for the two orbits ( marcy et al .",
    "lee & peale ( 2002 ) further found that the amplitude of the librations of three arguments are not far from @xmath69 by using laughlin - chambers solutions and they even indicated that all the librations are remained even for the amplitudes of @xmath78 amounting up to @xmath154 for some cases . as for fit 1b , let us bear in mind the fact that the planetary eccentricities are much larger than those for gj 876 , although they may have similar planetary orbital geometry .",
    "sequently , the conjunctions always take place when two planets move close to their the periapse longitudes and the alignment can be maintained over long - term orbital evolution .",
    "this , _ de facto _ , reveals that type ii coplanar configuration may be possible for real observed systems of gj 876 and hd 82943 .",
    "here we adopted the semi - analytical model introduced in  3.1 to draw the hamiltonian contour and then compare these results with those given by direct integrations over secular orbital evolution .",
    "in the averaged hamiltonian after removing the short - periodic terms , the difference arising from the choice between the jacobi coordinates and astrocentric coordinates is the order of the perturbation ( @xmath155 ) , which could be ignorable .",
    "therefore , we adopt the astrocentric elements given in table 1 to be jacobi elements in the averaged model . as a comparison ,",
    "the initial orbital elements for numerical integration are also converted into the jacobi coordinates . in figure 4",
    ", we indicate that the contour diagram of hamiltonian ( [ eq13 ] ) are plotted against various levels by changing @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath156 , _ left panel _ represents the results for fit 1a , where the contour levels are exhibited by _",

    "( the innermost curve about marked _ plus _ ) , while _ right panel _ for fit 1b .",
    "the @xmath11 figures show a good agreement between the numerical outcomes and the semi - analytical solutions for two fits .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that the closest level of the hamiltonian contour to the numerical solution set the stable boundary for the apsidal resonant geometry , inside which the regular orbital motion for two orbits can be found with qualified eccentricities and the relative apsidal longitudes , thus we may conclude that this semi - analytical means is effective to help predict stable orbital solutions ( e.g. , beauge et al . 2003 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the diagrams of the hamiltonian contour further show that the stability zones for the eccentricities @xmath62 and @xmath63 are connected with the librating amplitude of @xmath95 : the smaller stability zones of the eccentricities , the narrower modulations of the relative apsidal longitudes , and _ vice visa_.    in addition , we calculated the equilibrium points for each fit : ( @xmath96 , 0.45 ) and ( @xmath96 , 0.46 ) , respectively , for fit 1a ; ( @xmath69 , 0.68 ) and ( @xmath69 , 0.29 ) , respectively , for fit 1b .",
    "as for fit 1b , we observe that there should exist stable orbits about the equilibrium center for @xmath157 ) , together with high eccentricity @xmath62 above 0.60 , which satisfy the necessary conditions for two planets evolving into a 2:1 resonance ( kley , peitz , & bryden 2004 ; see also  5 ) .",
    "again , we recall that the period of the 2:1 resonant variable @xmath158 is equal to that of the relative apsidal longitudes @xmath131 ( see figs . 2 and 3 ) , which can be clearly reflected in fig .",
    "moreover , in a view of the numerical results , we can see that the eccentricities of both planets are well restricted with the small - amplitude libration of @xmath131 about @xmath96 for fit 1a ( antialigned ) and large - amplitude libration of @xmath131 about @xmath69 for fit 1b ( aligned ) , which can also be consistent with the results in figs . 2 and 3 .    as aforementioned , different selections for the initial orbital parameters will lead to stable or unstable configurations for the hd 82943 system . by analyzing the starting orbital data",
    ", we discover that those stable planetary orbits involved in type ii ( or iii ) require the initial @xmath158 and @xmath131 should be constructed to satisfy the conditions of being less than tens of degrees from @xmath69 ( or @xmath96 ) , implying that the linear combinations of the mean anomalies , ascending nodes and periapse arguments can be close to the 2:1 resonant geometry .      as for the second 100 runs near the vicinity of fit 2",

    "in figure 8 , we can see the distribution of the initial orbital elements for these postulated planets ",
    "they initially move on the less inclined belt with the relative inclination with regard to the plane of the resonant pair no more than @xmath209 , the semi - major axis @xmath228 [ 0.96 au , 1.05 au ] , the eccentricity @xmath229 $ ] , and the leftover arguments are set at random .",
    "here we simply accounted for the near - circular orbits rather than much more eccentric orbits , because the life should develop and evolve in the biological environment without larger variations of temperature , implying the earth - like planet should not move neither too close nor too far from the parent star .    for each star - two - planet-``earth ''",
    "four - body system , we carried out the integration for the timescale of @xmath0 yr , to examine the dynamical habitability for the hd 82943 system . as we shall see",
    ", we find that none of the orbits can retained stable in the region at @xmath18 au for the integration time , the seed planet travels on hyperbolic or parabolic orbits at the characteristic timescale @xmath230 yr ( where 81% of them are ejected at @xmath231 yr and 95% at @xmath232 yr , see figure 9a ) , owing to the scattering ( lin & ida 1997 ) between two close resonant planets for the excitation in the eccentricity .",
    "a typical orbital evolution for the ejected orbits is shown in figure 9b , the semi - major axe @xmath30 grows from @xmath18 au to over 100 au , the eccentricity @xmath31 undergoes a rapid increase from @xmath233 to 1 and the inclination @xmath32 is also excited to a high value of @xmath234 ( in some cases , the inclination can exceed @xmath163 ) , finally , at @xmath235 yr , the assumed earth - like planet is scattered away from the two - planet system , while the orbital motions of the resonant planets remain as usual .",
    "the gravitational scattering on the terrestrial planet caused an unstable motion either as an ejection or a catastrophic collision with the star or planets due to the dynamical instabilities ( ford , havlickova , & rasio 2001 ) . our numerical investigations suggest that there will be least possibility for stable earth - like orbits surviving in the range of [ 0.73 au , 1.18 au ] , even for wider habitable regions [ 0.75 au , 1.40 au ] given by kasting et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , which is in good agreement with the simulations by menou & tabachnik ( 2003 ) .",
    "analytically , gladman ( 1993 ) attained the minimum separation @xmath236 between two planets moving on initially circular orbits require for stability , @xmath237 where the mutual hill radius @xmath238 is @xmath239 for fit 2 , we achieve @xmath240 au and @xmath241 au , which these values may become a bit different as the two planets for hd 82943 orbit on eccentric paths .",
    "nevertheless , our goal here is to present a qualitative analysis , and we can easily notice that the initial orbits for the assumed planets are quite close to hill sphere regime , resulting in their unstable motions .",
    "but it can not rule out other stable regions for additional companions .",
    "for example , sandquist et al . (",
    "2002 ) explored a three - planet case for hd 82943 , which a supposed jovian planet with the mass of 0.5 @xmath135 at 0.02 au was added to the system , and they found that this additional planet does not affect the orbital motion of the two outer planets and also not disturb the stability of this system .",
    "on the other hand , for the exterior domain extending to @xmath242 au @xmath243 au or even farther out , does there exist the dust rings or circumstellar disk that are analogous to the kuiper belt being a remnant of the solar nebula ?",
    "the recently launched sirtf mission will provide fruitful information on this point in its ongoing tasks .",
    "as a comparison , we accomplished the other same runs for gj 876 .",
    "and we conducted the four - body integrations for the time span of integration of @xmath160 yr ( @xmath244 orbital periods for the innermost planet ) and found all the systems are stable for the integration timescale .",
    "figure 10 exhibits the typical orbital evolution for the earth - like planet , both the semi - major axis @xmath30 and the eccentricity @xmath31 execute small fluctuations about 1 au and 0.06 , respectively , and the inclination @xmath32 also remains less than 2 degrees in the same time span .",
    "and there is no sign to indicate that such regular orbits at @xmath18 au with low eccentricities will become chaotic for much longer time even for the age of the star . due to the faint luminosity for m4 star gj 876",
    ", the habitable zones may reside in the range of [ 0.10 au , 0.20 au ] ( kasting et al .",
    "1993 ; menou & tabachnik 2003 ) sufficiently nearer to the orbits of gj 876 b ( @xmath33 0.13 au ) and gj 876 c ( @xmath33 0.21 au ) ( marcy et al . 2001 ; laughlin & chambers 2001 ; rivera & lissauer 2001 ) , hence , the global chaos , corresponding to the circumstance of a collisional disruption or ejection , can always take place according to the hill stability criterion ( gladman 1993 ; chambers , wetherill & boss 1996 ) or direct numerical examinations , and exclude the possible existence of earth - like planets for such habitable regions . whereas kuchner ( 2003 ) pointed out that a liquid planet with @xmath224 1.03 au @xmath223 ( where for gj 876 , @xmath245 au ) may exist under the protection of a thick steam atmosphere , it seems plausible for the earth - like planets revolve around gj 876 at the orbit about 1 au , in the concept of the dynamical habitability .",
    "however , our predictions should be confirmed through careful investigation in future research if the earth - like planets do survive secularly in such habitable zone .",
    "firstly , the direct evidence of the presence for such planets strongly depend upon the future high resolution astrometric measurements , e.g. , space interferometer mission ( sim ) or terrestrial planet finder ( tpf ) that can provide much better precision than the present long - term precision of @xmath33 2 - 3 m s@xmath246 ( butler et al .",
    "2003 ) for ground - based doppler surveys . secondly ,",
    "the simulations of the runaway accretion of the planetary embryos ( laughlin et al .",
    "2002 ) suggest that it is impossible for the earth - mass planets to be formed in habitable zones even for a well - separated system with near - circular orbits ( e.g. , 47 uma ) , because the formation of the terrestrial planets are terrifically constrained by giant planet migration ( armitage 2003 ) , therefore the depletion of small planetesimals in a disk - clearing phase may possibly take place when the massive planets sweep over them in their orbital decay process unless this orbital migration can halt at a proper position allowing for the continuous growth of the planetary embryos or the already - created earth - like planets can also follow the migration with the giant planets in step and cease about the habitable regions .",
    "nevertheless , fortunately , the terrestrial planets are conceivable to survive in a modest fraction of systems where a single generation of massive planets formed ( armitage 2003 ) without significant migration .",
    "the short - period giant planets that are close to the parent star with high temperature ( e.g. , 51 peg , so - called hot jupiter with @xmath247 au ) , are now thought to be formed through the shrinking orbital migration rather than be formed _ in situ _ due to the tidal interaction of a protoplanet with a surrounding gaseous disk ( ward 1997 ) and this orbital migration can originate from the exchange of angular momentum between the natal disk and protoplanet ( papaloizou 2003 and references therein ) .",
    "now , it is widely believed that the migration will ubiquitously come about when two - planet systems suffer tidal interaction with an exterior disk , the outer planet will migrate inward until it gets trapped in a low order mean motion resonance with the inner companion ( bryden et al .",
    "2000 ; kley 2000 ) and the eccentricities will stop growing and be balanced as steady equilibrium values ( nelson & papaloizou 2002 ) after being captured into the resonances .    for the aligned orbits of type ii , in the earlier works for gj 876 , snellgrove et al .",
    "( 2001 ) performed full hydrodynamical two - dimensional simulations to study the inward migration for gj 876 planets interacting with each other and a protoplanetary disk , and the outer planet can be trapped into a 2:1 commensurability with the inner planet through slow migration , where the orbits were observed to be aligned with the resonant angles librating about zero ( see also an overview in papaloizou 2003 ) and the system can survive at least @xmath248 orbits by the removal of the external disk .",
    "subsequently , lee & peale ( 2002 ) showed that the forced inward migration of the outer companion of the gj 876 system leads to certain capture into the observed resonances if the initial eccentricities are smaller enough where @xmath249 and @xmath250 with proper migration rates .",
    "they also revealed that after resonance capture , the eccentricities increase rapidly due to resonant interactions between the planets and the forced migration without eccentricity damping , while with parameterized eccentricity damping where @xmath251 , the eccentricities can reach equilibrium values that remain unchanged for sufficiently long migration in the resonances .",
    "recently , in the study of the evolution in resonant planetary systems ( e.g. , hd 82943 ) , kley et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found that the two planets can enter into a 2:1 resonance in varying timescale provided that @xmath252 , with both full hydrodynamical simulations and damped n - body calculations .",
    "they further suggested that there are several requirements for the 2:1 resonance capture  the more massive mass for the outer companion , the higher eccentricity of the inner planet and the apsidal alignment of @xmath253 . in the case of type ii (",
    "fit 2 ) , where the eccentricity @xmath254 and a moderate @xmath220 and with two nearly equal planetary masses , or in the case of fit 1b , where there can also be stable geometry about @xmath255 and a higher @xmath62 with a larger outer planet , in both cases the two planets undergo @xmath86-libration about @xmath69 , thus we may comment that if the hd 82943 system is most likely to be aligned ( lee m.h .",
    "2003 , private communication ) , then the origin for such orbital geometry can be possibly attained by the predictions of the hydrodynamic models ( kley et al .",
    "2004 ) , we will address this problem in our forthcoming paper .",
    "for the antialigned orbits of type iii , thommes & lissauer ( 2003 ) argued that if the planets reached this configuration by migration in resonance , a significant mutual inclination between their orbits would seem to be required .",
    "as in this geometry , the two orbits for hd 82943 can experience the intersection on the co - orbital region ( ji et al . 2003c ; lee 2004 ) , therefore a moderate inclination between two orbits can be achieved to act as a protection mechanism against close approaches ( thommes & lissauer 2003 ) . in  3.3.2 , we also show that the highly inclined resonant configuration for this system can also be in presence , which the system is stabilized by both the 2:1 resonance and the apsidal phase - locking .",
    "however , for fit 1a , although the hd 82943 system can be stable at least for @xmath0 yr , it is still difficult to secure the resonant capture with n - body models due to the larger eccentricities of 0.41 - 0.54 in kley et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , the origin for such configuration may attribute to an additional passing star s influence or pure gravitational scattering mechanism ( lin & ida 1997 ; adams & laughlin 2003 ) , to pump up the eccentricities .",
    "one of the final fates in the scattering procedure is that the inner planet is left alone in the system with an eccentric orbit while the outer planet is ejected ( ford et al .",
    "2001 ) into the stellar space , nearly immune to the gravitational influence from the parent star .",
    "if the scattering does happen in the course of the migration , a casual rapid capture may be required to prevent one of the planets from throwing away from the system and subsequently two orbits are well locked into 2:1 resonance ( see  3.2.1 ) at larger eccentricities .",
    "alternatively , another possible scenario is that both of the eccentricities are excited to moderate values when the 2:1 resonance is being crossed ( chiang et al .",
    "2002 ) , subsequently the continuous resonance crossings may terminate for the suitable eccentricities evolved into the resonance geometry .",
    "in this paper , we have explored the stable geometry for a system with two planets involved in a 2:1 mmr , and we mainly concentrate on the study of the hd 82943 system by adopting two different sets of the orbital parameters . in our numerical simulations , we found there are three possible stable configurations for hd 82943 system:(1)type i , only @xmath1 , ( 2)type ii , @xmath2 ( aligned case ) , and ( 3)type iii , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ( antialigned case ) .",
    "the direct integrations show that all stable orbits are related to the 2:1 commensurability that remains the semi - major axes for two companions slightly vary about the initial values over the secular dynamical evolution for @xmath0 yr , further the apsidal phase - locking for two planets can enhance the stability for this system , because the eccentricities are simultaneously preserved to prevent the planets from frequent close encounters . additionally , we comment that other systems trapped in 2:1 mmr ( e.g. gj 876 or possibly hd 160691 ) can select one of the aforementioned three stable topology in their authentic orbital motions , which are determined by their initial parameters . and we underline that such configurations , making up the dynamical families , can serve as a general regulation for the long - term stable orbits of the 2:1 resonant exosystems . in final , we summarize some conclusions :    using the earlier best - solutions of fit 1 , we found three types of stable orbits for hd 82943 , while we observed the steady configurations of types i and ii by employing the new solution of fit 2 supplied by mayor et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . in the meantime",
    ", we also proposed a semi - analytical model to study the @xmath11 hamiltonian contour determined by the initial parameters , and the closest level curves encompass the direct numerical results , which presents a good agreement between them .",
    "the theoretical figures can still provide valuable information on the dynamics for two planets .    given the stable geometry based on fit 2",
    ", we then extensively examined the dependence of the stability of hd 82943 in the orbital parameter space and the planetary mass ratios . in the case of the non - coplanar circumstances",
    ", we found that stability requires that the relative inclination be @xmath12 or less .",
    "for a fixed planetary mass ratio @xmath18 , the stable orbits for hd 82943 requires @xmath13 . for the non - constant mass ratio case ( where @xmath15 is kept ) ,",
    "the requirement of the stability is @xmath97/@xmath199 , which indicates an upper boundary for the mass of the inner planet .",
    "concerning the eccentricities , the system can be always steady when @xmath256 and @xmath17 . in a word , these outcomes do demonstrate that the stability for hd 82943 is strongly sensitive to the sound planetary masses , rather lower relative inclination between two orbits , the eccentricities and other orbital parameters .",
    "in addition , we showed that the assumed terrestrial bodies can not exist in the habitable zones of hd 82943 thanks to strong perturbations induced by two massive planets , but the earth - like planets can be dynamically habitable in the gj 876 system at @xmath18 au in the numerical surveys .",
    "however , as the additional measurements will improve the present best - fit solution for hd 82943 with a corrected model by taking into account the planet - planet interactions .",
    "thus , we hope to have more precise orbital solution not only to check for our presented predictions in this paper but to better make sense of the complete dynamics and the origin of this system in the near future .",

    "<S> we have numerically explored the stable planetary geometry for the multiple systems involved in a 2:1 mean motion resonance , and herein we mainly concentrate on the study of the hd 82943 system by employing two sets of the orbital parameters ( mayor et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2004 ) . in the simulations , we find that all stable orbits are related to the 2:1 commensurability that can help to remain the semi - major axes for two companions almost unaltered over the secular evolution for @xmath0 yr , and the apsidal phase - locking between two orbits can further enhance the stability for this system , because the eccentricities are simultaneously preserved to restrain the planets from frequent close encounters . for hd 82943 </S>",
    "<S> , there exist three possible stable configurations:(1 ) type i , only @xmath1 , ( 2 ) type ii , @xmath2 ( aligned case ) , and ( 3 ) type iii , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ( antialigned case ) , here the lowest eccentricity - type mean motion resonant arguments are @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the relative apsidal longitudes @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 are , respectively , the mean longitudes of the inner and outer planets;@xmath10 are the longitudes of periapse ) . and we find that the other 2:1 resonant systems ( e.g. , gj 876 or hd 160691 ) may possess one of three stable orbits in their realistic motions . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we also propose a semi - analytical model to study @xmath11 hamiltonian contours , which are fairly consistent with direct numerical integrations . with the updated fit </S>",
    "<S> , we then examine the dependence of the stability of this system on the relative inclination , the planetary mass ratios , the eccentricities and other orbital parameters : in the non - coplanar cases , we find that stability requires the relative inclination being @xmath12 or less ; as to the planetary mass ratio , the stable orbits for hd 82943 requires @xmath13 for a fixed value or @xmath14 where @xmath15 remains for the varying mass ratio ; concerning the eccentricities , the system can be always steady when @xmath16 and @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we numerically show that the assumed terrestrial bodies can not survive near the habitable zones for hd 82943 due to the strong perturbations induced by two resonant companions , but these low - mass planets can be dynamically habitable in the gj 876 system at @xmath18 au in the numerical surveys . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we present a brief discussion on the origin of the 2:1 resonance for hd 82943 . </S>"
