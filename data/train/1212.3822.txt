    "equivalently , it is a linear system @xmath9 modulo 2 in which @xmath10 is an @xmath11 01 matrix each of whose row sums is @xmath0 , and @xmath12 is an arbitrary 01 vector .",
    "random instances of many problems of this sort undergo phase transitions around some critical ratio @xmath13 of @xmath14 , meaning that for @xmath15 with @xmath16 , the probability that a random instance @xmath17 is satisfiable ( or possesses some similar property ) approaches @xmath18 , while if @xmath19 the probability approaches @xmath20 .",
    "( there is no loss of generality in hypothesizing the existence of a limit since , in a broad context , a result as stated implies the same with the weaker hypotheses @xmath21 and @xmath22 . )",
    "friedgut  @xcite proved that a wide range of problems have such sharp thresholds , but with the possibility that the threshold @xmath23 does not tend to a constant .",
    "the relatively few cases in which @xmath13 is known to be a constant include 2-sat , by chvtal and reed  @xcite , goerdt  @xcite , and fernandez de la vega  @xcite ( with the scaling window detailed by bollobs , borgs , chayes , kim , and wilson , @xcite ) , an extension to max 2-sat , by coppersmith , gamarnik , hajiaghayi , and sorkin  @xcite , and the pure - literal threshold for a @xmath0-sat formula , by molloy  @xcite .    the most natural random model of the @xmath0-xorsat problem is the `` unconstrained '' model in which each of the @xmath1 equations @xmath0 variables are drawn uniformly ( without replacement ) from the set of all @xmath3 variables , and the right hand side values are uniformly 0 or 1 ; equivalently a random instance @xmath9 is given by a matrix @xmath24 drawn uniformly at random from the set of all such matrices with each row sum equal to @xmath0 , and @xmath25 chosen uniformly at random .",
    "the case @xmath26 has been extensively studied .",
    "as shown by kolchin  @xcite and creignon and daud  @xcite , the random instance has a solution with limiting probability @xmath27 , where @xmath28 for @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 for @xmath32 .",
    "daud and ravelomanana  @xcite , and pittel and yeum  @xcite , analyzed the near - critical behavior of the solvability probability for @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "for @xmath35 , kolchin  @xcite analyzed the expected number of nonempty `` critical row sets '' ( nonempty collections of rows whose sum is all - even ) , whose presence is necessary and sufficient for the ( boolean ) rank of @xmath10 to be less than @xmath1 .",
    "he determined the thresholds @xmath36 such that the expected number of nonempty critical sets goes to 0 if @xmath37 and to infinity if @xmath38 ; in particular , @xmath39 .",
    "thus , for @xmath40 , with high probability @xmath10 is of full rank , so @xmath9 is solvable .",
    "it follows that the satisfiability threshold @xmath41 is at least @xmath36 .",
    "it is an easy observation ( see remark  [ > 1 ] ) that @xmath42 .",
    "however , kolchin could not resolve the precise value , or even the existence , of the satisfiability threshold .",
    "dubois and mandler  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) introduced a `` constrained '' random @xmath0-xorsat model , where @xmath12 is still uniformly random , but @xmath10 is uniformly random over the subset of matrices in which each column sum is at least  2 . for @xmath43 (",
    "3-xorsat ) they showed that its threshold for @xmath14 is  1 .",
    "this is of interest because from the threshold for the constrained model , they were able to derive that for the unconstrained model .",
    "dubois and mandler suggested that their methods could be extended to the general constrained @xmath0-xorsat , @xmath4 .",
    "however , their approach  the second - moment method for the number of solutions  requires solving a hard maximization problem with @xmath44 variables , a genuinely daunting task .",
    "our main result is that 1 continues to be the threshold for all @xmath45 .",
    "[ main ] let @xmath9 be a uniformly random constrained @xmath0-xorsat instance with @xmath1 equations and @xmath3 variables .",
    "suppose @xmath46 .",
    "if @xmath15 with @xmath47   then @xmath9 is almost surely satisfiable , with satisfiability probability @xmath48 , while if @xmath15 with @xmath49 then @xmath9 is almost surely unsatisfiable , with satisfiability probability @xmath50 .",
    "we are also able to treat the case when the gap between @xmath1 and @xmath3 is not linear but arbitrarily slowly growing , obtaining the following stronger theorem .",
    "[ sharp ] let @xmath9 be a uniformly random constrained @xmath0-xorsat instance with @xmath1 equations and @xmath3 variables , with @xmath51 and @xmath15 with @xmath52 .",
    "then , for any @xmath53 , if @xmath54 then @xmath9 is almost surely satisfiable , with satisfiability probability @xmath55 , while if @xmath56 then @xmath9 is almost surely unsatisfiable , with satisfiability probability @xmath57 .    rather than using the second - moment method of dubois and mandler , we use the critical - set approach of kolchin .",
    "remark  [ equiv ] shows that the two methods are equivalent , but the second leads to more tractable calculations , specifically , to a maximization problem with a number of variables that is fixed , independent of @xmath0 . in this constrained model , by the same reasoning given above , kolchin s approach will show that @xmath58 . and",
    ", by the same reasoning as for the unconstrained model ( again see remark  [ > 1 ] ) , we have @xmath42 .",
    "thus , for the constrained model ( unlike the constrained one ) , the two bounds coincide , establishing the threshold .",
    "dubois and mandler extended the threshold for the constrained 3-xorsat model to that for the unconstrained model by observing that , in an unconstrained instance , any variable appearing in just one clause ( or none ) , can be deleted along with that clause ( if any ) , to give an equivalent instance , and this process can be repeated .",
    "the key observation is that a uniformly random _",
    "unconstrained _ instance reduces to a uniformly random _ constrained _ instance with a predictable edge density ; the threshold for the unconstrained model is the value for which the corresponding constrained instance has density 1 .",
    "the same approach works for any @xmath0 , and we capitalize on existing analyses of the 2-core of a random @xmath0-uniform hypergraph to establish the unconstrained @xmath0-xorsat threshold in theorem  [ unconstrained ] .",
    "work on the rank of random matrices over finite fields is not as extensive as that on real random matrices , but nonetheless a survey is beyond our scope .",
    "in addition to the work already described , we note that the rank of matrices with independent random 01 entries was explored over a decade ago by blmer , karp and welzl @xcite , and cooper @xcite , among others .    concurrently with and independently from our work , the k - xorsat phase transition was also analyzed by dietzfelbinger , goerdt , mitzenmacher , montanari , pagh , and rink as part of a study of cuckoo hashing  @xcite .",
    "recently , darling , penrose , wade and zabell have explored a random xorsat model replacing the constant @xmath0 with a distribution , but the satisfiability threshold has not yet been determined for this generalization .    to translate our result for the constrained model to the unconstrained one , we exploit results on the core of a random hypergraph . for usual graphs ,",
    "the threshold for the appearance of an @xmath59-core was first obtained by pittel , spencer , and wormald @xcite . for @xmath0-uniform hypergraphs ,",
    "the @xmath59-core thresholds were obtained roughly concurrently by cooper @xcite , kim @xcite , and molloy @xcite .",
    "two aspects of cooper s treatment are noteworthy .",
    "first , he works with a degree - sequence hypergraph model ; taking poisson - distributed degrees reproduces the results for a simple random hypergraph .",
    "also , he observes ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.2 ) that the point at which a random @xmath0-uniform hypergraph s core has a ( typical ) edges - to - vertices ratio of 1 is an upper bound on the satisfiability threshold of unconstrained @xmath0-xorsat ; proving that this is the true threshold is the main subject of the present paper .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ prback ] formalizes our introductory observations about the first- and second - moment methods , the number of solutions , and the number of critical sets .",
    "section  [ prspaces ] shows that for the constrained model , instead of considering random 01 matrices @xmath10 , it is asymptotically equivalent to consider random nonnegative _ integer _",
    "matrices @xmath10 subject to the same constraints on row sums ( equal to @xmath0 ) and column sums ( at least @xmath60 ) .",
    "section  [ mainresult ] , using generating functions and chernoff s method , obtains an exponential bound for the expected number of critical sets of any given cardinality .",
    "section  [ provelemma ] uses this bound to show that , for @xmath61 and @xmath45 , the expected number of nonempty critical sets is @xmath62 .",
    "hence , with high probability , there is no such set , @xmath10 is of full rank , and the instance is satisfiable .",
    "we conclude that 1 is a sharp threshold for satisfiability of @xmath9 in the constrained case for all @xmath4 .",
    "section  [ sharper ] builds on the earlier results to treat the case @xmath63 and prove theorem  [ sharp ] .",
