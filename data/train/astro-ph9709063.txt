    "in recent years , models with a relic cosmological constant @xmath0 have received considerable attention for a number of reasons .",
    "first , dynamical estimates of the mass density on the scales of galaxy clusters suggest that @xmath4 for the matter @xmath5 that clusters gravitationally ( where @xmath6 is the ratio of the mean mass density of the universe to the critical einstein - de sitter density , @xmath7 ) @xcite .",
    "( some density estimates on larger scales are higher but remain controversial @xcite . )",
    "however , if a sufficiently long epoch of inflation took place during the early universe , the present spatial curvature should be negligibly small , @xmath8 .",
    "a cosmological constant , with effective density parameter @xmath9 , is one way to resolve the discrepancy between @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the second motivation for the revival of the cosmological constant has been the ` age crisis ' for spatially flat @xmath12 models , though the evidence currently is more ambiguous than it was .",
    "estimates of the hubble expansion parameter from a variety of methods are converging to @xmath13 @xcite , while determinations of the age of the universe from globular clusters have typically been in the range @xmath14 gyr or higher@xcite .",
    "these observations imply a value for the ` expansion age ' , @xmath15 , higher than that for the standard einstein - de sitter model , for which @xmath16 . on the other hand , for models with a cosmological constant , @xmath17 can be larger : for example , for @xmath18 , one finds @xmath19 .",
    "this argument has recently been called into question , however : revised determinations of @xmath20 based on the hipparcos distance scale are lower by approximately 2 gyr@xcite . if confirmed , this would largely alleviate the age problem .    third , cosmological constant - dominated models for large - scale structure formation with cold dark matter ( cdm ) and a nearly scale - invariant spectrum of primordial density perturbations ( as predicted by inflation ) provide a better fit to the observed power spectrum of galaxy clustering than does the ` standard ' @xmath21 cdm model @xcite .",
    "in particular , the shape of the power spectrum of galaxy surveys is generally consistent with @xmath22 @xcite .    despite these successes ,",
    "cosmological constant models face several difficulties of their own . on aesthetic grounds ,",
    "it is difficult to understand why the vacuum energy density of the universe , @xmath23 , should be of order @xmath24 , as it must be to have a cosmological impact ( @xmath25 ) . on dimensional grounds",
    ", one would expect it to be many orders of magnitude larger  of order @xmath26 or perhaps @xmath27 .",
    "since this is not the case , we might plausibly assume that some physical mechanism sets the ultimate vacuum energy to zero .",
    "why then is it not zero today ?",
    "in addition , the cosmological constant now faces strong observational challenges . in @xmath0 models ,",
    "a larger fraction of distant qsos would be gravitationally lensed than in a @xmath28 universe ; surveys for lensed qsos have been used to infer the bound @xmath29 at 95 % c.l .",
    "@xcite . further , while the power spectra of @xmath0 models with cdm have approximately the right shape to fit the galaxy clustering data , the cobe - normalized amplitude is too high , requiring galaxies to be anti - biased relative to the mass distribution  @xcite .    motivated by these theoretical and observational difficulties of the cosmological constant",
    ", attention has turned to models in which the energy density resides in a dynamical scalar field rather than in a pure vacuum state .",
    "these _ dynamical _ @xmath0 models @xcite  were proposed in response to the aesthetic difficulties of cosmological constant models .",
    "they were found to partially alleviate their observational problems as well ; for example , the statistics of gravitationally lensed qsos yields a less restrictive upper bound on @xmath30 in these models@xcite .",
    "in addition , for a range of model parameters , the amplitude of the density power spectrum is reduced relative to that of @xmath0cdm while its shape is retained  @xcite .",
    "these models also have a signature in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropy angular power spectrum that is distinctive from @xmath0 and einstein - de sitter models  @xcite .",
    "consequently , they should be tested with the next generation of high - resolution cmb temperature maps , e.g. , from the map and planck satellite missions .    in this paper",
    ", we consider another set of observational constraints on these cosmological models , arising from high - redshift supernovae . on",
    "- going projects to discover type ia supernovae at redshifts @xmath31 , coupled with improved techniques to narrow the dispersion in sn ia peak magnitudes , have renewed the prospects for determining the cosmological parameters @xcite . based on analysis of an initial set of 7 high - redshift sne ia , perlmutter etal .",
    "obtained the bound @xmath32 at 95% c.l .",
    "@xcite for spatially flat cosmological constant models . for @xmath0 models , this implies @xmath33 at this limit .",
    "these are preliminary results from a new method ; the degree to which they are affected by evolution , absorption , etc .",
    ", will be determined by the much larger samples now being gathered ( the world sample of high - redshift sne is now roughly a factor of 10 larger than that used to obtain the bound above ) .",
    "we consider constraints on dynamical scalar field models arising from high - redshift sne ia observations and compare them with constraints on @xmath0 models .",
    "the sne ia implications for some different but related cosmological models  in which there is an extra component described by an arbitrary fixed equation of state  have recently been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . here , we focus on three representative models for ultra - light scalar fields : pseudo - nambu - goldstone bosons ( pnbgs )  @xcite , inverse - power - law potentials  @xcite , and exponential potentials . in ",
    "ii , we review the motivation for and cosmic evolution of these models . in  iii , we derive the corresponding constraints from the sne observations .",
    "we conclude in  iv .",
    "the classical action for a scalar field @xmath34 has the form @xmath35 ,   \\label{action}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the planck mass , @xmath37 is the ricci scalar , @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the scalar field potential , and @xmath40 is the lagrangian density of non - relativistic matter and radiation . for simplicity , we assume @xmath34 is minimally coupled to the curvature , and we work in units in which @xmath41 .",
    "we consider spatially flat , homogenous and isotropic cosmologies described by the line element @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) scale factor .    in this paper , we focus on models in which the scalar field is dynamically important only at relatively recent epochs , at redshifts @xmath44 .",
    "thus , we model the matter content of the universe as a two - component system comprising the scalar field @xmath34 and non - relativistic matter @xmath5 .",
    "further , we assume that the energy - momentum of each component is separately conserved , so the matter energy density scales as @xmath45 .",
    "( there is no particle production as in some decaying @xmath0 models proposed in the literature @xcite . )",
    "the einstein and scalar field equations can be written as : @xmath46 @xmath47 where the hubble parameter @xmath48 ~. \\label{hubb}\\ ] ] in what follows , it will also be useful to characterize the instantaneous equation of state of the scalar field by defining its effective adiabatic index , @xmath49 for a static field , corresponding to a cosmological constant @xmath0 , @xmath50 , while for pressureless dust , @xmath51 .",
    "a number of models with a dynamical @xmath0 have been discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "we consider three representative scalar field potentials that give rise to effective decaying @xmath0 models .",
    "consider the properties that a massive scalar field must satisfy in order to act approximately like a cosmological constant at recent epochs .",
    "vacuum energy is stored in the potential energy density @xmath52 , where @xmath53 sets the characteristic height of the potential , and we set @xmath54 at the minimum of the potential by the assumption that the fundamental vacuum energy of the universe is zero ( for reasons not yet understood ) . in order to generate a non - zero @xmath0 at the present epoch , @xmath34",
    "must initially be displaced from the minimum ( @xmath55 as an initial condition ) , and its kinetic energy must be relatively small compared to its potential energy .",
    "this implies that the motion of the field is still ( nearly ) overdamped , so the scalar mass must be extremely small , @xmath56 ev .",
    "in addition , for @xmath57 , the potential energy density should be of order the critical density , @xmath58 , or @xmath59 ev .",
    "thus , the characteristic height and curvature of the potential are strongly constrained for a classical model of the cosmological constant .    in quantum field theory ,",
    "such ultra - low - mass scalars are not _ generically _ natural : radiative corrections generate large mass renormalizations at each order of perturbation theory .",
    "to incorporate ultra - light scalars into particle physics , their small masses should be at least ` technically ' natural , that is , protected by symmetries , such that when the small masses are set to zero , they can not be generated in any order of perturbation theory , owing to the restrictive symmetry .    from the viewpoint of quantum field theory , pseudo - nambu - goldstone bosons ( pngbs )",
    "are the simplest way to have naturally ultra  low mass , spin@xmath60 particles .",
    "pngb models are characterized by two mass scales , a spontaneous symmetry breaking scale @xmath61 ( at which the effective lagrangian still retains the symmetry ) and an explicit breaking scale @xmath53 ( at which the effective lagrangian contains the explicit symmetry breaking term ) .",
    "the pngb mass is then @xmath62 .",
    "thus , the two dynamical conditions on @xmath63 and @xmath53 above essentially fix these two mass scales to be @xmath64 ev , interestingly close to the neutrino mass scale for the msw solution to the solar neutrino problem , and @xmath65 gev , the planck scale .",
    "since these scales have a plausible origin in particle physics models , we may have an explanation for the ` coincidence ' that the vacuum energy is dynamically important at the present epoch @xcite .",
    "moreover , the small mass @xmath63 is technically natural .",
    "the effective scalar field potential in pngb models is approximated by @xmath66 constraints on the @xmath67 parameter space from gravitational lensing were analyzed in @xcite ; the large - scale power spectrum and cmb anistropy for these models were studied in @xcite .    to numerically integrate the field equations , we define dimensionless variables , @xmath68    with these definitions",
    ", we can rewrite the equations of motion in first order form , @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 here the overdot denotes @xmath72 .",
    "we numerically solve the above equations assuming that @xmath73 and that @xmath74 ( so the universe is initially matter - dominated ) .    in fig .",
    "1 we show the quantities @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 as a function of redshift , @xmath79 , for the parameters @xmath80 gev and @xmath81 ev . the initial conditions for the field were taken to be @xmath82 , @xmath83 . for this choice of parameters and initial conditions , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",

    "the @xmath90 and @xmath91 curves indicate that the field is just beginning to decelerate at redshift @xmath92 , as it nears the potential minimum ( @xmath93 ) for the first time . at high redshift , when the field is nearly static , the adiabatic index @xmath94 , and the field acts as a pure cosmological constant ; at late times , when the field kinetic energy becomes appreciable , @xmath95 rises above unity . in the future",
    ", the field would undergo damped oscillations around the minimum at @xmath96 , and @xmath95 would settle down to unity , the value for pressureless dust .    in figs . 2 and 3 , we plot contours of @xmath97 and @xmath30 as a function of the parameters @xmath61 and @xmath53 , also for @xmath82",
    "( for different choices of @xmath98 , the contour levels would shift around in the @xmath67 plane ; for comparison , see  @xcite . ) these figures show that there is a range of model parameters which give rise to acceptable values of @xmath97 and @xmath30 .",
    "we also note that , in the region of parameter space studied here , the linear transfer function for the growth of large - scale structure has an effective shape parameter given by @xmath99 , but the perturbation amplitude can differ from that in the corresponding @xmath0 model  @xcite .      for these models",
    "the scalar field potential has the form of an inverse power - law , @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are dimensionless constants .",
    "scalar potentials of this form arise , e.g. , in dynamically broken supersymmetry theories in which flat directions are lifted by non - perturbative effects  @xcite .",
    "however , for such a field to be dynamically relevant today requires @xmath103 ; this is just another statement of the cosmological constant problem .",
    "cosmological consequences of scalar fields with such a potential were investigated in @xcite . for @xmath104 ,",
    "the scalar field energy - momentum tensor approaches that of a conventional cosmological constant @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath105 constant ; in the opposite limit @xmath106 , the scalar field energy density scales like that of non - relativistic matter , @xmath107 .",
    "more generally , in the matter - dominated era at @xmath108 , when @xmath109 , the scalar field energy density scales as @xmath110 .",
    "thus , for fixed @xmath97 , the angular diameter distance to a fixed redshift , and thus the optical depth for gravitational lensing , decreases as @xmath111 increases . unlike the case of a cosmological constant , in these models it is possible to satisfy the lensing constraints  @xcite even for low values of @xmath112 ( see ref . ) .",
    "as we shall see in the next section , similar statements apply for the high redshift supernovae constraints .    by defining dimensionless variables ,",
    "@xmath113 the field equations can be rewritten as : @xmath69 @xmath114 @xmath115 we numerically evolve the fields using the initial conditions @xmath116 , @xmath117 as before . for fixed values of the model parameters @xmath111 and @xmath118 , the choice of the initial field value @xmath119 determines the cosmological parameters @xmath97 and @xmath30 .",

    "<S> recent observations of high - redshift type ia supernovae have placed stringent constraints on the cosmological constant @xmath0 . </S>",

    "<S> such models have been shown to share the advantages of @xmath0 models : compatibility with the spatial flatness predicted inflation ; a universe older than the standard einstein - de sitter model ; and , combined with cold dark matter , predictions for large - scale structure formation in good agreement with data from galaxy surveys . </S>",
    "<S> compared to the cosmological constant , these scalar field models are consistent with the sne observations for a lower matter density , @xmath1 , and a higher age , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> combined with the fact that scalar field models imprint a distinctive signature on the cosmic microwave background anisotropy , they remain currently viable and should be testable in the near future .    </S>",
