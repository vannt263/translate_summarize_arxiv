    "composite particles are foundationally important to physics at all scales ranging from cooper pair formation in superconductors , through bose - einstein condensation , and beyond .",
    "indeed at the cosmological scale we relabel all ordinary matter as  baryonic matter \" in deference to the fact that protons and neutrons dominate the standard model contribution to the energy budget of the universe . to characterize the phenomenology of these composite particles we often wish to benchmark how closely they imitate elementary bosons ( or fermions ) .",
    "if a composite particle exhibits ideal bosonic behavior , then it has an integer total spin , and as a corollary of the spin statistics theorem the wave function of a multiparticle composite boson ( coboson ) state is symmetric under the exchange of any two cobosons .",
    "prominent examples include hydrogen atoms , which consist of a proton and an electron ; semiconductor excitons , which are composed of electron - hole pairs ; and biphotons generated by spontaneous parametric down - conversion , which can exhibit composite behavior even when the single photon subsystems are spatially separated and noninteracting @xcite .",
    "the latter have engendered speculation about the origin of composite behavior .",
    "formation of composite particles has recently attracted a lot of attention from entanglement and many - body physics communities @xcite .",
    "quantum entanglement between the two constituent fermions as quantified by the purity of the reduced single particle subsystems is believed to be the resource behind ideal bosonic behavior of composite particles @xcite .",
    "analysis of composite systems shows that extremizing the purity improves the bosonic behavior @xcite .",
    "the degree to which composite bosons imitate elementary bosons can also be analytically quantified by studying the effect of adding and subsequently subtracting a single coboson @xcite and by novel interference schemes for many particle coboson states @xcite .    in the context of innovative research on many particle coboson states and",
    "interferometry we are motivated to ask whether composite bosons ( cobosons ) can form coherent states .",
    "coherent states hold special significance in interferometry experiments . in quantum optics",
    "coherent states are pure states which are separable after passing through a beam splitter .",
    "a dual motivation for this research is that coherent states are an important benchmark for studying nonclassicality in quantum optics . from this perspective",
    "formulating coherent states of cobosons will give us new tools for studying coboson statistics .",
    "for instance , a coherent state of a radiation field exhibits poissonian photon counting statistics as well as minimum uncertainty in position - momentum phase space @xcite , whereas fock states demonstrate sub - poissonian photon counting statistics which are a hallmark of nonclassicality . in this paper",
    "we use the framework of effective coboson operators to formulate coherent states and study their counting statistics and quadrature variances .",
    "we then examine a potential application for coherent states of cobosons within the proposed framework of maximum occupation number ( mon ) , where the mon is a restriction on the amount of composite particles that can condense @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii begins with our definition of the effective composite boson ( coboson ) annihilation operator and provides the eigenstate and the commutator . in sec .",
    "iii , we investigate the characteristics of the effective coboson operator and the eigenstate in quadrature variances and mandel s q parameter .",
    "then we consider the usefulness of the eigenstate for estimating the maximum occupancy number in sec .",
    "a composite boson is composed of two distinguishable particles a and b , in which both particles are either bosons or fermions . the wave function is decomposed into schmidt modes as follows @xcite , @xmath0 in the second quantization representation , the corresponding number state is generated by a creation operator , @xmath1 , acting on the vacuum .",
    "the number state is defined as @xmath2 is a normalization constant @xcite .",

    "( 2.5 ) , which is conventionally known as a coherent state , can be expanded in terms of the complete basis @xmath17 , @xmath18 with the condition @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "this implies that @xmath21 and therefore @xmath22 at this stage we take @xmath23 .",
    "for clarity we include the explicit formulation of the coherent state of cobosons : @xmath24 where the normalization constant @xmath25 is @xmath26 an implicit caveat on this construction is that the normalization constant @xmath27 must be finite .",

    "this indicates that there is a collection of well defined eigenstates for any anihilation operator satisfying @xmath32 .",
    "based on the property of the effective coboson operator , we can derive the commutator , @xmath33 & = &   \\sum^{\\infty}_{n=0 } |f_{n+1}|^2|n\\rangle \\langle n| \\notag -\\sum^{\\infty}_{n=0}|f_{n+1}|^2|n+1\\rangle \\langle n+1| \\notag\\\\ & = & |f_1|^2 |0\\rangle \\langle0|- \\sum^{\\infty}_{n=1 } \\left ( |f_{n}|^2 - |f_{n+1}|^2 \\right ) |n\\rangle",

    "in this section we apply well known measures of nonclassicality to the coboson annihilation operator and corresponding coherent state ; including quadrature variances and mandel s q parameter @xcite .",

    "note that we can not say anything about nonclassical properties of the composite bosons .",

    "here we can only state the distribution of statistics for coherent states of composite bosons , depending on the comprising particles , i.e. , bosons or fermions . using the properties of the effective coboson annihilation operator @xmath57 and the eigenstate @xmath67 , i.e. , @xmath68 and @xmath69 $ ]",

    "the coboson states of elementary bosons ( fermions ) can attain positive ( negative ) values which correspond to super - poissonian ( sub - poissonian ) statistics .",

    "we demonstrate how coherent states of cobosons can be used to estimate the maximum eigenvalue of the coboson number operator @xmath72 .",
    "physically this eigenvalue corresponds to the maximum number of cobosons that can occupy a single mode .",
    "this number limits potential realizations of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) of composite particles , since it gives a natural restriction on the amount of composite particles that can condense .",
    "the notion of composite bosons applies to situations in which one assumes that there exists an effective hamiltonian for which bounded states of two ( or more ) fermions form an eigenbasis .    for elementary bosons",
    "the maximum occupancy number is infinite , since the corresponding number operator is not bounded from above , and hence there is no restriction on the number of particles that can condense .",

    "this problem was studied in ref .",

    "next , note that for the coherent state @xmath67 ( [ eq : coherentstate ] ) one has @xmath77 and hence @xmath78 therefore , we have @xmath79 .",
    "furthermore , under the assumption that states of cobosons are eigenstates of the effective hamiltonian , coherent states of cobosons have to span the effective eigenbasis describing the physical system . as a consequence of this assumption ,",
    "the bound , ( [ bound ] ) , is true for every state .",
    "in addition , we showed that @xmath31 , therefore we conclude that@xmath80 for @xmath44 for all @xmath45 , i.e. , distinguishable particles , the lower bound is obtained as @xmath81 .",
