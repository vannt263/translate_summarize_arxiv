    "non - leptonic exclusive decays of @xmath0 mesons play a crucial role in studying the ckm mechanism of quark flavour mixing and in quantifying the phenomenon of cp violation .",
    "direct cp violation is related to the rate difference of @xmath12 decay and its cp - conjugate and arises if the decay amplitude is composed of at least two partial amplitudes with different re - scattering ( `` strong '' ) phases , which are multiplied by different ckm matrix elements .",
    "very often useful information on the ckm parameters including the cp - violating phase can be obtained from combining different decay modes , whose partial amplitudes are related by the approximate flavour symmetries of the strong interaction  @xcite , which are then determined from data .",
    "the direct computation of the partial amplitudes is a complicated strong interaction problem , which can , however , be addressed in the heavy - quark limit . the qcd factorization approach  @xcite employs soft - collinear factorization in this limit to express the hadronic matrix elements in terms of form factors and convolutions of perturbative objects ( hard - scattering kernels ) with non - perturbative light - cone distribution amplitudes ( lcdas ) . at leading order in @xmath13 , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a generic operator from the effective weak hamiltonian . at this order",
    "the re - scattering phases are generated at the scale @xmath16 only , and reside in the loop corrections to the hard - scattering kernels . beyond the leading order factorization",
    "does not hold , and re - scattering occurs at all scales .",
    "the leading contributions to the strong phases are therefore of order @xmath17 or / and @xmath13 .",
    "it is of paramount importance for the predictivity of the approach for the direct cp asymmetries to know whether the short - distance or long - distance contribution dominates in practice , since apart from being parametrically small , both could be numerically of similar size .",
    "the short - distance contribution to the direct cp asymmetries is fully known only to the first non - vanishing order ( that is , @xmath18 ) through the one - loop computations of the vertex kernels @xmath19 performed long ago @xcite .",
    "a reliable result presumably requires the next - to - next - to - leading order @xmath20 hard - scattering kernels , at least their imaginary parts . for the spectator - scattering kernels @xmath21 this task",
    "is already completed , both for the tree  @xcite and penguin  @xcite amplitudes , but for the so - called form factor term(s ) in the first line of ( [ factformula ] ) an important piece is still missing , which is the focus of this letter .",
    "we recall that due to ckm unitarity , the amplitude for a @xmath22 decay governed by the @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) transition can always be written in the form @xmath25 + \\lambda_c^{(d ) } \\,[p_c + \\ldots],\\ ] ] where @xmath26 .",
    "it is generic that the first ckm structure is dominated by the colour - allowed or colour - suppressed topological tree amplitude , both denoted by @xmath27 here , corresponding to the flavour quantum numbers of a @xmath28 transition , while the second is dominated by the topological qcd penguin amplitude of the @xmath29 transition .",
    "the first is typically larger than the second for @xmath30 and vice - versa for the @xmath31 case , which therefore refers to the penguin - dominated decays such as @xmath32 and related . in the notation of @xcite",

    ". refers to a generically sub - leading penguin contribution to the term multiplied by the ckm factor  @xmath35 .",
    "we also note that @xmath36 consists of a leading - power term @xmath37 and a power - suppressed term @xmath38  @xcite .",

    "the vertex kernels @xmath39 have been computed at the two - loop @xmath40 order only for the topological tree amplitudes @xmath27  @xcite",
    ". however , direct cp asymmetries can only be non - zero due to the interference of the two terms in ( [ generalamplitude ] ) , hence the penguin amplitude @xmath33 is also needed . only the one - loop @xmath40 contribution from the chromomagnetic dipole operator @xmath41 to @xmath33",
    "has been considered in the past  @xcite , while the dominant , genuine two - loop contributions remain to be computed .",
    "this calculation is technically very involved since it requires the computation of massive two - loop penguin diagrams  a genuine two - loop , two - scale problem .",
    "one step towards this goal was recently achieved in  @xcite , where analytic results of all occurring master integrals were derived .    at this point",
    "it is important to note that the topological tree and penguin amplitudes are not in one - to - one correspondence with the tree ( or current - current ) operators @xmath42 and qcd penguin operators @xmath43 of the weak effective hamiltonian . by contracting the @xmath44 fields of the operators @xmath42 ( see ( [ eq : q12p ] ) below ) ,",
    "they contribute to the qcd penguin amplitude starting from the one - loop order .",
    "since these `` penguin contractions '' of the current - current operators come with the large short - distance coefficients @xmath45 , we may argue that they constitute the largest contribution to the penguin amplitude at any given loop order .",
    "alone is not renormalization - group invariant , this statement can not be true in arbitrary schemes nor at arbitrary renormalization scales .",
    "what we mean is that the statement holds in the conventional @xmath46 scheme and with a reasonable choice @xmath47 of scale .",

    "while there is a cancellation for the real part , the imaginary part from @xmath42 is clearly dominant . if we add the vertex contractions at leading ( lo ) and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and consider the entire form factor contribution to @xmath49 at nlo , the second term changes to @xmath50 in both expressions , and the imaginary part from @xmath42 is still by far dominant .",
    "thus , at nlo , the short - distance direct cp asymmetries are mainly determined by the one - loop penguin contractions of the current - current operators .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the insertion of @xmath51 at two loops also captures the bulk of the yet unknown nnlo form factor contribution @xmath52 to the penguin amplitudes @xmath53 . in this letter",
    "we report the result of this computation together with a few phenomenological implications .",

    "the quark in the fermion loop can either be massless ( for @xmath59 ) or massive ( for @xmath60 ) . in the massless case",
    "the problem involves one non - trivial scale , the momentum fraction @xmath61 of the anti - quark in meson @xmath62 , and the structure is similar to the nnlo calculation of the tree amplitudes  @xcite . in the massive case , however , we are dealing with a genuine two - loop , two - scale problem since the hard - scattering kernels depend in addition on the mass ratio @xmath63 .",
    "as we have already elaborated extensively on the kinematics in  @xcite , we shall not repeat those formulae here .",

    "after the computation of the bare qcd two - loop amplitude , the hard - scattering kernels are extracted from a matching calculation onto soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) . the main conceptual challenge in this context is the consistent treatment of evanescent and fierz - equivalent operators in scet , for which we follow the method employed in  @xcite .",
    "the scet operators have the flavour structure @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 denote collinear light - quark fields moving in opposite directions .",

    "the situation is different for the @xmath272 final states where the @xmath273 contribution is small , and for the @xmath274 final states where due to the opposite sign of @xmath93 and @xmath273 a cancellation occurs . in these cases",
    ", we observe a large modification for the @xmath275 , @xmath276 and the corresponding @xmath274 final states , for which the cp asymmetry arises predominantly from the imaginary part of @xmath277 .",
    "these modifications are a reflection of the sizable corrections seen in fig .",
    "[ a4plot ] .",
    "the effect is much less pronounced in the remaining modes , where the asymmetry is due to interference with @xmath278 ( in case of @xmath279 , @xmath280 ) or @xmath281 ( in case of @xmath282 , @xmath283 ) , and the effect of the nnlo correction cancels to a certain extent in the ratio of interfering amplitudes . despite these large modifications of some of the @xmath145 and @xmath133 modes asymmetries ,",
    "the long - distance annihilation contribution is always more important numerically , and usually required to obtain a satisfactory description of the data .",
    "the modelling of the long - distance contribution also determines the final theoretical uncertainty , which can become very large .",
    "given that the short - distance contribution is now known to nnlo and given the large amount of experimental data , it becomes imperative to better determine the annihilation amplitude , presumably through fits to data .",
    "the computation of direct cp asymmetries in charmless @xmath0 decays at next - to - next - to - leading order in qcd has been a long - standing issue .",
    "the long- and short - distance contributions can in principle be of the same order and a nnlo calculation is required to ascertain the perturbative part . in this paper",
    "we computed the two - loop contributions of the current - current operators @xmath42 to the qcd penguin amplitude , which are expected to constitute the dominant contribution , at least to the imaginary part , which is required for observing cp violation .",
    "we find a sizable correction to the short - distance part of the direct cp asymmetry , the effect of which is , however , tempered by power - suppressed short- and long - distance terms .",
    "our preliminary conclusion is that the nnlo correction does not help resolving the @xmath174 cp asymmetry puzzle , nor does it render the poorly known annihilation terms redundant .",
    "the final analysis should , however , include the penguin operator matrix elements , as well as the one from the chromomagnetic operator considered in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding calculations are in progress .",
