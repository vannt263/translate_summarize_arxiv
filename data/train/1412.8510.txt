    "classical novae are all semi - detached binary systems consisting of a late - type star that fills its roche lobe and transfers material to a white dwarf companion @xcite .",
    "the transferred material slowly accumulates on the white dwarf s surface until the temperature and density at the base of the accreted layer become sufficiently high for a thermonuclear runaway ( tnr ) to ensue , leading to a nova eruption ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the progenitor binary is not disrupted in the process , and following the eruption , the mass transfer process resumes , eventually leading to another eruption .",
    "the time interval between successive eruptions varies considerably depending on properties of the progenitor system such as the mass and temperature of the white dwarf component and the rate of accretion onto its surface .",
    "models of nova eruptions suggest that systems with massive and luminous ( hot ) white dwarfs can trigger a tnr after accreting a relatively small envelope .",
    "thus , for a given accretion rate , such systems are expected to have the shortest recurrence times ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "systems that have been observed to have more than one eruption ( with recurrence times @xmath3100  yr ) have been traditionally referred to as  recurrent novae \" ( rne ) , although the distinction with classical novae ( cne ) is arbitrary given that strictly speaking _ all _ cne are believed to be recurrent .    given that rne are believed to harbor the most massive white dwarfs among all nova binaries , they are of particular interest as potential type ia supernova ( sne  ia ) progenitors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in particular , in the so called  single degenerate \" progenitor model , sne  ia",
    "are produced when a massive white dwarf in a close binary system accretes material from its companion star , pushing it over the chandrashekhar limit .",
    "if the white dwarf has a carbon - oxygen ( co ) composition , the result is the explosive burning of the co white dwarf ( a deflagration ) leading to a type  ia supernova explosion . if , on the other hand , the white dwarf is a onemg core , the result is believed to be an accretion induced collapse leading to the production of a neutron star .",
    "@xcite estimated the frequency of rn outbursts relative to cn outbursts in the galaxy , the lmc and in m31 and concluded that rne were not a major channel for the production of sne  ia . here , we present a comprehensive study of the positions of the 964 nova eruptions reported in m31 from september 1909 to the end of 2013 with the goal of determining the fraction of nova eruptions that are recurrent , and thus associated with the massive white dwarf progenitors potentially capable of producing type  ia supernovae .",
    "in principle , searching for rn systems should be straightforward .",
    "one simply looks for spatial coincidences among the reported positions of nova candidates observed in m31 .",
    "the database assembled by w. pietschm31novae / opt / m31/index.php ] is ideal for this purpose . in practice , however , uncertainties in the reported nova positions significantly complicate the process .",
    "the earliest recorded novae in m31 were discovered on photographic plates and reported primarily by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the equatorial coordinates were not reported , but instead cartesian offsets from the nucleus were given in a system with the x - axis oriented along the major axis of the galaxy , with @xmath4x pointing to the north - east .",
    "the y axis passes through the nucleus , with @xmath4y pointing to the north west ( @xmath4y points south - east in arp s convention ) .",
    "most of these early positions were reported to a precision of only 0.1@xmath5 .    in order to account for differences of precision in the reported positions of novae",
    ", we have adopted an initial screening criterion that varies depending on the expected uncertainty of the nova position . in all cases , to minimize the chance of missing a potential rn , loose screening criteria have been adopted in the initial search . for ccd surveys conducted after 1980 , where the coordinates are generally well determined , novae with reported positions that differed by as much as @xmath0 were considered to be potential rne .",
    "we have also adopted this screening criterion for novae discovered in the photographic surveys of @xcite where revised astrometry is now available ( pietsch et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . to account for uncertainty in the published positions of novae from earlier photographic patrols ( e.g. *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the reported nova positions are known to be less reliable , we have expanded our initial screening for rne to include novae with reported positions that differed by as much as 0.15@xmath5 .    clearly , such a coarse screening process will introduce significant numbers of chance positional near - coincidences , or  false positives \" in our search for rne .",
    "we can gain some insight into how likely chance positional coincidences are to affect our screening process by considering a ",
    "nearest neighbor nova \" distribution .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the result of binning the angular separations between each of the nova eruptions reported through the end of calendar year 2013 and their closest neighbor nova .",
    "the plot , which has been truncated to a maximum separation of @xmath6 , reveals that there are a total of 55 nova candidates with a neighbor within @xmath0 .",
    "all of these novae are included within our coarse screen .",
    "an additional 8 novae from early photographic surveys have been included in the expanded screen .    in an attempt to quantify the significance of a given positional near - coincidence ,",
    "we have estimated the probability of its occurrence as a function of position in m31 .",
    "specifically , for a given observed angular separation , @xmath7 , the probability of a chance positional near - coincidence , @xmath8 , can be estimated by considering the observed nova surface density ( assumed to follow the background @xmath9-band light of the galaxy ) in the vicinity of the nova , which we estimate by considering the number of novae in an elliptical annulus centered on the nucleus of m31 that contains the position of the nova .",
    "the width of the annulus is taken to be 1@xmath5 , with the inner and outer elliptical annuli located 0.5@xmath5 on either side of the nova s position .",
    "our estimate of the surface density is then simply given by the number of novae observed in the annulus , @xmath10 , divided by the area of the annulus , @xmath11 .",
    "since we do not know _ a priori _ which novae will be rn candidates , the computation of @xmath8 must consider the probability that any nova in the annulus lies within a distance @xmath7 of any other nova in the annulus . in practice , @xmath8 , for a given nova pair",
    "is simply a function of the observed separation , @xmath7 , and the surface density of novae at the location of interest .",
    "specifically , we have    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the overlap area for a chance positional coincidence of separation less than or equal to @xmath7 .",
    "not surprisingly , the probability of a chance positional near - coincidence is particularly high close to the center of m31 where the nova density is the highest ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .    out of a total of 964 nova eruptions reported in m31 through the end of 2013 , a total of 118 rn candidates have survived our initial screening process and are presented in table  [ rntable ] .",

    ", we also include screening data between all subsequent recurrences .",
    "below we consider the individual rn candidates that have passed our initial screen .",
    "for all rn candidates , we attempted to locate the original plate or digital image data in order to make a detailed comparison of the nova positions .",
    "we were largely successful , with the exception of some images taken as part of the @xcite survey that are no longer available .",
    "photographic plates , for example from the surveys of @xcite and @xcite , were scanned and converted into fits images for comparison with modern ccd images .",
    "images of the eruptions of a given rn candidate have been carefully registered using the ` geomap ` and ` geotran ` routines in iraf .",
    "once aligned , the relative spatial positions of the novae have been displayed through a comparison image formed by the ratio of the images of the individual eruptions .    in cases where the positions of the original nova eruption appears to coincide within observational errors with the subsequent eruption(s ) , we have re - computed the astrometry and determined revised coordinates for objects with poorly determined positions ( e.g. , those systems discovered on photographic plates prior to @xmath21980 ) .",
    "our revised coordinates are given in table  [ revcoord ] .",
    "for rn candidates that erupted in the early part of the 20th century ( e.g. , novae from the hubble survey ) , there can be significant proper motion of the field stars used in the revised astrometry . when known , we have excluded any field stars with measured proper motions in excess of 10 mas / yr in our astrometric solutions . in most cases",
    "we estimate our revised astrometry to produce nova positions accurate to 1@xmath17 .    given the limitations of the data ( e.g. , finite temporal and spatial resolution of the images ) , it is never possible to establish with absolute certainty that a given candidate is in fact a rn system .",
    "for example , there is always the possibility of a chance positional coincidence within observational uncertainty of two ( or more ) unrelated nova eruptions . in other cases ,",
    "given limited temporal sampling , there is the possibility for long period variable ( lpv ) stars to masquerade as novae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "despite these challenges , in the discussion to follow we have brought to bear all available evidence in judging the likelihood that a given candidate is a rn .",
    "this process has led us to place the rn candidates from our initial screen into one of four categories : ( 1 ) recurrent novae",
    " systems where the weight of the evidence strongly supports the spatial coincidence of the eruptions , and where the probability of a chance positional coincidence is low ( @xmath18 ) , ( 2 ) possible recurrent novae ",
    "systems where there remains some doubt as to the precise spatial coincidence of the eruptions or where the nature of the object is in doubt ( e.g. , a possible lpv or foreground galactic dwarf nova ) , ( 3 ) unlikely recurrent novae ",
    "often systems without available finding charts where the probability of chance positional near coincidence is relatively high ( @xmath19 ) , and ( 4 ) rejected recurrent nova candidates  systems where the archival images clearly establish that the eruptions are not spatially coincident .",
    "we begin by discussing the systems judged to be rne .",

    "therefore , their x - ray properties are consistent with these objects being rne , which require a high white dwarf mass and a high accretion rate to produce frequent eruptions .",
    "the notable exception from this picture is m31n 1919 - 09a , which was visible as a sss between 1000 and 2000 days after its 1998 outburst .",
    "although this property points towards a significantly lower white dwarf mass than for the other rne , the available x - ray data is insufficient to challenge seriously the classification of m31n 1919 - 09a as a rn .",
    "the 12 highly probable rn systems identified above have produced a total of @xmath174 nova outbursts out of the total of 964 outbursts observed in m31 up to the end of calendar year 2013 . from these data",

    "it is clear , however , that this ratio must be a lower limit to the true ratio of recurrent - to - classical nova outbursts in the galaxy given that the sporadic temporal and uneven spatial coverage of m31 surveys over the past century has impacted the discovery efficiency for rne , where at least two outbursts must be observed , considerably more than it has the discovery of systems classified as cne .      in order to accurately estimate how the discovery efficiencies of cne and rne differ in m31 , it would be necessary to know the exact temporal and spatial coverage as well as the limiting magnitudes of the many m31 surveys that have taken place over the past century .",
    "in addition , the typical recurrence times and light curve properties of both rne and cne would need to be known . obviously , the precise values for all of these parameters are not available .",
    "however , we can estimate the expected ratio of rn to cn outbursts from numerical simulations that are based on plausible values for these unknowns . before describing the simulations",
    ", we first turn to a discussion of the important biases that will affect the analysis .",
    "the history of nova discoveries in m31 is shown in figure  [ fig43 ] .",
    "a few notable features are apparent .",
    "the first clump of discoveries centered in the 1920s is due largely to hubble s pioneering survey @xcite .",
    "nova discoveries tailed off precipitously in the 1930s and essentially dropped off completely during world war ii .",
    "nova discoveries picked up significantly in the 1950s and 1960s as a result of the arp @xcite and rosino @xcite photographic surveys . then , after a short lull in the 1970s , nova discoveries began a steady increase due primarily to the ccd surveys of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and others . in recent years the number of novae discovered in m31 has exploded thanks to the contributions from automated surveys such as the palomar transient factory @xcite , and amateur astronomers throughout the world .",
    "in addition to the overall number of novae discovered over the past century , figure  [ fig43 ] also shows the distribution of rn outbursts observed over time .",
    "as expected , the number of _ outbursts _ of rn systems has increased roughly in proportion to the number of nova discoveries . however , despite the dramatic increase in the overall number of nova discoveries in recent years , the first recorded eruptions of our 12 rne and our 4 possible rne are spread relatively evenly over time .",
    "this result is not surprising .",
    "if surveys had been uniform over time , with the discovery of novae increasing at a steady rate , we would have expected the percentage of novae identified as recurrent to be higher for systems discovered early on , where more would be available for the discovery of subsequent outbursts .",
    "the fact that the density of observations has increased over time has blunted this effect and resulted in what we see , namely that the identification of new rn systems is approximately evenly distributed over the past century .",
    "in addition to the sporadic temporal coverage , the uneven spatial coverage of the various surveys can be expected to impact the relative discovery efficiencies of rne and cne . in particular ,",
    "the discovery efficiency of rne should be biased towards the bulge of the galaxy where the temporal coverage is more extensive . from a theoretical standpoint , it is unclear whether the recurrence times of novae ( and hence the relative populations of rne and cne ) should vary with spatial position in m31 .",
    "population synthesis models predict that younger stellar populations should produce nova progenitors that have on average more massive white dwarfs than do older stellar populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the recurrence times of novae are strongly dependent on the mass of the white dwarf ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , younger stellar populations should not only produce a higher observed nova rate @xcite , but also a higher fraction of systems classified as rne . despite these predictions",
    ", observations have consistently shown that novae are more prominent in older bulge populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the fact that the observed spatial distribution of rne does not differ significantly from that of novae generally ( see figure  [ fig42 ] ) suggests that an unbiased survey ( with more complete disk coverage ) may find that rne are more spatially extended than novae in general .",
    "if so , such a finding would be consistent with the predictions of the population synthesis models .      aside from the temporal and spatial uncertainties",
    ", we must also consider how variations in the limiting magnitudes of the observations will impact the discovery of novae in m31 .",
    "limiting magnitudes for most of the m31 surveys vary significantly , both between surveys and within the surveys themselves .",
    "thus , it is not possible to determine any single limiting magnitude representative of the full m31 nova sample .",
    "nevertheless , we can get an idea of the limiting magnitude of the  average \" survey by referring to figure  [ fig44 ] , which shows the distribution of discovery magnitudes for the 964 m31 nova candidates in the @xcite online database . here",
    "we assume that the average survey reaches a limiting magnitude down to the point where the discovery magnitude distribution turns over and begins to drop precipitously .",
    "based on the distribution of discovery magnitudes , it appears that a limiting magnitude of @xmath179 is representative of the typical m31 nova survey .",
    "given the considerable uncertainty in @xmath180 , in the simulations described below we have also considered how our results are affected by adopting limiting magnitudes of @xmath181 and 19 .",
    "we have performed a series of monte carlo simulations to predict the discovery efficiencies of both cn and rn outbursts in m31 under a variety of scenarios . in the simulations",
    ", we produce a total of 6500 synthetic novae erupting at random times over a 100 year time span @xcite , although the predicted ratio of rne to cne outbursts is not sensitive to the assumed nova rate . ] .",
    "model nova light curves are based on the the maximum magnitudes and rates of decline from the  high quality \" m31 sample of @xcite and from the galactic rn sample from @xcite for cne and rne , respectively .",
    "table  [ lightcurve ] gives the values of @xmath182 and @xmath183  ( mag  d@xmath171 ) assuming a distance and foreground reddening for m31 of @xmath184 and @xmath185 @xcite .",
    "for cne , an eruption reaches a maximum brightness and then fades at a rate that is chosen at random from the cn light curve parameters given in table  [ lightcurve ] .",
    "a model nova is considered  detected \" if it remains brighter than the adopted limiting magnitude ( @xmath180=17 , 18 , or 19 ) on the nearest survey date immediately following the date of the simulated eruption .",
    "the fraction of the 6500 novae that are detected is reported as the discovery efficiency for cne .    as a lower limit on the temporal coverage of m31",
    "we have simply taken the discovery dates of the nova candidates that have been discovered in m31 over the past century . then , to explore the sensitivity of our simulations to the temporal coverage , we have also considered the possibility that the actual survey coverage extended one or two days on either side of each of the dates were a nova was reported to be discovered .",
    "we refer to the temporal coverage estimates either as  clump  1 \" ( discovery dates only ) ,  clump  3 \" ( discovery dates plus the day immediately preceding and following each discovery date ) , or  clump  5 \" ( discovery date plus the 2 days preceding and the 2 days following all discovery days ) .",
    "it is also possible that there were more extended intervals of coverage where no novae were discovered , but we have no way of accurately accounting for this possibility .    in the case of rne , our simulations must produce multiple outbursts , and the rn discovery efficiencies will clearly depend on the assumed recurrence time , or the distribution of recurrence times , adopted in the simulations . to explore this dependence ,",
    "we have initially considered several trial recurrence times ranging from as short as 1 year ( the shortest observed rn recurrence time ) to a maximum of 90 years ( longer recurrence times have a negligible chance of being detected in our simulations that span just 100 years ) . as for cne ,",
    "the light curve parameters for rne have also been chosen randomly , this time from the rn sample given given in @xcite and summarized here in table  [ lightcurve ] .    to qualify as a rn outburst in our simulations ,",
    "a particular system must be detected _ at least twice _ over the 100 year time span of the simulation .",
    "the rn discovery efficiency is computed as the ratio of the total number of multiple outbursts detected to the total number of outbursts generated in the rn simulation ( i.e. , 6500 simulated nova outbursts plus all recurrences in the 100 year interval ) .",
    "the entire simulation for both cne and rne has been repeated a total of 100,000 times , with the cn outburst fraction , the rn outburst fraction recorded as the respective discovery efficiencies .",
    "the results of our monte carlo simulations of the rn outburst discovery efficiencies and their ratio to that of cne are shown in figure  [ fig45 ] . not surprisingly , the discovery efficiencies are strongly dependent on the assumed limiting magnitude of the surveys , with the deeper surveys resulting in higher rn discovery efficiencies .",
    "the assumed density of the temporal coverage is also important , with the discovery efficiencies increasing with increasing temporal coverage , as expected .",
    "it is interesting to note that at the shortest recurrence times , the discovery efficiencies for rne relative to cne for @xmath186 slightly exceeds that for @xmath187 for the  clump 3 \" and  clump 5 \" temporal distributions .",
    "this behavior results from the fact that the cn light curves have generally slower rates of decline when compared with the rn light curve sample .",
    "a fainter limiting magnitude thus increases the cn discovery efficiency more than it increases the rn discovery efficiency .",
    "this effect is most pronounced for the shorter recurrence times and denser temporal coverage where the rn discovery efficiency is already quite high .",
    "regardless of the limiting survey magnitude or the temporal coverage , these simulations confirm that the observed rn recurrence time distribution for known rne should strongly favor the discovery of rne having shorter recurrence times . to verify this prediction , in figure  [ fig46 ]",
    "we have plotted the observed outburst distribution for galactic and m31 rne , and compared it with the @xmath186 ,  clump 3 \" discovery efficiencies from figure  [ fig45 ] . since we simulated the same number of rne across all recurrence times ,",
    "the qualitative agreement shown in figure  [ fig46 ] is consistent with the hypothesis that the observed bias toward the discovery of short recurrence time rne can be explained solely by selection bias from an intrinsically flat distribution of rn recurrence times .    under the assumption that the intrinsic rn recurrence time distribution is flat over the range of @xmath188 years , we have conducted two composite recurrence time rn simulations . in the first composite simulation we choose recurrence times at random from the full range of @xmath189 years",
    "then , we consider a restricted range with recurrence times ranging from @xmath190 years that would be more appropriate for a population of rne where ultra - short recurrence time rne such as m31n 2008 - 12a are extremely rare .",
    "the results of the monte carlo simulation are reported in table  [ monte ] and shown in figures  [ fig47 ] and  [ fig48 ] for the various input parameters .",
    "columns 3 and 4 of table  [ monte ] give the fractions of cn and rn outbursts that are detected in the simulation , with column 5 giving the principal result of our simulation , the ratio of rn to cn outbursts detected ( see figs .",
    "[ fig47 ] ,  [ fig48 ] ) .",
    "column 6 gives our estimate of the true ratio of rn to cn outbursts , @xmath191 , after the observed outburst ratio given in equation ( 5 ) is corrected for the relative outburst discovery efficiencies .",
    "columns 7 and 8 then give our estimates of the expected numbers of rn and cn outbursts produced in m31 each year assuming a combined annual nova rate of 65  yr@xmath171 @xcite .",
    "as a check on our simulations , we note that the cn discovery efficiency predicted by our monte carlo simulations is in qualitative agreement with observations .",
    "given an annual nova rate of 65  yr@xmath171 , we estimate that approximately 6500 novae have erupted in m31 over the past century .",
    "our standard model ( @xmath186 ,  clump 3 \" ) produces a cn discovery fraction of 0.15 and predicts that approximately 975 novae will have been discovered over the past century , in very good agreement with the number of novae discovered in m31 .",
    "it is also worth noting that our values for the true ratio of rn to cn outbursts , @xmath191 , for our @xmath192 models are consistent with the ratio estimated by @xcite in their study of the rn populations in the galaxy , the lmc , and m31 .    under the assumption that the recurrence time distribution is flat in the range of @xmath188 years",
    ", we predict that rn outbursts make up @xmath210% of nova eruptions generally . for an annual nova rate of 65  yr@xmath171 , as many as @xmath193 outbursts per year",
    "are expected to arise from rn progenitors .",
    "if ultra - short recurrence time ( @xmath194 yr ) rne are relatively rare , our @xmath195 models suggest that as many as one out of three ( @xmath196 ) nova eruptions observed annually in m31 could arise from rn systems .",
    "this result is consistent with that found recently by @xcite for that fraction of galactic novae that are recurrent , and @xcite for the fraction of m31 novae with evolved secondary stars .",
    "sne  ia are thought to arise from the deflagration of an accreting white dwarf in a binary system @xcite .",
    "there are two primary models for the progenitor systems ( 1 ) a single degenerate channel , where the white dwarf accretes from a companion star in a semi - detached binary , and ( 2 ) a double - degenerate channel , where a pair of orbiting white dwarfs merge as a result of the loss of orbital energy and angular momentum from the emission of gravitational waves .",
    "rne are sometimes proposed as potential contributors to the single degenerate channel .",
    "however , the consensus has generally been that rne do not exist in sufficient numbers to explain the observed rate of sne  ia production in a galaxy like m31 .    based on our estimates for the rn rate in m31",
    ", we can explore whether these systems might make a significant contribution to the production of sne  ia in a galaxy like m31 .",
    "if we assume rne have a mean mass accretion rate , @xmath197  m@xmath198  yr@xmath171 , which is typical for galactic rn systems @xcite , and that each rn system must accrete a total of 0.3 m@xmath198 of material before reaching the chandrashakhar limit , it would take approximately 3 million years on average for a given rn to become a sne  ia . assuming a rn rate of as many as 20 per year and a mean recurrence time of 30 years between outbursts",
    ", we estimate that there could be as many as 600 active rn systems in m31 .",
    "this number likely represents an upper limit to the number of active rn systems in m31 given that most models predict fewer than 20 rn outbursts per year and the mean recurrence time is likely shorter than 30 years .",
    "thus , we arrive at an estimated upper limit to the rn  death rate \" of @xmath199  yr@xmath171 , which could produce perhaps as many as one sne  ia every 5000 yr in this galaxy .    @xcite has estimated that for typical s0a / b and sbc / d spirals , we can expect sne  ia birthrates of @xmath20.04 and 0.08 sne  ia per century per @xmath200 , respectively .",
    "adopting @xmath201 for m31 @xcite , gives expected sne  ia rates of @xmath202 and @xmath203 per century depending on hubble type . in the case of m31 , with an intermediate hubble type of sbc , we estimate a rate of @xmath204 sne  1a per century .",
    "thus , it appears that rne might be able to supply only @xmath22% of the sne  ia in a galaxy like m31 .",
    "given the uncertainties in the assumptions , this estimate clearly constitutes only a very rough estimate of the contribution that rne might make to the production of sne  ia in m31 .",
    "nevertheless , based on our analysis of the rn population in m31 , it appears very unlikely that rne could play a major role as sne  ia progenitors .",
    "we have undertaken a program to identify the fraction of rne in the nearby spiral galaxy , m31 .",
    "we have identified rn candidates by cross - correlating the published coordinates for 964 nova candidates recorded in m31 from 1909 september through the end of 2013 . allowing for a positional uncertainties @xmath205 ( @xmath206 for early photographic plate surveys ) , we have identified a total of 51 potential rn systems responsible for 118 observed eruptions . in order to determine which of these potential rne are in fact rne ,",
    "we have made an attempt to locate and analyze original plates , films , ccd images , and finding charts for each of the 118 eruptions .",
    "we were successful in locating a number of images that have allowed us to identify a total of 12 rn systems , with another 4 likely rne , representing a total of 40 eruptions .",
    "in addition , we have been able to rule out a total of 27 potential rn systems representing a total of 61 individual eruptions .",
    "the remaining 8 systems , representing 17 eruptions , are unlikely to be rne , but we have not been able to definitively rule out their rn nature .",
    "taking the 12 rn systems representing 32 eruptions , and assuming that 2 of the 4 possible rne representing 4 eruptions are in fact recurrent , we find that approximately 1 in 25 of the _ observed _ nova outbursts in m31 arise from rn progenitors . to correct for observational bias against the detection of rn systems",
    ", we conducted a simple monte carlo simulation to estimate the relative discovery probability for cn and rn outbursts .",
    "for plausible estimates of the m31 observational coverage , we estimate that as many as one in three nova outbursts observed in m31 could arise from a population of rn progenitors having recurrence times less than a century . despite the rudimentary nature of our simulation ,",
    "which is unable to accurately account for the inhomogeneous spatial and temporal coverage of the m31 data set , this number is consistent with the estimate for galactic rne found by @xcite , and with the relatively high fraction of m31 novae found to harbor evolved secondary stars @xcite . finally , based on our rough estimates for the number of rne active in m31 and their expected white dwarf masses and accretion rates ,",
    "we conclude that it appears unlikely that such systems can provide a significant channel for the production of type ia supernovae .",
