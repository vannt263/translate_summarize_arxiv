    "insights into the chemical evolution of the galaxy are provided by the relative abundances of elements in stars belonging to the main populations of the galaxy : halo , disk ( thick and thin ) , and bulge . in a common representation of abundances , one plots [ x / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] for the element x and fe .",

    "comprising one such class are the @xmath11-elements : the elements in this class include mg , si , s and ca , each with its most abundant isotope having a mass number that is a multiple of four .",
    "observations show that the runs of [ x / fe ] for each of the @xmath11-elements are similar for stars of a given population presently in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the value of [ x / fe ] is positive and constant ( say , @xmath12 dex ) for [ fe / h ] @xmath13 but decreases to the solar value ( i.e. , [ x / fe ] @xmath14 ) as thin disk stars are sampled at [ fe / h ] @xmath15 .",
    "the change in the variation of [ x / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] for @xmath11-elements at [ fe / h ] @xmath16 is widely attributed to the onset of contamination of interstellar gas with the fe - rich @xmath11-poor ejecta from type ia supernovae that reduces the [ @xmath11/fe ] previously established by @xmath11-rich fe - poor ejecta from type ii supernovae .",
    "theoretical modeling of galactic chemical evolution ( gce ) reproduces quite well the [ @xmath11/fe ] versus [ fe / h ] trends for the standard @xmath11 elements - see , for example , timmes , woosley , & weaver ( 1995 , hereafter , tww95 ) , goswami & prantzos ( 2000 , hereafter , gp00 ) , and kobayashi et al .",

    "titanium with its principal isotope being @xmath17ti would appear to qualify as an @xmath11 element .",
    "indeed , the observed run of [ ti / fe ] with [ fe / h ] is similar to that of a standard @xmath11-element . yet , gce models fail to predict the observed trend . for example , k06 who reproduce satisfactorily the observed trends for mg , si , and ca fail to match the trend for ti ; the predicted ti trend has the form expected for an @xmath11 element but at all [ fe / h ] , including the solar value , the predicted [ ti / fe ] is about 0.4 dex below the observed trend . gp00 and tww95 report comparable discrepancies : the predicted [ ti / fe ] are 0.3 to 0.5 dex below the observations for models that predict satisfactorily the run of [ ca / fe ] with [ fe / h ] .",
    "in general , the k06 predictions are a better fit to observations for elements from c to zn than either the tww95 or gp00 predictions .",
    "these failures to account for the evolution of the ti abundance are not attributable to inappropriate choices for the reference ( i.e. , solar ) abundances of ti and fe in confronting predictios with observations .",
    "uncertainties over the solar ti and fe abundances can not erase a 0.4 dex difference in [ ti / fe ] by revisions of the zero - points for [ ti / fe ] and [ fe / h ] .",
    "for example , substitution of asplund et al.s ( 2005 ) ti and fe abundances for those of anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) used by k06 shifts k06 s predictions by 0.22 dex to higher [ fe / h ] and by 0.13 dex to higher [ ti / fe ] , a far cry short of the 0.4 dex failure . clearly , aspects of ti nucleosynthesis are not yet understood .",

    "modeling of the thick and thin disks has yet to reach the detailed treatments given in the above cited and other papers for the chemical evolution of the halo - disk combination but apportionment of disk stars between the thin and thick disk is not going to solve the 0.4 dex ti problem .    with the intent of providing novel observational evidence on titanium nucleosynthesis , we have measured relative abundances for the five stable ti isotopes for a selection of m dwarfs drawn from the halo , thick and thin disks and spanning iron abundances from the solar value to about [ fe / h ] @xmath18 .",

    "predictions about the variation of the isotopic abundances with [ fe / h ] depend primarily on the yields from and the relative frequencies of type ii and type ia supernovae .",
    "pioneering predictions of the variation of the ti isotopic ratios with [ fe / h ] were provided by tww95 : relative to @xmath17ti and the solar system isotopic ratios , the predictions for @xmath0ti , @xmath19ti , @xmath20ti and @xmath1ti were factors of two too large , three too small , spot on , and two too small , respectively .",

    "our principal goal  the determination of the relative abundances of the five ti isotopes  is , as we show below , insensitive to the adopted effective temperature , gravity and metallicity of the adopted model atmosphere . a key parameter is the microturbulence because the abundance ratio of a trace isotope to @xmath17ti is 10 to 20 to 1 or greater and , thus , the @xmath17tio line may be saturated when its isotopic counterparts are conveniently detectable . however , the other stellar parameters are important in determining the metallicity and it is through the variation of the isotopic abundances with metallicity that we test the predictions of galactic chemical evolution .",

    "the m@xmath44-mass relationship from delfosse et al .",
    "( 2000 ) was exploited as a route to the surface gravity because it has a weak metallicity dependence .",

    "typically , the @xmath45 is estimated to about @xmath470.01 dex but this does not include the systematic errors resulting from the use of the two relationships .",
    "the ideal approach would be to determine @xmath27 from the tio spectrum . across the observed stretch of the @xmath22-system s 0 - 0 band , the @xmath17tio lines from the p , q ,",
    "and r lines do not show a sufficient difference in strength to provide a useful estimate of @xmath27 .",
    "additionally , many lines are blended with lines of the other isotopic varieties . in principle",
    ", one may use the satellite @xmath17tio lines for the desired comparison of weak and strong lines from which to determine @xmath27 .",
    "however , the spectrum is such that examples of clean satellite lines are impossible to find ; prospective satellite lines are blended with isotopic lines of similar strength from the p , q , and r lines , and also p , q , and r lines of the @xmath17tio @xmath22-system s hot ( @xmath48 ) bands .    as an alternative to comparing strengths of weak and strong lines of the same molecular or atomic species , we bound @xmath27 from the widths of tio lines .",
    "an upper limit to @xmath27 is determinable from imposing syntheses for different @xmath27 on an observed spectrum .",
    "after synthetic spectra are convolved with the instrumental profile appropriate for that observation , the upper limits with a slight star - to - star variation run from 1.5 km s@xmath30 to 2.5 km s@xmath30 .",
    "these are upper limits because we neglected contributions to the line width from rotation and macroturbulence .",
    "our assumption regarding macroturbulence is that it equals microturbulence , an empirical result of approximate validity for the sun and main sequence stars but taken as an extrapolation for late - k and early - m dwarfs .",
    "rotational velocities of m dwarfs are generally very low ( reiners 2007 ) , say @xmath49 km s@xmath30 equivalent to about a 0.2 km s@xmath30 apparent contribution to @xmath27 . with our assumptions - macroturbulence equals microturbulence and no rotation - the microturbulence for each star is provided .",
    "these values of @xmath27 are a factor of @xmath50 smaller than the upper limits .",
    "the uncertainty is about @xmath51 km s@xmath30 .",
    "saturation of lines is controlled , of course , by the quadratic combination of the thermal velocity and the microturbulence .",
    "the thermal velocity of a tio molecule at a representative temperature , say 3000 k , is @xmath52 km s@xmath30 , and , thus , a microturbulence less than about 1 km s@xmath30 has but a small effect on the saturation of lines .",
    "in some cases , small adjustments were made to the microturbulence on the basis of fits to the profiles of the tii and tio lines .",
    "the microturbulence is not reliably derivable from the small suite of tii lines used to obtain the ti abundance ; there are no weak tii lines ( the molecular haze impedes the measurement of weak lines ) , and the measured lines cover too limited a range in strength .",
    "our results for the microturbulence and macroturbulence are completely in line with results from the recent spectroscopic analyses of woolf & wallerstein ( 2005 ) and bean et al .",
    "for the early m dwarfs , here t@xmath53 k , woolf & wallerstein obtained a mean value of @xmath54 km s@xmath30 from 19 stars ; their estimates are from tii lines and the usual constraint that the ti abundance be independent of equivalent width .",

    "these @xmath27 determinations from atomic lines are consistent with our measurements reported in table 2 .",
    "an estimate of the metallicity is obtained from the tii lines , their solar @xmath32-values and the microturbulence values just discussed with an iteration such that the input metallicity for the model atmosphere is equal to that derived from the lines .",

    "the measurement of isotopic fractions is discussed below . inspection also suffices to show wavelength regions for which the synthetic spectra fail to match the observed spectrum . in those cases where the observed spectrum shows the greater absorption , one presumes that unidentified lines not included in the line list used for computing the synthetic spectrum are depressing the spectrum .",
    "these regions are ignored in assessing the isotopic fractions . surprisingly , there are places where the synthetic spectra shows more absorption than the observed spectrum .",
    "the tio molecule s contribution to the observed spectra is not simply from the @xmath22-system s 0 - 0 band and its p , q , and r lines and their five isotopic components .",

    "given the very high quality fit of synthetic to observed spectra , as demonstrated in figures 3 , 4 , and 5 , a low frequency of failures can not surely adversely affect determinations of the isotopic ratios .",
    "our impression is that wavelength errors for the lines from the @xmath79 bands may be largely responsible for the failures of class ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "there are , however , places where the synthetic spectrum with just the 0 - 0 main lines ( all five isotopes ) is stronger than the observed spectrum . two such examples are seen in figure 6 at 7074.45   and 7079.65  .",
    "scrutiny of the line list and the laboratory spectrum of tio shows that the tio lines from the less abundant isotopes are at their measured wavelengths and there are no atomic lines in the line list that are contributing unwanted absorption .",

    "an automated fitting routine was adapted for determining these fractions . for the final determinations ,",
    "an inspection of the fit between the observed spectrum and synthetic spectra for several different isotopic mixtures was made of selected features .",
    "the selection ( table 5 ) emphasises those features to which one or just two isotopes contribute .",
    "for the lesser abundant isotopes , we started with the @xmath19tio dominated features of which there were several .",
    "for each an abundance for @xmath19tio was determined and a weight assigned from the quality of the best fit .",

    "the isotopic abundances are expressed as a fraction of the total ( all isotopes ) ti . the uncertainties in table 7 and 8 calculated from the line - to - line scatter are one contributor to the total uncertainty ; systematic errors are discussed in the next section .",
    "lhs178 obviously enjoys a special place in the interpretation of the gce predictions ; it is the most metal - poor star and the sole representative of the galactic halo in our small sample .",

    "figure 5 shows three synthetic spectra and the observed spectrum .",
    "the spectrum for pure @xmath17tio including satellite lines and lines from the @xmath81 bands does not fit the observed spectrum , and , therefore , it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the less abundant ti isotopes have left their imprint on the observed spectrum .",
    "a comparison of observed spectra for other stars with tio strengths similar to those for lhs178 suggests too that the less abundant isotopes are contributors to the lhs178 spectrum .",
    "nonetheless , their abundances are plotted as upper limits in figures 7 and 8 .",
    "the relative abundances of trace isotopes are only very weakly dependent on the adopted stellar parameters .",
    "this is not the case for the ratios with respect to @xmath17ti because the @xmath17tio lines are saturated , quite severely so for stars like gj 699 and less severely so for gj 701 ; the ratio of the depths of the @xmath17tio to @xmath19tio lines is smaller than the approximately 12 to 1 ratio of the abundances .",
    "saturation brings into prominence the sensitivity of the measured isotopic fractions ( abundances relative to @xmath17ti ) to the microturbulence .",
    "errors introduced to the isotopic ratios by errors in the atmospheric parameters were characterized through a series of syntheses starting with a synthetic spectrum for the standard atmospheric parameters with 1% noise added .",
    "three different stars were represented : a cool star much like gj699 , a medium temperature star like gj701 , and a warm star mimicking the tio - weak stars . with these as the `` observed '' spectra , the chi - squared minimization routine found the best fit isotope abundance as each of the parameters was changed .",
    "adjustments to t@xmath82 of @xmath83k and to @xmath4 g of @xmath51 dex resulted in nearly constant changes to the abundances of each of the varieties @xmath78tio with the result that the isotopic abundance changes were less than about 1 to 2% , changes less than the errors arising from the line - to - line scatter .",
    "the abundance changes were approximately @xmath470.2 dex for the temperature change and @xmath470.09 dex for the gravity change .",
    "an [ fe / h ] change of @xmath470.2 dex in the adopted value for nextgen model atmosphere introduces a small change in isotopic abundances and negligible changes in the isotopic fractions .",
    "adjustments to the adopted microturbulence @xmath27 from an assumed value of 1 km s@xmath30 and across the uncertainty range of @xmath51 km s@xmath30 provide small changes in the isotopic fractions when referenced to the @xmath17ti or total ti abundance for all stars except those with the strongest tio lines ( e.g. , gj699 ) .",
    "for gj701 , for example , the @xmath17tio abundance was decreased by about 0.03 dex for the increase in @xmath27 from 1.0 to 1.5 km s@xmath30 with isotopic abundance ratios relative to @xmath17ti changing by 0.02 dex or less .",
    "the @xmath27 increase has a greater effect for the gj699-like stars with the @xmath17tio abundance decreasing by 0.10 dex and the isotopic ratios relative to @xmath17ti increasing by about 0.06 dex .",
    "these changes are of opposite sign and smaller for the reduction in @xmath27 by 0.5 km s@xmath30 because of the contribution of the thermal velocities to the total velocity controlling the saturation of the lines .",
    "these systematic uncertainties arising from @xmath27 are no larger , even smaller than , the random errors from the fitting of the synthetic spectra and the blending arising from the satellite and @xmath84 lines .",
    "certainly , the ratios among the four lesser abundant isotopes are dominated by random and not systematic errors .",
    "our results are summarized in figures 7 and 8 . in figure 7",
    ", we display the isotopic fractions @xmath78ti/@xmath17ti as a function of [ fe / h ] with the different symbols denoting thin ( open squares ) , thick ( filled circles ) disk stars and the cross the halo star lhs 178 .",
    "the three stars with kinematics that do not allow a clean attribution to either the thin or thick disk are represented by half - filled circles . in figure 8 , we display ratios among the less abundant isotopes with @xmath0ti in the denominator , and also the ratio @xmath0ti/@xmath17ti .",
    "three statements suffice to summarize the results in figure 7 .",
    "first , the stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath85 display the solar system isotopic ratios , as expected by every other abundance measure for the sun and stars of solar metallicity ; mismatches between the gce predictions and the solar system abundances are not attributable to the latter being anomalous .",
    "second , there is no clear difference between isotopic abundances for thin and thick disk stars across this small sample .",
    "third , the isotopic ratios are sensibly constant over the observed metallicity range from [ fe / h ] of zero to about @xmath86 .",
    "a similar set of conclusions applies to figure 8 where ratios with respect to @xmath0ti are given .",
    "pioneering predictions of the variation of the ti isotopic ratios with [ fe / h ] were provided by tww95 : relative to @xmath17ti and the solar system isotopic ratios , the predictions for @xmath0ti , @xmath19ti , @xmath20ti and @xmath1ti were factors of two too large , three too small , spot on , and two too small , respectively .",
    "isotopic ratios were predicted to decline steeply with decreasing [ fe / h ] : declines by factors of eight for @xmath0ti , six for @xmath19ti , two for @xmath20ti , and 30 for @xmath1ti between [ fe / h]@xmath14 and @xmath21 .",
    "such predictions do not match our results terribly well and , in particular , the [ fe / h ] dependences appear at odds with the observations .",
    "more recent predictions provide a closer fit to the observations and given the complexity of calculations of nucleosynthetic yields by type ii and ia supernovae and certain ingredients in a gce recipe ( i.e. , the initial mass function or imf ) , factors of two agreement between prediction and observation should be considered a success .",
    "two recent predictions are shown in figure 7 : ( i ) gce as represented by k06 with data supplied by kobayashi ( 2008 , private communication ) , and ( ii ) gce as modeled by gp00 with updates contributed by prantzos ( 2008 , private communication ) . before remarking on the comparison between these two predictions and our observations , we discuss the yields of the five ti isotopes from both types of supernovae .",
    "isotopes of titanium are synthesized in both type ii and type ia supernovae .",
    "predictions of the evolution of the isotopic abundances with metallicity involve calculations of the relative frequencies of type ii and ia supernovae and their respective yields plus a gaggle of additional assumptions about stars ( e.g. , the imf ) and the galaxy ( e.g. , infall rates ) .",
    "our intent here is not to diagnose critically the published predictions for the relative isotopic abundances but rather to extract from published predictions aspects of the nucleosynthesis of the ti isotopes .",

    "the principal effect of this second episode on the predicted evolution of the titanium isotopes is to increase the @xmath1ti/@xmath17ti ratio in the disk .",

    "dissection of the reasons for the now ( slight ) disagreements between observed and predicted isotopic ratios must ultimately account for the larger failure of the gce models to predict the observed run of [ ti / fe ] with [ fe / h ] .",
    "the predictions , as noted in the introduction , match quite well the shape of the observed run but predict values of [ ti / fe ] that are about 0.4 dex less than observed at all [ fe / h ] . a straight increase in yields of @xmath17ti but not other isotopes",

    "is the present underproduction of @xmath19ti a clue to how to make up the 0.4 dex discrepancy ?",
    "in addition , theoretical proposals for achieving enhanced yields of ti can not seriously affect presently predicted yields of mg , si , and ca for which gce models ( e.g. , gp00 and k06 ) reproduce well their variation of [ element / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] .",
    "the examples of mg , si , and ca also preclude the most naive way to reconcile the observed and predicted runs of [ ti / fe ] with [ fe / h ] , i.e. , invocation of a 0.4 dex reduction in the yield of fe from type ii supernovae .",

    "reddy et al . suggest that the difference in [ ti / fe ] between the two populations may be largely attributable to the formation of the thin but not thick disk stars from gas contaminated with type ia supernovae ejecta .",
    "if @xmath1ti is made in copious amounts ( relative to @xmath17ti ) as some predictions of type ia supernovae suggest , the proposed contamination seems difficult to reconcile with the observation here that the thick disk stars have as much , if not more @xmath1ti , as the thin disk stars . however , interpretation is complicated by the prediction that the @xmath1ti yield from type ii supernovae increases steeply as [ fe / h ] increases from @xmath21 to higher values .",
    "this is just the [ fe / h ] interval over which type ia supernovae make an increasing contribution to composition of the interstellar gas .",
