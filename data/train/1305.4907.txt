    "monte carlo ( mc ) sampling has increased dramatically our understanding of the behavior of statistical mechanics systems  @xcite .",
    "importance sampling , that is the metropolis _ et al . _",
    "@xcite method and its variants  @xcite were , for many years , the main tools in condensed matter physics , particularly for the study of critical phenomena in ising models .",
    "however , in many complex systems , effective potentials have a complicated rugged landscape with many minima and maxima which become more pronounced with increasing system size .",
    "thus , any reasonable mc sampling has to overcome energy barriers and cross from one basin to another in the state space in order to obtain a representative set of configurations .    in order to overcome such problems , occurring mainly in the study of first - order phase transitions , spin glasses and bio - molecules ,",
    "generalized ensembles have been developed with the two main categories known as the entropic sampling method and the parallel tempering sampling method  @xcite .",
    "parallel tempering ( pt ) , or replica exchange ensembles  @xcite are very effective alternatives for the study of spin glasses  @xcite , protein folding  @xcite and biomolecules  @xcite .",
    "pt involves a mixture of mc moves at the individual temperatures ( local moves ) with exchange attempts between different replicas ( swap moves ) .",
    "local moves depend on the implemented local algorithm , that is on the algorithm used at the individual temperatures .",
    "thus , a local move may be a spin - flip attempt ( metropolis algorithm ) , or a spin flip to a new state ( n - fold way algorithm ) or a cluster flip to a new state ( wolff algorithm ) .",
    "an obvious question is how often we should perform the swap moves , or how many local moves should intervene between swap moves .",
    "the number of swap moves required to transfer any replica from the highest ( lowest ) temperature to the lowest ( highest ) , and vise versa , defines the round - trip time and is one of the possible global measures characterizing the efficiency of a pt protocol .",
    "it is a measure indicating difficulties in the flow ( bottleneck effects ) as a replica moves from the high to low temperature and vise versa .",
    "schemes minimizing the round - trip time are expected to improve the general sampling efficiency of the pt protocols , facilitating equilibration and transitions between multiple minima in spin glasses .",
    "there are many different ways to construct such a pt protocol and the available freedom in choosing specific details makes their comparison a challenging job  @xcite .",
    "our motivation in the present comparative study is to shed new light on aspects that appear to be still undissolved .",
    "we attempt this by combining several features and test the behavior of the resulting pt protocols .",
    "we consider two methods for the selection of temperature sequences and test their performance by varying the numbers of local moves used at each temperature .",
    "one of these methods is the simple constant acceptance exchange ( cae ) method  @xcite . using this selection method , bittner _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have shown that if the numbers of local moves are related to the canonical correlation times , the resulting pt protocol appears to optimize the round - trip time of replicas .",
    "the calculation of correlation times needs additional costly preliminary runs , but the idea is of theoretical interest , and in some cases an inferred moderate approximation may be better than using an arbitrary not - too - small / not - too - big empirical mixture of local and swap moves",
    ".    the second method , for the selection of temperatures , was introduced by sabo _",
    "et al . _",
    "this method requires a constant increase in entropy between successive temperatures .",
    "this constant entropy increase ( cei ) approach is also supposed to optimize the performance of pt ensembles .",
    "the two methods of selection produce temperature sequences that are more concentrated in the temperature range where the specific heat has a maximum , with the cei method producing a more dense set close to the maximum point . in systems with sharp specific heat peaks , the difference between the corresponding protocols may be considerable and one would like to know their relative efficiency and how this may be influenced by other features of the protocols",
    ". we will confirm that the proposal of bittner _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for using numbers of local moves related to the canonical correlation times is the key ingredient for both selection methods .",
    "thus , using appropriate cluster algorithms for the local moves one obtains very effective protocols optimizing the round - trip time .",
    "there is also great freedom in the choice of the exchange of replicas , although most protocols use adjacent exchange attempts . even in the case of adjacent exchange moves ,",
    "the performance of pt is influenced by further details , such as the numbers of local moves used between exchange attempts and the ordering or mixing of the exchange attempts .",
    "nonadjacent exchange attempts can be incorporated in the pt schemes in a way that fully maintains detailed balance . however , remote exchanges have in general very small acceptance rates , and such schemes may well waste time in unsuccessful attempts , without any statistically significant increase in the sampling efficiency of the protocols .",
    "such methods of nonadjacent exchange moves have been also tried in constructing pt protocols  @xcite and will also be included in our tests in this paper .",
    "an alternative procedure for overcoming the problem of low acceptance rates for remote exchanges has been recently adopted , by enforcing exchange of nonadjacent replicas using kinetic mc methods  @xcite .",
    "the novel all - pair exchange ( ape ) method of brenner _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite is such a case .",
    "this method maintains detailed balance , at least in determining the probabilities of generating exchange moves ( between adjacent or not adjacent replicas ) . we will consider this method as a representative of kinetic mc methods and contrast its accuracy and efficiency with the nearest neighbor ( @xmath0 ) pt protocols . in particular , the combination of the ape method with a wolff ( w ) cluster algorithm  @xcite or a n - fold way algorithm will be examined",
    "this last algorithm is called also in the literature bkl algorithm  @xcite , after bortz , kalos , and lebowitz  @xcite who invented it .",
    "other names are continuous time mc or kinetic mc algorithm ( see discussion in sec .  [ sec:2b ] ) .",
    "the recent infinite swapping method  @xcite , will not be considered in this paper .",
    "this technique utilizes a symmetrization strategy , using all possible ( @xmath1 ) temperature ( replica ) permutations .",
    "the application and the performance of this method to the problem of finding true ground states of the 3d spin glass model is in our future interests .",
    "our numerical tests are carried out for the square ising model with linear size @xmath2 , @xmath3 lattice sites , and involve accurate measurements for the specific heat errors and the efficiency of the pt protocols .",
    "furthermore , detailed tests are carried out for efficiency and ground state production in 3d spin - glass models , where we find efficient low - temperature choices using , as a local algorithm , the n - fold way algorithm .",
    "the rest of the paper is laid out as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec:2a ] we give a brief description of two basic methods for selecting the temperature sequences for pt sampling .",
    "the tested @xmath0 and ape exchange schemes are detailed in sec .",
    "[ sec:2b ] and the rest of the pt protocol details are defined in the elementary pt step in sec .",
    "[ sec:2c ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we define measures for the specific heat errors and the efficiency and we present several tests of the pt protocols on the 2d ising model . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] we test the performance of some of the pt protocols for ground state production on 3d spin - glass models . in sec .",
    "[ sec:4a ] we discuss the problem of ground states for the 3d edwards - anderson bimodal ( eab ) model  @xcite , while in sec .",
    "[ sec:4b ] we consider a variant of this , with spatially uniaxial anisotropic exchange interactions and study the finite - size behavior of its ground - state energy .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] .",
    "in constructing an accurate and efficient pt protocol , the optimum selection of temperatures is still an open problem .",
    "there is a rather large number of ideas that have been proposed in the last decade to resolve this question  @xcite . according to the approach followed by katzgaber _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , optimal temperatures correspond to a maximum rate of round trips between low and high temperatures in temperature space and can be obtained using a recursive readjustment of temperatures .",
    "this feedback - optimized update scheme , is a sophisticated and appealing method , but because of its complexity , other simpler methods have been more often implemented in comparative studies and applications of pt .    among these simpler methods ,",
    "the cae method , when used with appropriate number of sweeps between replica exchanges , has been illustrated to produce a similar approach that optimize the round - trip time  @xcite . to obtain the temperatures corresponding to a cae rate @xmath4 we follow here ref .",
    "@xcite . starting from a chosen lowest temperature ,",
    "adjacent temperatures are determined by calculating the acceptance exchange rate from @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the energy probability density function for replica @xmath7 at temperature @xmath8 and @xmath9,\\ ] ] is the pt probability to accept a proposed exchange of two replicas , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "demanding that @xmath12 for all adjacent replicas , we obtain the temperatures of the required cae sequence ( from the above equations ) , provided that the energy probability density functions ( pdfs ) are known , or can be reasonably well approximated by some preliminary mc runs .",
    "although the exact density of states ( dos ) and the energy pdf for the square ising model with linear size @xmath2 is known  @xcite , we have used this information only for the exact determination of specific heat errors and not for defining the cae temperature sequence .",
    "instead , we apply a simple histogram method  @xcite to find the energy pdfs at any temperature , using a preliminary ( metropolis or pt ) run in an appropriate set of temperatures in the range of interest . applying then a recursive scheme we calculate the cae sequence , and repeating a metropolis run at these temperatures we estimate their canonical correlation times  @xcite .",
    "this practice can be applied to a general system for which the dos is not known , possibly using in the first preliminary run ( especially in a spin glass system ) a pt protocol in an _ ad - hoc _ reasonable set of temperatures .",
    "the second method of selection of the pt temperature sequence , requires a constant increase in entropy between successive temperatures  @xcite . to describe this method",
    "we follow sabo _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite and denote the @xmath13 temperatures of the cei sequence by @xmath14 and the total increase in entropy from @xmath15 to @xmath16 by @xmath17 . then the adjacent temperatures are determined starting from the given @xmath15 successively from @xmath18 where the specific heat at any temperature can be calculated from the above mentioned preliminary ( metropolis or pt ) run and a simple histogram method  @xcite . repeating a metropolis run at these temperatures we also estimate the corresponding canonical correlation times .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     ( color online ) finite - size behavior of gs energies per site for the 3d eab model and the present anisotropic model . in the insets we show their difference , which as shown in the nested inset , is much smaller than the estimated errors for @xmath19.,width=9 ]    we now consider the finite - size behavior of the gs energy of the anisotropic case @xmath20 . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "the anisotropic model , @xmath21 with @xmath22 , has been studied recently by the present authors , and its phase diagram has been presented in some detail  @xcite .",
    "the irrelevance of the anisotropy for the ferromagnetic - paramagnetic transitions was established , and further signs of universality concerning the other two kinds of transitions , ferromagnetic - spin glass and spin glass - paramagnetic , were pointed out .",
    "of particular interest , for our study here , is the observation  @xcite that , the phase diagram points of the spin glass - paramagnetic transition for the isotropic @xmath23 and the anisotropic @xmath20 cases are very close or even coincide .",
    "however , such a coincidence is a prediction which , although appealing , goes well beyond the general universality question , and can not be trusted before a formal proof is provided .",
    "we will now present results , that indicate an analogous situation for the asymptotic limit of the gs energy of these two cases , increasing the interest on a possible equivalence in the asymptotic limit .    following the approach of  @xcite",
    ", we produce here estimates for the finite - size gs energy per site for the anisotropic model .",
    "our simulations cover the range of sizes @xmath24 and we are using the pt protocol @xmath25 $ ] , which is a simple and efficient choice . in all runs , we choose @xmath26 , use a short disregarding part ( @xmath27 ) and vary the rest of the pt parameters as shown in table  [ tab:4 ] .",
    "in particular , the main running times ( @xmath28 ) are almost comparable to those in table b.3 of  @xcite .",
    "the temperature range used is approximately the range @xmath29 and the cae t - sequences were obtained using the practice outlined in the previous section , with an exchange rate , and corresponding number of temperatures , indicated in second column of table  [ tab:4 ] . for some sizes ( @xmath30 , and @xmath31 ) ,",
    "the numbers of local moves were varied in alternative runs , to test their effect on the estimated gs energies . our estimates of gs energies for the anisotropic model",
    "are given in table  [ tab:4 ] .",
    "also , in the last column of the table , we give the differences of gs energies per site between the isotropic model ( from table b.3 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the present anisotropic model .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] , we show the finite - size behavior of the gs energy per site for both isotropic and anisotropic 3d eab models . in the insets ,",
    "their differences are illustrated .",
    "in particular , it shown that their differences , for @xmath19 are much smaller than the estimated errors .",
    "therefore , the asymptotic limit of these gs energies practically coincide .",
    "the two dashed lines in the main panel indicate previous asymptotic estimations , namely @xmath32  @xcite and @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "we reviewed several pt schemes and examined their accuracy and efficiency .",
    "our tests on the 2d ising model suggest that , the two different methods of selecting the temperature sequences ( cae and cei ) considered in this paper , produce results that are accurate and are almost equivalent in efficiency .",
    "efficiency of pt protocols is greatly increased by using numbers of local moves related to the canonical correlation times , as proposed earlier by bittner  _ et al . _",
    "accordingly , we found that pt protocols using a wolff algorithm for the local moves increase the efficiency of the schemes .",
    "in particular an all - pair exchange method , the @xmath34 of brenner _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , when used with local wolff updates , has been found reasonably accurate and very efficient .",
    "however , it was also found that , in general , @xmath34 protocols may show an unreliable behavior in estimating thermodynamic equilibrium properties , such as the specific heat behavior illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "as argued , this may be related to an improper implementation of the kinetic mc method , that avoids the use of time weights for the mc averaging process .",
    "we also considered the problem of gs production of the 3d eab model , and we demonstrated the performance and relative efficiency of several pt protocols .",
    "we found that pt protocols based on the cae t - sequences appear to be slightly better than those based on the corresponding cei t - sequences . in all our tests ,",
    "the superiority of the pt protocols involving bkl ( or n - fold way ) local updates was firmly established . finally , we presented evidence that the asymptotic limit of the gs energy of the isotropic @xmath23 and the anisotropic @xmath20 eab models , are very close , and possibly coincide .",
    "this seems relevant to an analogous interesting behavior found recently for the finite temperature phase diagram points between spin - glass and paramagnetic phases  @xcite .",

    "<S> our tests suggest that , an earlier proposal for using numbers of local moves related to the canonical correlation times is one of the key ingredients for increasing efficiency , and protocols using cluster algorithms are found to be very effective . </S>",
    "<S> some of the protocols are also tested for efficiency and ground state production in 3d spin glass models where we find that , a simple nearest - neighbor approach using a local n - fold way algorithm is the most effective . finally , we present evidence that the asymptotic limits of the ground state energy for the isotropic case and that of an anisotropic case of the 3d spin - glass model are very close and may even coincide . </S>"
