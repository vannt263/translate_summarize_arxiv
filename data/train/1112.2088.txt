    "the hypervelocity stars ( hvss ) , recently discovered in the galactic halo @xcite , are moving so fast that they may escape from the galaxy . a natural explanation of these hvss is that they are ejected out from the galactic center ( gc ) by interactions of stars with the massive black hole ( mbh ) or the hypothetical binary mbhs as predicted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the ejection mechanisms of hvss can be divided into three categories : tidal breakup of binary stars in the vicinity of a single mbh @xcite , and the binary stars are probably injected into the vicinity of the mbh from the young stellar disk in the gc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or from the galactic bulge @xcite ; single star encounters with a binary mbh @xcite ; or single star encounters with a cluster of stellar mass black holes around the mbh @xcite .",
    "more than 16 hvss have been reported in the literature @xcite(see also : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , most of them are 34 m@xmath0 late b - type stars . assuming a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) , the expected solar mass hvss are about 10 times more abundant than 34 m@xmath0 hvss @xcite . @xcite",
    "systematically searched for such low mass hvss in about 290,000 spectra of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , however , they found only 6 metal - poor stars that can be possibly taken as hvs candidates , which might suggest that the imf of the parent population of these hvss is top heavy .",
    "a top heavy imf of the hvs parent population is possibly consistent with the disk origination @xcite . in order to distinguish the ejection mechanisms of hvss and put constraints on the origin of the parent population of hvss",
    ", it is quite necessary to search for the low - mass hvss .    in this letter",
    ", we aim to find f / g type low mass hvs candidates from the data release 7 ( dr7 ) of sdss , which provides a large catalog of stars with precise multi - color photometry and medium resolution ( @xmath1)spectra @xcite .",
    "we report the finding of 13 old metal - poor f - type hvs candidates , and also discuss their possible origins by detailed analysis of their kinematics .",
    "the letter is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the searching process of our low - mass hvs candidates .",
    "section 3 discusses their possible ejection mechanisms through kinematics .",
    "finally , a brief conclusion is given in section 4 .",
    "we analyze over 370,000 stars in the sdss dr7 with their five - band photometry @xmath2 and spectra , which are flux- and wavelength - calibrated in @xmath3  and are reduced by the automated segue stellar parameter pipeline @xcite to produce reliable heliocentric radial velocities rv@xmath0 and atmospheric parameters .      in order to find out the f / g type hvs candidates , we first select the high - velocity objects from the galactic radial velocity distribution of f / g type main sequence samples with the following methods .    1 .",
    "select f / g type main sequence samples with the five photometric criteria and log(g ) @xmath4 3.0 in section 2.3.1 of @xcite : [ 130775 ] .",
    "2 .   find objects at the high velocity end , which significantly deviate from the best fit gaussian distribution of line - of - sight velocities in the galactic rest frame @xmath5 : [ 369 ] .",
    "the numbers in brackets indicate the number of stars left after each selection step .",
    "the @xmath5 distribution of our 130775 samples , shown in the top panel of figure [ fig : ev1 ] , can be well fitted by the two gaussian distribution ( red solid curve ) .",
    "the two gaussian components have mean velocities ( and scatters ) of 0 km s@xmath6 ( 92 km s@xmath6 ) and 124 km s@xmath6 ( 55 km s@xmath6 ) respectively .",
    "approximately 82% of the samples belong to the low velocity component , and 18% of them belong to the high velocity component ( two dashed green curves ) .",
    "these two components probably correspond to the galactic halo population ( 0 @xmath7 100 km s@xmath6 ) and thick disk population ( 90 @xmath7 45 km s@xmath6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) respectively .",
    "the normalized residual of the observation from this two gaussian distribution is shown in the bottom panel of the figure [ fig : ev1 ] , and at its high velocity tail , high - significance deviations are found .",
    "so , we choose the high velocity objects with @xmath8 km s@xmath6 and @xmath9 km s@xmath6 , which have normalized residuals larger than 1 and are denoted by two red arrows .      to determine which high velocity objects are unbound to the galaxy , we first obtain the phase space coordinates for them . the galactic cartesian coordinate system adopted here",
    "is centered on the gc : the x axis points from the sun to the gc with the sun at @xmath10 = @xmath118 kpc ; the y axis points in the direction of galactic rotation ; the z axis points towards the northern galactic pole . assuming the motion of the local standard of rest ( lsr ) is 220 km s@xmath6 , and the velocity of the sun with respect to the lsr is ( 11.1 km s@xmath6 , 12.24 km s@xmath6 , 7.25 km s@xmath6 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the phase - space coordinates to the gc for these high velocity objects can be derived by equatorial coordinates ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) , galactic coordinates ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 , two components of the proper motion @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and the heliocentric distances ( @xmath19 ) . here , @xmath19 is equal to @xmath20 , where r is the deredden r - band apparent magnitude given by the dr7 and @xmath21 is the r - band absolute magnitude calculated by the photometric parallax relation of @xcite .",
    "then , we adopt two different galactic potential models , i.e. , a spherically symmetric model ( * ? ? ? * hereafter xue08 ) and a triaxial model ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter gnedin05 ) to estimate the escape velocities ( @xmath22 )",
    ". there are totally 13 objects ( mphvs1mphvs13 ,  mp \" means metal - poor ) as listed in table [ tab:1 ] , which are unbound to the galaxy in the xue08 model , but only three ( mphvs1mphvs3 ) are unbound in the gnedin05 model .",
    "the rest stars in the 369 high velocity objects are all bound to the galaxy in both models .",
    "we cross - check the @xmath22 for these 13 unbound candidates using other galactic potential models in the literature , e.g. , a spherically symmetric model from @xcite , two axisymmetric models from @xcite and @xcite with the same definition of unbound stars as in @xcite , and find that the @xmath22 from these divergent models are between the values obtained from the gnedin05 and xue08 models , and mphvs1 , mphvs2 and mphvs3 are unbound to the galaxy in all models .",
    "note here , a small fraction of the bound stars at the 2-@xmath23 level could be actually unbound due to the velocity measurement error , but the possibilities are certainly much less than those of unbound candidates .",
    "the basic information of these 13 candidates are listed in table [ tab:1] [ tab:3 ] .",
    "table [ tab:1 ] summarizes their basic parameters , i.e. , the name and its notation , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath16 , @xmath5 , g - band apparent magnitude g , and stellar atmospheric parameters @xmath24 , log(@xmath25 ) , and [ fe / h ] . table [ tab:2 ] lists their 6d phase - space coordinates and heliocentric distances @xmath19 . except mphvs13 ,",
    "the estimates of @xmath19 and velocities of other candidates are all valid , because their spectroscopic metallicities [ fe / h ] are in the valid range of that given by @xcite .",
    "table [ tab:3 ] compares their galactic total velocities @xmath26 with @xmath27 of the gnedin05 and xue08 models at their galactocentric distances @xmath28 , from which we can see whether they are unbound in a certain potential model .",
    "in addition , @xcite found 6 analogous metal - poor hvs candidates , so we also check whether they are in our high velocity objects . consequently ,",
    "only sdss  j074557.31 + 181246.7 is selected out and belongs to our bound objects , while the other five candidates are not in our high velocity objects mainly because they are inconsistent with the selection criterion 1 in section 2.1 .",
    "to investigate the origins of these 13 mphvs candidates , it is essential to study their kinematics . by varying the 3d velocities and positions within their measurement errors ,",
    "we calculate 10000 tracing - back trajectories and the 1 @xmath23 level intersection places with the galactic disk for each of mphvs13 with the gnedin05 and xue08 models , and those for each of mphvs413 with the xue08 model , because they are bound in the gnedin05 model , which are shown in figure [ fig : ev2 ] . from the left panel of figure [ fig : ev2 ]",
    ", we can see : ( 1 ) the trajectories of mphvs1 and mphvs2 do not intersect with the galactic disk .",
    "( 2 ) the trajectories of mphvs3 intersect with the galactic disk about 12 and 15 myr ago for the gnedin05 and xue08 models respectively , and the 1 @xmath23 intersection places are respectively shown by red and green ellipses . in the right panel : ( 1 ) the trajectories of mphvs4 and mphvs13 do not intersect with the galactic disk . ( 2 )",
    "the trajectories of mphvs5 , mphvs7 , mphvs8 , mphvs10 , mphvs11 and mphvs12 do intersect with the galactic disk about 10 to 20 myr ago , and the 1 @xmath23 intersection regions are depicted by 6 ellipses with different colors . ( 3 ) for mphvs6 and mphvs9 , most trajectories do intersect with the galactic disk , but most of the intersection regions are far away from the gc even to hundreds of kpc , so we just describe part of the trajectories for the two candidates , which are calculated with their present 6d phase - space coordinates , and do not show their intersection regions in the right panel .",
    "the trajectories of mphvs3 are consistent with being ejected out from the gc or the galactic disk , while those of mphvs5 , mphvs7 , mphvs8 , mphvs10 , mphvs11 and mphvs12 are consistent with originating from the galactic disk ( see figure [ fig : ev2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , a supernova explosion in a massive tight binary system @xcite or dynamical interactions in dense stellar clusters @xcite are possible originating mechanisms for these seven candidates , and dynamical interactions between ( binary ) stars and mbh(s ) in the gc are also possible ejection mechanisms for mphvs3 . for mphvs1 , mphvs2 , mphvs4 and mphvs13 ,",
    "their trajectories are incompatible with the gc origin or the galactic disk origin mechanisms ( see figure [ fig : ev2 ] ) .",
    "however , their origins may be interpreted as following .",
    "@xcite proposed that there are a large number of low mass ( @xmath29  1 m@xmath0 ) hvss ejected by the mbh in the center of m31 , and a fraction of them would be moving towards the milky way on the solar system side , with large galactocentric radial approach velocities ( @xmath30 km s@xmath6 ) exceeding the local escape velocity .",
    "the galactocentric radial velocities of mphvs1 , mphvs2 , mphvs4 and mphvs13 are @xmath3185 km s@xmath6 , @xmath32177 km s@xmath6 , @xmath3396 km s@xmath6 and @xmath34126 km s@xmath6 respectively , which means the approaching velocities of mphvs1 and mphvs2 are consistent well with the predicted @xmath35 km s@xmath6 , but it seems unlikely that mphvs4 and mphvs13 originated from the central mbh of m31 .",
    "the mphvs1 and mphvs2 are low mass stars ( @xmath29  1 m@xmath0 ) and on the side of the sun ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ev2 ] ) , considering of these factors , they seem to have been ejected out from the central mbh of m31 .",
    "the ejection rate of hvss from m32 is even higher than that from m31 @xcite , and thus m32 is also a possible origin of the two mphvs candidates .",
    "tidal disruptions of dwarf galaxies in the milky way can also produce high velocity stars as proposed by @xcite . and they suggested that the current detected hvss surrounding the constellation leo ( @xmath36 230@xmath37 , @xmath38 60@xmath37 ) may be a stream of stars from a dwarf galaxy that was recently tidally disrupted ( but see a different explanation of this in @xcite ) , and @xcite further proposed that such tidal disruption process of the massive satellites or satellites on eccentric orbits can also generate a population of old isolated high speed  escaped \" ( unbound ) or _  wandering \" ( bound ) stars_. if mphvs1 , mphvs2 , mphvs4 and mphvs13 are stars in tidal stripping streams , they may originate from other star streams , as their loci ( @xmath14 : 58@xmath37@xmath3969@xmath37 ; @xmath15 : -45@xmath37@xmath3933@xmath37 ) are far away from the leo area",
    ". if they are the isolated old  escaped \" tidal stripping stars , we can roughly estimate their stripping times since they only pass though our galaxy once and never come back .",
    "their estimated tidal stripping occurred about @xmath40 yr ago , assuming the dwarfs lie at the virial radius . such a short stripping time",
    "suggests that their parent dwarf galaxies or streams may be still detectable along their trajectories .",
    "therefore , further investigations are needed to find such dwarf galaxies , but the current comparatively large data errors impede such studies .    from the results of numerical experiments of mphvs6 and mphvs9 , they are possibly ejected out from either the galactic disk by corresponding mechanisms described above , or other places .",
    "the galactocentric radial velocities of mphvs6 and mphvs9 are @xmath41223 km s@xmath6 and @xmath42262 km s@xmath6 respectively , so they are unlikely to be ejected by the central mbh of m31 .",
    "the tidal interactions between satellite galaxies and our galaxy may be able to explain their origins , but they were surely not ejected out from star streams in the direction of constellation leo because their loci ( @xmath14:56@xmath37@xmath39185@xmath37 ; @xmath15 : 26@xmath37@xmath3931@xmath37 ) are also far away from that region .",
    "more exact conclusions about the origins of these two candidates mainly depend on more accurate data measurements in the future .",
    "note here , the large velocities of these mphvs candidates could partly be due to orbital motions , if they were in compact binaries .",
    "below , we give a simple estimation of the effect of binary orbital velocities on the observed heliocentric radial velocities and the galactic total velocities .",
    "if each of these mphvs candidates were in binaries , its companion could be a low mass main - sequence star , a neutron star or a black hole .    1 .",
    "a low mass ( @xmath43 1 m@xmath0 ) main - sequence companion : @xcite calculated the distribution of orbital periods for 60 detected metal - poor f , g and early k type binaries , and found the minimum orbital period was larger than 10 days , and correspondingly the minimum semi - major axis @xmath44 0.1 au .",
    "if the mass and semi - major axis of the companion are 1 m@xmath0 and 0.1 au respectively , the effects due to binary orbital motion could be most significant .",
    "the average effect of the projected orbital velocities on the line - of - sight is thus about 27 km s@xmath6 , and the maximum is about 67 km s@xmath6 , which introduce only approximate 3 @xmath39 7 km s@xmath6 and 9 @xmath39 31 km s@xmath6 effect to the 3d velocities of our candidates .",
    "in addition , if these candidates are really in such binaries , their heliocentric distances and galactic total velocities would be larger than our estimations , and the escape velocities would be correspondingly smaller , so these binaries should more likely be able to escape from our galaxy .",
    "2 .   a neutron star companion : the maximum theoretical mass of a neutron star is @xmath39 3 m@xmath0 @xcite , and",
    "if its semi - major is 0.1 au , the average line - of - sight projected orbital velocity is about 57 km s@xmath6 , and the maximum value is about 141 km s@xmath6 . in this",
    "cases , approximate 11 @xmath39 24 km s@xmath6 and 49 @xmath39 93 km s@xmath6 effects on the total space velocities of these mphvs candidates are introduced .",
    "3 .   a black hole companion : if the mass and semi - major axis of a black hole are 10 m@xmath0 and 0.1 au respectively , the average line - of - sight projected orbital velocity is about 115 km s@xmath6 , and the maximum velocity is about 284 km s@xmath6 , which introduce approximate 35 @xmath39 69 km s@xmath6 and 150 @xmath39 228 km s@xmath6 effects on the total space velocities of these candidates . in this cases ,",
    "the binary effect appears significant , so multiple observations are important to investigate whether these hvs candidates are in binaries with black hole companions .",
    "to close the discussion , we note here that only mphvs1 is unbound with high statistical significance , although all 13 hvs candidates are unbound in some galactic potential models .",
    "the proper motion estimates adopted in our analysis ( see table 1 ) , given by the sdss , may suffer some uncertainties as pointed out by dong et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , which may effect our estimations on the 3d velocities of those mphvs candidates . applying the model of dong et al .",
    "( 2011 ) ( see equation 6 ) , we re - estimate statistically the true proper motions of those 13 hvs candidates at 3-@xmath23 significance level . considering of this correction",
    ", we find that the highest velocity candidate , mphvs1 , is still unbound to the galaxy in both potential models though with a lower 3d velocity ( 877 km s@xmath6 ) .",
    "however , mphvs413 of the other 12 candidates are bound to the galaxy if adopting the xue08 potential or mphvs213 are bound if adopting the gnedin05 potential .",
    "so , those mphvs candidates , except mphvs1 , could be bound halo stars .",
    "if they were , it is possible to use them to set constraints on the galactic potential ( w.brown 2011 , private communication ) .",
    "in this letter , we report 13 metal - poor f - type hvs candidates from over 370,000 stars in the sdss dr7 . through the kinematic analysis , we find that seven of them are likely to have been ejected from the gc or the galactic disk .",
    "two of them were possibly ejected out from either the galactic disk or other places . meanwhile , the other four candidates were unlikely to originate from the gc or the galactic disk .",
    "those candidates impossibly ejected from the gc or the galactic disk may be explained by other mechanisms , i.e. , being ejected from the tidal break of the milky way s dwarf galaxies @xcite , or from the center of m31 or m32 by the interactions of stars with the mbh @xcite . in order to understand the origins of these mphvs candidates well and solve the binary problem ,",
    "second - epoch observations in future are needed .",
    "we thank yingchun wei for useful discussions , jeffrey a. munn for a comment on the proper motion provided by the sdss , eljko ivezi for a comment on evaluating the absolute magnitude .",

    "<S> those candidates which unlikely originated from the gc or the galactic disk , may be explained by other mechanisms , like the tidal disruption of the milky way s dwarf galaxies in the galactic potential , or the gravitational interactions with a massive black hole at the center of m31 or m32 . </S>"
