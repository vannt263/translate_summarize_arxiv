    "the interaction of vector mesons with nuclear matter has been a matter of investigation for years in connection to fundamental aspects of qcd @xcite .",

    "the latest experiments conclude that there is no mass shift for the @xmath4 and @xmath2 in @xcite and for the case of the @xmath3 the conclusion in @xcite is that there is no evidence of a mass shift .",

    "we shall find that there is a spectacular enhancement of the @xmath7 width in the medium , up to five times the free value of 50 mev .",
    "we also perform an estimate of the transparency ratio for @xmath7 production in the @xmath8 reaction , which can be analyzed in present experimental facilities .",

    "in particular , we extract a three - vector vertex term @xmath9 with @xmath10 the su(3 ) matrix of the vectors of the octet of the @xmath2 plus the su(3 ) singlet .",
    "one can also obtain the lagrangian for the coupling of vector mesons to the baryon octet given by @xcite : @xmath11\\rangle + \\langle \\bar{b}\\gamma_{\\mu}b \\rangle \\langle v^{\\mu}\\rangle \\right ) , \\label{lagr82}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the su(3 ) matrix of the baryon octet . with these ingredients",

    "@xcite , one can proceed by neglecting the three momentum of the external vectors versus the vector mass , in a similar way as done for chiral lagrangians in the low energy approximation , and one obtains the transition potential : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the pion decay constant , @xmath17 are the energies of the incoming and outgoing vector mesons , respectively , @xmath18 is the product of their polarization vectors , and @xmath19 are the channel coupling coefficients @xcite",

    "note that the relatively large decay width of the @xmath2 and @xmath0 vector mesons ( into @xmath24 or @xmath25 pairs , respectively ) is incorporated in the loop functions via the convolution of the @xmath21 function @xcite .    since we are interested in studying the interaction of @xmath0 mesons in nuclear matter , we concentrate in the strangeness @xmath26 vector meson - baryon sector with isospin @xmath27 ( @xmath6 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) and @xmath32 ( @xmath6 , @xmath33 , @xmath29 , @xmath34 , @xmath31 and @xmath35 ) .",

    "medium modifications on the @xmath43 scattering amplitude , which are incorporated in the @xmath6 loop function , come from two sources : a ) the contribution associated to the decay mode @xmath44 modified by the nuclear medium effects on the @xmath45 and @xmath46 mesons , and b ) the contribution associated to the interaction of the @xmath0 with the nucleons in the medium , which accounts for the direct quasi - elastic process @xmath47 as well as other absorption channels @xmath48 with @xmath49 .      the imaginary part of the free @xmath0 self - energy at rest due to the decay of the @xmath7 meson into @xmath52 pairs , @xmath53 , determines a value of the @xmath54 width of @xmath55 mev @xcite , which is quite close to the experimental value @xmath56 mev .",

    "we can see that the main contribution to the @xmath0 self - energy comes from the pion self - energy in dense matter .",
    "this is due to the fact that the @xmath65 decay process leaves the pion with energy right in the region of @xmath66 excitations , where there is considerable pionic strength .",
    "vertex corrections ( solid line ) reduce the effect of the pion dressing on the @xmath0 self - energy , giving a @xmath0 width of @xmath67 mev , which is about twice the value of the width in vacuum .",

    "we display the contribution to the self - energy coming from the self - consistent calculation of the @xmath43 effective interaction ( dashed lines ) and the self - energy from the @xmath80 decay mechanism ( dot - dashed lines ) , together with the combined result from both sources ( solid lines ) .    for @xmath0 energies around 800 - 900 mev we observe an enhancement of the width together with some structures in the real part of the self - energy .",
    "these result from the coupling of the @xmath0 to the dynamically generated @xmath81 and @xmath82 excitations , which dominate the behavior of the @xmath0 self - energy in this energy region .",
    "however , at lower energies where the @xmath83 channels are closed , or at large energies beyond the resonance - hole excitations , the width of the @xmath0 is governed by the @xmath44 decay mechanism in dense matter . at the @xmath0 mass , the @xmath0 feels a moderately attractive optical potential and acquires a width of @xmath84 mev , which is about five times its width in vacuum .",

    "the structures above the quasiparticle peak correspond to @xmath81 and @xmath82 excitations .",
    "density effects result in a dilution and merging of those resonant - hole states , together with a general broadening of the spectral function due to the increase of collisional and absorption processes .",
    "although the real part of the optical potential is moderate , -50 mev at @xmath59 , the interferences with the resonant - hole modes push the @xmath7 quasiparticle peak to even lower energies .",
    "however , transitions to pseudoscalar - meson states that are not included in the model , such as @xmath86 , would make the peak less prominent and difficult to disentangle from the other excitations . in any case , what is clear from the present approach , is that the width of the @xmath0 increases substantially in the medium , becoming , at normal nuclear matter density , five times bigger than in free space .",

    "in order to test experimentally the @xmath0 self - energy , we can study the nuclear transparency ratio by comparing the cross sections of the photoproduction reaction @xmath87 in different nuclei , and tracing the differences to the in medium @xmath54 width .",
    "the normalized nuclear transparency ratio is defined as @xmath88 the quantity @xmath89 is the ratio of the nuclear @xmath54-photoproduction cross section divided by @xmath90 times the same quantity on a free nucleon .",
    "it describes the loss of flux of @xmath54 mesons in the nucleus and is related to the absorptive part of the @xmath54-nucleus optical potential and , thus , to the @xmath54 width in the nuclear medium .",
    "we evaluate this ratio with respect to @xmath91c , @xmath92 , so that other nuclear effects not related to the absorption of the @xmath54 cancel .",

    "we observe a very strong attenuation of the @xmath7 survival probability coming from the decay or absorption channels @xmath97 and @xmath98 , with increasing nuclear - mass number @xmath90 .",
    "this is due to the larger path that the @xmath7 has to follow before it leaves the nucleus , having then more chances to decay or being absorbed .",
    "we have studied the properties of @xmath0 mesons in symmetric nuclear matter within a self - consistent coupled - channel unitary approach using hidden - gauge local symmetry .",
    "the corresponding in - medium solution incorporates pauli blocking effects and the @xmath0 meson self - energy in a self - consistent manner , the latter one including the @xmath99 decay in dense matter .",
    "in particular , we have obtained the self - energy and , hence , the spectral function of the @xmath0 meson .    we have found a remarkable change in the @xmath0 width in nuclear matter as compared to free space . at normal nuclear matter density",
    "the @xmath7 width is found to be about @xmath84 mev , five times larger than its free width .",
