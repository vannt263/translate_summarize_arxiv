    "* ) . since numerical simulations have revealed that the maxwell stress in the mri - induced turbulence is orders of magnitude larger than the viscous stress estimated from ordinary molecular viscosity , the mri - induced turbulence is believed to play a critical role in the outward angular momentum transport and subsequent mass accretion toward the central star @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear stage of turbulence in magnetized plasmas has been extensively studied via magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations .",
    "ideal mhd equations without physical viscosity and resistivity are often utilized for the numerical study of astrophysical plasma dynamics . artificial viscosity and resistivity",
    "should be explicitly added to central ( e.g. , lax - wendroff ) or operator - splitting ( e.g. , zeus by @xcite ) schemes to suppress spurious oscillations and capture shocks . on the other hand ,",
    "godunov - type schemes automatically embed sufficient numerical diffusion because of their upwind property by virtue of a riemann solver .",
    "recent godunov - type schemes such as nirvana @xcite , ramses , pluto @xcite , and athena @xcite have been designed to capture shocks and discontinuities via exact or approximate riemann solvers , and to resolve small - scale turbulence via high - order reconstruction techniques .",
    "the spatial accuracies of the fluid and magnetic field in godunov - type schemes are not necessarily identical because of the treatment of the induction equation ( divergence or curl form ) and special consideration given to the divergence - free condition for the magnetic field . @xcite",
    "have compared the accuracy of nine mhd simulation codes from a turbulence decay simulation , and they have shown that a code with high accuracy for velocity does not necessarily possess high accuracy for magnetic field , and vice versa . the numerical magnetic prandtl number that is defined as the ratio of the numerical viscosity to resistivity varies according to the applied schemes , and it can be smaller or larger than unity .",
    "the magnetic prandtl number @xmath0 determines and controls essential properties of mhd turbulence .",
    "the number relates the viscous dissipation scale @xmath1 to the resistive dissipation scale @xmath2 .",
    "for example , @xcite have argued that the kinetic energy input at the system scale cascades down to the kolmogorov dissipation scale @xmath1 , and subsequently , viscous eddies amplify small - scale magnetic fields down to @xmath3 for @xmath4 . when spitzer values are used for the viscosity and resistivity of fully ionized , weakly magnetized plasmas ,",

    "there are extreme environments that have @xmath9 ( e.g. , stellar corona , active galactic nuclei disks ) or @xmath10 ( e.g. , stellar interior , young stellar object disks ) . in such cases , there is a very wide sub - viscous or sub - resistive range over which the fluid and magnetic field are decoupled with each other .",
    "it can considerably alter the generation and dissipation processes of mhd turbulence with respect to those observed for @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite have performed numerical simulations of forced mhd turbulence , and they have shown that a small - scale dynamo with @xmath9 generates magnetic fields in the sub - viscous range .",

    "it is of critical importance to clarify effects of numerical dissipation on practical mhd turbulence problems . to this end",
    ", we conduct a large set of ideal mhd simulations of the mri .",
    "we revisit an extensive survey of the gas pressure dependence of the saturation level of the mri - induced turbulence as conducted by @xcite .",
    "our simulation reveals that the saturation level and its pressure dependence are very sensitive to the numerical magnetic prandtl number , thereby indicating the necessity of explicit viscosity and resistivity to control the magnetic prandtl number .",

    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : numerical - method ] , we describe our numerical method based on a godunov - type scheme . in section [ sec : results ] , we present simulation results .",
    "first , we assess the effect of numerical dissipation on the saturation level of the mri - induced turbulence with the ideal mhd simulation in section [ sec : norm - resol - case ] .",

    "the equations are advanced based on a technique proposed by @xcite .",
    "their technique decomposes the equations into the mhd part including the shearing source terms ( right - hand - side of equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) ) and the orbital advection part with the background shear flow @xmath24 .",
    "the latter part is advanced as simple one - dimensional linear advection equations because @xmath25 has only a @xmath26-component and is independent of @xmath26 and time .",
    "the shearing source terms are integrated by means of a second - order crank@xmath27nicholson method so as to guarantee the conservation of epicyclic motion in a discrete sense .    for the mhd part",
    ", we adopt a godunov - type scheme ( minoshima , t. , matsumoto , y. , and miyoshi , t. , in preparation ) .",
    "the scheme involves ( i ) nonlinear reconstruction of characteristic variables from cell centers to cell faces , ( ii ) evaluation of numerical fluxes dimension - by - dimension with a riemann solver , and ( iii ) update of the induction equation with a method similar to the upwind constrained transport method .",
    "the induction equation is advanced in curl form to preserve the divergence - free condition for the magnetic field in a discrete form to machine accuracy .",
    "details of this method are described in appendix [ sec : appendix1 ] . for nonlinear reconstruction",
    ", we adopt a fifth - order weighted - eno scheme ( weno ; * ? ? ? * ) or a combination of a fifth - order weno - z scheme @xcite and a monotonicity - preserving scheme @xcite .",
    "hereafter , the latter is termed as the wzmp scheme , whose accuracy is slightly better than that of the weno scheme . for riemann solvers ,",
    "we adopt the single - state harten@xmath27lax@xmath27van leer ( hll ) approximate riemann solver @xcite or the multi - state hllr approximate riemann solver @xcite .",
    "the former solver resolves the fast mode , and the latter resolves the alfvn mode as well . as is described in appendix [ sec : appendix1 ] , our simulation code can use different reconstruction functions and riemann solvers for the fluid and magnetic field .",
    "consequently , we refer to the applied scheme as f1-r1-f2-r2 , where `` f1 '' and `` r1 '' denote the reconstruction function and riemann solver for the fluid , and `` f2 '' and `` r2 '' denote those for the magnetic field , respectively .",
    "for example , the weno - hllr - wzmp - hll scheme uses the weno reconstruction and the hllr riemann solver for the fluid update , and the wzmp reconstruction and the hll riemann solver for the magnetic field update . by varying the combination of the reconstruction function and the riemann solver for the fluid and magnetic field",
    ", we assess the effect of numerical dissipation on the mri - induced turbulence .",
    "we adopt a finite volume approach .",
    "finite volume schemes require reconstruction of the numerical flux over cell faces to achieve a desired order of accuracy in multidimension ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we ignore this reconstruction for simplicity , that is , we approximate @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the physical variable and the corresponding flux , and the overline represents the average over the cell face .",
    "this approximation is inaccurate when @xmath30 is a nonlinear function of @xmath31 .",
    "it degrades the order of accuracy in multidimension even using a high order reconstruction dimension - by - dimension .",
    "we examine the order of accuracy of our scheme from the propagation of circular - polarized alfvn waves in two - dimensional homogeneous medium .",
    "the propagation angle is @xmath32 with respect to the @xmath33 axis and the plasma beta value is 0.1 .",
    "we use the weno - hllr - weno - hll scheme and the third - order tvd runge - kutta time integration @xcite .",
    "the order of accuracy of the scheme is presented in figure [ fig : awave ] .",
    "the scheme preserves fifth order of accuracy at a coarse grid size , but the accuracy becomes worse than the fourth order at a fine grid size . in this problem , the order of accuracy can be retrieved by increasing the order of the runge - kutta time integration , implying that multi - dimensional properties are somewhat incorporated by using the multi - step time integration .",
    "the similar result is obtained with the wzmp - hllr - wzmp - hll scheme .",
    "however , this does not necessarily hold for practical problems in highly inhomogeneous medium .",
    "the order of accuracy may be degraded as much as the second order . in following simulations",
    ", we use the third - order tvd runge - kutta time integration .",
    "the fourth - order time integration does not make a significant difference .",
    "@xcite have pointed out that the same high - order reconstruction function used in the computational domain is required for the remapping of variables to the shearing boundary to maintain the accuracy of the calculation .",
    "we confirm that a simple arithmetic average at the shearing boundary severely degrades the accuracy of the simulation .",
    "consequently , we remap the variables by solving the linear advection as follows .",
    "the shearing distance at the left boundary relative to the right , @xmath34 , is divided into integer and non - integer numbers of grids , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "subsequently , the variables at the right boundary @xmath37 are remapped to the left boundary such that @xmath38 .",
    "we use the same reconstruction function to shift @xmath37 with a non - integer distance of @xmath39 .",
    "the growth of the mri is very sensitive to the amplitude of the net magnetic flux .",
    "the use of the nonlinear reconstruction and the shearing periodic boundary violates the conservation of the variables @xcite . to avoid the problem , we correct the numerical flux of @xmath40 ( that is , @xmath41 ) at the shearing boundary @xmath42 in a manner similar to that adopted by @xcite .",
    "the space , time , and velocity are normalized by the system size @xmath43 , the rotation period @xmath44 , and the rotation velocity @xmath45 , respectively .",

    "high - resolution simulations with grid points of @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) are also conducted to check numerical convergence in section [ sec : convergence ] and include explicit viscosity and resistivity in section [ sec : high - resolution - with ] .",
    "the boundary condition is periodic along the @xmath26 ( azimuthal ) and @xmath51 ( vertical ) directions , and shearing periodic along the @xmath33 ( radial ) direction , respectively .",
    "the initial condition is uniform , i.e. , @xmath52 , and we impose an incompressible small random noise to @xmath53 uniformly in the @xmath54 plane and constantly in the @xmath33 direction to initiate the instability .",

    "the coefficient of this numerical diffusion , @xmath96 , is negligible for low beta @xmath97 , but not for high beta , @xmath98 .",
    "the use of single - state riemann solvers such as the lax@xmath27friedrichs and hll schemes leads to the pressure - dependent numerical diffusion of alfvn waves .",
    "multi - state riemann solvers such as the roe @xcite , hllr , and hlld @xcite schemes significantly reduce the amount of numerical dissipation because they are designed to resolve the alfvn mode as well as the fast mode .",

    "lead to the pressure - dependent numerical diffusion of alfvn waves owing to an error associated with the directional splitting ( the one - dimensional riemann solver is applied dimension - by - dimension ) .",
    "numerical diffusion of mhd turbulence is inevitable , and it depends on the plasma beta .",
    "therefore , we consider that the pressure dependence of the saturation level of the mri - induced turbulence is indistinguishable from the numerical magnetic prandtl number dependence .    to quantitatively discuss the effect of the numerical magnetic prandtl number on the saturation level of the maxwell stress , we estimate numerical viscosity and resistivity as follows .",
    "we restart simulations with @xmath99 to numerically dissipate turbulence .",

    "subsequently , it will inhibit the secondary parasitic instability because its growth rate is proportional to the amplitude of the primary mode .",
    "alternatively , @xcite have argued that non - linear multi - mode interactions by turbulent mixing , not the linear parasitic instability , is responsible for the saturation of the mri in the case when the primary mode can not reach large enough amplitudes . although the compressible case ( @xmath117 ) in our simulation is not directly applicable to actual accretion disks because the vertical size is considerably larger than the pressure scale height , @xmath148 , the simulation of the mri with relatively low plasma beta is of interest to the fundamental study of compressible mhd turbulence .",
