    "the transformation , upon charge doping , of an antiferromagnetic ( af ) mott insulator into a superconducting ( sc ) metal and the role of af correlations in the appearance of superconductivity have challenged researchers since the discovery of high-@xmath12 superconductivity in cuprates .",
    "is the af order an indispensable component or a competitor for the high-@xmath12 phenomenon ? in a prototype high-@xmath12 cuprate la@xmath6sr@xmath7cuo@xmath8 ,",
    "the long - range af order is destroyed by doped holes way before the superconductivity sets in @xcite , which has led to a general belief that the spin frustration is a prerequisite for metallic conduction and superconductivity .",
    "the destructive impact of static spin order on superconductivity was further supported by the observation of sc suppression at a peculiar 1/8 doping in la@xmath6ba@xmath7cuo@xmath8 @xcite . on the other hand , spin excitations",
    "are often suggested to provide glue for sc pairing , implying the ultimate importance of af correlations , be they static or dynamic . besides , the incompatibility of static af order and sc may be not necessarily a general feature of cuprates . in @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4",
    "( @xmath1 is a rare - earth element ) , for instance , the long - range af order survives up to much higher doping levels than in la@xmath6sr@xmath7cuo@xmath8 @xcite , though the possibility of its coexistence with superconductivity still remains to be clarified .    in strongly anisotropic high-@xmath12 cuprates",
    ", the @xmath0-axis charge transport appears to be remarkably sensitive to the spin ordering in cuo@xmath2 planes . in @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 crystals , for example , the @xmath0-axis resistivity @xmath13 exhibits a steep increase at the nel temperature @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "even relatively weak modifications of the spin structure such as spin - flop or metamagnetic transitions result in surprisingly large changes  by up to an order of magnitude  in the @xmath0-axis resistivity of both hole - doped la@xmath6sr@xmath7cuo@xmath8 @xcite and electron - doped pr@xmath15la@xmath16ce@xmath17cuo@xmath8 @xcite and nd@xmath6ce@xmath17cuo@xmath8 crystals @xcite .",
    "this sensitivity of the interplane charge transport in cuprates to the spin order can be , and actually is , employed for tracing the evolution of the spin state with doping , temperature , or magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "while electrical resistivity measurements have proved to be a very convenient tool for mapping the magnetic phase diagrams in cuprates , their usage has an obvious limitation ; namely , they fail as the superconductivity sets in .",
    "because of this limitation , previous resistivity studies of @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 crystals @xcite could not clarify whether the long - range af order vanishes by the onset of superconductivity , or extends further , intervening the sc region .",
    "it sounds tempting to employ strong magnetic fields to suppress the superconductivity and to use the @xmath0-axis resistivity technique of detecting the spin order in otherwise inaccessible regions of the phase diagram . in the present paper ,",
    "we use this approach to study the very region of the af - sc transformation in luba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 and yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 single crystals .",
    "@xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 single crystals with nonmagnetic rare - earth elements @xmath1@xmath5lu and y were grown by the flux method and their oxygen stoichiometry was tuned to the required level by high - temperature annealing with subsequent quenching @xcite . in order to ensure that no oxygen - enriched layer was formed at the crystal surface during the quenching process ,",
    "one of the crystals was dissolved in acid in several steps ; resistivity measurements detected no considerable change in the sc transition upon the crystal s surface destruction .",
    "the @xmath0-axis resistivity @xmath13 was measured using the ac four - probe technique . to provide a homogeneous current flow along the @xmath0-axis",
    ", two current contacts were painted to almost completely cover the opposing @xmath18-faces of the crystal , while two voltage contacts were placed in small windows reserved in the current ones @xcite .",
    "the magnetoresistance ( mr ) was measured by sweeping temperature at fixed magnetic fields up to 16.5 t applied along the @xmath0 axis of the crystals .",
    "a representative @xmath13 curve obtained for a luba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 single crystal with a doping level slightly lower than required for the onset of superconductivity is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "in general , the @xmath0-axis resistivity in @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 crystals of non - sc composition exhibits two peculiar features upon cooling below room temperature , both of which can be seen in fig .  1 .",
    "the first one is a pronounced crossover at @xmath19 ( @xmath20@xmath21@xmath22k for the particular composition in fig .  1 ) , indicating a change  with decreasing temperature  of the dominating conductivity mechanism from some kind of thermally activated hopping to a coherent transport @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that a similar coherent - incoherent crossover was observed in other layered oxides as well @xcite .",
    "the second feature is a sharp growth of the resistivity associated with the long - range af ordering @xcite .",
    "if the crystals were less homogeneous , the low - temperature resistivity upturn would be easy to confuse with a usual disorder - induced charge localization . however , this sharp resistivity anomaly with a characteristic negative peak in the derivative ( inset in fig .",
    "1 ) is definitely related to the spin ordering at the nel temperature @xmath14 : it has been traced from the parent compositions @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath23 with well - known @xmath14 to avoid any doubt in its origin .    , of a luba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath24 single crystal .",
    "the sharp growth of the resistivity upon cooling below @xmath25@xmath26k is caused by the af ordering .",
    "inset : anomaly in the normalized derivative @xmath27 associated with the nel transition.,width=287 ]    in carefully prepared crystals , the af transitions remain sharp for all compositions , including crystals with very low @xmath28@xmath29@xmath30k , that is @xmath3120 times lower than original @xmath32@xmath25@xmath33k in parent @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath23 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the transitions at @xmath28@xmath29@xmath30k remain virtually as sharp as in undoped parent crystals even though spin freezing into a spin - glass state is usually expected for such low temperatures and high hole concentrations @xcite .",
    "moreover , the impact of the af ordering on @xmath13 does not weaken with decreasing nel temperature ; as can be seen in fig .  1 , the resistivity of the crystal with @xmath28@xmath29@xmath34k increases by more than 50% upon cooling below @xmath14 , while in crystals with @xmath28@xmath35@xmath36k the corresponding @xmath37 growth does not exceed 15 - 20% @xcite .",
    "what do these observations tell about the impact of doped holes on copper spins ? apparently , the sharp af transitions are hard to reconcile with strongly frustrated spin states and disordered spin textures in cuo@xmath2 planes that are usually expected to emerge in cuprates with doping @xcite .",
    "besides , a strong frustration - induced reduction of the staggered magnetization @xmath38 required to account for the decrease in @xmath14 would necessarily diminish the impact of the interplane spin ordering on @xmath37 , which again disagrees with observations . on the other hand , if the role of mobile doped holes is not to introduce a uniform spin frustration , but simply to break the long - range af order into two - dimensional domains in cuo@xmath2 planes , the observed behavior is easier to understand . in this case , it is the af domains in cuo@xmath2 planes that become the elementary magnetic units and the long - range af state should develop through ordering of their phases , which can occur rather abruptly . correspondingly , the @xmath14 evolution with doping should be governed by the decreasing af domain size , rather than @xmath38 . in turn , the ordering of af domains whose local staggered magnetization does nor change appreciably with hole doping leaves room for large changes in the @xmath0-axis resistivity even at low @xmath14 .    the @xmath14 and @xmath12 values determined from the @xmath0-axis resistivity of @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 crystals have been used to establish the doping - temperature phase diagram in fig .  2 .",
    "a peculiarity of @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 crystals is that their doping level is determined both by the oxygen content and by the degree of its ordering @xcite . for characterizing the doping level ,",
    "we use therefore the in - plane conductivity @xmath39 instead of the oxygen content ; the former is a good measure of the hole density given that the hole mobility stays almost constant in the doping region under discussion @xcite .",
    "ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 ( @xmath1 = lu , tm , y ) crystals near the af - sc transformation . the af and sc transition temperatures , @xmath14 and @xmath12 , are presented as a function of the in - plane conductivity @xmath39 which is a good measure of the hole density in the shown doping region @xcite .",
    "the nel temperature was determined either at the position of the jump ( middle point ) in the derivative @xmath40 ( open circles ) , or at the position of the negative peak in @xmath40 ( solid circles).,width=326 ]    as can be seen in fig .  2",
    ", the long - range af order in @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 appears to be much more stable than in la@xmath6sr@xmath7cuo@xmath8 where it vanishes well in advance before the onset of superconductivity . in @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 ,",
    "the af phase boundary flattens upon approaching the sc compositions and hits the sc region , crossing the @xmath12 line at @xmath25@xmath41k .",
    "the observed overlap of the sc and af regions is very close to the area where @xmath42sr studies of yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 ceramics revealed the coexistence of superconductivity with spontaneous static magnetism @xcite . given that the @xmath0-axis resistivity studied here is sensitive to the _ interlayer _ spin ordering , the static magnetism detected by @xmath42sr @xcite should in fact be related to the three - dimensional af order .",
    "the superconductivity in @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 thus develops directly from the af - ordered state without any intervening paramagnetic or spin - glass region .",
    "cu@xmath3o@xmath4 single crystal for two oxygen concentrations near the af - sc transformation . for the superconducting composition @xmath43 ,",
    "the data were taken at several magnetic fields  from zero up to 16.5 t  applied along the @xmath0 axis .",
    "the sharp upturn in the resistivity associated with the nel transition shows up as the superconductivity is suppressed with the magnetic field.,width=326 ]    according to the established phase diagram ( fig .",
    "2 ) , an increase of the hole density in cuo@xmath2 planes by @xmath441% per cu ( from @xmath215% to @xmath256% , assuming the onset of superconductivity at @xmath255% doping ) turns an af @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 crystal without any sign of superconductivity into a bulk superconductor with @xmath9@xmath44@xmath45k . what happens with the af order upon entering the sc region , does it vanish abruptly ?",
    "zero - field @xmath13 curves measured on the same luba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 crystal for two hole doping levels ( that differ by @xmath250.5 - 0.6% per cu ) indeed demonstrate a switch from an af state with @xmath13 sharply growing below @xmath14 to a sc state ( fig .",
    "however , when the superconductivity is suppressed with the magnetic field @xmath46@xmath47@xmath48 , the steep increase in @xmath37 associated with the af ordering is recovered back ( fig .  3 ) . moreover , the recovered nel temperature is merely several kelvin lower than for the non - sc composition ( upper curve in fig .  3 ) and",
    "the resistivity increase is not reduced appreciably either . as long as the sc in luba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 and yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 crystals is weak enough to be killed by the 16.5-t field ,",
    "the unveiled @xmath13 curves keep demonstrating the anomalous growth below 15 - 20@xmath49k associated with the nel transition .",
    "this behavior indicates that , at least when superconductivity is suppressed with magnetic fields , the af order extends to considerably higher doping levels than the sc onset .",
    "consequently , at zero magnetic field the af and sc orders either coexist with each other in a certain range of doping , or the af order is frustrated in the sc state but revives as the superconductivity is destroyed with the magnetic field .",
    "a switching between the af and sc orders was indeed suggested based on early @xmath42sr studies @xcite , yet no further proofs were collected .",
    "the close location and even overlapping of the af and sc orders on the phase diagram raise another question of whether the af and sc orders reside in nanoscopically separated phases in cuo@xmath2 planes or coexist on the unit - cell scale , which calls for local microscopic tools to be clarified .",
