    "these quasi - one dimensional magnetic units of @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) cu@xmath6 ions belong to the most well studied spin liquids and do not evolve long - range magnetic order at finite temperatures .",
    "this mainly arises from a very effective magnetic decoupling of neighboring spin ladders due to a geometrical frustration of the magnetic spin interactions present between the ladders .",
    "the strongest antiferromagnetic ( afm ) spin - spin couplings @xmath7 and @xmath8 are expected , respectively , along the rungs and legs of the spin ladders due to almost perfect super - exchange conditions@xcite , which are responsible for interesting spin dynamics@xcite .",
    "small anisotropies in j within the ladders could also result in spin dimerization@xcite .",
    "furthermore , due to the low dimensionality of such spin - ladder materials they can act as model systems and connect theory with experiment in e.g. spectroscopy@xcite , thermal conductivity@xcite , and thermodynamics@xcite .",
    "the spin - ladder structural features are still rare in nature , but are present in the metal oxide bamn@xmath0o@xmath1@xcite .",
    "the high spin moment @xmath9 of mn@xmath6 ( @xmath10 ) represents a very different situation as for the cuprates , but theoretical work on the @xmath9 model systems predicts dimerization@xcite . here , we present a combined study of magnetism , x - ray and neutron diffraction , and thermodynamic properties on bamn@xmath0o@xmath1 .    the room - temperature crystal structure of bamn@xmath0o@xmath1  has been described by sander and mller - buschbaum@xcite and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ]  ( a ) .",
    "similar to the hexagonal @xmath11mno@xmath1 ( @xmath12  ho  lu , sc , and y)@xcite , mn has a five - fold coordination , which forms an almost perfect trigonal bipyramid .",
    "however , the relatively lower oxygen content in bamn@xmath0o@xmath1 , i.e.  the lower oxidation state of mn , forces the mno@xmath13 polyhedra to also share edges instead of only corners .",
    "this condensation is known as `` shear - planes '' in tungstenates@xcite and causes the structure to evolve double layers of edge - sharing mno@xmath13 polyhedra , perpendicular to the @xmath14 axis , with corner sharing as the only connection between these double layers .",
    "the ba@xmath6 ions fill the space between the layers and coordinate eight oxygen ions .",
    "o  mn super - exchange , however , is not governed by the double layers but by the bond angles and by the bond directions , shown in fig .  [ fig1 ]  ( b ) , which amount to 180@xmath3 [ 010 ] , 172@xmath3 [ 100 ] , 112@xmath3 [ 001 ] , and 92.3@xmath3 , which should ensure strong magnetic coupling along the rungs ( @xmath7 ) and the legs ( @xmath8 ) of each ladder , but weaker interactions between them .",
    "the mn  to  mn interactions from one ladder to the nearest - neighboring ones constitute a complete geometric frustration . by symmetry",
    "the interactions are equally strong to the two next - nearest mn@xmath6 ions in the nearest - neighboring ladder ( thick dashed lines in fig .  [ fig1]b ) .",
    "this results in a geometric frustration and in an effective decoupling of the neighboring ladders , and quasi 1d afm interactions along the [ 100 ] axis are expected to dominate the magnetic correlations of bamn@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "a single crystal of centimeter size was synthesized using a floating - zone image furnace ( fz - t-10000-h - vi - vp ) in a flowing gas mixture of n@xmath0/h@xmath0(5% ) ( 0.25  dm@xmath15/min ) .",
    "both feeding bar and seed were pressed from stoichiometric amounts of baco@xmath1 ( strem chem .",
    "99.9% ) and mno ( aldrich 99+% ) .",
    "the issue of bao loss due to a transport reaction with h@xmath0 , as was mentioned in the first paper on this compound@xcite , could to some extent be avoided by growing the crystal at a relatively high rate of 10  mm / h .",
    "indeed , the obtained crystal was covered by a thin layer of lime green crystals ( mno ) , indicating a small loss of bao , but this top layer could be removed mechanically .",
    "such a pure bamn@xmath0o@xmath1  crystal appears dark , almost black , but thinner parts reveal that the compound is transparent and dark forest - green . the pale yellow color observed in ref .   can be seen if the crystals are further crushed , reaching micrometer size .",
    "the compound decomposes slowly in air , but relatively fast in water .",
    "both reactions cause the crystal surface to become brown , probably due to formation of ramsdellite ( @xmath16-mno@xmath0 ) and barium hydroxides and carbonates .",
    "elemental analysis was performed in a scanning electron microscope sem515 ( philips ) equipped with an edx unit at 20  kv acceleration voltage .",
    "the average metal - to - metal composition was determined to be ba@xmath17mn@xmath18 from 10 edx analyses at different spots on a centimeter - sized single - crystal slice ; this very well agrees with the expected metal stoichiometry .",
    "the purity of the sample was checked by powder x - ray diffraction and no impurity phases could be detected meaning that the sample is at least 95% pure .",
    "the x - ray powder diffraction data were collected at 300  k using a cr @xmath19 x - ray tube ( @xmath20 , 2.29365 , and 2.08090   ) as source .",
    "the intensities were collected in reflection ( bragg - brentano ) geometry .",
    "single crystal x - ray measurements were performed down to 100  k with a bruker x8 apex ( mo@xmath21 , @xmath22 and 0.71359   ) ; the cooling was accomplished by using a flow of dry n@xmath0 gas ( cryoflex ) .",
    "neutron diffraction data was collected at spodi , frm ii ( munich , germany ) , with a constant wavelength of 2.537 (ge [ 331 ] monochromator ) at temperatures between 3 and 300  k. a vanadium cup was used as sample holder for the powdered single crystal sample .",
    "magnetic and specific - heat measurements were performed in a commercial physical - properties - measurement - system ( ppms , quantum design inc . ) in the temperature range 2 - 400  k in magnetic fields up to 14 t. the magnetization was measured by the vibrating - sample technique while either the magnetic field or the temperature is continuously varied . for the specific heat , a relaxation - time method is used and the data points are typically obtained step - wise after stabilizing certain temperatures . in addition , we also used a quasi - continuous modification of this relaxation - time method ( see ref .  ) in the temperature range around the first - order phase transition .",
    "thermal expansion was investigated on a home - built high - resolution capacitance dilatometer .    to ensure that the sample did not deteriorate in air ,",
    "the crystal was only handled in an ar - filled glove box and sealed in a shrink hose before performing the magnetic measurements .",
    "for all the other methods the crystals were rapidly transferred in air from the ar - filled glove box to the respective measurement setups , which work either in he atmosphere , dry n@xmath0 gas or under vacuum conditions . in none of the measurements on bamn@xmath0o@xmath1  single crystals",
    "we could observe indications for the presence of a sizeable amount of impurity phases .",
    "this was different for the neutron powder diffraction data which revealed that the studied sample contains about 3  % of mno .",
    "this impurity phase in the neutron data probably originates from the fact that the exposure to air is more severe for a powdered sample with a much larger surface - to - volume ratio than a single crystal .",
    "fig .  [ fig4 ] summarizes the magnetic measurements . between about 200 and 400  k",
    ", the magnetic susceptibility @xmath23 shows a weak anisotropy with respect to the direction of the applied magnetic field .",
    "the data of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] have been obtained after cooling the sample in zero magnetic field .",
    "the corresponding data from field - cooling experiments ( not shown ) perfectly superimpose these data for all three field directions , which rules out the existence of some type of ferromagnetic domains or a spin - glass behavior in bamn@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "for all three field directions , the temperature dependencies @xmath24 strongly deviate from a simple curie - weiss behavior .",
    "instead the @xmath24 show broad maxima which , depending on the field direction @xmath25 , are located between about 250 and 290  k. these broad maxima are typical for low - dimensional magnets and signal the continuous increase of magnetic correlations with decreasing temperature .",
    "the susceptibility data unambiguously proves the low - dimensional nature of magnetic correlations in bamn@xmath0o@xmath1 . at @xmath26",
    "k clear anomalies occur in all three @xmath24 : for a field along the orthorhombic @xmath27 axis , @xmath28 strongly decreases and levels off at a very small value at the lowest temperature , while for a field along the orthorhombic @xmath14 ( @xmath29 ) axis @xmath30 slightly increases ( decreases ) below 184  k and finally remains essentially constant below about 100  k. this anisotropic behavior is a clear indication of an antiferromagnetic ordering , where , below the nel temperature @xmath31  k , the spins spontaneously align predominantly ( anti)parallel to the orthorhombic @xmath27 axis .",
    "the low - temperature magnetization measured as functions of magnetic fields up to 14  t applied along these three field directions are shown in the inset of fig .",
    "obviously , there are neither indications of metamagnetic transitions nor of a magnetic hysteresis . instead",
    ", these data show that the low - field anisotropy observed in the temperature - dependent measurements at 1  t remains essentially preserved up to a field of 14  t. at first glance , this is a surprising observation , because for the @xmath10 configuration of mn@xmath6 the orbital contribution to the magnetic moment is typically small and consequently the magnetic anisotropy is expected to be weak . in other words , mn@xmath6 systems are expected to represent rather well the spin-5/2-heisenberg system . in this case , however , only a weak magnetic anisotropy is expected and comparatively low magnetic fields along the easy @xmath27 axis should be sufficient to induce a so - called spin - flop transition , where the spin orientation changes from being ( anti)parallel to the @xmath27 axis to a direction within the plane perpendicular to @xmath27 .    a rough estimate of the effective intra - ladder couplings can be obtained by comparing the positions of the susceptibility maxima of bamn@xmath0o@xmath1  to monte carlo simulations of @xmath32 ladders@xcite . according to these simulations the susceptibility maximum",
    "is expected to occur at @xmath33 for a homogeneous spin ladder with equal rung and leg coupling @xmath34 .",
    "thus , our data suggest an intra - ladder coupling @xmath35  k. due to the large spin value , this coupling corresponds to a very large saturation field @xmath36  t. in view of this large saturation field , the absence of a spin - flop transition in the studied field range appears less surprising , because from the present data one can only conclude that the spin - flop field @xmath37 is larger than 14  t , i.e.  @xmath38  % . within a mean - field treatment@xcite ,",
    "this can be explained already by a very weak anisotropy field @xmath39 .",
    "a closer inspection of the data in the inset of fig .  [ fig4 ] reveals a weak increase of slope in the high - field region of the magnetization curve for a field applied along @xmath27 .",
    "thus , one may speculate that a spin - flop transition could occur in the field range slightly above our maximum field . in order to clarify this issue , measurements to higher fields are necessary .    in the specific heat , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a , a pronounced anomaly appears close to 184  k , which signals a release in entropy .",
    "the specific - heat peak is slightly asymmetric , @xmath40-like , which would infer that the phase transition is of second order .",
    "however , measurements with increasing and decreasing temperature reveal a small hysteresis of @xmath41  k ( inset of fig .  [ fig3]a ) , which identifies this transition as a weak first - order one . in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b , we show the linear thermal expansion measured along the [ 001 ] direction according to the orthorhombic settings . again , a strong anomaly is observed close to 184  k , with a minor thermal hysteresis of about 0.2  k between the curves measured on increasing and decreasing temperature , in very good agreement with the results of the specific heat data .",
    "the magnitude of the thermal - expansion anomaly at @xmath42 is huge , which reveals that this magnetic ordering strongly couples to the lattice .",
    "the strong magnetoelastic coupling is also the most likely reason for the first - order nature of this phase transition .",
    "it has been shown that an intrinsically second - order phase transition can be driven to first order by a finite coupling to the lattice@xcite .    from the presented macroscopic data the behavior of bamn@xmath0o@xmath1",
    "may be summarized as follows : bamn@xmath0o@xmath1  contains 2-leg spin ladders with spin 5/2 and a rather strong intra - ladder coupling of the order of @xmath35  k as inferred from the broad susceptibility maxima around 270  k. despite this large coupling , a three - dimensional nel order is suppressed because the effective inter - ladder coupling is weak as a consequence of the geometrical arrangement of neighboring ladders that causes strong magnetic frustration .",
    "nevertheless , bamn@xmath0o@xmath1  undergoes an antiferromagnetic ordering transition at t=184  k. in order to allow for a three - dimensional nel ordering , this frustration can be lifted by a structural distortion , which then naturally explains the strong magnetoelastic coupling and the weakly first - order nature of the observed phase transition at 184  k. in order to resolve the microscopic details of these structural changes and the magnetic structure we performed single - crystal x - ray measurements down to 100  k as well as neutron powder diffraction measurements on a crushed single crystal in the temperature range from 3 to 300  k.",
    "fig .  [ fig2 ] displays the x - ray powder diffraction data obtained from a crushed piece of the bamn@xmath0o@xmath1  single crystal . the structure refinement with these data using fullprof2k@xcite yields the unit - cell parameters @xmath43   , @xmath44   , and @xmath45   , in good agreement with @xmath46   , @xmath47   , and @xmath48    reported previously@xcite .",
    "our room - temperature x - ray diffraction data perfectly agree with the already reported @xmath49 symmetry .",
    "however , the low - temperature data ( at 150 and 100  k ) of a bamn@xmath0o@xmath1  single crystal , see table  [ tab1 ] , clearly indicate a lower monoclinic symmetry @xmath50 ( see inset in fig .  [ fig2 ] ) , as choices with higher symmetries can not index all observed intensities .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , two representative neutron powder diffraction patterns are shown and the results of rietveld refinements for five different temperatures are summarized in table  [ tab2 ] . the data of fig .  [ fig5 ] reveal that the sample contains about 3  % of mno as an impurity phase .",
    "this impurity phase in the neutron data probably originates from the fact that the powdered sample was exposed to air before placing it in the vanadium cup .",
    "a partial decomposition of the sample explains this minor complication in the neutron data , but there is no evidence of an antiferromagnetic ordering transition at 118  k in the magnetic investigations , which would be expected if a significant amount of mno was present in the original single crystal as well .    according to the thermodynamic data ( see above ) , bamn@xmath0o@xmath1  orders magnetically at 184  k and , indeed , magnetic bragg peaks are visible at 180  k. simultaneously , several nuclear peaks split indicating that the symmetry is lowered , in agreement with the lowering to the monoclinic symmetry obtained from the low - temperature single crystal x - ray data .",
    "an example of the splitting is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6]a ; the two intensities , indexed as [ 152 ] ( @xmath51 ) and [ 321 ] ( @xmath52 ) in the centered orthorhombic setting ( @xmath49 ) , shift only slightly between 200 and 190  k , due to shrinkage of the unit cell , but at 170  k both peaks are clearly split and their intensities are distributed . due to the high scattering angle we may safely neglect any magnetic scattering as possible cause of the peak splitting .    the emergence of the magnetic bragg peaks upon cooling is shown for the example of the ( 1 1 -1/2)/(1 -1 -1/2 ) reflection in fig .",
    "this purely magnetic intensity develops from a diffuse scattering , which is present already at 200  k as a broad hump on top of the background intensity . at 190 k ,",
    "the diffuse scattering sharpens , which means that the spin - spin correlation length increases , and at 180  k , this peak exhibits a well - defined half width , close to that of the nuclear scattering intensities at similar scattering angle , e.g.  [ 020]@xmath53    to enable unit cell comparisons between all temperatures , the monoclinic unit cell was refined on all diffraction data and the result is shown in fig .",
    "the lattice constants @xmath27 , @xmath14 , and @xmath29 decrease continuously on cooling between 300 and 50  k , but @xmath27 changes much stronger than @xmath14 and @xmath29 .",
    "a small anomaly in the @xmath27 parameter is visible on cooling through @xmath42 . as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , the monoclinic angle @xmath54 indicates that the structure distorts below 180 k. above 200  k , the value of @xmath54 was fixed to the value calculated via the orthorhombic lattice constants , see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we show the ordered mn@xmath6 magnetic moment as a function of temperature .",
    "all magnetic bragg peaks appearing below @xmath31  k can be indexed with the propagation vector @xmath55=(0 0 1/2 ) , i.e. by a doubling of the @xmath29 axis .",
    "this means that the next - nearest neighbor ladders connected by one @xmath29-lattice spacing are ordering antiferromagnetically , whereas the next - nearest neighbor ladders connected by one @xmath14-lattice spacing are coupled ferromagnetically .",
    "the coupling along @xmath29 is mediated by the @xmath56 parameter , which the magnetic symmetry determines to be antiferromagnetic . due to the 180@xmath3 mn - o - mn bonds",
    "there is no doubt that the intra - ladder interaction parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 must be antiferromagnetic , which unambiguously fixes the magnetic order within a single ladder . with these arguments we determine the magnetic structure including the inter - ladder coupling between ladders connected by one @xmath29 or by one @xmath27 lattice parameter .",
    "what has not been discussed so far is the coupling between nearest - neighbor ladders connected by the body centering of the orthorhombic lattice ( 1/2,1/2,1/2 ) .",
    "however , the two choices of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic coupling do not result in different symmetries but only in two different domain types .",
    "choosing a ferromagnetic coupling for ( 1/2,1/2,1/2 ) yields an antiferromagnetic coupling for ( 1/2,-1/2,1/2 ) and _ vice versa_. the magnetic symmetry constructed above is monoclinic and the two domain types correspond to the common symmetry reduction from orthorhombic to monoclinic . as already discussed above , the mn moment is dominantly oriented along the @xmath27 axis and a picture of the spin structure in comparison with the ladders",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] . with this magnetic model the neutron powder - diffraction data",
    "is perfectly described .",
    "the mn@xmath6 ordered moment rapidly increases and half of the expected @xmath57 is observed already at 170  k. with further decreasing temperature , the moment further increases and finally saturates at @xmath58 close to the expected value .",
    "the role of the monoclinic structural distortion in bamn@xmath0o@xmath1  has to be discussed concerning two aspects .",
    "first , the monoclinic distortion is just a consequence of the monoclinic magnetic symmetry ; but thereby one would only expect a weak structural deformation .",
    "second , the monoclinic distortion lifts the magnetic frustration and thereby stabilizes the magnetic order in bamn@xmath0o@xmath1significantly .",
    "the nearest - neighbor inter - ladder interaction parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 are mediated via mn  o  mn bonds close to a 90@xmath3 configuration . in the high - temperature phase , both mn  o  mn angles are @xmath61 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) , which causes a perfect geometrical frustration . on cooling through @xmath42 , the structure changes from orthorhombic to monoclinic and induces an antisymmetric shift of the ladders , which changes the corresponding mn ",
    "mn angles by @xmath62 and lifts the perfect geometrical frustration . according to the goodenough - kanamori rules@xcite , a decreasing mn",
    "mn angle results in a monotonic decrease from a large antiferromagnetic coupling at an 180@xmath3 bond to a weak ferromagnetic coupling at a 90@xmath3 bond .",
    "thus one might expect @xmath60 with the larger angle of @xmath63 to be increased while @xmath59 with the smaller angle of @xmath64 to be decreased .",
    "this is , however , in contrast to our neutron data , which clearly show that the neighboring spins coupled via the larger bond angle of @xmath63 are aligned parallel ; see fig .",
    "this means that @xmath59 is larger than @xmath60 what most probably means that the minimum in the mn ",
    " mn angular dependence is located at a bond angle above 93@xmath3 .    due to",
    "the strong sensitivity of the magnetic interaction on this bond angle a sizeable magnetoelastic effect occurs in bamn@xmath0o@xmath1 , similar to the spin - peierls compound cugeo@xmath1 where dimerization mainly arises from a cu - o - cu bond - angle modulation@xcite .",
    "a similar lifting of geometric frustration through a coupled structural and magnetic transition has been reported recently for vocl@xcite and seems to be relevant in the parent phase of the iron - arsenide superconductors as well . in laofeas",
    "the magnetic order is associated with a tetragonal - to - orthorhombic transition which also has a two - fold role@xcite .",
    "it is a consequence of the lower magnetic symmetry and it lifts a magnetic frustration thereby stabilizing the magnetic order in full analogy to the discussion presented above for bamn@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "we have presented a detailed study of large single crystals of bamn@xmath0o@xmath1  grown in a floating - zone image furnace .",
    "bamn@xmath0o@xmath1  has structural motifs from both the hexagonal @xmath11mno@xmath1@xcite and the well - known spin - ladder compound ( sr , ca)@xmath65cu@xmath66o@xmath67@xcite .",
    "although bamn@xmath0o@xmath1contains spin ladders with obvious geometrical frustration , this compound shows long - range antiferromagnetic order at @xmath68  k. the magnetic ordering is accompanied by a distortion of the crystal structure , which is described by a lowering of the symmetry from orthorhombic to monoclinic .",
    "data from both specific - heat and thermal - expansion measurements clearly indicate that this phase transition shows a weak temperature hysteresis .",
    "the weak first - order feature of this magnetically driven phase transition is attributed to a strong magnetoelastic coupling .",
    "the magnetic correlations above @xmath42 are most likely confined within the ladders , which can not show long - range order due to the low dimensionality of the ( almost ) isotropic heisenberg spin system .",
    "the low dimensionality of the magnetic subsystem of bamn@xmath0o@xmath1  is a consequence of a very effective magnetic decoupling between neighboring spin ladders due a perfect geometrical frustration .",
    "experimentally , this low dimensionality is reflected by broad maxima in the temperature dependence of the magnetic suceptibility , which are located around 270  k suggesting an average intra - ladder coupling @xmath35  k. the low dimensionality is also clearly seen in the neutron diffraction data , where pronounced short - range magnetic correlations are observed already well above @xmath42 .",
    "the neutron data reveal that at @xmath42 the magnetic correlations become long - range and , in addition , there is an antisymmetric shift of neighboring spin ladders , which results in an alternation of the corresponding mn ",
    "mn angles along the ladder direction . as a consequence ,",
    "the geometrical frustration is lifted , the spin ladders become three - dimensionally coupled and , simultaneously , the magnetic subsystem develops long - range antiferromagnetic order .",
    "this indicates , that the structural phase transition from orthorhombic to monoclinic in bamn@xmath0o@xmath1  is driven by a gain in the magnetic free energy .",
