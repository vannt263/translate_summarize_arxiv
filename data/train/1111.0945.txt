    "quantum entanglement plays an important role in various quantum information tasks , such as quantum teleportation [ 1 ] and quantum computation [ 2 ] .",
    "however entangled states are always coupled with the environment due to the unavoidable decoherence . as a result of the system - environment interaction ,",
    "the pure entangled states become mixed states and therefore become quite useless for quantum information tasks [ 3 ] .",
    "multi - partite entangled states of qubits and qutrits are a central resource of quantum information science .",
    "they can be used in constructing different protocols , for example , key distribution and quantum computation [ 4 , 5 ] . during recent years , two important phenomenon ,",
    "entanglement sudden death ( esd ) and entanglement sudden birth ( esb ) have been investigated for bipartite and multipartite states [ 6 - 13 ] . in this context , yu and eberly",

    "peres - horodecki [ 16 , 17 ] have studied entanglement of qubit - qubit and qubit - qutrit states and established separability criterion . according to this criterion , the partial transpose of a separable density matrix must have non - negative eigenvalues , where the partial transpose is taken over the smaller subsystem for qubit - qutrit case .",

    "[ 18 ] have studied the esd behaviour of a qubit - qutrit system under the influence of dephasing noise .",
    "relativistic quantum information combines the tools from general relativity , quantum field theory and quantum information theory .",
    "it is a rather new and fast - growing field .",
    "it has attracted much attention during recent years to study unruh or hawking effect on the entanglement shared between inertial and non - inertial observers [ 1930 ] .",
    "however , most of the investigations in non - inertial frames are related to the study of the quantum information is an isolated system .",
    "the decoherence [ 31 ] , which appears when a system interacts with its environment in a irreversible way , can be viewed as the transfer of information from the system to its environment .",
    "it plays a fundamental role in the description of the quantum - to - classical transition [ 32 ] and has been successfully applied in the cavity qed [ 33 ] and ion trap experiments [ 34 ] .",

    "the lower and upper limits of the decoherence parameter correspond to the fully coherent and fully decohered system , respectively .",
    "different couplings of the system and the environment where the system is influenced by global and multi - local noises are considered .",
    "it is shown that the esd can be avoided in non - inertial frames in the presence of dephasing and bit - trit phase flip environments .",

    "let a composite system of qubit @xmath2 and qutrit @xmath3 is coupled to a noisy environment both collectively and globally .",
    "multi - local coupling describes the situation when the qubit and qutrit are independently influenced by their individual noisy environments . whereas , the global decoherence corresponds to the situation when it is influenced by both collective and multilocal noises at the same time .",
    "the term collective coupling means when both the qubit and qutrit are influenced by the same noise . in this study ,",
    "a particular initial state of the qubit - qutrit system is considered .",
    "the density matrix can be computed by taking into account that rob is constrained to region @xmath4 of rindler space - time , that requires to rewrite rob s mode in terms of rindler modes and then to trace over the unobservable rindler s region @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the state shared between the two parties is an unruh - rindler hybrid ( qubit - qutrit system ) entangled state as given by [ 37]@xmath6alice has a qubit and rob would have a qutrit , since for rob s mode he could have three different possible orthogonal states : particle spin - up , particle spin - down and particle pair and the minkowski - rindler modes , the subscripts @xmath7 and @xmath8 correspond to alice and rob respectively .",
    "the notation @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 correspond to spin up @xmath12 spin down @xmath13 and spin - up / down @xmath14 states respectively .",
    "let us assume that alice remain stationary while rob moves with uniform acceleration .",
    "it is important to note that rob , when he is accelerated with respect to an inertial observer of the dirac vacuum would observe a thermal distribution of fermionic spin @xmath15 particles when he observes the minkowski vacuum due to unruh effect [ 37 ] .",
    "the above state is obtained after taking the trace over unobserved region @xmath5 [ 38 ] .",
