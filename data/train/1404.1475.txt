    "over the last decades approximation of functions on the sphere has attracted the interest of many researchers . in particular",
    ", the use of zonal basis functions ( zbfs ) and spherical harmonics appears in a wide field of applications in numerical mathematics and computer science .",
    "applications can be found in approximation of scattered data , for example in geophysical and meteorological problems .",
    "these functions are of special interest , since they show several features which make them well suited for a wide range of problems and , at the same time , computationally attractive ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .    in this paper ,",
    "following the idea in @xcite , there analyzed in a global setting , we analyze a local interpolation scheme on the sphere , combining zbfs with spherical harmonics of low degree .",
    "the aim of our paper is to verify if the addition of a polynomial part in a local approach , which is based on a classical partition of unity method as the well - known modified spherical shepard s formula , allows us to improve accuracy of the considered interpolation technique .",
    "the basis of the spherical algorithm employed in the numerical experiments is the one presented and tested in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it has been modified and efficiently updated for our purposes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we consider some basic mathematical tools , referring to spherical harmonics and zbfs .",
    "section 3 is devoted to present the local shepard s method which uses zbfs phus spherical harmonics as local approximants .",
    "section 4 refers to the spherical interpolation algorithm , while in section 5 numerical results are presented .",
    "we start this section by recalling the analogue of classical polynomials on the sphere , called _ spherical harmonics _ @xcite .",
    "thus , denoting by @xmath0 the space of trivariate polynomials of degree at most @xmath1 and @xmath2 its restriction on the unit sphere , i.e. @xmath3 , we know that a trivariate polynomial @xmath4 is called _ homogeneous of degree @xmath1 _ provided @xmath5 for any @xmath6 and any @xmath7 . it is called _ harmonic _ if @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the laplace operator .",
    "then , we can define the linear space of spherical harmonics of exact degree @xmath1 as follows : @xmath10    given the laplace - beltrami operator @xmath11 on the unit sphere , the eigenvalues of the eigenvalue problem @xmath12 are @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and the space @xmath15 is precisely the eigenspace of @xmath11 correponding to @xmath16 .",
    "the dimension of @xmath15 is given by the multiplicity of @xmath16 , i.e. @xmath17 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is known that @xmath15 is the orthogonal complement of @xmath18 in the space @xmath19 with respect to the @xmath20-inner product on @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the standard measure on the sphere .",
    "using this fact repeatedly , we have that @xmath24    since the spherical harmonics form an orthonormal basis for @xmath25 , every function @xmath26 has a fourier expansion .",
    "thus , given an orthonormal basis @xmath27 for @xmath19 , the orthonormal system @xmath28 is complete in @xmath25 , and every @xmath26 has a spherical fourier representation of the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 are the spherical fourier coefficients of @xmath31 .",
    "see e.g. @xcite for further details .",
    "let @xmath32 be the set of pairs such that @xmath33 is a node and @xmath34 is the corresponding data value of an unknown function @xmath35 .",
    "so the interpolation problem consists in finding a function @xmath36 , which satisfies the interpolation conditions @xmath37 the interpolating function @xmath38 might also be expressed as a linear combination of a _",
    "zonal basis function _",
    "@xmath39\\rightarrow { \\mathbb{r}}$ ] , i.e. @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the geodesic distance , and @xmath38 satisfies the interpolation conditions ( [ condinterp ] ) .",
    "thus , we have uniqueness of the interpolation process if and only if the interpolation matrix @xmath42 , which is given by @xmath43 turns out to be non - singular . in fact , even though there is no complete characterization for those functions satisfying the non - singularity condition , we know that a sufficient condition is that the matrix @xmath44 is positive definite ( see @xcite )",
    ". moreover , the continuous function @xmath39 \\rightarrow { \\mathbb{r}}$ ] is called _ positive definite _ of order @xmath45 on @xmath21 , if , for any set of nodes , @xmath46 for any @xmath47^t \\in { \\mathbb{r}}^n$ ] . the function @xmath48 is called _ strictly positive definite _ of order @xmath45 if the quadratic form ( [ posdef ] ) is zero only for @xmath49 . if @xmath48 is strictly positive definite for any order @xmath45",
    ", then it is called _ strictly positive definite_. therefore , if @xmath48 is strictly positive definite , the interpolant ( [ intfun ] ) is unique , the matrix ( [ mat ] ) being positive definite and so non - singular .",
    "now , if we add a spherical harmonic of degree @xmath1 to a linear combination of the form ( 2 ) , the interpolant takes the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is a basis for @xmath53 .",
    "the solution of the interpolation problem in the form given in ( [ harm_interp ] ) is obtained by requiring that @xmath38 satisfies the interpolation conditions ( [ condinterp ] ) , and the additional conditions ( see @xcite ) @xmath54 this problem consists in solving a system of @xmath45 linear equations in @xmath55 unknowns .",
    "thus , assuming that @xmath56 , we have the linear system @xmath57 \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } \\textbf{a }   \\\\ \\textbf{b }   \\end{array } \\right ] = \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } \\textbf{f }   \\\\ \\textbf{0 }   \\end{array } \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is an @xmath59 matrix ( as in ( [ mat ] ) ) , @xmath60 is an @xmath61 matrix , and @xmath31 denotes the column vector of the function values @xmath34 .",
    "[ mssm_sphere ] in this section we consider a modified version of spherical shepard s method , which uses zbfs plus spherical harmonics as local approximants .",
    "this approach exploits accuracy of zbfs , overcoming some drawbacks such as instability and inefficiency of the global zbf method .",
    "now , the modified spherical shepard s interpolant @xmath62 is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a local interpolant to @xmath31 in a vicinity of @xmath65 , constructed on the restricted subset @xmath66 containing the @xmath67 nodes closest to @xmath65 and satisfying the interpolation conditions @xmath68 the weight functions @xmath69 , @xmath70 , are @xmath71 with @xmath72 the localizing function @xmath73 is @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a spherical cap of centre at @xmath65 and spherical radius @xmath76 .",
    "note that the weights @xmath77 constitute a partition of unity .",
    "as regard to the choice of nodal functions we have a wide class of zbfs , which are usually considered in the scattered data interpolation on the sphere .",
    "the nodal functions have the form @xmath78 where the zonal basis functions @xmath79 depend on the @xmath67 nodes of the considered neighbourhood of @xmath65 , and the space @xmath80 spanned by the spherical harmonics @xmath81 of degree @xmath82 has a dimension @xmath83 .",
    "thus , we require that @xmath84 satisfies the interpolation conditions ( [ iii ] ) and the additional conditions @xmath85    we remark that , considering a strictly positive definite function @xmath48 , we can generate zbfs as the specialization on the sphere of the more general radial basis functions ( rbfs ) .",
    "in fact , given any euclidean rbf , we may associate with it a zbf @xcite .",
    "an example of strictly positive definite zbf on @xmath21 is the _ spherical inverse multiquadric _ ( imq ) @xcite @xmath86 where @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 measures geodesic distance on the sphere .",
    "in this section we refer to the spherical algorithm , which is based on the partition of the sphere in spherical zones , that are portions of the spherical surface included between two parallel planes .",
    "the basis of this spherical interpolation algorithm has been proposed and widely tested in @xcite . here , it has been modified adding spherical harmonics of low degree to the local zbf interpolants .",
    "we remark that some details about the algorithm have been omitted , the interested readers can refer to @xcite .    for simplicity ,",
    "we subdivide the description of the spherical algorithm in three parts , namely distribution , localization and evaluation phases .",
    "let us consider the sets : @xmath90 , set of nodes , @xmath91 the set of the corresponding data values , and the set @xmath92 of evaluation points . then , we denote by @xmath67 and @xmath93 the localization parameters .",
    "initially , the elements of the sets @xmath94 and @xmath95 are ordered with respect to the @xmath96-axis direction , applying a _",
    "quicksort procedure_. then , for each node @xmath97 , @xmath98 , a local circular neighbourhood ( a spherical cap ) is constructed , whose spherical radius depends on the node number @xmath45 , the considered value @xmath67 , and the positive integer @xmath99 ( which determines the radius of the spherical cap ) . more precisely , we define @xmath100 after the number of spherical zones to be considered is found taking @xmath101 , the spherical zones are numbered from 1 to @xmath102 .",
    "now , we consider the following two steps :    * a suitable family of @xmath102 spherical zones of equal width ( that is , the width of the strip of the spherical zone ) @xmath103 ( possibly except for one of them ) on the sphere and parallel to the @xmath104-plane is constructed ; * the set @xmath94 of nodes is partitioned by applying the spherical zone structure into @xmath102 subsets @xmath105 , whose elements are @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 .",
    "in the searching procedure we consider three zones fo each node to be examined.(for details see @xcite ) .",
    "then , for each zone @xmath111 , @xmath110 , a spherical zone searching routine is considered , examining the nodes from zone @xmath112 to zone @xmath113 .",
    "( note that if @xmath114 or @xmath115 it will assign @xmath116 and @xmath117 , respectively . )    after defining the spherical zones to be examined for each node of @xmath105 , @xmath110 , a spherical zone searching procedure is applied to determine all nodes belonging to a local neighbourhood . here",
    ", we check whether the number of nodes in each neighbourhood is greater or equal to @xmath67 ; if the condition is not satisfied , we repeat the process increasing the value of @xmath99 in ( [ delta_z ] ) .    in the following ,",
    "all the nodes belonging to a circular neighbourhood centred at ( @xmath118 ) , @xmath98 , are first ordered by applying a quicksort procedure on the distance , and then reduced to @xmath67 .",
    "thus , taking only the @xmath67 nodes closest to the centre ( @xmath118 ) , @xmath98 , of the neighbourhood , a local interpolant @xmath84 , @xmath119 , of the form given by ( [ zonbasfun ] ) , is constructed for each node .          for each evaluation point",
    "@xmath120 , a circular neighbourhood is constructed , whose spherical radius depends on the node number @xmath45 , the parameter value @xmath93 , and the ( positive integer ) number @xmath121 , that is , @xmath122 after the number of spherical zones is determined by @xmath123 , the spherical zones are numbered from 1 to @xmath76 .",
    "then , a second family of @xmath76 spherical zones of equal width @xmath124 ( possibly except for one of them ) on the sphere and parallel to the @xmath104-plane is constructed .",
    "the sets @xmath94 and @xmath95 are partitioned into @xmath76 subsets @xmath125 and @xmath126 , @xmath127 , respectively , so that the nodes of @xmath125 and the evaluation points of @xmath126 belong to the @xmath111-th zone .",
    "a spherical zone searching procedure on the sphere is applied for each evaluation points of @xmath128 , @xmath129 , in order to find all nodes belonging to a ( local ) neighbourhood of centre @xmath97 and geodesic radius @xmath130 . in this phase",
    "the basic idea is similar to that presented above , substituting @xmath131 by @xmath132 , and @xmath133 by @xmath130 .",
    "the nodes of each neighbourhood are first ordered by applying a quicksort procedure , and then reduced to @xmath93 .",
    "thus , considering only the @xmath93 nodes closest to the evaluation point @xmath134 , a local weight function @xmath135 , @xmath70 , is found . finally ,",
    "applying the formula ( [ modsphshep ] ) , the surface can be approximated at evaluation points @xmath120 .",
    "in this section we test accuracy of the local shepard s method , which makes use of zbfs plus spherical harmonics . in doing so ,",
    "we take three scattered data sets ( @xmath136 ) obtained by using a matlab code ( see @xcite ) , which generates uniformly random node distributions on the sphere .",
    "the interpolant is evaluated on a set of @xmath137 spiral points generated by the algoritm of saff and kuijlaars ( see @xcite ) , which gives us a fairly good point distribution over @xmath21 , tracing out an imaginary spiral from the south pole to the north pole .      before analyzing numerical experiments obtained using the local interpolation scheme , we remark that the choice of the localization parameters @xmath67 and @xmath93 is of great importance , because it determines the level of accuracy of the method and the efficiency of the corresponding algorithm . anyway ,",
    "in our tests we consider a good trade - off beetween these two remarkable items , taking @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "similarly , we act to choose the value of zbf shape parameter ; indeed , we pick the mean value of the interval @xmath141 , i.e. assuming @xmath142 .",
    "specifically , this fact leads to a good comprimise between accuracy and stability .",
    "moreover , since the space @xmath15 of the spherical harmonics of degree @xmath1 has dimension @xmath143 on @xmath21 , and fixing @xmath144 as the desired degree of the spherical harmonic component of the approximation , we have that @xmath145 .",
    "it follows that the necessary condition @xmath146 imposes an upper limit of @xmath147 .",
    "thus , in the numerical experiments we take @xmath148 , where @xmath149 denotes no spherical harmonic component .",
    "even though interpolation errors are rather low also when there is no spherical harmonic component ( i.e. , @xmath150 ) , these results point out that the addition of a spherical harmonics may produce an improvement of accuracy , mainly when the value of @xmath151 increases .",
    "this effect is noted for each of the considered node sets . in figure [ m_shape_par ]",
    "we show the behaviour of the rrmses by varying the imq shape parameter @xmath152 in the interval @xmath141 for @xmath153 .",
    "finally , we also apply our local interpolation scheme to geomagnetic data , known as _ magsat _",
    "( magnetic field satellite ) @xcite .",
    "in particular , here we consider two subsets of nodes ( @xmath187 ) obtained after manipulating and refining the original magsat data , so that the distribution of each set is reasonably uniform on @xmath21 .",
    "specifically , we randomly select from the original data sets @xmath45 geomagnetic nodes for the interpolation process , taking @xmath188 points for the cross - validation . as an example",
    ", the representation of the @xmath189 nodes is shown in figure [ mags ] .",
    "then , in table [ tab1 ] we report rrmses obtained by using magsat data , taking @xmath190 , @xmath191 and @xmath140 as parameters , for @xmath192 .",
