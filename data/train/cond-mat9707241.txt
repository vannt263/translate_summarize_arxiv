    "the recent years have seen a marked progress in the debate on the mechanism of high @xmath0 superconductivity . indeed the existence of nodes and change of sign of the order parameter at the fermi surface has found a very important experimental support in some compounds like @xmath3 ( ybco ) .",
    "this includes on one hand various experiments showing the existence of low energy excited states , such as tunneling , raman scattering and penetration depth @xcite .",
    "moreover more spectacular experiments designed to probe the change of sign have given positive answers .",
    "these are the corner squid experiments @xcite and the observation of the half magnetic flux quantum in 3 grain - boundary josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "this change of sign is a clear indication that there is some important repulsive contribution in the pairing interaction .",
    "since the spin fluctuation mechanism @xcite is based uniquely on a repulsive interaction , it appears as a leading candidate for the pairing mechanism in these high @xmath0 superconductors . in its simplest version it leads to an order parameter with a @xmath4 symmetry ,",
    "commonly called d - wave order parameter .",
    "unfortunately this simple spin fluctuation interpretation meets some problems in ybco .",
    "an important one is the weak sensitivity of the critical temperature of @xmath3 to defects .",
    "any kind of impurities produces in d - wave superconductors an effect analogous to pair - breaking by magnetic impurities in standard s - wave superconductors , leading to a rapid decrease of the critical temperature with increasing scattering rate , as measured for example by the residual resistivity .",
    "this is in contrast with some experiments showing a decrease of @xmath0 an order of magnitude slower than expected @xcite .",
    "another problem is the marked anisotropy in the a - b plane shown by a number of recent experiments in ybco .",
    "the existence of a sizeable josephson current @xcite in a c - axis @xmath5 tunnelling junction shows that pure d - wave symmetry is not satisfied . because of the large size of this josephson current as compared to what would be expected from a superconductor with s - wave symmetry , it is difficult to believe that the departure from pure d - wave is only due to the small orthorhombic 1,6% distorsion of the @xmath1 planes .",
    "various other properties have also shown a clear in - plane anisotropy .",
    "the resistivity has an anisotropy of about a factor 2 .",
    "quite recently a sizeable anisotropy of the thermal conductivity has been observed @xcite which reaches 30% in the superconducting state .",
    "the anisotropy of the penetration depth is perhaps the most striking one since it is directly related to the nature of the superconducting state .",
    "indeed @xcite at zero temperature , the ratio between the superfluid densities @xmath6 is 2.3 , which is in good agreement with the anisotropy of the normal state resistivity and of the square of the plasma frequency @xcite .",
    "moreover we have also to take into account that in @xmath7 , which has twice as many chains as @xmath3 and an orthorhombic distorsion of 0.8% , the superfluid density anisotropy @xcite is as high as 6.2 .",
    "this trend points toward the natural conclusion that the chains are conducting and that the superfluid density anisotropy is due to their direct contribution .",
    "now we attribute the linear term at low temperature to nodes in the gap . since in @xmath8 this linear term is typically 3 times the linear term in @xmath9 the nodes contribution is also strongly anisotropic .",
    "this leads to the suspicion that chains have also something to do with the nodes .",
    "this is not so easy to include in the spin fluctuation picture because it deals only with the @xmath1 planes .",
    "this gives rather a strong hint that we have to include chains explicitely in our modeling of the superconducting state in order to come up naturally with such an anisotropy .",
    "another strong indication that chains play an important role in the superconducting properties comes from very recent penetration depth measurements @xcite which are partially in contradiction with earlier results @xcite , and show a kink in the temperature dependence .",
    "this seems to indicate that a two component model is appropriate for the description of superconductivity and leads again to a two band model .",
    "naturally the present overall experimental picture is still somewhat uncertain and future experiments will help to clarify the situation .    these difficulties , as well as others , with the spin fluctuation mechanism",
    "have led us to propose recently a model @xcite which allows to account for all the above experimental facts . in this model pairing in the planes is due to an attractive interaction , while coulomb repulsion induces in the chains an order parameter with opposite sign .",
    "it is well known that these plane and chain bands hybridize because electrons are physically allowed to jump from planes to chains . due to the anticrossing produced by this hybridization , one obtains automatically an order parameter which changes sign on a single sheet of the fermi surface and has nodes in the gap in the region of the brillouin zone where the anticrossing takes place . in this sense",
    "our order parameter is d - wave like .",
    "however in contrast with the @xmath4 order parameter , there is no symmetry breaking and we have a total of 8 nodes ( 4 on each sheet of the fermi surface ) instead of 4 .",
    "since the chains play an essential role in our model , it is meaningless to consider an approximate tetragonal symmetry .",
    "rather we have to consider only the orthorhombic symmetry , under which our order parameter is completely invariant ( no symmetry breaking ) , which is also the case for the @xmath4 order parameter .",
    "we can also say that on each sheet of the fermi surface our order parameter looks qualitatively like a d+s order parameter .    since the order parameter of our model has nodes , it accounts naturally for all the experiments providing evidence for its change of sign and for the existence of low energy excitations . at the same time it provides also a simple explanation for the important anisotropy in the ab plane mentionned above , because of the important role of the chains .",
    "we have found @xcite that the existence of two weakly coupled bands ( plane and chain ) in our model , as well as weak plane - chain scattering , leads to the possibility of a weak sensitivity of the critical temperature to impurities , in agreement with experiment .",
    "we find @xcitethat our model accounts quite well for the anisotropy of the penetration depth and for the absolute values .",
    "we are also able to reproduce fairly well the whole temperature dependence for both the a and the b directions found in ref.@xcite , including the linear dependence at low temperature .",
    "although our model is quite satisfactory for ybco , in part because there are strong experimental indications that chains play a significant role , it appears for the same reason quite specific of ybco and does not seem to be applicable to other compounds .",
    "however the natural tendency is to find a universal explanation for high @xmath0 superconductivity and hence a model applicable to all cuprate superconductors , since they all share fairly high @xmath0 and @xmath1 planes .",
    "on this basis our model sounds quite unsatisfactory .",
    "let us merely remark that fortunately this universality hypothesis can be checked and hopefully will be checked experimentally .",
    "we note also that the available data do not seem to confirm completely this hypothesis , since @xmath10 ( ncco ) on one hand and ybco ( for the strong anisotropy discussed above ) on the other do not fit in the picture .",
    "the case of ncco will be discussed below .",
    "it would clearly not be satisfactory to find models specific to each of the different high @xmath0 compounds , but it is possible that , while sharing common features , they also differ in some respect . a related unappealing feature of our model is its complexity , since it is basically a two band model , not as nice as a one band model . ideally one would certainly rather like to have a simple rather than a complicated model .",
    "however we already know that these compounds are chemically complicated .",
    "the same might unfortunately be true for their physics .",
    "whatever the feeling about the above issues , there remains a more practical question .",
    "other high @xmath0 compounds have been investigated experimentally and have shown features similar to the ones found in ybco ( although the experimental picture is not as complete as in ybco ) .",
    "is it possible to extend the ideas of our model and find satisfactory explanations for them ? and more generally , following these ideas , what do we expect to find in other compounds ?",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to consider this question . as we mentionned our model for ybco",
    "is basically a multiband model",
    ". therefore we will in particular consider whether a multiband model is applicable to a given compound and if this can lead to reasonable explanations for experimental facts .",
    "we note that a multiband model applies trivially in all the compounds having more than one @xmath1 plane in the elementary cell .",
    "the usual trend is to consider that this leads to almost degenerate bands and to treat them as a single band .",
    "it is not completely obvious that this is correct , but anyway this will not be our main emphasis .",
    "we will rather be interested in looking if there are bands , analogous to the chain band of ybco , that is not linked to the @xmath1 planes , which play physically an important role .",
    "naturally we do not intend to review the whole situation but only to make our best to discuss what we believe to be relevant points .",
    "our conclusion is that we can extend our model in a natural way and we do not find major incompatibility with experiments .",
    "naturally this is a somewhat imprecise statement and we will be more specific below .",
    "we consider successively the cases of bscco , hbcco , tbcco , and finally lsco and ncco .",
    "we turn first to the extension of our model to @xmath11 ( bscco ) , which is probaby the second most investigated high @xmath0 superconductor after ybco .",
    "this is not a very good compound for fundamental investigations since it is generally not stoechiometric but rather has often an oxygen  doping ",
    "@xmath12 giving the maximum @xmath0 .",
    "this comes in addition to the incommensurate distorsion arising in the bio planes .",
    "this is in contrast with ybco where the nearly stoechiometric compound has been mostly investigated .",
    "we first note the high value of @xmath13 ( which is of order 7 or even higher , as obtained from tunnelling experiment @xcite as well as from raman scattering @xcite ) gives an indication that a simple d - wave model does not properly describe bscco .",
    "this value is incompatible with a weak coupling d - wave model , and it is doubtful that strong coupling spin fluctuations calculations @xcite can lead to such a high value , because the spectrum for spin fluctuations goes to high energy and the coupling constant is of order unity . a related difficulty is the value of the slope of the penetration depth @xmath14 at low temperature @xcite . in the @xmath15 model of xu",
    "@xcite , which is an extension of the simple d - wave model allowing for a variable slope for the opening of the gap , @xmath16 = @xmath17 @xmath15 @xmath18 for 0 @xmath19 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 and @xmath16 = @xmath17 for @xmath20 @xmath19 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath21 @xmath22 the low temperature @xmath14 is given by @xcite : [ @xmath14 - @xmath23 ] / @xmath23 = ( 2 ln2 / @xmath15 @xmath17 ) t . taking the experimental value @xmath14 - @xmath23 @xmath24 10",
    "a / k and @xmath0 @xmath24 90 k , this leads to @xmath15 @xmath17 / @xmath0 = 1.5 @xmath25 @xmath23 , where @xmath23 is measured in a .",
    "there is some uncertainty in @xmath26 if we take the assumed values of 2100 a @xcite and 2600 a @xcite , we have either @xmath15 @xmath17 / @xmath0 @xmath24 3.2 or @xmath15 @xmath17 / @xmath0 @xmath24 4 .",
    "taking the ( pretty unphysical ) lower limit @xmath15 = 4 @xmath27 leads to @xmath28 / @xmath0 = 5 or 6.2 , somewhat below experiment .",
    "the standard d - wave corresponds essentially to @xmath15 = 2 and gives @xmath28 / @xmath0 = 3.2 or 4 , barely compatible with weak coupling and in clear disagreement with experiment .",
    "it might naturally be that further experiment give a higher value for @xmath23 and a lower one for @xmath13 which would solve this difficulty .",
    "the natural way to extend our two - band model to bscco is to assume that the bio planes lead to a metallic band , which would play the role of the chain - band in ybco .",
    "the existence of this band at the fermi level is controversial .",
    "there is some experimental evidence from photoemission that bio planes are insulating because the bio band is not seen @xcite , but these experiments are somewhat contradictory @xcite . similarly stm seems to indicate that the bio plane at the surface is nonmetallic @xcite .",
    "however both kind of experiments test only the surface of the sample on a few tens of a , that is basically one cell depth .",
    "just because the surface necessarily implies some kind of lattice distorsion and/or consequently some modification in the electronic spectrum , the bio planes may well be insulating at the surface while they are conducting in the bulk .",
    "it may also very well be that there is some oxygen depletion at the surface .",
    "an example of this kind of problem is found in ybco @xcite . in this compound",
    "the bands corresponding to @xmath1 planes are seen in photoemission , while the cuo chain - derived band is not seen .",
    "this could lead again to the conclusion that this chain band is nonmetallic .",
    "however this chain band is seen by acar ( which does not see the plane bands ) which shows that this band is metallic . as indicated above this",
    "is confirmed completely independently by the in - plane anisotropy of the conductivity and mostly by the strong anisotropy of the superfluid density .",
    "other problems arising with the interpretation of photoemission experiments are discussed in @xcite .    the main reason to believe that the bio planes are metallic comes from band structure calculations @xcite .",
    "indeed these papers find that , in addition to the two nearly degenerate @xmath1 plane - derived bands , there is at the fermi level a bio - derived band .",
    "the plane bands are rather similar to the ones found in ybco , and the corresponding fermi surface looks roughly as a circle centered at @xmath29 @xmath30 / a , @xmath31 @xmath30 / a ) if one uses the simplified brillouin zone corresponding to tetragonal @xmath1 planes .",
    "the bio band gives a smaller fermi surface centered at ( @xmath31 @xmath30 / a , 0 ) and ( 0 , @xmath31 @xmath30 / a ) .",
    "naturally one may wonder about the validity of band structure calculations .",
    "clearly there are limitations in the precision of these complicated calculations .",
    "they are also sensitive to the precise location of the atoms . and",
    "lda , which is commonly used to take into account correlations , is not an exact method for dealing with highly correlated systems . as a result mass renormalization due to interactions",
    "is not included and the calculations provide essentially the bare excitation spectrum ( note however that mass renormalization due to coulomb interaction seems to be rather small , from all the calculations dealing with correlation effects ) . on the other hand the results from different authors are in fair agreement , which indicates at least that the results are reasonably well converged .",
    "moreover in the case of ybco , the results are in reasonable agreement with all experimental informations from arpes , acar and dhva @xcite , including a small electron pocket centered at @xmath29 @xmath30 / a , @xmath31 @xmath30 / a ) , which is apparently not of physical importance .",
    "it is therefore difficult to ignore these results and one has to consider seriously the possibility that their conclusion is correct .    in the case of bscco",
    "the bio band is mostly above the fermi level , but the bottom of the band is located around 0.5ev below the fermi level .",
    "it is likely that the precision of the method is better than this , and the bio band will not be pushed above the fermi level by some imprecision in the calculations .",
    "therefore the existence of this bio fermi surface seems rather secure . on the other hand the calculations",
    "show a second bio band which comes quite close to the fermi level from above ( within 0.1ev or less ) , but does not cross it .",
    "it is not obvious that the precision is good enough to make sure that there is not a second bio sheet of the fermi surface .",
    "experimentally , as mentionned above , arpes does not see the bio band , but it sees the @xmath1 bands ( or at least one of them , but the failure to see two bands might be due to their splitting being very small ) .",
    "the fermi surface corresponding to this band is in good agreement with band structure calculations , which gives again confidence in these calculations . on",
    "the other hand acar @xcite gives results in fair agreement with band structure calculations and sees the bio piece of the fermi surface , although its size is somewhat larger than the theoretical prediction and the separation between bio and @xmath1 fermi surfaces larger than predicted .",
    "recent experiments @xcite on the mid - infrared reflectivity in @xmath32 have also been interpreted in terms of transitions between bio and @xmath1 type bands . as mentionned above the discrepancy with arpes",
    "might be due to the fact that the surface structure is different from the bulk .",
    "a similar problem may be seen in @xmath33 a layered perovskite becoming superconducting around 1k .",
    "here there is some disagreement between arpes @xcite and dhva @xcite experiments , and it has been suggested @xcitethat the origin might be surface relaxation of the oxygen position .    actually calling this electron pocket",
    "the bio piece of the fermi surface is a misnomer .",
    "indeed the corresponding electronic states are @xcite strong hybrid of states describing electrons moving respectively in bio planes and in @xmath1 planes .",
    "the situation is quite similar to the one found in ybco where we start with electrons belonging either to planes or chains , and which are hybridized due to the hopping of an electron from plane to chain , through the apical oxygen . in the same way we can start in bscco with ",
    "non - interacting  bands , as considered explicitely by massida et al .",
    "@xcite , corresponding to electrons moving either in bio planes or in @xmath1 planes .",
    "then hopping through the apical oxygen produces an hybridization of these bands @xcite .",
    "the net result is that @xcite the bio planes contribution to the total density of states at the fermi level is almost half of the one of the @xmath1 planes , which shows clearly the importance of bio planes .",
    "it is possible to produce semiquantitatively the results of band structure calculations with a simple tight - binding model .",
    "let us indeed consider that bscco is build by stacking up sets made of two @xmath1 planes and two bio planes .",
    "motion in the @xmath1 planes and in the bio planes is described by the dispersion relations @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively .",
    "moreover we allow hopping toward the nearest plane .",
    "we call t the hopping term between a @xmath1 plane and the nearest bio plane , t the hopping term between the two bio planes and t  the one between the two @xmath1 planes , assuming for simplicity that they are wavevector independent .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are creation operators in the @xmath1 planes bands and in the bio planes bands respectively .",
    "the indices 1 and 2 number the @xmath1 planes and bio planes , while the index n numbers the stacks . actually we can simplify further by taking into account that bscco is very anisotropic which implies that some hopping terms are quite small . from band structure calculations",
    "@xcite it is clear that hopping between @xmath1 planes and between bio planes are small , while hopping between neighboring @xmath1 plane and bio plane are somewhat stronger , leading to rather isolated @xmath1 - bio stacks . for simplicity",
    "we assume for example hopping between bio planes negligible , that is t = 0 , and t ",
    "@xmath39 0 .",
    "but we could take the opposite assumption t @xmath39 0 , and t ",
    "= 0 and reach the same qualitative conclusions .",
    "the important point is that the sets made of two @xmath1 planes and two bio planes are now independent and we have a two - dimensional problem .",
    "the hamiltonian can then be separated in two independent parts @xmath40 corresponding to even and odd combinations . introducing the operators @xmath41 and @xmath42 by @xmath43",
    "= ( @xmath44 @xmath31 @xmath45 @xmath46 and @xmath47 = ( @xmath48 @xmath31 @xmath49 @xmath46 : @xmath50 each of these hamiltonian is analogous to the two - dimensional model @xcite we have considered for ybco . for each of them",
    "the @xmath1 band and the bio band hybridize .",
    "since band structure calculations show that one of the bio derived band is pushed above the fermi level by this coupling , we consider only the other hamiltonian , where hybridization leads to an anticrossing of the fermi lines . in order to obtain a fermi surface in reasonable agreement with band structure calculations , we take for the unhybridized @xmath1 band the rather standard dispersion relation : @xmath34 - t  = - @xmath51 ( @xmath52 + @xmath53 ) + @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 - @xmath15 @xmath54 with @xmath55 = 0.33 ev , @xmath15 @xmath56 - 0.46 ev ( the axes are along the cuo bonds ) . on the other hand",
    "the unhybridized bio band can be described by a nearest neighbour tight binding approximation ( with bio bonds rotated by @xmath2 with respect to the cuo bonds ) , which leads to @xmath35 = @xmath57 @xmath52 @xmath53 - @xmath58 , with @xmath59 = 0.3 ev and @xmath58 = - 0.6 ev in order to reproduce band structure calculations .",
    "the result for the fermi lines is shown in fig.1 for t = 0.1 ev .",
    "this figure is very similar to the fermi surfaces found in @xcite .",
    "we can then take over our model @xcite for ybco and assume that there is a repulsive pairing interaction between @xmath1 plane and bio plane , leading to an order parameter with opposite sign in the @xmath1 plane and bio plane . then",
    "because of hybridization we have nodes in the anticrossing regions .",
    "to give an example we assume the regime of well separated bands , where the hopping term t is large compared to the gaps ( actually it is not clear that this condition is satisfied because the maximum gap is quite large in bscco as we have seen above , but this should not lead to qualitative changes ) . in this case , assuming for simplicity isotropic order parameters @xmath60 in the @xmath1 plane and @xmath61 in the bio plane , the order parameter is given @xcite by @xmath62 = ( @xmath60 @xmath63 + @xmath61 @xmath34 ) / ( @xmath34 + @xmath64 when hybridization is taken into account . in particular the locations of the nodes",
    "is not so sensitive to the ratio @xmath65 because the fermi lines for unhybridized @xmath1 plane and bio plane cross essentially at right angle .",
    "we show in fig.1 the locations of the nodes for @xmath65 = - 1 .",
    "we can then try to calculate the temperature dependence of the penetration depth , just as we have done for ybco @xcite .",
    "however the results depend sensitively on a number of ingredients @xcite and the situation is here much more uncertain than in ybco , in particular with respect to the band structure and the parameters describing the bio derived bands .",
    "therefore we will only consider the low temperature behaviour where the number of hypotheses can be somewhat more limited .",
    "we proceed as in @xcite and treat the hopping term t as a small quantity so that hybridization modifies the dispersion relations only in the vicinity of the crossing of the unhybridized fermi lines .",
    "this leads to : @xmath66 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the order parameters in the unhybridized @xmath1 and bio planes respectively ( which we have assumed to be * k*-independent for simplicity ) and c = 14.6 a is the thickness of the stack made of two @xmath1 planes and two bio planes .",
    "the dimensionless constant @xmath67 is related to the quasiparticle velocities at the crossing point of the unhybridized fermi lines .",
    "we assume for simplicity that these velocities are orthogonal ( this is essentially the case in fig.1 ) . in this case",
    "@xmath67 is given by @xmath67 = @xmath68 @xmath69 + @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath74 are the velocity of the unhybridized @xmath1 and bio bands respectively .",
    "this quantity has a minimum equal to 2 when @xmath60 @xmath74 = @xmath73 @xmath76 and we take for simplicity this worst case for our evaluation . expressing numerically all known physical constants , this can be rewritten in the low t regime as : @xmath77 where the all penetration lengths are now expressed in units of 1000 a and the hopping parameter t is in ev .",
    "we want now to compare this result with experiments @xcite on bscco which gives a slope of 10 a / k .",
    "we take for example @xmath65 = - 1 ( actually we would expect @xmath61 to be somewhat less than @xmath78 which would be make our case easier ) , and @xmath23 = 2000 a from experiment ( again a rather worst case hypothesis ) .",
    "if we use @xmath79 @xmath80 as discussed above , we obtain agreement with experiment for t = 0.12 ev .",
    "this result is quite similar to what we have found for ybco .",
    "it is small enough to make our hybridization approach consistent .",
    "this is quite satisfactory since we have basically no adjustable parameters . on the other hand",
    "it is not in contradiction with the strong anisotropy and the large resistivity well known in bscco , since this can be attributed entirely to the very small hopping between either the bio planes or the @xmath1 planes or both , as we have already discussed .",
    "it may seem rather strange that we can account for the rather strong slope found experimentally by a small hybridization . roughly speaking",
    "this is due to the fact that we have a total of 16 nodes in the brillouin zone , whereas the standard d - wave model has only 4 nodes .",
    "our model differs clearly from standard d - wave , not only by the number of nodes but also by their locations .",
    "this is in contrast with ybco where the location of the crossing between plane and chain bands is not so far from the @xmath2 direction of the standard d - wave model . here , in fig.1 ,",
    "the directions of the nodes are respectively @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( and all the other ones obtained by tetragonal symmetry ) , with the origin taken at @xmath83 as it is usually done .",
    "this is quite different from the @xmath2 of the d - wave model .",
    "naturally fig.1 is just an example , and it is likely that the situation in actual bscco is somewhat different because band structure ( as suggested by acar experiments ) and order parameter are not the ones we have chosen .",
    "however we do not expect the location of the nodes to change qualitatively .",
    "therefore experiments designed to ascertain the position of the nodes are quite important and we consider now briefly the evidence for this position in bscco ( we will also discuss this point below for hbco ) . at first photoemission experiments were interpreted @xcite as showing nodes at @xmath84 .",
    "taking together into account experimental and theoretical uncertainties , we would not consider this as being in clear contradiction with our model .",
    "however these experiments have then been reinterpreted @xcite as giving the nodes at @xmath2 which agrees with d - wave and disagrees with our model . anyway , as we discussed above , it is not clear at all that photoemission provides a faithfull picture of what is happening in the bulk . and it sees only a @xmath1 derived band , and no bio band .",
    "so the fact that our model disagrees with photoemission is not so surprising .    on the other hand in - plane",
    "tunneling experiments give an indication on the location of the nodes .",
    "they have shown a clear gap anisotropy @xcitewith a minimum gap along the cuo bond direction in contrast with photoemission experiments . naturally , just as photoemission ,",
    "this technique is limited in angular resolution and can not by itself display nodes , but the obvious conclusion is that the nodes of the gap are not so far from the cuo bond direction , if there are nodes at all in bscco .",
    "this is not in agreement with d - wave and more in favor of our model .",
    "finally half - integer flux quantum effect has been observed in tricrystals of bscco @xcite , providing rather convincing evidence for a change of sign of the order parameter on the fermi surface .",
    "however this experiment does not provide a unique answer for the location of the nodes .",
    "for example , although the geometry is essentially the same as the one used for ybco and is therefore consistent with d - wave , a g - wave order parameter @xmath16 @xmath24 @xmath85 is also a possible solution .",
    "more generally , since the josephson junctions ( and in particular the scattering at the interfaces ) are not controlled in the tricrystals , it seems quite difficult to be secure about the position of the nodes from this kind of experiments . in conclusion",
    "it is fair to say that the problem of locating the nodes in bscco is not at all settled . at the same time it would clearly be a crucial piece of information to know in a reliable way this location since",
    "this would definitely allow to narrow the number of possible models and be another step toward identifying the mechanism of high @xmath0 superconductivity .",
    "let us consider now the case of the hg compounds .",
    "band structure calculations give a more complex situation than for bscco .",
    "indeed the compound @xmath86 ( hg-1201 ) is found to have only a @xmath1 derived band crossing the fermi level @xcite , although there is a hgo derived band which is coming quite near ( typically 0.1 ev ) to cross also the fermi level from above .",
    "it is not clear that the precision of the calculations is enough to be certain about it .",
    "moreover the role of oxygen doping , which is held responsible for the metallic and superconducting properties of this compound @xcite , is also difficult to take into account and it seems to be quite important @xcite",
    ". therefore it will be quite interesting to see what experiment will tell in this respect .",
    "the present tunneling data @xcite are more in favor of a standard bcs density of states .",
    "this is coherent with our model since , with a single band , we expect only anisotropic s - wave pairing .",
    "however a two - band model is still an open possibility in this compound .",
    "an indication in this direction seems to be that , for hg nuclei , @xmath87 has essentially the same value at @xmath0 for hg-1201 and hg-1212 , showing a similarity between these two compounds .    indeed calculations in @xmath88 ( hg-1212 ) and @xmath89 ( hg-1223 )",
    "find @xcite the hgo derived band crossing also the fermi level , in addition to the @xmath1 bands , which makes these compounds  self - doped  .",
    "the situation is actually quite similar to the one found in bscco .",
    "the fermi surface displays a small electron pocket centered at the x point . because of hybridization between hgo and @xmath1 bands ,",
    "the electronic states on this sheet of the fermi surface have a mixed hgo - @xmath1 character , as well as those of the nearby @xmath1 bands in the vicinity of the x point . an anticrossing is clearly seen .",
    "therefore the necessary ingredients for our model are present , just as in bscco , and they can lead in the same way to nodes in the gap .",
    "experimentally raman scattering on hg-1212 @xcitegives evidence for nodes in the gap , but it shows also that some nodes ( if not all ) are away from the @xmath2 direction .",
    "this is in disagreement with d - wave and in agreement with our model .",
    "the low temperature dependence of the in - plane penetration depth in hg-1223 @xciteseems to be linear , which would indicate the existence of nodes in the gap .",
    "the available tunneling @xcite data are also suggestive of nodes . to summarize the present situation in these hg compounds is coherent with our model .",
    "we consider finally the case of the tl compounds . here again band structure calculations give results quite similar to the ones found for hg compounds .",
    "there is a tlo band which crosses @xcite the fermi level for @xmath90 with n=1,2,3 and 4 , giving rise to a small electron pocket for the fermi surface .",
    "however for @xmath91 there is some disagreement between various calculations @xcite and this result seems to be within the error bars .",
    "there are differences with hg compounds .",
    "first the electron pocket is found around the @xmath92 point .",
    "the states corresponding to this part of the fermi surface are fairly delocalized throughout the cell with contributions not only from tl and o atoms , but also from the apical o and even the @xmath93 orbital of cu atoms ( as a result , for @xmath91 @xcite , this piece of the fermi surface has a more pronounced 3-dimensional character ) .",
    "then there is also the possible existence of hole pockets @xcite , derived from flat @xmath1 bands .",
    "finally since one has always the problem of dealing with oxygen doping , compounded with the experimental uncertainty on the atomic positions , the band structure situation is quite complicated .",
    "we can again apply our model as in the case of bscco and say that coulomb repulsion will lead to an order parameter with opposite signs on the sheets of the fermi surface linked to the @xmath1 band and to the tlo band .",
    "this might explain the observation @xcite of spontaneously generated half quantum flux in @xmath94 tricrystals .",
    "nevertheless a major difference in the results of band structure calculations as compared with the bi and hg compounds is the lack of crossing of the @xmath1 and the tlo bands .",
    "therefore in our model we would not expect nodes to appear .",
    "however it might very well be that the experimental situation is in this respect slightly different from the one predicted by band structure calculations @xcite and that there is actually some crossing .",
    "this possibility has also been considered in the context of the inter - layer pairing mechanism @xcite .",
    "as we have mentionned there is enough uncertainty in the band structure calculations to allow for this possibility .",
    "clearly direct information from arpes , acar , dhva experiments would be quite useful in order to settle this question . in our model these crossings",
    "would lead to nodes in the gap , in a way analogous to what we have found in bscco and hbco . actually available raman scattering experiments",
    "@xcite favor the existence of nodes in a way very analogous to hbco since they give , in @xmath95 symmetry , a response linear in frequency at low @xmath96 in the superconducting phase .",
    "since our model requires two kind of metallic bands in the bi , hg and tl compounds , it appears important to find experimentally if we are indeed in this situation or not .",
    "this is actually rather difficult .",
    "we have already discussed this problem for bscco and found that there is no good experimental evidence against metallic bio planes .",
    "naturally one would rather like to find experiments proving definitely that they are indeed metallic , but we are not aware of any .",
    "surprisingly the ( quasi ) quadratic structure of these compounds is in this respect a disadvantage , since in the case of ybco the most reliable evidences of the metallic character of the chains come from the anisotropic properties linked to the orthorhombic structure .",
    "the difficulty comes from the microscopic nature of the information we are looking for , since for any macroscopic property we will not be able to know which one of the two bands is responsible for it .",
    "nevertheless it would seem that the nmr is an effective experiment in order to obtain this information since it is a local probe .",
    "the case of ybco is a good example of this @xcite , although it seems to be somewhat forgotten .",
    "indeed the superconducting transition is clearly seen as a strong drop both in the knight shift k and in the relaxation rate @xmath97 of cu(1 ) nuclei of the cuo chains , and the behaviour below @xmath0 is qualitatively similar to what is observed for cu(2 ) in the @xmath1 planes .",
    "this shows that there is on this cu(1 ) site a non vanishing amplitude for the wavefunction of the quasiparticles subject to the superconducting condensation .",
    "moreover the quantitative temperature dependence for cu(1 ) below @xmath0 is clearly different from the one observed for the planes cu(2 ) , both for k and @xmath97 .",
    "this shows that what is seen by cu(1 ) nuclei is not merely a transferred part of the wavefunction of quasiparticles located dominantly in the @xmath1 planes , since in this case we would expect the temperature dependence to be the same for cu(1 ) and cu(2 ) .",
    "therefore the nmr favors a two - band picture for ybco .",
    "this picture is also supported by the fact that the magnitude of @xmath97 at @xmath0 are quite similar for cu(1 ) and cu(2 ) , and the same is true for the change in knight shift between t = 0 and @xmath0 .",
    "let us consider the situation for hg compounds .",
    "@xmath98 nmr experiments have been performed recently @xciteon @xmath86 .",
    "below @xmath0 they display a strong drop both in the knight shift k and in the relaxation rate @xmath97 , so the hg nuclei see the superconducting electrons .",
    "moreover for @xmath98 , @xmath99 is essentially constant in the normal state ( the knight shift is also constant with a",
    " korringa ratio  rather near what is expected from a fermi liquid ) , whereas @xmath100 increases markedly with decreasing temperature for @xmath101 this is in favor of a two - band picture , just as in ybco .",
    "one may argue that antiferromagnetic fluctuations are responsible for the increase in @xmath102 and that these fluctuations completely cancel for symmetry reason at the hg site , so that hg has only a korringa behaviour .",
    "however this implies an antiferromagnetic coupling between different @xmath1 layers which is surprisingly strong ( taking in particular into account the disorder induced by oxygen doping in the hg planes ) . a puzzling ingredient to this question",
    "is provided by the nmr on @xmath88 @xcitewhere the temperature dependence of @xmath100 for @xmath103 and @xmath98 is nearly the same .",
    "clearly further experiments are needed to elucidate this point .",
    "finally one has @xmath104",
    "@xmath24 @xmath105 @xmath106 , but it is much more difficult to obtain firm conclusions from a comparison of the magnitude of @xmath106 and @xmath104 since we deal with different nuclei , in contrast to ybco .",
    "we turn then to the tl compounds . again in @xmath94 @xcitethe knight shift as well as the relaxation rate of @xmath107 display below @xmath0 a strong drop , which shows that the wavefunction of superconducting electrons extends in a quite sizeable way to tl nuclei .",
    "one may wonder , as for the hg compounds , if this is not due to a transferred hyperfine interaction of the hg nuclei with electrons on the cu site of the nearby @xmath1 planes through the apical oxygen .",
    "this possibility remains to be investigated in details .",
    "however , just as in the mila and rice phenomenological analysis @xcite for ybco , one expects this hyperfine coupling to occur through the contact interaction due to tl - s orbitals and therefore to be isotropic .",
    "the other contributions should be much smaller .",
    "however the spin part of the knight shift has a sizeable anisotropy ( @xmath24 30% in a @xmath0 = 110k sample @xcite ) , which is in contradiction with this hypothesis .",
    "moreover , although it is difficult to obtain firm conclusions from magnitude considerations , it is rather striking to see that the @xmath103 and @xmath107 relaxation rates are nearly the same ( @xmath108 @xmath24 20 @xmath109 and @xmath110 @xmath24 8 @xmath109 in the normal state @xcite ) .",
    "such a short @xmath111 is difficult to reconcile with a transferred hyperfine field .",
    "the natural interpretation of these @xmath107 nmr results is rather a confirmation of the two band picture given by band structure calculations .",
    "although more work is needed in order to reach a definite conclusion , we believe that the present nmr experimental evidence is leaning toward a two - band picture .",
    "however , even if we consider the single band hypothesis ( assuming that only the @xmath1 band is relevant ) , the nmr shows unambiguously that the electronic wavefunction extends in a significant way to the hg or tl sites .",
    "just as in our two band model , this provides a possible physical origin for an important coulomb repulsion within this single band .",
    "this repulsion is likely to be quite anisotropic , since the probability of finding an electron on the hg or tl site will clearly change when one moves over the fermi surface .",
    "this anisotropic repulsion might be responsible for a change of sign of the order parameter within this single band .",
    "therefore in any case the nmr provides a clear hint that the hg or tl sites can not be safely omitted in a proper description of the electronic properties of the hg or tl compounds .",
    "let us finally consider the high tc compounds , such as @xmath112 or @xmath10 , which display only @xmath1 planes without any other possible metallic component and hence provide a check for our physical picture .",
    "indeed in this case we are naturally led to a single band and naturally band structure calculations lead in these compounds to a single @xmath1 derived band @xcite . in the framework of our model we do not expect any nodes in the gap .",
    "this leads for these compounds to s - wave pairing , even if it is quite possible that the order parameter is fairly anisotropic .",
    "the experimental evidence in @xmath10 is presently clearly in favor of s - wave pairing .",
    "indeed the low temperature dependence of the penetration depth follows the standard weak coupling behaviour @xcite .",
    "tunneling @xcite gives also a fairly standard bcs shape , and moreover the eliashberg function extracted from these tunneling data leads to a @xmath0 in good agreement with experiment , providing evidence for phonon mediated attractive interaction .",
    "finally recent raman scattering experiments @xcite go also in the direction of s - wave pairing since the results can be explained by an almost isotropic gap",
    ". therefore ncco seems in contradiction with the spin fluctuation mechanism .",
    "the fact that it is an  electron doped ",
    "compound , in contrast with all the other  hole doped ",
    "compounds is a rather unconvincing explanation for this discrepancy .",
    "indeed one starts with a fermi liquid with strong spin fluctuations and it is not clear at all why a small change in doping , allowing to go from the hole doped side to the electron doped side , would kill these spin fluctuations or reduce strongly their coupling to the electrons , while at the same time a sizeable coupling to phonons would appear .    on the other hand the experimental situation is unclear in @xmath112 with some experiments in favor of s - wave and others in favor of nodes . to our knowledge there is no phase sensitive experiments , nor precise measurements of the low temperature behaviour of the penetration depth .",
    "recent raman scattering experiments @xcite have found results consistent with d - wave symmetry .",
    "however these results are not precise enough to prove convincingly the existence of nodes in the gap and some of their features do not agree with d - wave , but they display a clear anisotropy in the gap . anyway , whatever the model , an experimental conclusion giving nodes in lsco and no nodes in ncco would be quite puzzling and we would rather hope for our understanding of high @xmath0 superconductivity that both lsco and ncco fall in the same class , whatever it may be .",
    "in this paper we have proposed an extension to other high @xmath0 compounds of a model introduced earlier for ybco .",
    "this extension relies on the fact that a number of these compounds are believed to be  self - doped ",
    ", with a part of the compound giving holes to @xmath1 planes .",
    "explicitely this doping part corresponds to the bio , hgo , tlo planes in bscco , hbcco , tbcco respectively , just as it is the cuo chains in ybco .",
    "this doping part is then considered as inert or unimportant in many models .",
    "we propose instead that it is metallic , which leads naturally to a multiband model .",
    "this picture is supported by band structure calculations .",
    "naturally these calculations can not make sure that these doping bands are indeed metallic , but they make this possibility quite plausible . the final answer on this point can only be obtained from experiment .",
    "we can then take over the ingredients of our model in ybco , and assume a repulsive pairing interaction between these doping bands and the @xmath1 bands .",
    "this leads to an opposite sign for the order parameter on these bands and to nodes whenever the fermi surfaces of these bands cross .",
    "we have considered in particular the case of bscco and shown that this model accounts with reasonable parameters for the low temperature dependence of the penetration depth .",
    "an interesting feature of bscco is that the nodes are not located near the @xmath2 direction found in the d - wave model .",
    "this is in contrast with ybco where the location is not far from @xmath2 .",
    "therefore the reliable experimental determination of the node locations is an important test for our model ( we have discussed why arpes does not provide a final answer in our view ) .",
    "we have then discussed the cases of hbcco and tbcco which have not been explored as much as bscco up to now .",
    "the situation in these compounds is somewhat similar to bscco with respect to our model .",
    "we have also considered the experimental evidence given by nmr and found that there are good indications for a metallic character of the doping bands in these last two compounds , although more experimental work is needed in order to get a definite anwer .",
    "finally our model does not give nodes for ncco and lsco .",
    "this is in agreement with the present experimental situation for the first compound , but the evidence is quite ambiguous for the last one .",
    "we hope that experimental progress will allow fairly soon to confirm or invalidate our description",
    ". however whatever the answer we definitely need a consistent picture of all high @xmath0 superconductors , in agreement with all experimental data .",
