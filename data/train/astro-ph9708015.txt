    "since its discovery by penzias and wilson @xcite , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) has proved to be an extremely significant observational guide in our quest towards understanding the universe .",
    "the detection of tiny anisotropies in the cmb by the cobe - dmr group @xcite was an important milestone in the study of the universe and the understanding the large structure that we see around us .",
    "the cobe detection has opened up a fresh avenue of investigation and has been followed by a host of new developments both on the observational and theoretical fronts  @xcite .",
    "the idea of incorporating an inflationary phase in the early universe @xcite has gained wide acceptance in the last decade and is perhaps the most prevalent scenario within which one attempts to understand the universe .",
    "it was realised soon after the notion of an inflationary scenario was put forward that besides resolving some long standing problems of the big - bang model of cosmology , inflationary models also predict the form of the power spectrum of the primordial scalar metric fluctuations which could seed the formation of the large scale structures observed in the present universe@xcite .",
    "in fact , both gravity waves ( gw ) , i.e. , tensor metric fluctuations @xcite , as well as adiabatic density perturbations ( related to the scalar metric fluctuations ) arise as natural consequences of the inflationary scenario , due to the superadiabatic amplification of zero - point quantum fluctuations occurring during inflation . as gravity waves @xcite and scalar density perturbations enter the horizon , they induce distortions in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) through the sachs - wolfe effect@xcite .",
    "the relative contribution of the gravity waves and the adiabatic perturbations is linked to the specific model of inflation @xcite .",
    "the spectral index of the power spectrum of initial perturbations can be inferred directly from the cmb anisotropy measurements .",
    "the measurements of the power spectrum of cmb temperature fluctuations have till date been found to be consistent with inflationary scenarios of the early universe .",
    "in particular , the spectral index inferred from the cobe - 4year data ( see for eg.@xcite ) is consistent with the near scale - invariant spectrum of fluctuations generically predicted by inflationary scenarios .",
    "another generic prediction of inflation is that the metric perturbations generated are gaussian random fields . at the linear order",
    ", the cmb anisotropy produced would reflect the gaussian nature of initial perturbations .",
    "however , one can not apriori deny the possibility that non - linear corrections to the growth of perturbations and to the sachs - wolfe effect could induce some non - gaussian features in the cmb even for gaussian initial metric perturbations .",
    "non - zero skewness is a definite signature of non - gaussianity in a distribution . for gaussian initial perturbations",
    "the skewness in the cmb appears only beyond the linear approximation . at the leading order the skewness arises from two distinct effects .",
    "the _ first effect _ is that initially gaussian metric perturbations become non - gaussian when the lowest order nonlinearity becomes important in the course of their evolution due to gravitational instability .",
    "the non - linear component of the metric perturbations are non - gaussian and introduce non - gaussian anisotropies in the cmb through a linear sachs - wolfe relation at the corresponding order .",
    "second effect _ is that the gaussian metric perturbations introduce non - gaussian anisotropies in the cmb due to second order ( double ) scattering of the photon off the linear order metric perturbations .",
    "this arises from the second order terms in the sachs - wolfe relation .",
    "all previous discussions of skewness in the cmb , have been limited to the the estimation of only the first effect , i.e. , nonlinearity ( and consequent non - gaussianity ) due to gravitational instability @xcite .",
    "the tensor component of metric perturbations ( gw ) does not exhibit gravitational instability , consequently the possibility of non - gaussianity in the cmb caused by the gw background has been entirely ignored in previous literature .    in this paper , as an illustration of the second effect , we calculate the cmb skewness produced by a gaussian stochastic linear gravity wave background generated during inflation . in the context of @xmath0 ,",
    "flat frw models , the magnitude of the effect considered here appears to be comparable to the corresponding estimate of cmb skewness arising from the gravitational instability of scalar metric perturbations @xcite .    in @xmath1[sectwo ] , we outline the basic formalism involved in estimating the skewness in the cmb and present a very general approach for obtaining higher order corrections to the sachs - wolfe effect for a general cosmological perturbation . in the following section ( @xmath1[secthree ] )",
    "we estimate the skewness in the cmb anisotropy that would arise from a inflationary gravity wave background for a range of values of the spectral index .",
    "in this section , we outline the basic approach and present the derivations of results used in our calculation .",
    "the first part of the section contains a brief discussion of the perturbative approach used in estimating non - gaussianity in the cmb anisotropy .",
    "the second part gives a compact derivation of the cmb anisotropy arising through the sachs - wolfe effect upto second order in the primordial metric fluctuations .",
    "it is possible to address non - linear effects in the cmb within a perturbative framework by expanding the temperature fluctuations , @xmath2 , in orders corresponding to the powers of the initial metric perturbation as  :    @xmath3    given that the _ initial _ metric perturbations from inflation are _ linear _ and _ gaussian _ , any _ non - gaussian feature _ in the cmb maps can only arise from the _ higher order temperature anisotropy _ such as @xmath4 .",
    "we shall call this higher order effect  _ secondary non - gaussianity_. ( the term ",
    "secondary \" is used to denote the effects which take place after recombination .",
    "the effects prior to recombination are  primary \" . )",
    "a non - vanishing skewness is a definite signature of non - gaussianity in a distribution . at the linear order , the mean cmb skewness @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes averaging with respect to different realizations of stochastic space - time metric perturbations of the frw cosmological model which produce @xmath7 . substituting the expansion ( [ cmb_nl_exp ] ) into the expression @xmath8 ,",
    "it is clear that the leading order ( in powers of the initial linear metric perturbations ) contribution is at the fourth order ,    @xmath9    ( in this paper , we deal only with @xmath10 , and hence the superscript denoting the order has been dropped in the rest of the text ) .",
    "it is clear from the above expression that the mean skewness depends not only on the magnitude of @xmath11 but also on the extent of correlation of this term with the linear order terms , @xmath12 .",
    "for example , in the case of scalar perturbations the second order terms which arise due to the non - linear evolution of density perturbations grows linearly with the expansion of the universe and can attain values @xmath13 at late times @xcite .",
    "however , in a flat @xmath14 universe , the linear order term contributes only close to the surface of recombination ( @xmath15 ) and the second order term attains its largest value only at late times ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "consequently in the final result for the mean skewness , the decay of correlation between the linear and the second order term over this large physical separation ( @xmath17 ) along the line of sight attenuates the effect of the growth of the second order term , leading to a very modest value for @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "it was also pointed out in the same paper that the mean skewness which arises due to weakly non - linear density perturbations is expected to be somewhat larger in models where the linear gravitational potential changes at late times leading to a significant linear order integrated sachs - wolfe contribution at late times ( eg .",
    "cdm+@xmath19 , @xmath20 models ) .    even in a flat @xmath21 universe ,",
    "contribution to linear order integrated sachs - wolfe effect comes from inflationary tensor perturbations ( gravity waves ) .",
    "consequently , one expects that the correlation between the linear and second order terms is not attenuated in this case leading to larger values of @xmath18 .",
    "the second order @xmath11 in the case of gravity waves comes only from double scattering since gw do not exhibit any gravitational instability .",
    "scalar perturbations also give rise to second order anisotropy through double scattering .",
    "however , for flat , @xmath21 models the contribution to the mean skewness is expected to be even smaller than that from gravitational instability considered in @xcite .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that @xmath22 from double scattering too has contributions only at late times implying attenuated correlation with the linear term contribution close to the surface of recombination .      in a perfectly isotropic universe",
    "the cmb would have the same temperature in all directions on the celestial sphere . if , however , the cosmological metric is perturbed , the temperature observed today fluctuates over the celestial sphere .",
    "the dominant contribution at large angular scales ( @xmath23 ) to the observed temperature fluctuations comes from the change in the frequency of any cmb photon as it travels from the surface of last scattering to us . ) . ] in the case of an isotropic universe , the overall increase in the scale factor @xmath24 redshifts the entire planckian distribution of photons leading to a planckian distribution at a lower temperature given @xmath25 .",
    "the presence of the perturbations @xmath26 , produces an additional change in the frequency and direction ( momentum ) of a photon as it moves in and out of the fluctuating metric perturbations .",
    "we consider the trajectory of a photon ( or ray ) in a perturbed flat frw universe and work in a synchronous coordinate system where the line element is of the form    @xmath27    in the above , @xmath28 ) is the metric perturbation , and @xmath29 is a small number characterizing the amplitude of deviations from the unperturbed background frw universe .",
    "the photon trajectory can be obtained by perturbatively solving the eikonal equation for the phase @xmath30 .",
    "the eikonal equation for a photon propagating in a spacetime with metric , @xmath31 , is    @xmath32    ( analogous to the hamilton - jacobi equation for a massive particle ) .",
    "the frequency and the direction of the photon can be obtained from the phase @xmath30 using @xmath33    retaining terms to order @xmath34 when inverting the metric given by the line element in equation.([pmetric ] ) , the eikonal equation  ( [ eikoneqn ] ) becomes    @xmath35    where we use the background spatial metric @xmath36 to raise and lower the spatial indices .",
    "the phase @xmath30 can be expressed in a perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath37 , as @xmath38 and substituting the above in equation ( [ eikoneqn ] ) we obtain the zeroth order equation @xmath39 the first order equation @xmath40 and the second order equation @xmath41    the solutions to these equations correspond to a family of rays ( or null geodesics ) in a perturbed frw universe .",
    "the solution to the zeroth order solution is @xmath42    this corresponds to a family of trajectories for the photons with frequency @xmath43 moving in the @xmath44 direction . in figure",
    "[ fig ] , we show some of these trajectories for the case where @xmath45 is along the @xmath46 axis ( the @xmath47 direction has not been shown ) .",
    "the observer o sits at the origin of the spatial coordinate system and measures the frequency of the photons at the present epoch @xmath48 .",
    "using @xmath49 as a parameter along the rays , this family of rays can be expressed as @xmath50 and @xmath51 with the condition that @xmath52 is perpendicular to @xmath44 . here",
    "different values of @xmath53 correspond to different rays and @xmath54 corresponds to the ray that the observer o sees at present traveling in the @xmath44 direction .    substituting the first order solution in equation ( [ eq : a4 ] ) , we rewrite the lhs as a derivative along the zeroth order trajectory , i.e. , with respect to the parameter @xmath49 as @xmath55 which can be easily integrated to obtain the first order solution , @xmath56    the frequency of the photon is given by the time derivative of @xmath57 given by equation ( [ eq : a7 ] ) . at the point",
    "a ( refer to figure  [ fig ] ) the time derivative is the @xmath58 limit of @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the difference in @xmath61 between the points b and a.    the point a lies on the trajectory @xmath62 , @xmath63 and it corresponds to a value @xmath64 for the parameter @xmath65 . the point b lies on a different trajectory @xmath62 , @xmath66 and it corresponds to the same value of the parameter i.e. , @xmath64 .",
    "we then have @xmath67 which leads to    @xmath68    similarly , in the direction parallel to @xmath44 ( the @xmath69-axis in fig.[fig ] ) , the spatial derivative is given by limit @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the difference in @xmath69 between the points c and a. c lies on a trajectory @xmath62 , @xmath72 and it corresponds to the value of the parameter @xmath73 .",
    "we obtain @xmath74 and the spatial derivative in the direction parallel to @xmath44 reads @xmath75 \\;.\\ ] ]    in the direction perpendicular to @xmath44 we have    @xmath76    substituting the derivatives of @xmath57 in the second order equation  ( [ eq : a5 ] ) and using @xmath77 to denote the spatial derivative in the direction perpendicular to @xmath44 we obtain @xmath78    the perturbative solution for @xmath79 can now be used to obtain the frequency of a photon at any point along its trajectory . although we are interested in a photon that leaves the last scattering surface at @xmath80 and reaches the observer at @xmath48 , it is convenient to consider a photon traveling backwards in time from the observer to the last scattering surface . keeping terms upto order @xmath81",
    "we find that the photon that is observed at the frequency @xmath82 left the last scattering surface with the frequency , @xmath83 invert the above relation we find that a photon which left the last scattering surface with the frequency @xmath84 will have frequency @xmath85 when it reaches the observer .",
    "this relates the observed frequency to the emitted frequency and the metric perturbations . using equations  ( [ eq : z1 ] ) and ( [ eq : z2 ] ) we obtain expressions for the fractional change in the frequency of the observed photon relative to the frequency that would be observed if the universe were unperturbed .",
    "since the cmb photons have a planckian distribution , ( frequency independent ) fractional changes in frequency translates to fluctuations in the temperature characterizing the distribution .",
    "at the linear order we recover the familiar ( linear order ) sachs wolfe effect @xmath86    at the second order the expression for fractional change in cmb temperature reads @xmath87}^2 .",
    "\\label{eq : a8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the expression for @xmath88 has been independently obtained by other methods @xcite .",
    "the @xmath89 calculated here is the fractional increment ( or decrement ) with respect to the cmb temperature that would be observed in a homogeneous and isotropic universe . in practice",
    "an observer would measure the fluctuations in the cmb temperature from different directions in the sky and in order to relate our calculation with what is observed we have to remove any monopole component in the angular distribution of the calculated @xmath89 .",
    "in addition , the dipole component of @xmath89 is usually interpreted as arising from the observers peculiar motion and this is removed before relating the observed @xmath89 to the primordial fluctuations .    in most previous work on second order cmb anisotropy ,",
    "only the term depending on @xmath90 arising from nonlinear gravitational instability of scalar density perturbations in the above expression for @xmath88 has been considered .",
    "the nongaussianity from the @xmath90 term in @xmath88 for @xmath91 models has been considered in reference @xcite .",
    "the @xmath90 term in @xmath88 for @xmath92 models has been calculated in reference @xcite to calculate the fourth order corrections to the power spectrum of cmb anisotropies .",
    "gravitational waves can be decomposed into two polarization states denoted by @xmath93 and @xmath94 , and the metric perturbation corresponding to a gravitational wave with wavelength @xmath95 traveling in the @xmath96 direction can be written as @xmath97 where the quantity @xmath98 is the power spectrum of the gw perturbations .",
    "the temporal evolution of the modes of the gravity waves in a @xmath91 , matter dominated frw universe is given by @xmath99 where @xmath100 denotes the spherical bessel function of order one .",

    "we substitute the expression ( [ eq : b2 ] ) for the gw metric perturbation in equations ( [ eq : b4 ] ) and ( [ eq : a8 ] ) to calculate the temperature fluctuation in the cmb at the first and second orders , respectively . at the linear order",

    "we subtract this contribution from the second order temperature fluctuation predicted by equation ( [ eq : a8 ] ) .",

    "the cosmic variance , @xmath139 , for the case of a cmb anisotropy arising from gravity waves is given by @xmath140 .",
    "the cosmic variance for the scalar case is around @xmath141 times smaller @xcite . the cosmic variance is larger as the power spectrum tilted away ( reddened ) from scale invariance for both scalar perturbations and gravity waves .",
    "it is clear that _ in principle _ the secondary skewness in the cmb for a cdm model ( @xmath21,@xmath142 and @xmath143 ) is _ unobservable _ since it is below the cosmic variance .",
    "in this work we study a possible source of secondary non - gaussianity in the cmb and reexamine whether initial gaussian metric perturbations ( as expected from inflation ) should lead to a gaussian cmb anisotropy .",
    "we point out that besides nonlinear gravitational instability , secondary non - gaussianity can be induced in the cmb maps due to multiple scattering of cmb photon off metric perturbations .",
    "we develop a general method for calculating cmb temperature fluctuations beyond the linear order and calculate the expression for cmb temperature fluctuations at the second order . as an example of skewness from multiple scattering",
    ", we estimate the skewness in the cmb that is expected to arise due to a relic inflationary gravity wave background .",
    "we show that the magnitude of the effect studied here is comparable to the ones considered in existing literature .",
    "however , the signal is much smaller than its cosmic variance and we conclude that gaussian initial perturbation from inflation leads to a gaussian statistics for the observed temperature fluctuations",
