    "this paper is the second in a series presenting high - redshift quasars selected from the commissioning data of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) . in paper i ( @xcite )",
    ", we presented the discovery of 15 quasars at @xmath1 selected from two sdss photometric runs covering @xmath10 deg@xmath3 in the southern galactic cap along the celestial equator observed in fall 1998 . in this paper , we describe observations of quasar candidates selected in a similar manner from 250 deg@xmath3 of sdss imaging data in the northern galactic cap , again along the celestial equator , observed in spring 1999 .",
    "the scientific objectives , photometric data reduction , selection criteria and spectroscopic observation procedures are described in paper i , and will be outlined only briefly here .",
    "we have not yet observed all the quasar candidates spectroscopically , so the objects described in these two papers do not form a complete sample .",
    "we will present the complete sample of high - redshift quasars found in the equatorial stripe , and derive the quasar luminosity function at high redshift , in subsequent papers .",
    "we describe the photometric observations and selection of quasar candidates briefly in  2 .",
    "the spectra of 22 new high - redshift quasars are presented in  3 .",
    "the sdss telescope ( @xcite ) , imaging camera ( @xcite ) , and photometric data reduction ( @xcite ) are described in paper i. briefly , the telescope , located at apache point observatory in southeastern new mexico , has a 2.5 m primary mirror and a wide , essentially distortion - free field .",
    "the imaging camera contains thirty @xmath11 photometric ccds , which simultaneously observe 6 parallel @xmath12 wide swaths , or _",
    "scanlines _ of the sky , in 5 broad filters ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 ) covering the entire optical band from the atmospheric cutoff in the blue to the silicon sensitivity cutoff in the red ( @xcite ) .",
    "the photometric data are taken in time - delay and integrate ( tdi , or `` drift - scan '' ) mode at sidereal rate ; a given point on the sky passes through each of the five filters in succession .",
    "the total integration time per filter is 54.1 seconds .",
    "the data were calibrated photometrically by observing secondary standards in the survey area using a ( now decommissioned ) 60 cm telescope at apache point observatory and the us naval observatory s 1 m telescope .",
    "the photometric calibration used in this paper is only accurate to 510% , due to systematics in the shape of the point spread function across individual ccds , and the fact that the primary standard star network had not yet been finalized at the time of these observations .",
    "this situation will be improved to the survey requirement of 2% in future papers in this series .",
    "thus as in paper i , we will denote the preliminary sdss magnitudes presented here as @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , rather than the notation @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 that will be used for the final sdss photometry .    in this paper",
    ", we select quasar candidates from four sdss imaging runs in the northern galactic cap . the data were acquired with the telescope parked at the celestial equator .",
    "details of the photometric runs are summarized in table 1 .",
    "two interleaved sdss scans , or the northern and southern _ strips _ , form a filled _ stripe _ 2.5 degrees wide in declination , centered on the celestial equator . run 77 and 745 cover the northern strip of the equatorial stripe , while runs 85 and 752 cover the southern strip .",
    "runs 77 and 745 , and runs 85 and 752 have considerable overlap , but candidates were selected only on the catalogs based on individual runs .",
    "the total stripe is roughly 7 hours long and covers a total area of about 250 deg@xmath3 at galactic latitude in the range @xmath23 .",
    "all four nights were photometric , with seeing conditions varying from @xmath24 to worse than @xmath25 .",
    "the data are processed by a series of automated pipelines to carry out astrometric and photometric measurements ( c.f .",
    "paper i , and references therein ) .",
    "the final object catalog includes roughly 5 million objects in total .",
    "the limiting magnitudes are similar to those of paper i , roughly 22.3 , 22.6 , 22.7 , 22.4 and 20.5 in @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "figure 1 presents the color - color diagrams from run 752 for all stellar sources at @xmath5 .",
    "the inner parts of the diagrams are shown as contours , linearly spaced in density of stars per unit area in color - color space .",
    "as in paper i , a source is plotted only if it is detected in all three of the relevant bands at more than 5@xmath26 .",
    "in addition , objects that are flagged as saturated , lying on the bleed trail of a saturated star , overlapping the edge of the image boundary , or showing other indications of possible problems in the photometric measurement , are rejected .",
    "the median tracks of quasar colors as a function of redshift , as well as the locations of low - redshift ( @xmath27 ) quasars , hot white dwarfs and a stars , all from the simulation of @xcite , are also plotted in figure 1 .",
    "high - redshift quasar candidates were selected using color cuts similar to those presented in paper i. because of the uncertainties in the photometric zeropoints , we found that the stellar locus shifted by of order 0.05 mag in the color - color diagrams between the fall ( paper i ) and spring observations .",
    "we adjust the color cuts presented in paper i according to these shifts .",
    "final color cuts of the complete sample will be presented in a later paper with the final photometric calibrations .",
    "the color selection criteria used in this paper are as follows :    \\1 .",
    "@xmath28 candidates , selected principally from the @xmath29 diagram :    @xmath30    \\2 .",
    "@xmath31 candidates , selected principally from the @xmath32 diagram :    @xmath33    the intersections of those color cuts with the @xmath34 and @xmath35 diagrams are illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "a total of 80 @xmath28 and @xmath31 candidates that have colors consistent with quasars at @xmath1 and @xmath36 were selected from the catalog .",
    "several other @xmath31 candidates ( @xmath37 ) at @xmath5 were also selected and observed .",
    "two of the candidates , sdssp j105320.43001649.3 and sdssp j111246.30 + 004957.5 ( see table 2 ; for naming convention , see  3 ) , are the previously known quasars bri10500000 ( @xmath38 , @xcite ) and bri1110 + 0106 ( @xmath39 , @xcite ) .",
    "those two objects are the only quasars with @xmath1 in the area covered in the ned database .",
    "spectra of 32 high - redshift quasar candidates from the equatorial stripe were obtained with the arc 3.5 m telescope of the apache point observatory , using the double imaging spectrograph ( dis ) , during a number of nights from march to may 1999 .",
    "exposure times of these candidates range from 600 seconds for the brightest ( @xmath40 ) candidate to 5400 seconds for the faintest candidates .",
    "the instrument and spectral data reduction procedures were described in paper i. the final spectra extend from 4000   to 10000  , with a spectral resolution of 12   in the blue and 14   in the red . they have been flux calibrated and corrected for telluric absorption with observations of f subdwarfs ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "twenty - one of the candidates are identified to be high - redshift quasars at @xmath1 . in particular , five of the candidates",
    "are quasars at @xmath37 , with redshifts of 4.62 , 4.69 , 4.70 , 4.92 and 5.03 , respectively .",
    "two of these objects have very unusual spectra .",
    "+ sdssp j153259.96003944.1 is identified as a quasar without detectable emission lines at @xmath4 .",
    "its optical , radio , and polarization properties are reported in a separate paper ( @xcite ) .",
    "sdssp j160501.21011220.0 is a broad absorption line ( bal ) quasar at a redshift of 4.92 with two bal systems , and is described further below .",
    "one additional object , sdssp j130348.94 + 002010.4 , was also observed .",
    "it has redder @xmath41 and @xmath42 colors than required by our color selection criteria ( eq .",
    "1 ) , but is identified as a bal quasar at @xmath43 . we present its spectrum below but will not include it in the future statistical analyses .",
    "table 2 gives the position and sdss photometry , the redshift of each confirmed sdss quasar and the photometric run from which it was selected .",
    "for the objects in the overlap region between runs , only the results from the runs from which they are selected are listed .",
    "none of these quasars show magnitude differences of more than 0.2 mag in the high signal - to - noise passbands between runs .",
    "we also include the sdss measurements of the two previously known @xmath1 quasars in table 2 .",
    "the naming convention for the sdss sources is sdssp j hhmmss.ss@xmath44ddmmss.s , where `` p '' stands for the preliminary sdss astrometry , and the positions are expressed in j2000.0 coordinates .",
    "the preliminary sdss astrometry is accurate to better than @xmath45 in each axis .",
    "the photometry is expressed in asinh magnitudes ( @xcite , see also paper i ) ; this magnitude system approaches normal logarithmic magnitudes at high signal - to - noise ratio , but becomes a linear flux scale for low signal - to - noise ratio , even for slightly negative fluxes .",
    "the photometric errors given are statistical in nature and do not include the systematic errors due to psf variation across the field and uncertainties in the photometric zeropoint .",
    "positions of the 24 confirmed sdss quasars on the color - color diagrams are plotted on figure 1 .",
    "finding charts of all objects in table 2 are given in figure 2 .",
    "they are @xmath46 @xmath16 band sdss images with an effective exposure time of 54.1 seconds .",
    "we matched the positions of quasars in table 2 against radio surveys .",
    "twenty of them are in the region covered by the first survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "three of them have first counterparts at 20 cm at the 1 mjy level ( with positional matches better than @xmath47 ) .",
    "two new sdss quasars , sdssp j123503.04000331.8 ( @xmath48 ) and sdssp j141205.78010152.6 ( @xmath49 ) , correspond to first sources of 18.4 and 4.3 mjy at 20 cm , respectively .",
    "one of the previously known quasars , sdssp j105320.43001649.3 ( bri1050 - 0000 , @xmath50 ) , is also a first source of 13.8 mjy .",
    "the three quasars with ra @xmath51 are not covered by the first survey .",
    "we matched them against the nvss survey ( @xcite ) ; none of them has an nvss counterpart at 20 cm at the 2.5 mjy level .",
    "we have similarly cross - correlated the list against the rosat full - sky pixel images ( @xcite ) ; none of these objects were detected , implying a typical 3-@xmath26 upper limit of @xmath52 in the 0.1  2.4 kev band .",
    "this result is not unexpected ; only a few @xmath53 quasars have an observed x - ray flux above this value ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , and the typical x - ray flux from known optically selected @xmath53 quasars is a factor of four or more lower than our limit ( @xcite ) .",
    "we expect positive rosat x - ray detections of a substantial fraction of the somewhat brighter , lower - redshift quasars in the sdss",
    ".    among the 34 observed candidates which satisfy equations 1 and 2 ( including the two previously known quasars ) , 23 are confirmed as quasars at @xmath1 , a success rate of 68% , similar to the success rate we reported in paper i. ten of the eleven non - quasars are faint late type stars , which are typical contaminants of high - redshift quasar searches .",
    "one of the candidates , however , has spectral features that we have not yet been able to identify ; we will present its spectrum and discuss possible explanations in a separate paper .",
    "figure 3 presents our spectra of the 22 new sdss quasars . in figure 3",
    ", we place the spectra on an absolute flux scale ( to compensate for the uncertainties due to non - photometric conditions and variable seeing during the night ) by forcing the synthetic @xmath21 magnitudes from the spectra to be the same as the sdss photometric measurements .",
    "the synthetic and photometric measurements agree within @xmath54 mag for the objects observed in photometric nights .",
    "this scatter is due to both the uncertainties in the sdss photometric zeropoints ( 5  10% , see  2 ) and the spectroscopic observations .",
    "therefore , the absolute flux scale in figure 3 is only accurate to @xmath54 mag .",
    "the emission line properties of the quasars are listed in table 3 .",
    "central wavelengths and rest frame equivalent widths of five major emission lines are measured following the procedures of paper i. table 4 gives the continuum properties of the quasars .",
    "as in paper i , redshifts are determined from all emission lines redward of ly@xmath55 ; ly@xmath55 itself is not used , due to absorption from the ly@xmath55 forest on its blue side .",
    "the ab magnitude of the quasar continuum at 1450   ( rest frame ) , @xmath56 , is determined by the average flux in the continuum window from 1425   to 1475   ( rest frame ) from the spectra in figure 3 . the absolute magnitude @xmath57 is determined by assuming a cosmology of @xmath8 , @xmath7 , and a power law index of 0.5 following schneider , schmidt & gunn ( 1991 ) .",
    "the @xmath58 and @xmath57 magnitudes are corrected for galactic extinction using the reddening map of @xcite ; these values are accurate to @xmath54 mag , due to the uncertainties in the absolute flux scale ( see above ) .",
    "the emission and absorption properties of most of these quasars are very similar to those of other quasars at similar redshift ( c.f .",

    "the determination of an accurate redshift is not straightforward .",
    "a straight gaussian fit to the ly@xmath55 emission line yields a redshift of 5.14 .",
    "the si@xmath63iv and c@xmath63iv emissions are affected by atmospheric absorption ; they give a consistent redshift of about 5.03 .",
    "we therefore adopt a redshift of 5.03 @xmath44 0.05 for this quasar .",
    "for these two @xmath61 quasars , the differences between the redshifts of the ly@xmath55 lines and that of the si@xmath63iv and c@xmath63iv lines are about 0.1 , much larger than other quasars at @xmath53 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is not clear whether the lyman @xmath55 absorption at the blue wing of the lyman @xmath55 emission line can fully account for this large redshift discrepancy .",

    "although this object is a marked outlier in sdss colors , it is redder in @xmath41 and @xmath68 ( perhaps because of the bals ) than the great majority of other known high - redshift quasars , and does not satisfy our formal selection criteria ( eq .",
