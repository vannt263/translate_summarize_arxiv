    "even in the setting of infinite dimensional dynamics many of the dynamical objects of interest are low dimensional , e.g.equilibria , periodic orbits , connecting orbits , horseshoes , etc . in this paper",
    "we introduce techniques which , in principle , allow for the rigorous verification of such solutions for a wide variety of partial differential equations .",
    "our approach is to combine rigorous computer calculations with topological invariants to obtain accurate existence statements . to demonstrate these techniques we have chosen to study the the kuramoto - sivashinsky equation @xcite @xmath2 subject to periodic and odd boundary conditions",
    "@xmath3 the following theorem is a prototype for the results which can be obtained .",
    "[ thm : proto ] let @xmath4 where the @xmath5 are given in table  [ table : coef ] .",
    "then , for @xmath6 there exists an equilibrium @xmath7 for ( [ eq : ks ] ) such that @xmath8 . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     what should be clear at this point is that the uncertainty contributed by the terms not in the galerkin projection are extremely small . obviously , at this point",
    "most of the uncertainty is due to the size of @xmath9 .",
    "having controlled the errors from the galerkin truncation , the next step is to obtain an isolating block @xmath10 which is topologically self consistent with @xmath9 and @xmath11 . in determing",
    "@xmath10 we use the vector field ( [ eq : ksgal22 ] ) .",
    "of course , the correct equations are given by ( [ eq : ksfodd ] ) : @xmath12 using corollary  [ cor : tailest ] one obtains the following bounds on the errors , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 \\quad{\\rm and}\\quad \\epsilon_2=[-1.544 \\cdot 10^{-8},0.0697171].\\ ] ]    thus , the equations for which the isolating neighborhood should be found are @xmath16 the construction of the isolating block around @xmath17 is easier if one works in coordinates determined by the eigenfunctions of the linearized equations at the fixed point .",
    "the eigenvalues are @xmath18 with corresponding unit eigenvectors @xmath19 let @xmath20 be the affine change of variables from @xmath21 in this new basis to the original variables @xmath22 . then",
    ", on the set @xmath23 ( [ eq : ksgal22err ] ) becomes @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are polynomials containing only terms of degree two and @xmath27 , @xmath28 are obtained from @xmath29 , @xmath30 by the transformation @xmath20 . in particular , @xmath31   , \\quad { \\tilde \\epsilon_2}=[-0.0764461,0.00397075]\\ ] ]    set @xmath32 ^ 2 $ ] , then @xmath33 .",
    "thus , an isolating block @xmath34 ( which satisfies the error constraints ) will give rise to an isolating block @xmath35 such that @xmath10 , @xmath9 and @xmath11 are topologically consistent .",
    "since for each @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 thus , by theorem  [ thm : fixedpoint ] , there exists the desired fixed point in @xmath39.\\ ] ]    thus , all that remains is to construct @xmath40 . in the @xmath41",

    "before beginning this section we want to once again emphasize that the proofs of the theorems in this paper are in principle independent of this section . on the other hand , good initial guesses greatly improve the speed of convergence .",
    "the estimates described in what follows apparently provide excellent initial values for the self - consistent bounds .",
    "we will follow the arguments from @xcite to produce estimates for errors in the galerkin projection .",
    "kuramoto - sivashinsky can be written in the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 while @xmath48 , it is still the case that @xmath49 to simplify the notation , let @xmath50      we will make use of the following inequality ( * ? ? ? *",
