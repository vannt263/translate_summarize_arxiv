    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics  @xcite is the current best quantum ",
    "relativistic theory describing the electromagnetic , weak and strong interactions .",
    "it is an elegant model built in the context of quantum field theory , with symmetries playing a major role in its formulation . despite the fact that the sm has survived to high  precision experiments during many years",
    ", the high energy physics community is nowadays convinced that the sm is not the most fundamental theory depicting nature , as there exist physical phenomena which do not find an explanation within it .",
    "this is the case , for instance , of gravitational interaction , massive neutrinos , and the experimental evidence that our universe is mostly consituted by some exotic substances known as dark matter and dark energy .",
    "moreover , renormalizability of the sm  @xcite , which is in important issue if one assumes that the sm is all there is , crucialy depends  @xcite on the existence of a scalar particle , the higgs boson , which has not been observed in nature so far . by considering the sm as a good approximation , valid up to our current experimental sensitivity",
    ", the pursuit of a theory of everything can be achieved in mainly two ways .",
    "one consists in proposing an ambitious model , which is supposed to be fundamental , and then trying to connect it , under certain circumstances , with the sm , as it occurs , for instance , in the case of string theory .",
    "of course , the lack of experimental evidence for very high energy phenomena makes this path quite difficult and much work has to be done on the theoretical side .",
    "another , more economical , track that could shed light on the question of the most fundamental theory is accompished by establishing _",
    "sm extensions _ and see if they are capable to explain some issues out of the reach of our current low  energy picture .",
    "if a given sm extension reconciles experiments with theory , then some clues on the fundamental theory should arise .",
    "there are interesting sm extensions in the market , and those that rely on the existence of extra dimensions are presently among the most popular ones . extra ",
    "dimensional models became phenomenologically interesting , some years ago , when it was realized that the size of extra dimensions could be in the tev@xmath6 range  @xcite .",
    "since then , a plethora of works concerning extra dimensions has appeared , leading to interesting physical implications such as a lower gauge  couplings unification scale  @xcite , in the supersymmetric context , and a solution to the hierarchy problem  @xcite .",
    "one of the main motivations of extra  dimensional models is string theory , which supposes that the full spacetime , which is known as the _ bulk _ , has eleven spacetime dimensions where our three  dimensional space , usually called _",
    "3brane _ , is embedded .",
    "the easiest way to propound an extra  dimensional model is taking the already known fields and define all or some of them to propagate in the bulk .",
    "the scenario in which _ all _ of the fields propagate in the extra dimensions is known as the _ universal extra dimensions _",
    "@xcite ( ued ) framework .",
    "with respect to the interesting new physics generated by ued models , it is worth commenting that they provide  @xcite dark matter candidates .",
    "these models have been also employed to develope new mechanisms for generating  @xcite neutrino masses and supressing  @xcite proton decay .",
    "thinking about extra dimensions , one could ask : what is the character of them ? currently , there is no experimental evidence indicating that they actually exist , so there is plenty of room to build extra  dimensional models with different features .",
    "models with _ spatial _ extra dimensions are the ones favored in the literature  .",
    "the compactification of extra dimensions is a crucial point of extra dimensional models , for it is an experimentally consistent way to explain why we have not detected them so far .",
    "this is achieved by assuming that the extra dimensions do not extend infinitely , but are _ compactified _ and their size is small enough to render them invisible to present  day experiments .",
    "the propagation of particles in such finite dimensions furnishes the corresponding extra  dimensional fields with periodicity properties that allow one to expand the fields in fourier series with respect to the extra  dimensional coordinates . such series , also known as _ kaluza ",
    "klein _ ( kk ) _ towers _ , involve infinite sets of fields that receive the name of _ kk modes _ and that can be divided into two types : the _ zero modes _ , which are the fields appearing in the first term of each kk tower , and which are identified with the sm fields ; and the _ excited modes _ , which are associated to the other terms in the fourier series and correspond to new four  dimensional particles .",
    "the confinement of fields within the finite extra dimensions quantizes the allowed states , so that the masses of the kk modes are highly degenerated .",
    "this is analogous to the case of the infinite  well potential that is studied in elementary quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "the compactification of extra dimensions also introduces a parameter to the theory , namely , the size of the extra dimensions , so that all physical quantities built from extra  dimensional models are expected to depend on it .    in this thesis work",
    ", we consider an @xmath7invariant yang ",
    "mills theory defined in a spacetime manifold with one flat ued , which we compactify on the orbifold @xmath0 with radius @xmath8 .",
    "mills theory  @xcite has great physical interest , for it is used to suitably describe the strong and electroweak interactions with the complicity of symmetry .",
    "hence , investigating its five  dimensional generalization and the physical implications generated by it on low  energy physics is , of course , worthy . through the rest of this paper , the ordinary four ",
    "dimensional coordinates will be labeled by @xmath9 and the extra dimension will be represented by @xmath10 .",
    "capital letters indices will run over the five components of the five  dimensional spacetime ( @xmath11 ) , while greek indices will take values corresponding to the ordinary four  dimensional coordinates ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "gauge group indices will be represented by lower ",
    "case letters ( @xmath13 ) . the five  dimensional yang  mills lagrangian",
    "is defined as @xmath14 where the curvatures @xmath15 are given by @xmath16 in the last expression , the five  dimensional gauge fields were denoted by @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the five  dimensional coupling constant with units of @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the structure constants associated with the @xmath7 gauge group .",
    "it is well known that extra  dimensional theories are not renormalizable , for they involve coupling constants with inverse  mass dimensions .",
    "this indicates that the extra  dimensional yang ",
    "mills theory does not incarnate a fundamental theory , but only a formulation valid up to certain energy scale , @xmath21 , above which nature behaves according to a fundamental description , which could be , perhaps , string theory .",
    "in fact , the nonrenormalizable behavior of this description implies that the extra  dimensional theory is not even valid for an arbitrarily large energy range . in connection with that ,",
    "an analysis of the running of the coupling constants , within the context of the sm with one ued , has shown  @xcite that @xmath22 .",
    "the effects of the fundamental theory within the range of energies between the compactification scale @xmath23 and the physical cutoff @xmath21 can be parametrized through an effective lagrangian expansion .",
    "as the five  dimensional theory is nonrenormalizable , there is no limit for the number of invariants that can be included in the lagrangian .",
    "this has been utilized , for instance , to introduce  @xcite lorentz violation in extra dimensions in the same way that it is done in the sm extension  @xcite . in the present work",
    "we do not pay attention to such effects .",
    "the full effective theory can be written as  @xcite @xmath24 where the @xmath25 are operators of canonical dimension higher than five that are invariant under the five  dimensional lorentz group as well as under the @xmath7 gauge transformations .",
    "the @xmath26 coefficients are dimensionless factors that quantify the effects of the fundamental theory at the extra  dimensional level provided one considers energies below the @xmath21 scale . the mass dimension of each term is regulated by appropriate powers of the dimensionful coupling constant @xmath18 and the inverse of the fundamental scale @xmath21 .",
    "the suppression introduced by the fundamental scale is important because it renders  @xcite these effects dominated by those of the extra dimensions . by orbifold ",
    "compactifying the extra dimension , the effective theory described by eq.([full5deff ] ) produces the kk theory @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 generically and respectively representing all the zero modes and excited modes , and where @xmath30 as it has been indicated in the last expression , the @xmath31 term , whose dynamic variables are the kk modes , was produced by the five  dimensional yang  mills lagrangian after integrating out the fifth dimension .",
    "the appropriate expansion of covariant objects ( the curvatures ) in eq.([l5ym ] ) implies that @xmath31 is invariant under two types of infinitesimal gauge transformations  @xcite .",
    "the first set of such variations are the _ standard gauge transformations _",
    "@xcite ( sgt ) , under which the zero modes transform as gauge fields .",
    "the other sort of local gauge transformations receive the name of _ nonstandard gauge transformations _",
    "@xcite , and the fields transforming as gauge fields under them are kk excited modes . the second term in the right  hand side of eq . ( [ leff4 ] ) is a sum of terms containing nonrenormalizable operators constituted by kk modes , both zero and excited ones . as the mass dimension of such objects is higher than four , the factors @xmath32 control the total canonical dimension of the terms .",
    "the dimensionless @xmath33 coefficients parametrize the effects of the physical description of nature beyond the @xmath21 scale at the low  energy level , at which the kk modes are the dynamic variables .",
    "the quantization of gauge systems requires the fixation of the gauge , for leaving such degeneration would render the path integral divergent , since a set of physically equivalent trayectories , related to each other by gauge transformations , whould be taken into account .",
    "after the explicit breaking of gauge symmetry through the election of a particular gauge , what remains is the so  called _ becchi  rouet  stora  tyutin _ ( brst ) symmetry  @xcite .",
    "this is a global symmetry that naturally arises within the field ",
    "antifield formalism  @xcite .",
    "the quantization within the brst approach comprehends the gauge  fixing ( gf ) procedure , which enters in a nontrivial way and comes along with the consistent determination of the most general faddeev ",
    "popov ghost ( fpg ) sector . as the kk theory emerged from the five  dimensional yang ",
    "mills lagrangian is a gauge theory , the brst approach is a suitable tool to consistently quantize it .",
    "once this step has been performed , two terms are added to the kk lagrangian @xmath31 , namely , the _ gauge  fixing _ lagrangian , @xmath34 , and the _ faddeev  popov ghost _ term , @xmath35 .",
    "as the sgt are defined exclusively by the zero modes of the gauge parameters , while the nsgt are determined only by the kk excitations of such parameters , the gf procedure for this theory can be split into two independent parts .",
    "one can fix the gauge for the kk excited modes and leave the gauge degeneracy associated to the kk zero modes . after that one can , if desired , fix the gauge for the remaining gauge fields . calculation of extra  dimensional effects on low ",
    "energy physics requires only to quantize the kk excited modes and consider the zero modes as classical fields . in relation with that , it is worth emphasizing that the first corrections to sm observables from extra dimensions , in the ued framework , enter  @xcite since the one  loop level , while no tree  level corrections to such quantities exist .",
    "this is a consequence of so  called kk number conservation  @xcite , which is characteristic of ued models .",
    "the effective lagrangian then reads @xmath36 here , @xmath37 is used to denote the _ gauge  fixing parameter _ , whose different values correspond to different choices of the gauge .",
    "the last term in eq.([leffcompleto ] ) is a sum of nonrenormalizable operators suppressed by the compactification scale and by the fundamental physics scale as well .",
    "the powers of these objects are such that the mass dimension of any complete term is four .",
    "each of these terms also includes a dimensionless parameter , @xmath33 , that bears quantitative information about the effects of the fundamental description at low energy . as the kk excitations are heavier than the zero  mode fields , the most important terms in this series are those that involve no other fields than the zero modes .",
    "for that reason , we disregard , in what follows , those parts of the fourth term of eq.([leffcompleto ] ) involving kk excited modes . by integrating out the kk excitations in the other terms ,",
    "one obtains  @xcite an effective lagrangian expansion that depends only on zero  mode gauge fields .",
    "schematically , the result of this process is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the ordinary four  dimensional yang  mills lagrangian .",
    "the second term is a series constituted by operators of mass dimension higher than four , whose building blocks are low  energy fields ( kk zero modes ) and low  energy symmetries ( four  dimensional lorentz and @xmath4 ) .",
    "this sum of nonrenormalizable invariants is equivalent to a sum of light green s functions with one  loop quantum corrections introduced by the kk excited modes .",
    "as the heavy kk modes that have been integrated out are gauge fields , the coefficients @xmath40 muliplying the nonrenormalizable operators parametrize the effects of extra  dimensional physics in a gauge  dependent manner .",
    "of course , it is expected that the gf parameter vanishes when a physical quantity is constructed .",
    "note that the factors of powers of the compactification radius , @xmath41 , supress the extra  dimensional effects on light green s functions , as the size of the extra dimension is assumed , on the grounds of experimental consistency , to be small .",
    "the presence of such factors also shows explicitly that the extra  dimensional contributions decouple for a large compactification scale ( or a small compactification radius ) , which is consistent , for the well known renormalizability of the yang  mills theory  @xcite sets  @xcite the required conditions for the decoupling theorem  @xcite to be fulfilled .",
    "it is worth commenting that the effective lagrangian @xmath42 , eq.([leffintegrated ] ) , permits one to compare  @xcite the effects of the extra dimension with those from the fundamental description beyond the cutoff @xmath21 , and the result is  @xcite that the latter are negligible with respect to the former .",
    "this asseveration was already pointed out  @xcite and , recently , phenomenologically illustrated  @xcite by comparing the one  loop contributions to the @xmath43 and @xmath44 vertices produced by the extra dimension with those provided by the parametrization of the fundamental physical description at the tree level .",
    "this result , eq.([leffintegrated ] ) , also proves that the one  loop level effects from the kk excited modes on light green s functions are  @xcite renormalizable , which had been shown before in the literature  @xcite by following a different path .",
    "it occurs that the divergencies originated in the loop integrals are _ eaten _ by the parameters of the low  energy theory and are , consequently , unobservable .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the necessary framework to perform the integration of kk excited modes is established and discussed in chapter  [ 5dymt ] .",
    "the full discussion includes the derivation of a kk theory , with especial emphasis on the nature of gauge symmetry , and the quantization of the kk excited modes , within the brst approach .",
    "chapter  [ kkint ] deals with the integration of the kk excited modes and the determination of an effective lagrangian comprehending the one  loop effects of these heavy fields on light green s functions .",
    "the calculation is performed first in the feynmant hooft ( fth ) gauge and then in the @xmath5 gauge .",
    "also , a comparison among the effects of extra  dimensional physics and physics related to a fundamental description is carried out .",
    "finally , the conclusions are presented in chapter  [ conclusions ] .",
    "consider a five  dimensional spacetime manifold and assume that the extra dimension , which we suppose to be spatial , is flat .",
    "take the five  dimensional yang ",
    "mills lagrangian @xmath45 , which was defined in eq .",
    "( [ l5ym ] ) and whose dynamic variables are gauge vector fields with five components , @xmath46 which we utilize to define the five  dimensional field strengths @xmath47 as usual .",
    "this gauge theory is governed by the five  dimensional lorentz symmetry and by the @xmath7 gauge symmetry as well . according to gauge symmetry , the transformations @xmath48 with @xmath49 representing the gauge parameters and @xmath50 , vary the @xmath15 covariantly and leave the @xmath45 lagrangian invariant . from the viewpoint of the brst formulation ,",
    "the gauge parameters coincide  @xcite with the ghost fields and hence personify dynamic variables of the theory , at the same level of the gauge fields . as the extra dimension is universal",
    ", the gauge parameters must then propagate in it .",
    "this is moreover consistent with five  dimensional lorentz invariance .",
    "one could , of course , consider a five  dimensional yang ",
    "mills theory in which the gauge parameters are constrained to live in our ordinary four  dimensional spacetime , but the physical implications of such framework are less interesting  @xcite . for this reason we will not consider such possibility in the present work .",
    "as experiments have not observed any signal that suggests the existence of extra dimensions , it is necessary to introduce a mechanism to render this description experimentally consistent , and compactification is a rather elegant way to do it .",
    "the main idea is that the extra dimension does not extend infinitely , as those of our known ordinary four  dimensional world , but it is limited to a finite region",
    ". then the size of the extra dimension is assumed to be small enough so that their effects have been so far innocuous to our experiments .",
    "a physically suitable scheme , which we will follow to compactify the extra dimension , is the compactification on the orbifold @xmath0 , which we describe now .",
    "we suppose that the extra dimension closes in itself , forming a circle of radius @xmath8 .",
    "after that , we impose a @xmath51 symmetry on the extra dimension , which identifies every point @xmath10 of the extra dimension with its negative counterpart @xmath52 . the resulting extra dimension , which is said to be compactified on the orbifold @xmath0 with radius @xmath8 , is an interval with two singularities .",
    "there is interesting physics concerning such singularities  @xcite , but we will not disscuss this issue in the present paper .",
    "the radius @xmath8 , which carries the information of the size of the extra dimension , determines a compactification scale , @xmath23 , from which the physics of the extra  dimensional extension enters as the valid physical theory describing nature beyond the standard theory .    the orbifold compactification provides the fields and gauge parameters of the theory with periodicity properties with respect to the extra dimension , @xmath53 and allows one to endow the gauge fields with the parity properties to be even under extra coordinate reflection is the base of the so  called gauge ",
    "higgs unification models  @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath54 under reflection of the @xmath10 coordinate .",
    "note that the lagrangian @xmath55 is invariant under these parity transformations . on the other hand ,",
    "the behavior of the five  dimensional gauge parameters under parity can be derived  @xcite from the parity transformation properties of the gauge fields by appealing to five  dimensional gauge symmetry , which leads to the conclusion that @xmath56 the dynamic variables of the theory can then be expanded in fourier series as @xmath57 where the indices between parentheses are mode numbers labeling the terms of the expansions .",
    "these expansions are known , in the high energy physics terminology , as kk towers .",
    "the most remarkable feature of the kk towers is the presence of an infinite set of fields that receive the name of kk modes .",
    "the kk modes depend , exclusively , on the four  dimensional spacetime coordinates , while all the dependence on the fifth coordinate is located in the arguments of the trigonometric functions of the expansions .",
    "the fields in the first term of each of the kk towers are known as _",
    "zero modes _ and are identified as the low  energy fields .",
    "for instance , in the context of the sm colour group these light fields correspond to the known sm gluons .",
    "the fields in the rest of the terms of the expansions are called _ excited modes _ , and they represent new particles predicted by the theory . at energies not too far beyond the compactification scale , the dynamic variables of the theory are the kk modes , but as one explores higher energies , the compactification of the extra dimension should become unnoticeable and the dynamic variables should be the five  dimensional gauge fields .",
    "a profound feature of the kk towers of the gauge parameters is that such fourier decompositions engender an infinite number of gauge parameters propagating in the four  dimensional spacetime . as each of these gauge parameters",
    "should define a gauge transformation , an infinite set of gauge transformations is expected to manifest .",
    "this means that the compactification of the extra dimension comes along with a severe modification of the gauge structure of the extra  dimensional theory .",
    "this assertion can be better understood by recalling that gauge and lorentz symmetries live strongly connected to each other in a nontrivial way .",
    "the compactification procedure implies the election of a prefered direction in the five  dimensional spacetime and hence produces an explicit breaking of lorentz symmetry .",
    "such breaking deeply affects gauge symmetry through its symbiotic link with lorentz symmetry .    in the context of ued , the objects to kk expand are  @xcite the covariant objects @xmath47 instead of the fields @xmath17 , as such a procedure preserves  @xcite enough gauge symmetry to consistently produce a gauge transformation per each kk mode of the gauge parameters .",
    "the parity and periodicity properties of the five  dimensional gauge fields imply analogous transformation properties of the field strenghts , that is , @xmath58 such properties allow one to kk  expand these five  dimensional curvatures as @xmath59 as the dependence on the extra  dimensional coordinate is totally embedded in trigonometric functions , the extra dimension can be trivially integrated out in the action , @xmath60 which produces the four  dimensional kk effective lagrangian @xmath61 .",
    "the precise form of the kk lagrangian @xmath31 is  @xcite @xmath62 where any pair of repeated indices , including the modes ones , indicates a sum .",
    "notice that the well  defined parity of the five  dimensional field strengths and the orthogonality of trigonometric functions ensure that no mixings among different kk modes of curvatures appear .",
    "the expressions of the kk curvatures in terms of the kk modes of the five  dimensional vector bosons can be straightforwardly determined  @xcite by employing the parity and orthogonality properties of trigonometric functions .",
    "the recipe is simple : kk  expand the components of the five  dimensional curvature , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , in terms of the kk vector bosons by utilizing eqs.([kkamu ] ) and ( [ kka5 ] ) ; equalize the resulting expressions to eqs .",
    "( [ kkfmunu ] ) and ( [ kkfmu5 ] ) and obtain @xmath65 @xmath66 where @xmath67 are , respectively , the four  dimensional yang  mills field strength and the covariant derivative in the adjoint representation of the @xmath4 group , and @xmath68 is the dimensionless coupling constant of the four  dimensional yang ",

    "energy structure ensures that the ordinary four  dimensional yang",
    " mills theory is contained in the kk lagrangian @xmath31 , and suggests that the kk theory is governed by the @xmath4 gauge group .",
    "the latter asseveration is indeed incomplete , for the gauge symmetry of the kk theory turns out to be richer , as we will see in the next section .",
    "one of the main features of the four  dimensional kk lagrangian @xmath31 is , doubtless , gauge symmetry .",
    "some authors  @xcite attempted to find the appropriate gauge transformations governing the kk theory emerged from the five  dimensional yang ",
    "mills lagrangian . however , they did not succeed , as they did not pay attention to the crucial role played by the gauge parameters .",
    "the first consistent discussion on the issue of gauge symmetry was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was pointed out that the assumption of gauge parameters propagating in the extra dimension invariably requires the kk expansion of covariant objects instead of five  dimensional gauge fields .",
    "this approach to perform kk expansions has been recently extended  @xcite to the whole five  dimensional standard model .",
    "the determination of the explicit form of the gauge variations governing the kk theory is crucial because they enter as an essential ingredient of the quantization procedure .",
    "they also carry valuable information about the nature of the fields of the theory , which can yield important phenomenological consequences  @xcite .",
    "the deduction of the gauge transformations of the kk theory can be achieved in , at least , three different manners  @xcite .",
    "one of them is analogous to the derivation of the kk curvatures that we carried out in the last section .",
    "another one follows from the dirac s method  @xcite , which gives additional information of the gauge structure of the theory .",
    "finally , they can be derived from the brst transformations . through the next two sections",
    ", we will discuss the obtainment of the gauge transformations of the kk theory by using the first and the second paths .",
    "consider the five  dimensional gauge variations @xmath79 which gather all necessary information to determine the four  dimensional gauge  symmetry transformations . by substituting eqs.([kkamu ] ) , ( [ kka5 ] ) and ( [ kkgp ] ) , and then executing an analysis similar to the one used to find the kk curvatures , the gauge transformations of the kk theory are straightforwardly obtained .",

    "notice that these variations transform the zero modes as @xmath4 gauge fields , while the remaining fields are transformed as matter fields in the adjoint representation of the group .",
    "this behavior , which is consistent with the fact that the kk zero modes correspond to the ordinary four  dimensional yang ",
    "mills fields , has given  @xcite this transformations the name of _ standard gauge transformations _ ( sgt ) .",
    "now consider the case in which the zero modes of the gauge parameters are equal to zero ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "the resulting transformations , which receive  @xcite the name of _ nonstandard gauge transformations _ ( nsgt ) , are given by @xmath88 the nature of the fields under this set of gauge transformations differs from that with respect to the sgt . under these variations ,",
    "the zero modes do not behave as gauge fields , but they transform in a way that resembles the transformation in the adjoint representation of the @xmath4 group , but involving an infinite sum of kk modes .",
    "the form of the variations of the excited  modes fields @xmath3 under the nsgt indicates that these fields are gauge fields under such transformations .",
    "the transformation rule of the scalar fields @xmath89 involves the object @xmath83 , which does not contain derivatives , so that these fields do not behave as gauge fields .",
    "consider the particular gauge transformation defined by taking the excited modes of the gauge parameteres to be  @xcite @xmath90 . in this context , the scalars transform under the nsgt as @xmath91 .",
    "this result is very important , as it explicitly proves that there exists a specific gauge such that the kk scalars @xmath89 can be eliminated from the theory .",
    "these scalars are indeed pseudo ",
    "goldstone bosons that are generated by the breaking of five  dimensional gauge symmetry that comes along with the compactification of the extra dimension .",
    "in fact , within this election of the gauge , note that @xmath92 so that such gauge fixing not only removes the scalars from the theory , but also defines the mass of the excited kk gauge bosons , as it occurs in the higgs mechanism .",
    "this means that the degrees of freedom of the scalars have been eaten by the excited kk gauge fields , which in this manner have become massive .",
    "this is why we call this fields pseudo",
    " goldstone bosons .",
    "it is an interesting feature of the kk theory that the excited modes @xmath3 are massive fields transforming as gauge fields ( under the nsgt ) .      in this subsection",
    "we employ the dirac s method , which allows us to derive the gauge trasformations shown in eqs.([zmgt ] ) , ( [ emgt ] ) and ( [ pgbgt ] ) .",
    "these transformations can be then used to define the sgt and the nsgt , as we showed in the preceding section . in the mean ,",
    "we derive the constraints of the theory , and once the first class constraints are known , we will define the castellani gauge generator  @xcite and use it to determine the gauge transformations .",
    "the generalized momenta of the theory are given by @xmath93 with the dotted fields representing velocities . by taking the index @xmath94 as spatial ,",
    "say , for instance , @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) , these momenta produce some defined velocities : @xmath97 on the other hand , the case of a time index , @xmath98 , leads to the following primary constraints : @xmath99 with the superscript ",

    "the primary hamiltonian is given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are lagrange multipliers and the hamiltonian density @xmath104 is given by @xmath105 by imposing consistency conditions on the primary constraints , @xmath106 there emerge some secondary constraints , @xmath107 but no velocities are determined .",
    "the poisson parentheses between all the secondary constraints weakly vanish , as they are all proportional to secondary constraints .",
    "the explicit expressions are @xmath108 all other poisson brackets trivially vanish .",
    "as no new constraints arise and no more velocities are determined , the conclusion is that all of the constraints of the kk theory are first class .",
    "this result is consistent with the fact that the kk excited modes @xmath3 are gauge fields because they are the only ones that generate constraints .",
    "the derivation of the constraints of the kk theory that we discussed through this subsection was carried out at the four  dimensional level . another way to find these results",
    "is achieved  @xcite by considering the well known constraints of the four  dimensional yang ",

    "after compactification , one can perform the necessary kk expansions of the five  dimensional constraints , then utilize fourier analysis , and finally find  @xcite the same expressions that we just showed .    according to dirac , the first",
    " class constraints of a given gauge theory are the generators of gauge transformations . as we have already calculated the first",
    " class constraints of the kk theory , we can find the gauge transformations by defining the castellani s gauge generator  @xcite as @xmath109,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the gauge parameters @xmath1 and @xmath110 are only restricted to be soft .",
    "we then calculate the poisson brackets of this generator with all the dynamic variables of the theory as @xmath111 which consistently coincide with eqs .",
    "( [ zmgt ] ) , ( [ emgt ] ) and ( [ pgbgt ] ) . as before , taking @xmath112 ( @xmath87 ) leads to the sgt ( nsgt ) .      at this point ,",
    "one detail about gauge symmetry of the kk theory still remains pending .",
    "some lines above , we discussed the kk expansion of five  dimensional covariant objects , which in this case were the kk curvatures @xmath15 .",
    "this procedure produced a set of kk excitations of the curvatures , which we denoted by @xmath71 , @xmath73 and @xmath75 .",
    "what we are going to discuss in this subsection is that such kk excited modes are  @xcite covariant objects under the two sets of four  dimensional gauge transformations , that is , under the sgt and the nsgt .",
    "this issue is very important , as it permits one to elegantly prove that the kk theory is gauge invariant under any of these kk gauge variations .",
    "the gauge covariance of the kk excitations of the curvature is indeed encripted in the five  dimensional curvatures , which transform under the @xmath7 gauge group as @xmath113 now , we insert the kk expansions of the curvatures and the gauge parameters into these expressions , and then we carry out a fourier analysis as we did to obtain the kk curvatures in terms of the kk modes of the fields .",
    "this straightforwardly produces the following transformation laws : @xmath114 by taking vanishing kk excited modes of the gauge parameters , that is , @xmath112 , one can determine the way in which the kk excitations of the curvatures transform under the sgt . on the other hand , by imposing @xmath87 one obtains the nsgt laws of these kk curvatures . in both cases , the kk curvatures transform as covariant objects .",
    "the lesson to learn is that _ kk expanding covariant objects in extra ",
    "dimensional gauge theories produces four  dimensional covariant objects_. the form of the gauge transformations of the kk curvatures allows one to prove in a rather simple way that the kk theory is gauge invariant : @xmath115 .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the four  dimensional kk lagrangian @xmath31 is invariant , separately , under each set of gauge transformations .",
    "this remarkable result is sublty related to the fact that the sgt are independent of the nsgt because they are defined by different sets of kk gauge parameters .",
    "the last assertion has another profound implication that affects quantization , which we will discuss in the next section .",
    "one of the main features of models involving ued is that they do not produce  @xcite tree ",
    "level corrections to low  energy observables . the absence of such tree ",
    "level contributions is a consequence of the so  called kk number conservation  @xcite , which occurs exclusively in ued contexts .",
    "if one assumes that there is no additional interaction that alters the momentum along the extra dimensions , the momentum , which is quantized by compactification of such directions , is stationary . at the level of the kk theory ,",
    "this leads to a conservation of the kk number , which results in the absence of couplings involving only one kk excited mode and implies that the very first contributions to low ",
    "energy physics from the extra dimensions enter for the first time at the one  loop level . in this context ,",
    "loop calculations containing ued effects play a prominent role .",
    "this occurs , for instance , in the case of gluon fusion @xmath116 , which is generated for the first time at the one  loop level , so that it could receive  @xcite important contributions from extra  dimensional physics .",
    "the fact that the very first corrections to low ",
    "energy observables enter since the one  loop level in ued models also comes along with a relatively small lower bound on the compactification scale , which is estimated to be  @xcite @xmath117 .",
    "a lower bound as small as this could enhance extra",
    " dimensional effects so that the international linear collider be sensitive to them , as it was shown in ref .",
    ". such importance of radiative corrections , in this framework , renders the quantization of the kk excited modes a necessary requirement to perform calculations . as we discussed in the last section , the kk lagrangian that emerged from the five  dimensional yang ",
    "mills theory is separately invariant under the sgt and the nsgt , which in turn are defined , respectively , by the zero modes and the excited modes of the gauge parameters .",
    "this means that these two sorts of gauge invariance are independent of each other , which is sublty related to the fact that the quantization of the kk theory can be divided  @xcite into two independent parts : the quantization of the kk zero modes ; and the quantization of the kk excited modes .",
    "so one can quantize , for instance , the kk excited modes while leaving the kk zero modes as classical fields .",
    "we will take this route , as the calculation of extra  dimensional loop corrections of low  energy green s functions only requires the quantization of the kk excited modes . of course , once the kk excitations are quantized , one can do it with the zero modes . in",
    "what follows , we will discuss some general issues relative to the quantization of gauge systems within the brst approach . at the same time",
    ", we will apply the main results to the kk theory .      in general ,",
    "the covariant quantization of gauge systems is achieved within the brst formulation .",
    "the brst symmetry emerges , classically , in the context of the batalin ",
    "vilkovisky formalism  @xcite , which is also known as the field ",
    "antifield formalism  @xcite .",
    "consider a gauge system described by an action @xmath118 $ ] , which is a functional of fields @xmath119 .",
    "for simplicity , assume that the theory of interest is irreducible , so that there are no gauge transformations for gauge transformations .",
    "ghost fields are commonly introduced in the quantization of gauge systems , as they are used to compensate for the effects of the gauge degrees of freedom  @xcite in order to preserve unitarity .",
    "if the theory has @xmath120 gauge invariances , the formalism demands the inclusion , since the classical level , of @xmath120 ghost fields , @xmath121 , that is , one ghost field per each gauge invariance of the theory .",
    "indeed , such ghost fields coincide with the gauge parameters defining the gauge transformations , although their statistics is opposite to that of such parameters . in particular",
    ", the kk theory must comprise an infinite number of ghost fields , which is the number of gauge parameters defining gauge transformations .",
    "when gf and path integral quantization are considered , the minimal set , constituted by the fields @xmath119 and the ghost fields @xmath122 , must be extended to a nonminimal set by introducing an antighost , @xmath123 , and an auxiliary field , @xmath124 , for each ghost .",
    "each couple @xmath125 receives the name of _ trivial pair_. we generically denote the fields constituting the non  minimal set by @xmath126 : @xmath127 each of these fields is provided with an additive conserved charge , known as the _ ghost number_. the ghost number is @xmath69 for matter , gauge and auxiliary fields , @xmath128 for ghosts and @xmath129 for antighosts .",
    "the number of dynamic variables of the theory is then further increased by introducing an antifield , @xmath130 , per each field @xmath126 .",
    "the statistics of a given antifield @xmath130 is opposite to that of its corresponding field @xmath126 , and their ghost numbers are related by @xmath131 .",
    "the system so enlarged is described by an _ extended action _ , @xmath132 $ ] , which is a bosonic functional of the fields and antifields that has ghost number @xmath69 .",
    "the next step consists in endowing the configuration space with a symplectic structure that is known as the antibracket , which is defined in terms of left and right differentiations as @xmath133 where @xmath134 and @xmath135 are two functionals .",
    "the antifield @xmath130 is canonically conjugate to the field @xmath126 , which means that they obey the fundamental antibrackets @xmath136 the extended action @xmath137 satisfies the master equation , @xmath138 and is the generator of brst transformations , @xmath139 where @xmath140 is a functional of fields and antifields . by virtue of the form of the brst transformations , eq.([brstt ] ) , and the master equation , notice that the extended action @xmath137 is brst invariant , that is , @xmath141 . in general",
    ", a solution to the master equation has its own set of gauge invariances .",
    "when the number of such invariances equals the number of antifields , the solution receives the name of _ proper solution_. an acceptable solution to the master equation must meet two indispensable requisites : ( 1 ) it must be a proper solution ; and ( 2 ) it must make contact with the original action @xmath142 by satisfying the boundary condition @xmath143\\right|_{\\phi^*=0}=s_0[\\phi].\\ ] ] the proper solution to the master equation can be expanded in the antifields as @xmath144=s_0[\\phi]+(\\delta_{\\rm b}\\phi^a)\\phi^*_a+\\cdots,\\ ] ] in which all the gauge  structure tensors characterizing the gauge system appear . in this sense",
    ", the proper solution @xmath137 is the generating functional of the gauge - structure tensors .",
    "the proper solution also generates the gauge algebra through the master equation . for this reason ,",
    "the complete determination of a classical gauge system is achieved when the proper solution is established and the master equation is calculated , as these two steps generate the gauge structure tensors and the gauge algebra that they must satisfy .",
    "the gauge variations @xmath145 are not known beforehand , but one can propose the most general proper solution to the master equation with gauge  structure tensors and then use it to obtain the variations .    strictly speaking , the whole procedure discussed above should be followed to solve the classical kk system within the brst framework .",
    "nevertheless , there is a quite simpler path  @xcite that leads to the desired result .",
    "the idea is that the solution to the four  dimensional yang  mills theory is a known result that can be directly generalized to the five  dimensional case .",
    "after compactification , the corresponding five  dimensional proper solution can be manipulated through fourier analysis to obtain the four  dimensional kk proper solution . the five  dimensional version of the proper solution to the master equation corresponding to the yang ",
    "mills theory is @xmath146 which clearly sataisfies the boundary condition @xmath147 , that is , by eliminating the antifields @xmath130 we recover the ordinary five  dimensional yang  mills action , defined by the @xmath45 lagrangian . the compactification of the extra dimension grants parity and periodicity properties to the dynamic variables and covariant objects , so that they can be expanded in kk towers . in the case of the first term of the proper solution , eq.([5dymproper ] ) ,",
    "fourier analysis leads to the kk theory described by the @xmath31 lagrangian . concerning the other terms ,",
    "each antifield is assumed to have the same parity behavior than its corresponding field . in the case of the ghost fields , as they coincide with the gauge parameters , they have even parity under reflection of the extra  dimensional coordinate .",
    "of course , the antifields of the ghost fields are assumed to be even , for their zero  modes are necessary to recover the proper solution to the ordinary four  dimensional yang  mills theory .",
    "this also serves as an argument to assume that the auxiliary fields @xmath148 are even . by kk  expanding covariant objects and integrating out the extra dimension , the following kk extended action is derived : @xmath149.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that this expression satisfies the proper  solution boundary condition . on the other hand , observe that the elimination of all terms involving kk excited modes leads to the proper solution of the four  dimensional yang ",
    "mills theory .",
    "finally , it is worth remarking that the calculation of the variations @xmath150 allows one to consistently recover  @xcite the sgt , eqs.([sgt1 ] ) , ( [ sgt2 ] ) , ( [ sgt3 ] ) , and the nsgt , eqs.([nsgt1 ] ) , ( [ nsgt2 ] ) , ( [ nsgt3 ] ) . as the proper solution exhibited in eq.([kkexts ] ) classically solves the kk theory , the next step is quantization , which we perform in the next subsection .      in general ,",
    "the quantization of a given gauge system calls for the fixation of the gauge .",
    "gauge systems are enriched by the deep concept of gauge symmetry , whose origin is an overdescription  @xcite in the sense that the number of degrees of freedom introduced to fully describe a given physical system surpasses the minimal number of degrees of freedom that is necessary to achieve the picture .",
    "different gauges represent different mathematical configurations of the physical description that are related by gauge transformations .",
    "as the theory is invariant under such transformations , there is freedom to elect one particular gauge and perform reliable calculations . at the end of the day",
    ", physically acceptable results must not depend on the choice of the gauge .",
    "the fixation of the gauge is very important for quantization , as leaving the degeneration associated to gauge symmetry renders the path integral divergent , so that it can not be properly quantized .",
    "the brst quantization incorporates the fixation of the gauge in a rather elegant manner , which we briefly describe below .",
    "consider the following two facts : ( 1 ) the extended action , eq.([kkexts ] ) , possesses gauge symmetry , and hence can not be directly quantized ; ( 2 ) the antifields in such extended action do not represent physical degrees of freedom , so that they must be removed . instead of just setting the antifields equal to zero , which would get the calculation back to the beginning , one can kill two birds with one stone by fixing the gauge through a device that , at the same time , removes the antifields . in general ,",
    "the elimination of the antifields can be achieved by defining a gf fermion , @xmath151 , satisfying @xmath152 this fermion is a functional that depends on the fields and has ghost number @xmath129 .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the requirement of properness of the solution to the master equation is vital for this gf procedure , as it ensures that such solution has the exact number of antifields to appropriately remove all the gauge degeneracy .",
    "on the other hand , notice that the presence of the trivial pairs is necessary because the only fields with ghost number @xmath129 are the antighosts .",
    "recall that the kk theory has two sorts of gauge symmetries , which are independent of each other .",
    "we wish to quantize only the kk excited modes , so that fixing the gauge with respect to the nsgt is enough .",
    "to do so , we introduce the fermionic functional @xmath153 , which will allow us to remove the antifields of the kk excited modes via the relation @xmath154 the explicit form of @xmath153 is @xmath155 wiht @xmath37 being the gf parameter and @xmath156 representing bosonic gf functions , which we will conveniently define below . using this expression and eq.([ff ] )",
    "yields the relations @xmath157 which we employ to eliminate the antifields in the extended action @xmath137 .",
    "the resulting expression is known as the gauge  fixed action , which we denote by @xmath158 .",
    "it si explicitly given by @xmath159.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is worth empasizing that the gauge  fixed action @xmath160 is not anymore invariant under the nsgt , although one can define suitable gf functions @xmath156 that do not involve terms explicitly breaking invariance with repect to the sgt and , in this manner , maintain the symmetric behavior with respect to such transformations .",
    "the preservation of the sgt gauge symmetry will introduce important simplifications for subsequent calculations that we will perform in the next chapter .",
    "for such reason , we provide , below , a set of gf functions that will fulfill this requisite .",
    "note that the auxiliary fields @xmath161 are still present in the gauge  fixed action , but they do not propagate . as they appear quadratically , we could integrate them out in order to remove them .",
    "however , such an integration is equivalent to directly using the equations of motion , @xmath162 which we employ to eliminate these fields and obtain a quantum lagrangian of the form @xmath163 where the gf term , defined by the functions @xmath156 , is given by @xmath164 while the fpg part has been split into two parts as @xmath165 the second fpg part contains all the four - ghost fields terms , and is not important for the present work , so that we will forget about it from here on . on the other hand , notice that the gf term is not the only one that involves the gf functions , as they also permeate the @xmath166 term . as we wish invariance of the theory under the sgt to be preserved , we introduce the following gf functions , @xmath167 which transform covariantly under the sgt .",
    "this set of gf functions is indeed inspired by a proposal originaly given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a similar gf procedure was employed in the context of the 331 model  @xcite . by introducing these gf functions into the different terms of the @xmath168 lagrangian , eq.([lkk ] ) , we obtain the following expressions for the gf and fpg parts : @xmath169,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath170 is the mass of the @xmath171th kk excited mode .",
    "notice also that both the pseudo  goldstone bosons @xmath89 and the ghost ( antighost ) fields @xmath172 ( @xmath173 ) have aquired unphysical masses @xmath174 , that is , gauge  dependent masses .",
    "another interesting feature of this approach for the fixation of the gauge is that it leads to the elimination of some vertices involving pseudo ",
    "goldstone bosons , which is convenient from the practical viewpoint , as loop calculations become easier .",
    "such eliminations occur in the case of the unphysical bilinear and trilinear couplings @xmath175 and @xmath176 that are generated by the term @xmath177 .",
    "such couplings are cancelled by summing them with the gf part : @xmath178+\\cdots= m_m\\partial_\\mu(a^{(m)a}_5a^{(m)b\\mu})+\\cdots\\ ] ]      extra ",
    "dimensional theories involve coupling constants with inverse  mass dimensions , which means that they are nonrenormalizable .",
    "this happens , for instance , with the five  dimensional yang ",
    "mills theory , but notice that the kk theory that we derived by compactifying and integrating out the extra dimension is composed exclusively by terms whose canonical dimension is less or equal than four .",
    "if we had known the kk lagrangian @xmath31 without a prior knowledge of its extra  dimensional origin , at the first glance we could have navely said , on the grounds of the dyson s renormalizability criterion , that such theory is renormalizable .",
    "but then what happened with the nonrenormalizable nature of the five  dimensional yang ",
    "mills theory ?",
    "the answer lies in one of the main consequences of compactification : the kk infinite sums .",
    "it is through the kk sums that the nonrenormalizability of the five  dimensional theory manifests , for , in general , such sums diverge .",
    "one way to get rid of such divergencies consists in truncating  @xcite the kk towers .",
    "this idea can be physically supported by thinking that the nonrenormalizable behavior of extra ",
    "dimensional theories indicates that a more fundamental description enters at an energy scale beyond the compactification scale , but not too far from it , which in turn implies that one can take into account only a finite number of terms of the series .",
    "the five  dimensional version of the sm is an interesting particular case , for each one  loop contribution to low ",
    "energy physics involves only one  @xcite kk infinite sum , which produces riemman@xmath179 functions .",
    "such series are convergent , so that the one  loop corrections to light green s functions are  @xcite renormalizable .",
    "the possibility of renormalizing such contributions is important because they incarnate the lowest  order effects of the extra dimension on light physics , which means that some of the largest corrections to low ",
    "energy physics can be calculated without amiguities .",
    "it is worth appreciating the great relevance of this result . in this section ,",
    "we provide a proof  @xcite of the renormalizability of the one  loop effects of the extra dimension on light green s functions .",
    "we will show that the divergencies emerged from the extra  dimensional effects can be absorbed by the parameters of the low  energy theory .    as a first step , we quantize the ordinary four  dimensional yang  mills theory , for which we must fix the gauge with respect to the zero  mode gauge fields @xmath2 .",
    "the proof of one  loop renormalizability of the standard yang ",
    "mills theory is more simply achieved by using the background field method  @xcite ( bfm ) , which ensures preservation of gauge invariance with respect to the sgt . within such framework",
    ", we divide the zero  mode gauge fields @xmath2 into two parts , @xmath180 where the @xmath2 in the right  hand side is a classical background field and @xmath181 is a fluctuating quantum field . in this context , the classical background field @xmath2 is assumed to be a classical field configuration , while @xmath181 is a functional integration variable . by using this splitting ,",
    "the curvature is replaced by @xmath182 now consider the gf condition @xmath183 which is sgt  covariant .",
    "the gauge  fixed lagrangian for the standard yang  mills theory is then given by @xmath184 this lagrangian is invariant under the sgt , with the ghost and fluctuating quantum fields transforming in the adjount representation of the @xmath4 gauge group .",
    "the quantization of the low  energy theory , performed through the above lines , has completed the quantization of the whole kk theory . from the complete kk quantum lagrangian",
    ", we extract those parts that contribute at the one  loop level to light green s functions , and find that the corresponding terms are @xmath185 with @xmath186 it is worth remarking that the @xmath187 and @xmath188 are quite similar .",
    "notice also that the couplings of the @xmath188 lagrangian are all of renormalizable type and that they are all the ones allowed by gauge invariance .",
    "this in turn implies that the divergences generated the kk modes @xmath3 must have the same structure of those produced by the zero  mode quantum fluctuations @xmath181 .",
    "it occurs that the gauge invariance left by the background field gauge ensures that the ultra  violet divergencies ( uvd ) associated with the standard yang ",
    "mills theory have the form @xmath189 where dimensional analysis indicates that @xmath190 is logarithmically divergent .",
    "as just commented , this is the structure of the divergencies that the kk excited modes are expected to produce , so that the total one  loop kk divergencies , which include those associated to both the zero and the excited modes , are expressed as @xmath191 with @xmath192 .",
    "the divergencies generated by the kk excited modes can be then absorbed by the parameters of the low  energy theory by defining the renormalized zero  mode fields , @xmath193 , and coupling constant , @xmath194 , as @xmath195 which produce the renormalized curvature @xmath196 two main ingredients of this proof of renormalization are the gauge invariance left by the background field gauge and the covariant gf procedure introduced for the kk excited modes .",
    "it is a well  known fact , from radiative corrections , that logarithmically divergent integrals can introduce effects that are proportional to the logarithm of the mass of the particle circulating in the loop . in the case of this kk theory , such logarithmic divergence should have the form @xmath197 , where @xmath198 is a mass scale like the one inroduced by dimensional regularization and @xmath171 is a kk mode number .",
    "the nondecoupling behavior of the terms involving such logarithmic divergence are irrelevant as they are unobservable , for they can be absorbed by renormalization . in the next chapter",
    "we will prove renormalizability of the kk one  loop contributions by integrating out  @xcite the kk excited modes .",
    "the integration of the kk excited modes originated in the five  dimensional version of the yang  mills theory and the posterior derivation of an effective lagrangian including",
    "the first kk excited  modes one  loop effects has alluring features that deserve some comments . as we discussed above",
    ", the kk excited modes are gauge fields , so that the quantization of them required a gf procedure , which inserted a gf parameter , @xmath37 , into the theory . the possibility that extra ",
    "dimensional physics produces an effective lagrangian expansion that depends on the gf procedure comes into the game .",
    "this interesting issue had never been discussed in the literature , as the integration of heavy gauge fields to obtain an effective lagrangian is a novel calculation . from the phenomenological viewpoint ,",
    "the integration of kk modes is attractive because , as we have already discussed , the contributions of this sort of heavy physics on light green s functions appear for the first time at the one  loop level .",
    "the effective lagrangian resulting from the integration of the kk excited modes shall comprehend such one  loop effects , so that from this expansion one can obtain corrections to low ",
    "energy physics from tree ",
    "level diagrams . as we proved above , the one  loop effects from extra ",
    "dimensional physics produced by this model are renormalizable .",
    "this result can be also achieved by integrating out the kk excited modes , as we shall show below .",
    "the nonrenormalizable behavior of extra - dimensional models is physically important , as it means that there is doubtless a more fundamental theory , perhaps string theory , whose effects shall manifest at a higher energy scale , @xmath21 .",
    "the significance of this more fundamental description can be in principle parametrized through a five  dimensional effective lagrangian constituted by the five  dimensional yang  mills theory and a sum of terms involving operators of canonical dimension higher than five .",
    "as the theory is nonrenormalizable , there is no criterion that restricts the number of such operators that one can include .",
    "the general form of the effective lagrangian obtained by integrating out the kk excited modes allows one to perform  @xcite in a rather simple way a comparison of the extra  dimensional effects , characterized by the compactification scale @xmath23 , with those from the fundamental description of nature that lies beyond the compactification scale , and whose distinctive energy scale is @xmath21 .",
    "the integration of heavy kk modes is not , in general , an easy task , for even the simplest cases represent technical challenges .",
    "this is the case , for instance , of the euler  heisenberg lagrangian  @xcite , which is obtained by assuming that the electron field of the lagrangian describing quantum electrodynamics is heavy , which allows one to integrate it  @xcite out .",
    "the sole replacement  @xcite of the abelian theory by the yang ",
    "mills theory introduces significative difficulties , rendering the calculation of the low  energy effective lagrangian rather intricate .",
    "instead of performing such a baroque calculation , as one should do by following the ordinary path , people has developed  @xcite methods to systematically obtain effective lagrangians in simplier ways .",
    "in particular , there is one method propounded  @xcite by m. bilenki and a. santamaria some years ago . in that time",
    ", these authors considered an economic sm extension that incorporated a heavy scalar singlet coupled to the leptonic doublet .",
    "they supposed that the scalar was heavy , then integrated it out , and finally calculated an effective lagrangian . in the present paper , we adjust their elegant method to the case of heavy gauge fields and obtain the low  energy effective description containting up to canonical  dimension  six nonrenormalizable operators built of light yang ",
    "mills covariant objects and being governed by the sgt , which represent the low  energy symmetry .",
    "as we will show , the proof will be very profitable in the sense that some interesting results will emerge along the process .",
    "it is worth commenting that the integration of heavy kk modes and the consequent obtainment of an effective lagrangian expansion is an issue rarely considered in the literature  @xcite , but it is however interesting because it provides a way to calculate the lowest  order extra ",
    "dimensional effects on light physics by dealing just with tree ",
    "level vertices instead of performing one  loop calculations .",
    "this issue enlarges the value of this work .    in the last chapter ,",
    "we quantized the low  energy theory by means of the bfm . in what follows",
    "we will disregard such result and look only to the gauge  fixed lagrangian @xmath168 , eq.([lkk ] ) , where the only fields that have been subjected to quantization are the kk excited modes . by virtue of the goals pursued in this paper ,",

    "it comprises all one  loop effects of extra  dimensional physics on the light green s functions , and hence on low  energy observables .",
    "as we discussed before , the one  loop corrections of extra  dimensional physics manifests for the first time at the one  loop level , so that the @xmath203 part contains all the first contributions of this ued model to low  energy physics .",
    "this term is particulartly relevant for the present work because it is the one from which the kk excited modes shall be integrated out to obtain the low  energy effective lagrangian expansion .",

    "they are nonfundamental descriptions of nature that have a limited range of validity , so that as one approaches the characteristic cutoff of a given effective lagrangian , the expansion becomes senseless and the full fundamental theory responsible of its effects enters as the genuine high  energy description of nature .",
    "for instance , the effective lagrangian just derived in this section can be reliably used within a range of energies low enough below the compactification scale @xmath23 .",
    "one of the main features of the effective lagrangian description is that these theories are built of low  energy dynamic variables and continuous symmetries , athough violations of discrete symmetries can appear .",
    "they can be used in two ways , depending on whether the fundamental theory is or is not known from the onset . if one departs with the precise knowledge of the high  energy theory , on can integrate out the heavy dynamic variables and calculate an effective lagrangian involving nonrenormalizable terms of canonical dimensions higher than four , which will be accompanied by coefficients whose precise form shall be precisely known .",
    "this was the path followed in this thesis work .",

    "one can then calculate contributions of the nonrenormalizable operators to light observables and use experimental data to set bounds on the high energy physics that is the presumable origin of the effective lagrangian .",

    "a new sort of complicated gauge transformations , which we called the nonstandard gauge transformations , emerges . according to the structure of both of these sets of gauge transformations ,",
    "the kk zero modes @xmath2 are gauge fields under the sgt , the kk excited modes @xmath3 are gauge fields under the nsgt , and the scalar fields @xmath89 are pseudo",
    " goldstone bosons that can be removed from the theory by choosing a particular gauge with respect to the nsgt .",
    "the quantization of the kk theory was another main issue of this thesis work , and it is worth emhasizing that it had not been consistently discussed before in the literature .",
    "the quantization was performed on the grounds of the brst formulation .",
    "an interesting feature of the kk theory that we derived is that the existence of two independent sets of gauge transformations , defined by independent gauge parameters , opens the possibility of quantizing the zero modes and the excited ones independently of each other .",
    "we utilized this fact to quantize the kk excitations and then we could quantize the low  energy theory and prove that the one  loop level contributions of the kk excited modes to low ",
    "energy physics are renormalizable , which is very important , as it ensures that the very first contributions of the extra  dimensional physics to light observables can be calculated without worrying about ambiguities introduced by an infinite number of parameters absorbing divergencies .",
    "as the two quantization steps were independent of each other , we were able to use different schemes to quantize the zero and the excited modes .",
    "we paid especial attention to the quantization of the kk excited modes , for which we introduced a profitable gf procedure that allowed us to preserve gauge invariance under the sgt and also introduced significative simplifications for further developments of the paper .",
    "this gf procedure is based on a proposal made in the literature for the 331 model , which we found to have some similarities with the kk theory that we analyzed through this thesis work .",
    "the quantization of the kk excited modes of the kk theory produced the quantum version of the lagrangian , which comprises the kk theory , the gf term , and the most general fpg sector .",
    "the knowledge of the precise form of the kk quantum lagrangian allowed us to integrate out the kk excited modes , which we did by adjusting a method proposed some years ago by m. bilenky and a. santamaria .",
    "such an integration comprehended the kk excited gauge fields , the pseudo ",
    "goldstone bosons and the kk excited modes of the ghost fields .",
    "this integration is novel , as the integration of heavy gauge fields to obtain an effective lagrangian is a rahter ignored issue .",
    "moreover , it brings interesting possibilities , as the gauge  dependent behavior of the gauge modes perseveres to the point that the resulting effective lagrangian expansion is gauge dependent .",
    "this feature is indeed consistent , for the effective lagrangian so obtained is equivalent to a sum of one  loop light green s functions with light external legs , but kk excited modes exclusively filling the loops . during the development of the calculation",
    ", we were able to elegantly and explicitly show that , under the sgt  covariant gf procedure that we introduced for the kk excitations , the contributions of the pseudo ",
    "goldstone bosons are minus twice the ones generated by the ghost fields .",
    "we were also able to confirm , through the derivation of the effective lagrangian , that the contributions of the kk excited modes at the one  loop level are renormalizable , as the divergencies generated by the kk excited modes are absorbed by the parameters of the low  energy theory .",
    "our expression of the gauge  dependent effective lagrangian involves four  dimensional nonrenormalizable operators of mass dimensions six , which are governed by the light symmetries , lorentz and @xmath4 , and whose dynamic variables are only kk zero modes .",
    "finally , the effective lagrangian that we derived allowed us to perform in a simple way a comparison among the impact , at low  energy , of the extra  dimensional effects and the ones produced by the fundamental theory , lying beyond extra dimensions .",
    "we found , within the feynmant hooft gauge , that the effects of the extra  dimensional physics are dominant , for the contributions from the fundamental description represent around @xmath278 of their impact .",
    "this behavior is provided by an extra supression introduced by the fundamental scale , @xmath21 .",
    "the functional integration of heavy fields in a theory describing physics at certain high energy scale leads to determinants that concern all of the light degrees of freedom , both internal and external .",
    "the determinants so obtained can be transformed into traces over all of such degrees of freedom . in this appendix",
    ", we adjust the method presented in ref .",
    "@xcite to calculate a trace carrying the contributions of heavy gauge bosons and obtain a low  energy expansion up to canonical  dimension  six non  renormalizable operators .",
    "consider the general trace @xmath279\\equiv\\int d^4x\\hspace{0.05cm}{\\cal l}_{\\rm 1-loop}(x ) \\label{trdef}\\ ] ] where @xmath280 is the covariant derivative for the @xmath281 gauge group and @xmath232 is a space  time dependent matrix that we suppose to be arbitrary .",

    "it also affects the internal degrees of freedom , which in this case are determined by the gauge and lorentz groups . in the following , the symbol  tr",

    "as divergencies shall appear , below , they must be appropriately regularized .",
    "we follow the dimensional regularization approach , for which we work , from here on , in @xmath226 dimensions .",
    "note that the argument of the trace is non  local , so that , up to this point , performing this operation makes no sense . to obtain a local expression",
    ", one can first perform the trace over the space  time coordinates , which , for a general operator @xmath285 , should be understood as @xmath286 where a completeness relation has been inserted and we have defined @xmath287 so that @xmath198 is a factor introduced to appropriately correct dimensions . for a general quantum state ,",
    "@xmath288 , @xmath289 with @xmath290 standing for the operator @xmath285 in the representation of positions . with this in mind , note that @xmath291 by defining @xmath292 and then applying the general result shown in eq.([tredf ] ) , along with the operator identity @xmath293 , to the gauge trace , eq.([trdef ] ) , one obtains @xmath294&=&i\\hspace{0.05cm}{\\rm tr}\\hspace{0.05cm}{\\rm log}\\left [ g_{\\mu\\nu}\\left ( -\\pi^2+m^2 \\right)+u_{\\mu\\nu } \\right ] \\\\",

    "the first term of the argument of the trace in the second line of the last expression contains no fields , and hence contributes only to the vacuum energy density .",
    "thus , we drop it in what follows and conserve only the second term , so that the gauge trace is expanded as @xmath295=i\\int d^dx\\hspace{0.05cm}d^d\\tilde{p}\\hspace{0.1cm}{\\rm tr}\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k}\\frac{\\left [ ( \\pi^2 + 2\\pi\\cdot p)\\delta^\\mu\\hspace{0.001cm}_\\nu - u^\\mu\\hspace{0.001cm}_\\nu \\right]^k}{\\left [ p^2-m^2 \\right]^k}\\hspace{0.05cm}{\\bf 1}. \\label{trexpansion}\\ ] ] the argument of the gauge trace , written in this form , is local , so that the trace over the internal degrees of freedom can be taken in each term of the series .    from the local form of eq.([trexpansion ] ) , one can appreciate that the calculation of the momentum integrals shall provide an expansion of non  renormalizable operators , each one multiplied by a power of @xmath296 .",
    "in other words , by comparing eqs.([trdef ] ) and ( [ trexpansion ] ) , one can extract the lagrangian @xmath297^k}{\\left [ p^2-m^2 \\right]^k } { \\bf 1 } \\right\\ } , \\label{appl1loopexp}\\ ] ] then solve the loop integrals term by term in the series , and finally write @xmath298 as @xmath299 with @xmath300 representing a linear combination of traces of gauge invariant operators of canonical dimension @xmath301 , built of the gauge fields @xmath220 , the matrix @xmath302 , and the @xmath281 covariant derivative . in the @xmath298 expansion shown in eq.([lexpgenform ] ) , there is a global factor , @xmath226 , which is expected because the gauge trace , eq.([trdef ] ) , was produced by the integration of vector fields , which are constituted by @xmath226 scalar fields , and the sum of all contributions produces this global factor .",
    "a convenient normalization of this expansion fixes the @xmath303 coefficients as @xmath304 as already commented , the @xmath300 are combinations of traces of dimension2@xmath305 operators , so that , in general , they should have the form @xmath306 for the first values of @xmath305 ( @xmath307 ) , we shall employ the following sets as bases : @xmath308 the method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite relies on the fact that eqs.([appl1loopexp ] ) , ( [ lexpgenform ] ) and ( [ tracescombination ] ) are valid for any field configuration .",
    "in fact , the @xmath309 coefficients are just numbers , independent of the field configuration , so that if one is able to determine them within a specific choice , the coefficients corresponding to the bases exhibited in eqs.([bk1 ] ) , ( [ bk2 ] ) and ( [ bk3 ] ) can be obtained .",
    "an appropriate election is the field configuration such that @xmath310 which imply that @xmath311,&\\hspace{0.1cm}d_\\mu{\\cal m}=[e_\\mu,{\\cal m } ] , \\label{scconditions2 } \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath312 represents any matrix valued function of @xmath313 and @xmath314 . in these very particular circumstances , the numerator of the @xmath298 expansion , eq.([appl1loopexp ] ) , is greatly simplified , for each term of the series can be expressed as @xmath315^k{\\bf 1}=\\delta^\\mu\\hspace{0.001cm}_\\nu(2ie\\cdot p)^k,\\ ] ] which considerably reduces the procedure of calculating the momentum integrals : @xmath316 in passing from the first to the second line in eq.([steps ] ) , we took the trace over the lorentz indices , which gave rise to the @xmath226 factor ( recall that we are working in @xmath226 dimensions ! ) .",

    "<S> we obtain a kaluza  klein ( kk ) theory by expanding in kk towers covariant objects rather than fields , as such an approach yields a four  dimensional description possessing an interesting gauge structure in which two sorts of gauge transformations leave , independently of each other , the theory invariant . </S>",
    "<S> one type of such transformations are the standard gauge transformations ( sgt ) , which are defined by the zero modes of the gauge parameters , @xmath1 , and under which the kk zero modes , @xmath2 , behave as gauge fields . </S>",
    "<S> the other transformations receive the name of nonstandard gauge transformations ( nsgt ) , and under them the kk excited modes , @xmath3 , are gauge fields . </S>",
    "<S> we then quantize the kk excited modes within the becchi  </S>",

    "<S>  tyutin ( brst ) approach , which includes the elimination of the gauge symmetries associated to the kk excitations through a gauge  fixing ( gf ) procedure that preserves gauge invariance with respect to the sgt . </S>",
    "<S> we also present the most general faddeev  </S>",
    "<S> popov ghost ( fpg ) sector , which emerges from the brst quantization process . as a next step , we integrate out the kk excited modes and derive an effective lagrangian containing the explicit expressions of the coefficients multiplying all the independent nonrenormalizable operators of canonical dimension six that are allowed by the @xmath4 gauge group and by lorentz invariance . </S>",
    "<S> we first perform the calculation in the feynmant hooft ( fth ) gauge and then in the general @xmath5 gauge . </S>",
    "<S> we find for the latter case a gauge  dependent result . by taking the fth gauge in such gauge  dependent expression </S>",
    "<S> , we consistently recover the result obtained by considering the fth gauge from the beginning . </S>",
    "<S> the derivation of the effective lagrangian explicitly proves that the contributions of kk excited modes to one  loop light green s functions are renormalizable . finally , we compare , at the four  dimensional level , the effects of the extra dimension with the contributions of a presumed fundamental theory describing nature at energies higher than those corresponding to the extra  dimensional physics . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the effects of the kk excited modes are the dominant ones . </S>"
