    "we have to assume a spectral shape and slope . assuming a time decay law @xmath70 with @xmath711.2 ( heise et al . in preparation ) , we obtain that the total fluence in the afterglow between 2 and 10 kev uncorrected for redshift is 4.1 @xmath72 erg 2",

    "this is 2 times the total luminosity in the same energy band during the burst .",

    "we obtain a fluence in the afterglow @xmath74 . using a more conservative assumption , adding an exponential cutoff with folding energy @xmath250 kev , the total fluence in the afterglow up to 2.5 days after the main event is 1.15@xmath75 .",

    "this is comparable to the total radiated power in the main grb event .",
    "this estimate is only speculative , as the spectral data of the afterglow are consistent with any cutoff energy above @xmath22 kev ( 90% confidence ) but it points out the need for prompt measurements of the afterglow that can give a good estimate of the spectral shape above 10 kev . +",
    "unfortunately the spectral evolution in hard x - rays ( above 10 kev ) of most grbs seems unaccessible to the present generation of telescopes operating in this energy band .",
    "this is a very important observational point that can not be fulfilled up to the next generation of focusing hard x - ray telescopes , maybe at least for a decade .",
    "the time resolved spectral analysis of the afterglow reported in table 1 , even if of low statistical quality , do suggest that the spectral shape remains stable during our observation of the afterglow . while these data can not be profitably used to constrain the spectral evolution of the afterglow in x  rays , they confirm the stability of the _ engine _ that is producing the observed x ",
    "ray emission in spite of the substantial power ",
    "law decline with time in the observed x  ray luminosity .",
    "the spectral evolution from grb to the x - ray afterglow indicates that the energy distribution shifts towards lower energies , as expected from theoretical models .",
    "the model for spectral evolution of sari et al .",
    "( @xcite ) suggests that the high energy tail of the emitted photon spectrum of the afterglow has a power law slope @xmath78 in the case of fast cooling , where p is the index of a power law distribution of the electrons .",
    "our measurement of a power law slope @xmath79 implies p@xmath80 , a value that would give a non - finite energy in the electrons . in this case",
    "the observations can be reconciled with theory assuming that a suitable cutoff , e.g. exponential , in the energy distribution of the parent electron population is present .",
    "the observation of this cutoff in the produced photon distribution is however beyond the capability of the present generation of x  ray telescopes and may be accessible to the new missions like _ xmm _ and _ chandra _ if it is substantially below 100 kev .",
    "our data support ( as suggested also by waxman @xcite ) that we observe a regime where the synchrotron cooling time is long compared to the dynamical time . in this regime @xmath81 , and for a finite power in the electrons one obtains @xmath82 , definitely compatible with our measurement .",
    "a caveat must be added to this interpretation : as the adiabatic losses become dominant in this regime , the observed _ radiated _ luminosity is produced via synchrotron losses in much an inefficient way .",
    "this brings down the efficiency of the radiative process and in parallel rises accordingly the total energy budget in the afterglow .    the slope of the nir - to - x - ray afterglow spectrum , corrected for galactic and local extinction , and its temporal evolution are in fair agreement with models of expanding fireballs .",
    "our assumption on the intrinsic extinction reasonably conforms with the proposal that grbs are connected with star formation , and therefore expected to reside in star forming regions of their host galaxies ( though not necessarily in extreme starburst galaxies , see odewahn et al .",
    "we note that the local extinction correction we adopted has the advantage , with respect to other approaches , of using a specific model curve and of making the spectrum consistent with a single radiation component over more than three decades of frequency .",
    "if the emission is isotropic the total x-@xmath0 luminosity in grb971214 , if at redshift z=3.42 , is quite higher than 10@xmath83 ergs , as already pointed out by kulkarni et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "our analysis shows that a substantial fraction , more than 60% , of the total radiated energy in 2 - 10 kev is in the afterglow .",
    "in addition a reasonable guess of a high energy exponential cutoff , with a folding energy of 50 kev , brings us to conclude that the total power in grb971214 may be grossly underestimated if based only on the prompt event .",
    "if the efficiency to convert the total energy output from the grb in the afterglow is low , e.g. @xmath210% , as usually assumed in most theoretical models of fireball expansion , our measure of a substantial energy output in 210 kev during afterglow shows that the total energy balance of a grb is grossly underestimated .",
    "furthermore , if we consider the probable presence of a high energy tail of the afterglow , a conservative estimate may bring the total energy output from grb971214 to more than 10@xmath84 erg for an isotropically emitting source .",
    "alternatively , one may more comfortably stay with a luminosity of 10@xmath85 erg assuming a more efficient mechanism to effectively extract radiative power from the expanding fireball or assuming an extreme cutoff to the high energy spectrum .",
    "a way out of this deadlock may be beaming ( yi @xcite , shaviv & dar @xcite ) .",
    "different authors have discussed the `` beaming solution '' to the grb / afterglow observational problem ( dar @xcite , rhoads @xcite , mszros & rees @xcite , drodzova & panchenko @xcite , panaitescu et al .",
    "if the emitted power is strongly beamed , and therefore not isotropically distributed , the total power in the grb may be reduced by orders of magnitude , depending on the beam open angle .",
    "of course this has some major and obvious impacts .",
    "the number of grbs ( not detected at earth ) rises by the same orders of magnitude .",
    "limb darkening ( due to the random distribution of viewing angles inside the emission cone ) , time dependent ( due to different beaming at different times after the main event ) and energy dependent ( due to the time  dependent photon energy distribution ) effects should be observable once the afterglow sample is large enough .",
    "examples of such effects are discussed in panaitescu et al .",

    "@xcite ) predict a steeper decay in the light curve , depending on the jet opening angle .",
    "this steepening compared to an isotropic fireball expansion occurs for a 10@xmath35 opening angle at approximately 6 days after the event , earlier for smaller angles .",
    "we do not detect such a steepening in the x  ray light curve up to 2.5 days after the main event . if we assume a beam open angle @xmath86 the total energy in the event is reduced accordingly , compared to the isotropic case .    an argument to assess jetlike or spherical emission",

    "( @xcite ) , using the decay slope of the high energy afterglow . as reported by other authors ( see above ) , they suggest that the power law decay for a jetlike emission is appreciably steeper . for an isotropic fireball",

    "if the effect of beaming is comparable during the prompt event and the afterglow , the conclusions we draw on the relative _ observed _ energy output apply also directly to the total energy balance in the two cases .",
    "if the effect of beaming is evolving from an extremely beamed emission during the event to a relatively hollow beaming during the part of the afterglow we observed , the relative energy balance between the two cases should scale accordingly . as a consequence ,",
    "the energy budget in the afterglow may increase substantially with respect to that in the prompt event .    in conclusion",
    "the measurement of the spectrum during the prompt event and during the afterglow strongly supports the models for synchrotron emission from grb afterglows , with an agreement both in the x - ray band and in a broader nir - to - x - rays band ( see fig .",
    "the measured spectral slope is in fair agreement with the requirements of the models of expanding fireballs , considering also the observed temporal decay .",
    "a simple argument , based on recent models on jetlike emission and on the expected temporal decay in this case , supports the observation of a spherical expanding shell or of a moderate beaming ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "if this is the case , the observed radiated power in the afterglow is substantial and should be accordingly reproduced in any model for x - ray afterglow from grbs .",
