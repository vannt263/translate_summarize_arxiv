    "<S> distorted - wave methods are used to remove the effects of one- and two - pion exchange up to order @xmath0 from the empirical @xmath1 phase shift . the one divergence that arises </S>",
    "<S> can be renormalised using an order-@xmath2 counterterm which is provided by the ( weinberg ) power counting appropriate to the effective field theory for this channel . </S>",
    "<S> the residual interaction is used to estimate the scale of the underlying physics .    </S>",
    "<S> effective field theories ( efts ) provide important tools for constructing nuclear forces within a systematic framework . </S>",
    "<S> they respect the symmetries of underlying theory , in this case quantum chromodynamics , and offer model - independent descriptions of the dynamics at low energy scales . </S>",
    "<S> they rely on the existence of clear separation of scales between the low - energy physics of interest and the underlying , high - energy ( or short - distance ) physics . </S>",
    "<S> this makes it possible to use a perturbation theory where the expansion parameters are ratios of low- to high - energy scales .    to construct such a theory one begins by writing down the most general lagrangian or hamiltonian for the relevant low - energy degrees of freedom , containing all the interaction terms allowed by the symmetries of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters of the theory are the ( initially unknown ) constants multiplying these terms . </S>",
    "<S> there are in general an infinite number of these but they can be organised in terms of a  power counting \" of low - energy scales . to any given order in this counting , only a finite number of terms are needed .    </S>",
    "<S> since weinberg first suggested that these ideas could be applied to nuclear forces @xcite , there has been considerable debate about the appropriate power counting to use . </S>",
    "<S> most of these arguments have been about channels where scattering is strong and some pieces of the potential may need to be treated nonperturbatively , namely the @xmath3 waves and the lower spin - triplet waves . in the higher partial waves , especially the spin - singlet ones , the scattering is weak and the picture is clearer . </S>",
    "<S> for these channels , weinberg s original power counting is valid . </S>",
    "<S> this is based on simple dimensional analysis , counting powers of momenta and the pion mass . </S>",
    "<S> these low - energy scales are generically denoted by @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> many applications of efts test convergence by presenting theoretical nucleon - nucleon phase shifts , calculated at leading and higher orders , alongside empirical data . at each order , short - range interactions , expanded as polynomials in energy or momenta , have to be refitted to the data . </S>",
    "<S> a powerful alternative is to use distorted - wave ( dw ) methods to remove the effects of known long - range forces from the observed phase shifts to leave residual short - range interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the sizes and energy - dependences of these can then be used to test the convergence of the eft and to estimate the scales of the underlying physics . </S>",
    "<S> such an approach was proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and applied to the peripheral spin - singlet waves . </S>",
    "<S> more recently it has been applied to spin - triplet waves @xcite and the @xmath5 channel @xcite and closely related methods have been used by other groups to study the @xmath3 waves @xcite .    in this note </S>",
    "<S> , we extend the method of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite by applying it to the @xmath1 channel . </S>",
    "<S> we first construct dws for the leading - order one - pion - exchange ( ope ) potential . </S>",
    "<S> iterating this potential to all orders is not essential in a spin - singlet wave with @xmath6 since weinberg s power counting is expected to hold . </S>",
    "<S> however doing so avoids the need to calculate terms to fourth order in perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> since only the central part of ope contributes and its @xmath7 singularity does not alter the power - law behaviour of the wave functions near the origin , this treatment does not affect the power counting for the short - range pieces of the potential .    from the @xmath8 matrix that describes scattering between these dws , we can define a residual interaction . </S>",
    "<S> this still contains effects arising from long - range potentials of orders @xmath2 and above . </S>",
    "<S> we then use the distorted - wave born approximation ( dwba ) to subtract the matrix elements of the order-@xmath2 and @xmath0 two - pion - exchange ( tpe ) potentials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this leaves a residual interaction that should represent purely short - range physics to this order .    </S>",
    "<S> one issue that arises here , but not for the channels studied in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , is that the matrix elements of tpe between the dws are divergent . </S>",
    "<S> this divergence must be removed by renormalisation so that only finite quantities are being treated in perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> weinberg s power counting provides one energy - independent counterterm , of order @xmath2 , in this channel and this is sufficient to cancel the divergence . </S>",
    "<S> this is similar to what has been found in other waves where different counting schemes apply @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> potentials as perturbations . other approaches , which treat the whole potential to all orders , can lead to different conclusions @xcite . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we start by outlining the main features of the method from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dws @xmath9 are obtained by solving the radial schrdinger equation with the ope and centrifugal potentials , @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the orbital angular momentum , @xmath12 is the nucleon mass and @xmath13 is the on - shell relative momentum in the centre - of - mass frame . we write the leading - order ope potential in the same form as used in the nijmegen analyses and take their preferred value for the @xmath14 coupling , @xmath15 @xcite .    from the large-@xmath16 forms of these waves we can extract the ope phase shift , @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> taking the difference between this and the empirical phase shift , @xmath18 , we can define a residual @xmath8-matrix , @xmath19 this describes the additional scattering between the dws , produced by short - range interactions and long - range forces of order @xmath2 and higher . </S>",
    "<S> if we take a @xmath20-shell form for the potential responsible @xmath21 then we can extract its strength directly from @xmath22 , @xmath23 where the superscript ( 2 ) indicates that long - range effects of order @xmath2 and higher are still present .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we use the dwba to subtract the effects of long - range potentials to order @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this leaves a residual short - range potential whose strength is given by @xmath24 where the order-@xmath25 tpe potentials can be found in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and the corresponding order-@xmath2 recoil correction to ope is given by friar @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the tpe potential has terms with @xmath26 and @xmath27 singularities . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the radial integrals in its matrix elements between @xmath28 waves , which have the form @xmath29 for small @xmath16 , contain @xmath7 and @xmath30 divergences . to rectify this , we regularise the integrals by imposing a radial cut - off at the same value of @xmath31 as used in the @xmath20-shell potential . </S>",
    "<S> we can then renormalise the matrix elements by subtracting the sum of these divergent pieces ( a constant which is independent of energy ) .    </S>",
    "<S> , in @xmath32 , plotted against the lab kinetic energy @xmath33 in mev . </S>",
    "<S> the four curves correspond to different nijmegen pwas . </S>",
    "<S> a cut - off radius of @xmath34  fm was used . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we show first , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : v2 ] , the effective short - range potential @xmath35 in the @xmath1 partial wave after the removal of ope only . the cut - off radius of the @xmath20-shell was taken to be @xmath34  fm . </S>",
    "<S> results are shown for pwa93 and three different nijmegen potentials @xcite , all of which provide high - quality fits to the nn scattering data . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that significant energy dependence is present at low energies , like that found in the higher partial waves @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that there may still be important contributions from long - range forces in this interaction . </S>",
    "<S> however we should note that the different nijmegen analyses diverge for energies below about 50  mev and so this region should not be regarded as well constrained by the data . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the centrifugal barrier prevents the nucleons from approaching each other closely at these energies and so the @xmath1 phase shift is completely dominated by ope .    </S>",
    "<S> , in @xmath32 , plotted against the lab kinetic energy @xmath33 in mev . </S>",
    "<S> the different curves show the potentials obtained with cut - off radii @xmath36  fm ( dotted ) , 0.4  fm , 0.2  fm , 0.1  fm , and 0.05  fm ( solid ) . ]    using the dwba to remove the effects of the order-@xmath25 long - range potentials , we obtain the results shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : v4r0 ] and [ fig : v4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix elements of the tpe potential have been renormalised by simply subtracting their values at some very low energy , @xmath37  mev . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : v4r0 ] shows that the renormalised potential does indeed converge to a cut - off - independent form as @xmath38 . for numerical convenience </S>",
    "<S> we present our results for @xmath34  fm , for which any cut - off artefacts ( terms in the potential proportional to positive powers of @xmath31 ) are very small .     for four different nijmegen pwas . a cut - off radius of @xmath34  fm was used . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the resulting renormalised potentials @xmath39 obtained from several nijmegen pwas are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : v4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the  turnover \" at low energies that was visible in fig .  [ fig : v2 ] has been significantly reduced by subtracting the higher - order long - range forces . </S>",
    "<S> however we should point out that much of this effect lies in the region where uncertainties in the pwas make it hard to draw very strong conclusions .    to try to quantify the energy dependence of the residual potential , we made a least squares fit of a quadratic in the energy to @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> we fitted this over the energy range @xmath40  mev , which was chosen to avoid both the low - energy region where the data are too inaccurate to determine the short - range potential reliably , and the high - energy region where our eft is expected to converge slowly if at all . </S>",
    "<S> a quadratic was chosen because attempts to fit higher order polynomials to this range did not lead to stable values for the coefficients .    </S>",
    "<S> writing the polynomial in the form @xmath41 we obtain @xmath42  @xmath43 , @xmath44  @xmath45 and @xmath46  @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> this is dominated by a linear dependence on the energy ( @xmath48 ) , consistent with the visual impression of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : v4 ] . without knowing the uncertainties on the phase shifts that are used to determine the potential , it is difficult to assign definite errors to these coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> however simple estimates suggest that the values for the first two are reasonably accurate but @xmath49 is not .    for present purposes , our main interest in these coefficients is to estimate the scale of the short - distance physics represented by @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the scale that controls the convergence of the expansion of our eft . here </S>",
    "<S> , we can not use @xmath50 for this because it depends on our ( somewhat _ ad hoc _ ) choice of renormalisation scheme . </S>",
    "<S> also , as just noted , the coefficient @xmath49 is not accurately determined and so we are left with only @xmath51 , the coefficient of the term linear in energy .    if our theory has a  natural \" scale dependence , @xmath51 should be of the form @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the scale of the underlying physics and @xmath54 is a dimensionless number of order unity . the higher - order pion - exchange forces that have not been subtracted out </S>",
    "<S> can contribute to this coefficient but , since these are at least of order @xmath55 , their contributions are suppressed by @xmath56 . if we set @xmath57 , then our value of @xmath51 implies a scale of approximately 260  mev . </S>",
    "<S> this is similar to the breakdown scale that was recently estimated for the @xmath5 wave @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such low values for the scales suggest the presence of additional low - energy physics that has not been considered in the present eft . </S>",
    "<S> one important possible example of this is the @xmath58-resonance . an extended theory , including the @xmath58 as an explicit degree of freedom as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , may lead to more natural short - range forces . </S>"
