    "several scenarios in which the quantum gravity scale or the string scale might be @xmath0 have been proposed  @xcite . in these scenarios ,",
    "our space is the 3-brane in large extra dimensions .",
    "these brane world scenarios attract much attention because of their great significance , namely , the possibility of observing the quantum gravity effects in future - planned accelerators . in the far above regime of the planck energy , the characteristic scales of particle interactions are given by the gravitational radius of the system and the classical description is expected to become valid . in this energy scale ,",
    "the black hole production in the high - energy particle collision occurs .",
    "the phenomenology of the black hole production in accelerators was first discussed in  @xcite , and subsequently a great amount of papers concerning this theme have appeared .",
    "one of the necessary investigations is to analyze the black hole formation in the high - energy particle system using the higher - dimensional general relativity . in the author s previous paper with nambu  @xcite , we numerically calculated the apparent horizon in the grazing collision of high - energy particles .",
    "because the apparent horizon formation is the sufficient condition for the black hole formation , our analysis provides the lowerbound of the cross section of the black hole production . in this analysis",
    ", we used the metric of the massless point particle , which is obtained by boosting the schwarzschild black hole to the speed of light , fixing the energy @xmath1",
    "@xcite . however , there are various characters of the particle that might affect its gravitational field , namely , the electric charge , the color charge , the spin , the wave feature ( which was recently pointed out in  @xcite ) , and the length of the string . because one should be able to obtain the metric of high - energy objects to investigate these effects",
    ", the development of such methods is important .    in this paper",
    ", we would like to propose the ( probably ) easiest method for deriving the metric of the objects which is boosted to the speed of light . because using a simple example is useful for this purpose",
    ", we consider the lightlike limit of the boosted kerr black holes in higher - dimensional spacetimes .",
    "the higher - dimensional kerr black hole solution was given by myers and perry  @xcite .",
    "although the higher - dimensional kerr black hole can have more than one kerr parameter , we restrict our attention to the one with only one kerr parameter @xmath2 for simplicity . in this case , the singularity is a one - dimensional rotating ring .",
    "we consider two cases : the boost in the parallel direction to the spin ( i.e. , the velocity vector is orthogonal to the plane with the ring singularity ) and the boost in the transverse direction to the spin ( i.e. , the velocity vector is parallel to the plane with the ring singularity ) . in the boost ,",
    "we fix the energy @xmath1 and the kerr parameter @xmath2 .    in the four - dimensional case , the lightlike limit of the boosted kerr black hole fixing the energy @xmath1 and the kerr parameter @xmath2",
    "has attracted a lot of attentions .",
    "loust and snchez considered the lightlike boost of the kerr black hole in the parallel direction to the spin  @xcite .",
    "they just boosted the metric and succeeded in taking the lightlike limit .",
    "but because they expanded the metric in the calculation , it is applicable only at the distant region from the black hole and the physical interpretation is difficult .",
    "further , their method contained ambiguity as pointed out in  @xcite .",
    "balasin and nachbagauer proposed an alternative method  @xcite .",
    "they calculated the distributional energy - momentum tensor of the kerr black hole and boosted it to the speed of light in arbitrary directions .",
    "then they solved the einstein s equation with this boosted energy - momentum tensor .",
    "barrabs and hogan proposed a somewhat easier method  @xcite , in which they boost the riemann tensor of the kerr black hole to the speed of light and construct the spacetime so that it has the same curvature as the boosted one .",
    "there is also a related work by burinskii and magli  @xcite .",
    "we choose the simplest method here : we just boost the metric without considering the energy - momentum tensor and the riemann tensor . in this sense ,",
    "our method is similar to that of loust and snchez , but we do not expand the metric . using this method , we can analytically derive the lightlike kerr metric in the higher - dimensional spacetimes .",
    "although we reconfirm the ambiguity of this method in the four - dimensional case , we find that there is no such ambiguity in the higher - dimensional cases .",
    "our analysis indicates that our method would be applicable for a wide class of solutions and shows the condition for deriving the analytic metric .",
    "it also indicates that we would be able to calculate the lightlike metric in the general cases at least numerically .",
    "although our motivation is mainly mathematical , we also would like to point out two possible implications of our results .",
    "first , the kerr black hole might provide the model of the gravitational field of a particle with spin .",
    "although the spin angular momentum is different from the orbital angular momentum , there are several discussions about the relation between the spinning particle and the kerr black hole  @xcite .",
    "second , in the string theory , there are several discussions that some black hole solutions should be regarded as the elementary particles  @xcite , or the kerr black hole might be a classical model for the gravitational field of some string  @xcite . in the last section of this paper ,",
    "we give brief discussions about the implications of our results from the viewpoint of these contexts and the brane world scenarios .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we analyze the boost of the kerr black hole in the parallel direction to the spin .",
    "we propose the general strategy to obtain the lightlike limit by just boosting the metric and construct the analytic metric of the lightlike kerr black hole .",
    "then we show that there is no ambiguity in this method in the higher - dimensional cases and discuss the properties of the resulting metric . in sec .",
    "iii , we repeat the similar analysis and discussions in the case of the boost in the transverse direction to the spin .",
    "iv is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "the discussion includes the advantage and the limitation in our method in general cases .",
    "we also discuss the possible implications of our results , namely , the effect of spin and the string length on the black hole formation in the collision of the high - energy particles .",
    "in this section , we consider the lightlike limit of the kerr black hole with one kerr parameter @xmath2 that is boosted in the parallel direction to the spin for total spacetime dimension number @xmath3 .",
    "we introduce the kerr - schild coordinate @xmath4 in which the metric becomes @xmath5 ^ 2,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are defined via @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",

    "the singularity is rotating in the @xmath18-plane . in the boost ,",
    "we fix the energy @xmath19 and the kerr parameter @xmath2 . here",
    ", @xmath20 is the usual @xmath20 factor given by @xmath21 with the velocity of the kerr black hole @xmath22 . for convenience ,",
    "we introduce @xmath23 .",
    "now we consider the lorentz boost in the @xmath24 direction : @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "the boosted metric becomes @xmath27 where @xmath28 . in the limit @xmath29 , this is reduced to @xmath30 the strategy for obtaining this limit is as follows .",
    "we find the primitive function @xmath31 such that @xmath32 then the limit can be obtained by @xmath33 as we will see later , @xmath31 is reduced to @xmath34 where @xmath35 is determined by @xmath36 with the heviside step function @xmath37 .",
    "hence we obtain @xmath38 the key point for writing down the analytic form of the lightlike metric is whether we can obtain this primitive function @xmath31 or not .",
    "note that @xmath39 comes from the even part of @xmath40 with respect to @xmath24 , and the odd part of @xmath40 contributes only to @xmath41 . because we can show that the primitive function of the odd part becomes a finite value independent of @xmath42 in the limit @xmath29 for all @xmath43",
    ", it does not affect the result .",

    "the delta function indicates that the two coordinates in the regions @xmath62 and @xmath63 are discontinuously connected and there is the distributional riemann tensor at @xmath61 , which we call the gravitational shock wave .",
    "the function @xmath39 characterizes the structure of this shock wave and we call it the potential of the shock wave hereafter .    before looking at the behavior of the potential @xmath64 for @xmath3 , we would like to see what occurs in our method in the @xmath65 case . in this case , we should be careful in the following two points .",
    "first , there is no @xmath66 direction and we need not consider @xmath67 . because of this absence of @xmath66 , there are two possible cases for @xmath24=0 : the @xmath68 case and the @xmath69 case . depending on these choices , we should adopt @xmath70 $ ] and @xmath71 $ ] as the integral regions of @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "it turns out later that they lead to different results , which represent the solutions in the @xmath73 region and in the @xmath74 region , respectively .",
    "second , because @xmath75 logarithmically diverges at @xmath76 , we should consider the @xmath77 part of the primitive function  .",
    "if we take the choice such that @xmath51 corresponds to @xmath68 , @xmath75 and @xmath78 are given by @xmath79 and we find @xmath80 . \\label{parallel_4d_result1}\\ ] ] on the other hand , adopting the other choice in which @xmath51 is equivalent to @xmath69 , @xmath75 and @xmath78 become @xmath81 which lead to @xmath82\\delta(z - t ) \\right\\}.",
    "\\label{parallel_4d_result2}\\ ] ] the latter result   is defined only in the region @xmath83 . because the former result   has the same value at @xmath84 as that of eq .",
    ", @xmath85 can be extended to the region @xmath86 using eq .  .",
    "since we can eliminate the @xmath87 term using the proper coordinate transformation , we find that this result is the same as the previous result of  @xcite using the relation @xmath88 .    at this point",
    ", we should point out the ambiguity of this method for @xmath65 .",
    "for example , we can consider the following form instead of eq .",

    "this leads to @xmath91.\\ ] ] instead of eq .  .",
    "this ambiguity is the reason why the previous authors have developed the various methods other than just boosting the metric  @xcite .",
    "in fact , there would not exist the method to determine this factor @xmath90 rigorously without checking the consistency with the boosted energy - momentum tensor or the boosted riemann tensor .",
    "hence the above calculation is just the formal derivation of the lightlike kerr black hole metric .",
    "however , we would like to point out that there is no ambiguity for the higher - dimensional cases , because the primitive function @xmath31 is finite in the limit @xmath29 . hence in the higher - dimensional cases , it is sufficient to consider the boost of the metric and we need not calculate the energy - momentum tensor or the riemann tensor of this system",
    ".    now we discuss the properties of the potential @xmath92 in the higher - dimensional cases .",
    "figure 1 shows the behavior of @xmath39 for @xmath93 . in the @xmath94 case ,",
    "the potential @xmath64 logarithmically diverges at @xmath95 .",
    "hence the shock wave contains a one - dimensional ring - shaped singularity . for @xmath96 ,",
    "the potential @xmath64 diverges at @xmath97 .",
    "hence the singularity is a two - dimensional disk in these cases .",
    "this is interpreted as follows : for @xmath94 , the black hole horizon does not exist in the resulting spacetime because we fixed @xmath2 in the boosting .",
    "the singularity becomes naked and the potential @xmath64 diverges at the singularity .",
    "while for @xmath96 , the horizon exists for arbitrary @xmath11 and @xmath2 .",
    "hence the resulting gravitational shock wave contains an extremely oblate horizon , on which the potential @xmath64 diverges .",
    "the function @xmath64 behaves like @xmath98 for @xmath99 and @xmath100 for @xmath101",
    ". one can understand this potential behavior using the newtonian analogy .",
    "the newtonian potential of @xmath102-dimensional matter distribution in @xmath103-dimensional space is given by @xmath104 for @xmath105 and @xmath106 for @xmath107 . because the shock wave is @xmath17 dimensional ,",
    "the behavior of the potential @xmath64 and the dimensionality of the singularity have the same relation as the newtonian gravity .",
    "hence , we see that these results are consistent with our intuition and we expect that also in general cases we can guess the behavior of @xmath39 to a certain extent , even if the calculation of the primitive function of @xmath40 can not be proceeded .",
    "in this section , we consider the lightlike limit of the boosted kerr black hole in the transverse direction to the spin . in this case",

    "figure 2 shows the potential @xmath64 of the shock wave for @xmath93 . for all @xmath3 ,",
    "the potential diverges at @xmath143 .",
    "hence in the transverse case , the singularity has the shape of a one - dimensional segment for all @xmath3 .",
    "this is interpreted as follows . in the boost ,",
    "the ring singularity becomes naked for @xmath94 and the horizon becomes extremely oblate for @xmath144 this singularity or the horizon is infinitely lorentz - contracted in the direction of the motion .",
    "this leads to the segmental shape of the singularity in the gravitational shock wave .",
    "the behavior of the potential @xmath64 around the singularity is @xmath145 for @xmath94 , and @xmath146 for @xmath96 .",
    "similarly to the parallel case , we see that the relation between the potential behavior near the singularity and the dimensionality of the singularity is the same as the newtonian gravity .",
    "the behavior of the potential is not symmetric to the @xmath147 plane .",
    "this is the manifestation of the fact that the lightlike kerr black hole carries the angular momentum @xmath148 .",
    "the rotating singularity has the velocity in the direction of the boost at @xmath149 and it has the velocity in the converse direction of the boost at @xmath150 .",
    "correspondingly , the divergence of the potential at @xmath149 is stronger than the one at @xmath150 .",
    "in this paper , we have developed the method for taking the lightlike limit of the boosted kerr black holes in the higher - dimensional spacetimes .",
    "we analyzed two cases , the boosts in the parallel direction and in the transverse direction to the spin .",
    "our method is quite simple : just boosting the metric without considering the energy - momentum tensor or the riemann tensor .",
    "the problem is reduced to taking the limit @xmath29 of the function @xmath40 of eqs .   and .",
    "we solved this problem by introducing the primitive function @xmath31 of @xmath40 , taking the limit @xmath29 of @xmath31 , and then differentiating it . because the primitive function @xmath31 is finite for the higher - dimensional cases ,",
    "there is no ambiguity which occurred in the four - dimensional case .",
    "hence , we consider that the boost of the metric is the simplest and easiest method in the higher - dimensional cases .",
    "we discuss whether this method works for the general systems .",
    "also in the general systems , the lightlike limit of the metric would have the form like eq .   or eq .  .",
    "the problem is whether we can construct the primitive function of @xmath40 . if not , we can not analytically derive the metric of the lightlike system",
    "this is the limitation in our method .",
    "but even if we can not find the primitive function of @xmath40 , there remains the possibility that we can numerically construct the potential @xmath64 .",
    "namely , if @xmath64 is reduced to the form like eqs .  , , and , it is easy to calculate the potential @xmath64 at each point by numerical integrals .",
    "hence , our analysis shows the direction of the calculation at which we should aim in general cases .",
    "we also would like to mention that we can guess the resulting potential @xmath64 to some extent even if we fail the above directions , because the results are quite consistent with our intuition .",
    "we can intuitively imagine the shape of the infinitely lorentz - contracted source and guess the shape of the potential @xmath64 by the newtonian analog .",
    "now we discuss the possible implications of our results in the context of the brane world scenario .",
    "there are several discussions that the kerr black hole might provide the gravitational field of the elementary particle with spin  @xcite , especially motivated by the fact that the kerr - newman black hole has the same gyromagnetic ratio as that of the electron .",
    "we consider that this scenario is unlikely , because the electron in this model has the characteristic scale @xmath2 , whose value is similar to its compton wave length .",
    "furthermore , we do not have the criterion for determining @xmath2 in the case of a massless spinning particle .",
    "however , we can expect that the spin has an effect on the gravitational field of the elementary particle , although the spin angular momentum and the orbital angular momentum are different .",
    "this expectation comes from the fact that the sum of the spin and orbital angular momentum is the conserved quantity .",
    "it is natural that the conserved quantity affects the spacetime structure .",
    "this expectation is strengthened by the following observation . if the black hole forms in the head - on collision of spinning particles , the produced black hole would have the angular momentum that corresponds to the sum of two spins . in order that the black hole has the angular momentum",
    ", the gravitational field of each particle should not be the same as that of the massless point particle given in @xcite .",
    "because the lightlike kerr black hole has the quite different gravitational field from that of the massless point particle , we can also expect that the spin of a particle has a large effect on its gravitational field .",
    "hence it would affect the condition of the black hole formation in the high - energy particle collisions . to clarify this",
    ", the investigation of the einstsein - dirac system would be useful .",
    "as the first step , the classical field treatment would be appropriate .",
    "the formalism of this system was recently developed by finster  @xcite , and finster _",
    "_ constructed the spin singlet state of two fermions  @xcite .",
    "the generalization to the spin eigenstate of one particle and its lightlike boost would be an interesting next problem .",
    "now we turn to the discussion about another possible implication , the relation between the kerr black holes and the strings . in the string theory , there are several discussions that some black holes should be regarded as the elementary particles  @xcite",
    ". our formalism would also be applicable to these black hole solutions .",
    "furthermore , nishino  @xcite and nishino and rajpoot  @xcite discussed the fact that the kerr black hole might be the classical model of the gravitational field around the closed string , simply because the kerr black hole has the distributional energy - momentum tensor on its singularity . hence , our boosted kerr solution might have an implication for the black hole formation in the collision of high - energy strings with characteristic length scale @xmath2 .",
    "investigatiton of the properties of the black hole formation in the collision of two lightlike kerr strings requires the analysis of the apparent horizon , which we have not done . but",
    "using the fact that each incoming kerr string has a singularity with the characteristic scale @xmath2 , we can discuss the condition for the black hole formation as follows .",
    "for some impact parameter @xmath151 , we write the horizon shape in the case of the two - point - particle collision which has been calculated in @xcite .",
    "then we draw on it the shape of the singularity of the lightlike kerr strings with kerr parameter @xmath2 .",
    "if the singularity crosses the horizon , the apparent horizon would not form for such @xmath151 and @xmath2 . under this assumption",
    ", we can calculate the maximal impact parameter of the black hole production as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "figure 3 shows the expected maximal impact parameter @xmath152 for the black hole production in the collision of two kerr strings which are boosted in the direction of the spin . if the kerr parameter @xmath2 ( i.e. , the length of the string ) is small compared to the gravitational radius of the system energy @xmath153 , it does not affect the black hole formation . but @xmath152 decreases with the increase in @xmath2 , and becomes zero at @xmath154 .",
    "we can write a similar figure in the case of two lightlike kerr strings which are boosted in the transverse direction to the spin .",
    "hence , the condition for @xmath155 is written as @xmath156 .",
    "if the planck energy is @xmath157 and the string length @xmath2 is similar to the planck length , the gravitational radius for the two particle system becomes @xmath158 if the incoming energy is ( few ) tev .",
    "hence the string length might have the effect such that it prevents the black hole formation .",
    "we should mention that the above discussion is not rigorous , because we do not know the validity of the assumption we have used .",
    "we can also have the totally different expectation , because in the higher - dimensional spacetime , the arbitarily long black hole can form as clarified by ida and nakao  @xcite .",
    "the higher - dimensional effect might lead to the formation of the long apparent horizon in the high - energy string collision depending on the shape of two strings .",
    "if this is true , the cross section for the black hole production might be enhanced .",
    "furthermore , we can also expect the formation of the black ring , which is the higher - dimensional black hole whose horizon topology is @xmath159 .",
    "( see @xcite for the five - dimensional solution . )",
    "if the shape of two strings at the instant of the collision is similar to the ring , the ring - shaped apparent horizon that surrounds the two strings might form .",
    "although the author and nambu discussed one possible method to produce the black rings in particle systems in the previous paper  @xcite , it required more than two particles . if the black ring forms due to the effect of the string length , it would be the more interesting phenomena . to clarify the effect of the string length on the black hole formation in the high - energy string collisions would be the interesting problem to be tackled as the next step .",
