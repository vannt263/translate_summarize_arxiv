    "since its discovery in the early eighties , the jones polynomial of links in @xmath1 has been one of the most studied objects in low - dimensional topology . despite this , at present , it is not yet completely clear which topological informations are carried and how are encoded by this invariant and more in general by the larger family of quantum invariants .",
    "one of the most important conjectural relations between the topology of a link in a manifold and its quantum invariants has been given by kashaev through his volume conjecture for hyperbolic links @xmath2 in @xmath1 ( @xcite ) , based on complex valued link invariants @xmath3 constructed by using planar @xmath4-tangle presentations of @xmath2 and constant kashaev s @xmath5-matrices ( @xcite ) . later murakami - murakami ( @xcite ) identified kashaev s invariants as special evaluations of certain colored jones polynomials , and extended the volume conjecture to non - necessarily hyperbolic links in @xmath1 by replacing the hyperbolic volume of @xmath6 with the ( normalized ) gromov norm .",
    "let us state more precisely this volume conjecture .",
    "let us recall that , using the irreducible representations of @xmath7 , it is possible to assign to each link @xmath8 a sequence of laurent polynomials @xmath9 , called the @xmath10-colored jones polynomials of @xmath2 so that @xmath11 only depends on the isotopy class of @xmath2 and all the polynomials associated to the unknot are equal to @xmath12 ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the volume conjecture states the following : @xmath13 where by @xmath14 we denote the ( normalized ) gromov norm of @xmath15 and by @xmath16 the evaluation in @xmath17 .",
    "the vc in this form has been formally checked for the figure eight knot ( @xcite ) and for a class of non - hyperbolic knots including torus knots ( @xcite , @xcite ) . moreover , there are experimental evidences of its validity for knots @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 and for the whitehead link ( @xcite ) .",
    "more recently baseilhac and benedetti have constructed a @xmath21-dimensional so called  quantum _ hyperbolic _ field theory \" ( qhft ) , which includes invariants @xmath22 ( @xmath23 being any odd integer ) , where @xmath24 is an arbitrary oriented closed @xmath25-manifold , and either @xmath2 is a non - empty link in @xmath24 and @xmath26 is a principal flat @xmath27-bundle on @xmath24 ( up to gauge transformation ) ( @xcite , @xcite ) , or @xmath2 is a _ framed _ link and @xmath26 is defined on @xmath28 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the state - sums giving @xmath22 for @xmath29 are in fact non commutative generalizations ( see @xcite ) of known simplicial formulas ( @xcite ) for @xmath30 , the chern - simons invariant and the volume of @xmath26 , which coincide with the usual geometric ones when @xmath26 corresponds to the holonomy of a finite volume hyperbolic @xmath25-manifold .",
    "each @xmath22 is well defined up to @xmath31-roots of unity multiplicative factors .",
    "it is a non trivial fact ( see @xcite ) that when @xmath32 and @xmath26 is necessarily the trivial flat @xmath27-bundle on @xmath1 , the kashaev s invariants @xmath3 coincide with @xmath33 up to the above phase ambiguity .",
    "we recall that in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite different instances of general  volume conjectures \" have been formulated in the qhft framework . roughly speaking ,",
    "these predict that , in suitable geometric situations ( for example related to hyperbolic dehn filling and the convergence of closed hyperbolic @xmath25-manifolds to manifolds with cusps ) , the quantum state sums asymptotically recover a classical simplicial formula , when @xmath34 .",
    "however , we note that kashaev s vc ( even if reformulated in terms of @xmath33 ) is _ not _ a specialization of such qhft volume conjectures .",
    "one of the many difficulties in checking the volume conjecture in any of its instances is that in general the formulas describing the @xmath10-colored jones polynomials of a link in @xmath1 , or the state - sums giving @xmath22 , become more and more complicated while @xmath10 grows .",
    "moreover , both diagrams of hyperbolic knots in @xmath1 and decorated triangulations of @xmath35 supporting the qhft state - sums are usually quite complicated , so that , in the hyperbolic case , one almost immediately faces ugly formulas .    in order to test the  vc \" in new hyperbolic cases , we have by - passed this problem in the following way :    1 .",
    "there is a particularly interesting _ infinite _ family of hyperbolic links in @xmath36 , @xmath37 , called _ universal hyperbolic links _ , discovered by the author and d.p .",
    "thurston ( @xcite ) ; 2 .",
    "each universal hyperbolic link has a particularly simple presentations through turaev s shadows theory ; 3 .   for links in @xmath1",
    ", there is a state - sum formulation of @xmath10-colored jones polynomials based on turaev s shadows ( @xcite,@xcite ) ; 4",
    ".   then we extend the shadow definition of the @xmath10-colored jones polynomials to links in @xmath36 , @xmath38 ; 5 .",
    "finally we prove that a natural extension of kashaev s vc , in terms of these generalized jones invariants , actually holds for universal hyperbolic links .",
    "a natural question arises whose answer is still unknown to us :    are the evaluations of the jones invariants for a link @xmath2 in @xmath36 ( for odd @xmath10 ) , entering this extended kashaev s vc , special instances of the above qhft invariants ( presumably @xmath39 , @xmath40 being again the trivial flat @xmath27-bundle ?",
    "we now briefly summarize the contents of the paper .",
    "after recalling ( in section [ simplepoly ] ) the basic machinery and results on shadows of links in @xmath25-manifolds , in section [ sec : jones ] , we extend the definition of the colored jones invariants using the shadow - based state - sum formulation of the reshetikhin - turaev invariants of @xmath25-manifolds ( see @xcite and @xcite ) . as a result we prove theorem [ teo : jones ] restated below in a slightly simplified form :    let @xmath2 be a framed trivalent graph in an oriented @xmath25-manifold @xmath41 diffeomorphic to a connected sum of @xmath42 copies @xmath43 or to @xmath1 .",
    "there exist rational functions @xmath44 which are invariant up to homeomorphism of the pair @xmath45 and extend the reshetikhin - turaev invariants .",
    "moreover , if @xmath46 and @xmath2 is a link , @xmath47 is the @xmath10-colored framed jones polynomial normalized so that its value on the @xmath48 framed unknot is @xmath12 .    for the sake of completeness ,",
    "let us note that there exists also a generalization of jones polynomials to the case of links in lens spaces provided by hoste and przytycki ( @xcite ) .    in the same section , we give examples of computations and recall the construction of the universal hyperbolic links . after recalling the many interesting properties shared by these links , we provide a particularly simple formula for their @xmath10-colored jones invariants .    in the last section , after discussing how to extend the vc to the case of links in @xmath49 through the @xmath10-colored jones invariants and recalling some definitions and results on the lobatchevskji function , we prove the following ( theorem [ teo : vcvera ] below ) :    the extended volume conjecture is true for all the universal hyperbolic links .",
