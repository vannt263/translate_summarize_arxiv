    "physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) can manifest itself by altering the expected rates of flavor - changing neutral - current ( fcnc ) interactions .",
    "thus , testing sm and probing new physics through top quark fcnc decay is interesting .",
    "the top quark fcnc processes @xmath10 ( @xmath2 ) have tiny branching ratios in the sm and are probably unmeasurable at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) and future colliders .",
    "therefore , any positive signal of these rare decay events would imply new physics beyond the sm .",
    "as the lhc will produce abundant top quark events ( about @xmath11 per year ) , even in the initial low luminosity run ( @xmath12 ) @xmath13 top - quark pairs and @xmath14 single top quarks will be produced yearly .",
    "thus one may anticipate to discover the first hint of new physics by observing anomalous couplings in the top - quark sector .",
    "recently , from their measurements of the total cross sections , both d0 @xcite and cdf @xcite collaborations at the fermilab tevatron have searched for nonstandard - model single top quark production and set upper limits on the anomalous fcnc couplings @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where the leading order ( lo ) cross sections have been scaled to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) @xcite ( or resummation @xcite ) predictions . at the lhc",
    ", atlas collaboration has presented its sensitivity by studying fcnc top decays @xcite .",
    "these results show that top quark fcnc couplings will provide a good probe to new physics beyond the sm .",
    "although there are many discussions in the literatures on top quark production and rare decay processes involving model - independent top quark fcnc couplings @xcite , most of them were based on lo calculations .",
    "however , especially for @xmath5 , due to the large uncertainties from the renormalization scale dependence in its lo prediction through the strong coupling constant @xmath17 , it is necessary to improve the theoretical prediction to nlo in order to match the expected experimental accuracy at the lhc . because of the importance of nlo corrections for the experiments @xcite , we calculated the nlo qcd corrections to the partial decay widths and decay branching ratios of top quark fcnc processes @xmath18 more than one year ago @xcite .    in this paper , we describe in detail the calculations in ref .  @xcite and consider the fcnc operator mixing effects which were ignored in ref .  @xcite .",
