    "if supersymmetry ( susy ) is the solution to the hierarchy problem , the superpartners should weigh around a few hundred gev to tev energy range , which is accessible at the lhc experiments . the way to discover susy or to measure the properties of susy particles are quite different depending on the pattern of the superparticle spectrum .",
    "in particular , the property of the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) is important for the search strategies .    motivated by an explanation of dark matter of the universe ,",
    "many collider studies of susy models have assumed the case with the lsp being the neutralino ( admixture of the higgsinos and the gauginos ) . in the neutralino lsp case , the final states of the susy events always contain invisible neutralinos , and one needs various measurements to be combined in order to determine sparticle masses .",
    "the situation drastically changes if one assumes that one of the charged sleptons is lighter than the lightest neutralino .",
    "such a scenario is possible if the slepton is not absolutely stable .",
    "for example , the slepton can decay into a lepton and gravitino if kinematically allowed .",
    "in particular , the scalar tau lepton ( stau ) can easily be lighter than the neutralino in many susy models due to the quantum correction through the large yukawa interaction .",
    "if the life - time of the stau is longer than the time scale of the collider experiments ( a few nsec ) , we will see charged tracks left by staus in each susy events , instead of the missing momentum in the neutralino lsp scenario . methods to search for a long - lived charged particle in hadron colliders have been studied in refs .",
    "also , various advantages in studying susy models at the lhc have been reported .",
    "the stau momenta and velocities can be measured by analyzing the stau tracks , from which the stau mass can be extracted with a good accuracy  @xcite .",
    "the measurements of other sparticle masses  @xcite and the spin measurement of the stau  @xcite have also been discussed .",
    "methods to measure the stau life - time have been proposed in various contexts  @xcite .",
    "the chargino - neutralino production and subsequent decay processes at the lhc have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and the possibilities to observe parity / cp violations have been discussed .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the possibility to measure the tau polarization in the neutralino decay , @xmath1 , where the neutralinos are mainly produced by the cascade decays of colored susy particles .",
    "the tau polarization carries information on whether the lightest stau is the partner of the right- or left - handed tau lepton , and also whether the decaying neutralino is mainly composed of the gauginos or the higgsinos .",
    "the polarization can be determined by looking at the energy distribution of the @xmath2-decay product  @xcite due to the fact that the weak interaction maximally violates parity .",
    "we use the leptonic decay mode of the tau lepton , @xmath3 , in this work .",
    "we first show the formula for the lepton - energy distribution in the neutralino decay , and by using it we fit the data from the monte carlo simulation .",
    "we find that the size of parity violation ( the tau polarization ) can be measured in a simple model where only one of the neutralinos contributes to the final state . in a more complicated case , where there are two neutralinos contribute to the same final state",
    ", we can correctly reproduce the signs of parity violation in each decay vertex .",
    "in this section , we present the differential decay width of @xmath4 as a function of the lepton - energy fraction .",
    "the parity asymmetry of this decay process carries information on the chirality of the stau and the composition of the neutralino , _",
    "i.e. , _ whether it is gaugino - like or higgsino - like .",
    "the measurement of the tau polarization has also been studied in the neutralino lsp case .",

    "( [ eq : fittingby8 ] ) , the combinations of @xmath81 represent the average values of @xmath82 from the @xmath83 decay in the laboratory frame .",

    "( [ eq : fittingby8 ] ) : @xmath90 we obtain the correct signs for each parity violation although the magnitude of the parity violation is obtained to be smaller than the theoretical input values ( @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively ) due to our simple ansatz on the fitting function .",
    "we studied the polarization measurement of the tau lepton at the lhc in the long - lived stau scenario .",
    "the polarization of the tau lepton from the neutralino decays carries information on whether the neutralino is higgsino - like or gaugino - like and the chirality of the partner of the stau .",
    "we have shown that the @xmath2 polarization can be measured by fitting the distribution of the lepton - energy fraction ( @xmath93 ) in the leptonic @xmath2 decays .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulations for two parameter sets of the mssm .",
    "the first example we took is a simple case where the bino - like neutralino is significantly lighter than others . in this case",
    ", we can directly fit the energy fraction by the theoretical function and the parity violation can be measured successfully .    in the second case where the wino - like neutralino also contributes to the same final state , we fit the @xmath72-@xmath64 invariant mass distribution with the two contributions summed .",
    "although the fitting gives a milder asymmetry compared to the theoretical inputs , we can obtain qualitatively correct features of parity violation in each neutralino decay .",
