    "modern elementary particle field theories are based on principe of the gauge invariance .",
    "it means that the lagrangian of the theory should be invariant with respect to group transformation of the local symmetry which leads to a corresponding number of massless vector gauge boson fields . in the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "based on the @xmath1 gauge symmetry group , 12 gauge vector bosons exist .",
    "three of them , the electroweak bosons @xmath2 and @xmath3 , get masses due to the higgs mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking . the eight massless strongly interacting gauge bosons , the gluons , are confined in hadrons and only one directly observed massless neutral vector boson , the well known photon , exists within the sm .    although the standard model does not require any additional gauge fields it is possible to introduce gauge invariant operators in the lagrangian which involve new gauge fields not forbidden by basic principe of gauge invariance .",
    "an example is given in @xcite by the abelian kinetic mixing of the sm @xmath4 field with a new @xmath5 field in a gauge invariant manner .",
    "the mixing term of the two @xmath6 fields can be diagonalized and canonically normalized by an @xmath7 transformation in a way that one linear combination of the fields corresponds to the ordinary photon which couples in the usual manner to all electrically charged particles within the sm .",
    "the other linear combination appears as a massless spin-1 neutral particle , referred to as the paraphoton in @xcite and denoted by @xmath8 in this paper .",
    "this mechanism also provides an elegant way of introducing millicharged particles group .",
    "interaction of these particles with sm fields should be very small and proportional to the kinetic mixing parameter . ] into the theory @xcite .",
    "the paraphoton couples directly to millicharged fermions and only indirectly to the sm fields via higher mass - dimension operators .    in this study",
    "we follow an approach proposed in @xcite where the effective lagrangian of the interaction of the paraphoton with the sm fermion fields was proposed by considering higher dimensional operators . a possible lowest order lagrangian which preserves both the new @xmath5 and the sm gauge symmetries with the sm fermion cirality structure has the following form : @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the quark and lepton doublets , @xmath11 the up and down - type @xmath12 singlet quarks , @xmath13 the electrically - charged @xmath12-singlet leptons , and @xmath14 is the higgs doublet .",
    "an index labeling the three fermions generations is implicit here .",
    "the @xmath15 matrices in flavor space , @xmath16 , have dimensionless complex elements , and @xmath17 is the mass scale where the operators are generated .",
    "one can see that the interactions of the paraphoton with standard model fermions are suppressed by two powers of the mass scale @xmath17 , but are directly proportional to the fermion mass @xmath18 and the dimensionless coupling strength parameter @xmath19 , with @xmath20 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath19 are unknown , but various phenomenological constraints exist .",
    "in particular , limits on these parameters for light fermions were , for example , deduced from paraphoton annihilation to muon pairs , @xmath21 , or the compton - like process , @xmath22 , assuming the @xmath8 interaction rate equals the expansion rate of the universe at freeze out .",
    "together with successful predictions of primordial nucleon - synthesis the @xmath23 coupling parameter is bounded to @xmath24 tev , where @xmath25 is related to @xmath26 via @xmath27 , with @xmath28 the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field . or",
    ", star cooling by @xmath8 emission constraints the electron - paraphoton interaction since the associated energy loss is proportional to the square of @xmath29 .",
    "the limit on @xmath8 emission through bremsstrahlung , such as @xmath30 , from the core of red giant stars @xcite requires @xmath31 tev , while compton - like scattering , @xmath32 , in horizontal - branch stars sets a somewhat weaker limit of @xmath33 tev .",
    "a constraint on the @xmath8-coupling to nucleons of @xmath34 tev has been estimated from the neutrino signal of the supernova 1987a assuming the supernova was cooled predominantly by neutrinos .",
    "more details of possible lower limits on @xmath8 interactions with fermions are discussed in @xcite .",
    "an intriguing aspect of the presence of an additional gauge field like the paraphoton is the possible existence of fields charged under the @xmath5 group .",
    "simple renormalizable models generate operators , see eq.(1 ) , which are associated with new heavy states . the lightest particle of this type with negligible electrical charge is stable and",
    "could be a viable dark matter candidate .    to summarize , a massless neutral gauge boson other than the sm photon may exist .",
    "it interacts with ordinary matter via higher - order operators .",
    "the rather weak bounds on the mass scale m makes it worthwhile to search for this new photon - like state in future collider experiments . from the lagrangian , eq.(1 ) , follows that due to the proportionality of the @xmath8 couplings to the fermion mass , @xmath8 interaction with sm particles is strongest with particles of the third generation , especially with the top quark , and small or negligible with light fermions .",
    "therefore , we expect that the most interesting process to search for the paraphoton will be @xmath8 radiation off the top quark",
    ". since so far no constraint on @xmath35 exists , access to @xmath36 seems possible or corresponding limits might be set for the first time .",
    "it seems a priori very difficult to perform @xmath8 searches at hadron colliders because of copious @xmath37 + multi - jet background production .",
    "the next generation @xmath0 linear collider ( ilc ) is ideally suited to evaluate prospects of a search for the paraphoton via the channel @xmath38 the search strategy relies on the property of the @xmath8 to interact weakly with ordinary matter and its favored emission from top quarks .",
    "hence , the signal signature consists of a pair of acoplanar top quark jets with missing transverse energy ,  , carried away by the paraphoton . the rate of such events if noticed should clearly exceed the expected sm background .",
    "simulations of @xmath39 signal events with a reasonable value of the coupling parameter @xmath36 and sm background reactions were performed at center - of - mass energies @xmath40 and 1.0 tev and an integrated luminosity of 0.5 , respectively , 1 ab@xmath41 . these assumptions are in accord with the present design for the ilc , initially producing collisions at 0.5 tev and in a second stage at 1 tev @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "basic properties of signal events are studied at the parton level in order to extract informations which might be helpful to discriminate signal from background events .",
    "section 3 describes the search strategy for the @xmath8 based on hadronic @xmath42 decays , @xmath43 , to avoid complications from leptonic @xmath42 decays with neutrinos in the final state , also carrying away transverse energy .",
    "the analysis is performed based on full simulation including ilc detector response .",
    "section 4 discusses accessible limits on @xmath36 from excess of signal events over the sm background expectations and arguments in favor of the nature of the paraphoton are presented .",
    "conclusions are summarized in section 5 .",
    "the characteristics of the signal reaction @xmath44 were computed and corresponding partonic events were generated by means of the program package comphep @xcite .",
    "the feynman rules for the fermion - fermion-@xmath8 vertices following from the effective lagrangian ( 1 ) @xmath45 have been implemented into comphep allowing variations of the free coupling parameter @xmath36 .",
    "an interface with pythia 6.202 @xcite simulates initial and final state radiation and jet hadronization , needed at a later stage of our study .",
    "also , beamstrahlung effects @xcite are taken into account .",
    "table 1 shows the number of signal events expected at @xmath46 and 1 tev as a function of @xmath36 for an accumulated luminosity of 0.5 , respectively , 1 ab@xmath41 .",
    "the event rates become rapidly smaller with increasing @xmath36 , so that in particular for large @xmath36 values @xmath8 detection is challenging .",
    "simulations were only performed for @xmath36 = 0.2 tev enabling sufficient @xmath8 events at both energies .",
    "it is worth to mention that below @xmath47 0.1 tev the kinetic mixing parameter of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 becomes relatively large and leads to millicharged particles with electric charges larger than @xmath48 .",
    "such particles should have been detected in various sm reactions , contrary to experimental findings .",
    "one should also point out that the effective interaction lagrangian approach can not be applied for @xmath49 0.1 tev since the effective coupling parameter @xmath50 gets to large for typical collision energies @xmath51 .    .",
    "@xmath39 event rates for several values of @xmath36 at @xmath46 and 1 tev and an integrated luminosity of 0.5 , respectively , 1 ab@xmath41 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "some realistic extensions of the standard model of elementary particle physics suggest the existence of a new massless neutral gauge boson , denoted as the paraphoton @xmath8 in this study .",
    "this particle is similar to the ordinary photon , but the couplings of the @xmath8 are very distinct : interactions with sm fermions are negligible except those with the top quark .",
    "hence , if the paraphoton is radiated off the top the signature of @xmath8 events in the channel @xmath44 consists of a pair of acoplanar top quark jets with missing transverse energy ,  , carried away by the paraphoton .",
    "only the all - hadronic top decay mode was selected to ensure a high signal - to - background ratio and to avoid complications due to final state neutrinos in leptonic w decays .    based on a multivariate search strategy prospects to discover the @xmath8 at the ilc are studied .",
    "this method was necessary to pursue because large @xmath52 sm background , small signal event rates and little discrimination power of variables restricted an effective signal selection by the method of consecutive cuts . maximizing the probability of each event to be a paraphoton candidate , 49% ( 76% ) of the signal ( s ) at 0.5 ( 1 ) tev was selected and the background ( b ) strongly suppressed , resulting to a @xmath53 larger than 150 at @xmath54 tev . allowing for a 5@xmath55 @xmath8 discovery significance , limits on the paraphoton - top quark coupling @xmath36 were derived . assuming that the sm provides the only source of background , @xmath0 collisions at 1 tev will bound this parameter to @xmath56 tev , which seems to be the most stringent limit accessible at the next generation colliders since huge background expected at the lhc",

    "the ellis - karliner angle and the polar angle of the normal to the @xmath57 plane as a function of a thrust cut - off , were studied to establish the vector nature of the @xmath8 .",
