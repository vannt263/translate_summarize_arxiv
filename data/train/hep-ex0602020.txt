    "measurements of particle electric - dipole moments ( edms ) @xcite are of significant interest because they provide some of the tightest constraints on extensions to the standard model , such as supersymmetry , that attempt to explain the mechanisms underlying cp violation @xcite .    this neutron - edm experiment , and the performance of its cohabiting mercury magnetometer ,",
    "have been discussed in earlier publications @xcite .",
    "the final result presented in this letter incorporates a comprehensive analysis of systematic errors , some of which were undiscovered at the time of the earlier measurements .",
    "the measurement was made with ultracold neutrons ( ucns ) stored in a trap permeated by uniform @xmath0- and @xmath1-fields .",
    "this adds terms @xmath2 and @xmath3 to the hamiltonian determining the states of the neutron .",
    "given parallel @xmath4 and @xmath1 fields , the larmor frequency @xmath5 with which the neutron spin polarization precesses about the field direction is @xmath6 for antiparallel fields , @xmath7 .",
    "thus the experiment aimed to measure any shift in the transition frequency @xmath8 as an applied @xmath9 field alternated between being parallel and then antiparallel to @xmath1 .",
    "a schematic of the apparatus is shown in [ fig : edm_app ] .",
    "the ucns were prepared in a spin - polarized state by transmission through a thin , magnetized iron foil , and entered a cylindrical 21-liter trap within a 1 @xmath10 t uniform vertical magnetic field .",
    "approximately 20  s were needed to fill the trap with neutrons , after which the entrance door was closed pneumatically . the electric field , of approximately 10 kv / cm , was generated by applying high voltage to the electrode that constituted the roof of the trap , while keeping the floor electrode grounded .",
    "the electrodes were made of diamond - like - carbon coated al , and the side wall was sio@xmath11 .",
    "the transition frequency @xmath8 of the neutrons was measured using the ramsey separated oscillatory field magnetic resonance method . during the storage period ,",
    "the neutrons interacted coherently with two 2 s intervals of oscillating magnetic field having a chosen frequency close to the larmor frequency .",
    "the two intervals were separated by a period @xmath12 s of free precession . the last step was to count the number of neutrons @xmath13 and @xmath14 that finished in each of the two polarization states .",
    "this was achieved by opening the entrance door to the trap and allowing the neutrons to fall down onto the polarizing foil , which then acted as a spin analyzer . only those in the initial spin state could pass through to the detector , which was a proportional counter in which neutrons were detected via the reaction @xmath15he @xmath16h@xmath17 during one half of the counting period , an r.f .",
    "magnetic field was applied in the region above the polarizing foil ; this flipped the spins of the neutrons , thereby also allowing those in the opposite spin state to be counted .",
    "each batch cycle yielded about 14,000 ucn counts . within a run",
    "the data - taking operations were cycled continuously for 1 - 2 days . periodically , after a preset number ( normally 16 ) of batches , the direction of @xmath9 was reversed .",
    "all other settings were held constant during a run .",
    "every 10 - 20 runs ,  was reversed so that half of the full data set was taken with  upwards and half with  downwards .",
    "we adopt a system as in @xcite where the @xmath18 vector of our @xmath19 axis follows the direction of .",
    "hence , @xmath20 is always positive , while the gravitational displacement of the ucns changes sign .",
    "the magnetometer used the precession frequency of @xmath21 atoms of @xmath22hg ( @xmath23 atoms/@xmath24 ; @xmath25 ) stored simultaneously in the same trap as the neutrons . using ( [ eqn : hnu ] ) for both ucns and hg , and assuming that both experience the same @xmath26 , we find that to first order in the edms @xmath27 , @xmath28 for each run , @xmath29 was obtained from a linear fit to the ratio @xmath30 versus @xmath31 .",
    "( [ eqn : freq_ratio ] ) shows that @xmath29 contains a contribution from @xmath32 .",
    "the true @xmath32 has been shown to be @xmath33 @xcite , so it introduces a systematic error of @xmath34  into @xmath29 .",
    "to the true @xmath35 and @xmath32 within @xmath29 there will also be added coefficients of fractional shifts in @xmath36 and @xmath37 , from other causes , which are linear in @xmath31 and thus constitute additional systematic errors .",
    "the most important of these involves a geometric phase ( gp ) arising when the trapped particles experience a gradient @xmath38 in the presence of @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the centre of gravity of our ucns is @xmath39 cm lower than that of the ( warmer ) hg atoms , so an observed shift of @xmath30 away from @xmath40 gives a measure of the volume - averaged @xmath41 , via the result ( 86 in @xcite ) @xmath42 where the + sign corresponds to  downwards .    in this experiment",
    "the contribution of the gp effect in the hg to @xmath29 is 50 times larger than the gp effect of the ucns .",
    "writing the gp false contribution to @xmath29 from the hg as @xmath43 , it is shown in @xcite ( 87 ) that @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the trap radius and the + sign again corresponds to  downwards .",
    "it follows that we can write @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the true @xmath35 plus all other systematic effects discussed below , and @xmath48 is the value of @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "[ eqn : d_meas ] defines two straight lines , one with positive slope for  down and one with a negative slope for  up .",
    "the crossing point @xmath51 provides an estimator of @xmath47 free of @xmath52 .",
    "each run was made at a chosen value of @xmath49 by pre - adjusting currents in field - trimming coils .",
    "[ fig : edm_vs_r ] shows the data ( binned for clarity ) for @xmath29 as a function of @xmath49 for each direction of .",
    "the lines represent a least - squares fit to all 554 of the ( unbinned ) run results , using as free parameters the two intercepts and a common absolute slope @xmath53 .",
    "this yields @xmath54 = 652/551 and @xmath55 , which is within 1.3@xmath56 of the expected value of  from ( [ eqn : daf_hgn ] ) .",
    "the slope @xmath53 can be altered by a few percent ( although still remaining highly symmetric under  reversal ) by various mechanisms including the ucns own gp signal ( a 2% effect ) ; uncertainty in @xmath57 ( 4% ) ; a slight reduction in mean free path due to cavities and grooves in the electrodes as well as to the presence of 10@xmath58 torr of he gas to prevent sparks @xcite ( 1% ) ; and asymmetric surface relaxation of the hg ( up to 5% ) .",
    "there are some processes that can interfere with the above gp error removal  essentially any process that changes @xmath49 and/or @xmath52 without conforming to the ratio between the two given by ( [ eqn : daf_hgn ] ) , and where , in addition , the changes differ with the direction of .",
    "first , there are several processes that shift @xmath49 but not @xmath52 . changing @xmath59 , for example , shifts the two lines of 2 in the same direction by the same amount , leaving @xmath47 unaffected but changing @xmath48 .",
    "we note at this point that our final @xmath48 is consistent with the @xmath59 value from the literature ( 1@xmath60 ppm ) @xcite , after allowing for our observed @xmath61 and @xmath62 fields with finite @xmath63 and/or @xmath64 but with ( @xmath65 ( e.g. , a quadrupole aligned with z , with @xmath66 ) , which cause @xmath49 to increase @xcite without contributing to @xmath52 .",
    "any change in such fields when  is reversed can result in a differential shift of all @xmath49 values , and thus of the two lines , thereby changing @xmath48 and @xmath47 .",
    "below , we describe our measurements of the differential shift in @xmath48 and state the correction to @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath26-field averaging in the trap is affected by localised loss of ucn and hg particles , and by polarization loss in the presence of the @xmath67 fractional @xmath20 inhomogeneities , which may change with  direction .",
    "however , we estimate that the resulting @xmath49 shifts are @xmath68 ppm and @xmath69 ppm for the ucn and hg respectively , and that they will be indistinguishable from the quadrupole shifts .    light shifts @xcite in @xmath37 will shift @xmath49 .",
    "they are produced by any small component , parallel to , of the @xmath70hg probe light beam passing through the precessing @xmath22hg atoms .",
    "this component , and the @xmath49 shift , reverse sign on reversal of .",
    "a slight dependence of @xmath49 on the incident light intensity was indeed found , the magnitude @xmath71 ppm being in agreement with theory .",
    "a correction to @xmath29 was made on a run - by - run basis , leading to an overall correction of @xmath72 .",
    "second , there are processes that generate an enhanced @xmath73 .",
    "the field of a permanent magnetic dipole ( pmd ) close to the trap makes a non - uniform @xmath74 and adds an ( enhanced ) gp @xmath75 @xcite to @xmath73 , but shifts @xmath49 in accord with ( [ eqn : freq_ratio ] ) and in opposite senses for the two  directions .",
    "the two changes are in a ratio greater than that given by ( [ eqn : daf_hgn ] ) .",
    "this shifts the lines of 2 upwards , adding @xmath76 to @xmath47 , where @xmath77 is the prediction of ( [ eqn : daf_hgn ] ) for the @xmath78 of this pmd .",
    "our fluxgate magnetometer surveys of the trap can not rule out pmd fields of less than 1 nt at 2 cm from the inner surface .",
    "large areas of the trap are sio@xmath11 or al , backed by large voids , and do not come under suspicion ; but the hg and ucn doors involve a heterogeneous collection of small parts close to the trap .",
    "we allow a @xmath47 uncertainty of @xmath79  to allow for an undetected 1 nt pmd at the hg door . in the case of the ucn door",
    "we have better diagnostics .",
    "the trap used when taking edm data has a small cavity in the lower electrode , 4.0 cm deep and 6.8 cm in diameter , sealed from below by the door .",
    "a pmd in the door mechanism can contribute a @xmath74 field to the cavity and to the rest of the trap .",
    "the field in the cavity contributes a strong shift in @xmath49 , while contributing negligibly via the gp to @xmath73 due to the small cavity radius . as a result ,",
    "the lines of 2 are shifted in opposite directions , again adding a systematic error to @xmath47 .",
    "our additional diagnostics came from separate @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath49 measurements ( without @xmath31 fields ) in two auxiliary traps having roofs that could be raised or lowered to change the height @xmath80 .",
    "the traps were built on the same lower electrode and door mechanism that were used for edm data taking .",
    "assuming @xmath81 , one can show that @xmath78 = 0 for a trap height @xmath80 when @xmath37 is the same for roof settings at @xmath82 and @xmath80 .",
    "with such a field established , @xmath48 was measured for several heights @xmath80 .",
    "the resulting forms of @xmath83 for  up and  down led to the conclusion that there was a dipole field of strength @xmath84 nt penetrating into the door cavity .",
    "they also confirmed the presence of quadrupole fields , which the fluxgate scans showed vary little with @xmath80 .",
    "polarization data from the edm runs further substantiated this : ucns of different energies have different @xmath57s , so the surviving ucn polarization decreases in proportion to @xmath85 , and the values of @xmath48 where the @xmath86 up and down polarizations peak are in excellent agreement with the auxiliary trap results .",
    "the first auxiliary trap used had a smaller radius , 18.5 cm rather than 23.5 cm , and a cavity depth of 6.0 rather than 4.0 cm .",
    "these differences amplify the @xmath49 shifts from a dipole field in the cavity by 1.50 and reduce the quadrupole shifts by a factor 1/1.8 .",
    "our systematic error correction to @xmath47 to allow for the combined door dipole and quadrupole fields is @xmath87 .",
    "the auxiliary trap used to measure @xmath57 by obtaining @xmath49 as a ( linear ) function of a series of known @xmath78 was made as similar to the data - taking trap as possible in dimensions and materials so as to reproduce the same ucn velocity spectrum .",
    ".summary of systematic errors and their uncertainties , in units of 10@xmath88 cm .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we now consider the systematic errors not involving gp .",
    "if the ucn have a net translational motion , any perpendicular component of the @xmath90 field will be seen in their rest frame as a combination of @xmath90 and @xmath91 fields . during the 130 s ramsey measurement period ,",
    "the ucn ensemble may warm slightly due to vibrations .",
    "this causes the center of mass to rise by up to 0.1 cm . if the volume - averaged angles between @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are each as high as 0.05 radians , the induced false edm will be @xmath93 .    in a similar manner to the translational effect ,",
    "any net rotational flow of the ucn in conjunction with a radial component of the @xmath90 field may lead to an induced edm signal .",
    "however , any such flow of ucn is expected to be attenuated by wall collisions before the first ramsey pulse is applied .",
    "we calculate that the maximum error to be expected from this source and from higher - order @xmath94 effects is below @xmath95 .",
    "analysis of the data suggested a possible small correlation between the intensity of the hg reading light and the value of the applied @xmath90 field . through the light shift , this could directly create an edm signal .",
    "however , to within its uncertainty , the dependence of @xmath49 on the light intensity has been removed .",
    "the residual systematic uncertainty from this source is @xmath96 .",
    "there may also be residual effects from @xmath91 field fluctuations .",
    "for example , a dipole - like field @xmath97 originating from the @xmath10-metal in the region of the hv feedthrough would be sensed by both neutrons and hg , but with a difference given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 cm is the distance from the source of the field to the center of the bottle .",
    "thus , fluctuations in @xmath91 that are correlated with the hv can be expected to be compensated up to a factor of about 70 . in order to study this",
    ", the hg and neutron channels were analysed independently .",
    "the neutrons yielded an edm signal of @xmath100 ; the hg , once the gp contribution ( as calculated from the average @xmath101 at which the data were taken ) was subtracted , yielded @xmath102 .",
    "these results are consistent with a common source of magnetic fluctuations correlated with the hv .",
    "we therefore expect the hg compensation to shield us from this systematic effect to a level of @xmath103 .",
    "another possible source of systematic error arises from electrostatic forces , which may move the electrodes slightly . in conjunction with a magnetic field gradient , an hv - dependent shift in the ratio would then appear .",
    "this was sought by looking for an edm - like signal but with a frequency shift proportional to @xmath104 instead of @xmath90 .",
    "the @xmath104 signal was consistent with zero , with an uncertainty of @xmath105 .",
    "if the hv magnitudes were slightly different for the two signs of @xmath90 , this effect would generate a false edm signal .",
    "study of the measured hv and of the charging currents show that the hv magnitude was the same for both polarities to within about 1% .",
    "this systematic uncertainty is therefore @xmath106 .",
    "analysis of the edm as a function of leakage current shows no measurable effect .",
    "leakage currents are typically of order 1 na .",
    "if this current were to travel 10 cm azimuthally around the bottle , the resultant @xmath91 field would result in an apparent edm of @xmath107 .",
    "ac fields are another possible cause of concern .",
    "there is no differential ripple visible on the hv at the level of a few volts .",
    "sampling is done at 5 hz with a bandwidth of 20 khz , so any 50 hz ripple would show up as beats .",
    "this is certainly absent at the level of 50 v , which would give a false edm of @xmath108 .",
    "low - frequency ac fields were sought by means of a pickup coil in conjunction with a phase - sensitive detector .",
    "shifts in @xmath49 from this source at the level of 0.02 ppm could not be ruled out .",
    "cancellations in the corresponding edm signal from reversals of the electric and magnetic fields would reduce any net contribution to below the level of @xmath108 .",
    "two approaches were adopted in studying the data . in the first ,",
    "more straightforward , analysis , only the 293 runs with an uncertainty on @xmath49 of less than 0.05 and with -10 ppm @xmath109 21 ppm were accepted . as the two resulting average @xmath101 values ( 8.948 , 8.943 ppm for  up , down respectively ) were almost identical , with approximately equal amounts of data in each field direction , a simple weighted average of the @xmath29 data was used as an estimator of @xmath35 .",
    "the value obtained was @xmath110 with an additional uniformly distributed systematic uncertainty of @xmath111  allocated to it in order to accommodate any potential systematic biases arising from the effects listed in table 1 .",
    "the resulting distribution of possible values implies an upper limit of @xmath112  ( 90% cl ) .",
    "the second analysis began with the [ fig : edm_vs_r ] fitted - lines crossing - point value @xmath113  ( which includes the run - by - run light shift correction ) and then applied the systematic - error corrections given in table 1 . the final result from this approach is @xmath114 in this analysis , the systematic uncertainty is normally distributed .",
    "the result implies an upper limit of @xmath115  ( 90% cl ) .",
    "the data set analysed here , which excludes data that have already been published @xcite , incorporates all neutron edm measurements undertaken between the autumn of 1998 and the end of 2002 .",
    "the results overall may be interpreted as an upper limit on the absolute value of the neutron edm of  ( 90% cl ) .",
