    "the peregrine solution ( ps ) , which was discovered more than 30 years ago @xcite , is one of the soliton solutions of the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation existing on top of a finite continuous - wave ( cw ) background .",
    "recently , the ps has drawn renewed attention due to its unique localization dynamics @xcite . particularly , it has been extensively studied as a prototype of the oceanic rogue waves , and is called , in this context , the peregrine rogue wave . actually , the ps is a limit case of other nls solitons existing on the finite background , _",
    "viz_. , the kuznetsov - ma soliton , localized in the transverse dimension kuznetsov , ma , and of the akhmediev breather , which is localized in the longitudinal dimension @xcite .",
    "it was found that a small perturbation on top of the cw background may grow into the full peregrine rogue wave , pumped by the modulation ( benjamin - feir )  instability of the background @xcite .",
    "experimental observations concerning the formation and dynamics of the peregrine rogue wave in diverse physical media , such as optical fibers , water - wave tanks , and plasmas , have been recently reported @xcite .",
    "splitting of the peregrine rogue wave under non - ideal initial conditions , which exhibits its instability , has been demonstrated too @xcite .",
    "another species of solutions of equations of the nls type is represented by breathers ( _ breathing solitons _ ) , which periodically oscillate in the course of the evolution .",
    "a well - known example is the dispersion - managed soliton , in which the periodic dilatation and compression is induced by the alternating map of the anomalous and normal group velocity dispersion smith , nakazawa , yu , shapiro , book , dm - review .",
    "generally , breathers exist in systems with periodically modulated parameters , such as dispersion , gain / loss and nonlinearity coefficients , which can be used for amplification and compression of solitons @xcite .",
    "the concept of breathing solitons is also known in the theory of nonlinear dissipative systems governed by generic complex ginzburg - landau equations , in which self - sustained breathers are supported by the balance between the dispersion and nonlinearity , concomitant with equilibrium between gain and loss .",
    "well - known examples of such dissipative breathers are provided , chiefly , by laser cavities and similarly organized systems featuring the combination of amplification and dissipation petv , physicad , deissler , lasers , tlidi , akhmediev1,ak , rosanov , vladimir , song .",
    "breathers are known too in models of nonlocal nonlinear media bezuhanov , zhanghuafeng , strinic , aleksic , petrovic .",
    "furthermore , breather - type solitons have been predicted in a variety of other physically relevant settings , including , _",
    "inter alia _ , discrete @xcite and continuous @xcite models of bose - einstein condensates , third - harmonic generation in nonlinear optics @xcite , reaction - diffusion systems @xcite , elastic rods with the mechanical nonlinearity represented by a combination of quadratic and cubic terms @xcite , and dynamical models of galaxies @xcite .",
    "in this work , using the spectral - filtering method , we aim to study the generation and propagation of breather - like solitons generated by the peregrine rogue waves in optical fibers with anomalous dispersion , kerr nonlinearity and high - order effects .",
    "the results help to understand unique properties of the peregrine rogue waves and design experimental generation of the breathers in optical fibers . in this connection",
    ", it may be relevant to mention recent works which demonstrated the generation of multiple solitons , both freely moving ones and arrays in the form of the newton s cradle @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , as a result of splitting of a high - order nls breather under the action of the third - order dispersion , and emission of solitons by airy waves in the nonlinear fiber @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we recapitulate the peregrine solution of the nls equation",
    ". then we present a rational fraction pulse , and discuss its propagation properties that are similar to those of breathers . in sec .",
    "iii , we investigate the generation , propagation , and stability of such oscillating solitons in the nonlinear fiber .",
    "conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "in the picosecond regime , the dynamics of the optical pulse propagation in optical fibers is governed by the scaled nls equation in the well - known form @xcite , @xmath0where @xmath1 is the slowly varying envelope of the electric field , @xmath2 , @xmath3 stands for the group velocity , while @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent the retarded temporal coordinate and normalized propagation distance , respectively .",
    "the rational ps of the nls equation is peregrine @xmath6 ,   \\label{peregrine}\\]]with@xmath7and @xmath8 , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are arbitrary real constants .",
    "equation ( [ peregrine ] ) demonstrates that the ps is a superposition of a cw solution and a fraction function , in which the nonzero cw background pushes an initial local weak pulse  towards nonlinear compression via the modulation instability .",
    "the largest compression of the pulse is attained at @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) @xcite , as shown in figs .",
    "fig1(a ) and [ fig1](c ) . as a possible application ,",
    "the maximally compressed pulse can be used to generate high - power pulses , with the help of the spectral - filtering technique @xcite .",
    "this method allows one to eliminate the cw background around the maximally compressed pulse in the temporal domain , therefore the shape of the high - power pulses , obtained by means of the spectral filtering , is chiefly determined by the fraction part of solution ( [ peregrine ] ) .    ) and ( b ) the rogue wave with zero cw background given by eq .",
    "( [ newperegrine ] ) .",
    "the growing intensity distributions at propagation distances @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , respectively , are shown in ( c ) for the peregrine rogue wave , and in ( d ) for the rogue wave with zero cw background . the parameters are @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21.,width=321 ]    now we turn to the consideration of the rational fraction part of solution ( [ peregrine ] ) , taking it as @xmath22this expression is _ not _ an exact solution for the nls equation , but it is localized in time and the propagation direction , and is surrounded by zero background , as seen in fig .

    "[ fig1](d ) with fig .",

    "figure [ fig2 ] shows their evolution along @xmath5 ( recall that @xmath9 ) . from here",
    ", one can see that , at @xmath24 , the peak power and energy of the fraction pulse increases with the propagation distance @xmath5 .",

    "according to the standard soliton theory , any input pulse tends to eventually transform into a fundamental soliton if the soliton number falls into the interval of @xmath32 .",
    "the breather wave form appears at @xmath33 . for the fraction pulse given by eq .",
    "( [ newperegrine ] ) , it follows from expression ( [ pwe ] ) that its energy is @xmath34p(z)w(z)$ ] .",
