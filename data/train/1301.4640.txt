    "many phylogenetic trees published in the literature or included in phylogenetic databases are actually alternative phylogenies for the same sets of organisms , obtained from different datasets or using different evolutionary models or different phylogenetic reconstruction algorithms @xcite .",
    "this variety of phylogenetic trees makes it necessary to develop methods for measuring their differences ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  30 ) .",
    "the comparison of phylogenetic trees is also used to compare phylogenetic trees obtained through numerical algorithms with other types of hierarchical classifications @xcite , to assess the stability of reconstruction methods @xcite , and in the comparative analysis of dendrograms and other hierarchical cluster structures  @xcite . hence , and since the safest way to quantify the differences between a pair of trees is through a metric , `` tree comparison metrics are an important tool in the study of evolution '' @xcite .",
    "many metrics for the comparison of phylogenetic trees have been proposed so far ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  30 ) .",
    "some of these metrics are edit distances that count how many operations of a given type are necessary to transform one tree into the other .",
    "these metrics include the nearest - neighbor interchange metric  @xcite and the subtree prune - and - regrafting distance  @xcite .",
    "other metrics compare a pair of phylogenetic trees through some consensus subtree .",
    "this is the case for instance of the mast distances defined in @xcite . finally , many metrics for phylogenetic trees are based on the comparison of encodings of the phylogenetic trees , like for instance the robinson - foulds metric  @xcite ( which can also be understood as an edit distance ) , the triples metric @xcite , the classical nodal metrics for binary phylogenetic trees @xcite , and the splitted nodal metrics for arbitrary phylogenetic trees @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this last kind of metrics is that , unlike the edit and the consensus distances , they are usually computed in low polynomial time .    in an already fifty years old paper @xcite ,",
    "sokal and rohlf proposed a technique to compare dendrograms ( which , in their paper , were equivalent to weighted phylogenetic trees without nested taxa ) on the same set of taxa , by encoding them by means of their half - matrices of cophenetic values , and then comparing these structures .",
    "their method runs as follows . to begin with",
    ", they divide the range of depths of internal nodes in the tree into a suitable number of equal intervals and number increasingly these intervals .",
    "then , for each pair of taxa @xmath11 in the tree , they compute their _ cophenetic value _ as the class mark of the interval where the depth of their lowest common ancestor lies .",
    "then , to compare two phylogenetic trees , they compare their corresponding half - matrices of cophenetic values . in that paper , they do it specifically by calculating a correlation coefficient between their entries .",
    "sokal and rohlf s paper @xcite is quite cited ( 612 cites according to google scholar on july 1 , 2012 ) and their method has been often used to compare hierarchical classifications ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .    since sokal and rohlf s paper ,",
    "other papers have compared the half - matrices of cophenetic values to define dissimilarity measures between phylogenetic trees ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , and such half - matrices have also been used in the so - called `` comparative method '' , the statistical methods used to make inferences on the evolution of a trait among species from the distribution of other traits : see @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  25 ) .",
    "but , to our knowledge , no proper metric for phylogenetic trees based on cophenetic values has been formally defined and studied in the literature . in this paper",
    "we define a new family of metrics for weighted phylogenetic trees with nested taxa based on sokal and rohlf s idea and we study some of their basic properties : neighbors , diameter , distribution , and their rank correlation with each other and with other metrics .",
    "our approach differs in some minors points with sokal and rohlf s .",
    "for instance , we use as the cophenetic value @xmath12 of a pair of taxa @xmath11 the actual depth of the lowest common ancestor of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , instead of class marks , which was done by sokal and rohlf because of practical limitations .",
    "moreover , instead of using a correlation coefficient , we define metrics by using @xmath3 norms . finally , we do not restrict ourselves to dendrograms , without internal labeled nodes , but we also allow nested taxa .",
    "there is , however , a main difference between our approach and sokal and rohlf s .",
    "we do not only consider the cophenetic values of pairs of taxa , but also the depths of the taxa .",
    "we must do so because we want to define a metric , where zero distance means isomorphism , and the cophenetic values of pairs of different taxa alone do not single out even the dendrograms considered by sokal and rohlf .",
    "that is , two non isomorphic weighted phylogenetic trees without nested taxa on the same set of taxa can have the same vectors of cophenetic values ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : nonuniq ] .",
    "it turns out that the _ cophenetic vector _ consisting of all cophenetic values of pairs of taxa and the depths of all taxa characterizes a weighted phylogenetic tree with nested taxa .",
    "this fact comes from the well known relationship between cophenetic values and patristic distances .",
    "if we denote by @xmath15 the depth of a taxon @xmath13 , by @xmath12 the cophenetic value of a pair of taxa @xmath11 and by @xmath16 the distance between @xmath13 and @xmath14 , then @xcite @xmath17 so , if the depths of the taxa are known , the knowledge of the cophenetic values of pairs of taxa is equivalent to the knowledge of the additive distance defined by the tree . on their turn , the depths and the additive distance single out the unrooted semi - labelled weighted tree associated to the phylogenetic tree with the former root labeled with a specific label `` root '' , and hence the phylogenetic tree itself : cf .",
    "theorem [ th : char ] .",
    "the fact that cophenetic vectors single out weighted phylogenetic trees with nested taxa can also be deduced from their relationship with splitted path lengths @xcite .",
    "recall that the splitted path length @xmath18 is the distance from the lowest common ancestor of @xmath13 and @xmath14 to @xmath13 .",
    "it is known ( * ? ? ?",
    "10 ) that the matrix @xmath19 characterizes a weighted phylogenetic tree with nested taxa .",
    "since , obviously , @xmath20 the cophenetic vector uniquely determines the matrix of splitted path lengths , and hence the tree .",
    "the vector of cophenetic values of pairs of different taxa is also related to the notion of ultrametric @xcite . indeed ,",
    "notice that @xmath21 satisfies the three - point condition of ultrametrics : for every taxa @xmath22 , @xmath23 but @xmath21 is not an ultrametric , as @xmath24 .",
    "actually , @xmath25 can only be used to define an ultrametric precisely on ultrametric trees , where the depths of all leaves are the same , say @xmath26 . in this case , @xmath27 is the ultrametric defined by the tree . in particular ,",
    "ultrametric trees can be compared by comparing their vectors of cophenetic values of pairs of different taxa .",
    "a similar idea is used in @xcite to induce an average genetic distance between populations from the average coancestry coefficient .",
    "we would like to dedicate this paper to the memory of robert r. sokal , father of the field of numerical taxonomy and who passed away last april .",
    "his ideas permeate biostatistics and computational phylogenetics .",

    "the reasons why we allow unlabeled elementary roots are that our results are still valid for phylogenetic trees containing them , and that even if we forbid them , we would need in some proofs to use that theorem [ th : char ] below is true for phylogenetic trees containing them .",

    "<S> [ [ background ] ] background : + + + + + + + + + + +    phylogenetic tree comparison metrics are an important tool in the study of evolution , and hence the definition of such metrics is an interesting problem in phylogenetics . in a paper in taxon fifty years ago , sokal and rohlf proposed to measure quantitatively the difference between a pair of phylogenetic trees by first encoding them by means of their half - matrices of cophenetic values , and then comparing these matrices . </S>",
    "<S> this idea has been used several times since then to define dissimilarity measures between phylogenetic trees but , to our knowledge , no proper metric on weighted phylogenetic trees with nested taxa based on this idea has been formally defined and studied yet . actually , the cophenetic values of pairs of different taxa alone are not enough to single out phylogenetic trees with weighted arcs or nested taxa .    [ [ results ] ] results : + + + + + + + +    for every ( rooted ) phylogenetic tree @xmath0 , let its _ cophenetic vector _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 consist of all pairs of cophenetic values between pairs of taxa in @xmath0 and all depths of taxa in @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that these cophenetic vectors single out weighted phylogenetic trees with nested taxa . </S>",
    "<S> we then define a family of cophenetic metrics @xmath2 by comparing these cophenetic vectors by means of @xmath3 norms , and we study , either analytically or numerically , some of their basic properties : neighbors , diameter , distribution , and their rank correlation with each other and with other metrics .    [ [ conclusions ] ] conclusions : + + + + + + + + + + + +    the cophenetic metrics can be safely used on weighted phylogenetic trees with nested taxa and no restriction on degrees , and they can be computed in @xmath4 time , where @xmath5 stands for the number of taxa . </S>",
    "<S> the metrics @xmath6 and @xmath7 have positive skewed distributions , and they show a low rank correlation with the robinson - foulds metric and the nodal metrics , and a very high correlation with each other and with the splitted nodal metrics . </S>",
    "<S> the diameter of @xmath2 , for @xmath8 , is in @xmath9 , and thus for low @xmath10 they are more discriminative , having a wider range of values . </S>"
