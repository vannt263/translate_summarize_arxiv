    "a three - level cascade laser has received a considerable attention over the years in connection with the strong correlation between the modes of the generated radiation that leads to a substantial degree of nonclassical features @xcite .",
    "one of the various possible schemes , in this regard , is a correlated emission laser in which the atomic coherence is induced by initially preparing the atoms in the coherent superposition of the atomic energy levels between which a direct spontaneous transition is electric dipole forbidden ( description of the model can be found for instance in @xcite ) .",
    "this quantum system has been thoroughly studied elsewhere for different situations when the cavity is assumed to be initially in a vacuum state @xcite .",
    "it is observed in these works that a strong robust entangled light can be produced by manipulating the rate at which the atoms are injected into the cavity and the initially prepared coherence .",
    "in addition , the mean photon number was found to be higher where the degree of entanglement is larger @xcite .",
    "however , the assumption pertaining to no radiation initially in the cavity appears to pose a serious challenge when weighed solely from technical point of view since it is practically impossible to build a cavity entirely in the vacuum state .",
    "even if one is determined to do so , it requires a significant effort and resource to cool it at that level . undoubtedly , this recurs additional cost leaving the emerging technical difficulty aside .    to circumvent the prevailing predicament somehow",
    ", recently there are efforts in assuming the cavity to contain a coherent light with certain number of photons when the atoms are taken to be pumped externally with another coherent light @xcite .",
    "it was predicted that the coherent light increases the mean photon number and enhances the dependence of the entanglement on the phase fluctuations . at this juncture ,",
    "there is one outstanding issue to be addressed in relation to having three coherent lights ( coherent light with different frequency ) in the cavity at the same time .    from naive understanding of atom - radiation interaction",
    ", it would be reasonable to expect the atoms to respond to the coherent lights in the same manner .",
    "consequently , as long as there is a sufficient amount of resonant coherent light in the cavity , there is a good chance of initiating a two - step pumping process .",
    "this provides another root for inducing a coherent superposition between the lower and the upper energy levels that amounts to establishing a similar effect as the external coherent radiation . in light of this ,",
    "the general tendency of designating the observed result to the pumping radiation and the initial coherent radiation in the cavity seems to beg for a more serious indepth consideration than the mere inclusion of the coherent light as initial state in the characteristic function can warranty .",
    "one of the most realistic proposals to study the effect of the light in the cavity at the beginning on the generated radiation may be heating the cavity to certain particular temprature using ordinary light source and then inject the initially prepared atoms to it .",
    "this can be done by placing the cavity in a bath of ordinary light allowed to leak into it via the coupler mirrors and wait until thermal equilibrium is reached or put the light source in the cavity until a wall temprature of interest has reached and then turn it off prior to the injection of the atoms .",
    "the former scenario is the usual consideration of the thermal reservoir treated elsewhere @xcite . in this case",
    ", the thermal light is found to increase the mean photon number , but degrade the two - mode squeezing and entanglement .",
    "however , the analysis of the latter is yet to be addressed .    with this understanding , in this communication , the effect of the thermal light initially seeded in the cavity as in the second option on the statistical properties and quantum features of the cavity radiation is studied where the thermal light is conveniently represented by the chaotic state . although the coupling of the quantum system to the environment invariably disparages the entanglement and other quantum features , the effect of decoherence due to thermal light is not taken into consideration .",
    "nevertheless , the environment is assumed to be made of vacuum modes whose fluctuations would be included in the usual manner .",
    "since the approach followed is presumed to be adaptable for arbitrary reservoir with a minimum effort , the thermal light outside the cavity has not been given attention to deter the confusion .",
    "basically , the cavity constructed in an open space at room temprature and then placed in an experimental setup can be considered as the cavity that contains chaotic light .",
    "in addition to this , when it becomes practically impossible to pump out all radiation from the cavity , so that it would be in a vacuum state , the remnant light can also be treated as a chaotic light .",
    "whatever the case may be , studying the effect of light in the cavity before the injection of atoms is envisioned to be of a paramount importance in utilizing the generated radiation for particular purposes like teleportation and quantum information processing as anticipated .    to achieve the intended goal ,",
    "the procedure by which the chaotic light in a cavity can be integrated with the three - level atomic system would be formulated .",
    "to do so , the general characteristics of thermal light is outlined in the way that it can be salvaged for present work .",
    "then the equations of evolution for the three - level laser for an arbitrary initial radiation would be obtained where the contribution of the thermal light enters via this initial condition . in the process",
    ", it is assumed that the atoms are unable to distinguish among cavity radiations other than their frequency whereby the thermal light can also be absorbed by the atoms . in light of this , the effects of initially heating the cavity ( thermal seeding ) on the achievable two - mode squeezing , entanglement and mean photon number is investigated by making use of the correlation properties of the chaotic light .",
    "it is a well established fact that the radiation generated by conventional sources of light can be taken as the best example of chaotic light .",
    "for instance , the light produced by a laser machine operating below threshold exhibits chaotic nature .",
    "for the sake of convenience , let us consider the thermal light in a cavity maintained at equilibrium with the walls at temperature @xmath3 .",
    "the density operator @xmath4 for the thermal light can be related to the entropy by von neumann relation @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath7 stands for trace operation and @xmath4 is the density operator .    on the basis that at equilibrium entropy should be maximum and @xmath8 , the density operator for the chaotic light is related to the temprature by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the hamiltonian of the radiation field when the zero point energy is shifted by @xmath11 and @xmath12 for convenience .",
    "the same density operator can be described in the number state applying the completeness relation for number state @xmath13 and the orthonormality condition @xmath14 as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the mean photon number . since the chaotic light does not exhibit correlation , for two - mode light ,",
    "the density operator can be treated as separable ; @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the mean photon numbers corresponding to the respective modes",
    ".    on the other hand , the number state can be describable in terms of the vacuum state as @xmath19 which can also be expressed in terms of the coherent state using the power series expansion of the form @xmath20 as @xmath21    applying the density operator along with the relation of number state with coherent state and definition of the mean value @xmath22 , for any operator @xmath23 , it is possible to verify for two - mode chaotic light that @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26    if it is found necessary , the mean photon number of each mode can be related to the frequency of the corresponding mode and temprature of the wall by @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "a two - photon correlated emission laser can be interpreted as the amplification of simultaneously emitted photons with different frequency that are correlated due to the coherence superposition induced by preparing the atoms in the upper and lower energy levels denoted by @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively . in establishing the lasing mechanism ,",
    "the atoms are presumed to be injected with constant rate @xmath31 into the cavity and left after successfully decayed to other energy levels .    in general , interaction of a nondegenerate three - level cascade atom with a two - mode cavity radiation",
    "can be described in the rotating - wave approximation and the interaction picture by the hamiltonian of the form @xmath32,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the coupling constant taken to be the same for both transitions , @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) is the annihilation operator for one of the cavity radiations and @xmath36 is the intermediate energy level .",

    "the corresponding initial density operator would be @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the corresponding populations and @xmath43 represents the initial atomic coherence .    with this condition , applying the linear and adiabatic approximation schemes in the good cavity limit , the time evolution of the reduced density operator that accounts for the contribution of the cavity radiation due to the atoms is found to be @xcite @xmath44 \\notag\\\\&+ \\frac{a(1+\\eta)}{4}\\big[2\\hat{b}\\hat{\\rho}\\hat{b}^{\\dagger } -\\hat{b}^{\\dagger}\\hat{b}\\hat{\\rho } - \\hat{\\rho}\\hat{b}^{\\dagger}\\hat{b}\\big ] \\notag\\\\ & + \\frac{a\\sqrt{1-\\eta^{2}}}{4}\\big[\\hat{\\rho}\\hat{a}^{\\dagger}\\hat{b}^{\\dagger } -2\\hat{a}^{\\dagger}\\hat{\\rho}\\hat{b}^{\\dagger } + \\hat{a}^{\\dagger}\\hat{b}^{\\dagger}\\hat{\\rho}\\notag\\\\&- 2\\hat{b}\\hat{\\rho}\\hat{a } + \\hat{a}\\hat{b}\\hat{\\rho } + \\hat{\\rho}\\hat{a}\\hat{b}\\big],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the linear gain coefficient , @xmath46 is the population inversion and @xmath47 is the atomic decay rate .",
    "in order to study the dynamics of the cavity radiation of the combined system , it is necessary to obtain the associated equations of evolution . to this end",
    ", the contribution of the initial chaotic light in the cavity and the two - mode vacuum reservoir towards the master equation is sought for .",
    "it is a well established fact that the time evolution of the reduced density operator for the cavity radiation coupled to a reservoir has , in the born approximation @xcite , the form @xmath48 - i[\\langle\\hat{h}_{sr}(t)\\rangle_{r},\\ ; \\hat{\\rho}(0 ) ] \\notag\\\\&- \\int_{0}^{t}[\\langle\\hat{h}_{sr}(t)\\rangle_{r},\\ ; [ \\hat{h}_{s}(t ' ) , \\;\\hat{\\rho}(t')]]dt ' \\notag\\\\&- \\int_{0}^{t}tr_{r}[\\hat{h}_{sr}(t),\\ ; [ \\hat{h}_{sr}(t'),\\ ; \\hat{\\rho}(t')\\hat{r}]]dt',\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 and @xmath50 refer to the system and reservoir variables and @xmath51 represents the radiation initially in the cavity .",

    "it is also noteworthy that the first term and the part involving @xmath64 in the third term comes from the contribution of the coupling of the cavity with external vacuum modes ( reservoir ) and basically related to the thermal fluctuations . on account of this",
    ", it may not be difficult to observe that until the lasing system able to generate strong light , the effect of the thermal fluctuations dominates and later , undoubtedly , the effect of the lasing system begins to overtake it .",
    "the result obtained here , the two - mode squeezing would be maximum at steady state , corroborates with this line of reasoning .",

    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] that the degree of two - mode squeezing is significantly impaired by chaotic light , that is , the more intense the seeding , the more the squeezing is damaged .",

    "[ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] , [ fig4 ] and eq . that the degree of squeezing at large time scale is independent of the mean photon number of the chaotic light .",

    "since the number of chaotic light in the cavity can not increase , the absorption mechanism dwindles it over time .    at this juncture , it would be appropriate noting that the atoms are continuously injected with constant rate and left the cavity after decaying to any other energy level that does not involve in the lasing process .",
    "in connection to this , what most probably happens is an atom after absorbing a chaotic light emits a light which is not necessarily has the same nature as it absorbs .",

    "later due to the availability of large number of photons than the system can generate , the atoms begin to pickup these photons leisurely and underwent emissions to any other level that does not involve in the lasing mechanism .",

    "moreover , comparison of figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig9 ] reveals that @xmath131 attains minimum value ( better degree of entanglement ) quite earlier than when the intensity becomes strong .",

    "[ fig10 ] and [ fig11 ] that at the vicinity of @xmath0 , the entanglement of the cavity radiation when @xmath163 and @xmath164 exhibits different nature . by large , this result can be associated with the nature of the mean photon number in a similar case .",
    "even though the presence of thermal seed in mode @xmath2 somewhat diminishes the degree of entanglement , its effect would be more prominent when the thermal light is seeded in mode @xmath1 .",
    "critical comparison between figs .",
    "[ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] , for @xmath109 , indicates that the effect of the thermal light when it is in mode @xmath2 is quite nominal over time , but as clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] the effect would be large when @xmath114 is large specially at the beginning of the lasing process . in consonant with earlier observations ,",
    "the effect of the thermal seeding would be insignificant in the later time of the operation to change the achievable entanglement .    in order to see the relation between two - mode squeezing and entanglement , @xmath131 and @xmath110",

    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] that the nature of the evolution of the degree of entanglement and two - mode squeezing is basically similar , although observing entangled light when there is no squeezing at early stages of the process is possible .",
    "the resemblance as in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] remains appearing at larger time scale as predicted earlier at steady state @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that such a tendency of exhibiting similar behavior would break near @xmath115 , since the squeezing disappears at @xmath115 while the degree of entanglement is nearly close to 50% which is undoubtedly a significant difference .",
    "it is due to this disparity that the values of @xmath108 are taken to be different while investigating two - mode squeezing and entanglement .",
    "plots of the minimum of the logarithmic negativity ( @xmath131 ) and the minus quadrature variance ( @xmath110 ) for @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath109 , and @xmath114=0.5.,height=245 ]",
    "in this contribution , detailed analysis of the time evolution of the cavity radiation of the two - photon correlated emission laser when the cavity is initially maintained at a particular temprature is presented .",
    "the effect of the seed thermal light is included via the parameters that describe the initial conditions in the solution of the corresponding stochastic differential equations . with the understanding that the effect of the thermal light enters as initial conditions only if the source is entirely shut off prior to the injection of the atoms , the characteristic correlations of the chaotic light are employed in the process of determining various quantities of interest .",
    "it turns out that the thermal light significantly damages the nonclassical features like two - mode squeezing and entanglement at earlier stages of the lasing process .",
    "although the degree of entanglement and two - mode squeezing exhibit more or less a similar dependence on the intensity of the thermal light and time , their nature comes out to be different when the thermal light is seeded only in one of the modes specially at the vicinity of @xmath0 .",
    "fundamentally , the degree of two - mode squeezing is almost independent of which mode is initially seeded , but the degree of entanglement reduces considerably when the light with the same strength is seeded in mode @xmath1 .",
    "quite remarkably , a somewhat similar characteristic is perceived for the mean photon number . when viewed over a longer time span , the mean photon number has a peak when mode @xmath2 is seeded , but a dip when mode @xmath1 is seeded .",
    "the time for which one observes the peak is relatively much greater than the corresponding time for the dip .",
    "it is found that this disparity in the tendency of the mean photon number increases with the intensity of the seed .",
    "moreover , it is unambiguousely shown that at longer time scale , the two - mode squeezing , entanglement and intensity of the radiation are independent of the strength of the initial thermal light .",
    "this by large is related to the presumption that the atoms can absorb any light in the cavity as long as it is resonant . in view of this",
    ", it would be an obvious matter to realize that the effect of the thermal light is sucked from the cavity in a level that it would not affect the nonclassical features of the radiation .",
    "as long as the radiation in the cavity is resonant with the radiative levels of the atoms , it is not difficult to infer that this outcome remains valid irrespective of the type of the seed .",
    "this entails that while designing the experimental setup , one should not be compelled by the remnant radiation in the cavity , since its effect would be significantly nominal at longer time scales .",
    "it is hoped that such an outcome can provide another dimension to the practical utilization of the various schemes of the three - level laser as a source of bright entangled light .",
