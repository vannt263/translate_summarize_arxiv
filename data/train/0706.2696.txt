    "magnetic fields in molecular clouds play an important role in the early stages of star formation . they may regulate the cloud fragmentation process , moderate the infall motions on to density peaks , control angular momentum evolution through magnetic braking , launch jets from the near - protostellar environment , and possibly determine a finite mass reservoir for star formation by limiting accretion from a magnetically - dominated envelope .",
    "the prevailing macroturbulence in molecular cloud envelopes also likely represents magnetohydrodynamic motions .",
    "this paper concerns itself with the first two issues above : we employ the first fully three - dimensional simulation to study the role of magnetic fields _ and _ ion - neutral friction in regulating gravitationally - driven fragmentation and infall .",
    "the relative strengths of gravity and the magnetic field can be quantified through the mass - to - flux ratio @xmath4 .",
    "there exists a critical mass - to - flux ratio @xmath5 @xcite such that if @xmath6 , a pressure - bounded cloud is supercritical and is prone to indefinite collapse if the external pressure exceeds some value .",
    "this behaviour is analogous to that of the nonmagnetic bonnor - ebert sphere .",
    "conversely , if @xmath7 , a cloud is subcritical and can not collapse even in the limit of infinite external pressure , as long as magnetic flux - freezing applies .",
    "a similar condition @xmath8 is required for unconditional stability of an infinite uniform ( in @xmath9 ) layer that is flattened along the @xmath10-direction of a background magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the various numerical values of @xmath5 differ by small factors of order unity , and we adopt the result of @xcite since their model closely resembles the initial state in our calculation .    magnetic field strength measurements through the zeeman effect",
    "reveal that the mass - to - flux ratios are clustered about the critical value for collapse @xcite and that there is also an approximate equipartition between the absolute values of gravitational energy and nonthermal ( hereafter , `` turbulent '' ) energy @xcite .",
    "measurements of polarized emission from dust grains , which reveal the field morphology , generally indicate that the field in cloud cores is well ordered and not dominated by turbulent motions , with application of the chandrasekhar - fermi method yielding mass - to - flux ratios near the critical value @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that even if clouds are magnetically supported , ambipolar diffusion ( resulting from ion - neutral slip ) will cause the support to be lost and stars to form .",
    "more specifically , a medium with a subcritical mass - to - flux ratio will still undergo a gravitationally - driven instability , occurring on the ambipolar diffusion time scale rather than the dynamical time scale @xcite .",
    "the length scale of the instability is essentially the jeans scale in the limit of highly subcritical clouds ( the same length scale as for highly supercritical fragmentation ) but can be much larger when the mass - to - flux ratio is close to the critical value @xcite .",
    "most nonlinear calculations of ambipolar diffusion driven evolution have focused on a single axisymmetric core , but newer models focus on a fragmentation process that results in the formation of multiple cores and somewhat irregular density and velocity structure .",
    "@xcite carried out a two - dimensional simulation of an infinitesimally - thin sheet threaded by an initially perpendicular magnetic field . starting with slightly subcritical initial conditions",
    ", they followed the initial growth of mildly elongated fragments which occurred on a time scale intermediate between the dynamical time associated with supercritical collapse and the ambipolar diffusion time - scale associated with highly subcritical clouds .",
    "@xcite carried out two - dimensional simulations of a magnetized sheet in the thin - disc approximation , which incorporates a finite disc half - thickness @xmath11 consistent with hydrostatic equilibrium and thereby includes the effect of magnetic pressure .",
    "they studied a model which had an initially critical mass - to - flux ratio and another which was supercritical by a factor of two .",
    "one of their main results was that the critical model had subsonic ( maximum speed @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the isothermal sound speed ) infall , while the decidedly supercritical cloud had infall speeds @xmath14 on scales @xmath15 pc from the core centres .",
    "this is a significant observationally - testable difference between dynamical ( supercritical ) fragmentation and ambipolar - diffusion regulated ( critical or subcritical ) fragmentation .",
    "yet another mode of fragmentation is the so - called turbulent fragmentation , which in fact corresponds to collapse driven by a strong external compression . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have studied this process for a magnetized sheet using the thin - disc approximation , and including the effect of ion - neutral friction .",
    "they find that a mildly subcritical cloud can undergo locally rapid ambipolar diffusion and form multiple fragments because of an initial large - scale highly supersonic compression wave .",
    "the core formation occurs on a crossing time of the simulation box , which is related to the dynamical time .",
    "@xcite estimate that such a process can simultaneously maintain a relatively low efficiency of star formation , as is required by observations @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the three - dimensional extension of models such as those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the self - consistent calculation of the vertical structure of the cloud allows us to test the predictions of two - dimensional models as well as to make some new predictions .",
    "we model clouds that are either decidedly supercritical or subcritical and study the evolution after the introduction of small - amplitude perturbations . the case of compression - induced collapse",
    "will be studied in a separate paper .",
    "we note that our three - dimensional model is not a cubic region but rather a flattened three - dimensional layer that is consistent with the expected settling of gas along the direction of the magnetic field . in reality",
    ", we believe that our modeled region would represent the dense midplane of a larger more turbulent cloud .",
    "as demonstrated by the one - dimensional models of @xcite , the turbulent motions in a stratified magnetized cloud develop the largest amplitude motions in the outer low - density envelope , while maintaining transonic or subsonic motions near the midplane .",
    "we believe that the fragmentation process as modeled in this paper may proceed while long - lived turbulent motions continue on larger scales .",
    "we solve the three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations including self - gravity and ambipolar diffusion , assuming that neutrals are much more numerous than ions :    @xmath16    @xmath17    @xmath18 , \\label{eq : induction}\\ ] ]    @xmath19    @xmath20    @xmath21    where @xmath1 is the density of neutral gas , @xmath22 is the pressure , @xmath23 is the velocity , @xmath2 is the magnetic field , @xmath24 is the electric current density , @xmath25 is the self - gravitating potential , and @xmath26 is the sound speed . instead of solving a detailed energy equation , we assume isothermality for each lagrangian fluid particle @xcite : @xmath27 for the neutral - ion collision time in equation ( [ eq : induction ] ) and associated quantities , we follow @xcite , so that @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the density of ions and @xmath30 is the average collisional rate between ions of mass @xmath31 and neutrals of mass @xmath32 . here , we use typical values of hco@xmath33-h@xmath34 collisions , for which @xmath35 @xmath36s@xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we also assume that the ion density @xmath29 is determined by the approximate relation @xcite @xmath39 where we assume @xmath40@xmath36 and @xmath41 throughout this paper .      as an initial condition",
    ", we assume hydrostatic equilibrium of a self - gravitating one - dimensional cloud along @xmath10-direction @xcite .",
    "the hydrostatic equilibrium is calculated from equations    @xmath42    @xmath43    @xmath44    subject to the boundary conditions @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the initial density and sound speed at @xmath48 .",
    "if the initial sound speed ( temperature ) is uniform throughout the region , we have the following analytic solution @xmath49 found by @xcite : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the scale height",
    ". however , an isothermal molecular cloud is usually surrounded by warm material , such as neutral hydrogen gas .",
    "hence , we assume the initial sound speed distribution to be @xmath52\\ ] ] where we take @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 throughout the paper . by using this sound speed distribution",
    ", we can solve equations ( [ eq : hsp])-([eq : hss ] ) numerically .",
    "the initial density distribution of the numerical solution shows that it is almost the same as spitzer s solution for @xmath56 .",
    "we also assume that the initial magnetic field is uniform along the @xmath10-direction : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is constant .",
    "in this equilibrium sheet - like gas , we input a random velocity perturbation @xcite at each grid point : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a random number chosen uniformly from the range [ -1,1 ] .",
    "the @xmath60 s for each of @xmath61 and @xmath62 are independent realizations .",
    "however , each model presented in this paper uses the same pair of realizations of @xmath60 for generating the initial perturbations .",
    "a set of fundamental units for this problem are @xmath47 , @xmath63 , and @xmath46 .",
    "these yield a time unit @xmath64 .",
    "the initial magnetic field strength introduces one dimensionless free parameter , @xmath65 the ratio of gas to magnetic pressure at @xmath48 .    in the sheet - like equilibrium cloud with a vertical magnetic field , @xmath66 is related to the mass - to - flux ratio for spitzer s self - gravitating cloud .",
    "the mass - to - flux ratio normalized to the critical value is @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the column density of spitzer s self - gravitating cloud .",
    "therefore , @xmath69 although the initial cloud we used is not exactly the same as the spitzer cloud , @xmath66 is a good indicator to whether or not the magnetic field can prevent gravitational instability @xcite .",
    "dimensional values of all quantities can be found through a choice of @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "for example , for @xmath70 km s@xmath37 and @xmath71 @xmath36 , we get @xmath72 pc , @xmath73 yr , and @xmath74 g if @xmath75 .      in order to solve the equations numerically",
    ", we use the cip method @xcite for equations ( [ eq : continuity ] ) , ( [ eq : momentum ] ) and ( [ eq : isothermal ] ) , and the method of characteristics - constrained transport ( mocct ; @xcite ) for equation ( [ eq : induction ] ) , including an explicit integration of the ambipolar diffusion term .",
    "the combination of the cip and mocct methods is summarized in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it includes the ccup method @xcite for the calculation of gas pressure , in order to get more numerically stable results .",
    "the numerical code in this paper is based on that of @xcite .    in this paper , the ambipolar diffusion term is only included when the density is greater than a certain value , @xmath76 .",
    "we let @xmath77 both for numerical convenience and due to the physical idea that the low density region is affected by external ultraviolet radiation so that the ionization fraction becomes large , i.e. @xmath78 becomes small @xcite . under this assumption , the upper atmosphere of the sheet - like cloud",
    "is not affected by ambipolar diffusion .",
    "this simple assumption helps to avoid very small time - steps due to the low density region in order to maintain stability of the explicit numerical scheme .",
    "we used a mirror - symmetric boundary condition at @xmath48 and periodic boundaries in the @xmath79 and @xmath80-directions . at the upper boundary at @xmath81",
    ", we also used a mirror - symmetric boundary except when we solve the gravitational potential .",
    "this symmetric condition is just for numerical convenience .",
    "however , because the results we show later in this paper are consistent with previous two - dimensional simulations , we believe that the boundary conditions do not affect the result significantly .",
    "the poisson equation ( [ eq : poisson ] ) is solved by the greens function method to compute the gravitational kernels in @xmath10-direction , along with a fourier transform method in the @xmath79 and @xmath80-directions @xcite .",
    "this method of solving the poisson equation allows us to find the gravitational potential of a vertically isolated cloud within @xmath82 .",
    "the computational region is @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the number of grid points for each direction is @xmath85 .",
    "since the most unstable wavelength for no magnetic field is about @xmath86 @xcite , we have 16 grid points within this wavelength .",
    "we have also 10 grid points within the scale height of the initial cloud in the @xmath10-direction .",
    "while this is not a high - resolution simulation , we believe that we have the minimum number of grid points to study the gravitational instability , especially by using the code based on cip @xcite .",
    "the maximum computational time , which occurs for the case of the subcritical cloud , is about 85 hours of cpu time using a single processor of the vpp5000 in the national astronomical observatory of japan .",
    "figure 1 shows the time evolution of the density at the location where the density reaches its maximum value in each simulation .",
    "the simulations are stopped when the maximum density is about @xmath87 .",
    "each line shows a case of different @xmath66 .",
    "when @xmath66 is 100 or 4 , the magnetic field is not strong enough to suppress the self - gravitational instability of the cloud . in these cases",
    ", the density evolves rapidly , over the sound - crossing time of the most unstable wavelength ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "however , when @xmath89 , the cloud is self - gravitationally stable unless ion - neutral slip is present .",
    "therefore , the density evolves gradually over the diffusion time of the magnetic field . according to the two - dimensional linear analysis by @xcite , the evolutionary time scale of a significantly subcritical cloud is about ten times longer than the dynamical time , for a standard ionization fraction , as used here .",
    "our numerical result is consistent with their analysis .",
    "figure 2 , figure 3 , and figure 4 show the logarithmic density contours for @xmath89 at @xmath90 , @xmath91 at @xmath92 , and @xmath93 at @xmath94 respectively .",
    "each upper panel shows the cross section at @xmath48 , and the lower panel shows the cross section at @xmath95 for @xmath89 , @xmath96 for @xmath91 , and @xmath96 for @xmath93 respectively .",
    "the values of @xmath80 for the lower panels are chosen so that the vertical cut passes through at least one dense core .",
    "( in these numerical simulations , we use the term `` core '' to refer to the region where the density is greater than the mean background density by about a factor of 3 . )",
    "the size of cores for @xmath91 is bigger than that of @xmath93 .",
    "the size becomes smaller again when the magnetic field is stronger than critical ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "this result is consistent with the two - dimensional linear analysis of @xcite , who found a hybrid mode for critical or mildly supercritical clouds in which the combined effect of field - line dragging and magnetic restoring forces enforce a larger than usual fragmentation scale",
    ". arrows show velocity vectors on each cross section .",
    "maximum velocities become supersonic for @xmath91 and @xmath93 , but remain subsonic for @xmath89 .",
    "this is also consistent with the two - dimensional numerical simulations of @xcite .",
    "figure 5 and figure 6 shows the close up views of the density contours around cores for @xmath89 and @xmath91 respectively .",
    "magnetic field lines near cores are also plotted in three - dimensional space . when @xmath89 , the neutral gas has to slip through the field lines to make a gravitationally bound core .",
    "therefore , the field lines are not so deformed in the case of @xmath89 , in contrast to those of @xmath91 .",
    "figure 7 and figure 8 show the logarithmic contours of plasma @xmath97 for @xmath89 at @xmath90 and @xmath91 at @xmath92 , respectively . when @xmath89 , the plasma @xmath97 in cores is _",
    "greater than in the surroundings_. this is because the mass - to - flux ratio ( and therefore @xmath97 ) has to increase in order for the core to become gravitationally unstable .",
    "the maximum @xmath97 is larger than 1 at the centre of a core , which means that the centre of the core is approximately supercritical .",
    "in contrast to this , the plasma @xmath97 in cores is _ slightly lower than the surroundings _ when @xmath91 . in this case , the magnetic field",
    "is swept up by the contracting cloud before ion - neutral slip works efficiently .",
    "if hydrostatic equilibrium along the @xmath10-direction is exactly satisfied , the plasma @xmath97 would remain constant in time and space .",
    "the slightly lower values of @xmath97 in cores are probably caused by the modestly nonequilibrium state along @xmath10 during the evolution .",
    "figure 9 shows the densities , plasma @xmath97 , and @xmath61 along @xmath79-axes for lines that cut through the cores shown in figure 5 and figure 6 .",
    "the left panel shows the core for @xmath89 .",
    "the right panel shows the core for @xmath91 .",
    "figure 9 shows that the plasma @xmath97 in the core is higher than the surroundings for @xmath89 and lower for @xmath91 . the infall velocity for @xmath91 shows supersonic values , while the velocity for @xmath89 is subsonic .",
    "these velocities are comparable to those in figure 2 and figure 3 of @xcite .",
    "figure 10 shows the densities , plasma @xmath97 , and @xmath98 along @xmath10-axes for lines that cut through the same cores .",
    "it also shows that the infall velocity for @xmath91 reaches mildly supersonic values , while the velocity for @xmath89 is subsonic .",
    "figure 11 shows the relation between density and magnetic field on the plane @xmath48 .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field is normalized by @xmath99 .",
    "open circles show the magnetic field strength as a function of density along @xmath48 at @xmath90 for the model with @xmath89 ( see fig .",
    "filled circles are the same for @xmath91 , at @xmath92 ( see fig .",
    "the blue line shows the evolutionary track of the point at which the density achieves its maximum value for the model with @xmath89 .",
    "the red line is the same but for @xmath91 .",
    "this figure shows that _ the snapshot of the relation between density and magnetic field at different spatial points in the midplane of the cloud overlaps with the evolutionary track of an individual core _ .",
    "the dashed line shows @xmath3 .",
    "when the density becomes large , each relation approximately tends to @xmath3 . in the case of @xmath89",
    ", the relation shows that core initially evolves to greater density without increasing the magnetic field strength .",
    "this is caused by the slip of neutral gas through the magnetic field during the subcritical phase of evolution .",
    "we have studied fragmentation of a sheet - like self - gravitating cloud by three - dimensional mhd simulations .",
    "the main results are as follows .",
    "* we confirmed that in the case of an initially subcritical cloud ( @xmath89 ) , cores developed gradually over an ambipolar diffusion time , while the cores in an initially supercritical cloud ( @xmath91 or @xmath93 ) developed in a dynamical time . *",
    "the infall speed on to cores is subsonic in the case of an initially subcritical cloud , while there is extended supersonic infall in the case of an initially supercritical cloud .",

    "this result is consistent with the two - dimensional linear analysis of @xcite .",
    "* when the cloud is initially subcritical ( @xmath89 ) , the plasma @xmath97 in cores is greater than in the surroundings .",
    "in contrast to this , the plasma @xmath97 in cores is slightly lower than the surroundings when the cloud is initially supercritical ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "the latter result is probably caused by the modestly nonequilibrium state along @xmath10 during the evolution .",
    "* in the @xmath100 plane , the snapshot of the relation between magnetic field strength ( @xmath2 ) and density ( @xmath1 ) at different spatial points of the cloud overlaps with the evolutionary track of an individual core .",
    "when the density becomes large , each relation approximately tends to @xmath3 .",
    "our simulation is the first fully three - dimensional simulation to study the role of magnetic fields and ion - neutral friction in fragmentation . in this paper , we concentrated on the effect of initially small perturbations , partly as a way to compare with established predictions of linear theory .",
    "our models also serve as a guide to understand fragmentation occurring exclusively in dense subregions of clouds that contain only subsonic or transonic motions .",
