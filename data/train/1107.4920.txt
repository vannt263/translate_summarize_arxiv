    "tunneling is a supreme quantum effect .",
    "every introductory text@xcite on quantum mechanics gives the paradigm example of a particle tunneling through a one - dimensional potential barrier despite having a total energy less than the barrier height .",
    "indeed , the reader typically works through a number of excercises , all involving one - dimensional potential barriers of one form or another modelling several key physical phenomena ranging from atom transfer reactions to the decay of alpha particles@xcite . however , one seldom encounters coupled multidimenisonal tunneling in such texts since an analytical solution of the schrdinger equation in such cases is not possible .",
    "interestingly , the richness and complexity of the tunneling phenomenon manifest themselves in full glory in the case of multidimensional systems@xcite .",
    "thus , for instance , the usual one - dimensional expectation of increasing tunneling splittings as one approaches the barrier top from below is not necessarily true as soon as one couples another bound degree of freedom to the tunneling coordinate . in the context of molecular reaction dynamics ,",
    "multidimensional tunneling can result in strong mode - specificity and fluctuations in the reaction rates@xcite .",
    "in fact , a proper description of tunneling of electrons and hydrogen atoms is absolutely essential@xcite even in molecular systems as large as enzymes and proteins .",
    "although one usually assumes tunneling effects to be significant in molecules involving light atom transfers it is worth pointing out that neglecting the tunneling of even a heavy atom like carbon is the difference between a reaction occuring or not occuring . in particular",
    ", one can underestimate rates by nearly hundred orders of magnitude@xcite .",
    "interestingly , and perhaps paradoxically , several penetrating insights into the nature and mechanism of multidimensional barrier tunneling have been obtained from a phase space perspective@xcite .",
    "the contributions by creagh , shudo and ikeda , and takahashi in the present volume provide a detailed account of the latest advances in the phase space based understanding of multidimensional barrier tunneling .    what happens if there are no coordinate space barriers ?",
    "in other words , in situations wherein there are no static energetic barriers separating  reactants \" from the  products \" does one still have to be concerned about quantum tunneling ?",
    "one such model potential is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] which will be discussed in the next section .",
    "here we have the notion of reactants and products in a very general sense .",
    "so , for instance , in the context of a conformational reaction they might correspond to the several near - degenerate conformations of a specific molecule . naively one might expect that tunneling has no consequences in such cases .",
    "however , studies over last several decades@xcite have revealed that things are not so straightforward . despite the lack of static barriers ,",
    "the dynamics of the system can generate barriers and quantum tunneling can occur through such dynamical barriers@xcite .",
    "this , of course , immediately implies that dynamical tunneling is a very rich and subtle phenomenon since the nature and number of barriers can vary appreciably with changes in the nature of the dynamics over the timescales of interest .",
    "this would also seem to imply that deciphering the mechanism of dynamical tunneling is a hopeless task as opposed to the static potential barrier case wherein elegant approximations to the tunneling rate and splittings can be written down .",
    "however , recent studies have clearly established that even in the case of dynamical tunneling it is possible to obtain very accurate approximations to the splittings and rate . in particular , it is now clear that unambiguous identification of the local dynamical barriers is possible only by a detailed study of the structure of the underlying classical phase space .",
    "the general picture that has emerged is that dynamical tunneling connects two or more classically disconnected regions in the phase space . more importantly , and perhaps ironically , the dynamical tunneling splittings and rates are extremely sensitive to the various phase space structures like nonlinear resonances@xcite , chaos@xcite and partial barriers@xcite .",
    "it is crucial to note that although purely quantum approaches can be formulated for obtaining the tunneling splittings , any mechanistic understanding requires a detailed understanding of the phase space topology . in this sense",
    ", the phenomenon of dynamical tunneling gets intimately linked to issues related to phase space transport .",
    "thus , one now has the concept of resonance - assisted tunneling ( rat ) and chaos - assisted tunneling ( cat ) and realistic systems typically involve both the mechanisms .",
    "since the appearance of the first book@xcite on the topic of interest more than a decade ago , there have been several beautiful experimental studies@xcite that have revealed various aspects of the phenomenon of dynamical tunneling .",
    "the most recent one by chaudhury _",
    "_ realizes@xcite the paradigmatic kicked top model using cold @xmath0cs atoms and clearly demonstrate the dynamical tunneling occuring in the underlying phase space .",
    "interestingly , good correspondence between the quantum dynamics and classical phase space structures is found despite the system being in a deep quantum regime . as another example , i mention the experimental observation@xcite by flling _",
    "_ of second order co - tunneling of interacting ultracold rubidium atoms in a double well trap .",
    "the similarities between this system and the studies on dynamical tunneling using molecular effective hamiltonians is striking .",
    "in particular , the description of the cold atom study in terms of superexchange ( qualitative and quantitative ) is reminiscent of the early work by stuchebrukhov and marcus@xcite on understanding the role of dynamical tunneling in the phenomenon of intramolecular energy flow .",
    "further details on the experimental realizations can be found in this volume in the articles by steck and raizen , and hensinger .",
    "an earlier review@xcite provides extensive references to the experimental manifestations of dynamical tunneling in molecular systems in terms of spectroscopic signatures .",
    "undoubtedly , in the coming years , one can expect several other experimental studies which will lead to a deeper understanding of dynamical tunneling and raise many intriguing issues related to the subject of classical - quantum correspondence .    as remarked earlier",
    ", it seems ironic that a pure quantum effect like tunneling should bear the marks of the underlying classical phase space structures .",
    "however , it is useful to to recall the statement by heller that tunneling is only meaningful with classical dynamics as the baseline .",
    "thus , insights into the nature of the classical dynamics translates into a deeper mechanistic insight into the corresponding quantum dynamics . indeed",
    ", one way of thinking about classical - quantum correspondence is that classical mechanics is providing us with the best possible  basis \" to describe the quantum evolution .",
    "the wide range of contributions in this volume are a testimony to the richness of the phenomenon of dynamical tunneling and the utility of such a classical - quantum correspondence perspective . in this article",
    "i focus on the specific field of quantum control and show as to how dynamical tunneling can lead to useful insights into the control mechanism@xcite .",
    "the hope is that more such studies will eventually result in control strategies which are firmly rooted in the intutive classical world , yet accounting for the classically forbidden pathways and mechanisms in a consistent fashion .",
    "this is a tall order , and some may even argue as an unnecessary effort in these days of fast computers and smart and efficient algorithms to solve fairly high dimensional quantum dynamics .",
    "however , in this context , it is useful to remember the following which was written by born , heisenberg , and jordan nearly eighty years ago@xcite     _ the starting point of our theoretical approach was the conviction that the difficulties that have been encountered at every step in quantum theory in the last few years could be surmounted only by establishing a mathematical system for the mechanics of atomic and electronic motions , which would have a unity and simplicity comparable with the system of classical mechanics ... further developement of the theory , an important task will lie in the closer investigation of the nature of this correspondence and in the description of the manner in which symbolic quantum geometry goes over into visualizable classical geometry . _",
    "\"    the above remark was made in an era when computers were nonexistent .",
    "nevertheless , it is remarkably prescient since even in the present era one realizes the sheer difficulty in implementing an all - quantum dynamical study on even relatively small molecules@xcite . in any case , it is not entirely unreasonable to argue that large scale quantum dynamical studies will still require some form of an implicit classical - quantum correspondence approach to grasp the underlying mechanistic details . with the above remark in mind",
    "i start things off by revisiting the original paper@xcite by davis and heller since , in my opinion , it is ideal from the pedagogical point of view .",
    "three decades ago , davis and heller in their pioneering study@xcite gave a clear example of dynamical tunneling .",
    "a short recount of this work including the famous plots of the classical trajectories and the associated quantum eigenstates can be found in heller s article in this volume .",
    "however , i revisit this model here in order to bring forth a couple of important points that seem to have been overlooked in subsequent works .",
    "first , the existence of another class of eigenstate pairs , called as circulating states@xcite , which can exert considerable influence on the usual tunneling doublets at higher energies .",
    "second , a remark in the original paper@xcite which can be considered as a harbinger for chaos - assisted tunneling .",
    "as shown below , there are features in the original model that are worth studying in some detail even after three decades since the original paper was published .",
    "the hamiltonian of choice is the two degrees of freedom ( 2dof , in what follows the acronymn dof stands for degrees of freedom ) barbanis - like model@xcite @xmath1 with the labels ` s ' and ` u ' denoting the symmetric and unsymmetric stretch modes respectively .",
    "the above hamiltonian has also been studied@xcite in great detail to uncover the correspondence between classical stability of the motion and quantum spectral features , wavefunctions , and energy transfer .",
    "the potential is symmetric with respect to @xmath2 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] but there is no potential barrier .",
    "davis and heller used the parameter values @xmath3 , and @xmath4 for which the dissociation energy @xmath5 . note that the masses are taken to be unity and one is working in units such that @xmath6 .",
    "the key observation by davis and heller was that despite the lack of any potential barriers several bound eigenstates came in symmetric - antisymmetric pairs @xmath7 and @xmath8 with energy splittings much smaller than the fundamental frequencies _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath9 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the various splittings between adjacent eigenstates are shown and it is clear that several  tunneling \" pairs appear above a certain threshold energy .",
    "poincar surface of sections .",
    "note that large scale chaos appears for @xmath10 .",
    "the formation of a separatrix and two classically disjoint regular regions can be seen at @xmath11 due to the symmetric mode periodic orbit becoming unstable .",
    "the regular regions almost vanish near the dissociation energy . in the bottom row",
    "some of the chaotic orbits have been suppressed , for clarity of the figure , by showing them in gray.,width=566,height=377 ]    how can one understand the onset of such near degeneracies in the system ?",
    "the crucial insight that davis and heller provided was that the appearance of such doublets is correlated with the large scale changes in the classical phase space .",
    "the nature of the phase space with increasing total energy is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] using the @xmath12 poincar surface of section .",
    "such a surface of section , following standard methods , is constructed by recording the points , with momentum @xmath13 , of the intersection of a trajectory with the the @xmath14 plane in the phase space .",
    "such a procedure for several trajectories with specific total energy generates a typical surface of section as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and clearly indicates the global nature of the phase space .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the phase space for @xmath15 is mostly regular while higher energy phase spaces exhibit mixed regular - chaotic dynamics .",
    "one of the most prominent change happens when the symmetric stretch periodic orbit @xmath16 becomes unstable around @xmath17 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the consequence of such a bifurcation can be clearly seen for @xmath11 as the formation of two classically disjoint regular regions .",
    "in fact , the two regular regions signal a @xmath18:@xmath18 resonance between the stretching modes .",
    "the crucial point to observe here is that classical trajectories initiated in one of the regular regions can not evolve into the other regular region . with increasing energy",
    "the classically disjoint regular regions move further apart and almost vanish near the dissociation energy .",
    "the result presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] in fact closely mirrors the topological changes , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , in the phase space . thus , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] a sequence of eigenstates with very small splittings begins right around the energy at which the symmetric periodic orbit becomes unstable .",
    "the unsymmetric stretch , however , becomes unstable at a higher energy @xmath19 and one can observe in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] another sequence that seemingly begins near this point .",
    "note that at higher energies it is not easy to identify any more sequences , but small splittings are still observed .",
    "the important thing to note here is that not only do the splittings but the individual eigenstates also correlate with the changes in the phase space .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show a set of four eigenstates to illustrate an important point - as soon as the @xmath18:@xmath18 resonance manifests itself in the phase space , the tunneling doublets start to form and an integrable normal form approximation is insufficient to account for the splittings .",
    "note that the phase space is mostly regular at the energies of interest .",
    "a much more detailed analysis can be found in the paper by farrelly and uzer@xcite .",
    "we begin by noting@xcite that the pair of eigenstates ( counting from the zero - point ) @xmath20 and @xmath21 are split by about @xmath22 whereas the pair @xmath23 and @xmath24 are separated by about @xmath25 . in both cases the splitting is smaller than the fundamental frequencies , which are of order unity .",
    "note that the latter pair of states appears to be a part of the sequence in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that starts right after the bifurcation of the symmetric stretch periodic orbit .",
    "since the original mode frequencies are nonresonant , one can obtain a normal form approximation@xcite to the original hamiltonian and see if the obtained splittings can be explained satisfactorily .",
    "in other words , the observed @xmath26 are coming from the perturbation that couples both the modes and in such a case there is no reason for classifying them as tunneling doublets .",
    "however , from the coordinate space representations of the states shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] one observes that there is an important difference between the two pairs of states .",
    "the pair @xmath27 seems to have a perturbed nodal structure and hence one can approximately assign the states using the zeroth - order quantum numbers @xmath28 . inspecting the figure leads to the assignment @xmath29 and @xmath30 for states @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively .",
    "if the above arguments are correct then the splitting @xmath31 should be obtainable from the normal form hamiltonian . since the theory of normal forms",
    "is explained in detail in several textbooks@xcite , i will provide a brief derivation below .",
    "begin by using the unperturbed harmonic action - angle variables @xmath32 defined via the canonical transformation ( similar set for @xmath33 mode ) : @xmath34 to express the original hamiltonian as @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "since @xmath37 is purely oscillatory the angle average @xmath38 and thus to @xmath39 the normal form hamiltonian can be identified with the zeroth - order @xmath40 above .",
    "the first nontrivial correction arises at @xmath41 and can be obtained using the @xmath39 generating function @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the coefficients in the fourier expansion of the oscillatory part of @xmath44 .",
    "one now obtains the @xmath41 correction to the hamiltonian as @xmath45 with the bar denoting angle averaging of the poisson bracket involving @xmath46 and @xmath37 . performing the calculations the normal form at @xmath41",
    "is obtained as @xmath47 with @xmath48\\ ] ] the primitive bohr - sommerfeld quantization @xmath49 yields the quantum eigenvalues perturbatively to @xmath41 .",
    "the procedure can be repeated to obtain the normal form hamiltonian at higher orders .",
    "for instance , farrelly and uzer have@xcite computed the normal form out to @xmath50 and used pad resummation techniques to improve in cases when the zeroth - order frequencies are near - resonant . for our qualitative discussions ,",
    "the @xmath41 normal form is sufficient .    : @xmath18 resonance is just starting to appear .",
    "the upper panel shows the @xmath51 coordinate space representations and the lower panels show the corresponding husimi distributions in the @xmath12 surface of section of the phase space .",
    "the first two states ( @xmath52 ) can be assigned approximate zeroth - order quantum numbers @xmath28 whereas the last two states ( @xmath53 ) show perturbed nodal features .",
    "clear difference in the phase space nature of the eigenstates can be seen .",
    "see text for details.,width=604,height=453 ]    ) of the davis - heller system involving three states . as in the previous figure , the @xmath51 and phase space husimi representations",
    "are also shown .",
    "the first and the last states appear to be strongly mixed states .",
    "the middle state seems relatively cleaner .",
    "does chaos play a role in this case ?",
    "detailed discussions in the text.,width=566,height=377 ]    notice that the normal form hamiltonian above is integrable since it is ignorable in the angle variables . indeed , using the normal form and the approximate assignments of the eigenstates shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] one finds @xmath54 which is in fair agreement with the actual numerical value .",
    "thus , a large part of the splitting @xmath31 can be explained classically . on the other hand , although the states @xmath23 and @xmath24 seem to have an identifiable nodal structure ( cf .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , it is clear that they are significantly perturbed .",
    "nevertheless , persisting with an approach based on counting the nodes , states @xmath23 and @xmath24 can be assigned as @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively .",
    "using the normal form one estimates @xmath57 and this is about a factor of two larger than the numerically computed value .",
    "thus , the splitting in this case is not accounted for solely by classical considerations .",
    "one might argue that a higher order normal form might lead to better agreement , but the phase space husimi distributions of the eigenstates shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] suggests otherwise .",
    "the husimi disributions , when compared to the classical phase spaces shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , clearly show that the pair @xmath58 are localized in the newly created @xmath18:@xmath18 resonance zone .",
    "hence , this pair of states is directly influenced by the nonlinear resonance and the splitting between them can not be accurately described by the normal form hamiltonian .",
    "indeed , as discussed by farrelly and uzer@xcite , in this instance one needs to consider a resonant hamiltonian which explicitly takes the @xmath18:@xmath18 resonance into account .",
    "this provides a clear link between dynamical tunneling , appearance of closely spaced doublets and creation of new , in this case a nonlinear resonance , phase space structures . the choice of states in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is different from what is usually shown as the standard example for dynamical tunneling pairs .",
    "however , in the discussion above the states were chosen intentionally with the purpose of illustrating the onset of near - degeneracy due to the formation of a nonlinear resonance . in a typical situation involving near - integrable phase spaces",
    "there are several such resonances ranging from low orders to fairly high orders .",
    "the importance of a specific resonance depends sensitively on the effective value of the planck s constant@xcite .",
    "indeed , detailed studies@xcite have shown that excellent agreement with numerically computed splittings can be obtained if proper care is taken to include the various resonances .",
    "clear and striking examples in this context can be found in the contributions by schlagheck _",
    "et al . _ and bcker _ et al . _",
    "in this volume .",
    "to finish the discussion of the davis - heller system i show an example which involves states forming tunneling pairs that are fairly complicated both in terms of their coordinate space representations as well as their phase space husimi distributions .",
    "the example involves three states @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 around @xmath62 , which is rather close to the dissociation energy . in the original work@xcite davis and",
    "heller noted that the splittings seem to increase by an order of magnitude in this high energy region .",
    "notably , they commented that `` _ perhaps the degree of irregularity between the regular regions plays some part _ '' . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the variation of energy levels with the coupling parameter @xmath63 is shown .",
    "one can immediately see that the three states are right at the center of an avoided crossing .",
    "the coordinate space representations of the states shows extensive mixing for states @xmath59 and @xmath61 while the state @xmath60 seems to be cleaner .",
    "the husimi distributions for the respective states conveys the same message .",
    "comparing to the phase space sections shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] it is clear that the husimis for state @xmath59 and @xmath61 seem to be ignoring the classical regular - chaotic divison - a clear indication of the quantum nature of the mixing . although it is not possible to strictly assign these states as chaotic , a closer inspection does show substantial husimi contribution in the border between the regular and chaotic regions .",
    "interestingly , the pairwise splitting between the states is nearly the same but localized linear combinations of any two states exhibits two - level dynamics .",
    "thus , the situation here is not of the generic@xcite chaos - assisted tunneling one wherein one of the states is chaotic and interacts with the other two regular states .",
    "nevertheless , linear combinations of the three states reveal ( not shown here ) that they are mixed with each other .",
    "a look at the coordinate and phase space representations of states @xmath59 and @xmath61 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] reveals that a different kind of state is causing the three - way interaction .",
    "it turns out that in the davis - heller model there is another class of symmetry - related pairs that appear when the unsymmetric mode becomes unstable . in the original work they were refered to as  circulating \" states which displayed much larger splitting then the so - called local mode pairs .",
    "the case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] involves one of the circulating pairs interacting with the usual local mode doublet leading to the complicated three - way interaction .",
    "the subtle nature of this interaction is evident from the coordinate space representation of state @xmath60 which exhibits a broken symmetry . interestingly , and as far as i can tell ,",
    "there has been very little understanding of such three - state interactions in the davis - heller system and further studies are needed to shed some light on the phase space nature of the relevant eigenstates .",
    "in the previous section the intimate connection between dynamical tunneling and phase space structures was introduced .",
    "the importance of a nonlinear resonance and a hint of the role played by the chaos ( cf .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) is evident .",
    "several other contributions in this volume discuss the importance of various phase space strucures using different models , both continuous hamiltonians and discrete maps . in the molecular context ,",
    "various mode - mode resonances play a critical role in the process of intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution ( ivr)@xcite . the phenomenon of ivr is at the heart of chemical reaction dynamics and it is now well established that molecules at high levels of excitation display all the richness , complexity and subtelty that is expected from nonlinear dynamics of multidimensional systems@xcite . in this",
    "context , dynamical tunneling is an important agent@xcite of ivr and state mixing for a certain class of initial states ( akin to the so called noon states@xcite ) which are typically prepared by the experiments . the importance of the anharmonic resonances to ivr and the regimes wherein dynamical tunneling , mediated by these resonances , is expected to be crucial is described in some detail in this volume by leitner .",
    "the phase space perspective on leitner s viewpoint can be found in a recent review@xcite ( see also heller s contribution in the present volume ) . in this regard",
    "it is interesting to note that there has been a renaissance of sorts in chemical dynamics with researchers critically examining the validity of the two pillars of reaction rate theory@xcite - transition state theory ( tst ) and the rice - ramsperger - kassel - marcus ( rrkm ) theory .",
    "since both theories have classical dynamics at their foundation , advances in our understanding of nonlinear dynamics and continuing efforts to characterize the phase space structure of systems with three or more degrees of freedom are beginning to yield crucial mechanistic insights into the dynamics@xcite . at the same time",
    ", rapid advances in experimental techniques and theoretical understanding of the reaction mechanisms has led researchers to focus on the issue of controlling the dynamics of molecules .",
    "what implications might dynamical tunneling have on our efforts to control the atomic and molecular dynamics ? in the rest of this article",
    "i focus on this issue and use two seemingly simple and well studied systems as examples to highlight the role of dynamical tunneling in the context of coherent control .",
    "both examples are in the context of periodically driven systems and i refer the reader to the work of flatt and holthaus@xcite for an exposition of the close quantum - classical correspondence in such systems .      historically , an early indication that dynamical tunneling could be sensitive to the chaos in the underlying phase space came from the study of strongly driven double well potential by lin and ballentine@xcite .",
    "the model hamiltonian in this case can be written down as @xmath64 with @xmath65 being the frequency of the monochromatic field ( henceforth refered to as the driving field ) and the unperturbed part @xmath66 is the hamiltonian corresponding to a double well potential with two symmetric minima at @xmath67 and a maximum at @xmath68 .",
    "following the original work@xcite , the parameters of the unperturbed system ( assuming atomic units ) are taken to be @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 for which the potential has a barrier height @xmath72 and supports about eight tunneling doublets .",

    "more specifically , several studies have explored the possibility of controlling various atomic and molecular phenomenon using bichromatic fields with the relative phase between the fields providing an additional control parameter . in the present context ,",
    "for example , sangouard _ et al .",
    "_ exploited the physics of adiabatic passage to show that an appropriate combination of @xmath111 field leads to suppression of tunneling in the driven double well model@xcite .",
    "the choice of relative phase between the two fields allowed them to localize the initial state in one or the other well .",
    "however , the parameter regimes in the work by sangouard _ et al . _",
    "correspond to the underlying phase space being near - integrable and hence a minimal role of the chaotic sea .",
    "more relevant to the mixed regular - chaotic phase space case presented in fig .",

    "[ fig6 ] for @xmath126 ( red arrows ) .",

    "[ fig9 ] the results of such a computation are shown and it is immediately clear that even in the presence of @xmath114-control field six states contribute to the decay of @xmath103 over the entire range of @xmath125 .",
    "this is further confirmed in fig .",
    "[ fig9](b ) where the plot of the overlap intensities shows multiple floquet states participating nearly equally in the decay dynamics of the initial state .",
    "the final clue comes from inspecting the husimi distributions shown in fig .",

    "thus , if one or more chaotic states are already influencing the dynamics of @xmath103 at @xmath126 then the bichromatic control is expected to be difficult .",
    "an earlier study@xcite by latka _",
    "_ on the bichromatically driven pendulum system also suggested that the ability to control the dynamics is strongly linked to the existence of chaotic states .    the model problem in this section and the results point to a direct role of chaos - assisted pathways in the failure of an attempt to bichromatically control the dynamics .",
    "however , it is not yet clear if control strategies involving more general fields would exhibit similar characteristics .",
    "there is some evidence in the literature which indicates that quantum optimal control landscapes might be highly convoluted if the underlying classical phase space exhibits large scale chaos@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , further studies need to be done and the resulting insights are expected to be crucial in any effort to control the dynamics of multilevel systems .      the driven morse oscillator system has served as a paradigm model for understanding the dissociation dynamics of diatomic molecules .",
    "studies spanning nearly three decades have explored the physics of this system in exquisite detail .",
    "consequently , a great deal is known about the mechanism of dissociation both from the quantum and classical perspectives .",
    "indeed , the focus of researchers nowadays is to control , either suppress or enhance , the dissociation dynamics and various suggestions have been put forward . in addition , one hopes that the ability to control a single vibrational mode dynamics can lead to a better understanding of the complications that arise in the case of polyatomic molecular systems wherein several vibrational modes are coupled at the energies of interest .",
    "several important insights have originated from classical - quantum correspondence studies which have established that molecular dissociation , in analogy to multiphoton ionization of atoms , occurs due to the system gaining energy by diffusing through the chaotic regions of the phase space .",
    "for example , an important experimental study by dietrich and corkum has shown@xcite , amongst other things , the validity of the chaotic dissociation mechanism .",

    "an interesting question is as follows .",
    "since a detailed mechanistic understanding of the role of various phase space structures of the driven morse system is known , is it possible to design local phase space barriers to effect control over the dissociation dynamics ?",
    "in particular , the central question here is whether the local phase space barriers are also able to suppress the quantum dissociation dynamics .",
    "there is an obvious connection between the above question and the theme of this volume - quantum mechanics can  shortcircuit \" the classical phase space barriers due to the phenomenon of dynamical tunneling .",
    "thus , such phase space barriers might be very effective in controlling the classical dissociation dynamics but might fail completely when it comes to controlling the quantum dissociation dynamics .",
    "there is a catch here , however , since there is also the possibility that the cantori barrier in the classical phase space may be even more restrictive in the quantum case .",
    "thus , creation or existence of a phase space barrier invariably leads to subtle competition between classical transport and quantum dynamical tunneling through the barrier . as expected",
    ", the delicate balance between the classical and quantum mechanism is determined by the effective planck constant of the system of interest .",
    "an earlier detailed review@xcite by radons , geisel and rubner is highly reccomended for a nice introduction to the subject of classical - quantum correspondence perspective on phase space transport through kolmogoroff - arnold - moser ( kam ) and cantori barriers . in the driven morse oscillator case , brown and wyatt showed@xcite that the cantori barriers do leave their imprint on the quantum dissociation dynamics and act as even stronger barriers as compared to the classical system . maitra and heller in their study@xcite on transport through cantori in the whisker map have clearly highlighted the classical versus quantum competition .     and",

    "in fact , it is tempting to think that every quantum control algorithm works by creating local phase space dynamical barriers and the efficiency of the control is decided by the classical - quantum competition .",
    "however , at this point of time there is very little work towards making such a connection and the above statement is , at best , a conjecture . for the purpose of this article",
    ", i turn to the driven morse oscillator system to provide an example for the importance of resonance - assisted tunneling in controlling the dissociation dynamics .",

    "i feel that it is best to illustrate with a realistic molecular example .",
    "hopefully , the generality of the arguments will become apparent later on .",
    "for the present purpose i choose the diatomic molecule hydrogen fluoride ( hf ) as the specific example .",
    "any diatomic molecule could have been chosen but hf is studied here due to the fact that brown and wyatt have already discussed the role of cantori barriers to the dissociation dynamics in some detail .",

    "these parameters correspond to ground electronic state of the hf molecule supporting @xmath144 bound states .",
    "note that atomic units are used for both the molecular and field parameters with time being measured in units of the field period @xmath145 .",
    "the only difference between the present work and that of brown and wyatt has to do with the field - matter coupling .",

    "[ fig10 ] ( inset ) , the focus is on understanding and controlling the dissociation dynamics of the @xmath131 excited morse oscillator eigenstate .",
    "there are several reasons for such a choice and i mention two of the most important reasons .",
    "firstly , the earlier study@xcite has established that @xmath131 of hf happens to be in an energy regime wherein two specific cantori barriers in the classical phase space affect the dissociation dynamics . moreover , for driving frequency @xmath130 , two of the zeroth - order eigenstates @xmath131 and @xmath132 have unperturbed energies such that @xmath155 and hence corresponds to a two - photon resonant situation .",
    "secondly , for a field strength of @xmath152 tw/@xmath154 , the dissociation probability of the ground vibrational state is negligible .",
    "far stronger field strengths are required to dissociate the @xmath156 state and ionization process starts to compete with the dissociation at such high intensities .",
    "thus , in order to to illustrate the role of phase space barriers in the dissociation dynamics without such additional complications , the specific initial state @xmath131 is chosen .",
    "incidentally , such a scenario is quite feasible since a suitably chirped laser field can populate the @xmath131 state very efficiently from the initial ground state @xmath156 and one imagines coming in with the monochromatic laser to dissociate the molecule .",

    "[ fig12 ] which show the uncontrolled and controlled cases respectively .",
    "although , the kam barriers seem to have reduced the extent of stochasticity , the @xmath172:@xmath18 resonance is intact and appears to occupy slightly larger area in the phase space . thus , this certainly indicates that a significant amount of the quantum dissociation is occuring due to the rat mechanism involving the three morse states @xmath175 , and @xmath176 as discussed before .",

    "[ fig13](b ) , the resulting simplified control hamiltonian fails to create the desired barrier .",

    "indeed computations ( not published ) for different sets of parameters have supported the viewpoint expressed above .",

    "focused on classical suppression of ionization by creating local phase space barriers in case of the driven one - dimensional hydrogen atom@xcite . around the same time",
    "highlighted@xcite the importance of the rat mechanism in order to obtain accurate decay lifetimes of localized wavepackets in the same system .",
    "work is currently underway to see if the conclusions made in this section hold in the driven atomic system as well _ i.e. , _ whether the attempt to suppress the ionization by creating local phase space barriers is foiled by the phenomenon of rat .",
    "the two examples discussed in this work illustrate a key point - _ dynamical tunneling plays a nontrivial role in the process of quantum control .",
    "_ in the first example of the driven quartic double well it is clear that bichromatic control fails in regimes where chaos - assisted tunneling is important . in the second example of a driven morse oscillator it is apparent that efforts to control by building phase space kam barriers fail when resonance - assisted tunneling is possible . in both instances the competition between classical and quantum mechanisms",
    "is brought to the forefront .",
    "although the two examples shown here represent the failure of specific control schemes due to dynamical tunneling , one must not take this to be a general conclusion .",
    "it is quite possible that some other control schemes might owe their efficiency to the phenonmenon of dynamical tunneling itself .",
    "further classical - quantum correspondence studies on control with more general driving fields are required in order to confirm ( or refute ) the conclusions presented in this chapter .    at the same time the two examples presented here are certainly not the the last word ; establishing the role of dynamical tunneling in quantum coherent control requires one to step into the murky world of three or more degrees of freedom systems@xcite .",
    "i mention two model systems , currently being studied in our group , in order to stress upon some of the key issues that might crop up in such high dimensional systems .",
    "for example , two coupled morse oscillators which are driven by a monochromatic field already presents a number of challenges both from the technical as well as conceptual viewpoints .",
    "the technical challenge arises due to the fact that dimensionality constraints do not allow one to visualize the global phase space structures as easily as done in this chapter .",
    "one approach is to use the method of local frequency analysis@xcite to construct the arnold web _ i.e. , _ the network of nonlinear resonances that regulate the multidimensional phase space transport . in a previous work@xcite , involving a time - independent hamiltonian system , the utility of such an approach and the validity of the rat mechanism has been established .",
    "however ,  lifting \" quantum dynamics onto the arnold web is an intriguing possibility which is still an open issue . on the conceptual side",
    "there are several issues with multidimensional systems .",
    "i mention a few of them here .",
    "firstly , even at the classical level one has the possibility of transport like arnold diffusion@xcite which is genuinely a three or more dof effect and has no counterpart in systems with less than three dofs .",
    "note that arnold diffusion is typically a very long time process and is notoriously difficult to observe in realistic physical systems@xcite .",
    "moreover , arguments can be made for the irrelevance of arnold diffusion ( or some similar process ) in quantum systems due to the finiteness of the planck constant .",
    "secondly , an interesting competition occurs in systems such as the driven coupled morse oscillators . even in the absence of the field",
    "the dynamics is nonintegrable and one can be in a regime where the modes are exchanging energy but none of the modes gain enough energy to dissociate . on the other hand , in the absence of mode - mode coupling , a weak enough field can excite the system without leading to dissociation",
    ". however , in the presence of such a weak field and the mode - mode coupling one can have significant dissociation of a specific vibrational mode . clearly , there is nontrivial competition between transport due to mode - mode resonances , field - mode resonances and the chaotic regions@xcite .",
    "selective control of such driven coupled systems is an active research area@xcite today and the lessons learnt from the two examples suggest that dynamical tunneling in one form or another can play a central role . in the context of studying the potential competition between arnold diffusion and dynamical tunneling ,",
    "i should mention the driven coupled quartic oscillator system with the hamiltonian : @xmath248 in the absence of the field @xmath249 the hamiltonian reduces to the case originally studied by tomsovic , bohigas and ullmo wherein the existence of chaos - assisted tunneling was established in exquisite detail@xcite . at the same time , with @xmath250 the system represents one of the few examples for which the phenomenon of arnold diffusion has been investigated over a number of years .",
    "nearly a decade ago , demikhovskii , izrailev , and malyshev studied@xcite a variant of the above hamiltonian to uncover the fingerprint of arnold diffusion on the quantum eigenstates and dynamics .",
    "an interesting question , amongst many others , is this : _ will the fluctuations in the chaos - assisted tunneling splittings for @xmath249 , observed for varying @xmath108 , survive in the presence of the field ? _    a related topic which i have not touched upon in this article has to do with the control of ivr using weak external fields . based on the insights gained from studies done until now on field - free ivr",
    "( see also the contribution by leitner in this volume ) , it is natural to expect that dynamical tunneling could play spoilsport for certain class of initial states that are prepared experimentally .",
    "the issue , however , is far more subtle and more studies in this direction might shed light on the mechanism by which quantum optimal control methods work .",
    "for instance , recent proposals on quantum control by takami and fujisaki@xcite and the so called  quantized ulam conjecture \" by gruebele and wolynes@xcite take advantage ( implicitly ) of the system having a completely chaotic phase space .",
    "dynamical tunneling is not an issue in such cases .",
    "however , in more generic instances of systems with mixed regular - chaotic phase space , a quantitative and qualitative understanding of dynamical tunneling becomes imperative .",
    "given the level of detail at which one is now capable of studying the clasically forbidden processes , as reflected by the varied contributions in this volume , i expect exciting progress in this direction .",
    "i think that this is an appropriate forum to acknowledge the genesis of the current and past research of mine on dynamical tunneling . in this context",
