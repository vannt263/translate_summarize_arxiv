    "generalized parton distributions ( gpd s ) encode detailed dynamical information on the internal structure of hadrons and have thus become in recent times a major theoretical and experimental endeavor ( for extensive reviews see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "they represent a natural interpolation between form factors and quark distribution functions . actually ,",
    "while form factors and distribution functions provide in a separate way the spatial and momentum quark distributions in a hadron respectively , gpd s provide a simultaneous phase - space description of the quark hadron content as far as the position - momentum uncertainty relations allow  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , gpd s show up in hard exclusive processes such as deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) or hard electroproduction of mesons .",
    "factorization for hard exclusive electroproduction of mesons in qcd was proved in ref .",
    "effects of the regge exchanges to exclusive processes were investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we are interested in gpd s for the pion .",
    "although there are little chances of measuring them directly in experiment , the pion gpd s are amenable to indirect experimental determination as well as studies both on transverse  @xcite as well as euclidean  @xcite lattices ( for a combination of experimental and lattice - based reconstruction in the proton case see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "in addition , there are many theoretical advantages for studying this quark - antiquark bound state . in the first place , in the chiral limit where the current quark masses vanish , the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry of the qcd vacuum generates pions as the zero modes .",
    "their properties are expected to be dominated by the broken chiral symmetry while confinement effects are expected not to be crucial .",
    "actually , finite mass corrections to gpd s of the pion have been treated in the standard  @xcite and partially - quenched  @xcite chiral perturbation theory , while the breakdown of the expansion for small @xmath2 has been pointed out in ref .  @xcite .",
    "besides , compared to the nucleon there are no spin complications for the pion case , and thus the study reduces to two single scalar gpd function , one for each isospin combination .",
    "finally , the pion provides a useful framework to learn on the interplay between the chiral symmetry and the light cone features , since we are studying the behavior of the would - be goldstone boson in the infinite momentum frame .    despite the intrinsic complexity of the gpd s ,",
    "there is a number of simple conditions which ultimately are consequences of the poincar and electromagnetic gauge invariance and provide _ a priori _ tests on the validity of theoretical calculations .",
    "proper support and polynomiality restrictions on the gpd moments  @xcite are manifestations of the lorentz invariance .",
    "we note that polynomiality is not satisfied in light - front calculations .",
    "double distributions do not suffer from this problem  @xcite ( using the double distributions is a way of _ projecting _ the lorentz - violating term onto the right space ) although they require the so - called @xmath3-terms  @xcite to comply with the most general polynomial allowed by the dimensional analysis .",
    "normalization conditions and sum rules are a manifestation of the gauge invariance , which at the quark level requires the correct implementation of the electromagnetic ward - takahashi identities .",
    "the positivity bound  @xcite underlines the hilbert - space quantum - mechanical probabilistic nature of pion light - cone wave functions , and may impose relevant constraints on admissible regularizations based mainly on subtractions of ultraviolet divergences .",
    "soft pion theorems based on pcac relate gpd s to parton distribution amplitudes ( pda s )  @xcite . on a theoretical level",
    ", the amazing aspect of gpd s is that the constraints that ought to be fulfilled _ a priori _ are so demanding and intricate that it is extremely difficult to provide anstze fulfilling all of them simultaneously .",
    "this is why dynamical calculations going beyond reasonable but admittedly _ ad hoc _ parameterizations are particularly interesting and instructive . on the other hand , dynamical models providing",
    "gpd s are also generating mutually consistent parton distribution functions , parton distribution amplitudes , and form factors .",
    "although this may appear a rather trivial statement , it imposes demanding and tight constraints on details of the calculation , and more specifically on the proper handling of ultraviolet divergences based on the correct implementation of electromagnetic and chiral ward - takahashi identities . even in the case of a simple hadron such as the pion in the chiral limit , the above mentioned necessary conditions provide powerful limitations and in some cases clash with well established prejudices about the meaning and realization of a relativistic bound - state wave functions in quantum field theory @xcite .    in the present work we determine gpd s incorporating all the desirable properties required by the symmetries in two chiral quark models , the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl )  ( for reviews see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) and the spectral quark model ( sqm )  @xcite , which essentially is a way of introducing regularization in such a way that the vector - meson dominance is built in .",
    "these field theoretical models incorporate the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "chiral quark models use the large-@xmath4 expansion at leading order , where the observables are obtained with one - loop quark diagrams .",
    "the present calculation extends previous calculations of pdf s  @xcite and pda s @xcite .",
    "diagonal gpd in impact parameter space in these models were considered @xcite .",
    "our present gpd result reproduces consistently all these particular cases .",
    "recently , the transition distribution amplitude ( tda ) @xcite has also been evaluated in sqm  @xcite .",
    "there has been a number of calculations of gpd s and related quantities of the pion within the framework incorporating chiral symmetry .",
    "early calculations of pion gpd s were done in an instanton - inspired model characterized by a momentum dependent mass function of a dipole form @xcite , while pdf s were evaluated in the same model in @xcite .",
    "the crossing - related @xmath5gpa was also evaluated in ref .",
    "@xcite in the same instanton model disregarding the momentum dependence of the quark mass , a valid assumption in the limit of small instantons . in that limit ,",
    "end point discontinuities arise .",
    "a full consideration of poles in the complex plane in a non - local version of the njl model was described in ref .",
    "@xcite . generally , the nonlocality of the quark mass function generated incorrect normalization , since as noted later , pcac should be properly incorporated  @xcite , an issue also emphasized more recently in ref .",
    "@xcite . a rather interesting feature of ref .",
    "@xcite is that end - point discontinuities reappear after pcac is incorporated , even for momentum - dependent quark mass functions , against the widely spread prejudice that they only arise for momentum - independent masses .",
    "the ope and duality aspects of gpd s have been discussed in ref .",
    "light - front calculations have been undertaken in ref .",
    "@xcite for point couplings with subsequent insertion of gaussian wave functions , however the approach violates polynomiality .",
    "power - law wave functions and gpd s of the pion proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite satisfy polynomiality but violate positivity ( see @xcite ) .",
    "studies paying particular attention to polynomiality were first made by tiburzi and miller @xcite who proceeded via double distributions  @xcite . however , regularization in these works was done by introducing momentum dependent form factors , which makes them difficult to reconcile with the gauge invariance .",
    "the model of ref .",
    "@xcite based on a pseudoscalar pion - quark coupling does not incorporate chiral symmetry and does not fulfill the momentum sum rule .",
    "noguera , theul , and vento carried out a calculation in the njl model based on the light - front coordinates , where the fulfillment of polynomiality for non - vanishing momentum transfer is not apparent analytically  @xcite , and in fact numerical integration was required to establish this property .",
    "our njl results agree with that work , with the important methodological difference that the double distributions , where polynomiality is manifest , are used throughout . moreover , our regularization is somewhat different than in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , we also use the non - linear rather than linear realization of the chiral field .    despite the numerous model calculations of the gpd s",
    ", it remains to date unclear what is their significance or impact on the interpretation of actual experiments and/or lattice data .",
    "this is , perhaps , why most calculations of the gpd s based on dynamical quark models and going beyond just phenomenological parameterizations do not address this issue .",
    "however , while experimental or lattice results generate scale - dependent gpd s , embodying the well established logarithmic scaling violations in qcd , it is notorious that models generally produce scale independent functions . thus , quark models represent those distributions at a _ given _ low energy scale .",
    "it is noteworthy that scaling violations can only be computed in the twist expansion order by order .",
    "for instance , for the structure functions @xmath6 with the bjorken @xmath7 and momentum @xmath8 one has for the quark model @xmath9 while for qcd @xmath10 where @xmath11 are low energy matrix elements with computable anomalous dimensions and depending logarithmically on the scale through the running coupling constant @xmath12 in this work we take @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the matching conditions are taking at a given scale @xmath15 order by order in the twist expansion @xmath16 a quite different issue is the operational definition of the low - energy reference scale @xmath15 . here",
    "we will use along the lines of previous works  @xcite the momentum fraction carried by the valence quarks .",
    "it turns out that in order to describe the available pion phenomenology the initial scale @xmath15 from the quark model must be very low , around @xmath17 . at such low scale",
    "the perturbative expansion parameter in the evolution equations is large , @xmath18 , which makes the evolution very fast for scales close to the initial value @xmath15 .",
    "none of the previous chiral - quark - model studies of the genuine gpd s ( off - forward non - diagonal ) carried out the qcd evolution , starting from the initial condition provided by the models .",
    "the evolution is a major element of this work . as already mentioned , it is also a crucial element if one wishes to compare the model prediction to the data from experiments or lattice simulations .",
    "at the moment these data are available only for the forward diagonal parton distribution function of the pion ( pdf ) , or the pda .",
    "we have taken an effort to separate formal aspects of the calculation from the model - dependent technicalities of the regularization .",
    "that way we simply achieve the desired features on general grounds , such as the sum rules or the polynomiality conditions  @xcite .",
    "we stress this is achieved without a factorized form in the @xmath1 variable . in one of the considered models ( the spectral quark model ) the final results for the gpd s can be written in terms of rather simple but non - trivial analytic formulas , which allows for more insight into their properties .",
    "we also show that our gpd s satisfy the positivity bounds .",
    "in essence , all the known consistency conditions and constraints are indeed satisfied in our calculation .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec : def ] we list the definitions and properties of the gpd s .",
    "we introduce both the asymmetric and symmetric kinematics , as well as define the isospin projections .",
    "we give the generic quark - model expressions in terms of the two- and three - point functions .",
    "sections  [ sec : sqm ] and [ sec : njl ] contain the results of the spectral quark model and the njl model , respectively . we discuss the general need for the qcd evolution of chiral quark models in section [ sec : qcd - qm ] , where we define the matching condition in the light of phenomenological analyses , as well as euclidean and transverse lattice calculations .",
    "in particular , we show the evolved forward diagonal pdf of the pion and confront it with the results of the e615 experiment at fermilab  @xcite .",
    "this agreement is quite remarkable , but sets the quark model momentum scale to very low values , @xmath19  mev .",
    "likewise we also discuss the evolved pda as compared to the e791 measurement  @xcite of the pion light - cone wave function and to the lattice data .",
    "we show how the qcd evolution leads to vanishing of the pdf at @xmath20 and of pda at @xmath21 , which is the desired end - point behavior .",
    "the lo qcd evolution of our genuine gpd s , based on the standard erbl - dglap equations , is carried out in sect .",
    "[ sec : evol ] , where the obtained quark - model initial conditions are evolved to higher momentum scales .",
    "finally , in section [ concl ] we draw our main conclusions .",
    "the appendices contain the technique of analyzing the gpd s through the use of the @xmath0 representation for the propagators .",
    "this method , first introduced in the context of structure functions in refs .",
    "@xcite , allows for a manifestly covariant calculation and leads to simple formal expressions for the basic two- and three - point functions emerging in the analysis .",
    "the appearance of @xmath3-terms is manifest and natural in this treatment , based solely on the feynman diagrams in a conventional way .",
    "we also list explicitly the basic two- and three - point functions of the two considered model .",
    "we proceed via the double distributions , which leads to a simple proof of polynomiality  @xcite .",
    "the kinematics of the process and the assignment of momenta ( in the asymmetric way ) is displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig : diag ] and [ fig : diag2 ] . for the pions on the mass shell we have , adopting the standard notation @xmath22 note the sign convention for @xmath1 , positive in the physical region .",
    "the leading - twist off - forward ( @xmath23 ) non - diagonal ( @xmath24 ) generalized parton distribution ( gpd ) of the pion is defined as @xmath25 and the @xmath7 variable , @xmath26 , is defined in the _ asymmetric _ notation ( _ cf . _",

    "then @xmath45 with the symmetry properties about the @xmath46 point , @xmath47 the following sum rules hold : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the electromagnetic form factor , while @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the gravitational form factors of the pion ( see appendix  [ app : grav ] ) which satisfy the low energy theorem @xmath52 in the chiral limit  @xcite .",
    "sum rule ( [ norm ] ) expresses the electric charge conservation , while ( [ norm2 ] ) is responsible for the momentum sum rule in deep inelastic scattering . finally , for @xmath53 @xmath54 relating the distributions to the the pion s forward diagonal parton distribution function ( pdf ) , @xmath55 .",
    "the _ polynomiality _ conditions  @xcite state that @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the coefficient functions ( form factors ) depending on @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the polynomiality conditions follow from basic field - theoretic assumptions such as the lorentz invariance , time reversal , and hermiticity , hence are automatically satisfied in approaches that obey these requirements . conditions ( [ poly ] ) supply important tests of consistency . in our approach",
    "the polynomiality will be demonstrated straightforwardly in an analytic way through the use of double distributions , see appendix  [ sec : alpha ] .",
    "another constraint for the gpd s , the _ positivity bound _",
    "@xcite , is derived with the help of the schwartz inequality and the momentum representation of the pion light - cone wave functions . in the simplest form",
