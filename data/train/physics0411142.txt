    "the doppler effect is a well - known phenomenon that the frequency of a wave emitting from a moving object is shifted from the source frequency , originally discovered by christian doppler in 1843 @xcite .",
    "conventional doppler shift tells us that the measured frequency will increase when a source and observe approach each other . in virtue of this effect ,",
    "an immense variety of novel applications are widely established including weather and aircraft radar system , blood flow measurement , and discovery of new planets and binary stars .",
    "the inverse doppler effect refers to frequency shifts that are in the opposite sense to those mentioned above .",
    "it has been observed in a dielectric - loaded stripline cyclotron - resonance maser oscillator @xcite , the moving shock wave propagating through a photonic crystals @xcite and the moving boundary in an electrical transmission line @xcite .",
    "in fact , back to 1968 , the inverse doppler effect has been already predicted to occur in a left - handed material ( lhm ) with simultaneously negative permittivity and permeability @xcite .",
    "et al . _ discovered a microwave - plasma thin - wire structure exhibiting negative permittivity below the electronic plasma frequency @xcite and a magnet - free split - ring resonator structure exhibiting negative permeability below the magnetic plasma frequency @xcite . with the suggestion of pendry s theory ,",
    "the first experimental verification of a lhm was demonstrated @xcite , which has recently received much attention in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , up to our knowledge , inverse doppler effect in a left - handed material has not been demonstrated experimentally yet , not even by numerical experiments .    in this paper",
    ", we will study doppler effects for the reflected wave from a moving media and present theoretical formula for the doppler shift , which will be examined by first - principles numerical experiments using the finite difference time domain ( fdtd ) method .",
    "consider a plane electromagnetic wave propagation in medium @xmath0 and incident at an angle @xmath1 on an idealized moving medium @xmath2 .",
    "the incident wave have an angular frequency @xmath3 and a propagation vector @xmath4 ( in a lhm , the direction of group velocity , same as that of energy flux , is often antiparallel to phase velocity ) .",
    "to calculate doppler shift effectively for the reflected wave in such an inertial system , a primed coordinate frame embedded in the moving medium is introduced .",
    "the primed frame moves with the same velocity @xmath5 as the moving medium relative to the unprimed ( original ) coordinate system . here",
    "we keep the axes of the primed coordinate system parallel to corresponding axis of the unprimed system .",
    "therefore , we can treat the space components of both the primed and unprimed system as vectors in a common three - dimensional space .",
    "if the primed frame is moving with a velocity @xmath5 with respect to the unprimed , one can relate @xmath6 and @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 through a pure lorentz transformation ( no rotation of the space axes ) expressed in three - dimensional notation ( see podolsky and kunz @xcite ) , @xmath10 where @xmath11 and where @xmath12 is the unit vector in the direction of @xmath5 and @xmath13 is the transpose of @xmath14 .",
    "consider a @xmath15-vector expressed in the minkowski notation by @xmath16 .",
    "based on the theorem of invariant phase of an electromagnetic wave for the transformation , one can easily obtain @xmath17 which is the doppler shift in going to the primed frame .    to obtain a solution to the problem posed above it",
    "is convenient to firstly consider in the primed frame , in which the medium @xmath2 is at rest while the background moves with a velocity @xmath18 . in the primed frame",
    "there is no doppler shifts at the interface , we can set @xmath19 as the required generalization , where @xmath20 is the frequency of incident and reflected wave in the primed frame . using the inverse of eq .",
    "( [ frequ ] ) , one can replace eq .",
    "( [ eqn2 ] ) and then obtain @xmath21 where @xmath22 finally , one can obtain the reflected frequency in respects of the incident frequency as @xmath23 where @xmath1 and @xmath24 denotes the incident and reflected angle , and where @xmath25 and @xmath26 denotes the refractive index of the background for the incident and reflected wave , respectively . in the case of moving media ,",
    "the law of reflection and snell s law of refraction is no longer suitable at the interface .",
    "moreover , since the lhm is often a dispersive material , the refractive index ( @xmath26 ) of the background for the reflected wave is not the same as that of the background for the incident wave ( @xmath25 ) due to the doppler shift .    as",
    "a lhm is always a dispersive media , it can be described by the following debye model , @xmath27 when @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , it will be simplified to be the following drude s lossless dispersive model @xcite for the relative permittivity and permeability of the lhm @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the plasma frequency or the magnetic resonance frequency . the permittivity and permeability take negative values for frequencies below @xmath32 , which satisfy @xmath33 at frequency @xmath34 .",
    "combining eq .",
    "( [ doppler1 ] ) with the definition of negative refractive index in the lhm ( @xmath35 ) , we can obtain the doppler shift theoretically for the reflected wave @xmath36 ^ 2 - 4\\omega^2_{p1}(1-v / c)v / c}}{2(1-v / c ) } , \\label{lhmdoppler1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath37 . here",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath38 is the refractive index of the background for the incident wave and the plasma or magnetic resonance frequency for the background , respectively . using the above formula ,",
    "the doppler shift can be easily obtained by an analytical way if we know the incident frequency and the parameters in each medium .",
    "absorption will not exit for this idealized model for the lhm .",
    "moreover , in this paper , one is interested with the frequency shift of the reflected wave , not the intensity of the reflected waves .",

    "next , we will give some numerical examples to examine the doppler formula by first - principles numerical experiments using the finite difference time domain method @xcite .",
    "for simplicity , we consider the @xmath40-polarized electromagnetic wave incident normally on the moving media , which moves toward the source .",
    "it is similar for the case of the media moving away from the source .",
    "we perform firstly a fdtd simulation to study the case of two conventional materials . the background is air and the refractive index of the right moving medium is @xmath39 .",
    "a line source of continuous wave along @xmath41 direction is placed at the left side of the moving media , as well as the detector .",
    "since we only consider the electromagnetic wave incident normally on the interface , it is naturally chosen the periodic condition in the @xmath41 direction and the perfect matched layers ( pmls ) @xcite in the @xmath42 direction as numerical boundary treatments . due to stability of the fdtd algorithm @xmath43",
    ", the moving interface always moves less than @xmath44 for each time step . in all our simulations , a technique of parameter approximation based on the first order lagrange approximation",
    "the theoretical doppler formula for the conventional material is the same as that for the case of the lhm , except frequency - independent refractive index for conventional materials in eq .",

    ", the refractive index of the lhm for the incident frequency ( @xmath3 ) satisfies @xmath48 , matched with air .",
    "it has been shown that light can go through such an stationary air - lhm interface without reflection for any incident angle @xcite . however",
    ", this is only correct for the case of a stationary interface since the field boundary conditions at moving interface are quite different with those at the stationary case @xcite .",

    ", the reverse doppler effect arises due to the negative index of refraction .",
    "the definition of doppler shift tells us that when a source moves inside the lhm at the initial stationary frame , the abnormal doppler effect will be observed .",
