    "in photoproduction processes at hera , a quasi - real photon ( @xmath4 ) is emitted by the incoming electron or positron , and interacts with the proton .",
    "such a photon has a hadronic component , which can be assigned a partonic structure . at leading order ( lo ) in qcd ,",
    "two types of process take part in photoproduction : direct photon processes , where the photon couples as a point - like particle to a parton from the proton , and resolved photon processes , where one of the partons in the photon scatters on a parton in the proton .",
    "the light quark structure of the photon has been extensively studied in photon - photon collisions at @xmath5 storage rings  @xcite , whilst there is little information at present on the charm content of the photon .",
    "hera jet studies have shown some sensitivity to the gluon content of the photon  @xcite , which is still poorly known . in this paper",
    "we present a study of charm photoproduction . here , the direct process is photon - gluon fusion , @xmath6 , while charm quarks in the parton distributions of the photon and the proton can lead to processes of the type @xmath7 , known as charm flavour excitation .",
    "the photoproduction of heavy quarks such as charm can be calculated using perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) with a hard scale given by the heavy quark mass or by the high transverse momentum of the produced partons .",
    "two types of qcd nlo calculations are available for comparison with measurements of charm photoproduction .",
    "the massive charm approach  @xcite assumes that gluons and light quarks ( u , d , s ) are the only active partons within the proton and the photon , so that charm is only produced dynamically in the hard process . in the massless charm approach  @xcite charm",
    "is treated as an additional active flavour .",
    "the massive approach is expected to be superior for @xmath8 while the massless one is expected to describe the data better for @xmath9  @xcite , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the transverse momentum and mass of the charm quark . in nlo calculations , direct and resolved components",
    "can not be unambiguously separated .",
    "the massless charm calculations take into account charm excitation processes and thus predict , for a given factorisation scale , a larger resolved component in comparison with the massive calculation .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to compare the predictions of these models to data and to investigate the sensitivity of the experimental results to the partonic content of the photon and specifically to the charm excitation contribution .    in the analysis described in this paper ,",
