    "in the last ten years , much attention has been paid to understandings and applications of systems exhibiting electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite .",
    "eit is a powerful technique that can be used to make an otherwise absorbing medium transparent to a probe laser on resonance with a certain atomic transition by applying a coupling laser under the circumstances , while retaining the large and desirable nonlinear optical properties associated with the resonant response of the medium .",
    "preparation of matter in such an eit state would provide us with a new type of optical material of interest both its own right , and in many applications to fundamental and applied physics .",
    "there has been a large number of theoretical contributions in nonlinear optics using eit @xcite .",
    "the essence of eit nonlinear optics is to create strongly - coupled raman coherence for a three - level system and to control optical responses of the system .",
    "eit has been observed in several different experimental configurations @xcite .",
    "recently , considerable attention has been drawn to slow group velocities of light and high nonlinearities in the conditions of eit .",
    "extremely slow group velocities of light pulses have been observed in bose - einstein condensate of ultracold sodium atoms @xcite , in an optically dense hot rubidium gas @xcite , in rubidium vapor with slow ground state relaxation @xcite , and in crystals doped by rare - earth ions @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the condition of ultrslow light propagation leads to photon switching at an energy cost of one photon per event @xcite and to efficient nonlinear processes at energies of a few photons per atomic cross section @xcite .",
    "a giant cross - kerr nonlinearity in eit was suggested by schmidt and imamolu @xcite , and has been indirectly measured in the experiment @xcite .",
    "more recently , two groups @xcite have independently realized light storage in atomic mediums by using eit technique .",
    "theoretically there are two formalisms to treat eit .",
    "one is adiabatic eit @xcite in which both probe and coupling resonant lasers are adiabatically applied .",
    "after the system reaches a steady state , eit occurs for arbitrary intensities of the probe and coupling lasers .",
    "the other is transient - state eit @xcite . in this case ,",
    "resonant probe and coupling lasers are simultaneously applied .",
    "eit happens only when the intensity of the coupling laser is much larger than that of the probe .",
    "conventionally , both coupling and probe lasers were treated as classical , external fields .",
    "a disadvantage of the external field approach is that it can not deal with atom - photon and photon - photon quantum entanglement which is of importance not only because of the fundamental physics involved , but also for their potential technological applications such as quantum computation and quantum communication @xcite .",
    "recent studies on eit have indicated that the possibility to coherently control the propagations of quantum probe light pulses in atomic media .",
    "this opens up interesting applications such as quantum state memories , generation of squeezed and entangled atomic states , quantum information processing , and as narrow - band sources of nonclassical radiation .",
    "in particular , with a quantum treatment of the probe laser , fleischhauer and lukin @xcite have recently been able to predict the formation of dark - state polaritons in the propagation of light pulses through quantum entanglement of atomic and probe - photon states .",
    "this has been confirmed in the latest light storage experiments @xcite .",
    "this lesson teaches us that the quantum description of laser is more fundamental than the classical one , having advantages in uncovering new effects involving quantum nature of photons .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we have developed a fully quantum treatment of eit in a vapor of three - level @xmath0-type atoms .",
    "both the probe and coupling lasers with arbitrary intensities are quantized , and treated on the same footing .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study the linear and nonlinear optical properties of an adiabatic eit system interacting with two quantized fields and investigate the response of the eit medium to nonclassical light fields .",

    "ii , we set up our model and give an adiabatic solution of the full hamiltonian . in sec .",
    "iii and iv , we investigate the linear and nonlinear optical properties of the eit system . in sec .",
    "v , we discuss the response of the eit medium to nonclassical light fields . finally , we summarize our results and make concluding remarks in sec . vi .",

    "we now discuss the influence of non - classical light on atomic polarization .",
    "allowing such a study is one of the advantages of our fully quantum treatment of both the coupling and the probe laser fields .",
    "we assume that initially the atom is in the ground state , two laser fields in an arbitrary state @xmath207     the fourier component of the optical coherence at probe - laser frequency is then given by @xmath208 which indicates that the atomic polarization depends upon the single - photon coherence of the initial probe field , i.e. , @xmath209 .",
    "hence , the atomic polarization is zero , if the probe filed is initially in a state of no single - photon coherence .",
    "this point can be understood by the following argument .",
    "the polarization is produced by the electric field .",
    "when the probe field is initially in a state of no single - photon coherence , the mean value of the electric field in the state vanishes , therefore the polarization of the medium is zero . when the coupling and probe lasers are in the coherent state @xmath210 , eq .",
    "( [ e59 ] ) reduces to eq .",
    "( [ e15 ] ) in the large-@xmath71 approximation .",
    "obviously , the large-@xmath71 approximation should be given up to investigate on the response of the eit medium to nonclassical laser fields .",
    "in conclusion we have studied the linear and nonlinear optical properties of eit medium interacting with two quantized laser fields for the adiabatic eit case in terms of a time - independent approach in which both probe and coupling lasers are included as parts of the dynamical system under our consideration , and treated on the same footing .",
    "it has been shown that the fully - quantized treatment for both probe and coupling lasers can not only describes the ultraslow light experiments @xcite very well , but also sheds new insight for the response of eit media to nonclassical laser fields .",
    "in fact , we have found that very good agreement with experimental results for slow group velocities and the nonlinear refractive index of the probe laser observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "we have shown that eit medium exhibits normal dispersion .",
    "we have investigated the group velocities of both probe and coupling lasers in adiabatic eit media .",
    "it has been found that the group velocities of both probe and coupling lasers are reduced .",
    "it should be pointed out that there are conditions for achieving slow group velocities of both probe and coupling lasers . in the perturbation regime",
    ", the weak - probe - strong - coupling - laser configuration leads to the fact that only the probe laser have significantly reduced group velocity . when using a strong - probe - strong - coupling - laser configuration , one transfers appreciable population to the excited state @xmath211 at the early stage of the pulse .",
    "this is the familiar coherent population transfer stage . after this stage ,",
    "both probe and coupling lasers take dual role : they both work partly as a probe and partly as a control laser .",
    "the consequence is that both will experience slow down .",
    "we have studied refractive - index changes of both probe and coupling lasers in the vicinity of the resonance .",
    "we have also calculated nonlinear susceptibilities and nonlinear refractive - index coefficients in a completely analytical form .",
    "we have indicated that eit medium exhibits giant resonantly enhanced nonlinearities .",
    "we have discussed the response of the eit medium to nonclassical light fields , and indicated that the polarization vanishes when the probe laser is initially in a nonclassical state of no single - photon coherence .    finally , it should be remarked that in our treatment of eit , which incorporates both probe and coupling lasers as part of the dynamical system , the decay parameters of various levels are ignored .",
    "this is a good approximation , since eit is insensitive to any possible decay of the top level @xmath4 : during the adiabatic preparation the population of the level @xmath4 in the dressed state @xmath212 remains negligibly small ; see eqs .",
    "( [ e6 ] ) and ( [ e8 ] ) .",
    "even if we add by hand an imaginary part to the energy of the level @xmath4 , it will _ not _ enter the energy eigenvalue for the drssed state @xmath212 .",
    "moreover , the effects of other decay parameters are expected to depend only on their ratios to @xmath134 or @xmath213 , which normally are too small to dramatically change our results .",
