    "the exact , nonlocal form for the many - electron fock exchange energy is known from hartree - fock theory .",
    "however , it is a standard practice in density functional theory ( dft ) to compute this energy by integrating a local energy density per electron that is specified by the local electron density and its derivatives .",
    "one of the most popular of these semilocal density approximations is the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) model@xcite .",
    "accuracy can be improved by mixing the pbe exchange energy with a fraction of the exact nonlocal fock exchange energy , producing hybrid functionals such as pbe0@xcite .",
    "exchange mixing can also depend on distance : the heyd - scuseria - ernzerhof ( hse ) density functional@xcite retains only short - range fock exchange and preserves the accuracy of pbe0 while avoiding the cost and pathologies@xcite of long - range fock exchange . unlike in traditional kohn - sham theory , hybrid functionals generate nonlocal potentials , which is described by a generalized kohn - sham ( gks ) theory@xcite . ideally , an exact gks functional can produce both a highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) and a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) that have orbital energies equivalent to the negative ionization potential ( ip ) and electron affinity ( ea ) , respectively . in practice , hse and other short - range fock",
    "exchange functionals are accurate for band gaps ( ip+ea ) of semiconductors@xcite , but fail significantly for large - gap insulators@xcite , molecules@xcite , interfaces@xcite , and nanostructures@xcite .",
    "the hse functional form defines a 2-dimensional space of dft functionals@xcite , set by the fraction of fock exchange , @xmath0 , at zero electron separation and a length scale , @xmath1 , on which the short - range fock exchange is computed , @xmath2 the short - range fock exchange ( in hartrees ) is calculated using the spinful kohn - sham density matrix @xmath3 , @xmath4 while the long - range and remaining short - range exchange are derived from the exchange - hole formulation of pbe@xcite .",
    "the intent of hse was to achieve accuracy equivalent to pbe0 , therefore the exchange fraction was limited to its pbe0 value of @xmath5 .",
    "the hse06 reparameterization of the hse form@xcite was also based on a variation of @xmath6 and not @xmath0 .",
    "the remaining @xmath7 space has been explored only sparsely@xcite with results suggesting that different choices of @xmath6 and @xmath0 improve the accuracy of different physical properties .",
    "hse is not the first density functional to combine a short - range fragment of fock exchange with a semilocal model of long - range exchange .",
    "the concept has appeared previously as screened exchange ( sx ) by bylander and kleinman@xcite , where a combination of short - range fock exchange and the local density approximation ( lda ) of correlation and long - range exchange , denoted@xcite sx - lda , was used to improve lda band gaps of semiconductors .",
    "this application of short - range fock exchange to band gap estimation is motivated by the coulomb - hole - plus - screened - exchange ( cohsex ) approximation to electron quasiparticle theory@xcite in combination with the thomas - fermi model of screening .",
    "based on this motivation , an @xmath8 screening factor is used in place of @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ sx ] ) and the fock exchange fraction is set to unity ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the difference in screening form is insignificant , since the two variants can approximate each other , @xmath11 with a maximum pointwise error of @xmath12 ( see fig .",
    "[ screen ] ) .",
    "however , hse uses a single @xmath6 parameter for all systems , while the @xmath13 parameter in sx - lda is set to the thomas - fermi screening length based on average valence electron density @xmath14 ( in atomic units ) , @xmath15 system - dependence of the fock exchange length scale is the most important difference between hse and sx - lda , especially because @xmath14 is not well - defined for a molecule without an arbitrary definition of molecular volume .",

    "both functions are displayed in the upper panel and their difference is displayed in the lower panel . ]",
    "given the flexibility of the hse form , we fully explore the @xmath7 parameter space to determine if its accuracy and efficiency can be improved further . also , we assess the variation in results over this space to explain why hse is accurate and reveal its unresolved shortcomings .",
    "first , we search for a `` sx - pbe '' functional in hse space that reproduces the performance of sx - lda , which we define by setting @xmath16 and optimizing @xmath6 for band gap estimation . despite the use of a system - independent @xmath6 instead of a system - dependent @xmath13 ,",
    "sx - pbe is able to surpass the accuracy of sx - lda .",
    "this can be explained by the small degree of variation in @xmath13 values .",
    "next , we search for a `` hse12 '' parameterization that minimizes the overall error over multiple test sets .",
    "the result is a modest improvement over the hse06 parameterization , which comes from using a larger fock exchange fraction ( @xmath17 ) . finally , we search for a range - minimized `` hse12s '' parameterization that minimizes the value of @xmath1 while preserving the accuracy of hse06 .",
    "this results in reduction of @xmath1 by a factor of two , which can reduce the cost of evaluating eq .",
    "( [ sx ] ) by reducing the number of @xmath18 off - diagonals that need to be computed to achieve a target accuracy . after evaluating multiple tests sets ,",
    "we observe significantly different behavior in two quantities : molecular ips and eas as approximated by homo and lumo energies .",
    "we can explain this phenomenon as a fundamental limitation of the hse functional form that results from the use of an environment - independent and homogeneous screening of exchange that is unable to account for inhomogeneous screening environments .",

    "fully sampled fock exchange is applied as an additional perturbative correction to the band gap@xcite .",
    "minor modifications to the current version of vasp are required to calculate the 3 sx - lda variants considered in this paper@xcite .",
    "comparing dft results to experiments may require finite temperature and quantum nuclear corrections that are not typically included within dft itself .",

    "this can have a large effect on band gaps , but the sc/40 test set@xcite that we utilize has removed large spin - orbit effects from its experimental values .",
    "error distributions are quantified using the mean error ( me ) with a ( theory - experiment ) sign convention , the mean absolute error ( mae ) , and the root - mean - square error ( rmse ) .",

    "unpleasant and unsurprising@xcite are the large discrepancies between @xmath35scf and eigenvalue estimates of small molecule ips and eas , which we argue to originate from the absence of environment - dependent screening in the hse functional resulting from discrepancies between @xmath36 in eq .",
