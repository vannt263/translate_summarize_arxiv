    "in order to understand the basic mechanisms of a growth process , it is a common practice to associate it to a certain universality class @xcite .",
    "this is usually done with the calculation of scaling exponents of surface roughness and assuming that family - vicsek scaling is valid @xcite ( with a suitable generalization when anomalous scaling holds ) .",
    "however , huge corrections to scaling make this calculation difficult in finite - size systems , both for simulation work and for the analysis of images of real surfaces .",
    "these problems and the interest in finding more universal properties of growth processes motivated recent studies of other quantities , such as the distributions of surface roughness @xcite .",
    "most efforts were devoted to calculation of those distributions in steady states ( roughness saturation ) , but the comparison of distributions obtained under conditions that parallel experimental work ( the so - called window boundary conditions ) is also a promising tool @xcite .    it is expected that roughness distributions scale as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the probability density of the roughness @xmath5 of a given configuration to lie in the range @xmath6 $ ] , @xmath7 is a scaling function , the overbars denote spatial averages and the angular brackets denote configurational averages .",
    "( [ deff ] ) is usually obtained in analytical work , such as in the calculation of distributions for @xmath8-noise interfaces @xcite .",
    "an alternative scaling relation is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the root mean square ( rms ) deviation of @xmath11 .",
    "it is reasonable to claim that comparison of full roughness distributions is better than the calculation of one or two exponents to determine the class of a growth process .",
    "however , these distributions may also be deviated from the expected scaling relations by finite - size corrections .",
    "for instance , finite - size data of some models in the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) class @xcite show small deviations from relation ( [ deff ] ) , while good data collapse of numerical data for different lattice sizes is obtained with relation ( [ defg ] ) @xcite .",
    "the advantage of a scaling relation equivalent to ( [ defg ] ) was also illustrated in the study of maximal height distributions ( mhd ) of @xmath8 signals @xcite .",
    "moreover , the leading corrections to scaling in mhd of some one - dimensional solid - on - solid models were analytically predicted and numerically confirmed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which clearly shows that such corrections are not related to low accuracy of simulation data .",
    "the presence of huge scaling corrections may be much worse in distributions of other quantities , such as height distributions @xcite .    for the above reasons , investigation on the failure of finite - size scaling of roughness distributions",
    "is essential to ensure their reliability for comparison with real or model systems .",
    "moreover , understanding the reasons for the failure of an scaling relation and the advantages of other ones may also be helpful to find the form of the main finite - size corrections and to propose alternative methods of analysis .",
    "one particularly important case is kpz growth in @xmath1 dimensions , since this class contains many models with large corrections to scaling of the average roughness , such as ballistic deposition ( bd ) and eden growth , as well as a large number of applications ( see e. g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this work is to study finite - size corrections in roughness distribution scaling by analyzing numerical simulation data of various interface growth models and to discuss the possible relations with other quantities that characterize those interfaces .",
    "the numerical approach is essential to study the three - dimensional systems considered here , as well as some two - dimensional systems ( the usual systems where analytic work is possible are gaussian interfaces ) .    first , we will study a group of ballistic - like models where the deviations from relation ( [ deff ] ) are much larger than those previously found in other models @xcite .",
    "this means that no evidence on their universality class can be obtained by assuming that scaling relation . on the other hand , good collapse of large systems data",
    "is obtained with eq .",
    "( [ defg ] ) , which shows that they are actually in the kpz class . moreover",
    ", we successfully propose an alternative scaling relation accounting for the effect of the intrinsic width , which is a constant correction term previously included in the scaling of the average roughness @xcite .",
    "this shows how the main finite - size corrections may be extracted from roughness distribution scaling .",
    "however , we discard the usual interpretation that the intrinsic width is a consequence of high surface steps by analyzing data of restricted solid - on - solid ( rsos ) models , where this correction is not present . instead , we observe that the deviations from finite - size scaling in the roughness distributions are usually accompanied by significant finite - size dependence of dimensionless amplitude ratios of moments of height distributions , as well as of scaling exponents and average local slopes .",
    "this conclusion is not restricted to kpz systems , as shown in the analysis of the molecular - beam epitaxy model of das sarma and tamborenea ( dt ) @xcite in @xmath2 dimensions , which is well - known for the slow convergence of numerically estimated exponents @xcite . indeed , for this model none of the proposed scaling relations",
    "is able to produce good collapse of small systems data .",
    "although we are not able to determine all the reasons for the failure of scaling relations in a given universality class , we will show how deviations in different quantities are connected and will suggest alternative methods of analysis .",
    "this may be helpful not only in future work on complex models and real systems , but also to search for models with minimal finite - size effects , e. g. following the ideas of ref .",
    "anyway , an important conclusion is that roughness distributions are actually superior to other quantities for a reliable search of the universality class of a growing system , although it is not the final solution for all models .",
    "the rest of this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the above scaling relations and propose an alternative one for cases where intrinsic width is expected . in sec .",
    "iii we present the discrete models analyzed in the subsequent sections and the equations defining their universality classes . in secs .",
    "iv , v and vi , we discuss the finite - size effects in the roughness distributions , the role of local slopes and the finite - size effects in the height distributions , respectively . in sec .",
    "vii we summarize our results and present our conclusions .",
    "if the scaling relation ( [ deff ] ) holds , the function @xmath12 is a function of the variable @xmath13 .",
    "the moment of order @xmath14 of this function is defined as @xmath15 , so that the first moments are given by @xmath16 this means that any finite - size dependence of the ratio @xmath17 ( between the average square roughness and its rms fluctuation ) will lead to a finite - size dependence of the second moment . however , in the scaling relation ( [ defg ] ) , @xmath18 is a function of the variable @xmath19 , so that the first moments of @xmath20 are @xmath21 this means that the finite - size dependence of @xmath22 do not lead to deviations in the second moment of this scaling function , leaving possible corrections to the third moment .    in works based on data collapse methods ,",
    "the fluctuations in the first few moments of a scaling function are the ones most easily related to visual deviations of the plots of data from different system sizes . consequently , scaling relation ( [ defg ] ) is expected to be better than ( [ deff ] ) by avoiding that finite - size effects are reflected in its second moment .",
    "this was already observed for some kpz models in @xmath1 dimensions in relatively small system sizes @xcite .",
    "recent work on maximal height distributions of @xmath8 signals also illustrated this feature and stressed the fact that finite - size scaling of the higher cumulants was related to the deviations @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the particular properties of a growth model is certainly important to guide the proposal of suitable scaling relations .",
    "for instance , this was the case of a recent work on elastic lines in random environments , in which the scaling relation ( [ deff ] ) was generalized to incorporate time and temperature effects @xcite . here",
    ", we will consider a series of ballistic - like models whose deposits contain holes and overhangs , among other steep features , thus our approach is based on properties of related models",
    ".    simulation work on models which produce deposits with holes and overhangs , such as the eden model , suggested that the leading correction to the scaling of the average squared roughness is a constant term @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of the average squared roughness , starting from a flat interface , obeys @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a constant called the intrinsic width , @xmath25 is the roughness exponents and @xmath26 is the dynamic exponent .",
    "the usual interpretation of relation ( [ fv ] ) is that the first term at the right - hand side ( the original family - vicsek relation @xcite ) is associated with fluctuations of all wavelengths , while the intrinsic width is thought to be related to short wavelength features , represented by overhangs , holes and high steps at the film surface - see e. g. refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the present work is only concerned with steady state properties , where @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ fv ] ) and the saturation roughness [ @xmath28 scales as @xmath29 with @xmath30 constant .",
    "large values of @xmath24 are responsible for remarkable deviations of finite - size estimates of exponent @xmath25 from its asymptotic value .",
    "however , numerical work on ballistic - like models show that finite - size corrections to the scaling of @xmath31 are smaller than the corrections in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "these results lead us to propose that , for the ballistic - like models , the roughness of a given interface configuration is a sum of a fluctuating value , which is distributed according to the universality class of the model , and a constant contribution , which is the intrinsic width . following this reasoning , we change relation ( [ deff ] ) by subtracting a constant from @xmath11 and @xmath0 : @xmath32 here @xmath33 must be viewed as a fitting constant and @xmath34 is a scaling function .",
    "the first moments of the function @xmath35 , where @xmath36 , are @xmath37    if our assumptions are correct and @xmath33 is chosen to match the intrinsic width @xmath24 , then the finite - size dependence of the second moment @xmath38 will be cancelled , or at least it will be greatly reduced .",
    "consequently , the quality of a data collapse plot will be similar to that based on eq .",
    "( [ defg ] ) .",
    "certainly this proposal has to be validated by numerical ( or eventually analitic ) work , and it is also important to notice that it is independent on the particular interpretation given to the intrinsic width .",

    "@xcite , but here we will consider an extension of that model that has the same symmetries and , consequently , belong to the same universality class . in this generalized crsos model @xcite , hereafter simply called crsos , if the column of incidence does not obey the above condition for aggregation , with @xmath40 , then the incident particle executes random walks among neighboring columns until finding a position where it is satisfied and aggregation can occur .    in the @xmath43 model @xcite ,",
    "the arriving particle sticks at the top of the column of incidence if it has one or two lateral neighbors at that position .",
    "otherwise , the neighboring columns are consulted and if one of them satisfies that condition , then the incident particle aggregates at that point . however , if no neighboring column satisfies the condition , then the particle sticks at the top of the column of incidence , and if both neighboring columns satisfy the condition , then one of them is randomly chosen .",
    "the grain deposition models studied here were introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite for the study of a crossover in local roughness scaling similar to experimental systems .",
    "they are defined in a simple cubic lattice where the length unit is the lattice parameter .",
    "the grains have cubic shapes and lateral size @xmath44 .",
    "they sequentially incide perperdicularly to an initially flat substrate , with two of their faces parallel to the substrate .",
    "the incident grain permanently aggregates to the deposit when its bottom touches a previously aggregated grain ( thus , there is no lateral aggregation ) .",
    "the process is shown in fig . 1",
    ". here we will simulate the model with grain sizes ranging from @xmath45 to @xmath46 . despite the different aggregation rules , the grain deposition models and the bd model form the group to which hereafter we will refer as ballistic - like models .",
    "the symmetries of the ballistic - like models and of the rsos models indicate that they are in the kpz universality class ( see e. g. the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the continuous description of the growth process is provided by the kpz equation @xmath47 here , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are constants , @xmath50 is a gaussian noise with zero mean and variance @xmath51 , with @xmath52 constant , and @xmath53 is the dimension of the substrate . in the following sections , we will study those models in @xmath1 dimensions ( in @xmath2 dimensions , some exact results and highly accurate numerical results are already available ) .",
    "the dt and the crsos models in @xmath2 dimensions are in the class of the nonlinear fourth order growth equation @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are constants .",
    "this is also known as villain - lai - das sarma ( vlds ) equation @xcite , and the discrete models are said to belong to the vlds class .",
    "the dt model is particularly interesting in @xmath2 dimensions due to the presence of strong finite - size corrections which leads to exponents estimates far from the vlds values ( although noise reduction methods are able to provide estimates closer to the vlds ones @xcite ) .    for all models , only steady state properties will be studied in this work .",
    "the roughness distributions are typically obtained from @xmath57 to @xmath58 different configurations , and height distributions from a number of configurations which is larger by a factor @xmath59 ( the square of the lattice size ) .",
    "in order to compare the roughness distributions of the above models , we use two of them as representatives of their growth classes : the rsos model with @xmath40 , whose distribution hereafter will be referred as the rsos / kpz one ( @xmath1 dimensions , @xmath60 ) , and the crsos model with @xmath61 , whose distribution hereafter will be referred as the crsos / vlds one ( @xmath2 dimensions , @xmath60 ) .",
    "the use of these models data as standards is possible because previous work have already shown that they have very small finite - size dependence @xcite .",

    "we observe deviations from data collapse with sizes smaller than those shown in figs .",

    "the ratios between the leading correction ( @xmath33 ) and the dominant term @xmath76 are very large for all model , in some cases exceeding @xmath77 , which quantitatively confirm the strong finite - size effects .    however , it is important to notice that the scaling with eq .",

    "the intrinsic width is usually associated to steep surface features , such as large local slopes , holes and overhangs . in order to test this hypothesis",
    ", it is interesting to consider other models which also have large local slopes .",
    "this is the case , for instance , of the rsos models with large @xmath78 .    in figs . 5a and",

    "finally , we analyze the dt model in @xmath2 dimensions . in figs .",
    "6a and 6b we show the roughness distributions for that model in lattice sizes @xmath81 and @xmath62 , scaled according to eqs .",
    "( [ deff ] ) and ( [ defg ] ) .",
    "no significant finite - size effect is found in the scaling with the fluctuation @xmath31 ( fig .",
    "however , both plots show that the distribution of the dt model is very different from the crsos / vlds distribution in @xmath2 dimensions ( @xmath60 ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is no evidence that the former will converge to the crsos / vlds curve as @xmath65 increases .",
    "we observe the same large deviations when the dt distributions are scaled according to eq.([defh ] ) for several values of the constant @xmath33 .",
    "thus , the assumption of an intrinsic width is not sufficient to represent the main finite - size effects in that model , at least in the accessible range for simulation , which is @xmath82 .",
    "however , previous work showed that simulation of noise - reduced dt models provides estimates of scaling exponents closer to the vlds values @xcite .",
    "thus , we also calculated the dt distributions using noise - reduction parameters @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 . here , @xmath86 is the number of times that a certain column has to be chosen for aggregation of a new particle before the aggregation actually takes place @xcite . in fig .",
    "6c we show the scaled distributions for these models in @xmath81 , which converge to the crsos / vlds curve as @xmath86 increases ( although reasonable data collapse is not obtained in the tails ) .",
    "this noise - reduction scheme is not expected to change the universality class of the process because symmetries are preserved ( see e. g. the discussion in ref .",
    "thus , the above changes in the distributions when the parameter @xmath86 is increased ( fig .",
    "6c ) are evidence that the asymptotic behavior of the dt distribution was not attained yet .",
    "consequently , the above discrepancies with the crsos / vlds curve do not mean that the dt model does not belong to the vlds class , but only that the finite - size effects on the roughness distributions have much more complex forms than those suggested here .",
    "indeed , we recall that ref . @xcite derived the vlds equation from the master equation of the dt model in @xmath2 dimension .    in the following sections",
    ", we will show that finite - size corrections obtained here in the roughness distributions are accompannied by corrections in other quantities .",
    "here we characterize the interfaces at small lengthscales by the average squared height difference between nearest neighbor columns , @xmath87 , also calculated at the steady states .",
    "our main aim is to test the hypothesis that the intrinsic width is related to local height fluctuations of the interface .    in the ballistic - like models",
    ", @xmath88 has a significant finite - size dependence for small lattice sizes .",
    "however , it is approximately constant in the largest lattice sizes analyzed for each @xmath44 in sec .",
    "iii ( the same sizes used to collapse the roughness distributions ) .",
    "however , in the rsos models @xmath88 attains a saturation value for very small system sizes .    in fig .",
    "7 we plot the correction term @xmath33 obtained in the scaling with eq . [ defh ] ( i. e. the intrinsic width ) as a function of the large @xmath65 value of @xmath88 for both groups of models .",
    "the result for the ballistic - like models could naively suggest that the intrinsic width was only related to local height fluctuations .",
    "however , the result for the rsos models show this interpretation is not valid in general : @xmath80 in that case and the values of @xmath88 are in the same range of those for ballistic - like models with @xmath89 .",
    "in the dt model in @xmath2 dimensions , we observe a rapid increase of the average local slope with the lattice size : @xmath90 for @xmath79 , @xmath91 for @xmath81 , and @xmath92 for @xmath62 . a comparison with @xmath88 for the other models shown in fig .",
    "7 is not possible because we are not able to perform a reliable extrapolation of these data to @xmath93 . on the other hand ,",
    "these data confirm that the dt model is very far from its asymptotic limit ( the continuum vlds model ) in this range of lattice sizes .",
    "the above results suggest that the presence of large fluctuations at small lengthscales is insufficient to explain the intrinsic width as the main correction term of roughness scaling in the ballistic - like models , since this is also a property of models which have much weaker scaling corrections ( the rsos ones ) .",
    "on the other hand , we observe that finite - size effects on roughness distributions are accompannied by the same type of effect on @xmath87 .",
    "finite - size effects in height distributions are typically larger than those in roughness distributions , as illustrated for kpz models in ref . @xcite . thus , in order to study finite - size effects on steady state height distributions , the best procedure is to compare their skewness @xmath94 and kurtosis @xmath95 in different lattice sizes ( other previous works which aimed at characterizing height distributions also focused on those quantities - see e.g. refs .",
    "they are defined from the moments of the height distributions , @xmath96 , as @xmath97 and @xmath98    the sign of the skewness indicates which type of singular feature is dominant at the interface : deep valleys or grooves lead to negative @xmath94 , while sharp peaks give positive @xmath94 . in kpz models the sign of @xmath94 is the same of the coefficient of the nonlinear term @xmath99 of the corresponding kpz equation ( see e. g. the discussion in ref .",

    "@xcite . in figs . 8a and 8b ,",
    "the variable @xmath102 was used in the abscissa because it is the one which provides the best linear fits among other variables of the form @xmath103 , with one digit variation in @xmath104 .",
    "since the asymptotic values of @xmath94 and @xmath95 are not known exactly , as well as their finite - size corrections , such numerical extrapolations are necessary .",
    "we observe very weak finite - size corrections in the rsos data , so that a simple extrapolation procedure to @xmath93 ( @xmath105 ) leads to an asymptotic estimate of @xmath94 in agreement with the best known value @xmath106 of the kpz class @xcite . however , there are large finite - size corrections in the data for the bd model .",
    "it is remarkable that up to @xmath107 , the skewness of bd is negative , while the values for larger @xmath65 are positive .",
    "the finite - size dependence of the data for the grain deposition model is much stronger : only for @xmath108 the skewness crosses over from negative to positive values .",
    "the change in sign of @xmath94 of the ballistic - like models shows that the typical steady state configurations for small @xmath65 are very different from the typical ones for large @xmath65 .",
    "in other words , the steady states for small @xmath65 are not representative of the asymptotic limit of the model ( large @xmath65 and @xmath109 ) , which is the kpz limit .",
    "for the grain deposition model with @xmath46 , even the steady state for @xmath67 has @xmath110 and , consequently , is very far from the kpz limit .",
    "despite these problems , the data for the bd ballistic - like models indicate that @xmath94 is positive when @xmath93 .",
    "asymptotic estimates ( not very accurate ) of @xmath94 can be obtained from extrapolations of those data ; they are not very distant from the best known values for kpz in @xmath1 dimensions",

    "the values of @xmath94 and @xmath95 for the dt and the crsos models are shown in figs . 9a and 9b as a function of @xmath102 .",
    "they were estimated up to @xmath60 for the dt model ( this work ) and up to @xmath66 for the crsos model ( ref .",

    "the variable in the abscissa was chosen by analogy with fig .",

    "however , it is clear that the data for the dt model in fig .",
    "9a do not converge to the same value , even if the sign of @xmath94 is changed ( the actual sign of @xmath94 is related to that of @xmath56 in eq .",
    "[ vlds ] ) .",
    "there is also no evidence that the kurtosis of the dt model will converge to the same value of the crsos model .",
    "thus , the height distributions of the dt model up to @xmath60 are not representative of the vlds class , even if we account for simple finite - size corrections .",
    "the overall conclusion from the above results is that small or large finite - size corrections are simultaneously present in roughness and height distributions , but the convergence of roughness distributions to the asymptotic limit is certainly much better when it occurs , as illustrated with the ballistic - like models .",
    "the amplitude ratios of height distributions are interesting to show that , when the corrections are large , the finite - size configurations of hills and valleys are not representative of the universality class of the model .",
    "we are not able to explain why the roughness distributions ( for large @xmath65 ) represent the correct class of the model when the height distributions do not , but certainly there is no contradiction in this finding because we are comparing distributions of local and global quantities , whose scaling properties may be very different .",
    "for various interface growth models , height and roughness distributions and average square neighboring heights differences @xmath112 were numerically calculated in the steady states , in order to analyze their finite - size effects .",
    "first , we considered a group of ballistic - like deposition models in which the most typical scaling relation for roughness distributions ( eq . [ deff ] ) fails to provide collapse of finite - size systems data . on the other hand ,",
    "good data collapse was obtained with a scaling relation involving the roughness fluctuation ( eq .",
    "[ defg ] ) and with an alternative relation which includes the effect of the intrinsic width .",
    "this shows that this constant term is the main correction to the asymptotic kpz distribution , thus extending previous work which suggested that quantity only as a correction to the scaling of the average roughness .",
    "the comparison with other models with large @xmath113 ( the rsos ones ) show that the average local slope is not sufficient to explain the intrinsic width , in contrast to previous interpretation .",
    "height distributions for those models also show strong finite - size effects , although results for sufficiently large lattice sizes indicate convergence of amplitude ratios to the expected asymptotic values .",
    "we also studied the model of das sarma and tamborenea ( dt ) in @xmath2 dimensions .",
    "its roughness distributions up to size @xmath62 are very different from the ones representative of the asymptotic vlds class .",
    "strong finite - size effects are also observed in skewness and kurtosis of height distributions and in @xmath88 , with no evidence of convergence to reliable asymptotic values .",
    "our results show that the deviations from finite - size scaling in the roughness distributions are usually accompanied by significant finite - size dependence of dimensionless amplitude ratios of moments of height distributions and of average local slopes .",
    "one important point is that this conclusion is not restricted to the kpz class .",
    "the analysis of simple quantities , such as @xmath113 , is useful to search for finite - size effects and may reveal slow convergence to a continuum limit .",
    "in some situations ( e. g. the dt model here ) , this convergence may be so slow that no one of the quantities analyzed here are able to show the correct class of the growth process . in the other cases , roughness distributions are certainly better than other quantities ( including scaling exponents ) to classify the process .",
