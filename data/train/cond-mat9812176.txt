    "<S> we present a study of both the `` iterative procedure '' and the `` @xmath0 transformation '' , proposed by tsallis et al ( _ physica * a261 * , 534 _ ) to find the probabilities @xmath1 of a system to be in a state with energy @xmath2 , within the framework of a generalized statistical mechanics . using stability and convexity arguments </S>",
    "<S> , we argue that the iterative procedure does not always provide the right temperature dependence of thermodynamic observables . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we show how to get the correct answers from the `` @xmath3 transformation '' . </S>",
    "<S> our results provide an evidence that the tsallis statistics with normalized q - expectation values is stable for all ranges of temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the cut - off in the computation of probabilities is required to achieve the stable solutions </S>",
    "<S> .    generalized thermodynamics . non - extensive systems . tsallis statistics .    </S>",
    "<S> the study of alternatives to the boltzmann - gibbs statistics has arisen increasing interest on the last years . among several proposals , </S>",
    "<S> the most widely used and studied has been the so - called `` tsallis statistics''@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this new formulation seems to be appropriate for the study of non - extensive systems @xcite . the list of non - extensive systems , and that are reported as candidates to obey the tsallis statistics , is growing fast . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the understanding of the basic principles and properties of this non - extensive statistics has gain fundamental importance . in this direction </S>",
    "<S> a recent work by tsallis , mendes and plastino @xcite covers the role of constraints within the tsallis statistics . in that work </S>",
    "<S> , they study three different alternatives for the internal energy constraint . </S>",
    "<S> the first two choices correspond to the ones which have been applied to many different systems in the last years @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they are : ( ia ) @xmath4 and ( ib ) @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> however , both constraints present undesirable difficulties . a third choice for the internal energy constraint is considered by them @xcite ,    @xmath6    where @xmath7 comes from the entropy definition @xcite    @xmath8    with @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a given state with energy @xmath2 from @xmath11 possible states . </S>",
    "<S> each constraint ( ia),(ib ) and eq.([constrain ] ) determines a different set of probabilities @xmath1 for each state with energy @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the extremization of the generalized entropy ( [ sq ] ) , under constraint [ constrain ] gives us an implicit equation for the probabilities @xmath1 :    @xmath12^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}/z_q\\label{piq}\\ ] ]    with    @xmath13^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}\\ ] ]    the normalized q - expectation value of an observable is therefore defined as    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is any observable which commutes with the hamiltonian - otherwise we should use make use of the density operator @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> we will refer to this reformulation of the tsallis statistics as `` with normalized q - expectation values '' .    in order to solve equation [ piq ] tsallis _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ suggest two different approaches , namely the _ iterative procedure _ and the _ @xmath17 transformation_. in the iterative procedure , we start with an initial set of probabilities and iterate them self - consistently until the desirable precision is reached . in the @xmath17 transformation </S>",
    "<S> the set of equations above is transformed to :    @xmath18^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}/z'_{q } \\\\\\ ] ]    @xmath19^ { \\frac{1}{1-q}}}\\\\\\ ] ]    with    @xmath20    in order to obtain @xmath21 , we go through the following steps :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> compute the quantities @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   if @xmath23 them @xmath24 ; 3 .   compute @xmath25 ; 4 .   </S>",
    "<S> compute @xmath26 ; 5 .   obtain @xmath27 and any other thermodynamical quantities using equation 5 ; 6 .   </S>",
    "<S> obtain @xmath28 from equation ( [ betabetaast ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> this recipe allows the determination of @xmath29 for all @xmath28 and consequently @xmath30 ( and any other observable ) . </S>",
    "<S> the second step in the above procedure is the well known ( and useful ) cut - off @xcite associated to _ `` vanishing probabilities''_. this cut - off is needed only for @xmath31 . because the cut - off is applied before the computation of the probabilities , the norm constraint is still respected .    in ref.@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the authors illustrate their ideas by applying them to a system with discrete spectrum @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath35 we have the case of two non - degenerate levels . the limit @xmath36 corresponds to the quantum harmonic oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 in that paper presents the results for the internal energy @xmath37 , as a function of the temperature , for both procedures . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath38 transformation generates a non - physical reentrant behavior whereas the iterative procedure produces a discontinuity in the free energy . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that the system might be unstable . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we need to figure out the relation between both approaches . </S>",
    "<S> we show , through a simple example , how to get rid of the reentrant region and consequently that the tsallis statistics with q - normalized expectation values is stable for all @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> this evidence is specially important because theoretical arguments for stability similar to the ones previously used @xcite are very difficult ( if at all possible ) to be obtained from the implicit equation ( [ piq ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider the same system as tsallis _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ : a system with discrete spectrum @xmath40 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on @xmath31 since for @xmath41 no stability problems occur . </S>",
    "<S> we start by computing the generalized free energy , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 , for a two level system . in figure </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) we present the free energy @xmath44 , as obtained from both procedures , as a function of the normalized temperature @xmath45 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure ( 1 ) shows us that the iterative procedure gives a free energy curve with a jump . </S>",
    "<S> the jumps will appear at different temperatures if we take different initial conditions due to a feature of the iterative method of solving non - linear equations : the system tends to go to the nearest solution . </S>",
    "<S> the states that are reached for only one of the two paths shown in figure ( 1 ) should correspond to metastable states . </S>",
    "<S> we should consider only the one with the lowest free energy . </S>",
    "<S> in this way , we get rid of the uncomfortable jumps : the free energy can not be discontinuous since its convexity must be guaranteed for all @xmath39 @xcite . because of the simplicity of the system treated here ( an energy spectrum with only two levels ) , it is easy to find both paths . </S>",
    "<S> however , as we are going to show in this work , it is even easier to get the correct behavior from the @xmath46 transformation .    </S>",
    "<S> the curve for the free energy from the @xmath46 transformation displays a closed loop . </S>",
    "<S> this loop deserves also a careful analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the curved line must be discarded by convexity arguments ( the specific heat would be negative @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining states are the metastable states ( the same states that were obtained from the iterative procedure ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we can also get rid of the loop by choosing always the states with the lowest energy . similar procedures and discussions can be found in @xcite and @xcite . in figure 2 </S>",
    "<S> , we show a closer look on the loops , for some values of @xmath7 . for this system </S>",
    "<S> , we find no reentrant behavior for @xmath47 .    </S>",
    "<S> the procedure we have proposed ( to look first at the free energy curve ) gives the correct behavior for the internal energy and consequently for the computation of the other thermodynamical quantities besides explaining why the iterative procedure and the @xmath46 predict different behaviors for the internal energy . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 we show the corrected curves for the internal energy as function of the temperature . for the sake of clarity , we compare this new recipe with the @xmath46 transformation . for @xmath48 we do not need to apply any further correction because there are no loops on the generalized free energy . as shown by tsallis _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , for those values of @xmath7 both procedures give the same results . </S>",
    "<S> the correct expression of the temperature transformation for a @xmath49-level system is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 . we decided to show this result for a richer system then for the simple two - level system , in order to emphasize the role of the spurious states introduced by the @xmath46 transformation .    </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ttl ]    let us address now the role of the cut - off in the stability of the statistics . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 we present the free energy calculated with and without the cut - off for @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations are only possible for @xmath51 where @xmath52 since the exponent @xmath53 will be even . as defined in the step ( 1 ) of the @xmath46 recipe , @xmath54 might assume negative values but because they are raised to an even power , @xmath55 will be always real . without the cut - off step , </S>",
    "<S> the free energy shows an unstable concave region . </S>",
    "<S> when the cut - off is applied , the unstable region disappears . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the unstable loop does not appear due to the cut - off . </S>",
    "<S> for these special values of @xmath7 we were able to calculate the roots of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ piq ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reentrant region corresponds to three real and different roots . outside the reentrant region , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain either one real and two complex conjugated roots or a three - fold degenerate real ones .    </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cut ]    in summary , we have shown that the iterative procedure gives a non physical discontinuity in the free energy . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative procedure called `` @xmath38 transformation '' must include a more careful treatment based on free energy convexity arguments . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the standard way of choosing states with lowest free energy values allows us to get a correct internal energy temperature dependency . </S>",
    "<S> since the reentrant behavior appears from @xmath56 as function of @xmath57 , the present prescription restores the proper behavior in the temperature dependence of the thermodynamic observable . </S>",
    "<S> but the most important consequence is that the tsallis statistics with normalized q - expectation values is stable , in the sense that , for all @xmath56 , the requirements of convexity ( concavity ) for @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) in the free energy are satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> the current method has been also applied to the two - dimensional ising model in a non - extensive regime@xcite . </S>"
