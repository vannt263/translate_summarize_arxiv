    "stars form out of gas in the densest areas of molecular clouds .",
    "early studies of molecular cloud structure ( e.g.  @xcite ) concluded that a division into discrete clumps of emission was the best description . within such clumps",
    ", star formation occurs inside denser cores @xcite .",
    "a growing consensus now maintains that molecular clouds have a scale - free structure governed by turbulence ( e.g.@xcite ) , with clumps only an arbitrary categorization .",
    "we may reconcile these viewpoints to some extent ; the clump population has a power - law spectrum of mass implying the overall cloud has a similar distribution ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "equally , the self - similarity of molecular clouds must break down where gravitational collapse becomes important .",
    "this paper focusses on the decomposition of molecular clouds into _ clumps _ of emission .",
    "the utility of such a description depends on whether the located clumps accurately represent star - forming cores .",
    "clumps are typically located in either dust continuum or spectral - line datasets , which both have their own advantages and drawbacks .",
    "continuum observations select high - density cores , which tend to be self - gravitating , but associate more mass to clumps than exists in reality , since objects may be superposed along the line of sight ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "clump - finding analyses on spectral - line cubes , with their added velocity dimension , should enable clumps to be more accurately assigned but are subject to larger uncertainties from the details of the radiative transfer than continuum emission .",
    "ultimately , high signal - to - noise ratios are required in both cases for clumps to converge towards the underlying core population @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , many insights into star formation from clump populations remain compelling . @xcite",
    "first pointed out that the mass distribution of compact continuum clumps ( the clump mass distribution ; hereafter cmd ) is remarkably similar to the initial mass function of stars ( imf ) . at high masses ,",
    "the slope is consistent with a salpeter power law ( @xmath7 , @xcite ) , considerably steeper than the power law for co clumps ( @xmath8 , e.g.  @xcite ) . at lower masses ,",
    "the cmd slope becomes shallower , around the point that samples start to suffer from incompleteness .",
    "this suggests that the mass of a star is established at its earliest phases ( see also @xcite ) and would seem to rule out models where the shape of the imf is formed later , through e.g.  dynamical interactions @xcite .",
    "however , the mapping of the cmd on to the imf is not straightforward and many evolutionary schemes would fit the present data ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "many wide - field surveys are about to or have just begun , which will locate and characterize thousands of star - forming cores from continuum data , e.g.  the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) and _ herschel _ gould belt surveys @xcite .",
    "one of the key science drivers for these projects is the measurement of the cmd to high precision at low masses , into the brown - dwarf regime ( @xmath9m@xmath6 ) .",
    "thus , an examination of different source - finding techniques is particularly timely .",
    "many different methods have been deployed in the literature to locate clumps in molecular - line and continuum data , from identifications by eye to automated algorithms .",
    "however , few studies _ compare _ the sources located with different techniques ( a notable exception is @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we closely compare the populations of continuum clumps found in the perseus molecular cloud ( hereafter simply perseus ) using the two most popular automated algorithms , clfind  @xcite and gaussclumps@xcite , to highlight their differences and biases .",
    "we re - examine scuba 850  data , presented originally by @xcite , in the four clusters of cores where we have complementary harp spectral - line data @xcite , namely : ngc  1333 , ic348/hh211 ( ic348 for short ) , l1448 and l1455 .",
    "although only investigating a sub - set of the scuba data limits our sample size , these are the sources whose kinematics we will investigate subsequently and any cmds from the spectral - line data will be directly comparable ( curtis & richer , in prep . ) .",
    "the regions selected still encompass the majority of the scuba cores identified by @xcite , 58 out of 103 ; so we can extrapolate any conclusions to the entire cloud population .",
    "this work is divided into two principal parts . in section",
    "[ sec : clumppopulation ] , we identify clumps using the two algorithms before matching them to a catalogue of scuba cores , classified as protostellar or starless on the basis of their seds by @xcite ( hereafter ) .",
    "second , sections [ sec : properties ] and [ sec : cmd ] present an analysis of the physical properties of the cores before we summarize our conclusions in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "many different terminologies have been used to describe the hierarchical structure in molecular clouds ; we follow @xcite . within molecular clouds ,",
    "individual over - densities are termed _ clumps _ , these are the objects identified by automated algorithms and do not necessarily go on to form stars .",
    "clumps may contain _ cores _ , which are the direct precursors of individual or multiple stars .",
    "every clump that does not contain an embedded object is referred to as _",
    "starless_. of these starless cores , only a subset , the _ prestellar _ cores ( formerly pre - protostellar cores , @xcite ) will be gravitationally bound and thus go on to form stars .",
    "we extracted fully calibrated and reduced scuba 850  maps across the four regions in perseus we observed with harp from the data presented by @xcite , where we refer the reader for details of the observations and processing . in short , the data were taken during 20 nights between 1999 and 2003 . the sky opacity measured at 225ghz varied from @xmath10 to 0.080 , with most of the data taken in good conditions ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the beam size is 14arcsec ( 0.017pc at 250pc , our assumed distance to perseus ) and the maps are sampled on a 3arcsec grid .",
    "the rms noise level varies across the maps from typical values of @xmath12mjybeam@xmath13  in ngc  1333 and ic348 to higher values , 32 and 46mjybeam@xmath13  in l1448 and l1455 .",
    "hereafter , to be consistent with the @xcite studies and therefore allowing a direct comparison of our source catalogues , we take the noise to be @xmath14mjybeam@xmath13 , the typical value for the _ entire _ cloud .",
    "( sub)millimetre continuum mapping selects young , cold cores ( 520k ) at the earliest stages of star formation .",
    "these largely self - gravitating cores are intermediate in properties between co clumps and infrared young stellar objects ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the dust s thermal emission is optically thin nearly everywhere at these wavelengths , accurately tracing density throughout the cloud .        1 .   ` clumpfind ' or clfind  @xcite , which contours the data at evenly - spaced levels , starting close to the peak value .",
    "all distinct contiguous areas are considered above each contour level in turn .",
    "if an area has no pixels previously assigned to a clump , it is marked as a new clump .",
    "alternatively if there is a pre - existing clump assignment , that clump is extended to the next lowest contour level .",
    "when two or more different assignments exist in a area , the pixels are distributed using a friend - of - friends algorithm .",
    "gaussclumps  @xcite , which uses a least - squares fitting procedure to break - down the data into a number of gaussian - shaped clumps , in a fashion similar to the clean algorithms used in interferometric mapping .",
    "clfind  is a partitioning method with each pixel only allocated to a single clump , whereas gaussclumps  permits any number of clumps to overlap at a single spatial position .",
    "this means gaussclumps  is better at handling blended sources , although its output clumps necessarily conform to a strict gaussian profile as opposed to the arbitrary shapes from clfind .",
    "the way each algorithm find clumps of emission is controlled by a number of tuning parameters .",
    "our overall aim in this paper is to compare the populations of clumps found _ independently _ by clfind  and gaussclumps .",
    "we therefore try to find the same objects with both algorithms , namely clumps larger than the beamsize with peaks greater than @xmath15 , but do not try to make the algorithms find exactly the same identifications clump - to - clump . in so doing",
    ", we follow the majority of previous studies and select parameters for each algorithm that are considered optimal for rejecting spurious detections . in an alternative approach , one could try to produce clump catalogues which were as similar as possible .",
    "however , the standard algorithm outputs we supply are quite different because of the very different way clumps are found with the two algorithms . given that we can never definitively know the true , underlying clump population , then selecting one algorithm population to make more similar to the other would be completely arbitrary _ a priori_. indeed , it is only through detailed analysis , such as the one presented in this paper , or monte - carlo simulations that such a decision regarding algorithm selection could be made .",
    "the most important parameters to tune clfind s output are the value of the lowest contour level ( @xmath16 ) and the contour level spacing ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "@xmath18 of 2@xmath19 is considered optimal for rejecting clumps otherwise fitted to noise spikes @xcite .",
    "@xmath20 essentially sets the clump peak threshold ( @xmath21 ) . after some experimentation we settled on the optimum parameters to find plausible clumps : @xmath18 and @xmath16 both @xmath22 , so clumps must have peaks @xmath23 .",
    "additionally , the clumps had to be larger than the beam size and contain at least 7 pixels .",
    "we find 85 clumps in this manner which are depicted across the four regions in fig .",
    "[ fig : clfind_clumps ] .",
    "the full catalogue of clfind  detections is listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : clfind_detections ] .                      for the gaussclumps  algorithm",
    "the most sensitive tuning parameter was the threshold , the minimum value at which the routine would attempt a model fit ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "as for clfind , clumps with widths smaller than the beam size ( 14arcsec ) were rejected . in total ,",
    "122 clumps were located in the four regions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gauss_clumps ] .",
    "tab.[tab : gclumps_detections ] provides the full the list of gaussclumps  identifications .",
    "although we identify clumps in the same data with the same algorithm , find fewer clumps ( the total number of clumps found in this work and is summarized in tab .",
    "[ table : numberclumps_allalgs ] ) . use the idl implementation of clfind  on the scuba maps with an unsharp mask applied to remove structure on spatial scales @xmath25arcmin .",
    "the most plausible explanation for this discrepancy is the different clump threshold , although there are other differences . in our catalogue",
    ", we include all clfind  detections found with @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "this ensures the detections all have peaks @xmath28 .",
    "however , only select their clfind  detections ( with @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) that have peaks @xmath31 . additionally , they select less bright sources , with peaks @xmath32 that also have an identification by eye in their original paper @xcite or are bolocam sources @xcite .",
