    "a possible relation between the central velocity dispersion of the spheroidal component ( @xmath1 ) and the galaxy circular velocity ( @xmath0 ) measured in the flat region of the rotation curve ( rc ) was suggested by whitmore et al .",
    "( 1979 ) . by measuring stellar velocity dispersions and h  i  line widths for a sample of 19 spiral galaxies they found a a significant decrease in @xmath0@xmath3@xmath1  with increasing bulge - to - disk ratio .",
    "since @xmath1  and @xmath0  probe the potential of the spheroid and dark matter ( dm ) halo , a mean value @xmath0@xmath3@xmath1",
    "@xmath4 implies these components are dynamically separate with the bulge substantially cooler than halo .",
    "gerhard et al .",
    "( 2001 ) derived the @xmath0@xmath2  relation for the sample of giant ellipticals studied by kronawitter et al .",
    "this was explained as an indication of near dynamical homology of these objects which were selected to be nearly round and almost non - rotating elliptical galaxies .",
    "these galaxies form a unique dynamical family which scales with luminosity and effective radius . as a consequence the maximum @xmath0  of the galaxy",
    "is correlated to its @xmath1 . whether the same is true for more flattened and fainter ellipticals is still to be investigated . on the contrary ,",
    "both shape and amplitude of the rc of a spiral galaxy depend on the galaxy luminosity and morphological type ( e.g. , burstein & rubin 1985 ) . as a consequence for spiral galaxies the @xmath0@xmath2relation",
    "is not expected a priori .",
    "nevertheless , ferrarese ( 2002 ) and baes ( 2003 ) found that elliptical and spiral galaxies define a common @xmath0@xmath2  relation .",
    "in particular , it results that for a given @xmath1  the value of @xmath0  is independent of the morphological type . but",
    "@xmath1  and @xmath0  are related to the mass of the supermassive black hole ( hereafter smbh , see ferrarese & ford 2005 for a review ) and dm halo ( e.g. , seljak 2002 ) , respectively . therefore ferrarese ( 2002 )",
    "argued that the @xmath0@xmath2relation is suggestive of a correlation between the mass of smbh and dm halo .",
    "previous works concentrated on high surface brightness ( hsb ) galaxies .",
    "it is interesting to investigate whether the @xmath0@xmath2relation holds also for less dense objects characterized by a less steep potential well .",
    "this is the case of low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies , which are disc galaxies with a central face - on surface brightness @xmath5 mag arcsec@xmath6 ( e.g. , impey et al . 1996 ) . in pizzella",
    "( 2005 ) we studied the behavior of lsb galaxies in the @xmath0@xmath2  relation . here",
    "we present our results .",
    "in the past years we started a scientific program aimed at deriving the detailed kinematics of ionized gas and stars in hsb and lsb galaxies in order to study their mass distribution and structural properties ( e.g. , pignatelli et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "we measured the velocity curves and velocity dispersion profiles along the major axis for both the ionized - gas and stellar components for a preliminary sample of @xmath7 hsb galaxies [ @xmath8 s0s0/a s in corsini et al .",

    "the hsb sample consists of disc galaxies with hubble type ranging from s0 to scd , an inclination @xmath13 and a distance @xmath14 mpc .",
    "the lsb sample consists of disc galaxies with hubble type ranging from sa to irr , an intermediate inclination ( @xmath15 ) , and a distance @xmath16 mpc . in order to complete our sample of disc galaxies we included the 38 sa - scd galaxies previously studied by ferrarese ( 2002 ) and the 12 sb - sc galaxies by baes et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "finally , we considered a sample of 24 elliptical galaxies with a flat rc and for which both @xmath0  and @xmath1  are available from the literature .",
    "they include 19 objects studied by kronawitter et al .",
    "( 2000 ) who derived @xmath0  by dynamical modeling and 5 objects studied by bertola et al .",
    "( 1993 ) for which @xmath0  is directly derived from the flat portion of their h  i  rcs .",
    "the addition of these galaxies will allow to test against model - dependent biases in the @xmath0@xmath2  relation .",
    "for all the disc galaxies we obtained the ionized - gas rc .",
    "we rejected galaxies with asymmetric rcs or rcs which were not characterized by an outer flat portion .",
    "the flatness of each rc has been checked by fitting it with a linear law @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "the radial range has been chosen in order to avoid the bulge - dominated region .",
    "the rcs with @xmath19 @xmath20 within 3@xmath21 have been considered not to be flat .",
    "we derived @xmath0  by averaging the outermost values of the flat portion of the rc .",
    "we derived @xmath1  from the stellar kinematics by extrapolating the velocity dispersion radial profile to the centre .",
    "this has been done by fitting the innermost data points with an empirical function ( either an exponential , or a gaussian or a constant ) .",
    "we did not apply any aperture correction to @xmath1  as discussed by pizzella et al .",
    "( 2004a ) .    for the elliptical galaxies we obtained @xmath0  either from the dynamical models by gerhard et al .",
    "( 2001 ) or from the flat portion of the h  irc .",
    "for these galaxies we relaxed the flatness criterion in favor of their large radial extension which is about 10 times larger than that of optical rcs .",
    "aperture measurements of the stellar velocity dispersion corrected to @xmath22 were adopted to estimate @xmath1 .",
    "in summary , we have @xmath23 disc galaxies [ @xmath24 from our preliminary sample , @xmath10 from ferrarese ( 2002 ) , and @xmath25 from baes et al . ( 2003 ) with flat rcs extending to @xmath26 and @xmath27 elliptical galaxies [ @xmath28 from kronawitter et al .",
    "( 2000 ) with flat rcs extending to about @xmath29 , @xmath30 from bertola et al .",

    "the data points corresponding to the 5 elliptical galaxies with @xmath0based on h  i  data follow the same relation as the remaining disc and elliptical galaxies .",
    "they are mostly located on the upper end of the @xmath0@xmath2  relation derived for disc galaxies , in agreement with the findings of bertola et al .",
    "they studied these elliptical galaxies and showed that their dm content and distribution are similar to those of spiral galaxies .    and @xmath1 .",
    "the data points corresponding to hsb galaxies ( _ filled circles _ ) , lsb galaxies ( _ squares _ ) , and elliptical galaxies with @xmath0  obtained from h  i  data ( _ diamonds _ ) or dynamical models ( _ crosses _ ) are shown .",

    "3 ) to lsb galaxies . for a comparison , the _ dashed line _ corresponds to the power - law fit to spiral galaxies with @xmath38 km s@xmath39 by baes et al .",
    "( 2003).,width=359 ]",
    "the lsb and hsb galaxies do not follow the same @xmath0@xmath2  relation .",
    "in fact , most of the lsb galaxies are characterized by a higher @xmath0  for a given @xmath1  ( or a lower @xmath1  for a given @xmath0 ) with respect to hsb galaxies . by applying to the lsb data",
    "points the same regression analysis which has been adopted for the hsb and elliptical galaxies of the final sample , we find @xmath40 with @xmath0  and @xmath1  expressed in @xmath33 .",
    "the straight line corresponding to this fit , which is different from the one obtained for hsb and elliptical galaxies and happens to be parallel to it , is plotted in fig .",
    "1 ( dotted line ) . to address the significance of this result , which is based only on 8 data points , we compared the distribution of the normalized scatter of the lsb galaxies to that of the hsb and elliptical galaxies .",
    "they are different at a high confidence level ( @xmath41 ) by a kolmogorov - smirnov test .",
    "the fact that these objects fall in a different region of the @xmath0@xmath2  plane confirms that lsb and hsb galaxies constitute two different classes of galaxies .",
    "both demographics of smbhs and study of dm distribution in galactic nuclei benefit from the @xmath0@xmath2  relation .",
    "the recent finding that the mass of smbhs correlates with different properties of the host spheroid supports the idea that formation and accretion of smbhs are closely linked to the formation and evolution of their host galaxy .",
    "a task to be pursued is to obtain a firm description of all these relationships spanning a wide range of smbh masses and address if they hold for all hubble types .",
    "in fact , the current demography of smbhs suffers of important biases , related to the limited sampling over the different basic properties of their host galaxies .",
    "the finding that the @xmath0@xmath2  relation holds for small values of @xmath1  points to the idea that smbhs with masses m@xmath42 m@xmath43 may also exist and follow the m@xmath44-@xmath21 relation .",
    "moreover , it has been suggested that the @xmath0@xmath2  relation is equivalent to one between the masses of smbh and dm halo ( ferrarese 2002 ; baes 2003 ) because @xmath1  and @xmath0  are related to the masses of the central smbh and dm halo , respectively . yet , this claim is to be considered with caution , as the demography of smbhs is still limited , in particular as far as spiral galaxies are concerned .",
    "furthermore , the calculation of the virial mass of the dm halo from the measured @xmath0  depends on the assumptions made for the dm density profile and the resulting rotation curve ( e.g. , see the prescriptions by seljack et al .",
    "2002 ) . a better estimate of the virial velocity of the dm halo @xmath45  can be obtained by constraining the baryonic - to - dark matter fraction with detailed dynamical modeling of the sample galaxies .",
    "the resulting @xmath45@xmath46@xmath1  relation is expected to have a smaller scatter than the @xmath0@xmath2  relation .",
    "if the m@xmath44-@xmath21 relation is to hold , the deviation of lsb galaxies _ with bulge _ from the @xmath0@xmath2  of hsb and elliptical galaxies suggests that for a given dm halo mass the lsb galaxies would host a smbh with a smaller mass compared to hsb galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "if the fundamental correlation of smbh mass is with the halo @xmath0 , then lsbs should have larger black - hole masses for given bulge @xmath1 .",
    "this should be accounted for in the theoretical and numerical investigations of the processes leading to the formation of lsb galaxies .",
    "the collapse of baryonic matter can induce a further concentration in the dm distribution , and a deepening of the overall gravitational well in the central regions . if this is the case , the finding that at a given dm mass ( as traced by @xmath0 ) the central @xmath1  of lsb galaxies is smaller than in their hsb counterparts , would argue against the relevance of baryon collapse in the radial density profile of dm in lsb galaxies ."
