    "in massive nss with enhanced cooling , strong proton superfluidity may spread out the opening of the direct urca process over some density range . as a result , the enhanced cooling sets in gradually with the growth of ns mass ( not as sharp at @xmath30 , as in fig .",

    "this allows one to interpret the colder sources as massive nss of different masses .",
    "strong proton superfluidity , with @xmath31k , appears in hot nss with large neutrino luminosity , so that the neutrino emission due to cooper pairing of protons is unimportant ( yakovlev et al .",

    "this property holds as long as proton pairing is strong in the entire ns core .",

    "the effect of neutron superfluidity is opposite . in these stars",
    "the mild pairing appears earlier , at @xmath43 yr , when neutrino emission due to the direct urca process is much stronger than the cooper pairing neutrino emission ( which is , therefore , insignificant ) .",
    "on the other hand , additional suppression of the direct urca process by neutron superfluidity makes the most massive nss a bit hotter in the advanced stage of neutrino cooling era . as for transiently accreting nss in sxts ,",
    "their thermal states become independent of the ns heat capacity as soon as they reach the steady - state regime ( yakovlev et al .  2003 ; 2004b ) .",

    "the same effect in lightest among the massive sxts hampers the explanation of ks 1721260 .",

    "however , mild pairing might occur in the inner core which is present only in massive nss .",
    "let us explore this case .    from fig .",
    "[ fig:1p1nt ] we see that neutrino emission due to cooper pairing of neutrons may initiate a very fast cooling and , thus , may serve as a fast cooling agent ( at least , for inss ) .    in inss ,",
    "such a possibility was studied by @xcite and @xcite . in particular , the latter authors consider nucleon ns models based on the eos of @xcite which prohibits the direct urca process .",
    "their cooling scenario is based on strong proton pairing in the outer ns core and mild neutron pairing in the inner core ( phenomenological models `` p1 '' and `` nt1 '' , respectively ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : sf ] ) .",
    "the model `` nt1 '' has a specific dependence @xmath29 which keeps neutron pairing weak in the outer core .",
    "let us remind that weak superfluidity , with @xmath45k , does not appear in low - mass nss in the neutrino cooling era : these nss are too hot .",
    "accordingly , in this era neutron pairing `` nt1 '' affects only massive nss .",
    "@xcite compared such cooling scenario ( called by dany page a  minimal cooling model \" , for its simplicity , and the minimal number of its ingredients ) with observations of inss , and found it marginally consistent with them .",
    "the scenario can explain those inss whose thermal emission is detected with confidence , as illustrated in the left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : min ] .",
    "however , these authors noted that the model will fail if the two sources , rx j0205 + 64 and cta@xmath46 ( expected to be thermally emitting inss ) , turn out to be much colder than their presently established upper limits , or if very cold inss are detected in future .    since nss in sxts",
    "are expected to be rather massive , owing to accretion of matter from their companions , it is worth to test the  minimal cooling scenario \" against the data on sxts . that is done in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : min ] .",
    "one can see that the model successfully reproduces hotter sxts , including the frequently bursting sources aql@xmath47x-1 , rx 17092639 and 4u 160852 .",
    "however , the upper limits for at least two sources , 1h 1905 + 000 and sax 1808.43658 , definitely fall far below the predictions of the model .    the transient source 1h@xmath471905 + 000 was recently observed with chandra @xcite ; the upper limit for its quiescent thermal luminosity seems to be firm . on the contrary , the value of @xmath14 for this object is quite uncertain ; some physical arguments allow one to believe it to be higher than @xmath48 .",
    "for the frequently bursting transient sax 1808.43658 the mass accretion rate is known more accurately , while the upper limit of its quiescent thermal luminosity is less certain .",
    "it varies from @xmath49 erg@xmath50s@xmath51 in @xcite to @xmath52 erg@xmath50s@xmath51 in estimations of p.  shtykovski ( private communication ; see details in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , both these upper limits are clearly much below the predictions of the minimal cooling model . in present paper",
    "we have adopted the same upper limit on bolometric luminosity of sax 1808.43658 as in @xcite .",
    "thus , despite many theoretical and observational uncertainties , it seems that the  minimal cooling model \" is ruled out by the data on sxts .",
    "therefore , the mechanism of the enhanced ns cooling should be more powerful than the process of cooper pairing of neutrons .    nevertheless , mild neutron superfluidity localized in the inner ns core is not prohibited .",
    "if it is available , together with proton superfluidity , the enhanced cooling should be of the direct urca type .",
    "if , however , proton pairing does not extend to the inner core , neutron superfluidity remains the only regulator of cooling of massive nss .",
    "this case was studied by @xcite in ns models with open direct urca process .",
    "because of the lack of space , we do not illustrate this case .",
    "we just note that this model easily fits hot and cold sources but scarcely explains quite a large span of intermediate sources , for example , vela and cen  x-4 .",
    "as mild neutron superfluidity might exist in the inner ns core , let us outline its effect on thermal evolution of sxts .",
    "in contrast to inss , thermal states of nss in sxts depend not only on ns properties but also on the accretion rate .    as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : min ] ( right ) , heating curves for medium - mass sxts drop abruptly when the mass accretion rate becomes lower than some threshold value specific for an ns of a given mass .",
    "as we already know , this drop ( the vertical segment of a curve ) signals the onset of neutron superfluidity in the ns core when the deep crustal heating becomes insufficient to keep the core temperature above the maximal critical temperature of neutrons .",
    "let us remind that nss are thermally inertial objects .",
    "a thermal state of the star as a whole may change noticeably on time scales of @xmath53 yr @xcite .",
    "we also recall that heating curves refer to steady - states which nss reach in a few millions years after the onset of the accretion stage in sxts .",
    "the abrupt drops of heating curves indicate that thermal evolution of sxts exhibits _ dichotomy_.",
    "this means that two nss with the same mass may evolve to very different steady states if their mass accretion rates are slightly different .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : split ] illustrates how a change of @xmath14 by one percent from some  threshold \" value entails a change of the steady state thermal luminosity by a factor of @xmath54 .",
    "moreover , a tiny mismatch of masses of two nss , or a small difference of their inner temperatures before the onset of the accretion stage , may also induce similar dichotomy .",
    "the latter effect is illustrated in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : split ] .",
    "the former one can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : min ] ( and fig .  [ fig:1p1nt ] ) : at some `` threshold '' @xmath14 , nss with masses different by one percent ( @xmath55 ) may show thermal luminosities which differ by factor of @xmath56 .",
    "one can also speculate that the dichotomy can be caused by a variable crust composition , which can change the efficiency of deep crustal heating at a given @xmath14 ( see haensel & zdunik , 1990 ; 2003 ) .",
    "concluding , whatever causes the dichotomy , the presence of mild neutron superfluidity in the ns core may considerably complicate an interpretation of thermal emission from sxts .",
    "we have shown that the data on quiescent thermal emission from sxts require the presence of strong proton superfluidity and the absence of mild neutron superfluidity in the outer ns core ( i.e. , in low - mass nss ) .",
    "the mechanism which controls fast neutrino cooling of massive nss should be more powerful than that due to cooper pairing of neutrons and , probably , than the direct - urca - type processes with kaons and pions .",

    "further studies are required to confirm or reject our inferences .",
