    "note , that the coefficients in ( 2 ) are random .",
    "let us call ( 2 ) a  semi - discrete  numerical scheme because , in general , we discretize only a part of our original sde . in practice",
    "we will choose @xmath23 such that this numerical scheme will have a known explicit solution , for example , the  semi - discrete  sde ( 2 ) may be linear .",

    "the sde ( 3 ) , i.e. the  semi - discrete  sde , is not an implicit numerical scheme , because in order to solve for @xmath21 we have to solve a stochastic differential equation and not an algebraic equation . in our setting",
    ", we can not reproduce the known implicit numerical schemes but we can reproduce for example the euler scheme .",
    "so the usual euler scheme belongs to our setting choosing @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "another interesting way to choose @xmath23 is @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this comes from the fact that the following sde , @xmath32 has a known explicit solution ( see @xcite , p. 117 ) .",
    "we can use also other , more sophisticated , sdes with known explicit solutions as these described in @xcite .",
    "thus , our method here is more general than @xcite because we can arrive to other sdes , like linear sdes , choosing suitable @xmath23 .",
    "the main advantage of our method is that we produce always explicit numerical schemes in contrast to other interesting but implicit methods ( see for example @xcite , @xcite ) .    another suitable choice , that we are going to use in our example in this paper , is @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "then the resulting  semi - discrete  sde will be a linear stochastic differential equation with known explicit solution .",
    "let us point out that our main result and setting remains true for the multidimensional case but in order to present our method as simply as possible we will remain in the one dimensional case .    in the second section we will state and prove a convergence result and next we will give an application . for a general study of the numerical analysis of stochastic differential equations one can see @xcite .",
    "in this section we shall prove that our numerical scheme converges to the true solution .",

    "we can write now , @xmath49 taking expectations on both sides , using doob s martingale inequality for the second term at the right hand side and assumption a for @xmath50 we arrive at , @xmath51 .",
    "we begin with , @xmath52 taking expectations , using ito s isometry and the fact that @xmath53 we have that , @xmath54    collecting all together and using the gronwall inequality we arrive at , @xmath55    now , given @xmath56 choose @xmath44 such that @xmath57 and then choose @xmath15 such that @xmath58 . finally , choose @xmath26 small enough to get the desired result .",
    "below we will propose an explicit numerical scheme for a super linear sde as an application of theorem 1 . consider the following sde , @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "this sde has a unique strong solution and we know that the usual euler scheme diverges ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we propose the following  semi - discrete  numerical scheme which is explicit , @xmath63 this semi discrete scheme is a linear sde with unique strong solution , @xmath64    we need the moment bounds which we will prove in the next lemma .",

    "but @xmath78 .",
    "that means that @xmath79 as @xmath80 so @xmath81 in probability and noting that @xmath82 increases as @xmath15 increases we have that @xmath81 almost surely too , as @xmath80 .",
    "going back to ( 4 ) and using fatou s lemma we obtain , @xmath83 for any @xmath69 and this is crucial to ensure that @xmath84 in the next step . using ito s formula again on @xmath85 , taking supremum and",
    "then expectations and finally doob s martingale inequality we arrive at , @xmath86 for some @xmath87 .",
    "to prove now that @xmath88 we use theorem 2.4.1 of @xcite and obtain first the bound , @xmath89 for any @xmath69 and then using ito s formula on @xmath90 taking supremum and then expectations and finally doob s martingale inequality we obtain the desired bound .    finally , we shall prove that @xmath91 set @xmath92 . using ito s formula on @xmath93 we have , @xmath94 using gronwall s inequality",

    "as before we deduce that @xmath98 and then that @xmath99     @xmath59    now we can apply theorem 1 to prove that our explicit numerical scheme converges in the mean square sense . let us note that from the above moment bounds for the true solution we deduce that @xmath100 a.s .",
    "indeed , we have proved that @xmath101 therefore , letting @xmath102 we obtain that @xmath103 , noting that @xmath104 thus , we need our numerical scheme to be positivity preserving . as we can see",

    "however , the tamed euler scheme does not seem to preserve positivity , at least , for any @xmath105 .",
    "we shall give a simulation to show that the two numerical schemes are close .",
    "so , let the following sde , @xmath106.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we apply the tamed euler scheme and the semi discrete scheme to this problem for @xmath107 and we plot the difference between these methods , i.e. if @xmath108 we plot @xmath109 on @xmath110 $ ] .",
