    "a common belief in x - ray astronomy is that the spacecraft wobble precludes the possibility of obtaining correct information about the variability of observed sources .",
    "the spacecraft wobble was introduced in order to prevent a given source from always being detected by the same pixel / pixels of the sensor .",
    "the linear wobble in rosat has been replaced by 2-dimensional `` dithering '' in the recent chandra satellite , but the purpose of the technique remains unchanged . in rosat",
    "a consequence of the wobble is that the mesh wires in the entrance window of the instrument occult the observed source , thus introducing an instrumental variability .",
    "such instrumental variability complicates observations , but it is far from destroying the information about the real variability of the source . on the contrary , in different physical measurements",
    "the emission from the source is chopped in order to increase the possibility of detection . in nature , certain species , like jumping spiders ( _ salticidae _ ) acquire visual data by sweeping an essentially linear retina back and forth perpendicularly to its larger dimension @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the oscillating retina not only increases the resolution of the image , but also improves the over - all performance of vision , including its temporal resolution .",
    "this vision - enhancing principle is planned for use in the next generation of mars rovers ( new scientist , 2001 ) .",
    "modern signal processing techniques offer a wide range of possibilities for separating different components in the signal . in the case of x - ray observations",
    "the recorded signal is , as a rule , polluted by poisson statistics , due to small numbers of recorded photons .",
    "however , during recent years a wavelet technique has been developed @xcite which removes much of the poisson statistics from the data . in the present work",
    "the question whether the spacecraft wobble obscures the intrinsic variability of the source will be addressed using recent information processing techniques .",
    "data from two intense x - ray sources : crab and ngc 5548 were used in the present study .",
    "variability is an important characteristic of many astronomical systems , and rapid , apparently random variability is distinctive of many galactic and extra - galactic objects which are thought to harbor black holes , or other types of compact objects  -- x - ray binaries , qso s , agn and sources of gamma - ray bursts.it has proved very difficult to analyze in any reliable way the various components of the variability data from these objects in order to learn more about their underlying causes within the sources themselves .",
    "here we review and extend the application we have made elsewhere @xcite of wavelet transform along with non - linear filtering techniques to the rapid x - ray variability of seyfert 1 ( s1 ) galaxies and qso s . in particular , we show how we have employed these methods  to remove the poisson - statistical and wobble - related variability from the rosat data for the s1 ngc 5548 and for the qso 3c273 . in doing so have confirmed the presence of intrinsic transient low - level deterministic and even quasi - periodic structures in data , which strongly indicate the occurrence of quasi - regular elementary events in the sources themselves .",
    "these results were first reported in @xcite .",
    "this paper presents a more detailed , careful and improved treatment of the methods used and the results obtained , particularly of the wobble - related and poisson - statistical influences which must be removed to facilitate the determination of the properties of these sources .",
    "our work confirms and strengthens observationally based support for the intrinsic character of the quasi - periodic and deterministic events we first reported in @xcite , and significantly extends it to determination of the persistence of such events , their time - scales , and amplitudes .",
    "the methods we describe and apply here can obviously be applied to a wide - range of variable astronomical phenomena .",
    "further confirmation of these results , of course , is crucial -- particularly by using data from more recent x - ray satellites , such as chandra .",
    "the variability spectrum of an x - ray source may be a combination of deterministic and stochastic components ( see the upper part of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the combined photon flux is increasingly affected by the poisson statistics with the increased distance from the source .",
    "finally , the photon train , measured at the spacecraft , is modulated by the wobble in a way which depends both on the apparent luminosity and on the spatial properties of the source .",
    "efficient deconvolution of the poisson statistics from the time - scale spectra ( frequency domain ) became possible after of the introduction the wavelet transform into studies of photon trains @xcite . using the wavelet",
    "transform as a pre - processing tool , non - linear modelling of the photon train  variability may be performed using a neural network technique @xcite .",
    "the problem of deconvolution of the spacecraft wobble may also be properly addressed using this technique .",
    "an advantage of the wobble is that it is known with a high degree of accuracy .",
    "that information may , for each observation period , be obtained from rosat archives .",
    "it may also be retrieved from photon history files , comparing photon sky coordinates and photon detector coordinates . as an example , both the x- ( r.a . ) and y - components ( declination ) of the wobble for ror 701246 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] as a function of time .",
    "the wobble is given in units of detector pixels .",
    "since the wobble has a form of a symmetrical sawtooth signal , there will be a number of harmonics ( see table  [ table1 ] . )",
    "observed in the spectrum .",
    "lc fundamental & 400.0 + 2:harmonics & 200.0 + 3:harmonics & 133.3 + 4:harmonics & 100.0 + 5:harmonics & 80.0 + 6:harmonics & 57.1 +    a detailed description of the instrument may be found in the rosat users handbook .",
    "there are some other construction details that may generate some additional variability components . in the pspc instrument ,",
    "the window is supported by a system of two wire meshes : one coarse and one fine .",
    "it may be expected that both meshes will , during the wobble , generate a so - called moir - pattern which enhances the 5:th harmonics of the wobble ( 80 sec ) .  however , considering the diameters of the mesh wires , the obscuring scale size will be of the order of 10 .",
    "an obstacle of that size will not be very efficient in obscuring x - ray sources considering the limited resolving power of the pspc instrument .",
    "all harmonics , except for components caused by reflections in the instrument , must be phase - locked to the wobble .",
    "this property is important when it is necessary to remove the wobble - related components from the variability components intrinsic to the source .  in the present work both",
    "the bulk of the poisson component and the wobble - generated components are for the most part removed using a neural network model of spectral density in the time - scale  -  wavelet coefficient magnitude domain .",
    "in previous work @xcite a frequency component with a period of about 80 sec was shown as an example of the deterministic components in the variability of ngc 5548 during ror 701246 .",
    "the indicated period is close to one of the wobble - generated frequency components .",
    "since the period was determined using the `` short time '' fft ( sfft ) , it must be remembered the sfft is not suitable for frequency analysis of the highly non - stationary photon counting rate .",
    "the fft frequency spectrum is made using a constant width frequency interval . when plotted as a function of period ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) the poor resolution in the low frequency part of the spectrum is obvious .    the wavelet spectrum ( scalogram ) , shown in the right graph of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , uses a variable ( frequency dependent ) mother wavelet of morlet type .",
    "it is also apparent that the resolution in the low frequency range of the spectrum is much better than in the fft spectrum .",
    "it may be seen that the raw spectrum of photon counts seems to be dominated by the wobble frequency ( 400 sec period ) and its harmonics .",
    "in addition to more uniform frequency resolution there is an important advantage in using the wavelet spectrum .",
    "the scalogram may be converted into an ampligram @xcite which is a set of inverse transforms of the results of non - linear filtering in the domain of wavelet coefficient magnitudes . for each band -",
    "pass of the wavelet coefficient magnitude the inverse transform will result in a time series corresponding to the signal within that magnitude interval . in the present study",
    "the wavelet coefficient magnitude ( wcm ) up to 40% of its maximum value is analysed .",
    "a 4% band - pass is shifted in 4% steps obtaining 10 levels of the wavelet coefficient magnitude .",
    "the present technique gives the possibility of decomposing a signal consisting of components of different magnitudes .",
    "the method was developed to separate the poisson variability from intrinsic variations in counting rate .  in the same way",
    ", it will be shown that the combined effect of the poisson distribution and of the spacecraft wobble may be removed from the observed counting rate .",
    "another forward wavelet transform applied to the ampligram converts it into the time scale spectrum @xcite , showing the wavelet coefficient magnitude for each ampligram level ( wcma ) as a function of time scale . the time scale spectrum ( tss )",
    "is thus the spectrum of time scale at different levels of the wavelet coefficient magnitude of the original time series , averaged over the entire observation period .",
    "the wcma is proportional to the persistence ( cf .",
    "section 6 ) of a component with a given magnitude and is represented by the darkness of the gray scale in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] , [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] . the time scale spectrum for the entire observation interval of ror 701246 is shown in fig .",

    "positions of the wobble and its harmonics are indicated by vertical lines .    ]",
    "the time scale spectrum of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] may be displayed in the form of 10  2-d graphs .",
    "position of the wobble and its harmonics is indicated by double vertical bars on each sub - diagram .",
    "it may be seen that the strongest coincidence between the wobble and its second harmonics ( 200 sec ) is in the 8% band ( fig  [ fig5]b ) .",
    "the 80 sec peak , expected in the wobble - related variability , coincides with an observed peak only in the 12% and 16% , 4%-pass - bands ( figs  [ fig5]c , d ) .  at all higher levels of the wavelet coefficient magnitude peaks occurring in the spectrum can not be correlated with either the wobble , or with its harmonics .",
    "the fact that a spectral peak coincides with a given wobble - related frequency can not be considered as a proof of its origin .",
    "if a signal component and the corresponding spectral peak is really wobble - related , there must be a well - defined phase relation between the wobble and the signal",
    ". however , this will not be the case for components generated by reflections in the instrument .",
    "a simple method to test the phase relation is to calculate the cross - correlation function between the wobble and all 10 levels of the counting rate ampligram .",
    "the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) was calculated using the commercial software package spss .",
    "results of calculations are shown in table  [ table2 ] where the peak cross - correlation is listed together with the corresponding phase difference ( lag time ) and confidence limits .",

    "[ fig5]b ) .",
    "however , the observed average phase difference ( 32 degrees ) can not be explained by assuming that both dominating components are wobble - related .",
    "all calculated peak values of ccf are outside the confidence limits .",
    "now we will analyse the effect of wobble and stochastic poisson statistics on the resulting overall x - ray variability of the observed sources .",
    "since the analyzed counting rates are small and have an extremely skew distribution with respect to apparent luminosity ( dominance of low average photon counting rates ) , a conventional averaging process would give very little information .",
    "photon history files for ngc 5548 were converted into a photon counting rate using 1-sec sampling bins .",
    "photon counting rate files were converted into ampligrams @xcite , and subsequently into time scale spectra .",
    "the time scale spectra covered the interval of wavelet coefficient magnitudes up to 40% of the maximum magnitude and the time scales between 5 and 256 seconds .",
    "the upper time scale limit was now shorter than in the case of ror 701246 displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] , since the model ( described below ) was based on all observation periods of ngc 5548 , some of them with only 1000 sec duration .",
    "each time scale spectrum was a 10 x 128 matrix ( number of levels in the ampligram x number of dilations in the wavelet transform ) .",
    "since the amount of data was not large enough to properly remove the dependence on apparent luminosity using conventional statistical methods , an alternative method has been used .",
    "a back - propagation ( bp ) neural network was used for modelling the available data .",
    "training was performed using 85% of the entire data while the remaining 15% was used to test the model .",
    "the training data was randomly selected .  the model consisted of the following variables :    [ [ input ] ] input + + + + +    * average counts ( apparent luminosity ) , which were determined for each observation period . * photon energy index indicating the energy interval * m  wavelet coefficient magnitude in % of its maximum value .",

    "a recall of the trained network using the test data ( not used for training ) gives one value of the correlation coefficient between the pair of spectral vectors : that retrieved from the model and the measured one .",
    "one value of the correlation coefficient is obtained for each component of the spectral vector .",
    "that set of correlation coefficients is a measure of both the predictive ability of the model and also its generalizing ability ( response to previously unseen data ) .",
    "values of correlation coefficients for the present network lie between 0.8 and 0.95 in the entire range of time scales .",
    "these very high correlation coefficients indicate the very high quality of the present model and most likely the high consistency of the data used to generate the model .",
    "results using the ngc 5548 model for the data of ror 701246 for the photon energies e<0.5 kev are presented below .",
    "the top diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows : the observed time scale spectrum for the data of ror 701246 .",
    "the middle diagram shows the time scale spectrum retrieved from the model . that spectrum contains apparent luminosity dependent components present in all ngc5548 data , i.  e , the wobble - related and poisson - related components .",
    "the difference between the above spectra may be attributed to intrinsic variations involving `` elementary events '' in the source during that particular period of time .",
    "the difference spectrum , exceeding error intervals , is shown in the bottom graph of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .",
    "of course , this method will only pick out transient deterministic structures  any structure , such as a periodicity , which is common to all observation periods",
    "will also be eliminated by this analysis .",
    "at the same time , one may speculate that perhaps certain wobble - related harmonic features do not show up in all observation periods , and thus are not excluded by this averaged subtraction process .",
    "they may only appear when the source is nearly on - axis , for instance .",
    "this is indeed possible ",
    "it is also clear , for instance , that the ~80 s harmonics of the wobble are only apparent in three of the pass - bands of fig .",
    "[ fig5]a , b and h. however , the fact the detected structures are not exactly at the harmonic frequency and are not phase - locked to the wobble indicates that its origin is elsewhere .",
    "furthermore , the presence of persistent quasi - periodicities at frequencies different from those of the wobble harmonics is evidence that a process intrinsic to the source is at work .",
    "if the quasi - periodic structures were only at or near harmonic frequencies , that would be suspicious .    in ngc 5548",
    "the spectrum retrieved from the model for the actual counting rate is significantly different from the observed spectrum .",
    "as it was mentioned at the beginning of this section , the model extracts from the observed data common features present in the data .",
    "the obvious common features are the poisson statistics , the apparent luminosity dependence and wobble harmonics .",
    "the residuals after subtraction of the model from the observed ngc5548 spectra seem to consist of a number of deterministic events , limited in time scale ( frequency ) and magnitude .",
    "as we have pointed out in earlier papers , deterministic components of the variability appear as vertical or circular features in these time scale spectra , whereas stochastic components appear as prominent horizontal features .",
    "as we see , the components resulting from this subtraction do have circular shape , or vertical extent .    these structures , or elementary events",
    "are mainly limited to a single interval of wavelet coefficient magnitude ( 4% bandwidth ) and to a narrow band of time scale indicating a stable , nearly monochromatic signal with a duration ( persistence ) proportional to its intensity .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] shows a sample of difference spectra from different observation periods of ngc 5548 .",
    "the difference spectra were calculated for 30 observation periods of ngc 5548 .",
    "all those periods were longer than 1024 seconds .",
    "all events were identified automatically and their positions in the spectrum were read out .",
    "the entire time scale spectrum ( wavelet coefficient magnitudes 0  40% , time scales 5  256 seconds ) was divided into 10 x 16 equal bins and all events were sorted into corresponding bins .",
    "the result of event sorting is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8:a ] ( average intensity ) and   ( number of events within a bin ) .",
    "the result of the statistics shows that the events may occur anywhere within the investigated range of time scale spectrum .",
    "there is a slight increase in intensity towards small wavelet coefficient magnitudes , which could indicate that weak events are more persistent .",
    "a single event may be considered as a semi - periodic series of pulses .",
    "the persistence of a single event is related to its intensity on the time scale spectrum , but may also be studied in a different way . if the series of events is persistent enough it will not only produce a peak at its average time scale , but also at the multiples of the average time scale ( sub - harmonics ) .",
    "this may be seen in the example of ror 701246 shown in the left bottom graph of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , where some peaks look , at a first glance , to be the multiples of others .",
    "the order of multiples is limited , in addition to the nature of the phenomenon , by the duration of the observation period and subsequently by the largest measurable time scale .",
    "the problem may be addressed by a systematic search for multiples ( 2 and 3 times the basic time scale ) when varying the acceptance limit . for a given basic peak at a time scale , t",
    ", there is a peak at the multiple time scale , t@xmath20 , if @xmath21t@xmath22 - nt)/nt@xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the acceptance limit in percent , a variable in the present analysis , and n = 2 , 3 is the number of multiples .    the search for multiples",
    "is done for each observation period separately and results are compiled together for all analysed observation periods of ngc 5548 .",
    "the acceptance limit @xmath24 was varied from 1 to 20% , which means that the entire acceptance interval was varied from 2 to 40% .",
    "the result of analysis is given in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , showing number of identified multiples ( for both n=2 and n=3 ) when the value of acceptance limit @xmath24 increases .    ]",
    "the result of search indicates that , on average , the number of 2 t and 3 t multiples is nearly the same and that it increases linearly with increasing acceptance interval .",
    "horizontal sections of both curves correspond to empty spaces in the time scale distribution of peaks , where the peaks are obscured by the wobble harmonics .",
    "it may be shown by simulation that if both 2 t and 3 t multiples would be equally probable , the 3 t curve would be shifted down .",
    "the 3 t multiples must be more than twice as probable as 2 t in order to simulate the result of fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] .",
    "another result of simulation is that the wobble harmonics obscure efficiently other spectral peaks deviating less than 4% of its time scale .",
    "more information about properties of elementary events may be obtained studying average time scales of peaks and their multiples when the acceptance interval increases .",
    "the result of averaging is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "t@xmath25is the average time scale of basic peaks , which have been found to correspond to peaks with the double time scale , t@xmath26 .",
    "t@xmath27 is the average time scale of basic peaks , which have been found to correspond to peaks with the triple time scale , t@xmath28 . if the same peaks correspond to both double and triple peaks , t@xmath29= t@xmath27 . if the identification of double peaks is correct , and not a result of too large an acceptance interval , then : t@xmath26 = 2t@xmath29 . similarly : t@xmath28 = 3t@xmath27",
    "it may be seen that all above conditions are fulfilled only up to the acceptance interval of 6% ( acceptance limit of + /-3% ) .",
    "the conclusion must be that the process responsible for generation of elementary events has an internal bandwidth of 6% ( allowed deviations of the time scale ) .",
    "the length of observation intervals is too short for studying higher order multiples in the spectrum    ]",
    "it is helpful to compare the occurrence of elementary events in different source types . in order to assure that the observed features are real and not an artefact of the analytical technique",
    ", it must be established that the features occur throughout the entire energy range of the pspc instrument .  for this purpose ,",
    "the entire energy range of the pspc instrument was divided into 2 energy ranges ; < 0.5 kev and > 0.5 kev .",
    "only events occurring simultaneously at both energy intervals were taken into consideration .",
    "since there is a substantial difference in the red shift , z , between these two sources , both the time scales and the wavelet coefficient magnitudes must be corrected for the red shift so that the variability spectrum in the source s reference frame will be obtained .",
    "both sources are z - corrected : the time scale by dividing it with 1+z and the wavelet coefficient magnitudes by multiplying it with ( 1+z ) , since the photons are observed within a limited energy interval .",

    "this means that elementary events in 3c273 are responsible for not much more than 10% of its variability .",
    "this means that there is more intrinsic poisson - distributed variability of the photon train from that source than from the seyfert 1 ( s1 ) type source ( ngc 5548 ) .",
    "as shown earlier , the elementary events are visualized by subtracting the modelled variability from the actual , observed one .",
    "as it was shown earlier , the neural network model comprises types of variability common to all data used to construct the model .",

    "we have reviewed and discussed some of the principal obstacles to reducing variability data from astronomical sources -- including poisson statistics and instrumental motion , for example satellite wobble -- and the powerful methods of wavelet transform spectral analysis and non - linear filtering for overcoming these .",
    "we illustrated their application in a detailed way by applying these techniques to the rapidly variable x - ray emission from the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548 and to the qso 3c273 , confirming the presence and specifying some of the transient quasi - periodic and deterministic intrinsic events occurring in these sources .",
    "in particular , after removing the modelled poisson statistical and wobble - related variability components from the rosat time - scale spectra of 30 observation periods of ngc 5548 x - ray data , we found that there is significant residual variability . that is formed by a number of elementary events with a well defined time scale and magnitude .",
    "the elementary events seem to be distributed over the entire analyzed range of the time scale spectrum , both in time scale and magnitude domains . there is an indication of increasing intensity towards small magnitudes .",
    "low wobble harmonics suppress , rather than enhance , the observed elementary events .",
    "it has been found by simulation that a wobble harmonic efficiently obscure other spectral peaks deviating less than 4% of its time scale .",
    "typical elementary events last at least 3 basic time scales .",
    "the process responsible for the generation of elementary events has an internal bandwidth of 6% ( allowed deviations of the time scale ) .    for a qso type source ( 3c273 ) the elementary events",
    "are confined within a narrow range of normalized wavelet coefficient magnitudes around 10% .",
    "the elementary events in 3c273 are more intense , which may indicate that they are more persistent than the events observed in ngc 5548 .",
    "the apparent compression of the events around 10% of the normalized wavelet coefficient magnitude could indicate the existence of a stronger , intrinsic stochastic component in the qso type of source .",
    "however , a study of modelled variability spectra for a larger number of sources indicates that if there is an excess of an intrinsic stochastic component in the qso sources , it must be less than a factor of 2 ( see fig .  [ fig14 ] ) .",
    "these methods are widely applicable to all sorts of variable data , most notably to astronomical source variability in other spectral ranges . certainly , the results presented here need to be further confirmed by applying this analysis to data from more recent x - ray satellites , most notably chandra , and to a larger number of other extragalactic sources .",
