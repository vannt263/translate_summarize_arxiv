    "the analysis of fluid flow and heat transfer across a thin liquid film has attracted the attention of a number of researchers because of its possible practical applications in many branches of science and technology .",
    "the knowledge of flow and heat transfer within a thin liquid film is crucial in understanding the coating process and design of various heat exchangers and chemical processing equipment .",
    "other applications include wire and fiber coating , food stuff processing reactor fluidization , transpiration cooling and so on .",
    "the prime aim in almost every extrusion application is to maintain the surface quality of the extrudate .",
    "all coating processes demand a smooth glossy surface to meet the requirements for best appearance and optimum service properties such as low friction , transparency and strength.the problem of extrusion of thin surface layers needs special attention to gain some knowledge for controlling the coating product efficiently .",
    "+ heat transfer analysis due to a continuously moving stretching surface through an ambient fluid is one of the thrust areas of current research .",
    "this finds its application over a broad spectrum of science and engineering disciplines , especially in the field of chemical engineering .",
    "many chemical engineering processes like metallurgical process , polymer extrusion process involves cooling of a molten liquid being stretched into a cooling system . in such processes the fluid mechanical properties of the penultimate product would mainly depend on two things , one is the cooling liquid used and other is the rate of stretching .",
    "for example , in a melt spinning process , the extrudate from the die is generally drawn and simultaneously stretched into a filament or sheet , which is thereafter solidified through rapid quenching or gradual cooling by direct contact with water or the coolant liquid .",
    "the stretching provides a unidirectional orientation to the extrudate , thereby improving the fluid mechanical properties .",
    "the quality of the final product greatly depends on the rate of cooling and the stretching rate .",
    "the choice of an appropriate cooling liquid is crucial as it has a direct impact on rate of cooling and care must be taken to exercise optimum stretching rate otherwise sudden stretching may spoil the properties desired for the final outcome .",
    "some industrially important liquids like synthetic oils , dilute polymeric solutions such as 5.4% of polyisobutylene in cetane can be used as effective coolant liquids ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "since the quality of the final product in such extrusion processes depend considerably on the flow and heat transfer characteristics within a thin liquid film over a stretching sheet , the analysis and fundamental understanding of the momentum and thermal transports for such processes are very important . + in 1961 ,",

    "the applied transverse magnetic field is assumed to be of variable kind and is chosen in its special form as @xmath56    the particular form of the expressions for @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are chosen so as to facilitate the construction of a new similarity transformation which enables in transforming the governing partial differential equations of momentum and heat transport into a set of non - linear ordinary differential equations .",
