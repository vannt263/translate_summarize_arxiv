    "warm dense matter ( wdm ) @xcite , with density @xmath0 to @xmath1 times that of solid and temperature @xmath2 to @xmath3 , is commonly found in astrophysics as well as in high - energy density physics experiments @xcite . until the present , however , the properties of wdm are not well understood and are difficult to predict theoretically .",
    "this is because neither the models of condensed - matter nor from high - temperature plasmas are well suited for describing the intermediate regime of wdm .",
    "detailed information about the thermodynamic states , such as ionization distributions , is of importance in uncovering the involved physical mechanisms .",
    "the widely used models predicting an average ionization degree of atoms are thomas - fermi model @xcite and saha @xcite ionization model , however both of the models assume that plasma conditions are near thermal equilibrium . for laser",

    "an impact model based on electron - ion collisional cross sections has been explored @xcite , which allows to calculate ionization values in much more natural manner .",
    "this model directly describes the inter - particle interactions in the plasmas and thus , accounts for the multi - particle nature of real plasmas .",
    "although this impact ionization model allows improvements in dealing with non - equilibrium plasmas , it is still not complete since it does not account for the inverse process , such as electron - ion recombination @xcite .",
    "besides , the ionization potential depression ( ipd ) should be taken into account when dealing with high density plasmas @xcite , however it is also ignored in the considered model @xcite .",
    "the main challenge to understanding the ionization of wmd is to incorporate self - consistently the non - linear behaviour in such strongly coupled dynamical systems , i.e. , the matter s response to the surrounding plasmas through impact ionization , recombination and ipd , and plasma s response to the material through the dependence of plasma s temperature and density on ionizations and recombinations .    to describe the ionization dynamics of wdm more systematically ,",
    "we here propose and analyse a monte - carlo approach that can be configured and embedded into existing particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulation codes . in this approach",
    ", we use a collection of macro - particles to describe a plasma of finite ion or matter density . here , a macro - particle can be regarded as the ensemble of real particles , where a macro - particle can be regarded as a group of particles with `` same '' mass , charge state , position and momentum .",
    "the electrons are classified moreover into bound and free ones , where the former are regarded as part of ions or atoms , and the latter are isolated as part of surrounding plasmas . since we consider a collection of large number of particles and the temporal evolution of the system takes place at pico - second scales , the fine structures , such as sub - shell configurations , excitations and their inverse processes , are ignored in the present model .",
    "only the dominant physical processes are are taken into account , i.e. , impact ionization and recombinations .",
    "furthermore , the idp effects , which are determined by plasma density and temperature , should also be taken into account .",
    "this is because the depression of ionization energy of ions or atoms by the ipd effects will then , in turn , affect both impact ionization and recombination processes .",

    "the average ionization degree of bulk aluminium varying with temperature is calculated by the pic code , which shows good agreement with the data provied by flychk code .",
    "furthermore , we also explore the ionization dynamics of alloys in this section .",
    "summary and discussion are given in sec .",
    "when temperature of plasma is high with the kinetic energy of free electrons exceeding the ionization potential of ions or atoms , there exists a possibility that the ion or atom will lose a bound electron by the colliding with energetic free electrons , and we call this process as impact ionization .",
    "simultaneously , for cold and dense plasmas , free electrons and charged ions tend to recombine together , and we call this process as electron - ion recombination . different from isolated atom or ion , the debye screening of free electrons would dramatically influence the atomic structure of ions that embedded in dense plasmas , resulting in the lowering of the ionization potential .",
    "the above three processes are usually ignored in high temperature and low density plasmas , such as laser wake field acceleration .",
    "while for dense plasma and warm dense matter regime , they are so important that become the dominant processes of the considered system . in this section , an impact ionization model based on electron - ion collisional cross sections , an electron - ion recombination model based on three - body - recombination and",
    "the ipd effects based on stewart s theory are explored and implemented in pic simulations .",

    "let us note , however , the fine structure levels are ignored in lotz s model , for which the ionization stage is treated as from the ground state to the next ground state .",
    "furthermore , the electron impact ionization cross section can also be calculated using the relativistic multi - configuration flexible atomic code ( fac ) @xcite , where multitude of ionization cross sections can be generated by the fac between the fine structure levels of the initial and final states , and finally combined into a single effective cross section as obtained from a summation over the initial and average over the final states .",

    "in particular , the recombination of electrons and ions takes place mainly by three different reaction modes , the dielectronic ( dr ) , radiative ( rr ) and three - body recombinations ( tbr ) , respectively @xcite .",
    "as we have analysed , in our model only ground state of ions and atoms are concerned , the contributions of dr are averaged out .",
    "note that , rr is the inverse of the direct photo - ionization , while tbr is the inverse process of electron impact ionization .",
    "the rr process is known to predominantly fill the low - lying redberg states , while tbr is mainly responsible in rapidly bringing the high rydberg states into equilibrium @xcite .",
