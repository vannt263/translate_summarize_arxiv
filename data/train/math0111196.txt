    "complicated combinatorial problems often arise when one studies the homological properties of strata in some topological space with a  given natural stratification . in this paper , we study the symmetric smash products stratified by point multiplicities .",
    "more specifically , let @xmath1 be a  pointed topological space ( we refer to the base point as a  point at infinity ) , and denote @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the smash product of pointed spaces .",
    "in other words , @xmath4 is the set of all unordered collections of @xmath0 points on @xmath1 with the collections having at least one of the points at infinity identified , to form a  new infinity point .",
    "@xmath4 is naturally stratified by point coincidences , and the strata are indexed by the number partitions of @xmath0 .",
    "note that we consider the closed strata , so , for example , the stratum indexed @xmath5 is the whole space @xmath4 .    the main open stratum , that is the complement of the closed stratum @xmath6 , is a  frequently studied object .",
    "it was suggested by arnold in a  much more general context , see for example  @xcite , that in situations of this kind one should study the problem for all closed strata .",
    "the main argument in support of this point of view is that there is usually no natural stratification on the main open stratum , while there is one on its complement , also known as discriminant .",
    "having a  natural stratification allows one to apply such computational techniques , as spectral sequences , in a  canonical way .",
    "once some information has been obtained about the closed strata , one can try to find out something about the open stratum by means of some kind of duality .    if one specifies @xmath7 , resp .",
    "@xmath8 , one obtains as strata the spaces of all monic real hyperbolic , resp .",
    "monic complex , polynomials of degree  n with specified root multiplicities .",
    "these spaces naturally appear in singularity theory , @xcite .",
    "homological invariants of several of these strata were in particular computed by arnold , shapiro , sundaram , welker , vassiliev , and the author , see  @xcite .",
    "these are the special cases which have inspired this general study .    here , we take a different , more abstract look at this set of problems . more specifically , the idea is to introduce a  new canonical combinatorial object , independent of topology of particular @xmath1 , where the combinatorial aspects of these stratifications would be fully reflected .",
    "this object is a  certain category , which we name the * resonance category*. it was suggested to the author by b.  shapiro ,  @xcite , to use the term _ resonance _ as a  generic reference to a  certain type of linear relations among parts of a  number partition .",
    "having this canonically defined category at hand , one then can , for each specific topological space @xmath1 , view the natural stratification of @xmath4 as a  certain functor from the resonance category to @xmath9 .",
    "these functors satisfy a  system of axioms , which we take as a  definition of * resonance functors*. the combinatorial structures in the resonance category will then project to the corresponding structures in each specific @xmath4 .",
    "this opens the door to develop the general combinatorial theory of the resonance category , and then prove facts valid for all resonance functors satisfying some further conditions , such as for example acyclicity of certain spaces .",
    "the main combinatorial structure inside the resonance category , which we study , is that of _ relative resonances _ and their direct products .",
    "intuitively , a  relative resonance encodes the combinatorial type of a  stratum with a  union of some substrata shrunk to form the new infinity point .",
    "these spaces appear naturally if we are trying to compute the homology groups of our strata by means of long exact sequences , or , more generally , spectral sequences .",
    "our idea is that the combinatorial knowledge of which relative resonances are _ reducible _ ( that is , are direct products of other relative resonances ) , serves as a  guidance for which long exact sequences one is to consider for the actual homology computations .",
    "this way , the arnold problem of computing the algebraic invariants of the strata , splits into two parts : the combinatorial one , embodied by various structures in the resonance category , such as the relative resonances , and the topological one , reflecting the specific properties of  @xmath1 .",
    "our notions of sequential and strongly sequential resonances are intended to capture the combinatorial structure of those resonances , which are particularly compatible with the spectral sequence computations .",
    "this , in turn , leads to the natural notion of complexity of resonances .    as mentioned above , to illustrate a  possible appearance of this abstract framework we choose to use a  class of topological spaces which come in particular from the singularity theory , and whose topological properties have been studied : spaces of polynomials ( real or complex ) with prescribed root multiplicities . in particular , in case of strata @xmath10 , which were studied in @xcite for the complex case , and in @xcite for the real case , we demonstrate how the inherent combinatorial structure of the resonance category makes this particular resonance especially reducible .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :    * section 2 .",
    "* we introduce the notion of resonance category , and describe the structure of its set of morphisms .    * section 3 .",
    "* we introduce the notions of relative resonances , direct products of relative resonances , and resonance functors .",
    "* section 4 . *",
    "we formulate the problem of arnold and shapiro which motivated this research as that concerning a  specific resonance functor .",
    "then , we analyze the combinatorial structure of resonances @xmath11 , which leads to the complete determination of the homotopy types of the corresponding strata for @xmath7 .",
    "* section 5 . *",
    "we analyze the combinatorial structure of the sequential and strongly sequential resonances . for @xmath7",
    ", this leads to the complete computation of homotopy types of the strata corresponding to resonances @xmath12 , such that @xmath13 . next , we consider division chain resonances , which constitute a  vast generalization of the case @xmath14 .",
    "we prove , that in this case the strata always have a homotopy type of a  bouquet of spheres .",
    "we describe a  combinatorial model to enumerate these spheres as paths in a certain weighted directed graph , with dimensions of the spheres being given by the total weights of the paths .    * section 6 . *",
    "we introduce the notion of a complexity of a  resonance and give a  series of examples of resonances having arbitrarily high complexity .",
