    "exceptions are @xcite .",
    "this paper aims at developing a quasi - bayesian analysis of the npiv model , with a focus on the asymptotic properties of quasi - posterior distributions .",
    "the approach taken is quasi - bayes in the sense that it neither needs to assume any specific distribution of @xmath0 , nor has to put a nonparametric prior on the unknown likelihood function .",
    "the analysis is then based upon a quasi - likelihood induced from the conditional moment restriction .",
    "the quasi - likelihood is constructed by first estimating the conditional moment function @xmath25 $ ] in a nonparametric way , and taking @xmath26 as if it were a likelihood of @xmath27 .",
    "for this quasi - likelihood , we put a prior on the function - valued parameter @xmath27 . by doing so ,",
    "formally , the posterior distribution for @xmath27 may be defined , which we call `` quasi - posterior distribution . ''",
    "this posterior corresponds to what @xcite called `` gibbs posterior , '' and has a substantial interpretation ( see proposition [ prop0 ] ahead ) .",
    "the quasi - bayesian approach in this paper builds upon @xcite where the dimension of the parameter of interest is finite and fixed .",
    "we focus here on priors constructed on slowly growing finite - dimensional sieves ( called `` sieve or series priors '' ) , where the dimensions of the sieve spaces ( which grow with the sample size ) play the role of regularization to deal with the problem of ill - posedness .",
    "potentially , there are several choices in sieve spaces , but we choose to use wavelet bases to form sieve spaces .",
    "wavelet bases are useful to treat smoothness function classes such as hlder  zygmund and sobolev spaces in a unified and convenient way .",
    "we also use wavelet series estimation of the conditional moment function .. ]    under this setup , we study the asymptotic properties of the quasi - posterior distribution .",
    "the results obtained are summarized as follows .",
    "first , we derive rates of contraction for the quasi - posterior distribution and establish conditions on priors under which the minimax optimal rate of contraction is attained . here",
    "the contraction is stated in the standard @xmath20-norm .",
    "second , we show asymptotic normality of the quasi - posterior of the first @xmath28 generalized fourier coefficients , where @xmath29 is the dimension of the sieve space .",
    "this may be viewed as a nonparametric bernstein ",
    "von mises type result ( see @xcite , chapter 10 , for the classical bernstein ",
    "von mises theorem for regular parametric models ) .",
    "third , we derive rates of convergence of the quasi - bayes estimator defined by the posterior expectation and show that under some conditions it attains the minimax optimal rate of convergence .",
    "finally , we give some specific sieve priors for which the quasi - posterior distribution ( the quasi - bayes estimator ) attains the minimax optimal rate of contraction ( convergence , resp . ) .",
    "these results greatly sharpen the previous work of , for example , @xcite , as we will review below .      closely related are @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the former paper worked on the reduced form equation @xmath30 + v$ ] with @xmath31 $ ] and assumed @xmath32 to be normally distributed .",
    "they considered a gaussian prior on @xmath27 , and the posterior distribution is also gaussian ( conditionally on the variance of @xmath32 ) .",
    "they proposed to `` regularize '' the posterior and studied the asymptotic properties of the `` regularized '' posterior distribution and its expectation .",
    "clearly , the present paper largely differs from @xcite in that ( i ) we do not assume normality of the `` error '' ; ( ii ) roughly speaking , florens and simoni s method is tied with the tikhonov regularization method , while ours is tied with the sieve - based method with slowly growing sieves .",
    "we note the settings of @xcite are largely different from the present paper ; moreover in the npiv example , some high - level conditions on estimated operators are assumed in , and hence they are not directly comparable to the present paper .",
    "liao and jiang @xcite developed an important unified framework in estimating conditional moment restriction models based on a quasi - bayesian approach , and their scope is more general than ours .",
    "they analyzed npiv models in detail in their section  4 .",
    "their posterior construction is similar to ours such as the use of sieve priors , but differs from ours in detail .",
    "for example , @xcite transformed the conditional moment restriction into unconditional moment restrictions with increasing number of restrictions . on the other hand , we directly work on the conditional moment restriction , although whether liao and jiang s approach will lose any efficiency in the frequentist sense is not formally clear .    importantly and substantially ,",
    "neither @xcite nor @xcite established sharp contraction rates for their ( quasi-)posterior distributions , nor asymptotic normality results .",
    "it is unclear whether florens and simoni s @xcite rates ( in their theorem 2 ) are optimal , since their assumptions are substantially different from the past literature such as @xcite and @xcite ; moreover , strictly speaking @xcite did not formally derive contraction rates for their regularized posterior when the operator is unknown ( note that @xcite , though not directly comparable to the present paper , also did not formally derive posterior contraction rates in the npiv example ) .",
    "liao and jiang @xcite only established posterior consistency .",
    "here we focus on a simple but important model , and establish the sharper asymptotic results for the quasi - posterior distribution .",
    "notably , a wide class of ( finite dimensional ) sieve priors is shown to lead to the optimal contraction rate .",
    "moreover , in @xcite , a point estimator of the structural function is not formally analyzed .",
    "hence , the primal contribution of this paper is to considerably deepen the understanding of the asymptotic properties of the quasi - bayesian procedure for the npiv model .    the present paper deals with a quasi - bayesian analysis of an infinite - dimensional model .",
    "the literature on theoretical studies of bayesian analysis of infinite - dimensional models is large .",
    "see @xcite for general contraction rates for posterior distributions in infinite - dimensional models .",
    "note that these results do not directly apply to our case : the proof of the main general theorem ( theorem [ thm1 ] ) depends on the construction of suitable `` tests '' ( see the proof of proposition [ propa1 ] ) , but how to construct such tests in a specific problem in a nonlikelihood framework is not trivial , especially in the current npiv model where we have to deal with the ill - posedness of inverse problem .",
    "moreover , proposition [ propa1 ] alone is not sufficient for obtaining sharp contraction rates and an additional work is needed ( see the proof of theorem [ thm1 ] ) .",
    "there is also a large literature on the bayesian analysis of ( ill - posed ) inverse problems .",
    "one stream of research on this topic lies in the applied mathematics literature ; see @xcite and references therein",
    ". however , their models and scopes are substantially different from those of the present paper ; for example , @xcite considered ( ill - conditioned ) finite - dimensional linear regression models with gaussian errors and priors , and contractions rates of posterior distributions are not formally studied there . in the statistics literature , we may refer to @xcite ( in addition to @xcite that are already discussed ) , although their results are not applicable to the analysis of npiv models because of its particular structure ( i.e. , especially the operator @xmath12 is unknown , and non - gaussian `` errors '' and priors are allowed ) .",
    "hence the present paper provides a further contribution to the bayesian analysis of ill - posed inverse problems .",
    "our asymptotic normality result builds upon the previous work on asymptotic normality of ( quasi-)posterior distributions for models with increasing number of parameters @xcite .",
    "related is @xcite , in which the author established bernstein ",
    "von mises theorems for gaussian regression models with increasing number of regressors and improved upon the earlier work of @xcite in several aspects .",
    "reference @xcite covered nonparametric models by taking into account modeling bias in the analysis . however , none of these papers covered the npiv model , nor more generally linear inverse problems .",
    "finally , while we here assume injectivity of the operator @xmath12 in ( [ npiv2 ] ) , as one of anonymous referees pointed out , this condition is not a trivial assumption ( see also the discussion after assumption [ a2 ] in section [ secassumption ] ) , and there are a number of works that relax the injectivity assumption and explore partial identification approach , such as @xcite and @xcite , appendix a.      the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",

    "in this section , we outline a quasi - bayesian analysis of the npiv model ( [ npiv ] ) .",
    "the discussion here is informal .",
    "the formal discussion is given in section [ secmain ] .",
    "let @xmath60 be a parameter space ( say , some smoothness class of functions , such as a hlder  zygmund or sobolev space ) , for which we assume @xmath61 .",
    "we assume that @xmath62 is at least contained in @xmath50 $ ] : @xmath63 $ ] .",

    "so a bayesian analysis in the standard sense is not applicable here since a proper likelihood for @xmath27 ( @xmath27 is a generic version of @xmath11 ) is not available .",
    "instead , we use a quasi - likelihood induced from the conditional moment restriction ( [ moment ] ) .",
    "let @xmath67 be i.i.d .",
    "observations of @xmath0 .",

    "however , this @xmath71 is infeasible since @xmath72 is unknown . instead of using @xmath71 ,",
    "we replace @xmath72 by a suitable estimate @xmath73 and use the quasi - likelihood of the form @xmath74 \\bigr\\}.\\ ] ] below we use a wavelet series estimator of @xmath72 .",
    "the quasi - bayesian analysis considered here uses this quasi - likelihood as if it were a proper likelihood and puts priors on @xmath75 . in this paper , as in @xcite , we shall use sieve priors ( more precisely , priors constructed on slowly growing sieves ; @xcite  indeed considered another class of priors , see their supplementary material ) . the basic idea is to construct a sequence of finite - dimensional sieves ( say , @xmath76 ) that well approximates the parameter space @xmath60 ( i.e. , each function in @xmath60 is well approximated by some function in @xmath76 as @xmath77 becomes large ) , and put priors concentrating on these sieves .",
    "each sieve space is a subset of a linear space spanned by some basis functions .",
    "hence the problem reduces to putting priors on the coefficients on those basis functions .",
    "such priors are typically called `` ( finite dimensional ) sieve priors '' ( or `` series priors '' ) and have been widely used in the nonparametric bayesian and quasi - bayesian analysis ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath78 be a so - constructed prior on @xmath75 .",
    "then , formally , the posterior - like distribution of @xmath27 given @xmath79 may be defined by @xmath80 which we call `` quasi - posterior distribution . ''",
    "the quasi - posterior distribution is not a proper posterior distribution in the strict bayesian sense since @xmath81 is not a proper likelihood .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath82 is a proper distribution , that is , @xmath83 .",
    "similar to proper posterior distributions , contraction of the quasi - posterior distribution around @xmath11 intuitively means that it contains more and more accurate information about the true structural function @xmath11 as the sample size increases .",
    "hence , as in proper posterior distributions , it is of fundamental importance to study rates of contraction of quasi - posterior distributions .",
    "here we say that the quasi - posterior @xmath84 contracts around @xmath11 at rate @xmath85 if @xmath86 .",
    "this quasi - posterior corresponds to what @xcite called `` gibbs algorithm '' and what @xcite called `` gibbs posterior . ''",
    "the framework of the quasi - posterior ( gibbs posterior ) allows us a flexibility since a stringent distributional assumption , such as normality , on the data generating process is not required .",
    "such a framework widens a bayesian approach to broad fields of statistical problems . ] a foundation for understanding the statistical behavior of the gibbs posterior , which we believe will open a productive new line of research . '' ] moreover , the following proposition gives an interesting interpretation of the quasi - posterior .",

    "this gives a rational to use @xmath98 as a quasi - posterior since , among all possible `` quasi - posteriors '' , this @xmath98 optimally balances the average of the natural loss function @xmath99 and its complexity ( or deviation ) relative to the initial prior distribution measured by the kullback ",

    "it is not difficult to see that the theory below can be extended to the case where @xmath100 is even random , as long as @xmath100 converges in probability to a fixed positive constant .",
    "however , for the sake of simplicity , we take @xmath97 as a benchmark choice ( note that as long as @xmath100 is a fixed positive constant , the analysis can be reduced to the case with @xmath101 by renormalization ) .",

    "see , for example , @xcite where the `` limited information likelihood '' is derived as the `` best '' ( in a suitable sense ) approximation to the true likelihood function under a set of moment restrictions and the bayesian analysis with the limited information likelihood is argued ( @xcite adapted this approach to conditional moment restriction models ) , and @xcite where a version of the empirical likelihood is interpreted in a bayesian framework .",

    "it is not difficult to see that the results naturally extend to the case where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are vectors with the same dimension , by considering tensor product sieves ( the contraction / convergence rates will then deteriorate as the dimension grows ) .",

    ", the analysis can be reduced to the case where there are no exogenous variables by conditioning on @xmath521 ( so the sieve measure of ill - posedness can be defined by the one conditional on @xmath521 ) .",

    "when @xmath494 is continuously distributed , then @xmath525 can be estimated by using observations @xmath523 for which @xmath495 is `` close '' to @xmath36 ; one way is to use kernel weights as in section 4.2 of @xcite .",
    "however , the detailed analysis of this case is not presented here for brevity .",
    "finally , we make some remarks on the direction of future research .",
    "first , as also noted by @xcite , ( adaptive ) selection of the resolution level @xmath140 in a ( quasi-)bayesian or `` empirical '' bayesian approach is an important topic to be investigated .",
    "second , a ( quasi-)bayesian analysis is typically useful in the analysis of complex models in which frequentist estimation is difficult to implement due to nondifferentiability / nonconvex nature of loss functions .",
    "this usefulness comes from the fact that a ( quasi-)bayesian approach is typically able to avoid numerical optimization .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for the finite - dimensional case . in infinite - dimensional models ,",
    "such a computational challenge in frequentist estimation occurs in the analysis of nonparametric instrumental quantile regression models @xcite . in that model ,",
    "a typical loss function contains the indicator function and hence highly nonconvex .",
    "in such a case , the computation of an optimal solution is by itself difficult , and a solution obtained , if possible , is typically not guaranteed to be globally optimal since there may be many local optima .",
    "it is hence of interest to extend the results of the paper to nonparametric instrumental quantile regression models .",
    "the extension to the quantile regression case , which is currently under investigation , is highly nontrivial since the problem of estimating the structural function becomes a _ nonlinear _ ill - posed inverse problem and a delicate care of the stochastic expansion of the criterion function is needed .",

    "he would like to thank professor victor chernozhukov for his suggestions and encouragements , as well as professor yukitoshi matsushita for his constructive comments .",
    "also he would like to thank the editor , professor runze li , the associate editor , and anonymous referees for their insightful comments that helped improve on the quality of the paper ."
