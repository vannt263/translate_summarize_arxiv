    "a major goal in quantum information theory is to understand the advantage over classical protocols that can be achieved by allowing quantum protocols . for a given information processing task , identifying the optimal success rate for this task",
    "can be seen as an optimization over the set of valid protocols .",
    "the quantum advantage is then defined as the increase in the optimal value by allowing a larger set of protocols that make use of quantum theory .",
    "a family of tasks for which such an advantage is very well - studied is the family of games between multiple parties that are not allowed to communicate .",
    "as was first demonstrated by bell  @xcite , there exist games for which entanglement between the players can increase the success probability beyond the ultimate limit of classical protocols .",
    "the fundamental limit for classical protocols is called a bell inequality and its violation indicates an important feature of quantum theory called non - locality .",
    "the topic of non - locality has been a very active topic in quantum information theory and in the foundations of quantum mechanics ; see  @xcite for a review . a quantum advantage can also be studied in many other settings including communication complexity  @xcite , communication over a classical channel  @xcite or randomness extractors  @xcite .",
    "one objective of this paper is to formulate many of these problems in a unified language as bilinear optimization programs .    to make the discussion more concrete",
    ", we consider a specific example .",
    "let @xmath0 be a noisy channel mapping system @xmath1 to system @xmath2 .",
    "assuming @xmath1 and @xmath2 are discrete systems , we can describe the channel by the transition probabilities @xmath3 from @xmath4 to @xmath5 for all @xmath6 .",
    "the goal is to send @xmath7 bits of information using this channel while minimizing the error probability for the decoding .",
    "a valid protocol in this setting is given by an encoding function @xmath8 \\to x$ ] and a decoding function @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "to take into account the possibility of a randomized functions , we describe the encoder by a probability distribution @xmath10 on @xmath1 for every possible input @xmath11 $ ] , and similarly the decoder by a distribution @xmath12 on @xmath13 $ ] for every @xmath14 .",
    "given an encoder and a decoder , the average success probability of our protocol can be expressed as @xmath15 . in summary , optimizing the success probability of information transmission is captured by the following bilinear program @xmath16 \\\\ &   & & \\sum_{i } d(i|y ) = 1 \\quad \\forall y \\in y \\\\ &   & & 0 \\leq e(x|i ) \\leq 1 \\quad \\forall ( x , i ) \\in x \\times [ 2^k ] \\\\   & & & 0 \\leq d(i|y ) \\leq 1 \\quad \\forall ( i , y ) \\in [ 2^k ] \\times y\\ , .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] observe that allowing the encoder and the decoder to access ( unlimited ) shared randomness does not change the optimal value of this program .",
    "a fundamental question is to study the effected of shared entanglement for communication .",
    "it is not possible to communicate only using shared entanglement between the sender and the receiver .",
    "however , shared entanglement can offer important advantages for communication if we already have a quantum channel  @xcite or even a classical channel  @xcite .",
    "the latter is the setting we consider here .",
    "a quantum protocol is described by a hilbert space @xmath17 ( of arbitrary dimension ) , a unit vector ( called state ) @xmath18 shared between the encoder and the decoder , and positive operator - valued measures on @xmath17 for the encoder @xmath19 for each @xmath11 $ ] and for the decoder @xmath20 for each @xmath14 . in the quantum setting ,",

    "any feasible solution for is also a feasible solution for .",
    "allowing for quantum protocols also leads to the definition of quantum graph parameters  @xcite .",
    "for example , the stability number of a graph @xmath27 can be viewed in terms of the success probability of a two - prover game depending on @xmath27 , or in terms of the success probability for information transmission over a noisy channel defined by @xmath27 . allowing quantum protocols in these tasks",
    "naturally leads to the definition of quantum stability numbers of a graph . to study such quantum graph parameters , laurent and piovesan  @xcite recently introduced a non - commutative analog of the completely positive cone @xmath28 called the completely positive semidefinite cone @xmath29 . for the aforementioned problems , the set of quantum strategies",
    "can then be described using @xmath29 , and the quantum advantage is witnessed by the fact @xmath29 is larger than @xmath28 .",
    "having phrased the setup , let us now give a short overview of our findings .",
    "we start by phrasing problems like the ones stated above as optimization programs .",
    "more precisely , we study the class of tasks that can be described by optimizing a bilinear function subject to linear inequalities .",
    "the optimization over classical protocols corresponds to a program similar to with commutative ( scalar ) variables , whereas the optimization over quantum protocols corresponds to allowing the variables to be operator - valued as in  .",
    "as it appears from the expression , optimization over quantum protocol seems quite complicated .",
    "in fact , as there is no bound on the dimension of the hilbert space , it is not known whether the optimal value is even computable . in the context of games , navascus , pironio and acn ( npa )  @xcite",
    "introduced a family of semidefinite programming ( sdp ) relaxations that give efficiently computable upper bounds on quantum bilinear programs .",
    "this hierarchy was shown to asymptotically converge to the optimal quantum protocol  @xcite .",
    "these hierarchies can be seen as non - commutative versions of the sum - of - squares hierarchies introduced by lasserre and parrilo  @xcite .",
    "our first contribution is the observation that many information processing tasks can be formulated in this way .",
    "we believe that phrasing these seemingly different problems in a unified language will help in our understanding of each one of these problems .",
    "moreover , we think that tools developed in the context of optimization should be valuable in characterizing the power and limitations of quantum protocols . our second contribution is to give a new hierarchy of sdps that gives upper bounds on quantum bilinear programs .",
    "compared to the previous contributions  @xcite , our hierarchy has some additional constraints which we illustrate to be useful in several settings .",
    "for example , the first level of our hierarchy has the nice property of being naturally bounded by the maximal value of the general problem , i.e. , it is bounded by one for the case of channel coding discussed above .",
    "in addition , by means of a specific example , we show that our sdps can give better bounds in practice .",
    "the new constraints are also important to study the completely positive semidefinite cone @xmath29 , which consists of all the symmetric matrices that admit a gram representation by positive semidefinite matrices of any size .",
    "in fact , we show that these constraints lead to a natural hierarchy of sdp outer approximations for the completely positive semidefinite cone @xmath29 .      in section  [ sec : quantum ]",
    ", we introduce the general setup of quantum bilinear optimization and present our new hierarchy of sdps .",
    "we keep the main text elementary and only prove that our sdps give upper bounds on the quantum programs when the hilbert space is finite - dimensional ( the infinite - dimensional case as well as the convergence of the hierarchy are deferred to appendices ) . in section  [ sec : examples ] , we describe applications to two - prover games , channel coding , randomness extractors as well as to the optimization over the completely positive semidefinite cone .",
    "as motivated in   we would like to start from the following type of ( classical ) bilinear optimization program with real variables @xmath30 for @xmath31{:=}\\{1,\\ldots , n\\}$ ] and @xmath32 for @xmath33{:=}\\{1,\\ldots , m\\}$ ] , ] @xmath34{:=}\\;&\\underset{(z_\\alpha , y_\\beta)}{\\text{maximize } } & & \\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta } a_{\\alpha,\\beta } z_\\alpha y_\\beta   \\\\ & \\text{subject to } & & g(z_1,\\dots , z_n ) \\geq 0 \\quad \\forall g\\in\\cg\\\\ & & & k(y_1,\\dots , y_m ) \\geq 0 \\quad \\forall k\\in\\ck\\ , .",

    "this takes into account the most general formulation of quantum mechanics  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for a quantum information theory reference ) .",
