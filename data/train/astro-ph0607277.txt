    "young neutron stars ( ages @xmath7  years ) are observed to have surface magnetic fields in the range of @xmath8-@xmath9  g @xcite , far beyond the reach of terrestrial laboratories @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the properties of matter can be drastically modified by such strong magnetic fields .",
    "the natural atomic unit for the magnetic field strength , @xmath10 , is set by equating the electron cyclotron energy @xmath11  kev , where @xmath12 , to the characteristic atomic energy @xmath13  ev ( where @xmath14 is the bohr radius ) : b_0=m_e^2e^3c^3=2.350510 ^ 9 g. [ eqb0 ] for @xmath15 , the usual perturbative treatment of the magnetic effects on matter ( e.g. , zeeman splitting of atomic energy levels ) does not apply .",
    "instead , in the transverse direction ( perpendicular to the field ) the coulomb forces act as a perturbation to the magnetic forces , and the electrons in an atom settle into the ground landau level . because of the extreme confinement of the electrons in the transverse direction , the coulomb force becomes much more effective in binding the electrons along the magnetic field direction .",
    "the atom attains a cylindrical structure .",
    "moreover , it is possible for these elongated atoms to form molecular chains by covalent bonding along the field direction .",
    "interactions between the linear chains can then lead to the formation of three - dimensional condensed matter @xcite .",
    "this paper is the second in a series where we present calculations of matter in strong magnetic fields using density functional theory . in @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) , we studied various atoms and molecules in magnetic fields ranging from @xmath16  g to @xmath17  g for h , he , c , and fe , representative of the most likely neutron star surface compositions .",
    "numerical results and fitting formulae of the ground - state energies were given for h@xmath18 ( up to @xmath19 ) , he@xmath18 ( up to @xmath20 ) , c@xmath18 ( up to @xmath21 ) , and fe@xmath18 ( up to @xmath22 ) , as well as for various ionized atoms .",
    "it was found that as @xmath3 increases , molecules become increasingly more bound relative to individual atoms , and that the binding energy per atom in a molecule , @xmath23 , generally increases and approaches a constant value with increasing @xmath24 . in this paper , we present density - functional - theory calculations of infinite chains of h , he , c , and fe .",
    "our goal is to obtain the cohesive energy of such one - dimensional ( 1d ) condensed matter relative to individual atoms for a wide range of field strengths .",
    "we also carry out approximate calculations of the relative binding energy between 1d chains and three - dimensional ( 3d ) condensed matter at zero pressure .",
    "the cohesive property of matter in strong magnetic fields is a fundamental quantity characterizing magnetized neutron star surface layers , which play a key role in many neutron star processes and observed phenomena .",
    "the cohesive energy refers to the energy required to pull an atom out of the bulk condensed matter at zero pressure .",
    "theoretical models of pulsar and magnetar magnetospheres depend on the cohesive properties of the surface matter in strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "for example , depending on the cohesive energy of the surface matter , an acceleration zone ( `` polar gap '' ) above the polar cap of a pulsar may or may not form , and this will affect pulsar radio emission and other high - energy emission processes . also , while a hot or warm neutron star most certainly has a gaseous atmosphere that mediates its thermal emission , condensation of the stellar surface may occur at sufficiently low temperatures @xcite .",
    "for example , radiation from a bare condensed surface ( with no atmosphere above it ) has been invoked to explain the nearly perfect blackbody emission spectra observed in some nearby isolated neutron stars @xcite . however , whether surface condensation actually occurs depends on the cohesive energy of the surface matter .",
    "there have been few quantitative studies of infinite chains and zero - pressure condensed matter in strong magnetic fields . earlier variational calculations @xcite as well as calculations based on thomas - fermi type statistical models @xcite , while useful in establishing scaling relations and providing approximate energies of the atoms and the condensed matter , are not adequate for obtaining reliable energy differences ( cohesive energies ) .",
    "quantitative results for the energies of infinite chains of hydrogen molecules h@xmath2 in a wide range of field strengths ( @xmath25 ) were presented in both ref .",

    "@xcite for some results of he@xmath2 ) and ref .",
    "@xcite ( using density functional theory ) . for heavier elements such as c and fe ,",
    "the cohesive energies of 1d chains have only been calculated at a few magnetic field strengths in the range of @xmath0-@xmath26  g , using hartree - fock models @xcite and density functional theory @xcite .",
    "there were discrepancies between the results of these works , and some ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) adopted a crude treatment for the band structure ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : complex ] ) .",
    "an approximate calculation of 3d condensed matter based on density functional theory was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our calculations of atoms and small molecules ( paper i ) and of infinite chains and condensed matter ( this paper ) are based on density functional theory @xcite . in the strong field regime where the electron spins are aligned with each other ,",
    "the hartree - fock method is expected to be highly accurate @xcite .",
    "however , in dealing with systems with many electrons , it becomes increasingly impractical as the magnetic field increases , since more and more landau orbitals ( even though electrons remain in the ground landau level ) are occupied and keeping track of the direct and exchange interactions between electrons in various orbitals becomes computational rather tedious .",
    "our density - functional calculations allow us to obtain the energies of atoms and small molecules and the energy of condensed matter using the same method , thus providing reliable cohesive energy values for condensed surfaces of magnetic neutron stars , a main goal of our study .",
    "compared to previous density - functional theory calculations @xcite , we use an improved exchange - correlation function appropriate for highly magnetized electron gases , we calibrate our density - functional code with previous results ( when available ) based on other methods , and ( for calculations of condensed matter ) adopt a more accurate treatment of the band structure . moreover , our calculations extend to the magnetar - like field regime ( @xmath27  g ) .    this paper is organized as follows .",

    "the only previous calculation using the hartree - fock method @xcite adopted an approximate treatment for the electron band structure ( e.g. , assuming that the electron energy increases as @xmath257 as the bloch wave number @xmath91 increases ) , which , as we showed in this paper ( sec .  [ subsec : complex ] ) , likely resulted in appreciable error to the total chain energy . since the cohesive energy @xmath75 of the chain involves the difference in the binding energy the 1d chain and the atom , and because of the statistical nature of density functional theory , we expect that our result for @xmath75 is more accurate for heavy elements ( c and fe ) than for light elements ( h and he ) .",

    "this `` discrepancy '' is understandable since , unlike the @xmath263 case , in strong magnetic fields the ionization of an atom and binding energy of condensed matter can be very different in values and have different dependences on @xmath3 : for sufficiently large @xmath3 , the former scales roughly as @xmath264 , while the later scales as @xmath265 .",
