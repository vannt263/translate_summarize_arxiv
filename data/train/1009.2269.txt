    "the latest generation of tev gamma - ray telescopes have enabled detections of increasing numbers of tev sources over the past several years , as well as improved measurements of spectra and variability in previously established sources .",
    "most of the extragalactic sources detected at these tev energies ( currently 23 of 36 sources ) are high - frequency - peaked bl lac objects , or hbls , a subclass of blazar whose synchrotron and inverse - compton spectra peak at high frequencies .",
    "the blazar phenomenon as a whole is now well understood to result from a relativistically moving jet of plasma directed nearly at the observer , but the tev hbls in particular have presented a number of interesting problems .    the strong variability found in at least two of these blazars : pks  2155@xmath0304 ( aharonian et al . 2007 ) and mrk  501 ( albert et al . 2007 ) , on time - scales as short as a few minutes ( considerably shorter than the shortest time - scales expected ) , provoked considerable interest .",
    "modeling of this variability has implied bulk lorentz factors and doppler factors exceeding 50 ( begelman et al .",
    "2008 ; finke et al .",
    "2008 ) , even extending up to @xmath6 ( kusunose & takahara 2008 ) .",
    "however , other authors employing specific time - dependent or inhomogeneous jet models reproduce the spectra and short variability with lower bulk lorentz factors of about 15 to 30 ( boutelier et al . 2008 ; katarzyski et al . 2008 ) . some authors have proposed decoupling the flare emission from the bulk motion entirely ( ghisellini et al .",
    "2009 ) , by having the flare produced by aligned beams of particles moving at the particle lorentz factor .",
    "even though the most extreme values have usually been invoked to model the variability , moderately high doppler factors are required to reproduce the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the tev blazars in the context of one - zone synchrotron self - compton models .",
    "for example , tavecchio et al .",
    "( 2010 ) find doppler factors in the range of 20 to 40 when modeling the seds of the tev blazars , including the mev ",
    "gev data for those tev blazars detected by _ fermi_.    a major complementary observing technique to use in understanding the physics of the tev blazars is very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) .",
    "vlbi reveals the structure of the parsec - scale jets through direct imaging , rather than from timing or multiwavelength spectral information .",
    "we have been pursuing this strategy with the national radio astronomy observatory s very long baseline array ( vlba ) since the discovery of the tev blazars . as part of this program ,",
    "we have previously studied the parsec - scale structure of mrk  421 ( piner et al .",
    "1999 ; piner & edwards 2005 ) , mrk  501 ( edwards & piner 2002 ; piner et al .",
    "2009 , hereafter p09 ) , and the four sources h  1426 + 428 , 1es  1959 + 650 , pks  2155@xmath0304 , and 1es  2344 + 514 ( piner & edwards 2004 ; piner et al .",
    "2008 , hereafter p08 ) .    along with other workers studying hbls in the radio ( e.g. , giroletti et al .",
    "2004a , 2006 ; wu et al . 2007 ) , we have consistently found that the bulk lorentz factors in the parsec - scale radio jets of tev hbls are fairly modest , @xmath7 to 4 ( see the discussion of this point in p08 , and the discussion of this point for a larger set of hbls , including the tev sources , in giroletti et al .",
    "2004a , 2006 ) .",
    "similarly modest bulk lorentz factors are required by the unification of hbls and fr  i radio galaxies ( chiaberge et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the difference between the high lorentz factors derived from the tev emission ( both from sed modeling and from the variability ) , and the modest lorentz factors found from the compact radio emission and from unification has been dubbed the ` bulk lorentz factor crisis ' ( henri & saug 2006 ) of tev blazars .",
    "the bulk lorentz factor crisis suggests that the tev and radio emission are produced in regions of different lorentz factor , although it is not clear how these two regions may be arranged , and what underlying physics might be responsible .",
    "the slower region could be located downstream of the faster region , implying a decelerating jet ( e.g. , georganopoulos & kazanas 2003 ; levinson 2007 ; stern & poutanen 2008 ) ; note that a decelerating jet also makes sense from energy - budget considerations for this particular class of sources ( celotti & ghisellini 2008 ) .",
    "the slower region could surround a faster central region in a ` spine - sheath ' structure ( ghisellini et al .",
    "such a two component outflow is expected from theoretical models of jet launching ( meliani et al . 2010 and references therein ) . under certain conditions ,",
    "the transverse profile of the lorentz factor may even be nonmonotonic ( aloy & mimica 2008 ) . some of the above models to resolve the bulk lorentz factor crisis ( e.g. , stern & poutanen 2008 ; ghisellini et al .",
    "2005 ) also naturally include _ both _ longitudinal and transverse gradients in the bulk lorentz factor .",
    "alternatively , the fast region could be a smaller sub - structure propagating inside a larger , slower jet .",
    "at least three models propose specific variations of this idea : the ` needle / jet ' model by ghisellini & tavecchio ( 2008 ) , the ` jet in a jet ' model by giannios et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , and the model by lyutikov & lister ( 2010 ) where the leading edge of a non - stationary ejection in a highly magnetized flow is accelerated to much higher lorentz factors than the slower - moving bulk flow .",
    "there is also an alternate class of solution ( e.g. , gopal - krishna et al . 2007 and references therein ) where the slow apparent speeds measured by vlbi result from a broad conical jet viewed almost along the line - of - sight , but this does not resolve the several other indicators of modest beaming in the radio , apart from the apparent jet speeds ( see the discussion of this model in p08 ) .",
    "any longitudinal or transverse velocity structures that exist will in turn affect the computed seds ( e.g. , yang et al .",
    "2009 ) , so any such structures are important to take into account .    because either transverse or longitudinal jet structures in the tev hbls are a common feature of proposed solutions to the bulk lorentz factor crisis , the goals of the vlba observations presented in this paper were to both make detailed observations of transverse structures perpendicular to the jet axes , and to observe the structures closer to the vlbi core than had been possible in our previous observations . because of the need for higher resolution , the majority of the images in this paper are at 43  ghz , as compared to a typical frequency of 15  ghz used in most of our earlier studies of these sources . at 43  ghz ,",
    "the resolution of the vlba is about 0.1  pc at the distance of the closest tev blazars , or about 1,000 schwarzschild radii for a @xmath8 solar mass black hole .",
    "many of the newer and fainter tev hbls are below the vlba s detection limit at 43  ghz ; for this reason this paper concentrates on the six earliest established ( and typically radio brightest ) tev hbls .",
    "even among these sources , a high data rate ( for that time ) of 512 mbps was required for the vlba observations , and some sources were near the vlba s detection limit .    some of these data have been incorporated in various multiwavelength campaigns ; their use in the context of the various multiwavelength campaigns will be described in those papers .",
    "any discussions of radio core variability compared to tev flux variability will also be presented there . a complementary paper on lower - frequency multi - epoch vlba observations of the more recently detected ( and radio fainter )",
    "tev blazars is also in preparation .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in @xmath9  [ obs ] we describe the details of our vlba observations , in @xmath9  [ results ] we present the imaging and model fitting results for specific sources , in @xmath9  [ discussion ] we discuss the physical results obtained for the entire sample , and in @xmath9  [ conclusion ] we present our major conclusions . throughout the paper , we assume cosmological parameters of @xmath10 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "when results from other papers are quoted , they have been converted to this cosmology .",
    "the vlba observations considered in this paper are drawn from three vlba experiments : bp112 during 2005 , be044 during 2006 and 2007 , and bp143 during 2008 and 2009 .",
    "vlba experiment bp112 recorded high - frequency 43 and 86  ghz observations of mrk  421 and mrk  501 at three epochs during 2005 , at a high data rate of 512  mbps .",
    "the bp112 results on mrk  501 have already been reported elsewhere ( p09 ) .",
    "both of these sources were near the vlba s detection limit at 86  ghz ; mrk  501 was detected at its brightest epoch , but mrk  421 was not detected at 86  ghz .",
    "however , images were produced of mrk  421 at 43  ghz at each epoch .",
    "details of the three 43 ghz observations of mrk  421 from vlba experiment bp112 are given in table  [ imtab ] , further details on the reduction of experiment bp112 are given in p09 .",

    "although these rotation measures can increase in the cores at higher frequencies ( jorstad et al .",
    "2007 ; osullivan & gabuzda 2009 ) , the clear and physically significant patterns seen in the transverse polarization structure of the jets ( see @xmath9  [ transverse ] ) argues against a large and variable internal faraday rotation in these jets at 22  ghz .    after final calibration of the visibilities , circular or elliptical gaussian model components were fit to the visibilities using the _ modelfit _ task in difmap .",
    "circular gaussians were used by default , and provided satisfactory fits to the visibilities for all epochs ( as noted by the reduced chi - squared of the fit , and visual inspection of the residual map and visibilities ) . note that model fitting directly to the visibilities allows",
    "sub - beam resolution to be obtained , and components can be clearly identified in the model fitting even when they appear blended with the core component or with each other in the clean images . at some epochs for mrk  421 and mrk  501",
    ", a limb - brightened geometry offered an alternative model fit to circular gaussians .",
    "in such a geometry , the core and each limb of the jet are fit by elliptical gaussians , as was previously done for mrk  501  in p09 .",

    "the circular gaussian models fit to all 23 observations in this paper are given in table  [ mfittab ] .",
    "note that flux values for closely spaced components may be inaccurate , since it is difficult for difmap to uniquely distribute the flux during model fitting .",
    "the model component identification follows the naming scheme used in our previous papers ( e.g. , p08 , components are numbered starting at c1 from the outermost component inwards ) , and since the components have been previously established to be quite slow in these sources , the identification of components across even a time gap of several years turned out to be straightforward .",
    "brightness temperatures are also given in table  [ mfittab ] for all partially resolved core components .",

    "<S> most images were obtained at 43 ghz ( 7  mm ) , and they reveal the parsec - scale structures of three of these sources ( 1es  1959 + 650 , pks  2155@xmath0304 , and 1es  2344 + 514 ) at factors of two to three higher resolution than has previously been attained . </S>",

    "<S> this establishes strong apparent jet bending on vlbi scales as a common property of tev blazars , implying viewing angles close to the line - of - sight . </S>",
    "<S> most of the remaining images map the linear polarization structures at a lower frequency of 22 ghz ( 1  cm ) . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the transverse structures of the jets as revealed by the high - frequency and polarimetric imaging . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse structures include significant limb - brightening in mrk  421 , and ` spine - sheath ' structures in the electric vector position angle ( evpa ) and fractional polarization distributions in mrk  421 , mrk  501 , and 1es  1959 + 650 . </S>",
    "<S> we use new measured component positions to update measured apparent jet speeds , in many cases significantly reducing the statistical error over previously published results . with the increased resolution at 43  ghz </S>",
    "<S> , we detect new components within 0.1 - 0.2 mas of the core in most of these sources . </S>",
    "<S> no motion is apparent in these new components over the time span of our observations , and we place upper limits on the apparent speeds of the components near the core of @xmath1 . from those limits , we conclude that @xmath2 at @xmath3 schwarzschild radii , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the bulk lorentz factors in the tev - emitting and 43  ghz - emitting regions , respectively , assuming that their velocity vectors are aligned . </S>"
