    "entanglement in many - body quantum systems is a subject of a considerable recent interest @xcite . in several physical problems",
    "it is important to describe correlations between two selected parts of a composed quantum system . for any pure state describing the entire system ,",
    "such correlations can be characterized quantitatively by the _ entanglement entropy _ @xmath0 , equal to the von neumann entropy of the reduced mixed state obtained by the partial trace over a selected subsystem .",
    "note that this quantity depends explicitly on the partition of the entire system into subsystems .",
    "entanglement entropy @xmath0 does not usually scale proportionally to the size of the selected region @xmath1 .",
    "as described in @xcite , for different systems the entanglement entropy is approximately proportional to the boundary of this set , denoted by @xmath2 . considering a three dimensional body @xmath1 ,",
    "the size of its boundary is proportional to the _ area _ of @xmath1 and not to its volume .",
    "thus , for any set @xmath1 of subsystems , the size of its boundary @xmath3 will be called the `` area '' of @xmath1 .",
    "if for a sufficiently large system the leading contribution to the entanglement entropy of a given state @xmath4 with respect to the partition @xmath5 is proportional to the area separating both subsystems , we will say that the _ area law _ is satisfied . in the case of one dimensional systems",
    ", the area law implies that the entropy saturates asymptotically to a constant , as the area of the boundary consists of two isolated points .",
    "area laws are studied in context of black hole physics and holographic principle @xcite , and for ground states of quantum lattice systems with local interactions @xcite . under some technical assumptions",
    "is it possible not only to show that the area law holds for the ground state of a given two  dimensional model system , but also to derive the negative correction term called _ topological entanglement entropy _",
    "@xcite , and show that it is universal and depends only on the topology of the interaction .",
    "investigations of the area law were performed also for subsets with fractal boundaries @xcite .    for any quantum state of a system of interacting particles , described by a lattice or a graph , it is interesting to analyze the degree of entanglement between two given nodes of the graph @xcite .",
    "this issue is relevant in studies on generating entanglement between given nodes of a graph @xcite , entanglement swapping and quantum repeater systems @xcite and quantum communications in noisy networks @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to study the area law for the ensembles of random states associated to a graph .",
    "the authors have previously introduced @xcite an ensemble of pure quantum states for which the structure of interactions and entanglement are encoded in the graph . in the present work ,",
    "we study the average entropy of entanglement for elements of this ensemble , and we show that it obeys asymptotically and on average area laws of the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a graph state , @xmath8 is the reduced density operator , @xmath3 is the `` area '' of the boundary of the partition @xmath5 , @xmath9 is the dimension of the subsystems and @xmath10 is a numerical constant depending on the graph @xmath11 and on the partition @xmath5 .",
    "the functionals @xmath12 and @xmath0 denote , respectively , the entropy of entanglement for pure states and the von neumann entropy of mixed density matrices .    in previous work ,",
    "the entanglement entropy for a concrete quantum state of a given composite quantum system ( see e.g. @xcite ) has been investigated .",
    "here however , we discuss the statistical properties of ensembles of quantum states",
    ". we will show under which assumptions the area law holds exactly in our model , while in the opposite case the corrections to the area law are derived .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model of graph random states from @xcite is recalled in section [ sec : random - states ] , and a detailed example is worked out . in section [ sec : adapted ] , the notion of adapted marginals of graph states is introduced and it is shown that for such partitions of the graph the area law holds exactly . a more general case of the problem , for which the area law for random graph states holds only asymptotically is treated in section [ sec : one - vertex ] . in section [ sec :",
    "area - general ] , a definition of the boundary is proposed in the most general setting . the general area law is stated in section [ sec : general ] , while an application to a transport problem is presented in section [ sec : rank - alternative ] .",
    "section [ sec : different - dimensions ] provides an outline of the adjustments to be made to the main results in the case where the dimensions of the relevant hilbert spaces are different .",
    "we recall here the model of _ random graph states _ introduced in @xcite . the most general definition of this model will not be recalled here , but for completeness we sketch below the main ingredients of the construction . for any undirected graph @xmath11 consisting of @xmath13 edges @xmath14 and @xmath15 vertices @xmath16 , we associate an ensemble of random pure states @xmath4 . they describe a quantum system consisting of @xmath17 particles described in the composed hilbert space @xmath18 .",
    "the dimension @xmath9 of any subspace is arbitrary and in particular we will analyze the asymptotic limit @xmath19 .",
    "each edge of the graph , which connects subsystems labeled by @xmath20 and @xmath21 , represents the maximally entangled state , @xmath22 , between two hilbert spaces @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "each vertex @xmath25 of the graph , of degree @xmath26 , represents a generic interaction between @xmath26 subsystems , described by a random unitary matrix of size @xmath27 , distributed according to the _ haar measure_. in this way , _ independent _ random unitary matrices describe unknown interactions in each node , which are assumed to be generic .",
    "the above discussion can be summarized in the following formula , describing an element from the ensemble : @xmath28\\left ( \\bigotimes_{\\{i , j\\ } \\text { edge } }      \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath29 are maximally entangled states and @xmath30 are independent haar unitary operators at each vertex .",
    "our assumptions differ therefore from the model analyzed in @xcite , in which edges of the graph denote maximally entangled states of two qubits , while the vertices represent deterministic local unitary gates or local measurements .",
    "a more general graph model of quantum networks was investigated in @xcite and later studied in context of entanglement percolation @xcite . in this version of the model any edge represents a given bipartite state of two qubits , while a vertex denotes a deterministic unitary swap gate or a local measurement .",
    "note that in the system investigated here each dot at the end of an edge of a graph represents a quantum subsystem described by a @xmath9 dimensional hilbert space .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 is arbitrary , but our results are obtained under the assumption that the dimension is large .",
    "let us divide the set of @xmath17 particles into two disjoint subsets , labeled by @xmath1 and @xmath31 .",
    "the subset @xmath31 will correspond to subsystems over which the averaging is performed : a marginal of the graph state @xmath32 defined by the partial trace over these subsystems , @xmath33 forms a mixed state @xmath8 supported on the remaining subspaces @xmath34 . note that any graph @xmath11 and its partition @xmath35 determines an ensemble of random mixed states @xmath8 .",
    "in @xcite we studied statistical properties of such an ensemble , which depends on the topology of the graph and on its partition .",
    "ensemble of random mixed states can be characterized by the average von neumann entropy @xmath36 . by definition",
    "this quantity is equal to the average entropy of entanglement of the random pure state @xmath4 with respect to the prescribed partition @xmath35 .    as a first example for this graphical notation , consider the graph shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : compatible_ex_simple ] , which consists of @xmath37 edges ( loops and multi - edges are allowed ) and @xmath38 vertices . fig .",
    "[ fig : non - compatible_ex ] shows all @xmath39 subsystems denoted by small black dots and the random interaction between some of them represented by the gray circles at the vertices of the graph .",
    "the partition @xmath40 is indicated graphically by placing diagonal crosses on the small black dots corresponding to elements in @xmath31 ( `` traced subsystems '' ) , while elements in @xmath1 have no crosses on top of them ( `` surviving subsystems '' ) .",
    "let us now consider another example , the graph consisting of a single edge , @xmath41 presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:1-edge - graph ] . the only edge forms a loop here ,",
    "so there is a single vertex @xmath42 only , @xmath43 . the partition splits the @xmath44 partite system into two subsystems @xmath1 and @xmath31 . in this case",
    "we will relax for a moment the assumption that the sizes of both subsystems are equal and will denote them by @xmath9 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "in such a case the only parameter of the model is the ratio between the sizes of both subsystems @xmath46 .",
    "as both subsystems are coupled at the vertex @xmath42 by a random unitary matrix @xmath47 the assumption on the existence of the maximally entangled state becomes irrelevant here .",
    "the partial trace over the subsystem @xmath31 leads to a random mixed state @xmath8 of size @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "it can be represented by a normalized wishart matrix @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is a rectangular non - hermitian random ginibre matrix of size @xmath50 ( recall that a ginibre matrix has i.i.d .",
    "complex gaussian entries ) .",
    "the spectral density of the mixed state @xmath8 of size @xmath9 is known to be described asymptotically by the marchenko ",
    "pastur distribution @xmath51 , in the following sense ( see @xcite for details ) : @xmath52 where the limit corresponds to the weak convergence of probability measures , @xmath53 is the empirical distribution of the rescaled eigenvalues of @xmath8 @xmath54 and the parameter @xmath55 is the asymptotic ratio of dimensions @xmath56 .",

    "we will also consider the general version of the model @xcite , in which only the pairs of subsystems connected by an edge , which describes a maximally entangled state , have the same dimensions .",
    "hilbert spaces of different dimensions , as in the marchenko  pastur case treated above , will be allowed .",
    "however , we shall ask that these dimensions grow at fixed ratios , imposing the asymptotic regime @xmath61 , for some fixed positive constants @xmath62 .",
    "in this section we show that the area law holds _ exactly _ for graph states , provided that the marginal under consideration satisfies a particular condition , called _",
    "adaptability_.    recall that to any graph state we associate two partitions of the set of @xmath17 subspaces : a vertex partition @xmath63 which encodes the vertices of the graph , and a pair partition @xmath64 which encodes the edges ( corresponding to maximally entangled states ) .",
    "more precisely , two subsystems @xmath23 and @xmath24 belong to the same block of @xmath63 if they are attached to the same vertex of the initial graph .",
    "each edge @xmath65 of the graph contributes a block of size two @xmath66 to the edge partition @xmath64 .",
    "recall that a marginal   of a random graph state @xmath32 is specified by a 2-set partition @xmath35 .",
    "a marginal @xmath8 is called _ adapted _ if @xmath67 for the usual refinement order on partitions . in other words , a marginal is adapted if and only if the number of traced out systems in each vertex is either zero or maximal .",
    "if this is the case , then the partition boundary , which splits the graph into parts @xmath68 , does not cross any vertices of the graph .",
    "because of the above property , for adapted marginals , we can speak about _ traced out vertices _ , because if one subsystem of a vertex is traced out , then all the other systems of that vertex are also traced out . for the graph state in figure [ fig : compatible_ex_simple ] we consider the adapted marginal obtained by partial tracing vertices @xmath69 and @xmath70 , see figure [ fig : compatible_ex ] .",
    "we now define precisely what we mean by area laws @xcite .",
    "the partition @xmath71 defines a boundary between the set of vertices that are traced out and vertices that survive . in the subsequent sections",
    ", the following definition will be generalized to take into account non - adapted marginals .",
    "the _ boundary _ of the adapted partition @xmath40 is defined as the set of all ( unoriented ) edges @xmath72 in the graph state with the property that @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "equivalently , it is the set of edges of the type @xmath75 .",
    "the boundary of a partition shall be denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "the _ area _ of this boundary is its cardinality @xmath76 , i.e. the number of edges between @xmath1 and @xmath31 .    in the example of figure [ fig : compatible_ex ] ,",
    "the boundary is represented by a dashed ( green ) line .",
    "the area of the boundary in this case is 5 : in figure [ fig : compatible_ex ] , the boundary line intersects 5 edges .",
    "the main result of this section is that the area law holds _ exactly _ for adapted marginals of graph states , where we allow arbitrary dimensions of subsystem .",
    "note that , for a given ( boundary ) edge @xmath66 , we have @xmath77 , the common dimension of the maximally entangled state corresponding to the edge @xmath66 .",
    "let @xmath8 be an _ adapted _ marginal of a graph state @xmath32 .",
    "then , the entropy of @xmath8 has the following _ exact , deterministic _ value : @xmath78 for each value of the size parameter @xmath9 . in the particular case",
    "where all the hilbert spaces have dimension @xmath9 ( i.e. @xmath79 for all @xmath20 ) , the area law takes the form @xmath80    at fixed @xmath9 , the random density matrix @xmath8 has the following simple expression @xmath81\\left(\\left(\\bigotimes_{\\{i , j\\ } \\in \\pi_\\text{edge}^\\text{in } }   { | \\phi^+_{i , j } \\rangle \\langle \\phi^+_{i , j } | } \\right ) \\otimes \\left(\\bigotimes_{\\{i , j\\ } \\in \\pi_\\text{edge}^\\text{out } } \\frac{\\operatorname{i}_{d_i n}}{d_i n } \\right)\\right ) \\left[\\bigotimes_{c \\in \\pi_\\text{vertex}^\\text{s } } u_c\\right]^*,\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the set of surviving vertices , @xmath83 is the set of edges connecting surviving vertices and @xmath84 is the set of edges connecting surviving with traced vertices , i.e. crossed edges . since the entropy is unitarily invariant and additive with respect to tensor products , it is immediate that @xmath85    .",

    "we shall look now at the simplest situation for which an approximate area law holds .",
    "we are considering marginals with a unique surviving vertex which may contain traced out subsystems .",
    "we refer to the results in @xcite , section 6.3 , where the exact same situation was studied . in this particular",
    "setting , let us introduce some appropriate notation for the subsystems of the surviving vertex @xmath25 .",
    "the subsystems of @xmath25 are partitioned , on one hand , into surviving @xmath1 subsystems and traced - out subsystems @xmath89 ( note that @xmath89 is a subset of the set of all traced systems in the original graph ) . moreover , the edges of the graph introduce a different partition of @xmath25 , into subsystems attached by loops of @xmath25 ( denoted by @xmath90 ) and subsystems connected to other vertices , which form a set @xmath49 .",
    "hence , three important parameters with respect to the only surviving vertex : @xmath91 , the number of edges connecting this vertex to other traced out vertices , @xmath92 the number of traced out hilbert spaces in this vertex and @xmath93 , the number of surviving hilbert spaces . for the example presented in figure [ fig:1-unitary - marginal - fig ]",

    ", it is not obvious how to give an interpretation of theorem [ thm:1-unitary - marginal ] and of equation in particular , as an area law .",
    "recall that because of the random unitary matrix acting on the vertex @xmath25 , the exact indices of the traced subsystems inside the vertex @xmath25 are irrelevant ( at least in the case of trivial relative dimensions ) .",
    "hence , the topological notion of boundary separating the sets @xmath1 and @xmath31 becomes ambiguous . in the following section",
    ", a more general definition of the boundary of a partition will be given via a combinatorial optimization problem .",
    "before stating and proving the area law in the most general setting , we have to introduce a well - defined notion of boundary surface for a general , possibly non - adapted , partition @xmath40 . in this section",
    ", we shall restrict our attention to the case where all the subsystems have the same dimension @xmath9 .",
    "we shall come back to the general case of arbitrary ratios in section [ sec : different - dimensions ] .",
    "a naive attempt at a definition is to consider the topological notion of boundary that was used in section [ sec : adapted ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : boundary - ill - defined ] , two _ a priori _ different marginals of the same graph state are represented .",
    "given the fact that independent random unitary matrices act on vertices @xmath42 and @xmath69 , one can swap the two hilbert spaces ( say of @xmath42 ) and leave the distribution of the reduced state invariant .",
    "hence , the two states should have the same statistical properties , although they have different boundary areas : note that the boundary line does not cross any edge on the left hand side picture ( null boundary ) , whereas the right hand side picture has a boundary area of 2 ( two intersections ) . hence , it is obvious that such a definition of the boundary area is not suitable .",

    "we shall answer this question in the following three scenarios , each situation imposing some physical restrictions or liberties on the system .",
    "* scenario 1 : no initial entanglement . *",
    "suppose that all the entangled particles shared between pairs of @xmath179 s are lost .",
    "the best we can do is to create locally , at each @xmath179 , maximally entangled ( singlet ) states and to ship one half to @xmath183 and the other half to @xmath184 .",
    "the number of entangled pairs between @xmath183 and @xmath184 will then be @xmath187    * scenario 2 : global operations are allowed . *",
    "suppose that company _ entanglementfactory _ has the ability of performing _ global _ operations on all of its facilities @xmath179 .",
    "then it is easy to produce a maximally entangled state between @xmath183 and @xmath184 : @xmath188    * scenario 3 : entanglement with local operations . * without any assumptions , we show that @xmath189    first , notice that the problem in this case is just as a restatement of the rank theorem discussed earlier , before taking the partial trace of the state .",
    "the facilities @xmath183 and @xmath184 define the partition with respect to which the partial trace is considered .",
    "the entropy of entanglement of the pure state shared between @xmath183 and @xmath184 is just the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix @xmath8 .",
    "note that the following inequality concerning the number of entangled pairs in different scenarios holds @xmath190    one can characterize entanglement by using the generalized rnyi entropy @xmath191 .",
    "note that in the limit the rnyi parameter @xmath192 tends to unity this expression reduces to the von neumann entropy , @xmath193 .",
    "furthermore , the rank @xmath194 of a matrix is given by the generalized entropy of order zero , @xmath195 .",
    "to summarize , the results on the rank and on the rnyi entropy @xmath196 have the following translation    there exist local unitary operations @xmath175 ( which can be taken to be permutation matrices , i.e. at each site @xmath179 we just have to say where each particle goes , to @xmath183 or @xmath184 ) such that @xmath197 for any @xmath198 .",
    "in other words , @xmath199 is essentially a maximally mixed state .",
    "moreover , the permutation matrices involved can be computed efficiently , using a flow algorithm .    in the random case",
    "( suppose the engineers of company _ entanglementfactory _ are on vacation , so the staff decides to implement at each site @xmath179 random , independent local unitary transformations ) , we have the following result , which is a restatement of theorem [ thm : main ] .    for independent random haar unitary matrices @xmath175",
    ", we have , almost surely as @xmath200 , @xmath201 and @xmath202    comparing the two results above , one concludes that the random choice is nearly optimal .",
    "in this final section , we analyze simple graphs in the general setting , where we allow subsystems to have different dimensions .",
    "although we can not state a general area law for marginals of such graph states , we perform direct computations in some simple settings using the full machinery developed in @xcite .",
    "our main tool is the following result , valid for random graph states with subsystems of dimensions @xmath203 .",
    "[ thm : moments - network ] the asymptotic moments of a graph state marginal @xmath8 are given by the formula @xmath204 where @xmath184 is a set of permutations that can be computed from the network @xmath163 associated to the marginal and @xmath205 is the maximal flow @xmath206 in the same network .",
    "for each block @xmath207 of @xmath208 , we write @xmath209 and @xmath210 . finally , @xmath181 is the set of edges going from vertex @xmath20 to vertex @xmath21 .",
    "the above general expression for the average @xmath211-th moment allows us to analyze ensembles of quantum states corresponding to the following exemplary graphs , each containing @xmath212 subsystems , but having different geometry .",
    "we are going to discuss here a simple graph described by two edges joined in one vertex , used to model the trans  horizon entanglement during the process of evaporation of a black hole @xcite . the entire system is thus composed out of four subsystems , two of which have the same dimension equal to @xmath213 , while the other two have the dimensions @xmath214 .",
    "the ratios @xmath215 are treated as parameters of the model .",
    "we shall consider two marginals of this graph state , see figure [ fig : black - hole - graph ] . in both cases ,",
    "the network associated to the marginal is the same , and has a maximum flow @xmath216 .",
    "moreover , the set @xmath184 of permutations achieving this maximum flow is @xmath217     +   +      applying theorem [ thm : moments - network ] to this setting , we obtain @xmath218 in other words @xmath219 thus , the rescaled random matrix @xmath220 converges in moments to the marchenko ",

    "let us now compute the average entropy of this random matrix .",
    "use @xmath222 to show that @xmath223 where @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "note that the formula above is symmetric in @xmath226 and @xmath227 , a consequence of the fact that the non - zero spectra of the two reduced density operators of a pure state are identical .",
    "in this case , the moment formula reads @xmath228 thus , the rescaled random matrix @xmath229 converges in moments to the marchenko ",
    "pastur distribution of parameter @xmath230 .",
    "the entropy computation in this case is easier : @xmath231    note that the two entropy formulas agree in the case @xmath232 .",
    "the graph presented in figure [ fig : oxygen - graph ] , which can be symbolically represented by @xmath234 , might be interpreted as the oxygen molecule .",
    "we will discuss here the general version of the model in which there are two pairs of subsystems of size @xmath213 and @xmath214 respectively , and look at two different marginals .",
    "the two marginals correspond to the same network , which has a maximal flow @xmath216 .",
    "the set @xmath184 of permutations achieving this maximum flow is @xmath235 which is in bijection with the set found for the `` black - hole '' graph .",
    "+   +      proceeding as in the case of the `` black - hole '' graph , we obtain the same result as in the first case above . thus , as before @xmath236 where @xmath224 and @xmath225 .      again , we obtain the same result as in the corresponding case of the `` black - hole '' graph @xmath237    to conclude , note that in general , the relative size of the traced out systems matters ( unless @xmath238 ) . at this point",
    ", we have no interpretation for the surprising fact that the two graphs studied here yield the same output entropies .",
    "in this work , we study the structured model of random pure quantum states introduced in @xcite from the perspective of area laws .",
    "we showed , in the situation where the vertex size is constant , that the entropy of entanglement satisfies , on average , an area law , for a suitable definition of surface area . indeed , since we are dealing with unitary mixing at each vertex , the usual notion of area does not make sense , so one defines surface area via a combinatorial optimization procedure .",
    "in the final section of the paper , we studied some situations where hilbert space dimension varies , in the case of very simple graphs . unfortunately , our current methods ( area defined via combinatorial optimization ) are not adapted anymore , and some further work is necessary to establish an area law in this more general setting .",
    "a mathematical improvement over the current results would be to obtain estimates for the probabilities of failure of the announced area laws .",
    "indeed , our results focus on average quantities and it would be interesting for to derive _ large deviations bounds _ for the entropy of entanglement at fixed ( but large ) hilbert space dimension @xmath9 .    another direction for future work would be to continue the project started in @xcite and to analyze different models of structured entanglement , motivated by solid state physics .",
    "indeed , our starting assumption is that the initial entanglement between vertices is encoded by maximally entangled states .",
    "it would be natural to drop this assumption and to work with _ generic entanglement _",
    ", that could be generated , say , by associating to graph edges an independent set of unitary matrices .",
    "this would render the graph state model more symmetric and make it more realistic .",
