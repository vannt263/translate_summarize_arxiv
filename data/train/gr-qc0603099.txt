    "recent years have seen rapidly growing interest in the issues and problems of radiation reaction on particle motion in a curved spacetime as a result of the need to produce accurate gravitational waveforms for the proposed space - based gravitational interferometer lisa . for generic particle - field interactions the back reaction of emitted radiation on the particle results from two types of interactions with the radiation .",
    "the first is a purely local effect and describes the force on the particle when it emits radiation .",
    "the second is non - local in nature resulting from previously emitted radiation back - scattering off the background spacetime curvature and interacting with the particle at a later time in some other position .",
    "the effects of the emitted radiation appear as a force on the particle , the self - force , that changes the particle s motion from a simple geodesic in the background spacetime .",
    "dewitt and brehme @xcite were the first to study the electromagnetic self - force in a curved spacetime .",
    "the corresponding equation depicting the dynamics of a point mass experiencing self - force from interactions with the ( linear ) metric perturbations it generates off a vacuum background spacetime was first obtained by mino , sasaki and tanaka @xcite and later confirmed by quinn and wald @xcite using axiomatic methods . for an excellent review of these derivations and other issues concerning the motion of particles in a curved spacetime see @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the introduction and development of world line path integral techniques ( see @xcite and references therein ) allows one to derive the equations of motion of ( relativistic ) particles interacting with quantum fields within a self - consistent formalism",
    ". augmented by the paradigm of open quantum systems provides one with a self - consistent means for studying the effects of quantum field fluctuations on the particle s motion .",
    "one can show _ ab initio _ how these fluctuations manifest as classical stochastic forces ( see @xcite for the case of accelerating detectors ( atoms ) and @xcite for moving charges ) .",
    "this approach can be applied to the relation between unruh radiation and ordinary radiation in accelerating detectors ( see @xcite ) .    in a previous paper",
    "@xcite we use the world line influence functional approach to obtain the equations of motion for a scalar charge coupled to a quantum scalar field in a curved spacetime .",
    "our results for the classical motion agree with quinn @xcite .",
    "we also derive a scalar ald - langevin equation and show that the fluctuations in the trajectory depend on their past history ( non - markovian ) , implying that secular effects may be important when stochastic fluctuations are included in a more complete description of the particle s motion .    in this paper",
    ", we use the same approach to study the motions of two kinds of objects .",
    "the first is the dynamics of an electric point charge moving in a quantum electromagnetic field in a curved spacetime .",
    "this generalizes results obtained earlier @xcite from motion in a flat spacetime to a curved one .",
    "the second is the dynamics of a small mass ( point particle ) interacting with quantized linear metric perturbations off a background spacetime ( e.g. a massive black hole ) . in both cases we are interested in the radiation the particle emits and how its back reaction alters the trajectory .",
    "our aim is to derive the equations of motion for the quantum expectation value of the particle s position . if the mechanisms that decohere the particle is strong enough then the expectation value behaves classically . in this limit",
    "we regain the well - known abraham - lorentz - dirac ( ald ) equation in a curved spacetime , which agrees with the earlier derivations of dewitt and brehme @xcite , and the mino - sasaki - tanaka - quinn - wald ( mstqw ) equation , respectively @xcite .",
    "we observe that the self - force acting on the particle is formally infinite as a result of considering point - particle interactions with the field .",
    "this is the usual ultraviolet divergence arising from the assumption of a point particle .",
    "it must be regularized to obtain a finite and unambiguous self - force .",
    "we use a method introduced and developed in @xcite that is inspired by effective field theory , which provides a natural way to quickly identify and renormalize this divergence .",
    "a high energy scale is introduced into the dynamics so that certain criteria on the magnitude of this scale and others must be met in order to have a dynamics consistent with our first principles derivations of ( semi - classical ) equations .",
    "this regularization procedure is not restricted to quantum fields so that one can apply this to the usual problem of relativistic particle and classical field dynamics .",
    "after the derivation of the semi - classical ( noise - averaged ) equations of motion we incorporate the effect of quantum field fluctuations on the motion of the particles by showing how they behave like classical stochastic forces .",
    "we derive an ald - langevin equation for the electric charge motion and a mstqw - langevin equation for the point mass motion .",
    "these equations describe the actual trajectory including stochastic components arising from the quantum field fluctuations when the world line histories are sufficiently decohered .",
    "they are useful for studying the stochastic motion of charges and point masses under the influence of quantum noise sources in curved spacetime .",
    "the same form of the langevin equations derived here with quantum field - induced noise can be used for classical stochastic forces in a phenomenological description of astrophysical sources in stochastic motion .    for such classical stochastic forces",
    "we show that the correlations of the stochastic noise may give rise to a noise - induced drift force that is analogous to the particle drifts encountered in plasma physics . for noise derived from the quantum field fluctuations this effect should contain some information about the quantum statistical state of the particle @xcite .",
    "our study makes it possible to explore in more detail these novel phenomena that may have some observational effects in certain atomic optics experiments .",
    "this drift might also intercede in obtaining more accurate calculations of gravitational waveform templates , although there are likely no significant quantum fluctuation - induced stochastic effects in astrophysical sources .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , after a brief summary of the world line influence functional method we describe how to obtain the semiclassical and stochastic semiclassical particle dynamics for a relativistic particle interacting with a tensor field .",
    "we also describe the philosophy and implementation of the effective field theory inspired approach for regularizing the self - force . in section iii",
    "we apply our results to the specific example of a point charge moving through a quantum vector field in a curved spacetime . in section",
    "iv we study the motion of a point mass moving in a curved background spacetime with quantum linear metric perturbations . in section",
    "v we discuss a phenomenological description of stochastic particle dynamics by adding in noise by hand .",
    "this added noise is shown to generate a noise - induced drift in the particle motion that is analogous to the usual plasma drifts . in section",
    "vi we discuss the various scales appearing in our approximations in order to obtain well - defined solutions that are free from the usual pathologies ( e.g. runaway solutions , pre - acceleration , etc . ) .",

    "it is interesting to observe that when some source of noise acts as a stochastic force on the particle that a noise - induced drifting motion results .",

    "however , at the initial time these coefficients vanish giving the false impression that the usual problems of pre - acceleration and run - away solutions have been resolved .",
    "this time - dependence can be viewed as a consequence of choosing a factorized initial state in our derivations since it takes a time of order @xmath177 for the field modes to fully interact with the particle as they were uncorrelated at the initial time .",
    "to better study the pre - acceleration and run - away solutions we should choose a more physical initial state than the factorizable one used in most treatments .",
    "the mean and stochastic particle dynamics are obtained here by using the gaussian approximation to compute the reduced density matrix , which amounts to working at the tree - level in both the particle and the field sectors .",

    "another relevant scale appears when trying to find unique , physical solutions to the ald equation ( [ em_reg_cl_ald ] ) , which contains a term with a third derivative of the particle s position . as is well known , this term is responsible for the problematic existence of pre - accelerated , acausal and runaway solutions .",
    "these kinds of solutions can be eliminated if the self - force is weak compared to other forces acting on the particle . in particular , an asymptotic expansion in powers of @xmath318 , called the landau approximation or order - reduction @xcite , is employed to obtain physical solutions that require only an initial position and velocity .",

    "<S> we provide a quantum field theoretical derivation of the abraham - lorentz - dirac ( ald ) equation , describing the motion of an electric point charge sourcing an electromagnetic field , which back - reacts on the charge as a self - force , and the mino - sasaki - tanaka - quinn - wald ( mstqw ) equation describing the motion of a point mass with self - force interacting with the linearized metric perturbations caused by the mass off an otherwise vacuous curved background spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> we regularize the formally divergent self - force by smearing the direct part of the retarded green s function and using a quasilocal expansion . </S>",
    "<S> we also derive the ald - langevin and the mstqw - langevin equations with a classical stochastic force accounting for the effect of the quantum fluctuations in the field , which causes small fluctuations on the particle trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> these equations will be useful for studying the stochastic motion of charges and small masses under the influence of both quantum and classical noise sources , derived either self - consistently or put in by hand phenomenologically . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that history - dependent noise - induced drift motions could arise from such stochastic sources on the trajectory that could be a hidden feature of gravitational wave forms hitherto unknown . </S>"
