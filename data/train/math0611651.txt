    "the interest in an enumerative approach to lattice walks under various different types of restrictions has risen recently , ( see @xcite ) and there is increased need for global approaches and results .",
    "a few such studies have been performed .",
    "for example , in the case of the one dimensional lattice walks , flajolet and banderier  @xcite examine the nature of their generating functions , and provide general results of asymptotic analysis .",
    "for two dimensional walks in the quarter plane , we find a collection of case analyses   @xcite , and the goal here is to try to determine more general characterizations of these walks , based on the nature of their generating functions .",
    "essentially we are interested to know which walks have holonomic generating functions , that is , when does the generating function satisfy systems of independent linear differential equations with polynomial coefficients .",
    "the answer has important repercussions for sequence generation , asymptotics , amongst other enumerative questions .",
    "unfortunately we do not completely succeed in giving a characterization of all walks , but we do uncover some interesting patterns , and present variety of applications of the kernel method .",
    "we derive enumerative information to support a new conjecture on the combinatorial conditions required for a class of walks to possess holonomic ( or , d - finte ) generating functions .",
    "the walks of interest here are known as _ next nearest neighbour walks_. precisely , they use movements on the integer lattice where each step is from some fixed set @xmath0 , which we also specify by the compass directions  @xmath1 . such a set @xmath2 is called a _ step set_. here we shall consider nearest neighbour walks exclusively , unless explicitly mentioned otherwise .",
    "a _ walk in the quarter plane _ is a sequence of steps  @xmath3 in @xmath4 , @xmath5 , such that for each @xmath6 , the vector sum @xmath7 satisfies @xmath8 , that is , it remains in the first quadrant .",
    "we shall denote the set of all valid walks with steps from  @xmath2 by  @xmath9 .",
    "we can consider this as a formal language ( in the sense of theoretical computer science ) over the alphabet @xmath2 with the horizontal and vertical conditions as prefix conditions on any word in the language .",
    "fix some step set  @xmath2 .",
    "we associate to  @xmath9 two power series :  @xmath10 a counting ( ordinary , univariate ) generating function and a complete ( multivariate ) generating function .",
    "the series  @xmath10 , is a formal power series where the coefficient of @xmath11 is the number of walks of length  @xmath12 .",
    "the complete generating function @xmath13 encodes more information .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath14 in  @xmath13 is the number of walks of length @xmath12 ending at the point  @xmath15 .",
    "remark that the specialization @xmath16 in the complete generating function is precisely @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath17 . in both cases , when @xmath2 is clear it is often dropped as an index .    in part",
    ", our interest in the complete generating function stems from the fact that if it is in a particular functional class , then generally so is @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , we can determine a useful functional equation that it satisfies .",
    "the _ fundamental equation _",
    "satisfied by a complete generating function is determined from the recursive definition that a walk of length  @xmath12 is a walk of length @xmath19 plus a step . for a walk ending on the @xmath20- or @xmath21-axis , it is possible that not all of the directions from @xmath2 will be permissible for the next step , and",
    "thus we subtract out these sub - series .",

    "let @xmath27 . a multivariate generating function  @xmath28 is _ algebraic _ if there exists a multivariate polynomial @xmath29 such that @xmath30 .",
    "flajolet  @xcite summarizes a number of criteria which imply the transcendence of a series .",
    "one which we shall use here is a consequence of his theorem d : if the taylor coefficient of @xmath31 of a function @xmath32 ( analytic at the origin ) is asymptotically equivalent to @xmath33 , and further if @xmath34 is irrational or a negative integer ; or if @xmath35 is transcendental ; or if @xmath36 transcendental , then @xmath32 is transcendental .",
    "a multivariate series @xmath28 is _ holonomic _ if the vector space generated by its partial derivatives ( and their iterates ) , over rational functions of @xmath37 is finite dimensional .",
    "this is equivalent to the existence of @xmath12 partial differential equations of the form @xmath38 for @xmath39 satisfying @xmath40 , and where the @xmath41 are all polynomials in @xmath37 .",
    "holonomic functions are also known as _",
    "d - finite _ functions .    algebraic functions are always holonomic , but as @xmath42 is holonomic and transcendental , we see this containment is strict .",
    "the closure properties of these two classes are presented by stanley  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch . 6 ) .",
    "in particular , here we shall use the fact that if @xmath43 is holonomic with respect to the @xmath44 , and if the algebraic substitution @xmath45 makes sense as a power series substitution , then @xmath46 is holonomic with respect to the @xmath47 variables .",
    "the goal of this work is to determine when @xmath18 and @xmath48 are holonomic , algebraic , or neither .",
    "the next two theorems are a model example of the kind of result we aspire to emulate , from the classification point of view .",
    "[ thm : hpc ] let  @xmath2 be a subset of @xmath49 .",
    "the complete generating series  @xmath50 for walks that start at @xmath51 , take their steps in  @xmath2 and stay in a half plane is algebraic .",
    "a step set @xmath2 is _",
    "@xmath21-axis symmetric _",

    "@xmath54 ) .",
    "[ thm : sym ] let @xmath2 be a finite subset of @xmath55 that is symmetric with respect to the @xmath21-axis .",
    "then the complete generating function  @xmath56 for walks that start from @xmath51 , take their steps in @xmath2 , and stay in the first quadrant is holonomic .",
    "for example , @xmath57 satisfies the conditions of theorem  [ thm : sym ] , and thus @xmath58 is a holonomic function . naturally , an analogous result for step sets from @xmath59 which are @xmath20-axis symmetric is also true .",
    "here we introduce two combinatorial operations which act on the step sets and which play an important role .",
    "first , we have @xmath60 , which switches the coordinates , @xmath61 , effectively flipping each step across the line  @xmath62 . this operator preserves both algebraicity and holonomy , since it amounts to a simple variable switch in the complete generating function .",
    "a second useful operator is @xmath63 , which switches the direction of a step , @xmath64 .",
    "for example , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "the reverse of a set @xmath2 , @xmath67 , is the set resulting when @xmath63 is applied to each element of @xmath2 .",
    "the reverse of a walk @xmath68 , is the application of @xmath63 to each step : @xmath69 .",
    "this action can also be viewed as a reflection in the line @xmath70 .",
    "the reverse of a step set may result in a step set which has only the trivial walk in the quarter plane .",
    "aside from these , the effect of this operation on the generating function can be determined , but as it is much less direct than in the @xmath60 case , it is not entirely clear if it preserves either holonomy or algebraicity .",
    "evidence would seem to indicate that in the case when the walk is non - trivial , that it does preserve both properties . in section  [ sec : future ] we will give a better intuition as to why this could be the case .      in order to classify all of the walks with step sets of cardinality three",
    ", it is not necessary to consider all  @xmath71 possibilities .",
    "any step set which is a subset of @xmath72 has no valid walk in the quarter plane .",
    "these are 10 in total . reflecting a step set in the line @xmath62 yields a class of walks in bijection .",
    "there are only four step sets which are invariant under this action , leaving 21 pairs of duplicates with respect to this action , and thus , there are 25 classes of walks , up to symmetry in the line @xmath62",
    ". we can reduce this even further by determining other bijective classes .",
    "we shall soon show that there are 11 non - bijective classes of walks over all , and all of their generating functions can be classified .",
    "as we remarked in the introduction , each step set is governed by at most two inequalities . in many cases",
    "one of the inequalities implies the other , or one is trivial .",
    "for example , the set @xmath73 only satisfies trivial inequalities , and the vertical constraint on the walks  @xmath74 is implied by the horizontal .",
    "these are both examples of _ singular _ step sets .",
    "a step set is _ singular _ if it is a subset of any of the following sets :    1 .",
    "@xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "these sets are pictured in vector format figure  [ fig : singular ] .",
    "[ thm : sing ] if @xmath2 is a singular step set , then the complete generating function @xmath13 is an algebraic function .",
    "the algebraicity of the counting generating function for walks with a singular step set can be deduced from the observation that the quarter plane condition of singular walks is equivalent to the half plane condition , and these walks are algebraic by theorem  [ thm : hpc ] .",
    "furthermore , it is simple to construct a simple pushdown automaton which recognizes the language of the walk .",
    "the language is thus unambiguously context - free and it follows that the counting generating function is algebraic  @xcite , and are easy to determine .    in order to prove the algebraicity of the complete generating function",
    ", we give an explicit , unambiguous grammar satisfied by the walks . a well - chosen weighting on the certain variables",
    "gives a system of algebraic equations satisfied by the complete generating function , and thus proves the algebraicity .",
    "if the walk is singular , then there is one governing inequality . without loss of generality",
    "suppose it is the horizontal condition .",
    "divide the directions of the step set into three subsets : let @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "thus , the vertical condition is given by @xmath84 .",
    "if @xmath2 is singular , then  @xmath9 is generated by  @xmath85 in the following grammar , which assures that the number of @xmath86s is always greater than the number of @xmath87s for any prefix .",
    "the class @xmath85 is decomposed by the last step up at a certain height .",
    "@xmath88 there is a direct correspondence between these grammars and the functional equations satisfied by the generating function  @xcite .",
    "each step is weighted by a monomial corresponding to its direction , namely @xmath15 is assigned to @xmath89 .",
    "this gives a solvable algebraic system for the complete generating system : @xmath90    we can then solve for  @xmath91 .    to illustrate the process from the proof of proposition  [ thm : sing ] , we determine algebraic equations satisfied by the generating system for walks given by @xmath92 . here , the horizontal constraint implies the vertical , and we set @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 .",
    "the walks are generated by @xmath96 in the following grammar : @xmath97 in this case , the algebraic system is determined from the three substitutions @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 into the above system .",
    "the solution  @xmath101 of this system gives an expression for  @xmath50 : @xmath102    in total there are 18 singular step sets .",
    "however , the walks which are true two dimensional walks are governed by one of the following four inequality types , and they are all isomorphic to one of four different classes ( numbers refer to table  [ tab : classes ] ) : @xmath103    .generating function data for walks whose step set is of cardinality three [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath104 be the power series in @xmath105 defined by @xmath106 + @xmath107 + @xmath108 + @xmath109 +      the remaining non - singular walks , ( seven in total ) break down as follows .",

    "however , if @xmath260 , we can show that asymptotically , as @xmath12 tends to infinity @xmath261 tends to @xmath262 .",
    "thus by criterion  d of @xcite , the series @xmath259 is transcendental .",
    "thus , we have established a contradiction , and @xmath256 is not algebraic .",
    "recall , however , that it is holonomic , by theorem  [ thm : sym ] .",
    "knowing that walks in the half plane and slit planes are algebraic , and considering that walks in the quarter plane are ultimately relatively simple objects they are governed by only two inequalities , it may be surprising that there are classes with generating functions which are not holonomic .",
    "however , it is already known that bousquet - mlou and petkovec s knight s walks  @xcite ( @xmath263 ) are not holonomic , and , in fact , evidence would seem to indicate that many walks in the quarter plane are not holonomic .",
    "the final two walks we consider have non - holonomic complete generating functions .",
    "this non - holonomy is established in  @xcite , and is based on a similar problem of self - avoiding walks in wedges  @xcite .",
    "the general argument is to show that there are an infinite number of singularities in the counting generating function .",
    "this is similar to the argument of bousquet - mlou and petkovec , whose proof also use an adaptation of a kernel method argument .",
    "however , for these walks , it seems that there is a more direct application of the group of the walk .",
    "specifically , we use the fact that the group of the walk is infinite to demonstrate the infinite set of singularities .    from  @xcite we pull the following two results which completes our classification . in the next section we present a small summary of the argument .",
    "[ thm : notdfin ] neither the complete generating function  @xmath264 , nor the counting generating function @xmath265 of nearest - neighbour walks in the first quadrant with steps from @xmath266 are holonomic functions with respect to their variable sets .",
    "[ thm : q11 ] neither the complete generating function  @xmath267 , nor the counting generating function @xmath268 of nearest - neighbour walks in the first quadrant with steps from @xmath269 are holonomic functions with respect to their variable sets .",
    "to begin , we recall the fundamental equation of these walks , @xmath271 and its kernel form , @xmath272 here , for brevity we did write @xmath50 as @xmath273 , and have used the @xmath274 symmetry to rewrite @xmath275 as @xmath276 .",
    "there are two solutions for the kernel  @xmath277 as a function of @xmath21 @xmath278 since we can show that @xmath279 if we write @xmath280 , and likewise for @xmath281 , we have that the set @xmath282 forms an infinite group , under the operation @xmath283 , with identity  @xmath284",
    ". we can also show the useful relation , @xmath285 and its iterated equivalent , @xmath286    by construction we have @xmath287 , thus substituting @xmath288 into eq .   gives ( after a little tidying )",
    "@xmath289 now we substitute  @xmath290 into this equation to obtain @xmath291 using this expression for @xmath292 for various @xmath12 , we can iteratively generate a new expression for @xmath293 : @xmath294 since @xmath295 we have that @xmath296 as a formal power series in @xmath105 and consequently @xmath297 we now specialize the fundamental equation : @xmath298    the result follows from the following lemma , which is proved in  @xcite    [ thm : work ] suppose @xmath299 is a zero of @xmath300 , and that @xmath301",
    ". then    1 .   for all @xmath302 , @xmath303 ; and 2 .",
    "the function @xmath304 has a pole at the @xmath305 .",
    "we now have all the components in place to prove the main result .",
    "the function @xmath306 has a set of poles given by the zeroes of the @xmath307 , by the preceding lemma .",
    "the set of such poles form an infinite set .",
    "thus , @xmath308 is not holonomic . for a multivariate series to be holonomic ,",
    "any of its algebraic specializations must be holonomic , and as @xmath308 is an algebraic specialization of both @xmath50 and @xmath309 , neither of these two functions are holonomic either .",
    "a natural extension of this work would be to complete the story , and use the functional equations to find enumerative data .",
    "this is a natural question , and it speaks to robustness of the method .",
    "we can in general follow the steps to express the counting generating function as a sum of products of @xmath310 . however , when the group of the walk is finite , the @xmath310 form a finite group , and thus this sum does not converge as power series .",
    "the difficulty in using this method arises in showing that the singularities do not cancel .",
    "the group of the walk is useful for determining additional equations in the the kernel method .",
    "however , an examination of all nearest neighbour walks and their groups reveals a surprising fact about when this group is finite .",
    "table  [ tab : fingroup ] lists all nearest neighbour walks with finite groups ( up to symmetry in the line @xmath62 )                    this conjecture also implies that @xmath63 preserves holonomy . if @xmath112 is the kernel related to @xmath2 , then @xmath315 is the kernel related to @xmath67 . by taking the viewpoint that @xmath316 and @xmath317 are mere variables",
    ", we see that if the -step set group is finite , then so is the @xmath67-step set as the groups will be the same .",
    "we note that step set # 10 , whose generating function is not holonomic , does have some symmetry @xmath318 , but this is not sufficient to offer holonomy .",
    "it is worth noting that the other two classes with this same symmetry are kreweras and reverse kreweras .",
    "we would like to characterize the classification combinatorially .",
    "several natural generalizations are possible , such as what is a meaningful definition for group in 3 dimensions ? does an analogous definition still yield dihedral groups ?",
    "what about step sets which are not of the nearest neighbour type ; what kinds of groups come out of that ? we are also currently investigating a similar classification for different wedge shapes , such as 1/8-plane and 3/4-plane .",
    "fayolle et al .",
    "give a characterization for when the group is finite .",
    "can this be translated into straightforward combinatorial terms ?",
