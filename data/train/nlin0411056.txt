    "dark solitons have been predicted theoretically and observed experimentally in different types of dispersive or diffractive nonlinear media , including optical and magnetic systems  @xcite .",

    "indeed , the first observation of _ dark solitons _ in yig magnetic films  @xcite revealed unusual features of the dark - soliton generation observed as a change of the total number of generated spin - wave dark solitons from even to odd with the growth of the input power .",
