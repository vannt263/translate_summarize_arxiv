    "a dual meissner effect arising as a consequence of the condensation of these magnetic charges might give rise to the formation of flux tubes which confine quarks .",
    "+   + the possibility of achieving a description of the low energy regime of yang - mills theories in terms of an effective abelian theory , also referred to as the abelian dominance hypothesis @xcite , is being investigated since several years , from both theoretical and lattice simulations points of view , see also @xcite ) for more recent investigations . in the maximal abelian gauge ,",
    "the abelian degrees of freedom are identified with the diagonal components of the gauge field corresponding to the diagonal generators of the gauge group .",
    "the remaining off - diagonal components decouple at low energies due to a dynamical generation of an off - diagonal mass , a feature which has already received analytical @xcite and numerical evidence @xcite .",
    "+   + in this work we pursue the investigation of the nonperturbative aspects of yang - mills theories in the maximal abelian gauge by addressing the issue of the glueball spectrum and of its comparison with the results already obtained in the case of the landau gauge @xcite .",
    "this goal will be achieved by combining several ingredients .",
    "firstly , we shall generalize to the case of the maximal abelian gauge the so called replica model , already introduced in the landau gauge @xcite . as we shall see",
    ", the replica model exhibits two nice features which are particularly useful in order to analyse the spectrum of the lightest glueballs .",
    "the first property concerns the gluon and ghost propagators , which turn out to be of the same kind of those already introduced in @xcite and which are in agreement with the available lattice data @xcite .",
    "moreover , unlike the model introduced in @xcite , the replica model enables us to make use of genuine local gauge invariant composite operators whose correlation functions can be employed to study the glueball spectrum . in addition , and in complete analogy with the case of the landau gauge , the replica model of the maximal abelian gauge will be proven to be renormalizable to all orders . as such , the model displays useful nonperturbative features .",
    "secondly , we shall establish a suitable mass formula for the glueballs by relying on a kind of inspired svz sum rules , already employed in the case of the landau gauge @xcite .",
    "the combination of these two ingredients will enable us to provide a qualitative analysis of the location of the masses of the lightest glueball states .",
    "+   + having thus at our disposal a model which gives rise to diagonal and off diagonal gluon propagators in agreement with those observed in lattice simulations , we employ it in order to study the correlation functions of the local composite gauge invariant operators with the quantum numbers of the three lightest glueballs , namely @xmath4 . in particular , thanks to the analytic structure of the diagonal gluon propagator , the correlation functions of the composite operators corresponding to the states @xmath4 , can be cast in the form of a klln - lehmann spectral representation with positive spectral densities , enabling us to provide a qualitative study of the mass spectrum of the lightest glueball states in the maximal abelian gauge .",
    "it turns out that , under the assumption of the abelian dominance @xcite , the resulting glueball spectrum is in agreement with that already obtained in the case of the landau gauge @xcite .",
    "this result can be taken as evidence of the nonperturbative gauge independence of the physical spectrum of the theory .",
    "+   + the paper is organized as follows . in sect.2",
    "we give a brief account of the available lattice numerical simulations on the gluon propagator in the maximal abelian gauge .",

    "sect.5 is devoted to present our results about the mass spectrum of the states @xmath4 .",
    "in sect.6 we collect our conclusion .",
    "all technical details about the proof of the renormalizability of the replica model in the maximal abelian gauge can be found in the appendix a , while in the appendix b the plots of the mass hierarchy of the states @xmath4 are displayed .",
    "before giving a short account of the lattice investigations , let us remind that , in the @xmath0 maximal abelian gauge , the gauge field @xmath5 is decomposed into diagonal and off - diagonal components , according to @xmath6 where @xmath7 stand for the pauli matrices .",

    "it is worth underlining that the nonvanishing of the gluon propagator at zero momentum in the landau gauge has been also seen in lattice simulations , see for example @xcite .",
    "as we shall see in the following , this is a very welcome feature which will play an important role in the discussion of the glueball spectrum in the maximal abelian gauge .",

    "although , as expected from the hypothesis of abelian dominance , the value of the off - diagonal parameter @xmath25 is greater than @xmath26 , a clear evidence for the abelian dominance would demand a more complete analysis , perhaps using larger lattices .",
