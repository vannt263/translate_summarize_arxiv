    "for quite some time , kaons have attracted the attention of nuclear physicists .",
    "the reason is that strangeness , a quantum number conserved in strong interactions , attributes a special role to the kaons among the possible projectiles for investigating nuclear structure .",
    "kaons have two properties which make them unique tools .",
    "firstly , they can transfer a new degree of freedom to the nucleus , and secondly , in contrast to pions they come in two forms , kaons ( @xmath10 ) and antikaons ( @xmath11 ) which differ substantially in their interaction with the nucleus .",
    "kaons with their quark content @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) have strangeness s=1 ; however , nuclear states involving strangeness can only contain hyperons ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) which have the same strangeness ( s=1 ) as antikaons ( quark content @xmath16 or @xmath17 ) .",
    "therefore , the interaction between kaons and nuclei is rather weak , which is demonstrated , _",
    "e.g. _ , by the large @xmath18 nuclear mean free path of about 57 fm for @xmath19 . consequently , the @xmath18 meson is a suitable probe for investigating the interior region of nuclei . on the other hand",
    ", antikaons have s=1 and their absorption in nuclei can easily produce hypernuclei containing @xmath4 or @xmath5hyperons .",
    "since such processes occur with sizeable reaction probability the region of investigation is probably restricted to the nuclear surface .",
    "the successful use of kaons in nuclear structure requires the precise knowledge of the interaction mechanism of kaons with nuclei .",
    "each uncertainty in the theoretical description necessarily leads to uncertainties in the interpretation of empirical results . since each theoretical model for the kaon ",
    "nucleus interaction starts from the free kaon ",
    "nucleon interaction and then adds medium modifications in one way or another , a precise knowledge of the free interaction is absolutely essential .",
    "recently @xcite we have presented a meson exchange model for the @xmath9 interaction , which provides a reasonable description of the empirical @xmath9 scattering data for laboratory momenta smaller than 0.8 gev / c . for model b of ref .",
    "@xcite the diagrams included are shown in figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) ; they have been evaluated in time ",
    "ordered perturbation theory . by @xmath20",
    "we denote a very short ranged , phenomenological , repulsive contribution , which has the analytical form of scalar @xmath21exchange with opposite sign and with an exchanged mass of 1.2 gev .",
    "this additional repulsion is required if the @xmath22coupling constants @xmath23 , @xmath24 are restricted to their su(6 ) value .",
    "an important ingredient is the contribution arising from @xmath21 and @xmath8exchange : @xmath21exchange provides the dominant part of the intermediate range attraction and @xmath8exchange determines , to a large part , the isospin dependence of the interaction . despite their importance",
    ", however , these pieces have been treated so far in a very rough way . in both cases",
    "a sharp mass has been used which means their appreciable decay widths have not been taken into account .",
    "the @xmath21 meson is a fictitious particle not observed in nature so both its mass and coupling constant are therefore free parameters . in the case of the @xmath8 meson",
    "the coupling strength is obtained as a product of a coupling constant at the @xmath25 vertex , which is taken from the bonn potential @xcite and the coupling constant at the @xmath26 vertex , which is calculated via su(3 ) relations from the ( empirically known ) @xmath27 coupling constant . whether this procedure provides",
    "a reliable result is doubtful since i ) the @xmath8meson coupling constants used in the bonn potential are questionable @xcite and ii ) su(3 ) relations are not necessarily valid for unstable particles",
    ".    in this simple model , @xmath21 and @xmath8exchange essentially stand for the correlated @xmath28exchange contribution in the @xmath29 ( @xmath21 ) and @xmath30 ( @xmath8 ) channel , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to derive this contribution starting from a microscopic model for the t ",
    "channel reaction @xmath31 with @xmath32 ( and @xmath33 ) intermediate states and using a dispersion relation over the unitarity cut .",
    "this realistic model of ( effective ) @xmath21 and @xmath8exchange is then used to reconstruct an extended meson exchange model for @xmath34 scattering .",
    "such a microscopic description of correlated @xmath28exchange is essential not only for an adequate judgment of the quantitative role of meson exchange in free @xmath35 scattering , but also for the calculation of kaon  nucleus scattering processes .",
    "effects of medium modifications of meson masses @xcite inevitably require an explicit , realistic model for correlated @xmath28exchange .",
    "in sect.2 we outline the basic formalism .",
    "sect.3 contains the essential features of our model for the @xmath31 transition .",
    "in sect.4 we present the results for the correlated @xmath0 contribution in @xmath34 scattering , in terms of suitably defined effective coupling constants .",
    "furthermore , we compare @xmath34 phase shifts and observables derived from the extended model with those obtained before .",
    "sect.5 contains some concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we outline the formalism which we use in order to derive the correlated @xmath0exchange contribution for the @xmath34 interaction .",
    "the procedure is similar to that which was used in @xmath36 scattering @xcite .",
    "the scattering amplitude @xmath39 is related to the @xmath40 matrix by @xmath41 where @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) is the total four  momentum in the initial ( final ) state , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 with @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) the nucleon ( kaon ) mass .    in the s  channel ( @xmath48 ) @xmath39 can be written as @xmath49 here , the dirac spinor @xmath50 with the normalization @xmath51 describes a nucleon with helicity @xmath52 and three ",
    "momentum @xmath53 , while @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) is the isospin wave function of a nucleon ( kaon ) .",
    "the operator @xmath56 acts in spin and isospin space and depends on the two independent mandelstam variables @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the third variable @xmath59 is related to @xmath60 and @xmath61 by @xmath62 .",
    "the scattering operator @xmath63 has the following isospin structure : @xmath64 where @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) is the isospin operator for the nucleon ( kaon ) and @xmath67 \\ , , \\label { t - chan}\\ ] ] with @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 being the four  dimensional unit matrix .",
    "the corresponding t  channel ( @xmath2 ) amplitude is given by @xmath71 with @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) the dirac spinor ( isospin state ) of an antinucleon .",
    "the mandelstam hypothesis states now that @xmath63 ( and therefore @xmath76 , @xmath77 in eq.([t - chan ] ) ) is the same function of s and t as in eq.([s - chan ] ) , but in a different kinematical domain , _",
    "i.e. _ for @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .      in order to isolate the @xmath21 and @xmath8 contribution we have to perform a partial wave decomposition of the amplitudes in the t  channel : @xmath81 ( the same for @xmath77 ) .",
    "the @xmath82 are the legendre functions and @xmath83 .",
    "the scattering angle in the t ",
    "channel , @xmath84 , can be expressed in terms of s and t : @xmath85 conservation of parity and g  parity demands that the sum of spin and isospin must be even in case of a @xmath0 intermediate state .",
    "therefore @xmath86 , @xmath87 ( @xmath88 , @xmath89 ) will vanish for even ( odd ) @xmath90 if we only consider @xmath0 intermediate states",
    ". this argument does not hold for an intermediate @xmath1 state ; there @xmath88 , @xmath89 ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 ) are also possible for odd ( even ) @xmath90 .",
    "however in our model these amplitudes turn out to be negligibly small and can be safely neglected .",
    "then the isospin index @xmath91 can be suppressed since @xmath90 determines uniquely the isospin state .",
    "since the @xmath92 and @xmath93 amplitudes contain kinematical singularities , one has to define new amplitudes @xmath94 , which are free of these singularities @xcite . here the index @xmath95 denotes the helicity of the @xmath96 state : @xmath97 , @xmath98 .",
    "( @xmath99 . ) in terms of these amplitudes @xmath92 and @xmath93 can be written as @xmath100 with @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) in the c.m .",
    "system of the t  channel process .",
    "the @xmath21 ( @xmath8 ) exchange contribution , defined as the correlated @xmath0exchange in the scalar ( vector ) t  channel , is identified as the @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) term of eq.([ab - amp ] ) .",
    "one now can perform the analytic continuation of the @xmath106 amplitudes to physical t  values in the s  channel ( @xmath107 ) , which requires knowledge of the cut structure in the complex _",
    "t _ plane .",
    "the right hand ( unitarity ) cut runs from @xmath108 to @xmath109 , whereas the left hand cut , determined by @xmath4 exchange runs from @xmath110 to @xmath111 .",
    "this means that the cuts overlap . in this overlap region",
    "the baryon exchange born term of the reaction @xmath2 has an imaginary part . as we are only interested in the correlated @xmath0 contribution ( which we call @xmath112 in the following ) we perform the dispersion relation for @xmath94 only over the right hand cut , leaving out the born term .",
    "then we get for @xmath21exchange the following contributions to the invariant amplitudes in the s  channel : @xmath113 ( for convergence reasons , see ref .",
    "@xcite , the dispersion relation has to be performed for @xmath114 , @xmath115 . )",
    "similarly we obtain for @xmath8exchange @xmath116 here s and t have to assume physical values of the s  channel , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath117 and @xmath107 .",
    "these amplitudes can be interpreted as meson exchange potentials for which the meson mass @xmath118 is distributed over the range from @xmath119 to @xmath109 .",
    "the corresponding coupling constants depend on the mass ; they are proportional to the spectral functions @xmath120 , @xmath121 .",
    "therefore , these spectral functions determine the dynamical behaviour of the exchanges , _",
    "i.e. _ , they characterize the strength as well as the range of these potentials .    concerning @xmath8exchange , it was pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite that there is a considerable uncertainty in the results .",
    "the reason is that eq.([ab - rhof ] ) disperses the helicity amplitudes directly ; alternatively , one ( @xcite ) can first construct combinations @xmath122 corresponding to vector ( @xmath123 ) and tensor ( @xmath124 ) coupling amplitudes , where @xmath125 and then perform the dispersion integral , which yields @xmath126 both methods would be equivalent if the dispersion integrals could be performed over both the complete left hand and unitarity cut .",
    "however , @xmath8exchange is customarily defined via a dispersion integral over the unitarity cut only .",
    "indeed , the additional t  dependence in @xmath127 apart from the t  dependence provided by the helicity amplitudes @xmath112 causes the results to be quite different , as will be discussed later .      based on eqs .",
    "( [ s - chan ] )  ( [ t - chan ] ) the correlated @xmath0exchange contributions to the @xmath34 scattering amplitude can then be written as @xmath128    u(\\vec p , \\lambda ) \\ } \\vec \\tau_n \\cdot \\vec \\tau_k \\ ; , \\label { t - sigrho}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] omitting isospin states for convenience . in the c.m .",
    "system of the @xmath48 reaction @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 . since we will treat @xmath132 later as potentials to be iterated in the scattering equation belonging to time ",
    "ordered perturbation theory , we apply an off - shell extrapolation of the dispersion relations in the following way : we first replace the denominator @xmath133 in analogy to the time  ordered propagator @xmath134 ( @xmath135^{\\frac { 1}{2}}$ ] , @xmath136 is the total c.m .",
    "energy ) , which is motivated by the fact that the dispersion integral sums over exchanges of particles with mass @xmath137 . for the additional t dependence in eqs.([ab - rhof],[ab - rhog",
    "] ) we keep @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "note that this does not change the on  shell result .",
    "in addition we have to add phenomenological cutoffs in order to generate sufficient convergence in the scattering equation .",
    "again we interpret the correlated @xmath0 potentials as generated by exchange of particles with mass @xmath118 and define a formfactor @xmath140 which is squared under the dispersion integral .",
    "this is analogous to the monopole type form factor we use at each vertex of the ordinary meson and baryon exchange potentials .",
    "we use @xmath141 mev for the model where we perform the dispersion integral for @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "one should realize that this procedure modifies the original on  shell result somewhat .",
    "however , it lies in the range of uncertainties which are inherent in the whole procedure , which are discussed further in sect.4 .    with the above extensions the amplitudes in eq.([t - sigrho ] ) have a well defined off ",
    "shell behaviour with a sufficient fall  off for high momenta .",
    "corresponding potential matrix elements , @xmath144 , acquire an additional factor @xmath145 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath146 .",
    "unitarization then leads to the scattering amplitude , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath147 where @xmath148 contains contributions from the diagrams shown in fig .  1 , except that now the @xmath21 and @xmath8 exchange potentials are replaced by the correlated @xmath28 exchange potentials discussed here",
    "in the last section we have outlined a method of obtaining the correlated @xmath0exchange contribution to the @xmath48 scattering amplitude from the @xmath2 partial wave helicity amplitudes @xmath94 . since , unlike for the @xmath149 case ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we can not rely on quasiempirical information , we have to provide a field  theoretic model for the @xmath2 amplitudes .",
    "anyhow , such a dynamical model has definite advantages when medium modifications of the @xmath34 interaction are considered since it facilitates future investigation of not only possible medium effects due to changes in the kaon and nucleon propagators , but also in the @xmath2 interaction itself .",
    "we will generate the amplitude for the process of fig .",
    "1(c ) in the t  channel by solving the scattering equation in the blankenbecler  sugar ( bbs ) @xcite reduction scheme : @xmath150 where @xmath151 here @xmath152 is the transition interaction from @xmath96 to @xmath153 , @xmath154 are transition amplitudes from @xmath155 and @xmath1 to @xmath1 , and @xmath156 is the free two  particle green s function for the _ aa _ intermediate state .",
    "the ingredients of the dynamical model for the transition interactions @xmath157 and @xmath158 are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the potential @xmath159 ( @xmath158 ) consists of @xmath160 and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) exchange terms plus @xmath8 meson pole diagrams . @xmath161 and @xmath162 are obtained from the driving terms shown in fig .",
    "such a model involving the coupled channels @xmath155 and @xmath1 was constructed by our group @xcite based on time ",
    "ordered perturbation theory . here ,",
    "as in a recent study of @xmath36 scattering @xcite , we use a model with essentially the same physical input , which alternatively uses the bbs scheme .",
    "the description of the data turns out to be as successful as in ref .",
    "for more details , the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "we stress that all parameters are predetermined : @xmath161 and @xmath162 , through the coupled channel calculation , are fixed by @xmath155 while both transition potentials are determined by the quasiempirical @xmath149 information , cf .",
    "@xcite .    in the c.m . system and in helicity representation eq.([tchant ] ) after a partial wave expansion becomes @xmath163 with @xmath164 the @xmath2 on  shell amplitudes are related to the helicity amplitudes @xmath94 via @xmath165 with @xmath166    fig .",
    "4 shows the results for @xmath167 and @xmath168 in the pseudophysical region ( @xmath169 ) , needed as input for eqs.([ab - sigma ] , [ ab - rhof ] , [ ab - rhog ] ) .",
    "as expected , the spectral function in the @xmath8channel shows a resonant structure with a maximum at about the @xmath8mass . in the @xmath21channel",
    "the spectral function is much broader than for the @xmath8 ; compared to the @xmath170 case ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) it is weaker and the peak is shifted somewhat to a higher mass ( see also the discussion later ) .",
    "furthermore , the inclusion of intermediate @xmath1 states leads to a sizable enhancement of @xmath167 whereas its effect is negligible in the @xmath8channel .",
    "this is due to the fact that the @xmath1 interaction is weak in the vector but strong in the scalar channel .",
    "in fact , as discussed in refs.@xcite and @xcite , the @xmath171 interaction generates a @xmath171 bound state , the @xmath172 meson .",
    "this state clearly has a strong effect on the shape of @xmath167 .",
    "based on the spectral functions of the last section we can now evaluate , in a first step , the ( on  shell ) invariant amplitudes with the help of eqs.([ab - sigma ] , [ ab - rhof ] , [ ab - rhog ] ) . in practice , the integrals have been evaluated up to @xmath173 , _",
    "i.e. _ , in a region in which the dynamical model can be trusted .",
    "it is instructive to parametrize the result by sharp mass @xmath21 and @xmath8exchange with appropriate t ",
    "dependent coupling constants which can be compared with those used in our former model .",
    "let us start with the @xmath21channel . from the lagrangians used in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath174 we get for the invariant amplitude arising from @xmath21exchange : @xmath175 with @xmath176 .",
    "if we now parametrize the result of our correlated @xmath0exchange potential ( eq.([ab - sigma ] ) ) in this form ( allowing @xmath177 to be t ",
    "dependent ) we will get for the effective coupling constant @xmath178 the result ( with @xmath179 gev ) is shown in fig .  5 , together with the result of an updated model of ref .",
    "@xcite , hereafter referred to as model i , based on the diagrams in figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) , with the same value of @xmath180 .",
    "( details of this model will be given below . ) obviously our model predictions for the correlated @xmath0exchange in the scalar channel is in rough agreement with the @xmath21strength used before , which was phenomenologically adjusted to empirical @xmath35 data .",
    "however , our new result has a sizable t  dependence , which demonstrates clearly that it can not be well approximated by sharp mass @xmath21exchange with @xmath179gev .",
    "since it grows with @xmath181 , the contribution is shorter ranged , in complete consistency with the behaviour of the spectral function in fig .",
    "therefore , the effective mass exchanged should be higher . indeed , if we use @xmath182gev in eq.([coup - sig ] ) the result for @xmath183 , shown in the dashed curve of fig .",
    "5 , has almost no t  dependence .",
    "note that the analogous effective @xmath21mass for the @xmath36 system @xcite is @xmath184gev .",
    "let us now go to the @xmath8channel .",
    "starting from the lagrangians for sharp mass @xmath8exchange @xmath185 we get for the invariant amplitudes : @xmath186 with @xmath187 , @xmath188 .",
    "parametrizing again our correlated @xmath0exchange result ( eq.([ab - rhof ] ) resp .",
    "eq.([ab - rhog ] ) ) in this form we obtain for the effective @xmath8 coupling constants @xmath189 ( note that according to eqs.([ab - rhof ] , [ ab - rhog ] ) the s - dependence drops out . )    the results for @xmath190 and @xmath191 based on @xmath192 mev are shown in fig .  6 , again together with values used in model i.",
    "first we observe that there is a remarkable difference between the two alternatives for doing the dispersion relation in the @xmath8channel , _ i.e. _ , eq.([ab - rhof ] ) on one hand and eq.([ab - rhog ] ) on the other : the second method provides larger tensor ( @xmath191 ) but smaller vector coupling ( @xmath190 ) .",
    "consequently the ratio @xmath193 characterizing the tensor to vector coupling ratio of the ( effective ) @xmath8 to the nucleon , @xmath194 is much larger ( @xmath195 ) for the second than for the first choice ( @xmath196 ) .",
    "note also that the results based on the second choice are almost t  independent ; therefore , the result can be well identified with an exchange of an ( effective ) @xmath8 meson with the empirical mass . on the other hand ,",
    "the first method yields a result with a non ",
    "negligible t  dependence , with opposite behaviour for @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "therefore , given the lagrangians in eq.([l - rho ] ) , a common mass can not be assigned to the @xmath8channel result derived from the first choice .",
    "the situation is similar to the @xmath36 case ( cf .",
    "fig .  9 of ref .",
    "the only difference is that there all results scale by a factor of ( roughly ) 3 , in distinct disagreement with the su(3 ) value of 2 for the @xmath197 ratio .",
    "( note that there is an additional factor 2 due to the factor @xmath198 in the lagrangian used in @xcite . )",
    "this discrepancy should be of no surprise since there is no reason to expect that such effective exchanges generated by correlated @xmath0 exchange should fulfill the symmetry relations for exchanges of genuine particles .    in the sharp mass @xmath8model i",
    "the @xmath193 ratio has been taken from the bonn @xmath199 model potential @xcite to be 6.1 , only slightly larger than the correlated result based on eq.([ab - rhog ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the absolute values are much larger , by about a factor of 2 .",
    "note however , that in the following calculation of @xmath34 phase shifts and observables this discrepancy in the physical t region is much reduced since in this model a @xmath200 ( and @xmath201 ) formfactor of monopole type with a cutoff mass of only about twice the @xmath8mass are introduced , which suppress the @xmath8potentials by about a factor of 2 at t=0 .      in this section",
    "we confront our correlated @xmath0exchange model with the experimental @xmath9 data .",
    "our starting point is model b of ref .",
    "@xcite consisting of the diagrams shown in figs .",

    "as in ref .",
    "@xcite , most parameters ( coupling constants , cutoff masses ) are predetermined : coupling constants ( with the exception of @xmath206 and @xmath209 ) and cutoff masses belonging to @xmath199 and @xmath210 vertices are taken to be precisely the same as those of the ( full ) bonn @xmath199 potential @xcite . coupling constants at the vertices involving strange baryons ( @xmath211 , @xmath212 , @xmath213 )",
    "have been related by the assumption of su(6 ) symmetry to the empirical @xmath214 coupling , as in our hyperon  nucleon model @xcite .",
    "the three  meson coupling constants have been determined from the empirical @xmath215 coupling , assuming the same symmetry scheme and ideal mixing .",
    "the value of @xmath216 and some cutoff masses have been slightly readjusted to the empirical @xmath9 phase shifts below pion production threshold .",
    "this defines our model i. the values of parameters used in this model are given in table 1 ; the phase shifts which it yields are shown in the dotted curves of fig .  7 .",
    "obviously , the model based on phenomenological sharp mass @xmath21 and @xmath8exchange provides a fair description of the empirical situation , with slight improvements in the @xmath217 and @xmath218 phase shifts compared to ref .",

    ", some discrepancies occur between the various models .",
    "the main point however is that @xmath9 interactions based on a microscopic evaluation of correlated @xmath0 exchange are able to provide a reasonable description of empirical phase shifts .",
