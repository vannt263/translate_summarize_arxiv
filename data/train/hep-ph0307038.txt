    "for @xmath1 , the first measurements of this decay have been reported by the snd and cmd-2 collaborations . for the branching ratio they obtain @xmath17 @xcite and @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "more recently , the kloe collaboration has measured @xmath19 @xcite . in all the cases ,",
    "the spectrum is clearly peaked at @xmath20 mev , as expected from an important @xmath3 contribution .    for @xmath2 ,",
    "the branching ratios measured by the snd , cmd-2 and kloe collaborations are @xmath21 @xcite , @xmath22 @xcite , and @xmath23 @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "again , in all these cases , the observed mass spectrum shows a significant enhancement at large @xmath27 invariant mass that is interpreted as a manifestation of the dominant contribution of the @xmath28 intermediate state .    for @xmath5 ,",

    ", the @xmath11 decays proceed through the decay chain @xmath30 .",
    "the intermediate vectors exchanged are @xmath31 for @xmath1 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath2 , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath5 .",
    "the calculated branching ratios @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xcite are found ( for the first two processes ) to be substantially smaller than the experimental results .    later on ,",
    "the @xmath11 decays were studied in a chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) context enlarged to included on - shell vector mesons @xcite . in this formalism ,",
    "@xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "taking into account both chiral and vmd contributions , one finally obtains @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which are still below the experimental results , and @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "additional contributions are thus certainly required and the most natural candidates are the contributions coming from the exchange of scalar resonances .",
    "a first model including the scalar resonances explicitly is the _ no structure model _",

    "the previous two models include the scalar resonances _ ad hoc _ , and the pseudoscalar rescattering amplitudes are not chiral invariant .",
    "this problem is solved in the next two models which are based not only on the _ kaon loop model _ but also on chiral symmetry .",
