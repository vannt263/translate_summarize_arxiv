    "the strong sector of the standard model contains a number of inputs that are _ a priori _ unknown and must be determined from experiment .",
    "knowledge of these fundamental parameters , the quark masses and the strong coupling , also requires precise theoretical input , because of confinement : quarks and gluons can not be observed as isolated particles , hence one can only extract their properties by solving qcd for observable quantities such as hadron masses , as functions of the quark masses and the strong coupling .",
    "precise values of the quark masses in particular are valuable in many phenomenological applications , such as in placing constraints on new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "recent breakthroughs in lattice qcd are having a significant impact on the determination of many hadronic quantities .",
    "these advances are due to two related developments : the use of perturbation theory in the design of so - called improved - lattice discretizations @xcite , which significantly reduces cutoff effects ; and numerical simulations of a highly - efficient formalism ( using so - called `` staggered '' quarks ) , where the correct number of light - quark flavors can be included in the dirac sea , and at sufficiently small quark masses @xcite , enabling accurate chiral extrapolations to the physical region @xcite .",
    "these developments have eliminated the large and frequently uncontrolled systematic uncertainties inherent in most other lattice qcd studies , where the effects of sea quarks are either completely neglected ( working in the so - called `` quenched '' approximation ) , or where the simulations are done with the wrong number of sea quarks ( and at very heavy masses ) : comparison of the predictions of such unrealistic theories with experiment reveals typical inconsistencies of 1020% , which precludes their use in many important phenomenological applications .",
    "recent work by our group , the high precision qcd ( hpqcd ) collaboration , together with the fermilab and milc collaborations , has instead utilized unquenched simulations with up , down and strange quarks in the dirac sea .",
    "these simulations are made computationally feasible by using the @xmath12-improved staggered - quark action ( @xmath13 is the lattice spacing ) , with the one - loop @xmath12-improved gluon action ( hereafter collectively referred to as the `` asqtad '' action @xcite ) .",
    "we have shown that these three - flavor simulations give results for a wide variety of observables that agree with experiment to within systematic errors of 3% or less @xcite .",
    "this precision , and the unified description of hadronic physics in many different systems , is a striking consequence of having a realistic description of the dirac sea .",
    "the application of this program to many other quantities of interest requires additional use of perturbation theory , in order to properly match lattice discretizations of the relevant operators and couplings onto continuum qcd .",
    "these perturbative - matching calculations must generally be carried out at next - to - next - to - leading order ( `` nnlo '' order , which is generally equivalent to two - loop feynman diagrams ) , if one is to obtain results of a few - percent precision @xcite .",
    "the success of this approach has been demonstrated by a recent hpqcd determination of the strong coupling at nnlo order , with the result @xmath14 @xcite , the most accurate of any method .    in this paper",
    "we apply our perturbation theory program to make the first - ever nnlo determination of the light - quark masses ( the computationally - simpler case of the additive zero - point renormalization for wilson fermions was previously computed at two - loop order in ref .",
    "@xcite , and for static quarks in ref .",
    "the quark masses are not physically measurable , and as such are only well defined in certain renormalization schemes , such as the  mass @xmath15 , evaluated at some relevant scale @xmath16 .",
    "we have done the necessary perturbative matching calculations to connect the lattice - regularized bare mass @xmath17 for the `` asqtad '' action , as a function of the lattice spacing , to @xmath15 .",
    "the lattice spacings and bare quark masses are required as input , and these have been determined in earlier studies .",
    "the lattice spacings we use were determined ultimately from the @xmath18 mass difference @xcite , which is insensitive to the quark masses ; the results agree within systematic errors of 1.53% with the lattice spacing extracted from a wide variety of other physical quantities @xcite ; this eliminates an uncontrolled systematic error in studies that are done without the correct number of sea quarks .",
    "the bare quark masses have previously been determined in a joint hpqcd and milc collaboration study @xcite , using partially - quenched chiral - perturbation theory @xcite to make precise extrapolations to the physical region ; the simulations used equal dynamical @xmath19 quark masses as small as @xmath5 .",
    "these bare masses were used in ref .",
    "@xcite to estimate the  masses using one - loop perturbation theory @xcite ; the dominant systematic error in that determination came from unknown second and higher orders in the perturbative matching .",
    "significant progress is made here due to our computation of the second - order perturbative matching coefficient .",
    "we thereby reduce the systematic error from perturbation theory by about a factor of two compared to the earlier result of ref .",
    "the remaining perturbative error is the same size as the current lattice systematic error , which is largely due to the chiral extrapolation / interpolation .",
    "the staggered - quark formalism had previously been afflicted with several poorly - understood problems , which have been tamed with an aggressive program of perturbative improvement , leading to the `` asqtad '' action that we are using here . with an unimproved - staggered action",
    "large discretization errors appear , although they are formally only @xmath20 or higher .",
    "many of the renormalization factors required to match lattice operators onto continuum quantities are also large and poorly convergent in perturbation theory for unimproved - staggered quarks ; this is true , for example , of the mass renormalization that is needed here .",
    "it turns out that both problems have the same source , a particular form of discretization error dubbed `` taste violation , '' and both are ameliorated by use of the improved - staggered formalism @xcite .",
    "the perturbation theory then shows small renormalizations @xcite , and discretization errors are much reduced @xcite .",
    "taste violation is strongly probed in certain quantities , notably the would - be goldstone meson masses which play an important role in our analysis , and these effects are taken into account in the staggered chiral - perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "a potentially more fundamental concern about staggered fermions relates to the need to take the fourth root of the quark determinant , in order to convert the four - fold duplication of `` tastes '' into one quark flavor .",
    "one might imagine that the fourth root would introduce nonlocalities ( and would induce violations of unitarity ) , which would prevent decoupling of the ultraviolet modes of the theory in the continuum limit .",
    "however a great deal of theoretical evidence has been amassed which demonstrates that the properties of the staggered theory , with the fourth root , are equivalent to a one - flavor theory , up to the expected discretization errors @xcite ; these are again due to short - distance taste - changing interactions , which are mediated by high - momentum gluons @xcite .",
    "the locality of the free - field staggered theory is trivial , and is made manifest in the `` naive '' basis used in ref .",
    "non - localities do not arise in perturbation theory , since the staggered - quark matrix is diagonal in the taste basis , up to those short - distance ( and calculable ) corrections .",
    "most important , it has been shown that perturbative improvement of staggered actions correlates exceedingly well with nonperturbatively - measured properties of the staggered - fermion matrix , providing clear support for the correctness of the fourth - root procedure .",
    "this includes the measured pattern of low - lying eigenvalues of the staggered matrix @xcite , and the measured pattern of taste - violating mass differences in the non - chiral pions @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",

    "the results presented here have a number of distinguishing features : two - loop perturbation theory ; @xmath153 simulations with two degenerate light quarks and a heavier strange quark ; very small light quark masses from @xmath5 to @xmath154 which enabled a partially quenched chiral fit with many terms to thousands of configurations ; and extremely accurate determinations of the lattice spacings , which are equal within small errors when set from any of a wide variety of hadronic inputs .",
    "most notable amongst our results is our new value for strange quark mass , @xmath155 , where the respective errors are lattice statistical , lattice systematic ( mostly due to the chiral extrapolation / interpolation ) , perturbative , and due to electromagnetic / isospin effects .",
    "the two - loop matching has increased the central value of our estimates of the light - quark masses with respect to our previous one - loop determination @xcite by about 1.5 standard deviations , based on the previous estimate of the perturbation - theory uncertainty .",
    "the systematic uncertainty from perturbation theory has been reduced by about a factor of two , and is now only about 4% , the same size as the current lattice systematic uncertainty , the latter due mainly to the chiral extrapolation / interpolation .",
    "we anticipate that the present estimate of the perturbative uncertainty could be reduced somewhat further , if additional lattice spacings become available , by using the nnlo perturbation theory presented here to improve the estimate of the third - order perturbative correction , along the lines that we have implemented above .",
    "the strange - quark mass determination has historically generated some controversy , with widely different values having been obtained from different approaches .",
    "this is reflected in the large uncertainty in the particle data group s most recent best estimate , @xmath156  mev @xcite ; our result represents a significant improvement in precision , resulting from an aggressive effort to understand and reduce all sources of systematic error .",
    "an obvious advantage of our result is that it has been obtained with the correct description of the sea , that is , with @xmath153 flavors of dynamical quarks .",
    "there is only one other three - flavor result , which is due to the cp - pacs and jlqcd collaborations ( which did simulations at much larger @xmath19 quark masses than in the milc `` asqtad '' ensembles ) , which recently reported a value of @xmath157  mev @xcite ; however they do not include a full error analysis , and in particular the error from missing higher orders in the perturbative matching alone should be comparable to that in our older result , and significantly larger than the errors that we report here with a 2-loop analysis .",
    "it appears that the most recent estimates of the strange - quark mass extracted from simulations with only two flavors of sea quarks are systematically higher than the estimates with the correct @xmath158 , although the other systematic errors are too large to allow for a definitive assessment ( noting that these two - flavor determinations were also done with different definitions of the quark mass and determinations of the lattice spacing from @xmath159 using different physical values for @xmath159 ) .",
    "the two - flavor determination from the qcdsf - ukqcd collaboration is @xmath160  mev @xcite , the alpha collaboration value is @xmath161  mev @xcite , and the rome value is @xmath162  mev @xcite . in this connection , we analyzed quenched simulations of the `` asqtad '' action by the milc collaboration @xcite , and we find that this also leads to a somewhat larger value of the strange quark mass , of about 96  mev quenched ( using simple linear interpolations of the milc quenched - meson spectrum results , and our two - loop perturbative matching formula at @xmath62 ) .",
    "we are currently in the process of applying our nnlo matching calculation to heavy - quark masses , in order to complete a high - precision determination of the fundamental parameters of qcd .",
    "work is also underway on the nnlo matching calculations for important hadronic matrix elements , especially those such as the decay constants @xmath163 and @xmath164 and other form - factors of particular relevance to heavy - flavor physics .",
    "this work was supported by the us department of energy , the us national science foundation , the natural science and engineering research council of canada , the particle physics and astronomy research council of the uk , and barclays capital .",
