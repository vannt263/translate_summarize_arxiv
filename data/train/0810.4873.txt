    "magnetic fields play an important , but poorly understood , role in the formation and further evolution of late - type stars .",
    "the influence of magnetic fields in stellar environments can be seen , for example , in x - ray emission from gas which has been magnetically heated to coronal temperatures , and radio emission arising from the action of nonthermal particles in the presence of magnetic fields . in the last 20 years",
    ", remarkable advances in the detection and study of stellar sources at x - ray and radio wavelengths have revealed an intimate connection between radio and x - ray luminosities of late - type stars .",
    "this relationship extends from time - averaged estimates of the presumably steady emission , to spectacular examples of flare enhancements when studied simultaneously with multiple wavelengths .",
    "yet the underlying connection is still not well constrained .",
    "most of the observational multi - wavelength studies of magnetically - induced flare activity on late - type stars have concentrated on targeted studies of nearby , extremely active stars .",
    "the goal of the current project is to investigate a region of active star formation , using simultaneous x - ray and radio observations , to constrain the relationship of these emissions in both steady and varying emission .",
    "this will allow us to determine the extent to which the solar paradigm can be carried in these very active young stars .      at first glance",
    ", there is an obvious disconnect between x - ray and radio emission from active stars : x - ray observations are well described by optically thin , thermal , high temperature plasma generally seen in a distribution between a few mk and tens of mk ( few kev ) , while radio observations generally probe nonthermal populations of accelerated electrons with energies of a few mev . yet among several classes of active stars and solar flares , a tight relation between x - ray and radio luminosities is found , l@xmath1l@xmath2 @xmath3 hz @xcite .",
    "this relation extends from solar microflares up to the most energetic coronal sources ( in radio and x - rays ) : the weak t tauri stars ( wtts ; class iii objects ) .",
    "the observational relationship invites an interpretation based on a common origin  particle acceleration and thermal coronal heating , separate but related steps in the flow of energy after a magnetic reconnection event , as inferred from solar and stellar flare studies . on the sun ,",
    "the observed relationship between nonthermal processes and thermal coronal emission during individual transient impulsive flare events is well known @xcite and has given rise to a standard flare scenario .",
    "particles are accelerated high in the corona in connection with a reconnection event , and downwardly - directed electron beams `` inject '' these energetic particles into coronal loops , which act as a magnetic trap .",
    "radio gyrosynchrotron emission occurs from trapped particles ; those which precipitate due to pitch - angle scattering encounter the dense chromosphere where they are collisionally stopped , depositing their energy in the ambient plasma .",
    "the temperate chromospheric material becomes heated to coronal temperatures on timescales short compared with the hydrodynamic expansion timescale , and undergoes a radiative instability , expanding up into the corona , where the high temperature gas radiates at x - ray wavelengths .",
    "the x - ray radiation increases gradually during the impulsive particle acceleration episode , reaching a peak after the acceleration has ended and subsequently declining to previous values @xcite .",
    "radio gyrosynchrotron emission from the accelerated electrons is roughly proportional to the injection rate of electrons , whereas the x - ray luminosity is roughly proportional to the accumulated energy in the hot plasma .",
    "this simple scenario gives rise to the observed l@xmath4 seen in the sun ; as the amount of nonthermal energy input ( diagnosed by the radio emission ) increases , the thermal radiative output ( x - ray emission ) also increases , until the acceleration and subsequent heating ceases and the system settles back into quiescence .",
    "observations of some stellar flares at multiple wavelengths confirm this scenario for a variety of active stars @xcite , yet there is also ample evidence that the situation on stars is more complex .",
    "either thermal or nonthermal radio emission from young stellar objects can be expected to be present .",
    "thermal sources are more likely to be identified with disks , or with higher mass objects with winds @xcite ; nonthermal emission is associated with particle acceleration and magnetic reconnection . based on the classification sequence of young stellar objects from infalling protostar to wtts and the decreasing relative importance of accretion and disk material versus magnetic activity",

    "* ) , we expect that class 0 , i and ii ( a.k.a classical t tauri stars ; ctts ) sources will be more dominantly thermal radio sources , while class iii sources are potential nonthermal radio sources . there are observations which suggest that nonthermal radio emission has been detected in a few class i objects @xcite , raising the possibility that nonthermal diagnostics of magnetic activity can be produced in class i and ii objects , but obscured by free - free absorption in the accretion disk or wind .",
    "these two cases can be discerned with multi - frequency radio observations , as the spectral shape of the continuum emission will be different .",
    "nonthermal emission can additionally be discerned due to short time - scale variability from magnetic reconnection processes ; circular polarization from structures containing large - scale magnetic fields provides an additional observational constraint .",
    "in addition to gyrosynchrotron emission in t tauri stars , evidence exists also for coherent emission ( highly circularly polarized emission ; * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray and radio emission from wtts are enhanced orders of magnitude above the sun and most active stars variability extremes , signaling a possible extension of the trends from the lower activity stars , or a transition to a new kind of phenomenon .",
    "t tauri stars show similar behaviors to the well - studied active stars ( and the sun itself )  starspots , luminous x - ray and radio emission , enhanced chromospheric emission @xcite , signalling the importance of magnetic fields in producing these signatures in young stars as well .",
    "magnetic fields have been measured on the surfaces of young stars @xcite ; while their generation in wtts is probably not due to an interface dynamo as in the sun due to the fully or nearly fully convective nature of wtts , alternative explanations such as convective or turbulent dynamos ( described in @xcite and @xcite ) may be responsible for magnetic field production in wtts .",
    "it is not known to what extent magnetic activity phenomena are affected by circumstellar material and/or jets and ionized winds , as can be found around young low - mass stars .",
    "while some wtts do show correlations between non - simultaneously obtained time - averaged x - ray and radio luminosities @xcite , other studies have found little or no correlation between these luminosities or their variability @xcite .",
    "confirmation of the complex nature of magnetic activity signatures also arises from the lack of multi - wavelength correlations between x - ray and radio emission in class  i sources @xcite .",
    "radio observations are an inefficient method of finding cluster objects , due to the low radio detection rates : radio surveys find radio emission rates of @xmath510% for ctts ( generally objects associated with optical jets and herbig haro objects , * ? ? ?",

    "the asymmetry in multi - wavelength associations for young stars was pointed out by @xcite , who noted from their study of the @xmath7 oph core that a majority of stellar radio sources are detected at x - ray and ir wavelengths , but the converse is not true .",
    "@xcite found similar results in the @xmath7 ophiuchi cloud ; in their study , 10 sources were detected at both radio and x - ray wavelengths , compared with 31 radio sources and 87 x - ray sources .",
    "biases from distance , sensivity , and variability play a role in these trends . despite the low radio detection rate ,",
    "radio observations are important in the context of magnetic activity signatures in that they providue unique diagnostics of accelerated electrons unavailable at other wavelengths , and deep observations can reveal new sources heretofore undetected in shallow radio surveys .",
    "the purview of radio variability studies on t tauri stars have usually been long timescales of months to years , due to the survey nature of most of the radio observations .",
    "there is some evidence that similar features are seen in radio flares from wtts as on hyperactive stars : short timescale ( hrs ) flux enhancements @xcite , spectral index increases during flux enhancements signalling switch from optically thin to optically thick emission @xcite , and detection of circular polarization @xcite .",

    "iras data show 100@xmath10 m emission extending 30@xmath11 around the star .",
    "recent observations by @xcite have discovered that this star possesses a disk which is nearly face on , and shows evidence of a secondary star .",
    "this cluster was originally identified by the `` necklace of radio sources '' around the central star lkh@xmath0101 ( * ? ? ?",

    "acis - i and vla observations of a young pms cluster to bridge the gap between the well - studied x - ray  radio connection of the nearby active stars and that of the more distant and more common ( and potentially more magnetically active ) pre - main sequence stars .",
    "such studies of high energy processes in star forming regions have the advantage of numerous stars in the field of view to increase the `` stellar monitoring time '' and thereby increase the likelihood of observing transient emissions .",

    "5 discusses the implications of the results , and  6 concludes .",
    "the primary goal of this program was the simultaneous @xmath14 and vla observations to investigate variability in active young stars . to achieve the desired sensitivity in the x - ray bands we required 80ks ( 22hr ) total observation time . in order to enable nearly completely simultaneous coverage of the @xmath14 observations with the vla , we divided the 80 ks into two 40  ks ( 11 hr ) observations separated by 2 days , occurring on 6 and 8 march , 2005 .",
    "we also drew on available non - contemporaneous 2mass and @xmath15 data to help elucidate the nature of the sources in the field . a companion paper ( wolk et al .",
    ", in prep .",
    ", hereafter paper  ii ) presents a detailed analysis of the chandra and _ spitzer _ data and accompanying optical data including 2mass , spitzer irac as well as mips 24 @xmath10 m data . for the present purposes we use the derived x - ray and ir source positions , ir photometry , and x - ray variability and spectral shape to construct a better picture of the radio sources . in this section",
    ", we outline the observations and basic reduction of the radio and x - ray data .",
    "the lkh@xmath0101 cluster was observed by the vla in march 2005 in project s60872 . the observing setup consisted of splitting the array into two sub - arrays , and observing simultaneously at 3.6 and 6 cm .",
    "observations were obtained in this fashion on 6 and 8 march , for observing sessions spanning 10.5 and 11 hours , respectively .",
    "the approximate full width at half maximum of the primary beam at 3.6 and 6 cm is 5.3 and 9.4 arcminutes , respectively , meaning that the longer wavelength has sensitivity extending over larger distances from the cluster center .",
    "thus , while there was only one pointing direction , limiting the field of view to a fraction of the chandra field , the deep exposure combined with simultaneous multi - frequency recording ensures an ability to constrain the nature of short time - scale variability for radio - emitting sources within @xmath65@xmath16  of lkh@xmath0101 .",
    "the phase center of the observations , or `` aimpoint '' , was 2@xmath12  south of lkh@xmath0101 .",
    "the array was in b configuration , affording a reasonable compromise between spatial resolution and wide - field coverage ; as the bright central be star is the source of a radio - bright h  ii region there is a fair amount of extended emission .",
    "radio data was reduced and calibrated in aips ; the primary flux calibrator was 3c48 and the phase calibrator was 0414 + 343 .",
    "after the initial calibration , phase self - calibration of the cluster was done using the bright central source .",
    "because of the large amount of extended emission from the nebula , visible at small @xmath17 distances , images were made with restricted baseline lengths ; after examining the behavior of the correlated flux versus baseline , x - band ( 3.6 cm ) maps were made with @xmath17 distances restricted to 30300 k@xmath18 , c - band ( 6 cm ) maps were made with @xmath17 distances restricted to 10200 k@xmath18 . even with these @xmath17-range restrictions",
    ", there appear to be radio - emitting structures larger than the fringe spacing of the shortest baselines ; dark bowls around the central object and large - scale stripes in the image ( particularly at 6 cm ) indicate this .",
    "images at each frequency were made using visibilities for each day as well as combined for both days ; thus 6 maps of the region around lkh@xmath0101 were generated and searched for radio sources .",
    "the maps were corrected for the primary beam by dividing by the primary beam gain factor .",
    "c - band maps were made using pixel sizes of 0.3@xmath12@xmath19pixel , x - band maps made with 0.15@xmath12@xmath19pixel , with image sizes 2048 pixels , corresponding to 5.1@xmath16   and 10.2@xmath16   for x and c - bands , respectively , thus covering the fwhm of the primary beam .",
    "however , the non - monochromatic nature of the radio emission results in the intensity of a point source being reduced at larger distances from the pointing center ; the total ( integrated ) flux is preserved but the peak flux decreases in proportion to the bandwidth relative to central frequency , and the source offset in units of the synthesized beam . because source detection is based on peak flux density exceeding a threshhold , the effect of bandwidth smearing will degrade our attempts to find weak point sources far from the center of the cluster .",
    "in addition to creating images of total intensity at each wavelength , we also imaged the same regions in stokes v to search for any significant amount of circularly polarized flux , as has been noted from previous observations of young stellar objects @xcite .",
    "we did not detect any statistically significant levels of circularly polarized flux .",
    "the stokes v image rms at 3.6 cm was 10 @xmath10jy , and the stokes v image rms at 6 cm was 13@xmath10jy .",
    "we generated a catalog of previously detected radio sources in this cluster , using the source lists of @xcite and @xcite , precessed to j2000 coordinates .",
    "we follow the simbad naming convention for these sources based on their designators in these two papers .",
    "in addition we searched for new sources in the combined maps at each frequency .",
    "all radio sources were given names in accordance with iau convention , and have the acronym `` lkha101vla '' accompanied by a sequence giving the j2000 coordinates , although we retain the use of the earlier names in previously identified objects .",
    "based on our initial visual inspection of the combined images , six new sources were identified using a minimum signal to noise ( peak / rms ) of 5 .",
    "we added these positions to the catalog of previously identified sources , and performed a systematic determination of fluxes at each frequency and observing day : fits were done to an 11 @xmath20 11 pixel square around the source coordinates when converted from ra , dec to image pixel location . for previously identified sources , we recorded a detection if the signal to noise ratio exceeded 3 .",
    "fluxes were determined by two - dimensional gaussian fits to the primary beam - corrected images .",
    "correction for bandwidth smearing was done . for previously detected sources , we determined the flux or upper limit at the position of the source as noted in other papers .",
    "some previously identified sources were not within the field of view of our observations .",
    "table  [ tbl : radiotbl1 ] lists the 3.6 and 6 cm fluxes obtained from co - adding all the data from this epoch , as well as previously reported flux densities , taken from the literature @xcite .",
    "the field was observed by @xmath14 on 6 march 2005 starting at 17:16 ut for 40.2 ks of total time and 39.6 ks of so - called `` good - time '' ( obsid 5429 ) .",
    "it was observed again on 8 march 2005 starting at 17:43 ut for essentially the same duration ( obsid 5428 ) .",
    "the acis was used in the nominal imaging array ( chips i0-i3 ) which provides a field of view of approximately 17@xmath20 17 .",
    "the aimpoint was at 04:30:14.4 , + 35:16:22.2 ( j2000.0 ) with a roll of 281 degrees .",
    "the data were processed through the standard ciao pipeline at the chandra x - ray center , using their software version ds7.6 . for the purposes of point source detection ,",
    "the data from the two observations were merged into a single event list following established ciao procedures to create a merged event list . to identify point sources , photons with energies below 300 ev and above 8.0 kev",
    "were filtered out from this merged event list .",
    "a monochromatic exposure map was generated in the standard way using an energy of 1.49 kev which is a reasonable match to the expected peak energy of the sources and the @xmath14 mirror transmission .",
    "wavdetect was then run on a series of flux corrected images binned by 1 , 2 and 4 pixels .",
    "the resulting source lists were combined and this resulted in the detection of about 210 sources .",
    "detailed description of x - ray data reduction , and analysis , including point source extraction and flux estimation , is given in paper  ii .",
    "the vla source positions were searched against the irac point source catalog ( from paper  ii ) for matches .",
    "an offset of 1@xmath12  produced a total of 7 matches ; relaxing the required positional coincidence to as much as 4 @xmath12  did not produce any additional matches . of these",
    ", 4 are class  iii objects , 2 are class  ii objects , and one ( the central star lkh@xmath0 101 ) is classed as unknown .",
    "the vla source positions were also cross - correlated against the chandra source positions , with a positional coincidence of 1@xmath12  allowed for x - ray sources within 200@xmath12  of the pointing center , and 2.5@xmath12  allowed for x - ray sources greater than 200@xmath12  from the pointing center . within 5@xmath16  of lkh@xmath0101 , there are 132 x - ray sources , with 100 having counterparts in the ir catalog , 2 being class  i , 35 being class  ii , 40 being class  iii , and 23 being of unknown type .",
    "figure  [ fig : xrayvlafield ] shows the portion of the chandra image covered by the vla field , with positions of radio sources indicated .",
    "using the analytic expressions in @xcite for the 1 @xmath21 confidence limits for small numbers of events in poisson statistics , the rate of radio emission for x - ray - emitting class  ii objects is 2/35 or 6@xmath22% , and for class  iii objects it is 4/40 or 10@xmath23% .",
    "we also searched the tables of @xcite for correspondences with radio sources .",
    "the identification of the radio sources at other wavelengths is given in table  [ tbl : idtbl ] .",
    "the radio observations reported on the sources around lkh@xmath0101 span @xmath620 years with the vla , taken at different frequencies and configurations . because several sources have reported flux densities at only one epoch , and because we expect variability to be a key characteristic of some of these sources , we extracted the previous epochs from the vla archive , reduced , calibrated and imaged the data , and fitted gaussians at the reported positions of all sources .",
    "we reproduced three out of the four epochs reported in bw88 , as the fourth epoch ( reported to have occurred on 1986 may 12 ) was not in nrao s on - line archive .",
    "we found different flux densities for [ bw88 ] 7 and 8 on 1986 april 25 : our fitted flux density for source 7 was consistent with that reported in bw88 for source 8 , and vice versa .",
    "this may be the result of typographical error .",
    "we could not recover the new sources which were described in so98 with our evaluation of the archival data .",
    "although fluxes at @xmath243@xmath21 uncertainty were determined at these positions in other epochs , the unrecoverability of the sources along with absence of supporting data at other wavelengths led us to exclude the so98 sources from consideration in subsequent analyses .",
    "table  [ tbl : radiotbl1 ] lists the flux densities for sources as reported in bw88 , so98 , and by combining the data from our two days of observations .",
    "the estimated number of foreground x - ray sources is small , and should not contaminate the sample of x - ray and radio coincidences .",
    "our limiting x - ray sensitivity is about 10@xmath25 in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band (  3.5 ) .",
    "the results from the champlane @xcite survey for @xmath14 fields in the plane of the galaxy _ but _ away from the galactic core indicate that we can expect to find about 70 background agn , cataclysmic variables , neutron stars , black holes , and other non  pms star point sources in a sample of 15 acis observations in the galactic plane , but not pointed at the galactic center , @xmath26 , sensitive to similar flux levels as we have .",
    "the number is most likely lower than this due to the nearly opaque nature of the dust clouds in the central @xmath640% of the field , perhaps 45 total , or only @xmath64 x - ray non - pms point sources scaled to the 5 @xmath16overlap between the @xmath14 field and the vla 3.6 cm field , or a contamination of only 3% of the x - ray sources .",
    "many of these are among the faint x - ray sources , x - ray sources with no optical / ir counterparts or the sources with offset between the x - ray position and optical / ir position exceeding 4@xmath12 .",
    "it is unlikely that the radio sources lacking x - ray and ir / optical counterparts are foreground sources .",
    "as discussed in  3.2 , most of these objects have negative radio spectral indices , indicating nonthermal emission .",
    "galactic sources of nonthermal radio emission should also produce nonthermal x - ray emission at a level above our detection limit ( see  3.5 ) ; the lack of x - ray detection implies a ratio of x - ray to radio flux less than @xmath276@xmath2010@xmath28 hz . the lack of infrared or optical counterparts also constrains the presence of possible thermal radio sources ; as discussed in the following paragraph , the spitzer maps are sensitive to cluster members near the substellar mass limit , and foreground stellar objects will be brighter . in order to produce thermal emission at radio wavelengths but faint optical light a distance modulus that would place the objects beyond the cluster ( and therefore not a foreground object ) would be needed .",
    "additionally , the space density of galactic foreground objects capable of being radio - bright but optical or x - ray faint is small enough that within the 5@xmath16  radius of lkh@xmath0101 we do not expect to see any of these sources .",
    "we estimate the upper limit on ir magnitude for an object not to be detected in the irac bands , using the background levels due to nebulosity at the positions of the radio sources .",
    "we searched for the faintest star within 36@xmath12of the position of each radio source not having an ir detection , and grouped sources with similar amounts of background .",
    "we find typical limits in jhk of 17 , 15.5 , and 15.3 , respectively . at a distance modulus of 9.225",
    ", a @xmath29 of 15.3 corresponds roughly to an absolute k magnitude of @xmath66 .",
    "according to @xcite a 1my star with 0.1 m@xmath30 would have a k@xmath31=4.39 .",
    "dusty models @xcite predict k@xmath31=6 for a 0.06 m@xmath30 star , near the stellar - substellar boundary .",
    "thus , the lack of an ir counterpart to apparent cluster members which are detected at other wavelengths may indicate that the object is a very low mass star or brown dwarf .",
    "eight of the radio sources considered here remain without a counterpart at x - ray or ir wavelengths .",
    "the reliability of these sources can be examined by the number of epochs or frequences at which each source has been detected .",
    "these eight sources have each been detected at more than one frequency or epoch ; one source ( lkha101 j043004.0 + 351817 ) was identified in our observations at a single frequency on both days , as well as being marginally detected in the archival data from 1985 april ( see table  [ tbl : radiotbl1 ] ) .",
    "all of these sources are detected at @xmath245 @xmath21 .",
    "several of these are possible extragalactic sources .",
    "@xcite identified their source [ bw88 ]  5 as an extragalactic double .",
    "a check of the nrao vla sky survey @xcite reveals three sources near lkh@xmath0 101 which are coincident ( to less than 10  ) with sources [ bw88 ]  7 , [ bw88 ]  5 , and [ bw88 ]  2 .",
    "as the integrated flux densities of these nvss sources at 20 cm are 5.5 , 4.1 , and 3 mjy , respectively , which are all higher than the range of flux densities reported at the higher frequencies considered here , it is likely that these are extragalactic sources with steep radio spectral indices .",
    "the lack of coincidence with x - ray or ir sources supports this conjecture . using a model for the 1.4 ghz extragalactic source counts , and converting from 1.4 ghz to 8.4 ghz using a spectral index of @xmath0=-0.7 , 5@xmath32",
    "sources are expected in a circle of diameter 5.3 with flux density greater than the 3 @xmath21 rms at 8.4 ghz of 36 @xmath10jy ( j. condon , private communication ) .",
    "this is consistent with all 8 radio sources lacking a counterpart at other wavelengths being extragalactic in nature .",
    "the parameter which describes the shape of continuum radio emission is the spectral index @xmath0 , defined as @xmath33 ; generally , for @xmath34 0.5 the spectrum is rising , for @xmath35 the spectrum is falling , and in between ( @xmath36 ) the spectrum is considered flat .",
    "rising spectra can generally be associated with optically thick thermal emission , falling spectra with optically thin nonthermal emission .",
    "flat spectra could , in principle , be associated with either , but usually indicate nonthermal emission from an inhomogeneous source . most of the sources for which spectral index constraints are available indicate negative spectral indices and consequently a nonthermal interpretation .",
    "table  [ tbl : radiotbl1 ] lists the spectral index derived from maps made by combining the two days of radio observations reported here ; 13 objects have constraints on spectral index from detection at one or more frequencies .",
    "eight of the 13 have spectral indices which are flat and slightly negative ( @xmath37 ) ; two are steeply negative ( @xmath38 ) ; another two have large positive spectral indexes , one of which is the central star to the cluster , lkh@xmath0101 , and the other is a newly discovered source .",
    "based on the multi - wavelength source identifications discussed in ",
    "[ sec : rxrir ] , four objects with ir or x - ray detections have spectral index constraints , and 3/4 of these have negative spectral indices .",

    "table  [ tbl : radiotbl2 ] lists the spectral index measurements on each day .",
    "these are generally consistent with the values determined from the combined maps .",
    "the discrepant sources appear to have varied more at one wavelength than at the other .",
    "this behavior is discussed more in section  [ sec : avar ] .        in order to assess long - term radio variability , we considered the five epochs of 6 cm observations .",
    "we determined an object s variability over the timescale of @xmath6 20 years by examining the range of recorded flux values ( including epochs where only upper limits were obtained ) and determining how many @xmath21 this range represents , using the largest measurement error .",
    "flux determination can be affected by the beam size ( if the object is slightly resolved ) , distance from the phase center , and contribution of background nebulosity .",
    "since the observations were made in different array configurations , we place a conservative limit of 10@xmath21 on the range of maximum to minimum flux values to assess variability . using this criterion ,",
    "4 out of 9 sources can be considered variable ; for objects detected on 4 or more occasions , only two can be considered variable .",

    "it is entirely possible that with a complex field geometry , x - ray and radio - emitting regions are physically distinct from each other , with separate energy reservoirs . if this is the case , no relationship between the two emergent intensities is to be expected .",
    "figure  [ lxlr ] displays the ratio of the luminosities against x - ray luminosity .",
    "there is a statistically significant anti - correlation between this luminosity ratio and the x - ray luminosity ; the discrepancy between the observed luminosity ratio and that expected from the gb relationship grows as the x - ray luminosity decreases .",
    "it is likely that [ bw88 ]  1 , the most extreme object exhibiting this relationship , is a very low mass star or brown dwarf ( see discussion in  3.1 ) .",
    "the luminosity ratio relates the efficiency of particle acceleration ( through the production of nonthermal radio emission ) to that of plasma heating ( through the production of x - ray emission ) .",
    "although the gb relationship implies a nearly constant amount of particle acceleration relative to plasma heating , the results for the young stellar objects around lkh@xmath0101 indicate that this parameter depends on the amount of plasma heating , and thus implies a decoupling of particle acceleration from plasma heating .",
    "the lack of correlation between radio and x - ray measurements can also be seen in the comparison of short time - scale variability : the amount of radio variability between the two days of observations is larger than the corresponding range in x - ray flux in the sample of objects detected at both wavelengths .",
    "out of 8 sources detected at both x - ray and radio wavelengths , variability at both wavelengths is seen in only two cases ( [ bw88 ]  3 , lkha101vla j0429540.+351848 ) . yet",
    ", two objects appeared to be undergoing short time - scale variability ( [ bw88 ]  3 , [ bw88 ]  1 ) , while no x - ray flares were seen .",
    "the comparison of x - ray and radio variability is shown in figure  [ fig : xrr ] for the three objects having significant radio detections , to probe variability in both .",
    "variability appears to be a greater factor in the production of radio emission than it is in x - ray emission .",
    "there has been a paucity of simultaneous radio and x - ray observations of young stars , despite the large potential for learning about magnetic fields and interrelation of plasma heating and particle acceleration .",
    "the small number of cases in hand suggest a different scenario from that gleaned from studies of the sun and nearby active stars .",
    "simultaneous multi - wavelength observations of hd  283447 by @xcite revealed a radio flare but no x - ray or chromospheric variability .",
    "they concluded that the regions of gyrosynchrotron emission were largely decoupled from the regions where plasma heating was occurring .",
    "@xcite serendipitously observed a giant outburst at mm- wavelengths during the coup observation ; an intense x - ray flare on the same star began 3 days prior to the observed radio flare and lasted through the duration of the radio flare .",
    "@xcite found a star , doar 21 , in the @xmath7 opch cloud core to be in the the decay phase of an x - ray flare with stable emission at 6 cm . these examples are opposite to the classic `` neupert effect '' and suggestive of a different flare scenario .",
    "time - averaged correlations also show a different behavior in young stellar objects .",
    "@xcite found no evidence that x - ray and radio luminosities are correlated as expected in the gb relationship for a small sample of tts in the @xmath7 ophiucus cloud .",
    "observations of class  i sources in the coronet cluster @xcite similarly show no clear correlations between radio and x - ray emission as should appear in the gb relationship if particle acceleration and plasma heating arise from a common energy reservoir .",
    "our finding of a decoupling between radio and x - ray emission in both a time - averaged and time variable sense supports the idea that the structures giving rise to the two emissions in young stellar objects are physically or energetically distinct .",
    "we find as a common theme that there is a different scenario for magnetic activity in the young stellar objects around lkh@xmath0101 than is usually seen in the sun and active stars .",
    "this is revealed by a comparison between radio flux versus spectral index behavior , which suggests for the young stellar objects studied here rapid particle acceleration and injection .",
    "the interpretation of the dependence of radio to x - ray luminosity ratio on x - ray luminosity is that the efficiency of particle acceleration relative to plasma heating depends on the amount of plasma heating , rather than being relatively independent as for active stars and the sun .",
    "we investigated the coronal structures which could be giving rise to the radio and x - ray emission , and find several lines of evidence that such a decoupling is occurring .",
    "the x - ray emitting loops are optically thick to radio emission at the wavelengths observed , so the detected amounts of radio and x - ray emission can not be coming from co - spatial loops .",
    "the isolation of radio- and x - ray emitting material is also consistent with one interpretation of the lack of expected roughly linear correlation between x - ray and radio luminosities .",
    "the observed rapid radio variability implies a low density environment , another disconnect between the spatial location of radio emitting structures and x - ray emitting structures , as inferred x - ray densities are much higher .    we can also constrain the size scales of x - ray and radio emission .",
    "since the observed x - ray luminosity is proportional to the volume emission measure ( vem ) , a function of the coronal electron density and size scale , for a spherically symmetric corona we have + @xmath78 where r@xmath79 is the stellar radius , which we take for ysos to be roughly 2 ( see discussion in  4.3 ) . using the observed x - ray luminosities and",
    "derived column emission measures in  4.3 , combined with coronal density estimates of n@xmath80 between 0.62.5 @xmath2010@xmath81 @xmath58 @xcite , implies size scales for the x - ray emission of @xmath82 between 0.002 and 2 , and thus relatively compact . for gyrosynchrotron emission appearing at the observed radio frequencies , valid for harmonics of the gyrofrequency @xmath83 for @xmath84 between 10 and 100 with @xmath85=2.8@xmath2010@xmath86b hz , the inferred magnetic field strengths in the region of radio emission are between 17 and 300 g.",
    "if we assume that this emission originates from a dipole field geometry , and the surface magnetic fields are in the range 13 kg @xcite , then the scale size of the radio emission @xmath87 is between 1.6 and 6 r@xmath79 .",
    "this shows that the radio emission appears to be physically distinct from the x - ray emission .",
    "this conclusion has also been reached by @xcite and @xcite for the case of hd  283447 .",
    "if there is a large - scale distribution of magnetic fields giving rise to the radio emission , the lack of circular polarization constrains the orientation of the emission to be largely edge - on , while a magnetic configuration composed of small - scale fields would also explain a null detection of circular polarization in radio emission .",
    "recent magnetic field measurements in tts show that strong and complex magnetic field geometries are present , which can potentially interfere with x - ray generation @xcite and probably radio generation as well .",
    "@xcite noted from modelling the x - ray emission of t tauri stars that more complex field geometries were associated with more compact , denser coronae .",
    "perhaps the complex field configuration and possible coupling of disk to star changes the emergent radiations associated with the magnetic fields in such a way as to break the @xmath88 relation and any variability correlations .",
    "we find that nonthermal radio emission ( based on flat / negative spectral indices ) can be produced even in stars with infrared evidence for disks .",
    "in fact , we see large - scale radio emission variability from one class  ii object ( [ bw88 ]  3 ) , as well as a possibly substellar object ( [ bw88 ]  1 ) . thus radio emission can be used as a diagnostic of magnetic activity in young stellar objects both with and without disks . using this observational tool , we find a variety of behaviors indicating a different kind of magnetic activity from that seen on active stars and the sun : anti - correlation between radio luminosity and radio spectral index , lack of expected correlation between radio and x - ray luminosities , lack of correlated variability between radio and x - ray emission , and anti - correlation between the ratio of radio to x - ray luminosity and x - ray luminosity . the anti - correlation between radio flux and spectral index points to a gyrosynchrotron emission mechanism which requires a different evolution of field strength , number density of accelerated electrons , and distribution compared to what is seen on nearby active stars and the sun .",
    "the multi - wavelength behaviors suggest a decoupling between particle acceleration and plasma heating , in both time - averaged and time - variable trends .",
    "the lack of expected correlation between radio and x - ray luminosities can be interpreted as due to their production in different magnetic regions , or out of different energy reservoirs .",
    "there are a few calculations which support the former : the different inferred electron densities for x - ray emitting material versus that required to explain the rapid variability of radio emission ( x - ray emission arising from denser regions ) ; the calculated optical depth to radio emission of the x - ray - emitting plasma ( showing that the x - ray emitting plasma would be optically thick and therefore not likely to escape and be detected at radio wavelengths ) ; and the lack of correspondence between estimated x - ray size scales and radio size scales , which suggest for simple configurations that the x - ray emission is more compact than the radio emission .",
    "the primary finding of our investigation is that the magnetic activity signatures ( radio , x - ray ) and their correlations from young stellar objects in the lkh@xmath0101 cluster show different trends from those established for nearby active stars .",
    "our results are new in that we probe a region of variability space occupied by few other multi - wavelength observations of young stellar objects : long - duration , multi - frequency radio coverage , with simultaneous multi - wavelength observations .",
    "we conclude that we are likely seeing evidence of a new phenomenon in these highly active young stars .",
    "our conclusions are tempered by the small number of objects in our analysis , which is a result of the asymmetry between percentages of radio and x - ray emission in cluster members .",
    "we are expanding our multi - wavelength investigation in magnetic activity from young stars with current and future observations of clusters spanning a range in ages .",
    "the simultaneous multi - wavelength coverage in this campaign was vital to establishing the disconnect between these magnetic activity signatures , and points out the parameter space available for future such studies .",
    "future observations with the expanded very large array ( evla ) , with roughly a factor of ten increase in sensitivity to radio emission , will be able to expand upon the findings presented here .",
