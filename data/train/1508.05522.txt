    "the medial axis of an object is a geometric structure that was introduced by blum @xcite as a means of providing a compact representation of a shape .",
    "initially defined as the set of the shock points of a grass fire lit on the boundary and allowed to propagate uniformly inside the object , closely related definitions of skeleton @xcite and cut - locus @xcite have since been proposed , and have served for the study of its topological properties @xcite , its stability @xcite and for the development of fast and efficient algorithms for its computation @xcite .",
    "applications of the medial axis are ample in scope and nature , ranging from computer vision to image analysis , from mesh generation to computer aided design .",
    "we refer to @xcite and the references therein for applications and accounts of some recent theoretical developments .",
    "an inherent drawback of the medial axis is , however , its sensitivity to boundary details , in the sense that small perturbations of the object ( with respect to the hausdorff distance ) can produce huge variations of the corresponding medial axis .",
    "this observation has prompted a large body of research that has roughly followed two lines , both aimed at the definition of some stable modification of the medial axis : one consists of reducing the complexity of the medial axis by pruning the less important parts of the domain @xcite , the other considers the definition of filter conditions that identify subsets of the medial axis which are stable to perturbations of the sets and retain some of its topological properties , for instance , homotopy equivalence with the object . within this second line of research",
    ", we mention , among others , the @xmath11medial axis introduced in @xcite , the @xmath12homotopy preserving medial axis introduced initially in @xcite and subsequently modified in @xcite to ensure the homotopy equivalence , and the power crust method @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-medial axis and the @xmath13-homotopy preserving medial axis are explicitly defined as subsets of the medial axis , being collections of those points of the medial axis that meet some geometrical criteria .",
    "such criteria are expressed in terms of a bound either on the distance to the boundary of the object or on the separation angle @xmath13 ( see definition [ sec3.def.opnang ] below ) , respectively .",
    "the power crust , in contrast , and also the algorithm discussed in @xcite , provide a continuous approximation of the medial axis constructed using a subset of the vertices , called poles , of the voronoi diagram of a finite point sample of the object boundary . in all such works , the stable modifications are sought by identifying directly points of the medial axis or of an approximation of it .",
    "the excellent survey paper @xcite contains a thorough discussion of such approaches and of the related stability issues .",
    "we adopt in this paper a fundamentally distinct strategy which , if compared with the works mentioned above , represents an indirect approach relying on the use of the compensated convex transforms @xcite .",
    "the theory of compensated convex transforms has been introduced and applied in the calculus of variations for finding the quasiconvex envelope of a function @xcite and for finding tight smooth approximations of the maximum function and the squared - distance function @xcite .",
    "compensated convex transforms , however , also provide a natural and stable global method to extract geometric singularities , such as ridges , valleys and edges , from a given function by manipulating its ` landscape ' @xcite , and it is in this way that the transforms , in particular the lower compensated convex transform ( hereafter , called also the lower transform ) , will be used in this paper .",
    "whether one applies the lower compensated convex transform or the upper compensated convex transform depends on the type of geometric singularities to be extracted .",
    "the works @xcite present a systematic study on the use of these basic transforms to extract singularities from the graph of functions in general , or from the characteristic functions of compact sets , whereas the patent application @xcite contains various applications including our method for extracting the multiscale medial axis map .",
    "the key properties that are exploited to highlight and/or to design a specific singularity are : the tight approximation of the compensated transforms , their regularity and the manner in which they respond to the type of curvature .",
    "more specifically , @xcite focuses on the basic use of these transforms to detect ridges , valleys and saddle points of graph of functions , whereas @xcite presents the design of a transform which is capable of filtering out the ` regular points ' and the ` regular directions ' on manifolds .",
    "the application of the lower transform to study the medial axis of a set is motivated fundamentally by the identification of the medial axis with the singularity set of the distance function ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 8.5.12 ) and by the geometric structure of this set @xcite . on the other hand , the distance function ,",
    "its regularity and its geometric structure , are well - studied both in geometric measure theory @xcite and in the theory of partial differential equations @xcite .",
    "if the set @xmath1 is a smooth compact submanifold of @xmath2 , there are many local regularity results of the distance function near @xmath1 @xcite , whereas , for a general bounded open set @xmath14 , some results by albano @xcite imply that the distance function @xmath15 is locally @xmath5 in @xmath16 in the sense that if @xmath17 , there is a @xmath18 such that @xmath19 .    in the following , however , it is more convenient to refer to the squared - distance function and use the identification of the singular set of the distance function with the set of points where the squared distance function fails to be locally @xmath5 .",
    "here , we just note that the advantage of referring to the squared distance function rather than to the distance function has also been realized in other contexts , such as , in the study of the motion of surfaces by its mean curvature represented by manifolds with codimension greater than one @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a detailed study on the properties of the squared distance function and on its applications in the geometric evolution problems .    using properties of the lower transform",
    ", we apply the lower compensated convex transform to the euclidean squared - distance function which gives a smooth @xmath20 ) tight approximation outside a neighbourhood of the closure of the medial axis ( see theorem [ sec3.thm.tghtapprx.eq1 ] ) , and define our multiscale medial axis map as a scaled difference between the squared - distance function and its lower transform . from the property of the tight approximation of the lower transform of the squared - distance function ,",
    "we also deduce a sharp @xmath5-regularity result ( see corollary [ sec3.cor.reg ] and example [ sec3.ex.shrpest ] ) of the squared - distance function outside a neighbourhood of the closure of the medial axis of @xmath1 , which can be viewed as a weak lusin type theorem for the squared - distance function and extend regularity results of the squared - distance function to any closed non - empty subset of @xmath2 .",
    "this result also offers an instance of application of the compensated convex transform to obtain a fine result of geometric measure theory and is , somehow , related to the behaviour of semiconcave functions ( see @xcite and remark [ sec2.rem.sem]@xmath21 below ) .",
    "we observe that , in general , the regularity of @xmath4 can not be better than @xmath5 even for a compact convex set @xmath1 where @xmath22 .",
    "a simple example is given by the square @xmath23\\times [ 0,1]\\subset \\mathbb{r}^2 $ ] .",
    "in this case , it can be easily verified that @xmath24 is globally @xmath5 but not @xmath25 .",
    "the application of the lower compensated convex transform of scale @xmath0 to the squared - distance function produces a continuous function in @xmath26 that remains strictly positive on the medial axis and tends to zero outside of it as a positive parameter @xmath0 becomes very large ( see proposition [ sec3.liminfsup ] ) .",
    "we will , in fact , characterize the limit of the multiscale medial axis map of scale @xmath0 as @xmath0 approaches to infinity ( see theorem [ sec3.teo.limmma ] ) and refer to this geometric structure as the quadratic multiscale medial axis landscape map of @xmath1 .",
    "the values of this map are well separated , in the sense that they are zero outside the medial axis and remain strictly positive on it .",
    "furthermore , we will give conditions ( see proposition [ sec3.pro.opang ] and section [ secex ] ) that ensure that the multiscale medial axis map of scale @xmath0 actually keeps a constant height along the parts of the medial axis generated by two - point subsets , with the value of the height dependent on the distance between the two generating points .",
    "such values can , therefore , be used to define a hierarchy between different parts of the medial axis and we can thus select the relevant parts through simple thresholding , that is , by taking suplevel sets of the multiscale medial axis map . to reflect this property , we use the word `` multiscale '' . for each branch of the medial axis , the multiscale medial axis map automatically defines a scale associated with it .",
    "in other words , a given branch has a strength which depends on some geometric features of the part of the set that generates that branch .    given a closed non - empty subset @xmath1 of @xmath2 , we will also prove that , despite the medial axis of @xmath1 not being hausdorff stable , the quadratic multiscale medial axis map , is indeed hausdorff stable ( see theorem [ sec4.teo.has ] ) .",
    "it follows that the graph of the medial axis map carries more information than the medial axis itself , which allows the definition of a hierarchy between the parts of the medial axis and the selection of the relevant ones through simple thresholding , that is , by taking suplevel sets of the medial axis map .",
    "in this manner , it is possible to choose the main parts that reflect genuine geometric features of the object and remove minor ones generated by noise .    in conclusion",
    ", we observe that while our method seems to share similarities with those based on the extraction of ridges of the distance transform @xcite , ( that require , however , an a - priori definition of ridge , based usually on an approximation of the derivative of the distance transform ) , the method we propose is , in fact , substantially different from such approaches , given that we obtain a neighbourhood of the singularities as the difference between the squared - distance transform and its smooth tight approximation . in this manner ,",
    "as mentioned above , we provide an indirect definition of the singularity , which does not require any derivative approximation or any differentiability assumption .    after this brief introduction",
    ", the next section will introduce the relevant notation and recall basic results in convex analysis and lower compensated convex transforms .",
    "section [ secmr ] contains the definition of the multiscale medial axis map , and some of its principal properties , such as the tight approximation of the lower compensated transform to the squared - distance transform ( see theorem [ sec3.thm.tghtapprx.eq1 ] ) and as an application , we deduce a sharp regularity result of the squared - distance function to any non - empty closed subset of @xmath2 ( see corollary [ sec3.cor.reg ] ) .",
    "section [ sechau ] presents the hausdorff stability of the multiscale medial axis map whereas section [ secex ] discusses some mathematical prototype models of explicitly calculated medial axis maps for a simple four point set to some more complicated three dimensional objects .",
    "finally , section [ secprf ] concludes the paper with the proofs of the main results .",

    "we use the notation @xmath50 to denote the derivative of @xmath51 .    across the current literature",
    ", there is no uniform definition of the medial axis , with its meaning changing from one author to another .",
    "what the medial axis is for one , becomes the skeleton for another , and in some cases subtle differences are present , especially in the continuum case , where the closure of such sets is considered . in this paper",
    "we adopt the definition given by lieutier in @xcite , but it is reformulated here to include a non - empty closed set @xmath52 with @xmath53 as well as a non - empty bounded open set @xmath14 .",

    "<S> in this paper we introduce a new stable mathematical model for locating and measuring the medial axis of geometric objects , called the _ quadratic multiscale medial axis map of scale @xmath0 _ , and provide a sharp regularity result for the squared - distance function to any closed non - empty subset @xmath1 of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> our results exploit properties of the function @xmath3 obtained by applying the quadratic lower compensated convex transform of parameter @xmath0 @xcite to @xmath4 , the euclidean squared - distance function to @xmath1 . using a quantitative estimate for the tight approximation of @xmath4 by @xmath3 , we prove the @xmath5-regularity of @xmath4 outside a neighbourhood of the closure of the medial axis @xmath6 of @xmath1 , which can be viewed as a weak lusin - type theorem for @xmath4 , and give an asymptotic expansion formula for @xmath3 in terms of the scaled squared distance transform to the set and to the convex hull of the set of points that realize the minimum distance to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the multiscale medial axis map , denoted by @xmath7 , is a family of non - negative functions , parametrized by @xmath8 , whose limit as @xmath9 exists and is called the multiscale medial axis landscape map , @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that @xmath10 is strictly positive on the medial axis @xmath6 and zero elsewhere . </S>",
    "<S> we give conditions that ensure @xmath7 keeps a constant height along the parts of @xmath6 generated by two - point subsets with the value of the height dependent on the scale of the distance between the generating points , thus providing a hierarchy of heights ( hence , the word multiscale ) between different parts of @xmath6 that enables subsets of @xmath6 to be selected by simple thresholding . </S>",
    "<S> asymptotically , further understanding of the multiscale effect is provided by our exact representation of @xmath10 . moreover , given a compact subset @xmath1 of @xmath2 , while it is well known that @xmath6 is not hausdorff stable , we prove that in contrast , @xmath7 is stable under the hausdorff distance , and deduce implications for the localization of the stable parts of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> explicitly calculated prototype examples of medial axis maps are also presented and used to illustrate the theoretical findings . </S>"
