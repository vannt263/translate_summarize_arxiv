    "quantum entanglement is one of the most fundamental and fascinating features of quantum mechanics .",
    "the most mysterious aspect of quantum entanglement would be to affect the outcome of local measurements instantaneously beyond the lightcone once a local measurement is performed .",
    "there are many phenomena in which quantum entanglement may play a role , including the bubble nucleation  @xcite .",
    "recent studies of the bubble nucleation problem infer that observer frames will be strongly correlated to each other when they observe the nucleation frame  @xcite .",
    "the entanglement entropy as a suitable measure of entanglement of a quantum system has been developed in condensed matter physics , quantum information and high energy physics .",
    "especially , the entanglement entropy has now been established as a useful tool in quantum field theory to characterize the nature of long range correlations .",
    "even so , however , the explicit calculation of the entanglement entropy in quantum field theories had not been an easy task until ryu and takayanagi proposed a method of calculating the entanglement entropy of a strongly coupled quantum field theory with its gravity dual using holographic techniques  @xcite .",
    "their formula has passed many consistency checks and proven to be extremely powerful  @xcite .",
    "following a great deal of attention paid to the success , maldacena and pimentel developed an explicit method to calculate the entanglement entropy in a quantum field theory in the bunch - davies vacuum of de sitter space and discussed the gravitational dual of this theory and its holographic interpretation  @xcite .",
    "the method is also extended to @xmath0-vacua in  @xcite    based on these developments that enable us to calculate long range correlations explicitly , it would be interesting to apply this to cosmology now .",
    "we expect that the entanglement could exist beyond the hubble horizon because de sitter expansion eventually separates off a pair of particles created within a causally connected , hubble horizon size region",
    ". it may be possible to investigate whether a universe entangled with our own universe exists within the multiverse framework .",
    "such a scenario may be observable through the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the effect of quantum entanglement on the spectrum of vacuum fluctuations in de sitter space by using a reduced density matrix in the open chart derived by maldacena and pimentel as a first step of application to cosmology .",
    "it is known that the inside of a nucleated bubble looks like an open universe  @xcite , so this formulation will be suitable for the multiverse framework and also for open inflation directly .",

    ", the reduced density matrix has to be diagonalized .",
    "the following is a review on the derivation of the reduced density matrix given in @xcite .    as we see in eq .",
    "( [ phit ] ) , the mode function @xmath55 corresponding to the bunch - davies vacuum is a linear combination of the legendre functions @xmath82 , which are proportional to the positive frequency modes in the past in each @xmath3 or @xmath4 region . setting @xmath83 ,",

    "we discretize the @xmath33-mode spectrum with a width @xmath109 and take the limit @xmath110 only at the end of computation .",
    "this means , for example , we rescale the operators @xmath104 as @xmath111 , where the index ` cont ' denotes the operator with the original , continuous spectrum , and the operators @xmath104 and @xmath112 appearing in eq .",

    "( [ gammap ] ) , we get @xmath149    now we have the density matrix which enables us to trace over the @xmath3 degrees of freedom easily . by using eqs .",
    "( [ bogoliubov2 ] ) and ( [ norm2 ] ) , the reduced density matrix is then found to be diagonalized as @xmath150 where we defined @xmath151 .",
    "note that this density matrix is for each mode labeled by @xmath53 .",
    "now we calculate the mean - square vacuum fluctuations by using the reduced density matrix obtained in eq .",
    "( [ dm ] ) .",
    "since we traced out the degrees of freedom of the @xmath3 region , the corresponding field operator has to be defined only in the @xmath4 region .",
    "also the field operator should act only on @xmath152 conforming with the reduced density matrix .",
    "then , the fourier mode field operator should be defined as @xmath153 where the calligraphic indices @xmath154 run from 1 to 2 , and the matrix is reduced to a @xmath155 form : latexmath:[\\ ] ] we are interested in the case of small mass ( @xmath210 ) .",
    "taking this limit , we see that the spectrum for @xmath179 decreases most slowly as @xmath174 .",
    "the spectra at long wavelengths are plotted in figure [ fig4 ] , where we take @xmath211 .",

    ", height=264 ]",
    "we investigated the spectrum of vacuum fluctuations with quantum entanglement in de sitter space by using the reduced density matrix obtained by maldacena and pimentel in  @xcite .",
    "we formulated the mean - square vacuum fluctuations by introducing the two open charts , @xmath4 and @xmath3 , which are entangled .",
    "we found that the effect of tracing out the degrees of freedom of the @xmath3 region comes in to the mean - square of vacuum fluctuations and enhances it on scales larger than the curvature radius . on the other hand , on small scales ,",
    "the spectrum of vacuum fluctuations of a massless scalar field is found to be scale invariant , and completely indistinguishable from the pure bunch - davies ( hence highly entangled ) case .",
    "we also considered a fictitious case in which we assume the @xmath4 region were the whole universe . in this case , with respect to a natural vacuum state defined in the @xmath4 region , the scale invariant spectrum is also realized on small scales .",
    "thus it turned out that we can not distinguish which state is valid for our universe among the entangled state ( @xmath55 ) , the mixed state from the entangled state ( @xmath179 ) and non - entangled state ( @xmath196 ) , as long as we focus on the spectrum on small scales .    on the other hand ,",
    "the spectrum for each of these three cases is found to be different from each other on large scales comparable to or greater than the curvature radius .",
    "we found that the spectra for the entangled and mixed states tend to be enhanced compared to the non - entangled state on scales comparable to the curvature radius .",
    "if we go further to scales much larger than the curvature radius , there appears a difference between the entangled state and mixed state .",
    "the spectrum for the mixed state is enhanced substantially relative to the entangled state .",
    "since we can use these differences to distinguish those three states , they seem to be relevant ( and hopefully observationally testable ) in the context of open inflation .    now let us consider why the difference appeared in the spectra between the entangled and mixed states .",
    "in general , if we consider two subsystems @xmath1 and @xmath2 that form a state @xmath215 , the expectation value of a physical quantity @xmath216 is expressed by using the density matrix @xmath217 as @xmath218 if @xmath216 depends only on @xmath1 , that is , @xmath219 : @xmath220 then eq .  ( [ general : ev2 ] ) becomes @xmath221 where @xmath222 thus , the expectation value @xmath223 is equal to @xmath224 if @xmath216 does not depend on @xmath2 . in other words , for an operator with the property @xmath225 , the expectation value should agree with each other .",
    "based on this general argument , we may understand the reason why the spectra for the entangled state and the mixed state from the entangled state become different on large scale @xmath226 .",
    "we see that the creation and anihilation operators @xmath227 include the operators on both sides , @xmath228 ( @xmath229 ) , as in eq .  ( [ ab ] ) .",
    "this means that the field operator @xmath230 naturally involves operators on both sides even if the time slice @xmath50 is restricted to the @xmath4 region . on the other hand , after tracing out the degrees of freedom of the @xmath3 region , the mixed state @xmath231 is described by the creation and anihilation operators defined only in the @xmath4 region .",
    "that is , the field operator @xmath232 is defined only in the @xmath4 region .",
    "thus apparently @xmath233 , implying that the above general argument does not hold because @xmath234 .",

    "another direction is to consider interactions .",
    "the formalism we developed in this paper is at tree level",

    "<S> we investigate the effect of entanglement between two causally separated open charts in de sitter space on the spectrum of vacuum fluctuations . we consider a free massive scalar field , and construct the reduced density matrix by tracing out the vacuum state for one of the open charts , as recently derived by maldacena and pimentel . </S>",
    "<S> we formulate the mean - square vacuum fluctuations by using the reduced density matrix and show that the scale invariant spectrum of massless scalar field is realized on small scales . on the other hand , we find that the quantum entanglement affects the shape of the spectrum on large scales comparable to or greater than the curvature radius .    </S>",
