    "in conservative media , light can propagate as a stable non - diverging beam due to a balance between diffraction ( dispersion ) and nonlinearity .",
    "such a localized wave with a bell - shaped intensity profile in the transverse direction corresponds to a soliton , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "solitons are investigated actively as important objects of nonlinear optics .",
    "another type of localized waves , namely , fronts ( shock waves , kinks , transition waves ) are studied less in optics @xcite .",
    "a front is a local variation of the field that connects two different uniform states @xcite .",
    "often , one state is stable , while the other is unstable ( metastable ) .",
    "then , the stable state expands into the unstable one , and the front corresponds to a transition region between the two states .",
    "the dynamics of fronts in dissipative media is a subject of extensive studies in physics  @xcite . an important model , that describe front propagation , is the nonlinear diffusion ( nd ) equation  @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the real - valued field ( e.g. pressure or concentration ) , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the spatial and evolutional ( time ) coordinates , respectively , @xmath4 is the diffusion coefficient , and @xmath5 is a nonlinear function .",
    "a well - known example of the nd equation is the fisher - kolmogorov equation  @xcite , where @xmath6 .",
    "the study of this equation , started in the first half of the twentieth century , has revealed the main properties of fronts in _ diffusive _ media .",
    "further development of the theory was connected , in particular , with the study of complex - valued fields and the combined effect of diffusion and _ dispersion_. the corresponding model can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a complex field , @xmath9 is a function of @xmath10 and it s derivatives , and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) characterizes dispersion ( diffusion ) . a well studied example of model  ( [ evol ] ) is the complex ginzburg - landau equation that describes pattern formation in a variety of physical systems  @xcite .",
    "typically , model  ( [ evol ] ) , as well as  ( [ nde ] ) , possesses a family of front solutions with different spatial distributions and velocities .",
    "however , many particular examples of the model demonstrate the following property .",
    "a wide class of initial conditions evolve into a well - defined front with a specific velocity @xmath13 .",
    "this velocity depends only on the parameters of the model .",
    "in other words , the system `` selects '' a particular front from a variety of all possible fronts .",
    "there are different approaches for calculation of the parameters of the selected front .",
    "the most developed approach is the theory of marginal stability ( ms ) that states the following  @xcite .",
    "let an evolutional equation in form  ( [ evol ] ) has a front solution .",
    "then the selected front velocity @xmath13 is found from the dispersion relation of the linearized eq .",
    "( [ evol ] ) , @xmath14 .",
    "namely  @xcite , @xmath15 where the complex wavenumber @xmath16 is obtained from @xmath17 the result  ( [ vstar ] ) is not proven rigorously , but it works for many types of evolutional equations .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze a limit of purely dispersive media without diffusion .",
    "this situation is typical in optics .",
    "we consider a beam propagation in media with linear gain and nonlinear losses ( two - photon absorption ) .",
    "such parameters are characteristic for laser systems .",
    "we demonstrate that at some conditions , the beam expansion in such media is related to the propagation of two fronts moving in opposite directions",
    ". then , the beam evolution can be restored , to some extent , from of the front parameters .",
    "unfortunately , the theory of ms is not useful for analysis of fronts in media with pure dispersion .",
    "we find that the front parameters in dispersive media depend not only on the the system parameters , but also on _ initial conditions _ , see sec .  [",
    "sec : sw ] .",
    "the optical beam dynamics in nonlinear media is described by the generalized nonlinear schrdinger equation  @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the envelope of the electric field , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the transverse and longitudinal coordinates , respectively , @xmath20 is the diffraction ( dispersion ) coefficient , @xmath21 is the kerr nonlinearity parameter , @xmath22 characterizes nonlinear absorption , and @xmath23 is the parameter of linear gain",
    ". equation  ( [ nlse ] ) can be normalized such that @xmath24 , therefore we use these values in all numerical simulations .",
    "one can distinguish two basic scenarios of the beam propagation in media with gain and losses , see fig .",
    "[ fig : bd ] .",
    "let us consider , for example , a case of low initial peak intensity .",
    "then , the peak intensity of the beam increases initially due to linear gain",
    ". this increase is limited by nonlinear dissipation .",
    "intensity near the beam center keeps at a constant value due to the balance between the two effects , while intensity at the beam edges continues to rise .",
    "this process results in a formation of two fronts moving in opposite directions , see fig .  [",
    "fig : bd](a ) .",
    "one can see that at large @xmath3 , fronts move with constant velocities as stationary waves .    in the second scenario , fig .",
    "[ fig : bd](b ) , the initial beam breaks up into several pulses that in turn generate new pulses and so on .",
    "then , a lattice of pulses is created . that non - uniform region expands into the unstable uniform one .",
    "in fact , a lattice of pulses is formed in the first scenario as well , see fig .",
    "[ fig : bd](a ) . the first ( second ) scenario is realized when the front velocity is larger ( smaller ) than that of the expansion of the lattice of pulses . in this paper",
    "we are focused mainly on the first scenario , where the asymptotic dynamics of the beam is determined by the front parameters .",
    "we provide also a condition that separates the two types of the dynamics , see sec .",

    "( [ nlse ] ) corresponds to a separatrix of dynamical system  ( [ ds ] ) . in particular , a pulse is described by a separatrix that connects two l - points , while a front is described by a separatrix that connects the l- and n - points .",
    "equation  ( [ form ] ) for stationary waves involves two unknown parameters , @xmath27 and @xmath26 . in general",

    "( [ nlse ] ) , we find a result which is not typical for dissipative systems . from our analysis",
    ", we conclude that the front velocity is defined also by initial conditions .",
    "this is in contrast to dissipative diffusive media , where @xmath26 depends mainly on the system parameters .",
    "there are no regular methods to obtain the front parameters for arbitrary initial conditions .",
    "let us consider a particular initial condition @xmath39 $ ] with the following asymptotic behavior for amplitude @xmath40 and phase @xmath41 : @xmath42 we find that a front developed from such initial conditions moves uniformly ( see fig .",

    "analysis of the eigenvalues of the l - points reveals that only a single trajectory goes out of plane @xmath45 from the l - point .",
    "it means that the l - l and l - n separatrices can not co - exist for a given set of the parameters .",
    "these facts indicate a presence of a _ global _",
    "bifurcation  @xcite in system  ( [ ds ] ) , and therefore in eq .",
    "( [ nlse ] ) .",
    "namely , depending on the parameters , the separatrix that starts from the l - point , ends at either the another l - point or the n - point as @xmath53 , depending on the parameters . at the same time , the local properties of model  ( [ ds ] ) , in particular , the types of the fixed points , do not change near the bifurcation .",

    "for other values of @xmath26 , the bifurcation value @xmath54 ( or @xmath68 ) can be calculated using the galilean invariance , @xmath69 .",

    "first , we analyze real initial conditions , i.e. without phase modulations .",
    "we find that the first scenario with well - defined fronts is realized , when the front velocity is larger than the threshold velocity @xmath72 .",
    "the threshold @xmath72 is the velocity of an expansion of the pulse region . the later , we believe , is related to the modulational instability of the plane wave with amplitude @xmath73 .",
