    "we set @xmath520 \\ ; \\textnormal { where } \\ ; \\hat{e } = \\left \\lbrace e \\in \\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{n } } e(g_n ) \\ ; ; \\ ; \\exists n \\in \\mathbb{n } : e \\in \\bigcap_{n \\geq n } e(g_n ) \\right \\rbrace .\\ ] ] note that an edge @xmath521 is an element of @xmath522 if and only if it was not deleted during the construction of @xmath513 as an edge incident with one of the vertices that correspond to @xmath329 or @xmath29 in @xmath518 for some @xmath410 .",
    "finally we define @xmath3 as the graph obtained from @xmath519 by identifying the three vertices that correspond to @xmath108 , @xmath453 and @xmath25 of @xmath523 .",
    "next let us verify that every vertex and every end of @xmath3 has degree or vertex- as well as edge - degree , respectively , @xmath27 .",
    "since every vertex of @xmath9 except @xmath108 , @xmath453 and @xmath25 has degree @xmath27 , the construction ensures that every vertex of @xmath3 has degree @xmath27 too . in order to analyse the end degrees",
    ", we have to make some observations first .",
    "the edges of @xmath3 that are adjacent to vertices corresponding to @xmath108 , @xmath453 and @xmath25 of any @xmath518 define a cut @xmath524 of @xmath3 .",
    "note that for any finite cut of a graph all rays in one end of the graph have tails that lie completely on one side of the cut .",
    "therefore , the construction of @xmath3 ensures that for every end @xmath28 of @xmath3 there exists a function @xmath525 with @xmath526 such that all rays in @xmath28 have tails in @xmath527 for each @xmath324 and @xmath528 with @xmath529 . using that @xmath530 for every @xmath531 and @xmath410",
    ", this implies that every end of @xmath3 has edge - degree at most @xmath27 .",
    "since there are three disjoint paths from @xmath532 to @xmath533 as well as to @xmath534 in  @xmath9 , we can also easily construct three disjoint rays along the cuts @xmath524 that belong to an arbitrary chosen end of @xmath3 .",
    "so every end of @xmath3 has vertex - degree @xmath27 . in total",
    "this yields that every end of @xmath3 has vertex- as well as edge - degree @xmath27 .",
    "it remains to prove that @xmath3 has precisely one hamilton circle .",
    "we begin by stating the edge set of the subgraph @xmath21 defining the hamilton circle @xmath70 of @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath535 consist of those edges of @xmath536 for every @xmath531 and @xmath410 that correspond to the fat edges of @xmath9 in the most right picture of figure  [ tutte_hcs ] .",
    "now consider any finite cut @xmath68 of  @xmath3 .",
    "the construction of @xmath3 yields that there exists an @xmath537 such that @xmath68 is already a cut of the graph obtained from @xmath510 by identifying the vertices corresponding to @xmath108 , @xmath453 and @xmath25 of @xmath538 for all  @xmath539 . using this observation",
    "we can easily see that every vertex of @xmath3 has degree @xmath2 in @xmath70 and that every finite cut is met at least twice , but always in an even number of edges of @xmath21 . by lemma  [ top_conn ]",
    "we get that @xmath70 is topologically and also arc - connected .",
    "therefore , every end of @xmath3 has edge - degree at least @xmath5 and at most  @xmath27 in  @xmath70 .",
    "together with theorem  [ cycspace ] this implies that every end of @xmath3 has edge - degree  @xmath2 in  @xmath70 .",
    "hence , lemma  [ circ ] tells us that @xmath70 is a circle , which is hamiltonian since it contains all vertices of @xmath3 .",
    "we finish the proof by showing that @xmath70 is the unique hamilton circle of @xmath3 .",
    "since every hamilton circle @xmath12 of @xmath3 hits each cut @xmath524 precisely twice , @xmath12 induces a path through @xmath9 that contains all vertices of @xmath9 except one out of the set @xmath532 . by lemma  [ hcs_in_t ]",
    "we know that such paths must contain the edge adjacent to @xmath108 .",
    "let us consider any @xmath518 in @xmath510 and let @xmath540 be the copy of @xmath9 whose vertices of degree  @xmath5 we have identified with the vertices corresponding to the neighbours of @xmath329 in @xmath518 during the construction of @xmath513 .",
    "the way we have identified the vertices implies that path induced by @xmath12 through @xmath518 must also use the edge adjacent to @xmath453 since the induced path in @xmath540 must use the edge adjacent to @xmath108 . with a similar argument",
    "we obtain that the induced path inside @xmath518 must use the edge corresponding to @xmath38 .",
    "we know from lemma  [ hcs_in_t ] that there is a unique hamilton path in @xmath452 that uses the edges  @xmath541 and @xmath38 , namely the one corresponding to the fat edges in the most right picture of figure  [ tutte_hcs ] .",
    "so the edges which must be contained in every hamilton circle are precisely those of @xmath21 .",
