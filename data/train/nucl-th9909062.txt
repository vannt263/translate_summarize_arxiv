    "one of the most important problems in contemporary nuclear physics and astrophysics is the determination of the properties of nuclear matter as functions of density , temperature and the neutron - proton composition .",
    "in fact , neutron - star matter at densities between @xmath0 and nuclear matter saturation density consists of neutron - rich nuclei immersed in a gas of neutrons . in  particular , understanding the transition crust - core in neutron stars is essential for explaining a number of properties of these stars  @xcite . to achieve this goal",
    ", one must study not only the ground and excited states of normal nuclei , but also nuclear states of high excitation and far from stability .",
    "recently , two of us studied droplet formation from the liquid - gas phase transition in cold  @xcite and hot  @xcite asymmetric nuclear matter in the context of the non - linear walecka model ( nlwm )  @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we employ the quark - meson - coupling ( qmc ) model , originally proposed by guichon  @xcite . in the qmc model ,",
    "the mean scalar",
    "@xmath1 and vector @xmath2 meson fields couple directly to the confined quarks inside the nucleon bags , instead to point - like nucleons as in walecka - type models  @xcite .",
    "the saturation of nuclear matter in this model is due to the density dependence of the effective @xmath3 coupling , generated by the coupling of the mean @xmath1 field to the quarks .",
    "as we shall show in this paper , this density dependence of the coupling has important consequences for the phase - transition and for the droplet radius and surface energy density . while the qmc model shares many similarities with walecka - type models  @xcite , it however offers new opportunities for studying nuclear matter properties .",
    "perhaps one of the most exciting ones is the possibility of using the same model to study nuclear phenomena in a large range of densities . with the qmc model",
    ", we have the opportunity to investigate the density regime where the quarks remain confined in the nucleon bags , but the stucture of the nucleons nevertheless changes , as became evident from the emc effect  @xcite .",
    "we also expect to use the qmc model at much higher densities , where the nucleon bags start loosing their identity and the deconfinement transition starts taking place  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to explore the performance of the model in all such density regimes .",
    "another good reason to use the qmc model in the confined regime is that it might be of help to fix the low - energy constants of relativistic lagrangians , where nucleon substructure is incorporated through a derivative expansion  @xcite .    since the original version of the model ,",
    "there have been several ameliorations and extensions .",
    "these include the treatment of the nucleon center - of - mass motion  @xcite , treatment of finite nuclei  @xcite , change of the bag constant in medium  @xcite , inclusion of finite temperature effects  @xcite and the treatment of fock  @xcite and quark - exchange  @xcite terms . for a list of applications of the model to a variety of nuclear phenomena and earlier studies within the qmc model ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .    within the framework of relativistic models ,",
    "the liquid - gas phase transition in nuclear matter has been investigated at zero and finite temperatures for symmetric and asymmetric semi - infinite systems  @xcite and for finite systems @xcite .",
    "the present study aims to study the liquid - gas phase transition and droplet formation in a vapor system at zero temperature in the context of the qmc model and explore differences from the results of refs .  @xcite .",
    "we include the coulomb interaction and work in the thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "we determine the conditions for phase coexistence in a binary system by building the binodal section of the qmc model at zero temperature . as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the optimal nuclear size of a droplet in a neutron gas is determined by a delicate balance between nuclear coulomb and surface energies .",
    "the surface energy favors nuclei with a large number of nucleons @xmath4 , while the nuclear coulomb self - energy favors small nuclei .",
    "however , because of the density dependence of the effective @xmath5 coupling in the qmc model , the critical pressure and proton fraction of the phase transition and the droplet properties turn out to be significantly different from the nl1 parametrization of the nlwm@xcite . we have chosen to compare the qmc model results with the ones obtained with the nl1 parametrization because this parametrization has proven to give an excellent reproduction of the ground - state properties of the nuclei in general  @xcite .",
    "the values calculated for the qmc model are also parameter dependent , but other possible parametrizations produce the same qualitative features as the one chosen in this work .",
    "we also see that , as expected , the presence of the outside neutron gas reduces the surface tension , since as the density of the system increases , the inside and outside matter become more and more alike .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "ii we briefly summarize the qmc model for finite asymmetric systems including the couplings of the @xmath6 meson and the photon to the quarks . in sect .",
    "iii we discuss the thomas - fermi approximation and in sect .",
    "iv we apply the model to asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "finally in sects .",
    "v and vi we give our numerical results and conclusions .",
    "in a nucleus , the motion of the nucleon is relatively slow and the quarks are highly relativistic .",
    "the internal structure of the nucleon has therefore enough time to adjust to the external local meson fields , the motion of the nucleon can be treated as a point - like dirac particle  @xcite with an effective mass @xmath7 .",
    "the effective mass depends on the position only through the mean scalar field @xmath1 . to describe a finite system with different numbers of protons and neutrons , it is necessary to consider also the contribution of the @xmath6 meson .",
    "besides , any realistic treatment of nuclear structure also requires that one introduces the coulomb force .",

    "the results are shown in fig .  3 and table  i. the solid and dashed lines in fig .",
    "3 show the results for qmc and nl1 , respectively .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the qmc result shows higher central density and smaller proton radius .",
    "this feature is present in all solutions we have obtained . in average the central density",
    "is @xmath89 @xmath72 higher in the qmc model .    in table",
    "i we give the central density , the surface energy density , the surface thickness and the proton radius of the droplet , as well as some properties of the models used , namely the incompressibility , efective nucleon mass and the scalar meson mass .",
    "the surface thickness , @xmath90 , is defined as the width of the region where the density drops from @xmath91 to @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the baryonic density at @xmath94 , after subtracting the background gas density . from table",
    "i it is seen that the qmc surface energy density is higher and the surface thickness smaller .",
    "in fact , as a common trend in all our solutions , the surface thickness is @xmath95 fm lower in the qmc model .",
    "this , in part , can be explained by the different values of the incompressibility @xmath96 , of the models  @xcite .",
    "intuitively , the higher the value of @xmath96 , the sharper the surface and more similar to a theta function the density distribution becomes .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite and also verified in  @xcite , this is not always the case when non - linear couplings are used .",
    "we should stress that the surface properties depend strongly not only on @xmath96 but also on @xmath97 and the effective mass @xmath98 as shown in  @xcite .",
    "in fact a smaller value of @xmath97 corresponds to a larger range of the attractive interaction , and thus an increase of the surface extension .    in fig .",
    "4 we show the surface energy density for a droplet with total particle number @xmath99 , with ( dashed line ) and without ( solid line ) the electromagnetic field . for comparison we also show in this figure the result ( without the coulomb field ) for the nl1 ( dotted line ) . as we can see , the differences resulting from different models are much larger than the differences due to the inclusion of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the density surface energy increases with the central proton fraction .",
    "in fact for small proton fraction , the matter inside the droplet becomes more and more neutron rich and , at the same time , the density difference between the matter inside and outside the droplet becomes smaller . were the matter inside and outside the same ,",
    "of course there would be no surface energy .",
    "this effect was already observed in earlier studies of neutron star matter  @xcite . comparing the qmc and nl1 results",
    ", we see that the density surface energy in the latter is smaller , in part due to its lower incompressibility , as discussed before .",
    "we also see that the coulomb field , a long range force , does not change much the density surface energy of the droplet , as expected .    in fig .",
    "5 we show the density surface energy for droplets with @xmath100 ( dashed line ) and @xmath87 ( solid line ) , both with the inclusion of the electromagnetic field , as a function of the central proton fraction .",
    "we see that the density surface energy increases with the total number of particles in the droplet .",
    "this is because the systems we studied , with @xmath100 , are not big enough and , therefore , @xmath101 depends on @xmath102 , the size of the droplet . in general @xmath101",
    "is identified with the surface energy density associated with an infinite plane surface with a finite thickness , with the matter on one side being in the liquid phase and on the other in the gas phase .",
    "we have checked that the density surface energy _ does not _ change appreciably in going from systems with @xmath87 to @xmath103 .",
    "it should be stressed that when the coulomb field is present the solution @xmath104 does not exist in our formalism , since the coulomb field favors an increase of the neutron fraction .    in fig .",
    "6 we show the proton radius as a function of the central proton fraction for the qmc model with ( dashed line ) and without ( solid line ) the contribution of the coulomb field , and for the nl1 without the coulomb field ( dotted line ) for a droplet with @xmath100 . as the equation of state of the nl1 model is softer than the qmc , the proton radius is larger in the former .",
    "it is interesting to notice that for @xmath105 in the interval ( @xmath106 ) , @xmath107 has a minimum .",
    "this is due to a competition between the repulsive coulomb force between protons and the attractive force between protons and neutrons .",
    "of course the inclusion of the coulomb field increases the proton radius ( due to repulsion ) .",
    "the fact that for small values of the liquid proton fraction , @xmath107 is smaller when the coulomb field is included is because for these droplets the total proton fraction in the droplet is in fact smaller than the total proton fraction in the droplet without the coulomb field , as can be seen in fig .  7 where we plot the total proton fraction in the droplet ( @xmath108 ) as a function of the central proton fraction in the system .    finally , in fig .",
    "8 we show the neutron skin thickness as a function of the central proton fraction for a droplet with @xmath100 for the qmc model with ( dashed line ) and without ( solid line ) the contribution of the coulomb field , and for the nl1 model without the coulomb field ( dotted line ) .",
    "we see that the behavior is very similar in both models , the neutron skin being thicker in the latter because of its softer surface .",
    "we also see that the contribution of the coulomb field decreases the neutron skin thickness , since the proton radius @xmath107 increases .",
    "it is worth pointing out that no results were shown for very small proton fractions because , for the desired total number of particles ( 20 and 40 ) we did not abtain convergence for the coupled differential equations .",
    "in fact , for small proton fractions , when the coulomb field is switched off we obtain convergence for sufficiently large droplets .",
    "as soon as we switch on the coulomb field the binding energy decreases and no solutions appear whatever the size of the droplet .",
    "this occurs in the qmc model , with respect to the nl1 , for smaller proton fractions .",
    "in this work we have studied , within the framework of the qmc model , the properties of droplets which arise from the liquid - gas phase transition under conditions predetermined by the binodal section .",
    "the droplets are described using the thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "the results are then compared with the nl1 .",
    "some of the consequences of the electromagnetic field in the droplet formation within the qmc model , for a fixed number of particles , is to slightly increase the surface energy density and to decrease the central density , increase the proton radius and decrease the neutron skin thickness except for very small proton fractions or for almost symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "nevertheless , the effect of the electromagnetic field is small in surface properties and the differences resulting from the use of different models are by far more important .",
    "the most important effect of the electromagnetic field is , however , to prohibit the existence of droplets with a very small percentage of protons , as well as very large droplets .",
    "we have seen that the implicit density dependence of the couplings in the qmc model has important consequences for the liquid - gas phase transition and the properties of the droplets .",
    "this , together with the different incompressibilities of the models affect sensibly the surface properties of the droplets .",
    "in particular , the qmc model predicts a higher density surface energy , a smaller proton radius and a smaller neutron skin thickness for the droplets than the corresponding predictions in the nl1 .",
    "we also note that while our numerical results depend on the particular model chosen ( namely , the qmc or nl1 models ) , some qualitative features such as the increase of the surface energy density , the increase of the total proton fraction and the decrease of the neutron skin thickness with the central proton fraction in the droplet , apply to both models .",
    "the inclusion of finite temperature effects in droplet formation within the qmc model is a natural extension of our calculation and work in this direction is under consideration .",
    "we also plan to investigate the effects of exchange terms for both the phase transition and the droplet properties .",
