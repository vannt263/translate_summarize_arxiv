    "supersymmetry ( susy ) provides the most natural solution to the gauge hierarchy problem in the standard model ( sm ) . in supersymmetric sms ( ssms ) with @xmath0 parity",
    ", the gauge couplings for @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 gauge symmetries are unified at about @xmath4  gev  @xcite , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) like neutralino can be cold dark matter candidate  @xcite , and the electroweak precision constraints can be evaded , etc .",
    "especially , gauge coupling unification  @xcite strongly suggests grand unified theories ( guts ) , which can explain the quantum numbers of the sm fermions and charge quantization elegantly .",
    "thus , the ssms are the most promising new physics beyond the sm .",
    "however , the recent lhc searches for supersymmetry  @xcite and higgs boson  @xcite have considerably shrinken the viable parameter spaces .",
    "thus , to explore the phenomenologically inspired ssms , we briefly review the phenomenological constraints in the following :    * the colored supersymmetric particles ( sparticles ) such as squarks and gluinos ( at least the first two generation squarks ) must have masses around the 1 tev or larger from the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite collaborations at the lhc . *",
    "the atlas and cms collaborations have reported an excess of events for the sm - like higgs boson with mass around @xmath5  gev and @xmath6  gev , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding global significances are respectively @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and the corresponding local significances without taking into account the look - elsewhere - effect ( lee ) are @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the viable light higgs boson mass range at the @xmath11 cl is from 115.5  gev to 127  gev  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the higgs boson mass around 125 gev gives very strong constraints on the viable supersymmetry parameter space , which have been studied extensively recently  @xcite . especially , the squark and/or gluino masses will be about a few tev in general in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) and the next to the mssm ( nmssm ) with simple supersymmetry mediation mechanisms .",
    "* the cold dark matter relic density is @xmath12 from the seven - year wmap measurements  @xcite .",
    "* the spin - independent elastic dark matter - nucleon scattering cross - sections are smaller than about @xmath13 for the dark matter mass around 50  gev  @xcite . * the experimental limit on the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) process , @xmath14 .",
    "the results from the heavy flavor averaging group ( hfag )  @xcite , in addition to the babar , belle , and cleo results , are : @xmath15 .",
    "there is also a theoretical estimate in the sm  @xcite of @xmath16 .",
    "the limits , where the experimental and theoretical errors are added in quadrature , are @xmath17 . * the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xmath18 .",
    "the experimental value of the muon @xmath18 deviates from the sm prediction by about @xmath19 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath20  @xcite . * the experimental limit on the process @xmath21 .",
    "the upper bound on @xmath22 is @xmath23 from the cms and lhcb collaborations  @xcite . *",
    "the experimental limit on the process @xmath24 is @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "in addition , from the theoretical point of view , we usually have the family universal squark and slepton soft masses in the string model building , for example , the heterotic @xmath26 string theory with calabi - yau compactifications  @xcite , the intersecting d - brane model building  @xcite , and the f - theory model building  @xcite , etc .",
    "therefore , based on the above phenomenological constraints and theoretical considerations , we propose the electroweak supersymmetry around the electroweak scale : _ the squarks and/or gluinos are around a few tev while the sleptons , sneutrinos , bino and winos are within one tev . _",
    "the higgsinos ( or say the higgs bilinear @xmath27 term ) can be either heavy or light .",
    "we emphasize that gluinos can be within one tev because squarks are heavy .",
    "therefore , the constraints from the current atlas and cms supersymmetry and higgs searches and the @xmath14 , @xmath21 , and @xmath24 processes can be satisfied automatically due to the heavy squarks .",
    "also , the dimension - five proton decays in supersymmetric guts can be relaxed as well . moreover , the @xmath18 experimental result can be explained due to the light sleptons .",
    "also , we will assume that the dominant component of the lsp neutralino is bino .",
    "interestingly , the observed dark matter relic density can be realized via the lsp neutralino and light stau coannihilations , and the xenon experiment  @xcite will not give any constraint on such viable parameter spaces due to the heavy squarks .",
    "for simplicity , we will call the _ electroweak supersymmetry around the electroweak scale _ as the _ electroweak supersymmetry_.    in this paper , we consider the simple generalized minimal supergravity ( gmsugra )  @xcite ( for previous studies on non - universal gaugino masses in the supersymmetric guts , see refs .",
    "@xcite . ) .",
    "we show explicitly that the electroweak supersymmetry can be realized naturally , and gauge coupling unification can be preserved .",
    "to be concrete , we consider two scenarios for the gaugino mass ratios : scenario i has @xmath28 and scenario ii has @xmath29 , where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are bino mass , wino mass , and gluino mass , respectively .",
    "we discuss two cases for the supersymmetry breaking scalar masses and trilinear soft @xmath33 terms : ( a ) the universal scalar mass @xmath34 , and universal / non - universal trilinear @xmath33 terms .",
    "this case is similar to the msugra / cmssm ; ( b ) the universal squark and slepton mass @xmath34 , universal / non - universal trilinear @xmath33 terms , and especially non - universal higgs scalar masses .",
    "this case is similar to the nuhm2 . choosing a moderate @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the ratio of the higgs vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) in the ssms , we scan the viable parameter spaces which satisfy all the current phenomenological constraints .",
    "also , we present the concrete benchmark points where the squarks , gluinos and higgsinos are about a few tev while the sleptons , bino and winos are several hundreds of gev . for the universal trilinear soft @xmath33 term , we can fit all the experimental constraints very well except the @xmath37 . and",
    "the deviations of @xmath37 from the central value is about 2.6@xmath38 .",
    "interestingly , with non - universal trilinear soft @xmath33 terms , we can fit all the experimental constraints very well , especially , the deviations of @xmath37 from the central value is within 1 or 2@xmath38 .",
    "moreover , we comment on the fine - tuningg problem as well as the lhc searches .",
    "first , we explain our conventions . in ssms , we denote the left - handed quark doublets , right - handed up - type quarks , right - handed down - type quarks , left - handed lepton doublets , right - handed neutrinos and right - handed charged leptons as @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , respectively . also , we denote one pair of higgs doublets as @xmath45 and @xmath46 , which give masses to the up - type quarks / neutrinos and the down - type quarks / charged leptons , respectively .",
    "we consider the simple gmsugra where the gut group is @xmath47 and the higgs field is in the @xmath47 adjoint representation  @xcite .",
    "the gauge coupling relation and gaugino mass relation at the gut scale are the following  @xcite @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the index of these relations and is equal to @xmath51 .",
    "such gauge coupling relation and gaugino mass relation at the gut scale can be realized in the f - theory @xmath47 models where the gauge symmetry is broken down to the sm gauge symmetry by turning on the @xmath3 flux , and the f - theory @xmath52 models where the gauge symmetry is broken down to the @xmath53 gauge symmetry by turning on the @xmath54 flux  @xcite .    at the gut scale , we assume @xmath55 for simplicity , and then the gaugino mass relation becomes @xmath56 so there are two free parameters in gaugino masses .",
    "to realize the electroweak supersymmetry , we require that @xmath32 be larger than @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in the next section",
    ", we shall consider the following two simple scenarios for gaugino masses at the gut scale @xmath57 @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the normalized gaugino mass scale .",
    "thus , the gluino mass will be much larger than the bino and wino masses at low energy .",
    "in addition , the supersymmetry breaking scalar masses at the gut scale are  @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 is generation index , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are coupling constants , and @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the scalar masses related to the universal and non - universal parts , respectively . especially , the squark masses can be much larger than the slepton masses since the cancellations between the two terms in the slepton masses @xmath68 and @xmath69 can be realized by fine - tuning respectively @xmath62 and @xmath63 a little bit .",
    "also , the supersymmetry breaking soft masses @xmath70 and @xmath71 can be free parameters as well .",
    "interestingly , we can derive the scalar mass relations at the gut scale @xmath72 choosing slepton masses as input parameters , we can parametrize the squark masses as follows @xmath73 in short , the squark masses can be parametrized by the slepton masses and the universal scalar mass .",
    "if the slepton masses are much smaller than the universal scalar mass , we obtain @xmath74 .",
    "moreover , we can calculate the supersymmetry breaking trilinear soft @xmath33 terms @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 respectively for the sm fermion yukawa superpotential terms of the up - type quarks , down - type quarks , and charged leptons  @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are coupling constants , and @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the corresponding trilinear soft @xmath33 terms related to the universal and non - universal parts , respectively .",
    "therefore , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 can be free parameters in general in the gmsugra .    in short , we can parametrize the generic supersymmetry breaking soft mass terms in our simple gmsugra as following : two parameters in the gaugino masses , three parameters for the squark and slepton soft masses , three parameters in the trilinear soft a terms , and two parameters for the higgs soft masses .",
    "we propose the electroweak supersymmetry : _ the squarks and/or glunios are heavy around a few tev while the sleptons , bino and winos are light and within one tev_. the higgsinos ( or @xmath27 term ) can be either heavy or light . thus ,",
    "both the gaugino masses @xmath30 and @xmath31 and the slepton / sneutrino soft masses are smaller than one tev . also , there are three cases for the gaugino mass @xmath32 and squark soft masses : ( 1 ) @xmath32 is about a few tev while the squark soft masses are small ; ( 2 ) @xmath32 is small while the squark soft masses are about a few tev ; ( 3 ) both @xmath32 and squark soft masses are heavy . in this paper , for simplicity , we only consider the first case .",
    "the comprehensive study will be presented elsewhere .",
    "interestingly , we can show that the gauge coupling unification can be preserved in the electroweak supersymmetry even if the squarks and/or gluinos are about one or two orders heavier than the sleptons , bino and winos .",
    "the point is that the gauge coupling relation at the gut scale is given by eq .",
    "( [ gcrelation ] ) .",
    "the worst case is that the higgsinos are light while the gluinos are heavy .",
    "so we discuss it as an example . for simplicity , we assume that the masses for the sleptons , bino , winos and higgsinos are universersal , and the masses for the squarks and gluinos are universal . to prove the gauge coupling unification ,",
    "we only need to calculate the one - loop beta functions for the renormalization scale from the slepton mass to the squark mass . the one - loop beta functions @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 respectively for @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 are @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 . because @xmath90 is larger than @xmath91 , the gauge coupling relation at the gut scale in eq .",
    "( [ gcrelation ] ) can be realized properly .",
    "especially , the discrepancies among the sm gauge couplings at the gut scale are less than a few percents  @xcite .",
    "let us briefly comment on the fine - tuning problem on electroweak gauge symmetry breaking in the ssms .",
    "the radiative electroweak gauge symmetry breaking gives the minimization condition at tree level @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the @xmath94 boson mass .",
    "for the moderate and large values of @xmath36 , this condition can be simplified to @xmath95 the electroweak - scale @xmath96 depends on the gut - scale supersymmetry breaking soft terms such as gaugino masses , scalar masses , and trilinear soft @xmath33 terms , etc , via the renormalization group equation ( rge ) running .",
    "thus , if the squarks / gluinos are heavy and @xmath33 terms are large , the low energy @xmath96 will be large as well .",
    "and then we need to fine - tune the large @xmath27 term to realize the correct electroweak gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "such fine - tuning problem does exist in electroweak supersymmetry , and one of the solution is to employ the idea of focus point / hyperbolic branch supersymmetry  @xcite , which will be studied elsewhere .",
    "is not a lsp .",
    "the dark khaki region , khaki region and light grey region are excluded by the @xmath37 constraint , the cold dark matter relic density , and the lep constraints , respectively . ]",
    "is not a lsp .",
    "the yellow region , grey region and light grey region are excluded by the @xmath37 constraint , the cold dark matter relic density , and the lep constraints , respectively . ]",
    "we study two scenarios for gaugino masses , as given in eqs .",
    "( [ scenario - i ] ) and ( [ scenario - ii ] ) . for simplicity",
    ", we will consider two cases for the scalar masses and trilinear soft @xmath33 terms : ( a ) the unversal scalar mass @xmath34 and universal / non - universal trilinear soft @xmath33 terms .",
    "this case is similar to the msugra .",
    "( b ) the universal squark and slepton soft mass @xmath34 and universal / non - universal trilinear soft @xmath33 terms while the non - universal higgs soft masses .",
    "this case is similar to the nuhm2 .",
    "therefore , we will study four kinds of scenarios : scenario ia , scenario ib , scenario iia , and scenario iib .    in our numerical study , we will use the suspect program  @xcite to calculate the supersymmetric particle spectra , and use the micromegas program  @xcite to calculate the phenomenological constraints , the lsp neutralino relic density , and the direct detection cross - sections .",
    "we will focus on the lightest cp - even higgs boson mass from 123  gev to 127  gev in the numerical results , and choose the benchmark points with higgs boson mass only from 125.0 gev to 126.0 gev .",
    "the current top quark mass @xmath97 is @xmath98  gev  @xcite . because the lightest cp - even higgs boson mass is sensitive to the top quark mass , we take the upper bound @xmath99  gev in our numerical study .",
    "we emphasize that the viable parameter spaces with higgs boson mass larger than 127  gev in the following discussions are still fine since we can choose a smaller value for top quark mass within its uncertainty .",
    "we employ the following experimental constraints : ( 1 ) the cold dark matter relic density is @xmath100 ; ( 2 ) the @xmath14 branch ratio is @xmath101 ; ( 3 ) the @xmath102 @xmath18 constraint is @xmath103 ; ( 4 ) the upper bound on @xmath22 is @xmath23 ; ( 5 ) the experimental limit on the process @xmath24 is @xmath25 ; ( 6 ) the lep low bound on the lightest cp - even higgs boson mass is @xmath104 gev  @xcite , which is close to the current low bound 115.5  gev from atlas collaboration  @xcite . in our electroweak supersymmetry , the dominant component of the lsp neutralino will be bino , thus , the constaints from the xenon100 experiment  @xcite can be evaded automatically due to the heavy squarks .",
    "first , let us discuss the scenario i. to scan the viable parameter spaces in the @xmath105 plane , we consider the universal trilinear soft @xmath33 term @xmath106 , and we choose @xmath107 and @xmath108  gev .",
    "we present the viable parameter space in scenarios ia and ib respectively in fig .",
    "[ fig - sia1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig - sib1 ] .",
    "we emphasize again that the viable parameter spaces with higgs boson mass larger than 127  gev in all the figures are still fine because we can choose the smaller value for top quark mass within its uncertainty .",
    "it is easy to understand that scenario ib has larger viable parameter spaces since the higgs scalar masses are hidden variables in fig .",
    "[ fig - sib1 ] .",
    "interestingly , in scenario ia , we find the narrow viable range for @xmath34 , which is about from 410  gev to 440  gev .",
    "this narrow @xmath34 range is obtained in the electroweak supersymmetry since the observed dark matter relic density is realized from the lsp neutralino - stau coannihilations .",

    "the squarks , gluinos , and higgsinos are heavy while the sleptons , bino and winos are light .",
    "thus , the electroweak supersymmetry is realized .",
    "similar results are held for all the following benchmark points in this paper . in particular , the lsp neutralino has @xmath109 bino component due to the heavy higgsinos . however , the deviations of @xmath37 from the central value are about 2.88@xmath38 and 2.63@xmath38 for the benchmark points respectively in tables  [ tab : sia1 ] and [ tab : sib1 ] .",

    "<S> inspired by the phenomenological constraints , lhc supersymmetry and higgs searches , dark matter search as well as string model building , we propose the electroweak supersymmetry around the electroweak scale : the squarks and/or gluinos are around a few tev while the sleptons , sneutrinos , bino and winos are within one tev . </S>",
    "<S> the higgsinos can be either heavy or light . </S>",
    "<S> we consider bino as the dominant component of dark matter candidate , and the observed dark matter relic density is achieved via the neutralino - stau coannihilations . considering the generalized minimal supergravity ( gmsugra ) , we show explicitly that the electroweak supersymmetry can be realized , and the gauge coupling unification can be preserved . </S>",
    "<S> with two scenarios , we study the viable parameter spaces that satisfy all the current phenomenological constraints , and we present the concrete benchmark points . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we comment on the fine - tuning problem and lhc searches . </S>"
