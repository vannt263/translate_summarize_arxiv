    "population genetics is concerned with the investigation of the genetic structure of populations , which is influenced by evolutionary factors such as mutation , selection , recombination , migration and genetic drift . for excellent reviews of the theoretical aspects of this field ,",

    "the antagonistic interplay of mutation and selection shall be investigated , with mutation generating the genetic variation upon which selection can act .",
    "pure mutation ",
    "selection models exclude genetic drift and are therefore deterministic models , and accurate only in the limit of an infinite population size ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "a further simplification taken here is to consider only _ haploid _ populations , where the genetic material exists in one copy only in each cell .",
    "however , the equations used here to describe evolution apply as well to diploid populations without dominance .    for the modelling of the types considered , the _ sequence space approach _",
    "is used , which has first been used by @xcite to model the structure of the dna , where individuals are taken to be sequences . here",
    ", the sequences shall be written in a two - letter alphabet , thus simplifying the full four - letter structure of dna sequences . in this approach",
    ", the modelling is based on the microscopic level , at which the mutations occur , hence the mutation process is fairly straightforward to model .",
    "however , the modelling of selection is a more challenging task , as selection acts on the phenotype , and the mapping from genotype to phenotype is by no means simple . to this end , the concept of the _ fitness landscape _",
    "@xcite is introduced as a function on the sequence space , assigning to each possible genotype a fitness value which determines the reproduction rate .",
    "apart from the problem that a realistic fitness landscape would have to be highly complex ( too complex for a mathematical treatment ) , there is also very limited information available concerning the nature of realistic fitness functions .",
    "therefore , the modelling of fitness is bound by feasibility , trying to mimic general features that are thought to be essential for realistic fitness landscapes such as the degree of ruggedness .",
    "a very common type of fitness functions is the class of permutation - invariant fitness functions , where the fitness of a sequence is determined by the number of mutations it carries compared to the wild - type , but not on the locations of the mutations within the sequence .",
    "although this model describes the accumulation of small mutational effects surprisingly well , it is a simplistic model that lacks a certain degree of ruggedness that is thought to be an important feature of realistic fitness landscapes @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "hopfield - type fitness functions @xcite are treated as a more complex model . here , the fitness of a sequence is not only determined by the number of mutations compared to one reference sequence , but to a number of predefined sequences , the _ patterns_. this yields a class of fitness landscapes that contain a higher degree of ruggedness , which can be tuned by the number of patterns chosen .",
    "while this can still be treated with the methods used here , it is a definite improvement on the restriction of permutation - invariant fitness functions .",
    "particular interest is taken in the phenomenon of mutation driven error thresholds , where the population in equilibrium changes from viable to non - viable within a narrow regime of mutation rates . in this paper , a few examples of hopfield - type fitness functions are investigated with respect to the error threshold phenomenon .",

    "a necessary condition for the function @xmath208 to have a maximum at a value @xmath205 is that its derivatives at this @xmath205 vanish , @xmath210_{{\\boldsymbol{x}}={\\boldsymbol{x}}^ * } = 0   \\quad\\forall\\ , v , k \\;.\\ ] ] the global maximum of the function @xmath208 must lie on one of the points @xmath205 that fulfil equation ( [ error threshold general method ] ) or on the border of the mutational distance space .",
    "thus by comparing the values of @xmath208 on these possible points , the global maximum can be identified .    apart from the general possibility to investigate the dependence of the population mean fitness @xmath20 on the mutation rate @xmath47 , this yields the opportunity to investigate the phenomenon of the _ error threshold _ , which has interested scientists ever since it was first conceived by @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of the error threshold can be described as the existence of a critical mutation rate , below which the equilibrium population is well localised in sequence space , whereas for mutation rates above the critical mutation rate , the equilibrium population is more delocalised , with a sharp transition between the two phases .",
    "one problem is that there is no generally accepted definition of an error threshold .",
    "the criterion used in the original quasispecies model @xcite is the disappearance of the wild - type from the population , which under the single peaked landscape used there goes in line with the complete delocalisation of the population in sequence space .",
    "however , these two effects do not necessarily coincide for other fitness landscapes .",
    "the definition of the error threshold that shall be used here is equivalent to the definition of a phase transition in physics , differentiating between first and second order transitions as follows :    * definition ( first and second order error threshold ) . * + ( i ) a first order error threshold exists at a critical mutation rate @xmath211 , if the ancestral mean mutational distance as a function of the mutation rate @xmath212 shows a discontinuity at this @xmath211 , which is also reflected by a kink in the population mean fitness @xmath213 .",
    "+ ( ii ) a second order error threshold exists at a critical mutation rate @xmath211 , if the ancestral mean mutational distance is continuous , but its derivative with respect to the mutation rate @xmath214_{\\mu\\rightarrow\\mu_c}$ ] is discontinuous at this mutation rate @xmath211 .    in the examples shown later in this thesis , the second order error threshold always show an infinite derivative at the critical mutation rates .",
    "note that , like phase transitions in physics , these definitions of the error thresholds apply in the strict sense only to a system with infinite sequence length ( @xmath178 ) , for finite sequence lengths , the thresholds are smoothed out due to the lack of non - analyticities .",
    "@xcite gave a finer classification of different error threshold phenomena .",
    "the first order error threshold they called `` fitness threshold '' . here",
    ", this term shall include also the second order error threshold , making all error thresholds as defined above fitness thresholds .",
    "furthermore , the concept of the `` degradation threshold '' was introduced :    * definition ( degradation threshold ) . *",
    "+ a degradation threshold is an error threshold of first or second order , where the population distribution beyond the critical mutation rate @xmath211 is given by the equidistribution in sequence space @xmath1 .",
    "thus here the degradation threshold is a special case of a fitness threshold , going in line with the complete delocalisation of the population in sequence space .",
    "note that in the limit of infinite sequence length ( @xmath178 ) , for which the error threshold definitions apply exactly , this equidistribution is reached immediately above @xmath211 , and beyond the threshold the population is insensitive to any further increase in mutation rates . in the case of finite sequence lengths , where the thresholds are smoothed out ,",
    "the equidistribution is of course only reached asymptotically .",
    "the original error threshold was observed for the single peaked fitness landscape , where a single sequence is attributed a high fitness value , all other sequences are equally disadvantageous ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "this is clearly an oversimplification and should not be regarded as anything but a toy model .",
    "other fitness landscapes that have been investigated comprise , in the permutation - invariant case , linear and quadratic fitness functions , general functions showing epistasis , and as examples lacking permutation - invariance the onsager landscape @xcite , which has nearest neighbour interactions within the sequence , as well as various spin glass landscapes like the hopfield landscape @xcite , the sherrington - kirkpatrick spin glass @xcite , the nk spin glass @xcite , and the random energy model @xcite , assigning random fitness values to each sequence .",
    "one fitness landscape where an analytical solution can be obtained is the linear fitness ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note that this corresponds to a multiplicative landscape in a set - up using discrete time . for a linear fitness function",
    ", there is no error threshold , but the population changes smoothly from localised to delocalised with an increasing mutation rate .    for quadratic fitness functions ,",
    "error thresholds only exist for antagonistic epistasis ; they are absent for quadratic fitness functions with synergistic epistasis @xcite .",
    "these results go in line with those for general epistatic fitness functions @xcite .",
    "studies using non - permutation - invariant fitness functions generally report the presence of error thresholds .",
    "of course the discussion of the error threshold phenomenon is academic if the threshold is an artifact of the model rather than a real biological phenomenon .",
    "this issue has been subject to numerous debates , especially because it has first been predicted by a model using the over - simplistic single peaked landscape .",
    "however , over the years biologists have accumulated evidence that particularly rna viruses naturally thrive at very high mutation rates @xcite , of the order of @xmath215 to @xmath216 per base per replication @xcite , corresponding to a genomic mutation rate of about 0.1 to 10 mutations per replication @xcite , and a number of studies have reported that populations of rna viruses only survive a moderate increase of their mutation rate , whereas if the mutation rate is increased further , the populations become extinct @xcite , for reviews see @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the population being pushed beyond the error threshold .",
    "it has been suggested to use the error threshold for anti - viral therapies @xcite , and in fact , recent experimental results indicate that this is the mechanism via which the broad - spectrum anti - viral drug ribavirin works @xcite .",
    "this clearly warrants some further investigation of the error threshold phenomenon , which shall be done in the remainder of this section .",
    "the original hopfield fitness as introduced by @xcite is a quadratic function of the specific distances and reads @xmath217 using normalised specific distances @xmath218 , similarly to the normalised mutational distances @xmath174 .",
    "the statistical properties of this landscape have been studied in detail @xcite : in the thermodynamic limit @xmath219 , there are @xmath220 global maxima that are associated with the patterns @xmath221 and their complements @xmath222 .",
    "in addition to that , the number of local maxima and saddle points grows exponentially with the number patterns @xmath55 , hence the ruggedness of the fitness landscape can be tuned by the number of patterns .",
    "most works that have studied a hopfield - type fitness used the original hopfield model , a generalisation was however treated by @xcite , using a hopfield - type truncation selection with two patterns .",
    "thus it might be interesting and instructive to investigate the threshold behaviour of different kinds of hopfield - type fitness functions .",
    "applying criteria for the existence of error thresholds that have been obtained by @xcite for permutation - invariant fitness functions to the case of a hopfield - type fitness , it can be shown that for linear hopfield - type fitness functions there are no error thresholds , which is a new result , considering that for all previously investigated hopfield - type fitness functions , the existence of error thresholds was reported .",
    "the next step towards more complex fitness functions is to consider quadratic fitness functions , generalising the original hopfield - fitness , which is a particular example for a quadratic function . here",
    ", the analysis shall be restricted to a symmetry with respect to the normalised specific distances @xmath223 to the patterns @xmath56 , such that @xmath224 the parameter @xmath225 tunes the linear in relation to the quadratic term , and the sign of the quadratic term determines the _ epistasis _ , a measure for the strength of interaction between sites . for a positive quadratic term epistasis",
    "is said to be negative or antagonistic , whereas for a negative quadratic term one speaks of positive or synergistic epistasis .",
    "the case @xmath226 combined with a positive quadratic term ( i.e. , negative epistasis ) yields the original hopfield fitness .      in the case of two patterns , @xmath227 ,",
    "the first pattern can be chosen without loss of generality as @xmath228 , such that there is only one pattern to be chosen , usually randomly .",
    "the matrix @xmath88 containing the possible types of sites is given by @xmath229 and thus the index set of sites is partitioned into two subsets , @xmath230 , where @xmath231 contains all sites at which both patterns have entry @xmath122 , whereas @xmath232 corresponds to the sites where the two patterns have entries @xmath122 and @xmath134 , respectively .",
    "the only quantities characterising the patterns are now the fractions of sites in each partition , @xmath233 and @xmath234 .",
    "thus the pattern can be characterised by a single parameter , @xmath235 .",
    "each sequence is characterised with respect to the pattern by the partial hamming distances to pattern @xmath83 ( in normalised form ) , @xmath236 and @xmath237 .",
    "these vary from @xmath122 ( all entries @xmath122 in @xmath96 ) to @xmath134 ( all entries @xmath134 in @xmath96 ) , completely independently from each other . the specific distances with respect to the patterns",
    "are linear combinations of the @xmath209 and given in normalised form by @xmath238 the hopfield - type fitness is defined as an arbitrary function of these patterns , @xmath239 . due to the small number of variables , for the case of two patterns , a lot can be done by analytical treatment .    for the quadratic symmetric hopfield - type fitness ( [ quadratic symmetric hopfield - type fitness ] ) with positive epistasis ( i.e. , negative sign of the quadratic term ) and @xmath240 , there are no phase transitions , going in line with the results for permutation - invariant fitness functions , but different from other results for hopfield - type fitness functions . as an example for negative epistasis , consider first the original hopfield fitness ( [ original hopfield fitness ] ) .",

    "note that this effect is present even though the finite sequence length was only simulated by choosing the patterns accordingly , so it is a feature of the model with correlated patterns .      in this section ,",
    "the quadratic symmetric hopfield - type fitness given in equation ( [ quadratic symmetric hopfield - type fitness ] ) with negative epistasis ( i.e. , positive quadratic term ) was investigated for a small number of patterns .",
    "the results for the original hopfield fitness ( @xmath226 ) have been compared with those for the generalised quadratic hopfield - type fitness ( @xmath317 ) .",
    "furthermore , both uncorrelated patterns ( @xmath290 for all @xmath293 ) , corresponding to an infinite sequence length , and correlated patterns ( @xmath318 ) , simulating a finite sequence length , were considered . for two patterns , an analytical treatment was possible , making all values of the @xmath279 accessible , whereas the case of three or more patterns was treated numerically due to the larger number of variables .",
    "this means that apart from the uncorrelated choice of pattern ( @xmath290 ) , which was investigated for three , four and five patterns , only some correlated combinations for three patterns with @xmath319 were investigated , some typical examples of which are shown in section [ the case of three patterns ] .",
    "the results are summarised as follows :    * * original hopfield fitness ( @xmath226 ) * : * * for _ uncorrelated patterns _ , there is one second order error threshold for all @xmath209 at @xmath254 ( investigated @xmath320 ) . * * for _ correlated patterns _ , there are two second order error thresholds , each for half of the @xmath209 ( investigated @xmath321 ) . * * hopfield - type fitness with @xmath322 * : * * for _ uncorrelated patterns _ , there is a first order error threshold only on a restricted range of @xmath225 ( @xmath323 no first order threshold , @xmath324 $ ] ) .",
    "+ for an even number of patterns ( @xmath325 ) , there is an additional second order error threshold for any @xmath326 ( @xmath327 , @xmath328 ) .",
    "this error threshold does not exist for the investigated cases of an odd number of patterns ( @xmath329 ) . * * for _ correlated patterns _",
    ", at @xmath227 , there is one second order threshold , the other one , which is present for the original hopfield fitness , is smoothed out . at @xmath79 , there is up to one first order threshold , smoothed out for more strongly correlated patterns ( corresponding to shorter sequence length ) .",
    "the evaluation the hopfield - type fitness was limited to the cases of rather small numbers of patterns , simply because an increase in the number of patterns makes the evaluation more complex .",
    "however , the hopfield - type fitness was chosen as a potentially realistic fitness because of its ruggedness that can be tuned by the number of patterns chosen .",
    "the simple cases considered here probably do not show as high a degree of ruggedness as one would expect for realistic fitness functions .",
    "however , the results described here already indicate some features that are common for all numbers of patterns investigated here , and some that depend on whether the number of patterns is odd or even",
    ". it would be very interesting to establish whether these results generalise to an arbitrary number of patterns .",
    "furthermore , the concept of partitioning the set of sites into subsets , which was introduced to analyse the hopfield - type fitness , is very interesting .",
    "one could imagine a different interpretation for this by classifying sites according to the selection strength they evolve under .",
    "some of the behaviour identified for the hopfield system could also occur in such a setting : at intermediate mutation rates , partially ordered phases could exist , such that sites that evolve under weak selection have passed their error threshold and the population is in a phase that is disordered with respect to these sites , whereas at sites that are subject to strong selection the order is still maintained .",
    "the present work has been concerned with the investigation of a deterministic mutation  selection model in the sequence space approach , using a time - continuous formulation .",
    "important observables in these mutation ",
    "selection models are the population and ancestral distributions @xmath23 and @xmath28 , and means with respect to these distributions , in particular the population mean fitness @xmath20 and the ancestral mean genotype @xmath206 . in equilibrium , @xmath23 is given by the right perron - frobenius eigenvector of the time - evolution operator @xmath144 , whereas the ancestral distribution is given by the product of both right and left pf eigenvectors @xmath23 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "types have been modelled as two - state sequences . as mutation model ,",
    "the single step mutation model was used , whereas selection was modelled by hopfield - type fitness functions , using the similarity of a sequence to a number of patterns to determine its fitness .",
    "this allows for a more rugged fitness landscape , and the complexity of the fitness can be tuned by the number of patterns .",
    "the large number of types that arise in the sequence space approach have been lumped into classes of types , labelled by the partial distances @xmath102 introduced in section [ lumping for the hopfield - type fitness ] as a generalisation of the hamming distance . with this , the maximum principle as developed by @xcite can be applied to the case of hopfield - type fitness functions as done in section [ the maximum principle ] , see also @xcite , treating two- and four - state sequences .    in section [ error thresholds ] ,",
    "the maximum principle derived in section [ the maximum principle ] was used to investigate the phenomenon of the error threshold .",
    "these error thresholds can be detected with the maximum principle , because the delocalisation of the population distribution manifests itself as a jump ( or at least an infinite derivative with respect to the mutation rate ) of the ancestral mean genotype @xmath206 , the maximiser .",
    "not all fitness functions give rise to error thresholds , and as the error thresholds were first described for a model with highly unrealistic fitness function , it has been argued that they might be an artifact of this rather than a biologically relevant phenomenon .",
    "it is therefore clearly necessary to investigate more complex fitness functions with respect to this phenomenon .    here , quadratic",
    "hopfield - type fitness functions with small numbers of patterns have been investigated . for the original hopfield fitness ,",
    "the results for all investigated numbers of patterns are identical . however ,",
    "if the fitness differs from the original hopfield fitness , different behaviours are observed for different numbers of patterns . in the case of uncorrelated patterns , corresponding to random patterns chosen for infinite sequence length ,",
    "the observed features seem to depend on whether the number of patterns is odd or even .",
    "because for correlated patterns , only the cases of two and three patterns were investigated , and found to behave differently , it would be interesting to see how these results generalise to a higher number of patterns .    in the original hopfield fitness , error thresholds",
    "were observed for all choices of patterns .",
    "this is not true for a generalised hopfield - type fitness .",
    "for instance , for a hopfield - type fitness with positive epistasis no thresholds were observed , going in line with the results for permutation - invariant fitness . but also for hopfield - type fitness functions with negative epistasis , there are not necessarily any thresholds , if the fitness deviates too much from the original hopfield fitness , challenging the commonly held notion that more complex fitness functions all tend to display error threshold behaviour .",
    "the complexity and ruggedness of the original hopfield fitness have been investigated @xcite and found to be good candidates for realistic fitness functions @xcite",
    ". however , these results do not necessarily transfer to the generalised hopfield - type fitness functions , and therefore it would be very useful to study these properties of a generalised hopfield - type fitness functions to analyse which of these factors are responsible for generating the thresholds .",
