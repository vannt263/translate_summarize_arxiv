    "the uncertainty relation that was discussed by heisenberg earlier in terms of the hypothetical gamma - ray microscope is for the quantum measurement @xcite .",
    "namely , if one measures an observable @xmath0 with a given accuracy ( or with error ) @xmath4 , then the conjugate observable @xmath1 necessarily suffers the disturbance @xmath5 , which satisfies the inequality @xmath6    the heisenberg inequality can be derived by utilizing a quantum mechanical model of measurement processes @xcite . as the first step of measurement the unitary interaction between the object and a probe of measuring apparatus is considered .",
    "the probe is a part of measuring apparatus and works as a front end that interacts with the object quantum - mechanically .",
    "after the interaction , the probe variable @xmath7 , which contains some information on the object variable @xmath0 , is read out by the other part of the measuring apparatus and is fixed as a classical value .",
    "this indirect measurement model is helpful to discuss the error and disturbance associated with measurement .",
    "it has been pointed out that for some types of interactions the heisenberg inequality ( [ eq2 ] ) seems to be violated @xcite .",
    "for example , in the contractive measurement @xcite , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are satisfied simultaneously and the inequality is violated ; @xmath10 . the other extreme case of @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    "is also possible .    in order to reconcile with the above cases ,",
    "a new uncertainty relation was proposed by ozawa @xcite : @xmath13    the ozawa inequality is attracting considerable interests because it admits the cases that violate the limit posed by the heisenberg inequality @xcite",
    ". it might be possible to devise a measurement scheme which is free from the heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "unfortunately , however , no systematic experiments that demonstrate the violation of the heisenberg limit or that make some use of the new bound have been performed so far .    from experimentalists view point",
    ", the definition of the noise and disturbance operators , whose expectation values give the error and disturbance , is the first obstacle .",
    "each of them contains two observables , one for before and the other for after the interaction .",
    "moreover because they are non - commutable , the separate measurements are of no use and a joint measurement seems required essentially @xcite .",
    "however , this difficulty is only an artifact associated with the use of the heisenberg picture in the theory .",
    "it will be shown that the use of schrdinger picture gives more simple perspective . with the probability distributions of corresponding observable , separately measured before and after the interaction , we can examine the error and disturbance .",
    "yet there seems another problem in the definition of the noise and disturbance operators . in the derivation of the ozawa inequality ( [ eq4 ] ) ,",
    "a broad class of measurement interaction is assumed . on the other hand , the definition of the noise and disturbance operators are just borrowed from the case of ideal measurement . in the case of general interactions , we have to consider the amplification ( or deamplification ) of variables due to the unitary transformation @xcite .",
    "the gain , which is unity for the ideal measurement , must be taken into account .",
    "we will show that redefining the error and disturbance operators properly , the violation of the heisenberg inequality is canceled for a broad class of interaction .",
    "a related problem in the discussion of violation of the heisenberg inequality is that the following is admitted unconditionally : the finiteness of disturbance @xmath5 is implied from the finite standard deviation @xmath14 of the object momentum after the interaction . even for the case of finite standard deviation ,",
    "if the distribution of @xmath15 is completely uncorrelated with the original distribution of @xmath1 , then the disturbance should be considered infinitely large so as to destroy the information completely .",
    "similarly the finiteness of the variance @xmath16 of the probe position after the interaction does not imply the finite error @xmath4 .",
    "the error should be considered infinite if the information on @xmath0 is not transferred to @xmath17 at all .",
