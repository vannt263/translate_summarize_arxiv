    "perovskite - based mixed - valence oxides with the general formula @xmath13o@xmath4 , where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are rare - earth , alkali - earth , and transition - metal elements , respectively , have attracted a lot of interest due to a rich variety of their electronic and magnetic states .",
    "these transition - metal oxides exhibit different ordering phenomena and phase transitions , e.g. , antiferromagnetic ( afm ) and/or ferromagnetic ( fm ) order , charge and/or orbital orderings , metal - insulator transitions.@xcite the interplay of different degrees of freedom and different types of ordering is a very important ingredient in determining the properties of such strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "these effects become especially interesting in doped materials , which may exhibit a tendency to phase separation and to the formation of inhomogeneous states.@xcite    in addition to these phenomena common to most doped @xmath16 oxides , cobaltites have an extra `` degree of freedom '' , namely , the co@xmath12  ions in them may occur in different spin states ( belonging to different multiplets ) : low - spin ( ls ; spin @xmath17 ; @xmath18 ) , intermediate - spin ( is ; @xmath19 ; @xmath20 ) , or high - spin ( hs ;",
    "@xmath21 ; @xmath22 ) states with the possibility of spin - state transitions ( sst ) between them caused , e.g. , by temperature , pressure , or doping.@xcite the existence of a spin - state change indicates that the difference of the electronic energies , @xmath23 , between these states is rather small .",
    "the most prominent example is lacoo@xmath4 , which was actively studied and controversially debated for more than 50 years.@xcite it is generally agreed that co@xmath12  ions in lacoo@xmath4 are in the ls state at low temperatures . above approximately 25 k , a higher - spin state , either is or hs , becomes thermally populated affecting various physical properties , e.g. , magnetic susceptibility @xmath24 or thermal expansion @xmath25 , which both exhibit pronounced peaks in their temperature dependence.@xcite the susceptibility is naturally affected because the excited spin state ( is or hs ) induces a significant increase in the magnetization .",
    "the thermal expansion is affected due to the different ionic radii : the ls co@xmath12  ions with empty @xmath26orbitals are significantly smaller than the is or hs co@xmath12ions with partially filled @xmath26  orbitals .",
    "it should be noticed that there are some structural ( neutron diffraction ) data,@xcite which show almost no change in the average co  o bond lengths from 4 to 300  k for a - cite substituted cobaltites with the sst .",
    "instead , a distortion of coo@xmath27 octahedra takes place upon the sst giving rise to an almost unchanged unit cell volume.@xcite in ref .",
    "the nearly constant average co  o bond - length on the sst is attributed to the stronger covalency in the high - temperature phase .    in undoped lacoo@xmath4",
    ", there is not yet a general consensus whether the excited state is is or hs .",
    "for example , our earlier thermal - expansion and magnetic measurements @xcite were interpreted in terms of a temperature - induced excitation of a triplet state , which may suggest that this excited state is an is co@xmath12  ( @xmath19 ) . however , in the presence of a strong spin - orbit coupling , typical for co with partially filled @xmath28  levels , it is the hs co@xmath12 which has a triplet ground state with a total effective moment @xmath29.@xcite this led to the conclusion that the thermally excited state in undoped lacoo@xmath4 is most probably the hs state @xcite in contrast to many earlier claims.@xcite this conclusion is still disputed.@xcite    in hole - doped cobaltites , the situation is even more complex .",
    "one can argue that due to the presence of low - spin co@xmath11 , it would be indeed the is state of co@xmath12 , which is created close to a hole;@xcite this would allow for a free motion of a hole within a cluster of ls co@xmath11  and neighboring is co@xmath12ions.@xcite in the itinerant case , the stabilization of a @xmath30 state due to spin - orbit interaction would also become questionable .",
    "thus , based on these arguments , as well as on the results of ref .  , we conclude that the most plausible scenario is that the doped holes promote a certain amount of co@xmath12  to an is state , with holes moving in a respective co@xmath11/co@xmath12  cluster . due to the usual double exchange @xcite",
    "such clusters would then be ferromagnetic .    the sst in @xmath14coo@xmath4 is strongly affected by both heterovalent and isovalent doping at the @xmath14 site .",
    "the heterovalent doping ( @xmath31@xmath32coo@xmath4 ; @xmath15 = ba , sr , and ca ) causes hole doping and chemical pressure ( arising from the change of the ionic radii in the @xmath33 complex ) and stabilizes a magnetic ( is or hs ) state of co@xmath12.@xcite for the relatively large atomic species @xmath14 = la and @xmath15 = ba or sr , the nonmagnetic ( ls ) insulating ground state of @xmath14coo@xmath4 changes to a ferromagnetic metal at high enough hole concentration , which is due to the enhancement of the double exchange interaction caused by the decrease of @xmath23 and an increase in the number of electrons at the @xmath26  orbitals .",
    "the isovalent doping with a smaller rare - earth , i.e. , chemical pressure without changing the co valence , is usually realized by introducing other trivalent rare - earth ions @xmath34 . in that case , the ls state of co@xmath12  ions is stabilized and the spin - state transition is shifted to a higher temperature . for example , the energy gap between the ls and the excited spin state increases from about @xmath35  k for @xmath14 = la to @xmath36  k for @xmath14 = eu.@xcite in addition , with decreasing ionic radius in the lanthanide series , the structure changes from rhombohedral in lacoo@xmath4 to orthorhombic for @xmath14 = pr , nd , and eu.@xcite the changes in the ionic radius can be also fine - tuned by mixing @xmath14 elements with different ionic radii .",
    "in this situation , the partial substitution of @xmath34 by a smaller @xmath37 in ( @xmath38)@xmath39coo@xmath4 systematically increases the chemical pressure , which should enhance the crystal field splitting and therefore stabilize the low - spin state.@xcite thus , small changes in the lattice characteristics may critically determine the physical properties of cobaltites .",
    "phenomena , for which the crystal lattice plays a significant role , usually show a strong isotope effect , and vice versa studies of the isotope effect can yield important information about the underlying mechanisms .",
    "one famous example is the isotope effect in conventional superconductors , which led to the conclusion that in these systems the electron pairing is caused by the electron - phonon interaction . in some cases ,",
    "especially if the system is close to a crossover between different states , an isotope substitution can drastically change the properties of the system .",
    "for example , in manganites , one can even induce a metal - insulator transition by substituting @xmath8o  by @xmath9o.@xcite moreover , the isotope substitution can be also used for fine - tuning the behavior of a system , without stronger disturbances such as those caused , e.g. , by doping ( which introduce extra disorder ) . in this sense , the isotope substitution is an even `` softer '' way to control the behavior of a material . for cobaltites with the sst , we can expect a particularly pronounced isotope effect because of the strong involvement of the lattice in it due to the fact that the ionic radii of different spin states are very different : the ionic radius of hs co@xmath12  ( @xmath40 ) is by about 15% larger than that for the ls state ( @xmath41 ) .    indeed , the first measurements @xcite have already demonstrated the existence of an oxygen isotope effect in cobaltites with spin - state transitions . with increasing @xmath42 in ( pr@xmath43sm@xmath44)@xmath2ca@xmath3coo@xmath4 , a crossover from a ferromagnetic metal to an insulator exhibiting a spin - state transition was found .",
    "the authors observed @xcite that the oxygen isotope substitution strongly shifts the spin - state transition temperature @xmath45 in the insulating phase , but only slightly affects the ferromagnetic transition point @xmath46 .",
    "this contrasting behavior in the two phases was explained by the occurrence of static jahn - teller ( jt ) distortions in the insulating phase and the absence of them in the metallic phase . here , a remark should be made .",
    "the co@xmath12ions in the is state have formally the @xmath20 configuration , i.e. , they indeed could exhibit a pronounced jt effect .",
    "however , if the corresponding @xmath26  electrons are itinerant , which seems to be the case in our system , one should not expect a strong jt effect . therefore , we do not think that the coupling to the lattice in this case has predominantly a jt character , as assumed in ref .  ;",
    "rather , simply the difference of the ionic sizes of the ls and the is or hs states of co@xmath12  should play the most important role here .    in the present study",
    ", we tried to clarify the nature of the strong difference in the character of the magnetic / spin - state transition for the `` metallic '' and `` insulating '' ground states . for this , in particular , we used the oxygen isotope exchange to influence the crystal - field splitting without additional effects of static distortions .",
    "for these purposes , the ( pr@xmath0eu@xmath1)@xmath2ca@xmath3coo@xmath4  ( @xmath47 ) series with @xmath8o  and @xmath9owere studied .",
    "this series was chosen to span the range of ground states from metal - like to insulating ones .",
    "we measured d.c .",
    "magnetization , low - frequency a.c .  magnetic susceptibility , thermal expansion , specific heat , and resistivity . based on these results ,",
    "we have constructed a detailed phase diagram representing different magnetic and spin states .",
    "we find that with increasing eu doping , that is , with decreasing average size of ( pr@xmath0eu@xmath1 ) or increasing chemical pressure , the ground state of the compound changes from a `` ferromagnetic metal '' to a `` weakly - magnetic insulator '' at @xmath48 .",
    "a pronounced sst is present in the insulating ground state ( in the samples with @xmath49 ) .",
    "the metallic ground state ( in the samples with @xmath50 has completely different magnetic properties , without any indications of a temperature - induced spin - state transition .",
    "there is even no well - defined magnetic transition as a function of temperature for this phase .",
    "instead , a smooth crossover to a paramagnetic state takes place .",
    "the isotope exchange affects strongly the sst temperature in the insulating regime , but has only a marginal effect on the crossover temperature in the samples with the metallic ground state .",
    "possible implications of the spin ordering of co@xmath11  ions for the spin - state transition are also discussed .",
    "in our measurements , we used ceramic ( pr@xmath0eu@xmath1)@xmath2ca@xmath3coo@xmath4  samples with both @xmath8o  and @xmath9o .",
    "a series of samples with @xmath47 was synthesized . the substitution of pr by eu results in the decrease of the average ionic radius of the rare - earth combination .",
    "this enhances the static crystallographic distortion and is followed by an increase of the crystal - field splitting that should result in a stabilization of the low - spin state against the temperature - activated spin - state transition to the intermediate- or high - spin state .",
    "the pr and eu content in ( pr@xmath0eu@xmath1)@xmath2ca@xmath3coo@xmath4  was chosen from the data on ionic radii from shannon s tables @xcite for nine - fold coordination of rare - earth and alkaline - earth cations , which is usually accepted for cobaltites with orthorhombic symmetry of the perovskite structure .",
    "the chosen stoichiometries span the mean rare - earth radius @xmath51 in the range from 1.172    to 1.164   , for @xmath47 .",
    "the end - member of this series , eu@xmath2ca@xmath3coo@xmath4 , was also studied and some results obtained earlier @xcite on @xmath14coo@xmath4 with @xmath14 = la , pr , nd , eu are referred below for comparison .",
    "the ( pr@xmath0eu@xmath1)@xmath2ca@xmath3coo@xmath4  samples were prepared by the `` paper synthesis '' technique:@xcite ash - free paper filters were impregnated with an aqueous solution of a mixture of nitrates of the corresponding metals , dried at 120@xmath52c , and then burnt .",
    "the resultant powder was annealed at @xmath53@xmath52c  for 2  h for decarbonization . after pressing",
    ", the ceramics were sintered at @xmath54@xmath52c  for 100  h. the x - ray analysis with rigaku smartlab diffractometer ( using cu@xmath55 irradiation , @xmath56   ) demonstrated that the samples are single - phase without observable admixture of impurity phases ( fig .",
    "[ xrd ] ) .",
    "all the data were indexed in the orthorhombic lattice @xmath57 .",
    "no structure modification was observed with eu - doping .",

    "@xcite obtained by both x - ray and neutron diffraction techniques .",
    "the unit cell volume for our series is about 0.15% smaller as compared to the ( pr@xmath0sm@xmath1)ca@xmath3coo@xmath4 series which is naturally attributed to the smaller ionic radius of europium as compared to samarium .",

    "hereafter , these samples are referred to as eu@xmath1-@xmath62 , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 or 18 denote the eu content and the oxygen isotope , respectively .",
    "we performed measurements for all the samples of the series , but in most cases only the results for the samples with @xmath61 , 0.18 , 0.22 , and 0.26 are shown because for samples , which differ in @xmath63 by only 0.02 , the data in almost all cases overlap when the oxygen isotope is exchanged , i.e. , the data of eu@xmath65 - 18 overlap with those eu@xmath66 - 16 and so on .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the @xmath8o  to @xmath9o  isotope substitution was carried out by annealing the samples in oxygen at 950@xmath52c  for 200  h. the gas pressure was equal to 1  bar .",
    "two samples of rectangular shape prepared from the same pellet were simultaneously annealed , one in @xmath8o@xmath67 and the other in @xmath9o@xmath67 ( 93% of @xmath9o@xmath67 ) .",
    "the final enrichment of the samples with @xmath9owas 92% , as determined from the weight change .",
    "the enrichment process is described in detail elsewhere.@xcite the similarity of the oxygen isotope composition in the sample to that in the gas medium indicated that a thermodynamic equilibrium was achieved during annealing and , hence , the difference in the diffusion rates of the oxygen isotopes did not significantly affect the results of the investigation .",
    "it should also be noted that the mass of a sample annealed in @xmath8o@xmath67 remained unchanged ( within the experimental error ) during the prolonged heat treatment .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the annealing procedure does not change the oxygen stoichiometry in the compounds under study .",
    "the measurement of the real oxygen stoichiometry via iodometric titration in oxygen - exchanged samples does not provide a relevant accuracy because of the small amount of sample mass .",
    "however , the data obtained for samples of pr@xmath2sr@xmath3coo@xmath4 [ ] and la@xmath2sr@xmath3coo@xmath4 [ ] prepared under normal oxygen pressure show that the expected oxygen deficiency should be about @xmath68 .",
    "the comparison of the transition temperatures for closely related ( prsm)@xmath2ca@xmath3coo@xmath4 samples annealed under oxygen pressure of 1 bar [ ] and of 60 bar [ ] suggests that the presumed oxygen deficiency hardly affects the physical properties .",
    "the magnetization of the samples was measured in a vibrating sample magnetometer insert to the quantum design ppms in the magnetic field range up to 14  t at temperatures 2  300  k. for some measurements at low magnetic fields , a quantum design squid ( mpms ) was used .",

    "the electrical resistance @xmath70 of the samples was measured using the four - probe technique [ a two - probe method was used for @xmath71 in the temperature range from 5 to 330  k in magnetic fields up to 4  t ; the magnetic field was directed parallel to the transport current .",
    "the specific heat @xmath72 was measured using the quantum design ppms by the two - tau relaxation technique from 2  300  k in magnetic fields up to 14  t. high - resolution measurements of the linear thermal expansion coefficient @xmath73 were performed on heating from 4 to 180  k using a home - built capacitance dilatometer .",
    "the measurements of thermal expansion @xmath25 are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ alpha ] . here and further on ,",
    "we denote the samples according to table  [ table1 ] .",
    "obviously , the data can be split in two groups : the `` highly distorted '' ( hd ) samples ( larger @xmath63 ) show pronounced anomalies , which are almost completely absent in the `` less distorted '' ( ld ) samples .",
    "the borderline between both groups is located at @xmath74 and depends on the oxygen isotope or , in other words , the ( almost ) absence or presence of this strong anomaly can be switched by exchanging the oxygen isotope from @xmath8o  to @xmath9o . as will become clearer in the following , we can attribute these large anomalies to a spin - state transition of the co@xmath12  ions , which in this series manifests itself as a first - order phase transition .",
    "the fact that the anomalies are comparatively broad ( fwhm is about 25  k ) indicates that there is a large temperature range of phase coexistence and there are also indications that the different phases even coexist up to the highest and lowest measured temperatures ( see below ) .",
    "this is most probably also the cause , why the residues of these anomalies are still visible in some of the ld samples ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ alpha ] ) . as mentioned above",
    ", a strong lattice expansion is expected to occur at a sst due to the significantly different ionic radii of the ls and the higher - spin states of co@xmath12 .",
    "we would like to stress , however , that the behavior here is very different from that of lacoo@xmath4 @xcite or other rcoo@xmath4 compounds.@xcite the anomalous expansion due to the sst of lacoo@xmath4 , which for comparison is also shown in fig .",
    "[ alpha ] , has the typical form of a schottky anomaly meaning that the sst is related to the thermal population of an energetically higher - lying higher - spin state , while here we are dealing with a real ( but broadened ) first - order phase transition in the thermodynamic sense .",
    "this explains the very symmetric shape of the @xmath25 anomalies ( an idealized first - order phase transition would yield a jump in @xmath75 and a @xmath76 peak in @xmath25 ) . despite the different shapes of the @xmath25 anomalies of lacoo@xmath4 and of ( pr@xmath0eu@xmath1)@xmath2ca@xmath3coo@xmath4 , the total length changes @xmath77 up to 150  k are in the range of @xmath78 to @xmath79 for all the samples shown in the right panel of fig .  [ alpha ] .            in fig .",
    "[ cp ] , the specific heat measurements are illustrated .",
    "again , we observe the clear difference between the ld and hd samples .",
    "the hd samples show pronounced anomalies at temperatures , which well agree with those of the corresponding anomalies in @xmath25 .",
    "the shape of these anomalies is also rather symmetric as expected for a broadened first - order phase transition .",
    "in addition , there are low - temperature upturns in @xmath80 for all hd samples measured to low enough @xmath81 ( see inset ) , which indicate the occurrence of another phase transition at @xmath82  k. both features are absent in the ld samples as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "another aspect is seen in the high - temperature limit : independent of the presence or absence of the anomalies , all @xmath80 curves of the @xmath8o  samples practically meet in a single line , which is slightly lower than the corresponding line where all the @xmath80 curves of the @xmath9o  samples meet .",
    "this difference arises from the lowering of the frequencies of those phonons , which contain vibrations of heavy oxygen .",
    "thus , at fixed @xmath81 , the number of excited oxygen modes in an @xmath8o  sample is less than in the corresponding @xmath9o  sample and therefore the lattice specific heat is less in the former .",
    "this systematic behavior of our samples clearly confirms the high reliability of the oxygen exchange in this series .",
    "similar isotope effects in @xmath72 of binary solids zno and pbs were theoretically and experimentally studied in refs .  .",
    "magnetization of ( pr@xmath0eu@xmath1)@xmath2ca@xmath3coo@xmath4at 2  k as a function of magnetic field .",
    "magnetization was measured after zero - field cooling .",
    "the paramagnetic contribution of pr@xmath12 is subtracted , based on the measurements of prcoo@xmath4 weighted by the actual pr content in each sample ( see also fig .  [ loops-14 t ] ) .",
    "the left panels correspond to the ld samples , the right panels are for the hd samples .",
    "]    now , we turn to the magnetization measurements .",
    "figure  [ loops-2k ] displays representative @xmath83 curves measured at 2  k on ld ( left panels ) and hd samples ( right panels ) .",
    "again , there is a clear difference ; the ld samples exhibit a pronounced hysteresis , as it is typical for ferromagnets , with a large remanence and a coercitivity of the order of 1  t. a hysteretic behavior is also present for the hd samples , but it is much weaker and also qualitatively different .",
    "this is best seen by considering the irreversible parts of the @xmath83 curves .",
    "the irreversible part of the magnetization @xmath84 is defined as the half - difference of the @xmath83 curves measured with increasing and decreasing magnetic field . in this consideration ,",
    "the virgin curve was withdrawn .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ m - irrev ] .",
    "the ld samples have broad @xmath85 curves with a weak negative curvature around zero field , while the @xmath85 curves of the hd samples have essentially an almost cusp - like shape centered at zero field .",

    "@xmath84 is defined as the half - difference of the magnetization measured in increasing and decreasing magnetic fields .",
    "the arrows indicate the sequence of curves ( from ld to hd samples ) . ]",
    "such a crossover from the high - remanence state to the soft magnetic state was observed both for @xmath15-site isovalent substitution @xcite and on heterovalent doping with sr.@xcite in contrast to our case , the results of ref .",
    "for @xmath86sr@xmath87coo@xmath4 demonstrated that the coercitivity _ increases _ significantly with decreasing the mean radius of the @xmath14 ion . in our observations ,",
    "the coercitivity _ decreases _ with decreasing ionic radius ( increasing eu content ) . in the case of la@xmath43sr@xmath44coo@xmath4 , @xcite the coercitivity peaks at @xmath88 and drops almost to zero at @xmath89 , just before the transition to the ferromagnetic metallic state .",
    "this effect was suggested to originate from the formation of thermally stable nanoscale ferromagnetic droplets in a nonmagnetic matrix that results in the peak in coercitivity . with further increase of the sr content",

    ", the coercitivity grows from about zero for @xmath90 to 8  koe for @xmath91 , with the steep increase being visible at @xmath92 , and retains the same value up to the end - member pr@xmath2ca@xmath3coo@xmath4.@xcite this suggests that the nanosize ferromagnetic particles nucleate at @xmath92 and then grow up to @xmath93 without a crossover to the multidomain - droplet state .",
    "the occurrence of ferromagnetic - like hysteresis loops in the ld samples is rather surprising because on increasing temperature the @xmath94 and @xmath95 data do not exhibit any clear indications of a well - defined ordering transition ( see fig .",
    "[ alpha ] and fig .",
    "the same is true for temperature dependent measurements of the d.c .",
    "magnetization in finite magnetic fields ( not shown ) .",
    "thus , we think that the origin of the hysteresis loops is most probably related to the coexistence of different `` phases '' with competing magnetic interactions and , simply speaking , the hysteresis measures the `` ferromagnetic '' phase fraction .",

    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ chi ] , the ld samples have a strong increase of @xmath98 at about 50  k , which is followed by a complicated two - hump feature on further cooling . with increasing eu content this increase systematically shifts toward lower temperature and we used the maximum slope of @xmath99 as the criterion for the definition of the crossover temperature for the phase diagram .",

    "another difference is shown in the inset of fig .",

    "all these features can be naturally explained by a spin - state transition from a ls to a higher - spin state of the co@xmath12  ions , because the latter have ( i ) a larger volume , ( ii ) more spin entropy , and ( iii ) a finite magnetic moment . to be more precise , the larger unit cell volume , which is discussed here",

    "it is also possible that as shown in ref .",
    "[ ] , the increase of the co  o  co bond angle ( and concomitant coo@xmath27 octahedra distortions ) could solely be responsible for the anomalous volume expansion upon the sst .",
    "the drop in the resistivity ( iv ) suggests that the higher spin state is the is state , because ls - co@xmath11/is - co@xmath12  neighbors allow for an easy electron transfer via the @xmath26  orbitals , whereas for ls - co@xmath11/ls - co@xmath12  only a hopping via the @xmath28orbitals , which have much less overlap , is possible and for the ls co@xmath11/hs",

    "the oxygen - isotope exchange ( @xmath8o  to @xmath9o ) shifts the phase boundaries to the lower eu concentration , i.e. , an increase of the oxygen mass acts similarly to an increase of the eu content .",
