    "the basic building block for molecular electronic devices is a single molecular junction - a molecule attached to two metal electrodes held at different electronic chemical potentials .",
    "one of the most distinct features of molecular junctions in comparison to other nanoscale electronic devices is the absence of the structural rigidity and , as a result , the strong interplay between electronic and nuclear dynamics @xcite .",
    "electron - vibration interaction leads to a variety of interesting transport phenomena such as negative differential resistance @xcite , frank - condon blockade @xcite , current induced chemical reactions@xcite , cooling of nuclear motion by electric current @xcite    recently , there have been a significant experimental and theoretical interest in studying electron molecular electron transport properties which go beyond average electric current .",
    "investigation of noise , full counting statistics , and fluctuation relations have been recently reported @xcite .",
    "electrical current fluctuations in molecules is no longer just a theoretical concept , they have become the important experimental method to characterize the physical mechanisms of electron transport in molecular junctions @xcite .    electron transport through a molecular junction is unavoidably stochastic due to quantum nature of the process .",
    "electrons are transferred from source to drain electrode across the molecular bridge one by one at random but specific times .",
    "what are the delay times between these electron tunnelling events and what are the distributions of these times ?",
    "how does coupling of electronic and nuclear motion manifest itself in this distribution ?",
    "these are the questions which interest us in this paper .",
    "the sequential stochastic processes , in general , and quantum electron transport , in particular , can be naturally understood and characterised in terms of waiting time distribution ( wtd ) @xcite .",
    "wtd is a conditional probability distribution that we observe the electron transfer in the detector electrode ( it does not matter drain or source electrodes , in the steady state they measure the same statistics ) at time @xmath2 given that an electron was detected in the same electrode at time @xmath1 .",
    "wtd is the complementary and much more intuitive physical quantity in comparison with very popular full counting statistics in quantum transport .",
    "wtd has recently gained significant popularity in the study current fluctuations in nanoscale and mesoscale systems @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section ii contains the derivation of master equation for electron transport through a molecular junction described by anderson- holstein model . in section iii",
    ", we derive the main equations for wtd and waiting time cumulant - generating function .",
    "section iv describes the results of numerical calculation .",
    "section iv summarises the main results of the paper .",
    "we use natural units in equations throughout the paper : @xmath3 .",
    "the molecule is described by spinless anderson - holstein model in which a single electronic level is coupled to a localised vibrational mode .",
    "electrons can tunnel between the molecule and source ( s ) and drain ( d ) electrodes .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is @xmath4 the molecule is described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath5 where @xmath6 molecular orbital energy , @xmath7 is molecular vibration energy , and @xmath8 is the strength of the electron - vibration coupling .",
    "@xmath9 creates ( annihilates ) an electron on molecular orbital , and @xmath10 is bosonic creation ( annihilation ) operator for the molecular vibration . the electronic spin does not play any physical role in the discussed processes and will not be included explicitly into the equations .",
    "electrodes consist of noninteracting electrons : @xmath11 where @xmath12 creates an electron in the single - particle state @xmath13 of the source(drain ) electrode @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the corresponding electron annihilation operator .",
    "the bias voltage applied to the junction is imposed by shifting symmetrically the chemical potentials of the electrodes @xmath16 .",
    "the electron tunnelling is described by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the tunnelling amplitudes .    to eliminate electron - vibration coupling from @xmath19",
    "we perform lang - firsov unitary rotation of molecular operators @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are transformed creation ( annihilation ) operators for molecular electron and vibration .",
    "the lang - firsov transformation is unitary so that it preserves commutation or anticommutation relations between the operators .",
    "the molecular hamiltonian in the transformed operator basis becomes @xmath23 here renormalised molecular orbital energy @xmath24 includes polaron shift @xmath25 .",
    "the hamiltonian for the electrodes is not affected and the tunnelling interaction becomes @xmath26 after lang - firsov transformation the eigenvectors and eigenenergies of molecular hamiltonian are easily computed and standard theoretical methods are applied to derive the master equation @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the probability that the molecule is occupied by @xmath29 electrons and populated by @xmath30 vibration at time @xmath1 .",
    "the rates for the transition from state occupied by one electron and @xmath30 vibrations to the electronically unoccupied state with @xmath31 vibrations by the electron transfer from the molecule to @xmath32 electrode is @xmath33 and the rate for the transition when electron is transferred from @xmath34 electrode into the originally empty molecules simultaneously changing the vibrational state from @xmath30 to @xmath31 is @xmath35 .",

    "we introduce vector of probabilities , which is ordered such that the electronic populations enter in pairs for each vibrational sub - bands : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the total number of vibrational sub - bands included into the calculations .",
    "we also define the identity vector of length @xmath47 : @xmath48 the normalisation of probability is given by the scalar product between @xmath49 and @xmath50 vectors @xmath51 , which is defined in a standard mathematical way as @xmath52",
    "let us re - write the master equation ( [ me1],[me2 ] ) in the matrix form @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the the total liouvillian operator , which can be explicitly identified using eqs .",
    "( [ me1],[me2 ] ) .",
    "we also define 4 different quantum jumps operators @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 for the transitions involving changes of molecular electronic population . the quantum jump operators are @xmath59 matrices which are defined through their actions on the probability vector : @xmath60 @xmath61 the jump operator @xmath62 transforms the system from the electronically empty state to the singly occupied state by tunnelling of an electron from the @xmath34 electrode into the molecule .",
    "the jump operator @xmath63 describes the reverse process : it transforms the molecule from being occupied by one electron to being empty by transferring one electron from the molecule to the @xmath34 electrode .    after these preliminary definitions and rearrangement of the rate equation , we are ready to derive the expression for wtd for each quantum jump operator .",
    "we assume that the system has evolved to the nonequilibrium steady state .",
    "that means it is described by the steady state density matrix , which is the null vector of the full liouvillian ",
    "@xmath64 let us begin to monitor time delays between sequential quantum tunnelling in the nonequilibrium steady state .",
    "first , we define _ wtd as the conditional probability distribution that we observe electron tunnelling @xmath65 at time @xmath2 given that the molecule undergoes the same quantum jump @xmath65 at earlier time @xmath1 _ @xmath66 wtd does not depend on the reference time @xmath1 in the steady state regime . reading this equation from right to left",
    "elucidates its physical meaning .",

    "there were no other electron transfer events _ of the same type @xmath67 _ between time @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "wtd ( [ wtd1 ] ) is not normalised yet .",
    "we assume that over all time @xmath71 the probability for a quantum jump to occur is unity . integrating over the waiting time yields @xmath72 here we take into account ( easy to prove from the conservation of the probability ) property of the liouvillian that @xmath73 for an arbitrary vector @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the normalized wtd becomes : @xmath75 we have 4 different wtds associated with each 4 quantum jump operators for electron tunnelling @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .    to compute higher - order expectation values and analyse the fluctuations ,",
    "it is convenient to introduce the cumulant - generating function for the wtd as @xmath76 this expression can be further simplified and brought to the form suitable for numerical calculations : @xmath77 we obtain all possible higher order comulants simply by direct differentiation of @xmath78 with respect to @xmath79 .",

    "fig.[iv ] shows the current - voltage characteristics .",
    "it has been studied intensively in numerous works before @xcite and we show it here simply to serve as a reference - the characteristics steps in the current - voltage characteristic will be shortly connected to the behaviour of wtds .",
    "the steps in the current is related to the resonant excitations of the vibration states by electric current which occur when the voltage passes through an integer multiple of the vibration energy .",
    "these steps are smoothed due to the temperature effects .    .",

    "it is computed with the use of ( [ wtd2 ] ) . for molecular junction",
    "symmetrically coupled to the source and drain electrodes @xmath92 this quantity is exactly the same as the wtd for electron transfer from the source electrode to the molecule , @xmath93 .",
    "the interesting feature of this distribution is that it becomes less spread as the voltage increases whereas the mode of the distribution , that is the value of waiting time between electron transfer events that appears most often in the electron transport - it corresponds to the peak of the distribution , remains more or less constant .",
    "fig.[avt1 ] illustrates this observation more directly by showing the average waiting time between electron detection in the drain electrode , dispersion @xmath94 and mode time for wtd @xmath91 as functions of applied voltage .",
    "the mode time is almost not affected by the voltage and remains approximately the same as the equilibrium value .",
    "therefore , if we monitor electric current spikes that most often observed time delays do not depend on voltage at all .",
    "the average waiting time ( the difference between mode time and average time can be associated with skewness of the distribution ) decreases as the voltage grows and shows the characteristic step behaviour related to excitation of the vibrational states by the tunnelling electrons .",
    "we see similar but much more pronounced behaviour for the dispersion of the distribution .",
    "if population of the vibrational states does not change , the wtd remains the same even if the voltage increased .",
    "when the number of excited vibrations rises by one quanta , the wtd is squeezed in step - like fashion ( both skewness and dispersion shrinks abruptly when the vibrational state is excited ) .",
    "therefore , the microscopic mechanism of current growth is the reduction of the long tail of slow electrons by making the wtd narrower around its mode value .    ):",

    "the values of the probability distribution at the peak is reduced and the distribution is more shifted towards the larger waiting times , indicating that it takes longer for electron to transverse the molecule when the electron is strongly coupled to the molecular vibration . as seen in fig .",
    "[ avt2 ] the mode of the distribution shows almost no voltage dependence and the average waiting time demonstrates step - wise decrease similar to the moderate electron - vibration interaction @xmath98 case .",
    "the main changes in wtd is the dramatic reduction of the dispersion of the waiting time for tunnelling electrons when we move away from the equilibrium by increasing the applied voltage bias .     in strong electron - phonon coupling regime .",
