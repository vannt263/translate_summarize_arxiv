    "@xcite . in the present work we consider one of such qmc methods , the phaseless auxiliary fields quantum monte carlo ( afqmc ) @xcite , which is considered less sensitive than fn to the quality of the trial function @xcite .",

    "let us consider the stochastic process defined by the succession of wave functions : @xmath35 where the operators @xmath36 are functions of independent normally - distributed random variables @xmath37 .",
    "it is known , and will be shown in details in [ appa1 ] , that , if @xmath38 , all the random variables @xmath39 take values in @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , their average is given by : @xmath40 the expression clearly shows that the solution of the imaginary time schrdinger equation can be recovered as average of a suitable stochastic process , the structure of which is suggested by . combining and it is evident that numerical sampling of such stochastic process provides a stochastic linear combination of slater determinants , representing an estimation of the ground state of .",
    "although its formal simplicity , the straightforward numerical implementation leads in general to an exponential increase in statistical errors with the imaginary time , due to the fact that complex random phases appear during the evolution .",
    "s. zhang invented a stabilization procedure to modify the stochastic process in order to plug into the sampling information that _ guides _ the random walk , closely resembling the typical scheme adopted in configurational dmc simulations : an _ importance sampling transformation _",
    "the state @xmath41 is rewritten in the following form , detailed in [ appa3 ] and equivalent to : @xmath42   \\ , \\frac{{\\hat{g}(\\boldsymbol{\\eta}_{n-1}-\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{n-1 } ) } \\dots { \\hat{g}(\\boldsymbol{\\eta}_{0}-\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{0 } ) } { { | \\psi_t \\rangle}}}{{\\langle   \\psi_t | { \\hat{g}(\\boldsymbol{\\eta}_{n-1}-\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{n-1 } ) } \\dots { \\hat{g}(\\boldsymbol{\\eta}_{0}-\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{0 } ) } | \\psi_t \\rangle}}\\\\ \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where _ complex - valued shift parameters _ @xmath43 and a weight function have been inserted .",

    "the shift parameters are chosen to minimize fluctuations in the importance function to first order in @xmath46 . as it will be described in [ appa3 ] ,",
    "the complex - valued importance function is subsequently turned into a _ real positive quantity _ by the so - called _ _ real local energy__@xcite approximation : @xmath47 \\simeq e^{-{\\delta\\tau}(\\epsilon_{loc}(\\psi)-\\epsilon_0)}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 $ ] is the _ local energy _",
    "the importance sampling expressions , clearly show the mechanism responsible for the appearence of the sign problem in the framework of afqmc : _ when the overlap between one or more walkers and the trial state vanishes _ massive fluctuations in the importance function occur , determining _",
    "drastic statistic errors in afqmc estimates _",
    ", for the solution of and for ground state averages of many body observables .",
    "since it has been argued @xcite that the vanishing of such overlap always occurs when its phase changes abruptly , control of the fermion sign problem is accomplished implementing the so - called _ phase approximation _ , in which the importance function of walkers undergoing an abrupt phase change , in the sense that the quantity : @xmath49 \\right]\\ ] ] has negative cosine , is put equal to 0 .",
    "we observe here that to our knowledge there is no rigorous proof that a perfect correlation relates sudden phase change and vanishing of the overlap with the trial state , and that the real local energy approximation and the phase approximation produce unbiased estimators , .",
    "one of the topics investigated in the present work is the actual verification of these conditions for a model system .",
    "the so - far introduced observations give rise to a _ polynomially complex _",
    "algorithm for numerically sampling the solution , the efficency of which relies on the observation that the walkers @xmath50 lie in @xmath25 and can be therefore parametrized with an @xmath51 complex - valued matrix , as discussed in [ appa1 ] .",
    "the algorithm can be resumed in the following sequence of operations :    1 .",

    "being constructed with the imaginary time evolution operator , the itcf is a natural quantity to be evaluated in qmc calculations .",
