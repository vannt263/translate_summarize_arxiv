    "string theory , spoken or unspoken , is generally assumed to be the underpinning of the low scale gravity ideas @xcite explored theoretically and experimentally in recent years .",
    "a number of examples of ambitious `` top - down '' models of string realizations of low scale gravity ideas have been advanced , aiming at consistently achieving the connection to standard model ( sm ) physics from higher mass scales in certain d - brane scenarios @xcite . as yet a fully realistic model like the sm has not been constructed . on the other hand",
    ", one could take a more phenomenological approach , from the `` bottom up '' .",
    "one of the recent endeavors is to obtain the sm tree - level amplitudes at low energies @xcite based on open - string amplitudes @xcite .",
    "this approach assures the correct low energy phenomenology as given by the sm , yet captures one of the essential features of string theory , namely the string resonances , in a relatively model - independent way .",
    "the basic assumptions in this approach are that the fundamental string scale @xmath5 is at the order of one @xmath6 , and that the dominant contributions to the low energy processes are due to the exchange of string resonances . earlier work on phenomenological studies dealt with qed from the @xmath7 scale to the first few string resonances @xcite , or neutrino inclusive processes far above the string scale to explore the effects from cosmic neutrinos @xcite .",
    "phenomenologically , this string - amplitude approach complements the low - scale gravity calculations based on expansions in kaluza - klein modes @xcite , which are argued to be higher orders in string - coupling expansion @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this note is to expand this effort to model both _",
    "neutral and charged current _ interactions at energies below the string scale .",
    "data from hera experiments at desy , with lepton - parton center of mass ( cm ) energies receiving a good fraction of the full 320 gev , the highest energy available in laboratory experiments for deep inelastic scattering , provides one interesting testing ground for low - scale string model ideas .",
    "similarly lep - ii , with cm energies up to 200 gev provide another reasonably sensitive probe of the low energy limit of our string - resonance amplitudes .",
    "the full cm energy is available to excite string effects in this case . at the tevatron , though the parton - parton collisions get typically only a modest fraction of the @xmath8 tev available in the @xmath9 cm energy , there is still sensitivity to @xmath10 tev scale physics .",
    "the good agreement between all of the data from the facilities just mentioned and the sm allows bounds to be set on the mass scale of all kinds of new physics effects .",
    "for example , leptoquark states are one such effect , and perturbative string resonances can carry the same quantum numbers as the lepto - quarks in some channels @xcite . at the parton level ,",
    "much of the kinematical range is low enough to justify keeping the lowest order terms in an expansion in inverse string scale .",
    "this allows a direct comparison of amplitudes with the existing limits on new physics contact interactions @xcite .",
    "these observations that a comprehensive bound can be applied to a wide class of string - resonance models motivate the work we present here .",
    "we hope that exploration of the constraints imposed on the model parameters by the agreement between data and the sm will ultimately shed light on the way string theory signals could emerge as laboratory energies rise above the currently available regime .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ amplitudes ] , we summarize the construction of neutral and charged current interactions for sm light fermions based on open - string scattering amplitudes .",
    "we then in sec .  [ contact ] take the low - energy expansion by expanding the string amplitudes in powers of the inverse string scale evaluated at typical kinematic points to obtain the effective four - fermion contact - like interactions .",
    "we check that the approximation is good in the kinematic ranges we use . comparing with the current limits on these interactions , we derive bounds on the string scale @xmath5 .",
    "we conclude in sec .",

    "in weakly - coupled string theory with a low string - scale , one generically expects the string amplitude corrections to the standard model processes to dominate over the graviton corrections , which enter at one loop and are parameterically suppressed by an extra factor of @xmath11 , a gauge coupling squared @xcite . at energies well below @xmath5 ,",
    "the stringy corrections can be systematically taken into account by the low - energy expansion of the string amplitudes in terms of @xmath12 .",
    "we assume that the tree - level string amplitudes represent the scattering of massless sm particles , as the zero string modes .",
    "the first attempt at exploring the low - scale string amplitudes was made to construct a string toy model of qed of electrons and photons @xcite .",
    "the sm is embedded in a type iib string theory whose 10-dimensional space has six dimensions compactified on a torus with common period @xmath13 .",
    "there are n coincident d3-branes , on which open strings may end , that lie in the 4 extended dimensions .",
    "the extra symmetry of the massless string modes are eliminated by ( unspecified ) orbifold projection .",
    "the paper applies the results to bhaba scattering and then adds several prescriptions to include some simple processes @xmath14 and @xmath15 2 jets , where @xmath16 represents a string resonance excitation of the gluon .",
    "however , this toy model does not attempt to be fully realistic in terms of the sm particle spectrum and their interactions .",
    "our construction of the tree graph amplitude follows the same pattern as that outlined in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "the result is a model containing the sm on the 3-branes and no unacceptable ( _ i.e. , _ unobserved ) low energy degrees of freedom .",
    "this is accomplished by allowing the group theoretical chan - paton factors as free parameters .",
    "the masses of gauge bosons @xmath17 and @xmath18 must be introduced by hand , since the string amplitude describes massless particle scattering and we are not consistently modeling the breaking of gauge invariance .",
    "though all the standard model gauge couplings are assumed to unify to a single value at the string scale in this simple construction , we use the physical values of the sm electroweak couplings since we restrict ourselves here to energies below the string scale .",
    "we begin with the general form for a four - fermion amplitude for open strings in such a braneworld framework .",
    "the parton level mandelstam variables are denoted by @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the physical scattering process will be identified as @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath22 and @xmath23-channels are labeled ( 1,2 ) , ( 1,4 ) and ( 1,3 ) , respectively .",
    "the ordered amplitude with the convention that all momenta are directed inward reads @xcite : @xmath24 \\\\ & \\times & \\left[\\frac{s(s , t)}{st } [ t(1234)+t(4321 ) ] + ( 1\\leftrightarrow 4 , s\\leftrightarrow u ) + ( 1\\leftrightarrow 2 , t\\leftrightarrow u)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the function @xmath25 is similar to a veneziano amplitude @xcite , and is defined by @xmath26 where the regge slope parameter @xmath27 . in the limit @xmath28 , @xmath29 and the low energy gauge theory expression for the amplitude is regained , as we show below .",
    "the factors @xmath30 and their @xmath31 and @xmath32 counterparts are proportional to the chan - paton factors @xcite and involve traces over the group representation matrices , @xmath33 , of the fermions at the four vertices .",
    "for example , @xmath34 with normalization @xmath35 in the adjoint representation of @xmath36",
    ". typically , with our normalization , the chan - paton factors are in the range of @xmath37 to @xmath38 for a general @xmath36 group .",
    "the above general expression serves as the basis for calculating all of the specific helicity and internal quantum number possibilities in the case that the states 3 and 4 have outgoing momenta .",
    "the charged current ( cc ) string model amplitude in the weak coupling regime receives no contribution from the graviton at one loop . in this sense",
    "it is perhaps conceptually cleaner than the neutral current ( nc ) case @xcite , where the graviton exchange is contained in the one loop amplitude @xcite . at energies above the string scale ,",
    "the extra power of @xmath12 in the graviton contribution compensates for the yang - mills gauge coupling suppression of the loop amplitude compared to the tree graphs ; there the strong gravity dynamics and the string resonance dynamics become comparable . though we are focusing on the low energy region , where graviton exchange is suppressed , the cc amplitude construction is simpler than that of the nc because there are fewer processes and only one gauge coupling to consider .",
    "for this reason we discuss the cc case first in some detail , and then turn to the nc case .    for definitiveness , taking all helicities for the in and out states left - handed ( denoted by @xmath39 ) , we find the string tree amplitude : @xmath40,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have further simplified notation by introducing @xmath41 and so forth .",
    "the corresponding standard model electroweak ( ew ) tree amplitude is @xmath42 here and henceforth , @xmath43 is identified with the @xmath44 gauge coupling .",
    "we require that the charged - current in @xmath45-channel contain the @xmath17 boson as its zero mode and that there is no exotic ( leptoquark ) zero mode in the @xmath23-channel . in order to remove the unwanted zero - mode pole , we must require @xmath46",

    "we define @xmath55 via eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) by @xmath56    the above results are also applicable to right - handed anti - fermion scattering @xmath57 .",
    "the other helicity combinations including anti - leptons and anti - quarks can be worked out by appropriate crossing .",
    "for instance , for the scattering of a left - handed lepton and a right - handed anti - quark @xmath58 , or right - handed anti - lepton on left - handed quark @xmath59 , the @xmath60 and @xmath61 crossed amplitude applies .",
    "the amplitudes for this process read @xmath62\\\\   & = &   a_{{string}}^{cc}(ll)(s\\leftrightarrow u ) =   ig^2\\frac{u}{t - m_{w}^2}\\overline{v}(s , t , u ) , \\label{eqvb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the generic label @xmath63 is not distinguished from that in the @xmath64 case above , to avoid clutter in the notation .",
    "these expressions are the analogs of those written down for the nc neutrino case in @xcite and @xcite , which we expand for the full range of nc cases in the next subsection .",
    "the open string perturbative amplitude construction for @xmath65 nc scattering follows exactly the same pattern as described above in the charged current case .",
    "the neutral current case involves 4-fermion amplitudes as well as 2-lepton plus 2-gluon external line amplitudes @xcite .",
    "we find that in the low energy realm the gluon amplitudes contribute negligibly to the constraints .",
    "therefore , we confine ourselves to the 4-fermion construction , again identifying zero - mode poles in the @xmath45-channel with @xmath66 and @xmath18-exchange . as before , we require that the chan - paton factors are constrained to cancel the exotic zero modes in the other channels . to introduce the sm factors",
    ", we adopt the device that fermion labels in the chan - paton factors are the guide to constructing the low energy limit .",
    "this is because the @xmath33 s of the external legs depend on the @xmath67 embedding in a larger ( unifying ) group , and the chan - paton traces over @xmath33 s are linked to the quantum numbers of the @xmath68 and @xmath23-channels .",
    "the connection between the string amplitude zero mode poles and the sm poles , in keeping with this philosophy , is described next .",
    "we consider separately the low energy matching for @xmath69 amplitudes for ( 1 ) all left - handed ( @xmath39 ) or all right - handed ( @xmath70 ) ; and ( 2 ) @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the string and sm electroweak tree amplitudes for the like - helicity combinations are @xmath73 where @xmath74 are the electric charge of quark and lepton ; @xmath75 matching with @xmath76 gives @xmath77 which guarantees that there is no zero - mode exotic @xmath23-channel pole and that the sm tree amplitude is recovered in the limit @xmath78 where @xmath79 . because the string models have nothing to say about the electroweak symmetry breaking , we put the effect in by hand in our treatment .",
