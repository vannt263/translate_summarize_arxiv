    "the inverted pendulum , more precisely its stabilization mechanisms deserve a lot of attention from several correlated areas , including physics , mathematics , biology , ( see for example an interesting review ibrahim2006 ) .",
    "however , the applications goes beyond , including the study of excitation effects in ocean structures @xcite , inverted pendulum robots @xcite and many others .",
    "induced stability is a solved problem known since 1908 @xcite , but it was in the 1950s , with kapiza @xcite , that this kind of stability was studied for the inverted pendulum system .",
    "experimental results were obtained in the 1960s ( see for example @xcite ) and even nowadays this problem still remains interesting @xcite .",
    "the possible excitations / perturbations which may be capable of stabilizing an inverted pendulum , even for some time , have a large number of details which are not completely understood yet .",
    "therefore , this apparent simple system , has a complexity that can be considered a challenging problem since some important stabilization problems in engineering , as for instance , the stability of robot arms , the stability of populations in biology ibrahim2006 , or even the stabilization of photons deviation in cosmology @xcite require similar stabilization mechanisms .    an inverted pendulum ( showin in fig .",
    "[ fig : inverted_pendulum ] ) free of external forces , is unstable and the punctual mass @xmath4 attached to the rigid massless rod will tend to oscillate around to the stable equilibrium position ( @xmath5 ) , which corresponds to the usual pendulum problem ) .    in order to keep the pendulum upright , @xmath6 , the frictionless hinge that attaches the rod to the suspension point point , must vertically accelerated .",
    "let us denote such acceleration by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a time - dependent excitation that controls the height of the pendulum suspension point @xmath9 .",
    "the lagrangian of this problem can easily be written as:@xmath10it is worth emphasizing that all our results can be directly extended to an equivalent physical pendulum making simple associations . if we additionally consider a external excitation @xmath11 we can derive the motion equation    @xmath12    from the lagrange equations .",
    "now , in order to generalize , we write @xmath13 and @xmath14 where subscripts det  and rand  denote the deterministic and stochastic time - dependent parts of the excitations / perturbations respectively . in this work",
    ", we focus our analysis in two important situations : @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xmath17 , i.e. , parametric sinusoidal excitation in the basis and @xmath18 and @xmath19 that denotes an external gaussian noise with mean @xmath20 and standard deviation @xmath21 .",
    "the more appropriate choice here is @xmath22 , given that we are mainly interested in the parametric stabilization of the inverted pendulum or in what we can call its survival time @xmath23 , which means the maximum time the pendulum remains upright or , mathematically , the time up to condition @xmath24 is satisfied .",
    "the condition @xmath25 leads to a natural biased motion , which is not interesting here . in this work",
    "we consider to analyze how the stability condition is broken as function of the external noise dispersion @xmath21 .",
    "several authors @xcite have explored the case @xmath1 using small angles approximation known as the effective potential method . however , even the well known case for one cosine , @xmath1 , deserves , in our opinion , some attention and alternative analysis .",
    "therefore , firstly , we checked the literature based on numerical integration methods in order to verify the validity of previous results in the small oscillations regime and the initial conditions dependence , basically , the initial angle dependence .",
    "particularly we also use these numerical integrations to observe the breaking of the stability region predicted by perturbative analysis and by parametric resonance ( see butikov @xcite ) when the external noise is turned on ( i.e. , @xmath26 ) . in this case",
    "we calculate the pendulum survival probability over different time evolutions ( i.e , different evolutions corresponding to different seeds ) .",
    "a detailed connection between @xmath27 and @xmath28 is also explored when the pendulum amplitude grows linearly with time and is also rescaled with the number of cosines set in the parametric excitation .    in the second part of this work",
    "we analyze the superposition of two cosines , @xmath2 , which as far as we are concerned has not been explored yet .",
    "this case is interesting since the period of the composition is not always known so that the perturbative analysis is not able to describe the inverted pendulum stability regions correctly",
    ". given such a problem , we analyze numerically the interesting case where the amplitudes are fixed and the frequencies : @xmath29and @xmath30 are varied .",
    "the analytical results obtained via the effective potential method are compared with numerical simulations .",
    "we also analyze the effects of an analysis of the stability breakdown considering different external noise dispersion @xmath21 in the numerical diagrams .",
    "deviations from small oscillations behavior were considered in our analysis .    finally , for @xmath3 , we look for optimization problems on the stability probability considering an ensemble of frequencies and amplitudes . the most remarkable detail in our analysis is the fact a simple choice for the stability criterion as , @xmath6 , overcomes more laborious methods such as liapunov exponent or other analysis to check stability conditions .",
    "so we organized our papers as it follows : in the next section we describe key points for a perturbative analysis extending our formulation for arbitrary @xmath0 , which is known in literature as effective potential method . in section [ section : numerical simulations ] , we briefly show our numerical simulations were developed .",
    "our main results are presented in section [ section : results ] .",
    "some discussions and conclusions are finally presented in section [ section : conclusions ] .",
    "we start our perturbative analysis by chosing the perturbative function @xmath31 , so that the eq .",
    "[ complete ] becomes @xmath32where we set up @xmath33 for all @xmath34 .",
    "the last equation can be written in a more elucidative form as @xmath35where @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the physical interpretation is straightforward here , given that @xmath38 is the gravitational potential , while @xmath39 is an external force due to vibrations at the pendulum suspension point . in what follows from here",
    ", we will adapt the equations obtained by landau and lifchitz @xcite .",
    "a similar analysis was developed by kapitza ( 1951 ) @xcite .",
    "we start assuming that the solution of eq .",
    "[ eq : movement ] can be separated into two aditive components : @xmath40we are considering that the pendulum motion is composed by a non - perturbated path @xmath41 plus a noise @xmath42 composed by multiple frequencies @xmath43and amplitudes @xmath44 .",
    "another way to think is that @xmath45 has a large amplitude but slow frequency while @xmath46 has small amplitude but fast frequency .    by the taylor expansions of @xmath38 and",
    "@xmath39 around the slow path @xmath41 , we have : @xmath47    considering these approximations up to the first order term , we can obtain from eq .",
    "[ eq : movement ] that @xmath48    now it is crucial to consider the nature of motion to distinguish the important terms in eq .",
    "[ eq : non - perturbated_oscilating ] .",
    "the only candidates associated with the perturbative effects on the right side of this equation are @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , given that the terms @xmath52 and @xmath53 are small when compared with @xmath50 we have @xmath54    by integrating the equation [ eq : dupla_derivada_epsilon ] twice with respect to time we obtain @xmath55    here , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are arbitrary constants and must be assumed null given that we want @xmath42 to be an oscillatory term , so that it should not increase as a function of time .",
    "this is a constraint that can be imposed as initial condition . for a set @xmath43 the superposition @xmath58 does not necessarily results in a periodic function . for this to occur",
    ", there must be a period @xmath59 , such that : @xmath60 and @xmath61 , for every pair @xmath62 , or simply @xmath63i.e .",

    "let us focus our analysis only in situations where this condition is satisfied .",
    "it is important to recall this is a problem for which an analytical solution is not typically known .",
    "therefore , our aim here is to derive a stability criteria given our choices for the perturbative functions . in order to do that , we start taking a time average of eq .",

    "this case has been widely studied under different analysis @xcite , @xcite . when @xmath1 , the result from eq .",

    "unfortunately , it represents only one part of the history since there is a upper bound for the amplitude that can be observed by numerical simulations .",
    "this is the simplest case where the perturbative analysis can not be rigorously applied to all possible situations since the periodicity of the superposition @xmath77 depends on certain restrictions . as it will be shown in section [ section : results ] , this case becomes particularly interesting when the amplitudes are set equal , that is , @xmath78 .",

    "however , for certain ranges of frequencies , stabilization can be attained for amplitudes @xmath83 that are slightly smaller .      for an important and trivial case",

    "however this favorable effect soon becomes undesirable since this monotonically increasing amplitude will dominates the scenario leading to a loss of stability .",
    "therefore , the real important question to be made here is whether the system is capable of keeping the memory of stabilization according to eq .",
    "[ eq : maximum ] under this amplitude normalization procedure .",
    "we will show numerically in section section : results that such condition is preserved .",
