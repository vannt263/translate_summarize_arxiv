    "the observed anisotropy and polarisation of the cosmic microwave background radiation give very precise information about the cosmic history since last scattering . using a simple physical model",
    ", we can determine cosmological parameters with very high accuracy and also learn about structure formation and reionisation .",
    "nevertheless , it is still difficult to obtain information about the universe before big bang nucleosynthesis without making many extra assumptions . in this context , primordial black holes ( pbhs )",
    "could be one of the most important fossils of the very early universe .",
    "such black holes may have formed directly from primordial density perturbations  @xcite and may contribute to the cosmological @xmath1-ray background radiation , the cosmic ray flux and the dark matter density .",
    "this leads to important observational constraints on the number of pbhs  @xcite and hence on models of the very early universe .    to understand these constraints",
    ", it is important to know whether pbhs can accrete enough to become much more massive than they were at formation .",
    "this topic has a long history .",
    "it was originally claimed , on the basis of a simple newtonian argument , that a pbh much smaller than the cosmological particle horizon at formation would not accrete much at all , whereas one comparable to the horizon size would continue to grow at the same rate as the horizon until the end of the radiation - dominated era  @xcite . since one would _",
    "expect _ a pbh to be of order the particle horizon size at formation in order to collapse against the pressure , this suggests that all pbhs might grow to the horizon mass at the end of the radiation era , which is about @xmath2 solar masses .",
    "since there is no evidence for such enormous black holes in the universe today , the conclusion seemed to be that pbhs never formed .",
    "however , this conclusion was very suspect .",
    "if pbhs really could grow as fast as the particle horizon , there would have to exist spherically symmetric self - similar solutions to einstein s equations containing black holes in an exact friedmann background .",
    "a study of solutions of this kind containing radiation ( i.e. fluid with equation of state @xmath3 ) showed that there are no self - similar pbh solutions if the black hole is formed by purely local processes ( i.e. if the background is exactly friedmann beyond some radius ) .",
    "self - similar solutions are possible only if the initial perturbation of the friedmann background extends to infinity  @xcite . since the pbh must soon become much smaller than the cosmological horizon , at which point the newtonian argument _ should _ be applicable , this suggests that it will only increase its mass by a small amount .",
    "this conclusion was subsequently extended to more general fluids , with an equation of state of the form @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "although there was an initial claim that self - similar growth might be possible in the special case of a stiff fluid ( @xmath0 )  @xcite , this claim was subsequently challenged  @xcite .",
    "it was found to be true only in rather contrived circumstances in which the stiff fluid is converted into radiation at the black hole s event horizon .",
    "therefore the conclusion that there are no self - similar solutions containing pbhs formed by purely local processes seems to be true very generally .",
    "see  @xcite for a review of self - similar solutions .",
    "this conclusion is also confirmed by numerical calculations . if the formation and evolution of a pbh in a general fluid universe with a local perturbation is simulated numerically , without assuming self - similarity , it is found that the pbh soon becomes much smaller than the cosmological horizon and this excludes self - similar growth  @xcite .",
    "more recently , pbh formation from density perturbations has been investigated in the context of critical phenomena  @xcite but again with no evidence for self - similar growth .",
    "hitherto studies of pbhs have mainly focused on perfect fluid universes with equation of state @xmath5 .",
    "however , it is also natural to consider a universe whose density is dominated by a scalar field .",
    "for example , in the chaotic inflation scenario it is postulated that there is a pre - inflationary stage in which the scalar field moves randomly in space and time . in the pre - heating inflationary scenario , it is also natural to consider a scalar - field - dominated era  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the study of pbhs in the quintessence scenario has attracted attention  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to examine whether the conclusion that pbh accretion is small also applies in this case .",
    "if the scalar field is massless and there is no scalar potential , then it is well known  @xcite that it is equivalent to a stiff fluid providing the gradient of the scalar field remains timelike , as usually applies .",
    "the fact that there is no self - similar solution in the stiff case therefore suggests that accretion is also limited in the scalar field case . despite this , the original newtonian argument for self - similar growth has recently been applied in the quintessence scenario to argue that pbhs could grow enough to form the supermassive black holes found in galactic nuclei  @xcite .",
    "a generalization of this analysis  @xcite , not necessarily involving self - similarity but still based on the newtonian analysis , has also claimed there could be appreciable quintessence accretion in some circumstances .",
    "both these analyses contravene the conclusions of the earlier work discussed above .",
    "however , since the earlier work did not strictly include the scalar field case and did not allow for a scalar potential , a more careful analysis is required before concluding that these analyses are erroneous .",
    "scalar fields are also relevant in brans - dicke and scalar - tensor theories of gravity , where the gravitational `` constant '' varies in space and time .",
    "this is because , if there is a single gravitational scalar field , such theories can be transformed into the usual einstein gravity with a single scalar field  @xcite .",
    "brans - dicke and scalar - tensor theories are particularly relevant to pbhs since the black holes may form when @xmath6 was very different from today .",
    "indeed the `` gravitational memory '' scenario has been proposed  @xcite , in which the value of @xmath6 within the black hole is assumed to be preserved as the cosmological background value evolves .",
    "the observational constraints on pbhs depend strongly on whether or not one has gravitational memory  @xcite .",
    "it is not clear whether this applies but , if it does , it should be due to the properties of the black hole event horizon rather than those of the matter fields involved .",
    "it is interesting that the problem of gravitational memory is also closely related to the problem of accretion  @xcite .",
    "this is because it turns out that appreciable accretion of the scalar field energy is required for gravitational memory to be preserved and so the issue of whether there is a self - similar solution again becomes relevant . indeed",
    "carr and goymer argued that there is unlikely to be gravitational memory on the grounds that there is no self - similar solution in the stiff fluid case  @xcite .",
    "evidence against the gravitational memory scenario , at least in particular situations , has also been obtained using other arguments  @xcite .    as a first step to investigating these questions numerically , in this paper we consider a universe containing a massless scalar field but no matter . to implement the simulations",
    ", we use a double - null formulation of the einstein equations based on the work by hamad and stewart  @xcite .",
    "this has been shown to be a very powerful tool for investigating critical collapse  @xcite and the internal structure of black holes  @xcite .",
    "this study represents an improvement on earlier work  @xcite , in which the gravitational effect of the scalar field was neglected , since it uses the full field equations .",
    "it should also be seen in conjunction with two other papers  @xcite ; we consider general constraints on the size of a pbh at formation in the first and some effects associated with very large pbhs in the second .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the double - null formulation and present the basic equations for the scalar field case . in section iii ,",
    "we discuss how we set up the initial data for the simulations .",
    "section iv presents our results , with particular emphasis on the evolution of the black hole event horizon and the spatial profile of the scalar field . in section",
    "v , we discuss the implications of these results for the accretion and gravitational memory issues , also considering the applicability of the newtonian accretion formula . in section",
    "vi , we draw some general conclusions . details of the numerical code and particular exact solutions are described in appendices .",
    "we adopt units in which @xmath7 and the abstract index notation of reference  @xcite .",
    "we consider a massless scalar field in general relativity , for which the stress - energy tensor is @xmath8 the einstein equations are @xmath9 and the equation of motion for the scalar field is @xmath10 we also focus on a spherically symmetric system , for which the line element can be written in the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are advanced and retarded time coordinates , respectively , and @xmath14 is the `` area radius '' ( the proper area of the sphere of constant @xmath14 being @xmath15 ) . eqs .",
    "( [ eq : einstein ] ) and ( [ eq : eom ] ) then imply that we have 14 first - order partial differential equations and two auxiliary equations ( see section 2 of  @xcite ) . by adopting a double - null coordinate choice",
    ", we can simulate regions outside the cosmological apparent horizon and inside the black hole apparent horizon simultaneously .    in spherically symmetric spacetimes the existence and position of apparent horizons",
    "can be inferred from the form of the hawking mass .",
    "this is a well - behaved quasi - local mass , which can be written as @xmath16 using the above equation and eq .",
    "( 2.6 ) of  @xcite , we can derive the following useful relations : @xmath17 a region is trapped if @xmath18 and @xmath19 , while it is antitrapped if @xmath20 and @xmath21 . the black hole and cosmological apparent horizons",
    "are defined as marginally trapped and anti - trapped surfaces , respectively . providing the black hole horizon is within the cosmological horizon , these correspond to the conditions @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "thus the relation @xmath24 is satisfied on both apparent horizons because @xmath25 there .",
    "we confine attention to this situation in the present paper . however , as discussed in a separate paper  @xcite , in some circumstances the black hole horizon can be outside the cosmological horizon and the situation is then more complicated . in this case",
    ", we can still use two different marginal surfaces on which @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "however , these are no longer everywhere identified with the black hole and cosmological apparent horizons .",
    "note that the black hole and cosmological apparent horizons are distinct from the black hole event horizon and cosmological particle horizon , which are always null . for numerical purposes ,",
    "the apparent horizons are easier to find than the event and particle horizons because the complete spacetime , including the initial singularity , is needed to identify the latter , whereas the former can be found from the quasi - local properties of spacetime alone .",
    "however , we will also discuss the behaviour of the black hole event horizon in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we first consider the flat friedmann model , for which @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are given explicitly in terms of the standard double null coordinates in appendix  [ sec : exact_solutions ] .",
    "the condition @xmath24 implies that the cosmological apparent horizon is @xmath29 and this implies that its radius is just the hubble scale @xmath30 in a flat friedmann universe , as described in  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the cosmological particle horizon is clearly @xmath31 , corresponding to a photon propagating outwards from the big bang .",
    "this implies that the apparent horizon is always outside the particle horizon and the conformal diagram of the spacetime is as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : flat_friedmann ] .",
    "this also shows the initial ( big bang ) spacelike singularity .",
    "if one perturbs such a spacetime but without introducing a black hole , the conformal diagram remains the same but the trajectories of constant space and time coordinate change .",
    "if one has a black hole embedded in an exact or asymptotically flat friedmann model , the conformal diagram will change to the form indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbh ] .",
    "there are now also a black hole event horizon and apparent horizon , although one can not give explicit analytic expressions for these , and a final ( black hole ) spacelike singularity .",
    "if we define time and space coordinates , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , by @xmath34 we can put the 2-dimensional part of the metric tensor into conformally flat form . as in the usual 3 + 1 approach",
    ", we define the energy density @xmath35 and momentum density @xmath36 measured by an observer moving normal to the @xmath37 spacelike hypersurface by @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are unit vectors parallel to @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "it should be stressed that the above description is observer - dependent and one can adopt another point of view .",
    "providing the scalar field is vorticity - free and has a timelike gradient , it is equivalent to a perfect fluid with a `` stiff '' equation of state @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the stress - energy tensor is then @xmath43 where the energy density @xmath44 and the 4-velocity @xmath45 of the stiff fluid are @xmath46 it should be noted that the 4-velocity of the stiff fluid is parallel to the ( timelike ) gradient of the scalar field .",
    "we can define an observer - independent velocity function by @xmath47 this being the rate of increase of @xmath14 per unit proper time @xmath48 along the worldline of the equivalent stiff fluid element .",
    "appendix  [ sec : basic_equations ] gives expressions for these physical quantities in terms of the quantities calculated numerically .",
    "the initial data are prescribed on the outgoing null surface @xmath49 and the ingoing null surface @xmath50 .",
    "the region of calculation is the diamond @xmath51\\times [ v_{0},v_{1}]$ ] shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : pbh ] .",
    "we have three independent functions on the two null surfaces : @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath14 .",
    "two of them can be chosen freely and the other one is determined by the initial value equations on the null surfaces .",
    "it is convenient to choose @xmath54 as the free initial data and to regard @xmath55 as being determined by the initial value equations .",
    "we can regard @xmath56 and @xmath57 as the physical degrees of freedom in the initial data , while the choice for @xmath58 and @xmath59 fixes the gauge .",
    "it is usually assumed that the perturbation from which the pbh forms is local , so that the universe is exactly friedmann at sufficiently large distances . since information propagates at the speed of light",
    ", the matching between the perturbed and flat friedmann regions always corresponds to some outgoing null ray @xmath60 and such a ray is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : local_perturbation ] .",
    "this means that the region outside the matching surface @xmath61 is always described by the flat friedmann solution . on the outgoing null surface @xmath49 , we therefore assume that the initial data are given by the flat friedmann solution for @xmath62 . on the ingoing null surface @xmath50 , we assume they are given by the flat friedmann solution for @xmath63 but by some perturbation of it for @xmath64 , where an appropriate matching is implemented at @xmath61 . as described in the next section , the perturbed region contains a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "however , since this is a vacuum solution , it only applies instantaneously at @xmath50 because the inflowing matter will fill the vacuum immediately .",
    "if the perturbation is assumed to be local , we can derive various upper limits on the black hole size  @xcite .",
    "these are generally within the cosmological particle horizon , which would then correspond to the line @xmath31 in fig .",
    "[ fig : local_perturbation ] .",
    "however , a perturbation can be larger than the cosmological particle horizon in some circumstances  indeed most of the cases we consider in this paper have this feature .",
    "the particle horizon is then within the perturbed region and no longer given by @xmath31 . in some circumstances , e.g. for quantum fluctuations resulting from inflation",
    ", the perturbation may extend indefinitely , or at least well beyond the usual particle horizon .",
    "generally the only upper limit on the size of the perturbation comes from the requirement that the the perturbed region must be part of our universe rather a separate closed universe .",
    "the condition for this has been derived precisely for the situation in which the collapsing region is homogeneous and the equation of state is @xmath5  @xcite . in this case , the closed - universe scale is always well beyond the cosmological apparent horizon size .",
    "even if the perturbed region is within our universe , the solution may exhibit anomalous features if it is too large .",
    "these anomalies are described elsewhere  @xcite but we do not choose initial data which lead them to arise in this paper .      in the flat friedmann region , we choose the coordinate system given in appendix  [ subsec : flat_friedmann ] .",
    "we also impose flat friedmann initial data for @xmath52 and @xmath53 on the initial outgoing null surface @xmath49 with @xmath62 .",

    "note that one has a schwarzschild vacuum for @xmath80 .",
    "however , as noted above , this situation only applies instantaneously at @xmath81 , since the vacuum will be filled with the scalar field at any later or earlier time .",
    "nevertheless , one expects the event horizon to evolve smoothly , so it will still be described by a single null line , as illustrated qualitatively in fig .",
    "[ fig : local_perturbation ]    to summarise , two parameters describe the initial conditions : the location of the matching surface and the smoothing length .",
    "the region outside the matching surface is the exact flat friedmann solution , so the first parameter determines the mass of the perturbed region .",
    "the second parameter determines the mass of the black hole compared to the perturbed mass .",
    "a small smoothing length means a narrow boundary between the exterior friedmann region and the interior vacuum region . in this case , the mass inside the vacuum region is nearly the same as that within the matching surface and so a large mass is concentrated at the central singularity .",
    "a large smoothing length means a wide boundary , so the mass inside the vacuum region is much smaller than this and so a small mass is concentrated at the central singularity . for vanishing smoothing length , the black hole mass would be the same as that at the matching surface , so @xmath82 would also be the black hole event horizon , although it is difficult to implement this numerically because of the strong discontinuity .",
    "the numerical code is based on hamad and stewart  @xcite , although it is slightly modified so as to be accurate to second - order ( see appendix  [ sec : basic_equations ] ) . as indicated in fig .",

    "the values @xmath83 and @xmath84 fix the units . for example , the background value for the hubble parameter at @xmath89 is 4 and the hubble length becomes 0.25 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : hubble ] ) . the value of @xmath90 is always taken to be 1.1 but @xmath91 varies between 2 and 4 . on the initial ingoing null surface , we make the matching at three values of @xmath70 in the range @xmath92 to 0 .",
    "we also use small and large smoothing lengths , corresponding to @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "as shown in appendix  [ subsec : flat_friedmann ] , the cosmological apparent and particle horizons are given by @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively , in the flat friedmann model .",
    "as time proceeds , the outgoing null rays will become ever more sensitive to @xmath14 near the black hole event horizon , so the calculation is stopped at the value of @xmath13 at which the outgoing null rays near the black hole event horizon become too coarse to resolve .",

    "b and c , the accretion rate starts with its maximum value and then monotonically decreases .",

    "this feature is a purely general relativistic effect and there is no analogue in newtonian gravity .",
    "it can be understood physically as arising because the scalar field must be partaking in the cosmic expansion at sufficiently large distances , rather than accreting onto the black hole . since the sound speed is the speed of light for a scalar field , the cosmological apparent horizon is likely to be the transition point . a more rigorous explanation of this effect is presented in section v , where it is shown to apply for more general fluids .",
    "we conclude that , even if a pbh starts off as large as the cosmological apparent horizon , it soon gets considerably smaller than it .",
    "whatever the initial size of the pbh , accretion can be large only for about a hubble time , after which it becomes ineffective .",
    "as seen in tables  [ tb : radii ] and [ tb : masses ] , the mass increase is at most 79 % for our models .",

    "the prediction of a large accretion rate also conflicts with the results of our simulations . since the cosmological time is given by @xmath142^{3/2}$ ] for the flat friedmann solution ( see appendix  [ subsec : flat_friedmann ] )",
    ", the self - similar growth of a black hole would imply that its mass grew like @xmath143 .",
    "the black hole mass accretion rate @xmath144 should therefore be proportional to @xmath145 .",
    "however , the results of our simulations show that the accretion rate decreases after reaching a maximum . we conclude that there is no evidence for a trend towards self - similar evolution , which contradicts the argument  @xcite that a black hole can grow as fast as the universe through accreting a quintessence field .",
    "it also provides a counterexample to the proposal that a spherically symmetric spacetime always evolves towards self - similarity  @xcite .",
    "it order to determine the accuracy of the newtonian accretion formula more precisely , we now derive an exact relativistic formula for the accretion rate . because the event horizon is given by an outgoing null surface @xmath146 , the time variation of the black hole mass is governed by eq .",

    "( [ eq : exactaccrete ] ) also explains why the mass accretion rate starts low for models a and d. since the black hole event horizon is inside but very close to the cosmological apparent horizon in these cases , @xmath159 is negative but very close to zero . after a while",
    ", however , @xmath159 falls well below zero and then the mass accretion increases . the suppression of the accretion by the factor @xmath159 on the right - hand side of eq .",

    "the situation is simplified because @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 . as a result",
    ", we can immediately conclude that the black hole accretion vanishes when its event horizon coincides with the cosmological apparent horizon , since @xmath23 there .",
    "it can be easily proved that the black hole mass is non - decreasing if @xmath21 , @xmath18 and if the dominant energy condition holds on the event horizon ( see proposition 5 of @xcite ) . however ,",
    "if these assumptions are not satisfied , the mass variation of the black hole event horizon is non - trivial . in particular",
    ", one finds that the black hole mass is decreasing when it is outside the cosmological apparent horizon , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "this possibility is studied in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that hayward  @xcite introduced the future ( past ) outer trapping horizon as a more general and useful concept than the black hole ( white hole ) event horizon .",
    "when the black hole ( white hole ) horizon is defined in this way , he also proved the monotonicity of the area and quasi - local mass in the spherically symmetric situation .",
    "the brans - dicke theory with empty stress - energy tensor can be transformed into the einstein theory with a massless scalar field by a conformal transformation even when the brans - dicke parameter @xmath164 is of order unity  @xcite .",
    "this is also the case in scalar - tensor theories of gravity if there is a single massless gravitational scalar field .",
    "the transformed frame with the einstein - hilbert action is called the einstein frame , in contrast to the original physical frame .",
    "the gravitational constant varies in space and time in the physical frame and is actually a function of the massless scalar field @xmath53 in the einstein frame .",
    "since the conformal transformation does not affect the causal structure of the spacetime , the present simulation can be regarded as probing the evolution of pbhs in brans - dicke and scalar - tensor theories with empty stress - energy tensor .",
    "our results elucidate whether or not gravitational memory is physically reasonable  @xcite .",
    "we have seen that the scalar field evolution near and even inside the black hole event horizon follows the cosmological evolution .",
    "moreover , the gradient of the scalar field is always timelike .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the evolution of the physical gravitational constant near a pbh in brans - dicke and scalar - tensor theories essentially follows its asymptotic cosmological evolution .",
    "the fact that the gradient of the scalar field is timelike during the evolution also ensures the existence of a spacetime foliation with spacelike hypersurfaces , in which the physical gravitational constant is spatially constant .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the gravitational memory scenario is physically unrealistic even for pbhs whose size is comparable with the cosmological horizon .    using a perturbative test field analysis , jacobson  @xcite showed that black holes do not exhibit gravitational memory in scalar - tensor cosmology if they are much smaller than the cosmological horizon .",
    "numerical studies for a test scalar field in the pbh dust solution by harada , goymer and carr  @xcite showed that there is no gravitational memory even for black holes whose size is comparable to the cosmological horizon scale , so long as the back reaction of the scalar field on the metric can be neglected . in the present work",
    "we have extended this result by considering the case where the black hole size is comparable to the cosmological horizon scale and the gravitational effect of the scalar field is included .",
    "once the black hole horizon gets much smaller than the cosmological horizon scale , the approximation made by jacobson will apply .",
    "taken together , these results suggest that the gravitational memory scenario is a highly unphysical , at least in brans - dicke and scalar - tensor theories .",
    "we have investigated the evolution of a pbh in a flat friedmann universe with a massless scalar field by numerically integrating the einstein field equations using the double - null formulation .",
    "we have considered models in which a schwarzschild interior and a friedmann exterior are initially matched at a finite radius with some smoothing length . for pbhs which are initially the same size as or smaller than the cosmological apparent horizon , the black hole event horizon soon becomes smaller than the cosmological horizon scale . the black hole apparent horizon forms inside the black hole event horizon but asymptotes towards it .",
    "the scalar field evolution qualitatively follows the cosmological evolution close to the black hole event horizon and even inside it .",
    "the field maintains a timelike gradient and is therefore always equivalent to a stiff fluid . in terms of the stiff fluid description ,",
    "the energy density in the perturbed region decreases homogeneously in time and the infall velocity profile near the black hole becomes almost stationary after a short while .",
    "our results show that , soon after the pbh enters the cosmological apparent horizon , it becomes isolated from the cosmological expansion , with only a very small amount of mass accretion from the non - vacuum exterior",
    ". the accretion can be significant at first but soon decreases and becomes insignificant .",
    "in particular , our simulations exhibit no self - similar growth of the pbh .",
    "this is consistent with earlier work , which proved the non - existence of self - similar pbh solutions for a stiff fluid with an exact flat friedmann exterior .",
    "the present result also indicates that the gravitational memory scenario for pbhs is unphysical in brans - dicke and scalar - tensor theories of gravity .",
