    "an effective field theory  @xcite of dark matter can systematically describe the effects of heavy , non - propagating mediators between the dark sector and the standard model .",
    "in particular for light dark matter with @xmath0 , an effective lagrangian can describe the effects of heavier mediators  @xcite , always assuming @xmath1 the corresponding effective lagrangian then includes a new physics scale @xmath2 and the corresponding coupling @xmath3 .",
    "this description is generally accepted for processes with a low external energy scale and provided the effective lagrangian expansion does not interfere with the velocity suppression .",
    "this includes dark matter annihilation in the early universe  @xcite , dark matter annihilation with decay products observed today  @xcite , or direct dark matter searches based on scattering with nuclei  @xcite .",
    "issues with this picture occur for dark matter production at the lhc  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we attempt a comprehensive , quantitative study of the limitations of an effective theory of dark matter .",
    "the main question is _ if an effective theory can be used to link very different observations as part of a global dark matter analysis , and if in this link it correctly represents the patterns of a full model behind it . _ from detailed studies of effective theories in the higgs sector at the lhc  @xcite we know that simple arguments based on dimensional analysis and scale estimates  @xcite are not always well - suited for lhc physics .",
    "instead , we should establish the ( non-)applicability of effective theory approximations model - by - model and observable - by - observable  @xcite .",
    "obviously , we will focus on standard lhc processes as the limiting factors .",
    "we will study mono - jet or related signatures , where the relevant observables are the transverse momentum distribution of the missing particles recoiling against one or more jets and , to some degree , the total rate .",
    "the only additional ingredient we will use is the relic density as a rough guideline if our model for the dark sector could be responsible for the observed dark matter density  @xcite .",
    "all models in our study will include simple dark matter sectors , allowing for a straightforward test if an observed missing energy signal is likely to be related to the dark matter relic density in our universe .",
    "the reasoning behind this link is that from a practical perspective the lhc either adds some relevant piece of information to a global dark matter analysis  or the question if the lhc observable is well described by the effective lagrangian is irrelevant .",
    "to get an idea what kind of thermal dark matter signal we would be looking for at the lhc , we can estimate the observed relic density , for example assuming the usual @xmath4 annihilation process mediated by a dimension-6 operator @xmath5 we will at least roughly let the observed relic density guide us through the dark sector s parameter space .",
    "typically , the above scaling gives us a lower limit on the ratio @xmath6 , an upper limit on the mediator mass , or a lower limit on lhc production cross sections .",
    "the rough relation between the mediator and dark matter masses is @xmath7 in this simple model the dark matter agent can be very light , but the mediator will typically be heavy . for weakly interacting models",
    "the appropriate dark matter and mediator mass scales will decrease .",
    "similarly , if we only require our dark matter agent to be responsible for part of the observed relic density , the annihilation cross section can be larger , or the mass scales can be ( slightly ) smaller .    just as a side remark , for an @xmath8-channel mediator with the pole condition @xmath9 the annihilation rate scales like @xmath10 , introducing the width as an additional scale and strongly reducing the required couplings .",
    "we will not follow this well - known path in higgs portal scenarios and instead study generic @xmath4 annihilation processes .",
    "additional external energy scales are introduced by the hadron collider environment of a given dark matter process , now leading to three relevant energy scales @xmath11 for dark matter annihilation , indirect detection , and direct detection these additional energy scales are no challenge to the validity of the effective theory . at the lhc",
    "the situation is less obvious , because kinematic cuts or a potential kinematic link between the mediator mass @xmath12 and the energy transfer can push the momentum transfer of the process to energy scales @xmath13 .",
    "one promising , general dark matter search targets jet production with a pair of dark matter particles .",
    "the key observables here are the @xmath14 and @xmath15 distributions . for simple hard processes the two transverse momentum distributions are rapidly dropping and strongly correlated .",
    "they define the relevant energy scales @xmath16 the experimentally relevant @xmath14 or @xmath15 regime is given by a combination of the signal mass scale , the kinematics of the dominant @xmath17+jets background , and triggering .",
    "our effective theory has to reproduce two key observables , @xmath18 the latter over the relevant phase space regime .",
    "these two lhc observables will guide us through the different models in our study .",
    "finally , the hadronic lhc energy of 13  tev , combined with reasonable parton momentum fractions defines an absolute upper limit , above which for example a particle in the @xmath8-channel can not be produced as a propagating state .",
    "this adds another energy scale to our setup , @xmath19 these four scales define the framework of our effective theory considerations at the lhc .",
    "as described above , any effective theory description of dark matter relies on some fundamental assumptions on the new physics spectrum .",
    "for example , if the hierarchy in eq .",
    "is inverted , @xmath20 the effective theory is often not applicable .",
    "we can instead describe dark matter annihilation and production through a simplified model with a dynamic mediator field  @xcite .",
    "the relic density becomes largely independent of the light mediator mass , and the usual wimp condition gives the dark matter mass through @xmath21 the phenomenology of such a model can be illustrated with the higgs portal story : the light mediator will be produced directly , and it will decay to two light standard model states through its production coupling .",
    "a decay to two dark matter agents will only occur for off - shell mediator production and will be strongly suppressed .",
    "in other words , the lhc we will look for light new resonances , and this signature will not allow us to identify the mediator nature of this state or say anything about dark matter .",
    "in terms of lhc energy scales this situation reads more specifically @xmath22 the mediator appears as the propagating degree of freedom at the lhc .",
    "the spin and quantum numbers of the mediator states play a significant role ; vector mediators can couple to light quarks  @xcite , while scalar mediators typically couple to top quarks  @xcite .",
    "sizeable light - quark couplings of scalar mediators in the @xmath8-channel are strongly constrained by flavor physics  @xcite .",
    "realistic scalar mediators arise from mixing with the sm higgs  @xcite .",
    "this scenario is strongly constrained by higgs physics , but allows for an electroweak mono - jet signal comparable in size to the qcd - induced mono - jet signal  @xcite .",
    "colored scalar mediators with @xmath23-channel interactions can have large , flavor - specific couplings , because the mediator is a triplet in flavor space  @xcite .",
    "while at the lhc the search for jets plus missing energy  or mono - jet signatures  is fully established , the nature of mediators can also be studied in a variety of mono - x final states ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "these rates are typically at least an order of magnitude smaller than mono - jet cross - sections . however , for gluon or photon radiation the up - type and down - type quark initial states do not interfere , and the sign of the relative couplings are irrelevant . in contrast , the mono-@xmath25 signature with opposite - sign couplings to up - type and down - type quarks can exceed the mono - jet signal for large transverse momenta  @xcite .",
    "this enhancement can be linked to an eventually unitarity - violating part of the amplitude  @xcite .",
    "a gauge - invariant implementation of such a model will be tamed by @xmath26 mixing , or more general new physics through higher - dimensional operators .",
    "similar , power - enhanced unitarity violation also exist in mono-@xmath27 and mono - higgs signatures for vector mediators with axial - vector couplings  @xcite .",
    "a logarithmic divergence exists in mono-@xmath27 production mediated through scalar mediators at one loop  @xcite .",
    "however , aside from mono-@xmath25 production , these divergences do not lead to actual problems at the lhc  @xcite , and mono - jet searches are still the key search strategy for mediators at the lhc .",
    "one dark matter scenario , inspired for example by supersymmetry , is a fermionic dark matter candidate combined with a scalar mediator .",
    "the mediator @xmath28 couples the dark matter fermion @xmath29 to an up - type quark , implying that it carries a color charge in the fundamental representation .",
    "any model for such a @xmath23-channel mediator has to assume at least two interactions , @xmath30 the first interaction has no structural counterpart in the standard model , so we are free to choose its size . in supersymmetric models",
    "it is fixed by the corresponding electroweak gauge or yukawa couplings  @xcite . because of this interaction the @xmath23-channel mediator always has to be heavier than then dark matter fermion",
    ", @xmath31 otherwise the dark matter agent decays .",
    "the second interaction occurs through the qcd part of the covariant derivative .",
    "the mediator will also have @xmath27 and @xmath32 interactions from the covariant derivative , but we assume them to be sub - leading at the lhc . in our very simple toy model",
    "the dark matter interaction is described by @xmath33 we assume @xmath34 , unless the value is specified . naively , the mono - jet production rate scales like @xmath35 .",
    "the mediator width becomes  @xcite @xmath36 as long as its coupling to sm fermions matches the flavor structure of the standard model , the @xmath23-channel mediator is a narrow resonance over our entire relevant parameter space .    from this lagrangian we can compute the relic density using feynrules  @xcite and micromegas  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : relic_tchannel ] we show the predicted relic density for different cuts in the two - dimensional dark matter vs mediator parameter space . in the left panel",
    "we see that for light dark matter the measured relic density requires a comparably light mediator within the reach of the lhc .",
    "the numbers are slightly different than in eq . because of the color factor @xmath37 in the annihilation rate . in the second panel",
    "we see that for too heavy mediators there is no dark matter mass which predicts the correct relic density .",
    "this occurs because the required dark matter mass becomes too large , eventually exceeding the mediator mass and leading to dark matter decay channels .",
    "finally , in the right panel we confirm the inverse quadratic scaling with a linked dark matter and mediator mass scale and the clear preference for ratios @xmath38 .",
    "in essence , the observed relic density is in accordance with an effective theory description of the @xmath23-channel mediator model .",
    "note that if we choose a smaller coupling , for example @xmath39 , the model will not give the correct relic density for parameter choices allowed by lhc .",

    "realistic mono - jet lhc searches require large @xmath14 , pushing the region where the eft gives a good lhc description to very heavy mediator masses .      for the @xmath23-channel mediator model it only makes sense to study the half plane with @xmath81 ; otherwise the dark matter agent would decay . because the @xmath23-channel mediator carries color charge , lhc constraints typically force us into the regime @xmath82  tev .",
    "in this situation the dark matter candidate must have a mass at least around 400 gev , to avoid over - closing the universe ; for the same reason the @xmath83 coupling should be larger than for example in supersymmetric realizations . both of these requirements point to a valid effective lagrangian .",
    "one issue with the @xmath23-channel model and its effective theory description at moderate mediator masses is the pair production process at the lhc . because the corresponding production rate does not include any information on the dark sector , an additional branching ratio will only become interesting when we expand the model to allow for two competing decays",
    "however , pair production decouples rapidly with a heavier mediator mass , leading into a regime where single - resonant production plays a more important role .",
    "the single - resonant production process is in principle described by the same effective theory as the generic @xmath23-channel diagrams . towards large mediator masses also",
    "the single - resonant topology decouples rapidly .",
    "again , this behavior does not signal problems for the effective theory , except for some issues in describing the transverse momentum distributions for still moderate mediator masses .",
    "the key problem of the @xmath23-channel model as well as its effective theory is that in the kinematically defined decoupling regime the dark matter annihilation rate and the lhc rates are both small .",
    "the model exceeds the measured relic density unless we postulate non - perturbative couplings .",
    "note , however , that this is not a problem caused by the effective lagrangian .",
    "it is a well - known problem with the @xmath23-channel mediator model , which for example in supersymmetric models is usually resurrected through co - annihilation .",

    "an alternative dark matter scenario is a typically fermionic dark matter candidate combined with a @xmath8-channel vector mediator @xmath84 . in supersymmetric models a similar mediator role",
    "is played by the standard model @xmath27-boson . in general , we need to postulate two interactions , @xmath85 these two couplings induce two competing mediator decays , into standard model particles and into dark matter .",
    "we assume the mediator to at least couple to quarks in the standard model , so we can test the model at the lhc ; a tree - level coupling to two gluons becomes a serious issue in setting up the model .",
    "there are three different mass regimes in the @xmath86 mass plane , @xmath87 this mass relation determines if the generic @xmath4 process @xmath88 factorizes into a @xmath89 kinematics or not . from the lhc perspective the upper two regimes lead to a phase space enhancement . for non - relativistic processes like dark matter annihilation ,",
    "a phase - space enhancement is limited to the on - shell case .",
    "this translates into small couplings predicting the correct relic density , essentially turning off all lhc signatures . for our effective theory considerations at the lhc",
    "we will therefore limit ourselves to the first case .",
    "the light mediator case is , in general , very interesting because its suppressed @xmath4 rate will include direct information on both mediator couplings .",

    "<S> an effective theory of dark matter offers an attractive framework for global analyses of dark matter . in the light of global fits we test the validity of the link between the non - relativistic dark matter annihilation , or the predicted relic density , and lhc signatures . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we study how well the effective theory describes the main features of simple models with s - channel and t - channel mediators coupling to the standard model at tree level or through one - loop diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that global dark matter analyses in terms of effective lagrangians are highly non - trivial to interpret in term of actual models . </S>"
