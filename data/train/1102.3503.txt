    "in these years there has been introduced and intensively investigated an operation called _ hairpin completion _ in formal language theory , inspired by intra molecular phenomena in molecular biology .",
    "a hairpin structure is well - known as one of the most popular secondary structures for a single stranded dna ( or rna ) molecule to form , with the help of so - called _ watson - crick complementarity _ and _ annealing _ , under a certain biochemical condition in a solution .",
    "this paper continues research directed by a series of works started in @xcite where the hairpin completion operation was introduced , followed by several other related papers ( @xcite ) , where both the hairpin completion and its inverse operation ( the hairpin reduction ) were investigated .    inspired by threefold motivations",
    ", we will introduce the notion of _ hairpin incompletion _ in this paper .",
    "firstly , the hairpin incompletion is a natural extension of the notion of _ bounded hairpin completion _ introduced and studied in @xcite which is a restricted variant of the hairpin completion with the property that the length of the prefix ( suffix ) prolongation is constantly bounded .",
    "thus , the bounded hairpin completion involves the lengthening of prefix ( suffix ) with a constant length of the strand at the end , which implies that the resulting strand always bears a specific property that its prefix and suffix _ always form complementary sub - strands _ of a certain constant length .",
    "in contrast , our notion of hairpin incompletion can produce a resulting strand with more complexity , due to the nature of its prolongation , which will be formally explained later .",
    "secondly , the hairpin incompletion is also regarded as a restricted variant of the notion of _ hairpin lengthening _ recently introduced in @xcite which is an extension of the ( original ) notion of the hairpin completion .",
    "more specifically , the hairpin lengthening concerns the prolongation of a strand that allows to stop itself at any position in the process of completing a hairpin structure . from the practical and molecular implementation point of view , here we are interested in the case where the prolongation in the hairpin lengthening is bounded by a constant , which leads to our notion of the hairpin incompletion . in this respect , one may take the hairpin incompletion as the _ bounded _ variant of the hairpin lengthening .",
    "thirdly , the hairpin incompletion can provide a purely formal framework that exactly models a bio - molecular technique called _ whiplash pcr _ that has nowadays been recognized as a promising experimental technique and has been proposed in an ingenious paper @xcite by hagiya et al .",
    "they developed an experimental technique called polymerization stop and theoretically showed in terms of thermal cycling how dna molecules can solve the learning problem of @xmath0-formulas ( i.e. , boolean formulas with each variable appearing only once ) from given data .",
    "suppose that a dna sequence is designed as given in ( a ) of figure 1 , where a sequence of transition ( program ) is delimited by a special sequence ( called _ stopper sequence _ ) and @xmath1 and its reversal complementarity @xmath2 may hybridize , leading to a hairpin structure ( b ) .",
    "then , the head @xmath2 ( current state ) is extended by polymerization ( with a primer @xmath2 and a template @xmath3 ) up to @xmath4 , where the stopper sequence is specifically designed to act as the stopper . in this way",
    ", this cycle can execute one process of state transition and be repeatedly performed .",
    "following the work of @xcite , sakamoto et al .",
    "has shown how some np - complete problems can be solved with whiplash pcr ( or whiplash machines ) ( @xcite ) . recently , komiya et al .",
    "has demonstrated the applicability of whiplash pcr to the experimental validation of signal dependent operation ( @xcite ) .     ;",
    "( c ) polymerization extension of @xmath3 ; ( d ) simulation of one state transition . ]",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after providing the definitions of the basic concepts used in the paper , we define the central notion of _ hairpin incompletion _ ( as an extension of the bounded hairpin completion and also as a bounded variant of the hairpin lengthening ) in section 2 .",
    "we first show in section 3 that any family of languages with a certain closure properties is closed under the hairpin incompletion .",
    "we then consider the case of applying the _ iterated _ hairpin incompletion operations , and show that every afl is closed under the iterated one - sided hairpin incompletion .",
    "this result is further extended to the general case of the iterated hairpin incompletion , and it is shown that any family of languages including all linear languages and with a certain closure properties is also closed under the iterated hairpin incompletion , and as a corollary that the family of context - free languages is closed under the iterated hairpin incompletion , followed by a brief discussion with concluding remarks in section 4 .",
