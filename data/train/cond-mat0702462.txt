    "in the early seventies efimov predicted that bosons with strong two - body interactions may bind together to form trimers with interesting universal properties , even under conditions where two - body bound states are not allowed @xcite .",
    "in particular , an infinite series of weakly bound three - body levels appears close to the continuum threshold when the magnitude of the scattering length @xmath2 becomes large compared to the characteristic range of the potential @xmath3 , which is of order @xmath4 for alkali atoms ( @xmath5 being the bohr radius ) . in the region",
    "close to a resonance of @xmath6 , these states are universal in the sense that they map onto each other via a discrete scaling symmetry , obtained by multiplying lengths and energies by a factor @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively , where @xmath9 @xcite .",

    "indeed , the two - body scattering length @xmath6 alone is not sufficient to determine the solution of the three - body bosonic problem .",
    "remarkable results have been obtained within the so - called `` universal theory '' ( ut ) @xcite , which assumes @xmath10 and a two - body t - matrix proportional to @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the energy in the center - of - mass frame of the two atoms .",
    "nonetheless ut has _ a priori _ no predictive power , since it contains two undetermined parameters , the first fixing the structure of the energy levels , and the second describing recombination into deeply - bound levels .",
    "the analysis of current experiments in ultracold gases by means of ut might not properly work for different reasons . in first instance , experiments are usually performed outside the regime @xmath13 , in order to avoid large three - body losses which in bosonic systems rise rapidly as @xmath14 close to a resonance .",
    "in addition , most of the interesting feshbach resonances are characterized by background scattering lengths @xmath15 which are large compared to the range @xmath3 , signaling the presence of a shallow ( long - lived or bound ) state in the open channel of the resonance which is not taken into account by the scattering length approximation .",
    "it is therefore interesting to develop a model that does not rely on the assumptions of ut and compare it with the existing theories , such as those based on the hyperspherical method @xcite or the ags approach @xcite .",

    "we show that the presence of this bound state implies the possibility of having a sharp minimum in the three - body recombination even at negative scattering lengths , and it introduces noticeable modifications to the energy dependence of the low - lying trimer levels . as an example , we find that the trimer ground state in @xmath0cs never hits the three - body continuum threshold at large values of the magnetic field , as shown in fig .",
