    "in the standard paradigm of cosmic structure formation , it is expected that many wide massive black hole binaries ( mbhbs ) will form following the mergers of two massive galaxies ( e.g. begelman , blandford , & rees 1980 ; volonteri , haardt , & madau 2003 ; mayer 2007 ) .",
    "the binary will subsequently shrink due to stellar or gas dynamical processes and may ultimately coalesce by emitting a burst of gravitational waves .",
    "it was first proposed by ebisuzaki , makino , & okumura ( 1991 ) that the heating of the surrounding stars by a decaying smbh pair would create a low - density core out of a preexisting cuspy ( e.g. @xmath6 ) stellar profile . in a purely stellar background a ` hard ' binary shrinks by capturing the stars that pass close to the holes and ejecting them at much higher velocities , a super - elastic scattering process ( ` gravitational slingshot ' ) that depletes the nuclear region .",
    "observationally , there is evidence in early  type galaxies for a systematically different distribution of surface brightness profiles , with faint ellipticals showing steep power - law profiles ( cusps ) , while bright ellipticals have much shallower stellar cores ( e.g. faber 1997 ; ravindranath 2001 ) .",
    "dwarf ellipticals seem to elude this paradigm showing somewhat flat profiles , similarly to bright ones ( graham & guzman 2003 ) . late  type spirals tend to show steep central cusps , as in the case of the milky way or andromeda .",
    "detailed n - body simulations have confirmed the cusp - disruption effect of a hardening mbhb ( makino & ebisuzaki 1996 ; quinlan & hernquist 1997 ; milosavljevic & merritt 2001 ) , while semi - analytic modelling in the framework of hierarchical structure formation theories has shown that the cumulative damage done to a stellar cusps by decaying black hole pairs may explain the observed correlation between the ` mass deficit ' ( the mass needed to bring a flat inner density profile to a @xmath7 cusp ) and the mass of the nuclear black hole ( volonteri , madau , & haardt 2003 ) .",
    "this is the third paper of a series aimed at the detailed study of the interaction between mbhbs and their stellar environment . in sesana , haardt , & madau ( 2006,2007a , hereafter paper i and paper ii )",
    ", we analyzed the three - body scatterings between a mbhb and background stars _",
    "unbound _ to the binary .",
    "the assumption of a fixed background breaks down once the binary has ejected most of the stars on intersecting orbits , and the extraction of energy and angular momentum from the binary can continue only if new stars can diffuse into low - angular momentum orbits ( refilling the binary s phase - space `` loss cone '' ) , or via gas processes . in galaxies with inner cores or shallow",
    "cusps , only a small fraction of the loss cone is confined within the sphere of influence of the binary , and the approximation of a background of unbound stars is reasonable .",
    "a similar argument holds also in the case of a galaxy with a steep cusp hosting a nearly equal - mass binary ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the radius of influence of such a pair , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the stellar velocity dispersion , is of the order of the binary hardening radius , @xmath11 , and only few low - angular momentum stars have orbits with semi - major axis @xmath12 . this is not true for unequal - mass binaries , where @xmath13 , and almost all interacting stars are bound to @xmath14 .    in this paper",
    "we develop a formalism for studying the dynamics of mbhbs embedded in gravitationally - bound stellar cusps . the plan is as follows . in   2 we describe our suite of three - body scattering experiments between the black hole pair and ambient bound stars .",
    "our numerical results are used in   3 and   4 to construct a `` hybrid model '' of binary dynamics and investigate the orbital decay and shrinking of mbhbs in time - evolving stellar cusps .",
    "the properties of the ejected hvss are discussed in   5 . the massive black hole ( sgr a@xmath4 ) in the galactic center and the stars around it offer a unique opportunity to study stellar dynamics in the extreme environment around a relativistic potential .",
    "the scattering of stars bound to sgr a@xmath4 by an inspiraling intermediate - mass black hole ( imbh ) is treated in ",
    "finally , we present a brief summary in   7 .",
    "consider a mbh of mass @xmath14 surrounded by a stellar cusp ( with density profile @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) , interacting with a secondary  intruder \" hole of mass @xmath17 .",
    "as the binary separation decays , the effectiveness of dynamical friction slowly declines because distant stars perturb the binary s center of mass but not its semi - major axis .",
    "the bound pair then loses orbital energy by capturing ambient stars and ejecting them at much higher velocities , a three - body scattering process known as the ` gravitational slingshot ' . for unequal - mass binaries ( mass ratio @xmath18 ) , @xmath19 , implying that the stellar mass inside @xmath20 is @xmath21 . in this case , the contribution to the potential energy given by the stellar distribution during a binary - star interaction can be ignored , and the problem can be tackled by means of three - body scattering experiments .",
    "following the guidelines fully described in paper i , we performed numerical experiments to study the interaction of a mbhb with a star of mass @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) bound to @xmath14 .",
    "note that , for extreme mass ratios @xmath24 , the encounter is essentially a two - body scattering as the star and the secondary hole move in the static potential of the primary .",
    "the integration of the three - body encounter equations is greatly simplified by setting the center of mass of the binary at rest in the origin of the coordinate system .",
    "the binary orbits counterclockwise in the @xmath25 plane , and the apoastron of @xmath26 is located along the positive @xmath27-axis .",
    "stars are drawn from a spherical isotropic distribution bound to @xmath14 .",
    "the problem is completely defined by ten variables :    1 .",
    "the binary mass ratio @xmath28 ; 2 .   the binary eccentricity @xmath29 ; 3 .   the stellar mass @xmath22 ; 4 .   the initial distance between the primary hole and the star , @xmath30 ; 5 .   the specific energy of the stellar orbit around @xmath14 , @xmath31 , or equivalently the semi - major axis of the stellar orbit , @xmath32 ; 6 .   the specific angular momentum of the stellar orbit @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the stellar velocity relative to @xmath14",
    "four angles : @xmath35 and @xmath36 describing the latitude and longitude of the star , @xmath37 defining the orientation of @xmath38 ( the stellar velocity component normal to @xmath39 ) i.e. selecting the orbital plane of the star , and @xmath40 the initial binary phase .    compared to the unbound scattering problem ( which is defined by nine variables , see paper i ) , there is here the extra variable @xmath41 , and @xmath42 and @xmath43 replace the asymptotic initial speed and impact parameter of the incoming field star .",
    "a sketch of the experiment set - up is given in figure  [ fig : incond ] .",
    "in each numerical integration , the binary mass @xmath44 and separation @xmath45 are set equal to unity , and the stellar mass to @xmath46 .",
    "scattering events are simulated in sets of @xmath47 trials for fixed values of @xmath48 and @xmath29 .",
    "we sample five values of the binary eccentricity , @xmath49 , and five values of the binary mass ratio , @xmath50 , for a grand total of 25 models .",
    "the distribution of stars bound to @xmath14 is modeled as follows . the stellar semi - major axis @xmath32 is randomly sampled from fifty logarithmic bins spanning the range @xmath51 .",
    "the angular momentum is sampled in the interval @xmath52 $ ] according to an equal probability distribution in @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the specific angular momentum of a circular orbit of radius @xmath32 .",
    "a population of stars with such distribution in @xmath53 has mean eccentricity @xmath55 , corresponding to @xmath56 .",
    "this condition defines an isotropic stellar distribution ( e.g. quinlan , hernquist , & sigurdsson 1995 ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath42 and @xmath43 define the shape of the stellar orbit .",
    "we sample the initial value of @xmath41 from the distribution @xmath57 , @xmath58 which is proportional to the the fraction of time spent by the star at distance between @xmath41 and @xmath59 from @xmath14 .",
    "the probability @xmath60 is defined in the range @xmath61 , where @xmath62 the angles @xmath35 and @xmath36 are randomly generated to reproduce a uniform density distribution over a spherical surface centered on @xmath14 , while the orientation angle @xmath37 is chosen from a uniform distribution in the range @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "we start numerical integration with @xmath26 at its apoastron ( @xmath64 ) , and have checked that the chosen initial phase of the binary does not affect our results .",
    "the orbit of the pair is in the @xmath65 plane with the center of mass at coordinates @xmath66 .",
    "the nine coupled , second order , differential equations of the three - body problem are integrated using the most recent version of the subroutine dopri5 , based on an explicit runge - kutta method of order 4(5 ) due to dormand & prince ( 1978 ) . a complete description of the integrator can be found in hairer , norsett , & wanner ( 1993 ) .",
    "the integration is stopped if any of these events occurs :    * the star leaves the sphere of radius @xmath67^{1/4}a_0 $ ] with positive total energy , where @xmath68 is the reduced mass of the binary and @xmath69 its initial semi - major axis . at @xmath70",
    "the force induced by the quadrupole moment of the binary is 10 orders of magnitude smaller than the total force acting on the star at a distance @xmath69 ; * the physical integration time exceeds 1 gyr ; * the integration reaches @xmath71 time steps .",
    "this typically corresponds to the complete integration of @xmath72 binary orbits .",
    "examples of integrated stellar orbits are given in figures [ fig : boundej ] and [ fig : boundweak ] .",
    "figure [ fig : boundej ] shows a strong interaction : the star has a close encounter with @xmath26 and leaves the binary sphere of influence with positive energy .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath32 we have a variable number of numerically `` abandoned events '' , i.e. , bound triple systems that do not readily produce an ejection .",
    "figure [ fig : boundweak ] shows one of such events : the periastron of the star is much larger than the binary orbital separation @xmath45 , and the star is not perturbed by the binary quadrupole field , except for the precession of its periastron .",
    "we have performed a number of tests to check the sensitivity of our results on numerics .",
    "because of the intrinsically chaotic nature of the three - body problem , the properties of the ejected stars are meaningful only for a statistically - significant sample .",
    "the integration of the full three - body problem allows us to directly control the conservation of total energy and angular momentum .",
    "the code adjusts the integration stepsize to keep the fractional error per step in position and velocity , @xmath73 , below @xmath74 .",
    "this allows a total energy conservation accuracy of @xmath75 in a single orbit integration , i.e. for @xmath76 the energy of the star is conserved at level of one part in a thousand during a single orbit .",
    "we varied @xmath73 between @xmath77 and @xmath78 and @xmath79 between @xmath80 and @xmath81 , and found no significant differences in the statistics of the ejected population .",
    "we have also checked that the mean energy and angular momentum exchanges scale linearly with @xmath22 .",
    "a set of longer orbit integrations was performed to test that the number of abandoned events does not depend on the finite numbers of timesteps allowed , again finding no systematic decrease in such a number .",
    "each logarithmic bin in @xmath32 was sampled by @xmath82 stars .",
    "we calculated the mean energy and angular momentum exchange between the mbhb and the stars , the final velocity and angular distribution of the scattered stars , the fraction @xmath83 of stars that are ejected in the interaction , and the ejection timescales .",
    "the fraction @xmath83 is plotted versus @xmath84 in figure [ fig4.1 ] for different values of the binary parameters @xmath48 and @xmath29 .",
    "eccentric binaries can eject stars that are initially very tightly bound to @xmath14 , i.e. with @xmath32 as small as @xmath85 . for @xmath86 ,",
    "the expelled fraction declines significantly , regardless of binary eccentricity .",
    "it is also evident that the ejection process is more efficient for large values of @xmath48 .",
    "figure  [ fig4.3 ] shows the mean fractional eccentricity change of the pair after each scattering , @xmath87 , as a function of @xmath84 .",
    "this quantity is found to scale linearly with @xmath79 .",
    "stars with @xmath88 typically tend to reduce the binary eccentricity , while stars with @xmath89 work in the opposite direction .",
    "an eccentric binary spends most of its period near its apocenter , so in the case @xmath89 the probability of a close star - binary encounter ( and subsequent star ejection ) is maximal at binary apocenter . in the instantaneous interaction",
    "the binary velocity decreases . as close to the apocenter the binary velocity is nearly tangential , the binary",
    "is forced on a more radial orbit . on the contrary ,",
    "a star with @xmath88 `` feels '' the secondary hole @xmath26 when this approaches the primary @xmath14 at a distance @xmath90 . at that point ,",
    "the interaction with the star is unlikely to occur close to the pericenter of @xmath26 ( being the time spent by @xmath26 at the pericenter very small ) , and typically also extracts a large radial component from the velocity of the secondary black hole , hence causing circularization .",
    "note that in this case the absolute value of @xmath91 is larger , according to the @xmath92 dependence in equation ( [ deltaebound ] ) ( see the different positive and negative @xmath93-axis scales in fig .",
    "[ fig4.3 ] ) .",
    "we will return on this point in section 3 , giving a simple , physically motivated , mathematical derivation of this qualitative argument .",
    "figure  [ fig4.4 ] depicts the fractional number of stars ejected in the time interval @xmath94 and @xmath95 as a function of the ejection timescale @xmath94 .",
    "the latter is measured in units of the binary orbital period at separation @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and is defined as the time elapsed from the start of numerical integration to the moment the interacting star reaches , with positive energy , a distance @xmath98 from the binary center - of - mass . for large values of @xmath48 , it typically takes the mbhb just a few orbits to expel the star , while lowering @xmath48 makes the distribution of slingshot timescales broader and flatter .",
    "the ejection rate remains approximately constant , or decreases slowly , for @xmath99 , and drops dramatically afterwards .",
    "the binary eccentricity plays no role in all the tested cases .",
    "figure  [ fig6bis ] shows the mean ejection timescale ( i.e. , the integral of @xmath100 in @xmath101 ) as a function of the star eccentricity @xmath102 , for different values of @xmath48 and @xmath29 . in first approximation",
    ", one can assume that the cusp remain isotropic during the binary orbital evolution .",
    "we checked that our results are practically the same considering @xmath103 rather than @xmath104 as the outer boundary in the sampled @xmath32 distribution .",
    "this is because the binary  stars interaction is dominated , in terms of energy and angular momentum exchange , by those stars whose @xmath32 is @xmath105 .    from our scattering experiments",
    ", we can finally derive the bivariate distribution functions @xmath106 and @xmath107 , along the same line described in paper ii .",
    "for a given @xmath32 , we record the number of of stars with ejection speed in the interval @xmath108 , leaving the binary with latitude ( longitude ) at infinity in the interval @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "the differential distributions are normalized as follows : @xmath111 the subscript  1 \" is meant to indicate that the scattering experiments are performed for a binary at separation @xmath112 .",
    "to study the impact of the gravitational slingshot on the dynamical evolution of a mbhb , we have developed a self - consistent hybrid model , in which numerical results of scattering experiments in a fixed stellar background are coupled to an analytical formulation of loss - cone depletion .",
    "this technique allows us to simultaneously follow the orbital decay of the pair as well as the time evolution of the stellar cusp .",
    "the hybrid model is similar , in spirit , to the case extensively discussed in paper ii of an unbound stellar population interacting with a black hole pair .",
    "scattering experiments are performed for a binary at fixed orbital separation @xmath45 , and the results scaled to any value of @xmath45 .",
    "then , by specifying the pace at which @xmath45 evolves , we can solve for the binary orbital decay with time .",
    "mathematical details , however , are different from the scheme developed in paper ii . in the unbound case , the pair interacts with a stellar population approaching its sphere of influence at a given rate , and the typical three - body interaction is a  fast \" process . for stars bound to @xmath14 instead , the interacting stellar population is in place from the beginning .",
    "the temporal evolution of the system is then determined by the ejection timescale rather than by supply rate .",
    "it is convenient to describe the stellar cusp using @xmath113 , the differential number of stars orbiting @xmath14 with semi - major axis in the range @xmath114 . for an isotropic stellar distribution @xmath115 where the stellar density profile is @xmath116 and @xmath117",
    "is a fudge factor that depends on the cusp slope , @xmath118 for @xmath119 ( ivanov , polnarev , & saha 2005 ) .",
    "two differential equations determine the rate of change of orbital separation and eccentricity : @xmath120 and @xmath121 we start numerical integration at time @xmath122 , orbital separation @xmath69 , and binary eccentricity @xmath123 . the terms @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 are measured from our scattering experiments .",
    "the scaling of the eccentricity change with binary parameters @xmath127 and @xmath92 can be derived from ( quinlan 1996 ) @xmath128 where @xmath129 and @xmath130 are the total angular momentum and energy of the binary , respectively . from @xmath131 ( in a typical encounter , on average ,",
    "the star gets a kick @xmath132 ) , and @xmath133 , assuming @xmath134 , we have @xmath135 this confirms the qualitative argument developed in section 2.3 and accounts for the features shown in figure 5 : the mean @xmath124 scales with the inverse of the mass ratio , and , from @xmath136 , results negative for @xmath137 ( promoting circularization ) , and positive for larger @xmath84 ( hence increasing the binary eccentricity ) .    the binary energy change per scattering , @xmath125 ,",
    "is related to the change of stellar energy @xmath138 by @xmath139 , where we have neglected the energy change of the binary center of mass ( which is a factor @xmath79 smaller than @xmath125 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath138 can be written as @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the circular velocity of the binary .",
    "the numerical factor @xmath142 depends upon the ratio @xmath84 , and @xmath29 , and is derived from our numerical experiments .",
    "the term @xmath126 quantifies the number of stars orbiting @xmath14 within @xmath32 and @xmath143 that are ejected from the system in the time interval between @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "this term depends on @xmath32 , @xmath45 , @xmath29 and @xmath144 , and is determined as follows . from scattering experiments",
    "we derive the distribution @xmath146 describing the probability that a star at @xmath147 becomes unbound from a binary with eccentricity @xmath29 in the time interval @xmath148 .",
    "note that the distribution of ejection timescales plotted in figure  [ fig4.4 ] is simply the probability function @xmath149 averaged over @xmath150 , @xmath151 when @xmath152 ( the exact value depending on @xmath48 and @xmath29 ) most stars remain bound to @xmath14 , and @xmath153 ( see fig .  [ fig4.1 ] ) . as @xmath154",
    "all interacting stars are instead expelled .",
    "we can see from figure  [ fig4.4 ] that , in the ejection regime , the distribution @xmath149 is nearly independent on @xmath150 and has the same functional form ( as a function of @xmath94 ) of @xmath155 . from @xmath149",
    "we can then compute @xmath126 as a function of @xmath144 if we set @xmath156 , where the term @xmath157 accounts for the change in the time units of @xmath149 as @xmath45 changes .",
    "though not formally correct , the scheme catches the basic physics of the interaction in a time - dependent fashion .",
    "suppose now that in a small time interval @xmath158 after the beginning of the interaction the binary remains at constant separation @xmath69 corresponding to @xmath159 .",
    "the number of stars ( with semi - major axis in the interval @xmath160 ) ejected in such time interval is @xmath161 where for simplicity we have omitted the dependence of @xmath149 on the eccentricity .",

    "the procedure is similar to that described in the appendix of paper ii .",
    "as the binary shrinks to separation @xmath176 , the normalized distribution of ejection velocities for stars with semi - major axis in the interval @xmath114 is @xmath177 where the ejection speed @xmath178 was shifted by the factor @xmath179 to account for the increase in the circular velocity of the binary @xmath180 as the pair shrinks .",

    "the evolution of the pair is driven by three - body interactions with individual stars .",
    "our results on binary orbital decay are summarized in table 1 .",
    "a mbhb can shrink by factors ranging from 6 to 18 depending on @xmath48 , @xmath123 , and @xmath207 .",
    "the decay factor @xmath208 grows with @xmath123 , as more eccentric binaries can expel stars that are more tightly bound ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4.1 ] ) .",
    "the importance of the initial eccentricity @xmath123 is modest for low values of @xmath207 , since in shallow cusps the number of tightly bound stars is small anyway .",
    "the factor @xmath208 is also a weakly increasing function of @xmath48 , as for higher @xmath48 the radius of influence of the binary is larger ( in terms of @xmath84 , see fig .",
    "[ fig4.1 ] ) .",
    "the dependence of the decay factor on @xmath207 simply reflects the fact that , for steeper stellar cusps , the mean binding energy of the stars is larger . for @xmath209 and less than @xmath210 for @xmath211 ,",
    "see table 1 of paper ii ) to binary hardening for very unequal - mass pairs . in the bound case ,",

    "the anisotropy of the hvs population can be quantified by computing as a function of binary separation the angles @xmath263 and @xmath264 , where @xmath265 is the latitude of the star ( the angle between the velocity vector @xmath178 at infinity and the binary orbital plane ) , and @xmath266 is its longitude ( the angle between the projection onto the binary orbital plane of the velocity vector at infinity and the @xmath27-axis ) . for a spherically - symmetric distribution , @xmath267 , and @xmath268 .",

    "this effect was already seen in three - body scattering experiments of unbound stars ( see paper i for a detailed discussion ) , and is related to the fact that , as the pair decays , its circular velocity grows and even stars experiencing relatively weak encounters can attain large kick velocities . in terms of longitude ,",
    "hvss are ejected almost isotropically , though an azimuthal anisotropy become apparent with increasing kick velocities .",
    "the high - velocity tail of the distribution is formed by stars expelled after a close encounter with @xmath26 near its periastron , in a broad jet with @xmath270 .",
