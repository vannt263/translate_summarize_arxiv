    "bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) saturated topologically stable solitons in supersymmetric theories are widely discussed at present in connection with the brane world scenarios @xcite . in theories with compact spatial dimension(s ) , two distinct degenerate mass solitons which are bps saturated classically , and to any finite order in perturbation theory , can mix nonperturbatively , thus lifting the bps bound .",
    "two shortened supermultiplets pair up with each other combining in one full supermultiplet with mass @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the central charge of the superalgebra .",
    "this phenomenon is an analog ( in the soliton sector ) of the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry due to instantons in the vacuum sector @xcite . to the best of our knowledge",

    "it is proportional to the tunneling probability which , in turn , is determined by instantons .",
    "remarkably , the instanton calculus in this case is nothing but an adaptation of the theory of the bps saturated wall junctions , which also received much attention recently @xcite . in particular , the instanton action can be derived from the central charges .",
    "the explicit formula for the instanton solution is not needed .",
    "the only thing we need to know is the very fact of its existence .",
    "this is in perfect parallel with the standard ( non - supersymmetric ) instantons : once one knows that the self - duality equations have a solution , the instanton action is unambiguously fixed in terms of the topological charge .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was observed that the soliton mixing , resulting in the loss of the bps saturation , can be described by an effective susy quantum mechanics ; however , the general construction presented there , is not very transparent . here",

    "classically bps saturated soliton supermultiplets which may become degenerate in mass with some other supermultiplets and lift the bps bound because of a nonperturbative mixing , is a rather general feature of various theories . although our results are applicable in all cases , we find it convenient to explain the problem in a specific setting .",
