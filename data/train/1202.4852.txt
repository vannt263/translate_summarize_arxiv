    "the ultimate goal of ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions is to produce a highly excited and dense matter which possibly involves a phase transition from a hot , dense hadron gas ( hg ) to a deconfined quark matter called as quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) [ 1 - 3 ] . in this state",
    "the degrees of freedom are those of quarks and gluons only .",
    "one hopes that by colliding heavy nuclei one can create a fireball with an extremely large energy density extending over a sufficiently large space - time volume so that an equilibrated quark - gluon plasma may be formed .",
    "however , experimental and theoretical investigations made so far reveal that it is indeed difficult to get an unambiguous evidence for qgp formation .",
    "it is very important to understand the dynamics of the collisions in order to suggest any unique signal for qgp .",
    "such information can be obtained by analyzing the properties of various particles which are emitted from various stages of the collisions .",
    "the global properties and dynamics of later stages can be best studied via hadronic observables such as hadron yields , ratios , rapidity distributions and transverse mass spectra [ 4 ] .    in our previous paper",
    "henceforth referred as i [ 5 ] , we have proposed a thermodynamically consistent excluded - volume model and studied different thermodynamical properties of hg such as number density , energy density , pressure etc .. it is indeed surprising that the predictions of our geometrical model regarding the detailed features of various hadron ratios and their variations with respect to the center - of - mass energy ( @xmath11 ) are successfully tested with the available experimental data upto relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) energies .",
    "we know that if a system passes through a mixed phase in a first order phase transition , then it can possess a much larger space - time extent than what we expect from a system if it remains in the hadronic phase only .",
    "thus the freeze - out volume @xmath12 of the fireball formed in heavy - ion collisions , is a significant quantity which can give a hint regarding the occurrence of mixed phase during a phase transition .",
    "furthermore , the freeze - out volume throws light on the collective expansion and/or anisotropic flow of the fluid existing in the fireball before a final thermal freeze - out occurs . in this paper , we calculate the variations of chemical freeze - out volumes for @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath13 with respect to @xmath11 and compare our predictions with the hbt interferometry data for the thermal freeze - out volume .",
    "it gives an independent confirmation pertinent to correctness of the geometrical assumptions involved in our model on the space dynamics of the fireball .",
    "we also attempt to show the variations of total multiplicities as well as the multiplicity in a slice of unit rapidity at midrapidity @xmath14 for various emitted hadrons , e.g. , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath13 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8,@xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "further , we extend our model to deduce the rapidity as well as transverse mass spectra of hadrons and compare them with the experimental data available in order to illustrate the role of hydrodynamic flow of the fluid .    in heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "rapidity densities of produced particles are strongly related to the energy density and/or entropy density created in the collisions [ 6 ] .",
    "further , the dependence of transverse mass spectra of hadrons on @xmath11 can yield insight into the evolution of a radial flow present in the dense fluid formed in the collision [ 7 ] .",
    "earlier different types of approaches have been taken into account for studying rapidity distributions and transverse mass spectra [ 8 - 13 ] .",
    "hadronic spectra from purely thermal models usually reveal an isotropic distribution of particles [ 8 ] and hence the rapidity spectra obtained with the thermal models do not reproduce the features of the experimental data satisfactorily .",
    "similarly , the transverse mass spectra from the thermal models reveal a more steeper curve than that observed experimentally .",
    "the comparisons illustrate that the fireball formed in heavy - ion collisions does not expand isotropically in nature and there is a prominent input of collective flow in the longitudinal and transverse directions which finally causes anisotropy in the rapidity and transverse mass distributions of the hadrons after the freeze - out .",
    "a lot of work has been done in recent years on thermal model calculations incorporating the effect of flow [ 14 - 23 ] . here",
    "we mention some kinds of models of thermal and collective flow used in the literature .",
    "hydrodynamical properties of the expanding fireball have been initially discussed by landau and bjorken for the stopping and central - rapidity regimes , respectively [ 9 ] .",
    "however , collisions even at rhic energies reveal that they are neither fully stopped , nor fully transparent . as the collision energy increases , the longitudinal flow grows stronger and leads to a cylindrical geometry as postulated in ref .",
    "[ 10 - 12 ] .",
    "they assume that the fireballs are distributed uniformally in the longitudinal direction and demonstrate that the available data can consistently be described in a thermal model with inputs of chemical equilibrium and flow , although they have used the experimental data for small systems only .",
    "they use two simple parameters : transverse flow velocity ( @xmath15 ) and temperature ( @xmath16 ) in their models . in ref .",
    "[ 13 ] , non - uniform flow model is used to analyze the spectra specially to reproduce the dip at midrapidity in the rapidity spectra of baryons by assuming that the fireballs are distributed non - uniformly in the longitudinal phase space . in ref .",
    "[ 24 - 26 ] , the rapidity - dependent baryon chemical potential has been invoked to study the rapidity spectra of hadrons . in certain hydrodynamical models [ 27,28 ] ,",
    "measured transverse momentum ( @xmath17 ) distributions in @xmath18 collisions at @xmath19 [ 29 - 31 ] have been described successfully by incorporating a radial flow . in ref .",
    "[ 32 ] , rapidity spectra of mesons have been studied using viscous relativistic hydrodynamics in a 1 + 1 dimension assuming a non - boost invariant bjorken flow in the longitudinal direction .",
    "they have also analyzed the effect of the shear viscosity on the longitudinal expansion of the matter .",
    "shear viscosity counteracts the gradients of the velocity field , as a consequence slows down the longitudinal expansion . in this paper",
    ", we attempt to calculate the rapidity density of various particles at midrapidity by using our excluded - volume model of hg and we find a good agreement between our model calculations and the experimental data .",
    "however , when we calculate the rapidity distributions of various particles , we find that the distribution always takes a narrow shape in comparison to the experimental data and thus indicating that our thermal model alone is not capable to describe the experimental data in forward and backward rapidity regions . in a similar way",
    ", the transverse mass spectra of hadrons as obtained in our model again does not describe the experimental data properly .",
    "our analysis clearly necessitates the presence of an additional flow factor to be introduced in the model in order to provide a suitable description of the data .",
    "we plan to study the rapidity distributions and transverse mass spectra of hadrons using our model in i [ 5 ] for a hot , dense hg which is based on an excluded - volume approach [ 33 ] formulated in a thermodynamically consistent way .",
    "we have assigned an equal hard - core size to each type of baryons in the hg while the mesons are treated as pointlike particles .",
    "we use the chemical freeze - out criteria to relate the thermal parameters @xmath16 and @xmath20 with the collision energies [ 5 ] .",
    "we further emphasize that we have used this hadronic equation of state ( eos ) together with a suitable eos for qgp in order to obtain the qcd phase diagram and the associated critical point [ 34 ] .",
    "the plan of the paper runs as follows : the next section is dedicated to the formulation of our model for the study of the rapidity distributions and transverse mass spectra of hadrons using purely thermal source . in the third section , we modify the formula for the rapidity distributions by incorporating a flow velocity in the longitudinal direction and similarly the formula for the transverse mass spectra is also modified by incorporating a collective flow in the longitudinal as well as in the transverse direction . in section iv , we compare the experimental data with our predictions regarding rapidity density , transverse mass spectra and transverse momentum spectra of hadrons at rhic energies @xmath21 and @xmath22 and lhc energy @xmath23 .",
    "we have also shown the rapidity spectra of @xmath24 at super proton synchrotron ( sps ) energies .",
    "as @xmath11 increases , the longitudinal as well as the transverse flow also increase which means that the experiments will observe a larger amount of collective flow at lhc .",
    "we have also deduced total mean multiplicities , mid - rapidity yields of various hadrons and their rapidity densities and studied their variations with @xmath11 .",
    "thus we determine the freeze - out volume and/or @xmath1 in order to ascertain whether the emissions of all hadrons occur from the same hypersurface of the fireball .",
    "we also analyze the experimental data on the production of light nuclei , hypernuclei and their antiparticles over a broad energy going from ags to rhic energies .",
    "this analysis thus fully demonstrates the validity of our eos in describing all the features of a hot , dense hg .",
    "finally , in the last section we succinctly give the conclusions and summary .",
    "to study the rapidity distributions and transverse mass spectra of the hadrons , we extend excluded - volume model as proposed in i [ 5 ] , which was found to describe the hadron ratios and yields at various @xmath11 from lower ags energies upto rhic energies with remarkable success .",
    "we have incorporated the excluded - volume correction directly in the grand canonical partition function of hg in a thermodynamically consistent manner .",
    "we obtain the number density @xmath25 for ith species of baryons after excluded - volume correction as follows [ 5 ] :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the fractional occupied volume by the baryons [ 5,34 ] .",
    "@xmath28 is the eigen - volume of each baryon having a hard - core radius @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the fugacity of ith baryon .",
    "further , @xmath31 is the integral of the baryon distribution function over the momentum space [ 5 ] .",
    "we can rewrite eq .",
    "( 1 ) in the following manner :    @xmath32 } \\\\ -\\lambda_i(1-r)\\;\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{d^3k}{\\displaystyle \\big[exp\\left(\\frac{e_i}{t}\\right)+\\lambda_i\\big]^2}\\big ] .",

    "also @xmath38 is the energy of ith baryon and @xmath12 is the total volume of the fireball formed at chemical freeze - out and @xmath39 is the total number of ith baryons .",
    "we assume that the freeze - out volume of the fireball for all types of hadrons at the time of the homogeneous emissions of hadrons remains the same .    by inserting @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( 5 ) and integrating the whole expression over transverse component we can get the rapidity distributions of baryons as follows :    @xmath41 } \\\\ -\\lambda_i(1-r)\\;\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{m_t^2\\;coshy\\;dm_t}{\\displaystyle\\big[exp\\left(\\frac{m_t\\;coshy}{t}\\right)+\\lambda_i\\big]^2}\\big ] .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ]    eq.(6 ) gives the rapidity distributions of baryons arising due to a stationary thermal source .",
    "here we evaluate the rapidity distributions of hadrons at @xmath42 as the data have been taken for the @xmath42 case .",
    "similarly , the rapidity density of mesons can be had by using the following formula :    @xmath43}.\\ ] ]    here @xmath44 , @xmath45 are the degeneracy factor and fugacity of the meson @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "we use boltzmann statistics in deriving formula for the transverse mass spectra because we want to calculate spectra of hadrons only at rhic energies , where the effect of quantum statistics is found to be negligible [ 10 ] . in the boltzmann s approximation ,",
    "eq.(5 ) can be reduced to a simple form :    @xmath47 e_i\\;\\big[exp\\left(\\frac{-e_i}{t}\\right)\\big].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    putting @xmath40 in eq.(8 ) and integrating over rapidity ( @xmath36 ) we get the transverse mass spectra as follows :    @xmath48 \\int_0^\\infty m_t\\;coshy\\;\\big[exp\\left(\\frac{-m_t\\;coshy}{t}\\right)\\big]dyd\\phi,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    or , this means :    @xmath49\\;m_t\\:k_1\\big(\\frac{m_t}{t}\\big),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath50 is the modified bessel s function and is given by the following expression :    @xmath51dy.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    similarly transverse mass spectrum of mesons can be evaluated as follows :    @xmath52",
    "in the previous section , we have obtained the expression for rapidity distributions as well as transverse mass spectra arising from a stationary thermal source only . in this section ,",
    "we modify the expression for rapidity spectra i.e. eq .",
    "( 6 ) , by incorporating a flow velocity to a stationary thermal system in the longitudinal direction and thus we attempt to explain the experimental data in the full rapidity region .",
    "the resulting rapidity spectrum of ith hadron , after the incorporation of the flow velocity in the longitudinal direction is [ 10,11 ] :    @xmath53    where @xmath54 can be calculated by using eq.(6 ) for the baryons and by eq.(7 ) for the mesons .",
    "the average longitudinal velocity is [ 13,35 ] :    @xmath55    here @xmath56 is an important parameter which provides the upper rapidity limit for the longitudinal flow velocity at particular @xmath11 and it s value is determined by the best experimental fit . the value of @xmath56 increases with the increasing @xmath11 and hence @xmath57 also increases .    in the case of transverse mass spectra , we incorporate flow velocity in both the directions , longitudinal as well as transverse directions in order to describe the experimental data satisfactorily . however , we assume radial type of flow velocity in the transverse direction which imparts a radial velocity boost on top of the thermal distribution . we define the four velocity field in both the directions as follows [ 36 ] :    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the radial flow velocity in the transverse direction and @xmath60 is the flow velocity in the longitudinal direction .",
    "once we have defined the flow velocity field , we can calculate the invariant momentum spectrum by using the following formula [ 10,37 ] :    @xmath61\\int exp\\big(\\frac{-k_{\\mu}u^{\\mu}}{t}\\big)\\;k_\\lambda\\;d\\sigma_\\lambda.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the derivation of eq.(16 ) we assume that an isotropic thermal distribution of hadrons is boosted by the local fluid velocity @xmath62 .",
    "now the resulting spectrum can be written as follows [ 10 ] :    @xmath63\\;\\int r\\;dr\\;d\\phi\\;d\\zeta \\\\ \\times\\;exp\\big(-\\frac{m_t cosh(y-\\eta)\\;cosh\\rho - p_tsinh\\rho\\;cos\\phi}{t}\\big ) .",

    "now , integrating eq.(17 ) over @xmath6 as well as @xmath69 , we get the final expression for the transverse mass spectra [ 10 ] :    @xmath71\\int_0^r r\\;dr\\;k_1\\big(\\frac{m_t\\;cosh\\rho}{t}\\big)i_0\\big(\\frac{p_t\\;sinh\\rho}{t}\\big).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath72 is the modified bessel s function given by :    @xmath73    where @xmath59 is given by @xmath74 , with the velocity profile chosen as @xmath75 [ 10,11 ] .",

    "although the emission of hadrons from a statistical thermal model essentially invokes the idea of equilibration , it does not reveal any information regarding the existence of a qgp phase before hadronization .",

    "we present an analysis of light nuclei , hypernuclei and their anti - particles using the chemical freeze - out concept within our model calculation .",
    "the productions of light nuclei and hypernuclei at chemical freeze - out points may not be appropriately calculated , because their binding energies are of the order of few mev and the chemical freeze - out temperatures are around @xmath139 .",
    "but we know that the relative yield of particles composed of nucleons is mainly determined by the entropy per baryon which is fixed at chemical freeze - out line in our model [ 5 ] .",
    "this was first outlined in [ 69 ] and was subsequently emphasized in [ 70 ] .",
    "this constitutes the basis of thermal analyses for the yields of light nuclei [ 71,72 ] .",
    "thus the production yields of light nuclei and hypernuclei is entirely governed by the entropy conservation .",
    "recently the first measurement of the lightest ( anti ) hypernuclei was done by the star experiment at rhic [ 73 ] .",
    "we want to ask an interesting question whether the productions of antinuclei can also be explained by our model . in this paper , we predict and throw light on the production yields of light nuclei , hypernuclei , and heavy baryons ( anti - baryons ) within our thermal model approach and we compare our thermal model calculations with the experimental data .",

    "we take three times of volume and mass of each nucleon to calculate the volume and mass of @xmath142 in our calculation .",
    "similarly , we calculate densities of other nuclei and hypernuclei using the similar method .",
    "we compare our results with the experimental data [ 74 ] and find a good agreement between these two .",
    "we stress that the agreement between the experimental and the calculated curves for the ratio @xmath143 is a powerful argument that indeed entropy conservation governs the production of light nuclei . in fig .",
    "20 , we show the variations of @xmath144 with @xmath11 .",
    "we compare our results with the experimental data points [ 74 ] .",

    "some data have started appearing and we find that our model gives a good fit to the data .",
    "in conclusion , we find that our model provides a good fit to the variations of total multiplicities as well as mid - rapidity densities of various particles and we deduce a large freeze - out volume of the fireball at rhic energy and this picture supports the idea of a mixed phase after qgp formation before hadronization because a huge size of a homogeneous fireball source can only arise if a mixed phase has occurred before the formation of a hot , dense hg .",
    "further , we present an analysis of rapidity distributions and transverse mass spectra of hadrons in central nucleus - nucleus collisions at various center - of - mass energies using our recently proposed equation of state ( eos ) . we see that the stationary thermal source alone can not describe the experimental data fully unless we incorporate flow velocities in the longitudinal as well as in the transverse direction in our thermal model and as a result our modified model predictions show a good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "our analysis shows that a collective flow develops at each @xmath11 which increases further with the increasing @xmath11 .",
    "the description of the rapidity distributions and transverse mass spectra of hadrons at each @xmath11 matches very well with the experimental data .",
    "although , we are not able to describe successfully the spectra for multistrange particles which suggests that a somewhat different type of mechanism is required .",
    "we find that the particle yields and ratios measured in heavy - ion collisions are described well by our thermal model and show an overwhelming evidence for chemical equilibrium at all beam energies .",
    "the rapidity distributions and transverse mass spectra which essentially are dependent on thermal parameters , also show a systematic behaviour and their interpretations most clearly involve the presence of a collective flow in the description of the thermal model .",
    "we have also found that our model together with a quasiparticle eos for qgp gives the qcd phase boundary and the location of critical point almost overlapping on the freeze - out curve as predicted earlier [ 34 ] . in conclusion",
    ", we find that our model provides an excellent description for the thermal and hadronic properties of the hg fireball and associated phase transitions existing in the ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions .    in summary",
    ", we have formulated a thermodynamically consistent eos for a hot and dense hg fireball created in the ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we have incorporated a geometrical hard - core size for baryons and antibaryons only . in our description mesons",
    "may possess a size but they can penetrate and overlap on each other . our prescription has also made use of full quantum statistics [ 5 ] .",
    "it is encouraging to note that our results for particle - ratios and their energy - dependence , total multiplicities , rapidity densities and rapidity and momentum spectra of various particles consistently match with the experimental data .",
    "we should emphasize that the hadrons emerging from a completely thermalized hg fireball do not give any information regarding a primordial qgp phase existing before hg .",
    "however , the large freeze - out volume of the fireball obtained in this analysis hints at a mixed phase occurring before pure hg phase .",
