    "the early years of spintonics have focused on the giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) of magnetic metallic multilayers@xcite , and the tunnel magnetoresistance of magnetic tunnel junctions combining metallic ferromagnets and insulating barriers @xcite . both have led to interesting devices such as magnetoresistive read heads , sensors and an incoming new generation of non volatile magnetic random access memories ( mrams ) .",
    "further developments in spintronics @xcite now aim at combining ferromagnets with semiconductors in order to , for instance , modulate spin - polarized transport by a gate voltage .",
    "this functionality opens exciting perspectives , but is prohibited in fully metallic structures because of the large carrier density ( n @xmath8 10@xmath9 @xmath10 ) .",
    "unfortunately , at the interface between a ferromagnetic metal ( fm ) and a semiconductor ( sc ) spin - flip events ( inversely proportional to the resistivity @xmath11 times the spin diffusion length @xmath12 lead to an almost complete loss of the spin polarization inside the metallic ferromagnet due to the difference in the resistivities between the two materials@xcite . such a loss",
    "is not observed in metallic multilayers such as co / cu , due to the similarity of their @xmath13 products , and an efficient spin injection can occur in cu .",
    "it has been suggested that introducing a spin - dependent resistance at the fm / sc interface can solve this problem of `` conductivity mismatch '' @xcite . yet , one of the best solutions would be to realize heterostructures combining highly spin - polarized ferromagnets and non - magnetic materials with similar resistivities , to enable efficient spin injection ( in the ohmic regime ) , and low carrier density , to enable gate voltage effects .",
    "most efforts in this direction have focused on semiconductor structures using ii - vi or iii - v diluted magnetic semiconductors ( beznmnse @xcite or ( ga , mn)as @xcite ) as spin - polarized injectors . since the curie temperature ( t@xmath14 ) of ( ga , mn)as is lower than about 170k @xcite , such devices are limited to low - temperature operation .",
    "oxide materials have not been considered so far but should be interesting candidates since high - t@xmath15 ferromagnetism has been reported in diluted magnetic oxide systems ( dmos ) like co - doped tio@xmath16 @xcite and zno @xcite for instance .",
    "in addition , high - t@xmath15 ferromagnetism was recently found in la- and co - doped srtio@xmath0 thin films @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present results on structures combining ( la , sr)ti@xmath17co@xmath18o@xmath0 ( co - lsto ) and srtio@xmath0 ( sto ) .",
    "the archetypical perovskite sto is widely used as an insulating and diamagnetic substrate for thin film growth .",
    "remarkably , its transport properties can be drastically modified by doping with nb @xcite , la @xcite or by creating oxygen vacancies , and a transition towards a metallic state occurs for carrier densities as low as @xmath8 10@xmath19 @xmath10 ( ) .    here , we report the properties of ferromagnetic co - lsto thin films grown on sto ( 001 ) substrates at low oxygen pressure ( 7@xmath2010@xmath21 @xmath6 p@xmath22 @xmath6 5@xmath2010@xmath23 mbar ) . in these conditions ,",
    "the co - lsto films are ferromagnetic with a large intrinsic spin - polarization and the sto substrates are conductive .",
    "both materials have low - temperature resistivities in the m@xmath24 cm range and in sto , we find mobilities of up to 10@xmath2 @xmath3/vs .",
    "accordingly , shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) oscillations are observed and their analysis reveal that carriers have long scattering rates of @xmath25 s , suggesting a spin - diffusion length exceeding 1 @xmath4 m .",
    "we argue that this observation , together with the low carrier density in sto and the large spin - polarization of co - lsto , opens the way for the realization of full oxide spin field effect transistors ( spin - fet ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tabsampcolsto ]    our resistance and mobility data can therefore be summarized as follows .",
    "the large values of @xmath26 and @xmath4 appear only when co - lsto films are grown on sto substrates at low oxygen pressure ( samples @xmath27 ) .",
    "indeed , this conductive behavior , together with a high - mobility , is reminiscent of what was reported for bulk sto single - crystal samples either doped with nb , treated in reduced atmospheres @xcite or etched by accelerated ar ions @xcite .",
    "since the high @xmath26 and @xmath4 are observed for the films grown in the most reducing conditions ( i.e. , promoting the creation of oxygen vacancies ) , the high - mobility and low resistance state come most likely from the sto substrate .",
    "on the other hand , lao or high - p@xmath22 sto are insulators , and the measured transport properties of samples @xmath28 and @xmath29 are probably intrinsic of co - lsto .",
    "thus , in our interpretation , the transport properties displayed in table [ tabsampsto ] ( samples @xmath27 ) refer to the sto substrate , whereas table [ tabsampcolsto ] ( samples @xmath30 ) corresponds to the electronic properties of co - lsto .    .",

    "a large positive perpendicular magnetoresistance ( pmr = @xmath35 is observed , showing oscillations ( at t @xmath6 4 k and @xmath4h @xmath5 6 t ) that are due to the shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) effect .",
    "we emphasize that we have observed sdh oscillations in all other high - mobility samples .",
    "oscillations with the same period are also observed when the field is applied parallel to the sample plane in the longitudinal configuration ( not shown ) .",
    "such observation evidences that the high - mobility region is 3d - like and is not an interface effect .",
    "quantum transport effects like sdh oscillations are usually observed in systems with high mobilities .",

    ", we can estimate the carrier density as @xmath65 @xmath10 ( see table [ tabsampsto ] and section [ annex ] ) .",
    "we observe that the mobility increases with decreasing @xmath66 ( cf . inset of fig .",
    "[ fft ] ) , in agreement with previous reported works @xcite .",
    "this may be explained by assuming that oxygen vacancies act as carrier donors , being simultaneously scattering centers .    in comparison ,",
    "the carrier density of sample @xmath675 ( co - lsto on lao ) deduced from hall experiments is @xmath68 @xmath10 .",
    "we recall that in this case the hall experiments allow the extraction of the electronic properties of the film , since the substrate is an insulator .",
    "the measured carrier density is consistent with about 0.6 carrier per formula unit , which is in a good agreement with what is expected from the film composition , assuming the presence of some oxygen vacancies .",
    "for the high - mobility samples ( @xmath39 ) , the effective mass ( @xmath53 ) of the carriers in sto was estimated by analyzing the temperature dependence of the sdh oscillations amplitude and plotting ln @xmath69 vs. temperature .",

    "the dingle temperature @xmath54 was obtained from the slope of the plot of ln @xmath73sinh@xmath74 versus 1/b at t = 1.75 k. due to the limited number of oscillations in the explored range of field values , this analysis turned out to be quite difficult .",
    "nevertheless , values of @xmath75 k were obtained , corresponding to scattering rates @xmath76 s. the values of @xmath77 correspond to the scattering rates of the closed electronic orbits around the extremal cross sections of the fermi surface . due to the cubic symmetry of sto",
    ", we can estimate the scattering rate @xmath78 at low temperature , assuming that the effective mass is isotropic and equal to m@xmath79 .",
    "using the values of @xmath4 and m@xmath79 ( table [ tabsampsto ] ) we get @xmath80 , in good agreement with the values of @xmath77 .    knowing the carrier densities and mobilities , we can calculate the resistivity through @xmath81 .",
    "we find increasing values in the range @xmath82 m@xmath83 cm , for decreasing mobilities within the range 2250 - 10500 @xmath3/vs ( see table [ tabsampsto ] ) .",
    "these values of @xmath84 are consistent with those from the literature , for similar mobility values @xcite .    the values of @xmath84 and",
    "@xmath66 allow us to estimate the order of magnitude of the thickness @xmath85 of the high mobility region inside the sto . from @xmath86 ,",
    "with @xmath87 mm and @xmath88 mm , we infer @xmath89 300 - 900 @xmath90 m .",
    "we can also estimate @xmath85 from the measured hall constant @xmath91 , and assuming the values of the carrier densities extracted from the sdh analysis ( table [ tabsampsto ] ) we find again @xmath89 300 - 900 @xmath90 m .",
    "in other words , the high mobility system is not an interfacial interface effect , but it is extended to a sizable part of the sto substrate .",
    "this is also supported by the observation of sdh oscillations when the magnetic field is applied in the film plane in the longitudinal configuration ( see section [ cipsection ] ) .",
    "an additional support for this conclusion comes from the estimation of the spread of the oxygen vacancy diffusion in sto , by using the diffusion constants determined experimentally from optical experiments @xcite . even in the less favorable case",
    "( considering trapping effects due to impurities inside the sto , and at pressures @xmath92 mbar , i. e. around four orders of magnitude higher than our growth conditions ) , the determined diffusion constants were @xmath93 @xmath3/s at t @xmath94c ; with this value , the diffusion of o - vacancies during the deposition time @xmath95 s can be estimated to be @xmath96 mm .",
    "thus , the oxygen vacancies can diffuse across the sto substrate , which is consistent with the @xmath89 300 - 900 @xmath90 m we found from transport data .",
    "the resistivity of the co - lsto films can be calculated from the resistance of the lao//co - lsto and high - p@xmath22 sto//co - lsto samples and the co - lsto film thickness .",
    "this yields 0.9 m@xmath97 cm and 1.15 m@xmath97 cm at low temperature , respectively , see table [ tabsampcolsto ] .",
    "thus , the low - temperature resistivities of the co - lsto films and the oxygen - deficient sto substrates are in the m@xmath24 cm range . due to the high mobility of the latter ,",
    "it is tempting to consider the possibility of spin - injection from co - lsto into sto , as in the co / cu case .",
    "more precisely , in this case the spin - polarization of the injected current is given by @xcite    @xmath98\\ ] ]    with @xmath99 being related to the spin - up resistivity @xmath100 and spin - down resistivity @xmath101 channels in the ferromagnet by @xmath102 .",
    "@xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , @xmath106 are the resistivities and the spin diffusion length in the ferromagnet and the non - magnetic material , respectively . in the present case , we know @xmath107 and @xmath99 should be close to -1 as the spin - polarization of co - lsto is -80% @xcite . in conventional metals , @xmath108 is usually much longer than the mean free path @xmath109 . here",
    "@xmath110 nm and @xmath111 nm but the spin diffusion lengths are unknown for virtually all oxide materials .",
    "since oxygen - deficient sto thin films with mobilities and resistivities comparable to those reported for single crystals have already been fabricated @xcite , co - lsto / sto superlattices could exhibit a significant cpp gmr and systematic gmr studies should allow measuring @xmath108 in both materials .    it must be pointed out that the efficient spin - injection from co - lsto into sto may be limited to the lowest temperatures due to the steep increase of resistivity of sto ( cf .",
    "however , if the @xmath112 ratio turns out to be too large to allow an efficient spin - injection , the latter could be increased by inserting for instance , an ultrathin tunnel barrier of lao @xcite .",
    "our tmr measurements indeed demonstrate that in the low oxygen pressure conditions required to obtain ferromagnetic co - lsto and high - mobility sto , lao retains its insulating properties .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that several groups have fabricated fets using sto as the channel material , with gains reaching 100 at room temperature @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the field effect proves efficient for a wide range of carrier density , from the undoped @xcite to the metallic state ( @xmath113 @xmath10 ) @xcite and even in the low - temperature superconducting phase @xcite .",
    "if the field effect can modify the spin - diffusion length ( in addition to the carrier density ) , or enables the tuning of spin - flip mechanisms ( in analogy to the principle of the datta and das transistor @xcite ) , full oxide spin - fet using sto channels and co - lsto as spin injector and detector could be built in the near future .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated the feasibility of growing a full oxide structure combining a highly spin polarized diluted magnetic system co - lsto and high - mobility ( up to @xmath114 @xmath3/vs ) sto , by using low oxygen pressure growth conditions . at low temperature**s * * and high magnetic fields , we have observed shubnikov - de haas oscillations in the resistance of the sto .",

    "several studies have recently demonstrated the potential of ti perovskites for oxide electronics @xcite .",
    "we are convinced that our findings extend this potential to oxide spintronics .",
    "the fermi surface of sto is composed of three ellipsoids of revolution centered at @xmath63-points with the long axis @xmath116 along @xmath61100@xmath62 crystallographic axes and the short @xmath117 axes transverse to them @xcite .",
    "the ratio between the longitudinal ( m@xmath118 ) and transverse ( m@xmath119 ) masses have been determined experimentally as m@xmath118/m@xmath119 @xmath8 4 @xcite .",

    "let us assume that a field @xmath123 is applied along the [ 001 ] direction .",

    "in addition , since @xmath116/@xmath126 there are about 4 more electrons around the ellipsoidal closed orbits than those orbiting the circular orbits . taking into account these facts , we assume that the main frequency peak of the @xmath41 oscillations comes from electrons orbiting the ellipsoidal cross sections , and , thus , a = @xmath127 . as the total volume in the k - space occupied by the 3 ellipsoids is v@xmath128 = @xmath129@xmath130@xmath116 , we can estimate the carrier concentration as @xmath131 ."
