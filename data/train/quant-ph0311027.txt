    "the basic idea of the rotation procedure described here is related to that studied by one of the authors @xcite for atoms driven by optical fields .",
    "however , there the rotation is performed by means of an adiabatic process , that requires the involvement of an additional long - lived auxiliary level and an extra coupling field . here",

    "both of our approaches are fundamentally different from the ones that have been proposed so far in the literature as they are based on the exploration of the coupled and uncoupled states of the system .",
    "moreover , the latter method is an adiabatic method , and such methods are robust with respect to fluctuations of several experimental parameters @xcite .",
    "we will discuss this issue for our case below .    the article is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly summarize the model for the three - level @xmath0-type squid qubit @xcite and present our method for arbitrary qubit rotation .",
    "the general method is also specialized in two simple cases .",

    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "we will first discuss the case of single squid qubit rotation . to achieve this",
    "the squid is driven by two microwave pulses .",
    "the microwave pulses are considered as linearly polarized electromagnetic fields with their magnetic fields perpendicular to the plane of the squid ring .",
    "we take the angular frequencies of the two microwave fields @xmath17 and @xmath18 to be near resonant with the transitions @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the states of the squid qubit and @xmath3 is an excited state , as is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the resonant approximation can then be used to describe the dynamics of the system , i.e. we assume that only the states @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 contribute to the dynamics of the system .",
    "this approximation has already been used successfully in several recent articles and the system has been termed three - level @xmath0-type squid qubit @xcite . in order to analyze our system further we use the interaction picture and apply the rotating wave approximation @xcite .",

    "if the qubit is part of a larger system , e.g. there are several qubits which form a quantum computer , then the global phase is clearly relevant , however , it may be incorporated into the algorithm being implemented on the quantum computer .",

    "the other transitions @xmath80 , with @xmath81 are coupled with external laser fields , with rabi frequency @xmath82 , with @xmath83 , such that each microwave field addresses individually only one squid .",

    "let us choose the time dependence of the pulses @xmath97 and @xmath98 such , that at early times we have @xmath112 , then after a smooth variation , at late times we have @xmath113 .",
    "we also require that the two pulses overlap .",
    "these conditions ensure that the uncoupled state @xmath110 is well - defined throughout the whole time evolution and the state of the system follows adiabatically this uncoupled state @xcite .",
    "the pulse sequence described here resembles that of the stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) , for reviews see @xcite .",
    "hence , in the above adiabatic process the state @xmath114 will evolve smoothly to the final state given by eq .",
    "( [ pts2 ] ) , and the required information transfer between squids @xmath97 and @xmath98 will be realized in this way .",

    "( [ adicond ] ) the fulfillment of adiabaticity can be verified for the chosen external rabi frequencies , cavity coupling strength , and detuning : similarly to the standard three - level stirap , large pulse areas ( @xmath122 , with @xmath69 being the characteristic length of the pulses ) , and smooth , slowly varying pulse envelopes are required .",
    "we now address the question of creating entanglement between the two squid systems .",
    "the entangled state is defined by @xmath123 where @xmath124 and @xmath125 are fixed angles . in order to obtain this state ,",
    "we apply the method of fractional stirap @xcite .",

    "our information transfer and entanglement scheme possesses the merits of both squid cavity qed quantum computing schemes @xcite and adiabatic evolution transfer schemes @xcite .",
    "the major advantages of squid cavity qed schemes are the simplicity of the coupling between the two squids via the cavity mode , the protection of squids from the interaction with the environment and thus the reduction of decoherence , and the technical simplicity of placing squid in cavities .",
    "the main advantage of adiabatic evolution transfer methods , such as stirap , is the robustness of the method for moderate fluctuations of the microwave pulse parameters .",
    "in addition , as long as the evolution remains adiabatic the excited states @xmath133 , with @xmath134 are minimally populated , while the cavity mode is only populated in the transient regime .",
    "the latter can be greatly suppressed , or completely avoided , by keeping the coupling @xmath79 greater than the rabi frequencies @xmath82 , with @xmath83 .",
    "therefore dissipation and decoherence can be reduced using this scheme .",
    "we have performed simulations for the squid presented in section ii . for coupling strengths for the rabi frequencies and the cavity coupling coefficient of the order of 1 - 5 ghz information transfer takes from 10 - 30 nsec while the creation of entangled states needs slightly larger times up to 50 nsec . a typical example for switching from state @xmath104 to state @xmath111",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "we also present the creation of the entangled state @xmath135 conclusion ----------    in summary , we have presented schemes for basic state - manipulations of a single rf - squid and two rf - squid qubits . in the first part of the paper",
    "we have considered a scheme for arbitrary rotation of a three - level rf - squid qubit .",
    "the rotation is performed by irradiating the squid with two microwave pulses that share the same time dependence .",
    "these pulses define a coupled and an uncoupled state out of the two squid states forming the qubit , and the rotation of the qubit results from the phase - shift on the coupled state caused by the applied microwave pulses .",
    "the main advantage of our proposed scheme is that it can be implemented for a large variety of pulse shapes and detunings , according to the capabilities of the experimentalists .    in the second part of the paper we have proposed schemes for information transfer and creation of entangled states between two rf - squids .",
    "these processes are mediated by a microwave cavity , so that the squids communicate via photon exchange through a cavity mode .",
    "we have applied an adiabatic population transfer scheme , therefore our method is robust with respect to the moderate fluctuations of the experimental parameters . for proper choice of the external rabi frequencies",
    "the excitation of the cavity field can be almost completely suppressed , hence the decoherence due to the imperfection of the cavity can be minimized .    in closing",
    ", we note that our schemes are quite general and can be applied to other areas of quantum computation where three - level qubits are used such as , for example , in atoms and trapped ions in cavities @xcite .",
