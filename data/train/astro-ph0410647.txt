    "despite their relative paucity , the highest column density absorption systems , damped lyman-@xmath0 systems ( where @xmath4 ) , are an important component of the high redshift ( @xmath5 ) universe since they account for most of the neutral gas available for star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the  21-cm hyperfine transition can provide an alternative and complementary view of dlas .",
    "presuming that the 21-cm and lyman-@xmath0 absorption arise in the same cloud complexes @xcite absorption trace the cold and total neutral hydrogen , respectively . ] , the column density [ ] of the absorbing gas in a homogeneous cloud is related to the velocity integrated optical depth , where @xmath6 , of the 21-cm line via @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 [ k ] is the spin temperature , @xmath9 is the depth of the line ( or r.m.s .",
    "noise in the case of a non - detection ) and @xmath10 and @xmath11 the flux density and covering factor of the background continuum source , respectively .",
    "as summarised by @xcite , 21-cm absorption line studies can face some difficulties compared with optical work : ( 1 ) in blind surveys the bandwidth of radio receiver / backend combinations only allows small redshift intervals to be searched for  absorption ; ( 2 ) terrestrial interference can be severe below 1.4ghz ; ( 3 ) if the spin temperature of the absorbing gas is high or if the background source size exceeds that of the absorption cloud(s ) , then the apparent optical depth can be considerably overestimated . despite these technical difficulties , 21-cm studies of dlas have provided information about the physical conditions of absorbers , including the kinematics , temperature and velocity distribution of the gas .",
    "one unresolved question concerns the typical size and structure of dlas , with models ranging from large , rapidly rotating proto - disks ( e.g. @xcite ) to small , merging sub - galactic systems ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "direct imaging by various groups ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) of the low-@xmath12 dla host - galaxies reveals a mix of spirals , dwarf and low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies .",
    "this ` mixed morphology ' picture of dla host - galaxies appears to be reflected in the nearby universe in a recent 21-cm @xmath13 emission study @xcite .    from a survey of 10 sources , in conjunction with the available literature , (",
    "* hereafter ) find both detections and non - detections of 21-cm absorption in dlas at @xmath14 , whereas the high-@xmath12 results are almost exclusively non - detections ( fig . [ kanekar ] , top ) .",
    "additionally , many of the @xmath15 dlas have host - galaxy identifications from optical imaging , given in table [ t2 ] . by combining the 21-cm optical depth with the total  column density from optical spectroscopy covering the damped lyman-@xmath0 line ,",
    "find low spin temperatures ( @xmath16 k ) , which are typical of the milky way and local spirals @xcite , in all cases where the absorber was identified as a spiral ( fig .",
    "[ kanekar ] ) .",
    "furthermore , all dlas at @xmath17 with temperatures @xmath18  k were found to be associated with dwarf or lsbs and interpreted the non - detections at high-@xmath12 ( @xmath19 ) as dlas with high @xmath8 .",
    "they therefore advocate a picture where the dla host - galaxy population is dominated by the warmer dwarfs and lsbs at high-@xmath12 and evolves to include a higher proportion of spirals at low-@xmath12 , thus satisfying one expectation of hierarchical galaxy formation scenarios .",
    "however , in many of these studies , particularly at high redshift , the covering factor , @xmath11 , of the background continuum is often assumed to be unity ( fig .",
    "[ kanekar ] , bottom  see also table [ t2 ] . ) .",
    "since @xmath11 plays an equal rle as @xmath8 in relating the column density to the observed optical depth profile , it is important to consider the robustness of this assumption , which is the aim of this article .",
    "in table [ t2 ] we summarise the previously published 21-cm searches to which we add the 3 non - detections detailed in appendix a. the optical depths are quoted for various resolutions between 0.6 and 17 .",
    "although there are 7 possible targets , we used the @xmath20 hours scheduled to concentrate on 3 of the 4 confirmed dlas ; 0432440 , 0438436 & 1228113 .",
    "0528250 was excluded due to its relatively low flux density .",
    "the redshifts of these dlas are known to within @xmath21 ( sara ellison , private communication ) , corresponding to @xmath22 mhz ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the observations were undertaken in january 2002 using the 70-cm receiver on the parkes 64-m antenna .",
    "we used the at conversion system with the multibeam correlator , giving a bandwidth of 8 mhz ( @xmath24 ) over 2048 channels ( i.e. a spectral dispersion of 2.8  per channel ) and position switching with 1  beam throw .",
    "the weather was clear and dry giving system temperatures typically between 60 and 150k .",
    "although we restricted our observations to night time , we experienced severe radio - frequency interference ( rfi ) in this band .",
    "the rfi consisted primarily of sharp ( @xmath25 ) ` spikes ' and broad ( @xmath26 ) ` humps ' .",
    "the humps in particular were found to shift in frequency between 120-s scans of the on- and off - source positions .",
    "therefore , attempts to subtract the off - source scans from their corresponding on - source scans merely introduced strong rfi variations in the residual spectrum with characteristic length scales @xmath27 , i.e.  the very scales typical of hi 21-cm absorption lines in dlas ( see table 2 ) . the stronger spikes were also often accompanied by a powerful ` ringing ' such that strong correlations between neighbouring channels could be seen to die away over @xmath28 scales .",
    "the data reduction was therefore carried out using software written specifically for the purpose of dealing with this rfi .",
    "the reduction steps are summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "the off - source scans were discarded and the on - source scans were low - pass filtered to provide a basic continuum shape which included the humps but ignored the spikes .",
    "the filtering scale was set so that @xmath29 absorption features could be recovered reliably .",
    "this continuum was then subtracted from the on - source scans leaving relatively flat residual spectra contaminated by the spikes .",
    "2 .   for each",
    "qso , all @xmath30 contributing scans were corrected to the heliocentric frame and re - dispersed to a common frequency scale with a dispersion of @xmath31 .",
    "a @xmath32 error array was constructed for each re - dispersed scan based on the rms in a sliding 20-channel window and channels with fluxes deviating by more than @xmath33 were flagged and ignored in further reduction steps .",
    "4 .   finally , the fluxes in corresponding channels in each scan were median filtered , values more than @xmath34 from the median rejected and the remaining values combined to form the weighted mean flux density and @xmath32 error arrays",

    "where no reliable data could be gathered from any of the contributing scans , we have assigned a normalized flux density of zero and an effectively infinite error . note also that the low - pass filter applied in stage ( i ) of the reduction procedure effectively prevents us from detecting absorption features with @xmath38 .",
