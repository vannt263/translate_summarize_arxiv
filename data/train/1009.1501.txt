    "in the last years there exist an increasing interest in the description of complex biological systems using simple physical models  @xcite . physical models for biological problems should contain the key ingredients to explain their basic phenomenology . in this sense",
    ", dna melting can be modeled using very simple statistical mechanics models  @xcite .",
    "one of the most successful is the one dimensional peyrard - bishop - dauxois ( pbd ) model  @xcite which with very few assumptions is able to reproduce the melting curves for different dna sequences .",
    "pbd model undergoes an entropic phase transition between the native closed state and a denatured one in which the dna strands are separated .",
    "the nature of this transition strongly depends on model parameter , so different versions of the model have been proposed in the last years .",
    "a virtue of the pbd model is that it allows to study not only the equilibrium properties of the molecule but also dynamical ones ; for instance , the formation and stability of the so called dna bubbles ( short open segments of the dna chain )  @xcite .",
    "due to its versatility , this simple model has been applied in other contexts beyond the study of the equilibrium melting curves .",
    "thus , it has been used to investigate the dna mechanical denaturation  @xcite and it has been specially successful in the modelling of the open regions in short dna hairpins  @xcite .",
    "this fact has motivated to extend the model to study non - homogeneous sequences and to try to correlate the _ dynamical _ behavior of the model to _ functional _ aspects of the dna chain . to be specific , it has been suggested that the localised dynamical excitations ( bubbles ) of the model are directly related with the protein - dna binding sites  @xcite .",
    "this point has been controversial , due to the simplicity of the pbd model assumptions  @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting improvements to the model is the inclusion of a barrier in the intra - base interaction term  @xcite .",
    "such barrier accounts for solvent interactions in the system .",
    "the addition of barriers modifies deeply the nature of the denaturation transition and the dynamics of the molecule . depending on the parameter values ,",
    "the transition become sharper , even in the harmonic stacking energy version .",
    "the transition width has not a trivial behavior and it deserves a more careful study . on the dynamical side ,",
    "the bubbles lifetime increases dramatically with the inclusion of this term and approaches to the experimental observations .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we characterize the melting transition of homogeneous sequences and the formation of bubbles phenomenon for a wide range of parameters ( section iv ) .",
    "this allows us to set suitable parameter values for next research .",
    "then , we focus on the problem of the relation between dynamics and function . in section v , we study a heterogeneous sequence which contains known information on the transcription process of dna to mrna ( a p5 virus promoter ) .",
    "we use principal component analysis of trajectories to identify the regions in the sequence which most relevantly contribute to the dynamical fluctuations of the molecule .",
    "these regions are the softest ones , from a mechanical point of view , and they correlate fairly well with the relevant biological sites . given its simplicity and efficiency , we propose to extend this analysis to other sequences in order to get insight over functionality of the different genome regions .",
    "we study a modification of the peyrard - bishop - dauxois model . in the pbd model",
    "the complexity of dna is reduced to the study of the dynamics of the @xmath0 base pairs of the molecule . for each base pair",
    "we define the variable @xmath1 associated to the distance between the bases .",
    "the total energy of the system is then approached by : @xmath2 .",
    "\\label{eq : ham}\\ ] ] here @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the index of a base pair and @xmath5 its reduced mass .    in this equation , we identify two energy potential terms : @xmath6 , an on - site potential one , and @xmath7 which accounts for inter - pairs interactions .",
    "the standard pbd model corresponds to a particular choice for these energy terms .",
    "the potential @xmath6 describes the interaction between the two bases of a pair .",
    "the pbd model uses a morse potential to account for such interaction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : v ] ) .",
    "this is an standard approximation for chemical bonds .",
    "@xmath8 where @xmath9 corresponds to the dissociation energy of the pair [ @xmath10 and @xmath11 and @xmath12 sets the amplitude of the potential well [ @xmath13 .",
    "see also that variable @xmath14 measures deviations of the base distance with respect to equilibrium , thus @xmath15 has a minimum for @xmath16 .",
    "an important contribution to the stability of dna molecule comes from the stacking of the bases .",
    "the potential @xmath7 describes the interaction between base pairs along the dna strand .",
    "the simplest approximation is to consider just harmonic interaction between adjacent pairs in the molecule .",
    "however this choice does not reproduce the observation of a sharp thermal denaturation curve . to solve this",
    ", the pbd model includes a position dependent nonlinear coupling constant @xmath17 the effect of this term , whose intensity is governed by @xmath18 is to change the effective coupling constant from @xmath19 to @xmath20 when one of the base pairs is displaced away from its equilibrium position .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 sets the scale length for this behavior .",
    "dna melting or denaturation refers to the separation of the two strands of the dna molecule to generate two single strands .",
    "the great merit of the pdb model defined in eqs .   and   is to reproduce the different melting curves observed in dna molecules .",
    "thus , it has been used as a solid starting point for many other statistical mechanics studies of dna .",
    "the melting process involves the breaking of hydrogen bonds between the bases . in order to study different dna sequences",
    "the pbd model also can include sequence dependent morse potential parameters : @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "it can be intuitively deduced from the fact that a - t pairs are linked by two hydrogen bonds meanwhile c - g ones are linked by three , thus forming a more stable link . following  @xcite in our simulations we will use @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "although recent works have considered more complex sequence dependence  @xcite , we will not introduce more complexity at this level in the model .",
    "we will work with a modified version of the pbd model to include solvent interaction .",
    "solvent interaction stabilizes open pair states by means of the hydrogen bonds that the base pairs may form with the solvent when opened  @xcite .",
    "such bonds have to be broken before the pair closes again .",
    "this effect can be included in a simple way with an effective barrier in the morse potential .",
    "the addition of the barrier has to avoid , as far as possible , any other effect in the morse well .",
    "hence , we have chosen the following definition for the on - site potential @xmath15 : @xmath26 this potential results from the addition of a gaussian barrier , whose height is controlled by @xmath27 , the position is given by @xmath28 and its width by @xmath29 . a reasonable election for such parameters",
    "is @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "figure  [ fig : v ] plots the intra - base potential @xmath33 for an a - t and a c - g base pair .",
    "in order to study the behavior of the system we have performed molecular dynamics numerical simulations of the langevin equation : @xmath34}{\\partial y_n } = \\xi_n(t ) , \\label{eq : lang_dyn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the mass of the pair , @xmath35 the effective damping of the system and @xmath36 accounts for thermal noise , @xmath37 and @xmath38 with @xmath39 the bath temperature .",
    "the equations were numerically integrated using the stochastic runge - kutta algorithm  @xcite .",
    "simulation of large a - t chain ( section iv ) used periodic boundary conditions in order to avoid any terminal effect . for the p5 promoter ( section v ) we used fixed boundary conditions which will be described below .",
    "to best characterize the phase transition we have computed the mean energy @xmath40 , and mean displacement @xmath41 defined as @xmath42 \\label{eq : energy}\\ ] ] and @xmath43 @xmath0 is the number of base pairs in the sequence to study and @xmath44 the total simulation time .",
    "we are also interested in computing the probability of being opened for each base .",
    "we define this as follows : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a threshold for opening that we choose just behind the barrier of the morse potential and @xmath47 is the heaviside step function ( @xmath48 for @xmath49 and @xmath50 for @xmath51 ) .",
    "thus @xmath52 indicates the fraction of time the @xmath4-th base is opened during the time @xmath44 .",
    "pca is a statistical method to extract information from a large set of data in a multidimensional phase space , allowing to reduce the dimensionality of the variables to those that include most of the fluctuations of the original system  @xcite .",
    "this is achieved by a change of coordinates in the phase space and the new coordinates are the so - called principal components , pcs .",
    "this method has become a standard tool in the analysis of trajectories in `` all - atom '' simulations of macromolecules @xcite .",
    "operationally , we have to build the @xmath53 correlation matrix @xmath54 diagonalising this matrix we obtain an ordered set of eigenvalues ( @xmath55 ) with their corresponding eigenvectors ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "eigenvalue @xmath57 gives the amount of fluctuations which corresponds to eigenvector @xmath58 , thus the new coordinates are ordered in such a way that the few first ones retains most of the fluctuations of the system .",
    "it is useful to define a frequency @xmath59 associated to each eigenvalue @xmath57 and given by @xmath60 from this point of view , the larger fluctuations will correspond to the lowest frequencies .",
    "it can be proved that in the low temperature limit these frequencies converge to the normal mode frequencies of the system .",
    "normal mode analysis has also used in the detection of relevant motions in coarse - grained model of proteins @xcite .",
    "in this section we will study the melting transition of a homogeneous chain of a - t pair bases .",
    "although there are some studies on the influence of the different parameters in the transition , up to our knowledge , there is not a systematic scan over the parameter space . in particular , when the barrier is included on the morse potential a clear narrowing of the transition is observed ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : melting ] ) .",
    "the same effect is expected when the @xmath18 parameter is increased .",
    "thus , one of the first problems when dealing with this modified pbd model is to find suitable model parameters .",
    "this is mainly done by adjusting the theoretical melting temperatures to the experimental ones .",
    "the melting temperature @xmath61 is usually defined as the temperature at which the dna strands are half denatured . for a homogeneous a - t chain ,",
    "the melting transition has been reported around @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "one should be aware that , in general , the melting temperature depends on the length of the sequence , base composition , topological structure and salt concentration .",
    "thus , it is difficult to predict the exact transition temperature of a given sequence . in the case of the uniform chain",
    "the melting temperature depends strongly on salt concentration , which is not explicitly included in this mesoscopic model .",
    "usual parameters for the standard pbd model can be found in references  @xcite for instance . following previous findings and guided by our numerical simulation results",
    "we choose the following set of values for studying the standard model : @xmath63 da , @xmath64ev , @xmath65 , @xmath66ev@xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( these values are slightly different to those given in  @xcite ) .",
    "if barrier is included we modify the value of @xmath9 to obtain the same @xmath61 .",
    "thus , in this case @xmath70ev , and @xmath71ev , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .    the melting transition curve for the model with and without solvation barrier is shown in fig .  [ fig : melting ] for a homogeneous a - t sequence with @xmath74 .",
    "at high temperature is observed the expected linear behavior of a free gaussian polymer chain ; i.e. the completely unzipped state .",
    "the numerical determination of the melting temperature is not a trivial issue .",
    "for the case of a uniform chain , we use the following computational criteria to determine the melting temperature and transition width from the @xmath75 and @xmath76 curves .",
    "first we define two temperatures .",
    "the larger one , @xmath77 , gives the onset of the linear behavior in @xmath78 which indicates that the chain is completely melted .",
    "the other one , @xmath79 estimates the beginning of the transition defined as the temperature for which @xmath80 , i.e. when the chain can be considered to be by average in the barrier position .",
    "then we define the transition width @xmath81 and the melting temperature as @xmath82 .",
    "it is interesting to briefly discuss on the effect of the main model parameters in the melting transition and the dynamical behavior of the system .",
    "high values of @xmath9 , the morse potential dissociation energy , produces also high @xmath61 .",
    "parameters @xmath20 and @xmath18 , set the stacking interaction between adjacent bases .",
    "its effect in @xmath61 and @xmath83 can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : tm ] and  [ fig : dt ] .",
    "a suitable melting temperature and transition width is obtained at high @xmath20 values ( thus we chose @xmath66ev/@xmath84 ) and moderate @xmath18 ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "moderate @xmath18 are biologically satisfactory and avoid the very narrow bubbles observed for high @xmath18 values . with respect to the solvation barrier",
    "its presence makes bubbles live longer .",
    "thus a complete separation of the strands is also facilitated leading to a decrease of the melting temperature ( this change can be counterbalanced by an increasing in the @xmath9 value ) .",
    "the inclusion of the barrier also reduces the width of the transition , allowing the election of moderate @xmath18 values .",
    "pca provide us another method to analyse the phase transition .",
    "figure  [ fig : pcafreq ] shows the spectrum of effective frequencies as defined in eq .",
    "for the uniform a - t chain . at low temperatures , a sharp band of linear waves excitations close to the ground state",
    "is clearly identified . at very low temperatures ,",
    "the frequencies are given by the dispersion relation  @xcite : @xmath86 .",
    "\\label{eq : dispersion}\\ ] ] thus , the gap for the lowest mode is controlled by the intra - base potential parameters . in this limit the pc eigenvectors are the normal modes of a homogeneous array . as temperature increases , the nonlinear excitations are more important .",
    "such nonlinear modes are responsible of the larger fluctuations and correspond to the larger eigenvalues or lower frequencies . as we approach the melting temperature a soft mode goes to zero ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pcafreq ] ) , the chain is not pinned by an on - site potential and every strand moves freely . hence at high temperature the frequencies are those of a free gaussian chain with coupling given by the stacking parameter @xmath20 : @xmath87 .",
    "\\label{eq : dispersion2}\\ ] ] note that the zero mode corresponds to the largest wavelength .",
    "figure  [ fig : zerom ] shows the temperature evolution of this mode frequency .",
    "the curve can be fitted using a critical behavior function @xmath88 with @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the characterization of the order of the phase transition is a difficult issue  @xcite . to our knowledge",
    "dynamic exponents for this family of models are not known .",
    "one of the more interesting aspects of dna molecule amenable to be studied in the framework of the pbd mode , is the formation and stability of the so called dna bubbles ( short open segments of the dna chain ) .",
    "the onset of such states have an important role in the understanding of the operation of dna molecules .",
    "we observe that the inclusion of a solvation barrier in the model has a dramatic effect in the dynamics of the system increasing the lifetime of bubbles .",
    "figure  [ fig : bubbles ] compares molecular dynamics numerical simulations for a model with barrier to another without barrier and at @xmath91 .",
    "as expected the presence of barriers modifies the kinetics of base opening and further closing .",
    "the individual trajectories of the different bases clearly show this behavior .",
    "although the profile of the bubbles is similar in the two cases , the non - barrier dynamics is completely different from that with barrier . without a barrier the opening of the base pair corresponds to a large amplitude oscillation along the morse potential , and an easy closing",
    "is favoured . with barrier",
    ", the kinetics is controlled by the presence of two equilibrium states separated by the solvation barrier .",
    "closing events are more difficult and bubbles live longer .",
    "although in this way , we approach to experimental values of lifetime bubbles ( of the order of ns ) , this fact makes the simulations more difficult since it is required very long runs to have good statistics .",
    "we see that parameter @xmath18 affects the cooperativity between open bases and then the bubbles lifetime and width . a large @xmath18 produces long live bubbles but extremely narrow ones ( one or two bases ) , as those shown in reference  @xcite with @xmath92 . with this value of @xmath18 ,",
    "the transition is extremely narrow and , after a long transient , bubbles nucleate to drive the unzipping of the whole chain .",
    "a moderate value , @xmath68 , is good enough to get both longer and wider bubbles ( four to ten bases ) , as shown in figures .",
    "a promoter is a region of the dna sequence where the transcription to mrna is initiated and controlled . in prokaryotic cells , regions of -10 and -35 bp ( upstream from the transcription start site )",
    "are the most important sites for transcription regulation . in this section",
    "we analyse the p5 core promoter which has been widely studied in the literature  @xcite .",
    "we show that the pca of langevin trajectories of the molecule clearly identifies the biologically relevant sites .",
    "the sequence of the p5 promoter is given by the 69 pb : 5-gtgcccatttagggtatatatggccgagtgagcgagc aggatctccattttgaccgcaaatttgaacg-3. we will perform numerical simulations of this sequence ( parameter values for c - g and a - t base pairs have been given previously ) . in order to avoid unphysical denaturation events at low temperature due to finite size effects  @xcite ,",
    "we apply the following boundary conditions : first we add 10 c - g bp sequences to the ends of the promoter to create _",
    "hard _ boundaries .",
    "second , we set the extremes to 0 ( closed ) to avoid the complete opening of the chain .",
    "figure  [ fig : p5 ] shows the evolution of the pc frequency spectrum with temperature .",
    "several features distinguish these curves from the homogeneous case . for low temperatures ,",
    "two bands corresponding to a - t ( lower band ) and c - g ( upper band ) links are clearly identified .",
    "the eigenvectors are localised around rich regions in both kinds of complementary pairs . at intermediate temperatures",
    "the gap between both bands disappears and the eigenvectors broaden .",
    "c - g pairs surrounded by a - t ones are more likely to open and frequencies diminish .",
    "close to transition ( @xmath93 ) , several modes detach to low frequencies .",
    "the first three modes are strongly localised and show peaks in four regions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : p5_comp ] ) .",
    "these modes represent the `` softest '' regions of the sequence , are related with high probability of opening and drive the unzipping .",
    "this picture is validated by the study of the three first eigenvectors ( the large eigenvalue or small frequency ones ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : p5_comp ] shows the measured probability of opening in the sequence , defined by eq .  , and the computed eigenvectors .",
    "an excellent correlation between both figures is observed .",
    "region + 1 corresponds to the transition starting site ( tss ) whereas regions -30 and -40 correspond to the binding sites of transcription factors i.e. a region rich in a / t pairs like the tata - box . localised eigenvectors span over regions of ten base pairs which fairly correspond with the width of the bubbles .",
    "figure  [ fig : bubblesp5 ] plots a typical trajectory , showing a few bubbles mainly at the regions pointed by the pc eigenvectors .",
    "note that at this temperature very few opening events occur , so a precise statistics on bubble formation becomes difficult .",
    "however , pc analysis gives a good account of these sites even with the presence of a few bubbles .",
    "interestingly , the third eigenvalue shows a clear correlation between region close to tata box and the tss .",
    "this represents motion fluctuations that involve both regions .",
    "thus , modification of one of them could interfere in the fluctuations in the other opening a channel for the regulation of transcription .",
    "we have studied the dynamics of a dna molecule using the pbd model with solvation interaction .",
    "solvation interaction is modeled by including a barrier in the usual on - site morse potential .",
    "first we have analyzed the melting transition in an a - t homogeneous chain .",
    "we conclude that the inclusion of the barrier not only modifies the phase transition but also has a great influence in the dynamics of localised excitations ( bubbles ) . in combination with the non linear parameter @xmath18 , the width and lifetime of bubbles can be tuned .",
    "we find a set of parameters which will be suitable for future studies with this model .",
    "we have applied the model to an inhomogeneous sequence with biological meaning , a virus promoter .",
    "the study of trajectories using principal component analysis allows us to detect the biological relevant sites without the need of long molecular dynamics runs .",
    "we have found that the softest modes of the pc spectrum are highly localised in those sites .",
    "even more , these sites have been also detected as the most likely to be opened in bubbles  @xcite . in this work",
    "we can not elucidate the controversy on whether the dna can direct its own transcription as was suggested in  @xcite and then make use of theoretical methods to obtain the functional regions .",
    "however , we can obtain from the mesoscopic pbd model some regions which are more sensible to the formation of bubbles ( as extracted from the eigenvectors of the pca ) .",
    "of course , the simplicity of the model can not take into account other effects , like the flexibility of dna molecule , but it is able to tackle those related with the sequence",
    ".    finally , we stress the use of a tool , the pca , to the analysis of statistical mechanics simulations of simple models to obtain useful information on linear and nonlinear excitations and the relation with its phase transition ."
