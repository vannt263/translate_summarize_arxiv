    "since its introduction in 1990 @xcite , multiphoton microscopy ( mpm ) rapidly evolved to become the workhorse for 3d fluorescence imaging in many laboratories .",
    "mpm is arguably one of the most influential recent inventions in optical microscopy because it offers a combination of minimally invasive imaging with high resolution , thin optical sectioning and deep penetration in highly scattering samples such as biological tissues @xcite .",
    "+ these properties all stem from the process of multiphoton fluorescence excitation . in order to achieve efficient multiphoton excitation",
    ", photons need to be concentrated both in space by focussing the excitation beam , and in time by using pulsed laser sources .",
    "fluorescence is therefore only excited in a narrow volume .",
    "moreover , because the excitation spectra of common fluorescent molecules are in the visible spectrum , the wavelengths used for mpm are in the near - infrared such that optical sample damage is much reduced @xcite .    a second important development in optical microscopy has been the development of super - resolution microscopy which achieves resolutions beyond the diffraction limit .",
    "in essence , super - resolved imaging requires the sample to respond non - linearly to the illumination light .",
    "such a non - linearity can be achieved by , among other techniques , saturation of excitation @xcite and stimulation emission depletion ( sted ) @xcite .",
    "bringing super - resolution to mpm has the potential to enable studying biological samples at the depths offered by mpm with a resolution beyond the diffraction limit .",
    "sted has been applied successfully for two - photon microscopy ( 2 pm ) , but only to improve the lateral resolution @xcite . moreover ,",
    "sted requires the use of a high - intensity visible wavelength depletion beam , increasing the invasiveness of the method .",
    "although sted microscopy can also improve the axial resolution beyond the diffraction limit @xcite , it requires a carefully aligned and relatively complex optical system , often including an additional depletion laser source .    in this work",
    ", we present a simple approach to achieve 3d super - resolution in mpm , based on saturation of fluorescence excitation @xcite .",
    "this method can easily be implemented on an existing multiphoton microscope , as it only requires ( a ) temporal modulation of the excitation beam using an off - the - shelf intensity modulator , and ( b ) demodulation of the detected fluorescence signal with an electronic lock - in amplifier .",
    "hence , no additional laser sources or beam shaping optics are required , and only near - infrared light is incident on the sample .",
    "images of fluorescent microspheres on a coverslip prove that this technique can be implemented successfully in mpm and improves not only the lateral but also the axial resolution .",
    "further experiments with microspheres integrated in hela cells produced encouraging results demonstrating the feasibility of this method for _ in vitro _ studies .",
    "the technique proposed in this work is based on the saturation of the probability of excitation of the fluorophore in mpm . until recently",
    ", saturation has been considered harmful for imaging and has been avoided @xcite .",
    "it is possible , however , to show that in a saturation regime , the relation between the intensity of excitation and the emitted fluorescence intensity is no longer linear and contains nonlinearities that can be used to improve the lateral as well as the axial resolution @xcite .    in a two - photon excitation process , assuming a delay between pulses much longer than the fluorescence lifetime , the probability of exciting a fluorophore at a given position with one excitation laser pulse is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a coefficient which depends on the pulse s shape and duration , and on the repetition rate of the laser , @xmath2 is the two - photon absorption cross - section of the fluorophore , @xmath3 the average power of the excitation beam and @xmath4 is the illumination point spread function . to extract the nonlinearities that appear when saturation occurs ,",
    "a temporal modulation of frequency @xmath5 is applied to the excitation beam @xcite .",
    "the probability of excitation can then be written @xmath6 ^ 2 psf^2 ( x , y , z ) } , \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 .    at high excitation power ,",
    "higher order harmonics in the fluorescence signal will become non - negligible , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure1](a ) .    by developing the @xmath8 term up to the @xmath9 order in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , and rearranging the expression , the power in the harmonics can be calculated @xmath10    these equations show that the harmonics in the detected fluorescence signal contain terms with the fourth and sixth powers of the illumination psf . in standard two - photon microscopy , the detected signal contains @xmath11 .",
    "hence , the resolution is improved by at least a factor of @xmath12 when using the third harmonic .",
    "figure [ figure1](b ) shows the dependence of the harmonics strength @xmath13 on the illumination intensity .",
    "( b ) power in the @xmath14-th harmonic of the detected fluorescence signal ( @xmath13 ) for increasing power on the sample.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    by making the appropriate linear combination of the harmonics in eq .",

    "the experimental setup , shown in fig .  [ figure2 ] , is built around a commercial two - photon microscope ( model fv1000-mpe , based on a bx61wi upright microscope body , olympus corp . ) .",

    "in this work , we demonstrated experimentally that saturation of fluorescence excitation can be exploited to obtain a 3d resolution improvement in mpm .",
    "implementation of this technique on an existing mpm system is straightforward since it only requires modulating the excitation beam and demodulating the detected fluorescence signal .",
    "the method is also cost - effective because it does not require additional laser sources or microscope objectives to improve the 3d resolution .",
    "moreover , the technique does not employ delicate 3d beam - shaping optics , which are sensitive to misalignment over time .",
    "images of fluorescent microspheres on a coverslip and integrated in hela cells show that resolution is indeed improved in all three spatial dimensions by a factor of @xmath12 when imaging at the demodulated third harmonic of the detected fluorescence signal .",
    "furthermore , we showed that the 3d resolution can be improved by an additional factor of @xmath18 when the appropriate linear combination is made of the first three harmonics .",
    "this linear combination of harmonics is made by an analog circuit such that no subsequent signal processing is required . for comparison",
    ", our super - resolution mpm obtains the same lateral resolution as a @xmath94 nm illuminated linear confocal microscope ( assuming the same beam characteristics and objective ) , while conserving the advantages of classical mpm ( i.e. near - infrared illumination and increased depth of penetration ) .    to obtain the required saturation regime and get a sufficiently high signal - to - noise ratio for the harmonic signals , an average illumination power of @xmath58mw at @xmath30 nm was delivered on the sample .",
    "interestingly , this rather modest illumination power suffices to obtain a near twofold 3d resolution enhancement in mpm .",
    "moreover , since the sample is illuminated only at near - infrared wavelengths , our approach is likely to be less invasive , in terms of photo - toxicity , than the super - resolution techniques based on sted .    with the present acquisition parameters , relatively few modulation periods are measured at every image voxel .",
    "even though the resulting signal - to - noise ratio was sufficient for imaging , there is room for improvement by increasing the number of periods of modulation of the excitation signal per pixel .",
    "this can be done by increasing the pixel dwell time ( if the acquisition time is not critical ) or by using a higher modulation frequency ( but keeping a sufficient number of pulses per modulation period ) . an improved signal - to - noise ratio could allow using a lower illumination power while still obtaining a sufficiently strong signal to reconstruct the image .",
    "this could be particularly interesting to investigate for future work , especially for _ in vivo _ applications where the power damage threshold is critical .",
    "theoretically , the resolution improvement is unlimited since higher harmonics than the third one can be used .",
    "however , as for all super - resolution methods based on saturation of the excitation or sted , the attainable resolution is ultimately limited by the damage threshold of the sample . at high illumination powers , photobleaching and phototoxicity become critical in biological samples .",
    "this problem can be reduced using fluorophores with high two - photon absorption cross section or quantum dots , provided that their fluorescence lifetime is sufficiently short compared to the modulation period .",
