    "the generally well - accepted notion of a black hole is deeply rooted in the general relativist community , although a considerable number of particle and condensed matter physicists view the respective notion of event horizons with some suspicion and alarm @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , one still encounters the existence of misconceptions and a certain ambiguity inherent to the schwarzschild solution in the literature ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) . despite the fact that the evidence of the existence of black holes in the universe is very convincing , a certain amount of scepticism regarding the observational data",
    "is still encountered @xcite .",
    "this scepticism has inspired new and fascinating ideas .",
    "in particular , models replacing the interior schwarzschild solution with compact objects , and thus , doing away with the problems of the singularity at the origin and the event horizon , have been proposed to some extent in the literature .",
    "however , we do emphasize that the interior structure of realistic black holes has not been satisfactorily determined , and is still open to considerable debate . in this line of thought ,",
    "an interesting alternative to black holes has recently been proposed , namely , the `` gravastar '' ( _ grav_itational _ va_cuum _ star _ ) picture developed by mazur and mottola @xcite . in this model , and in the related picture developed by laughlin _ et al _ @xcite , the quantum vacuum undergoes a phase transition at or near the location where the event horizon is expected to form .",
    "the mazur - mottola model is constituted by an onion - like structure with five layers , including two thin - shells , with surface stresses @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the surface energy density and @xmath6 is the surface tangential pressure .",
    "the interior of the solution is replaced by a segment of de sitter space , which is then matched to a finite thickness shell of stiff matter with the equation of state @xmath7 .",
    "the latter is then matched to an external schwarzschild vacuum with @xmath8 .",
    "related models , analyzed in a different context have also been considered by dymnikova @xcite .",
    "although mazur and mottola argued for the thermodynamic stability of their configuration , the full dynamic stability against spherically symmetric perturbations was carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite , through a simplified construction of the mazur - mottola model .",
    "the configuration was simplified to a three - layer solution , i.e. , a de sitter interior solution was matched to a schwarzschild exterior solution at a junction surface , comprising of a thin shell with surface stresses @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "it was found that many equations of state exist that imply the dynamical stability of the gravastar configurations .",
    "the latter dynamical stability was generalized to an anti - de sitter or de sitter interior and a schwarzschild-(anti)-de sitter or reissner ",
    "nordstrm exterior @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , by disregarding the presence of thin shells , a generalized class of gravastar models was analyzed .",
    "it was found , using these models , that gravastars can not be perfect fluid spheres , and that they necessarily exhibit anisotropic pressures .",
    "specific stable solutions , with respect to axial perturbations , possessing continuous pressures were also further explored @xcite . in this context ,",
    "one may also replace the interior de sitter spacetime with a solution governed by the dark energy equation of state , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "note that the particular case of @xmath11 reduces to the de sitter solution , and for @xmath12 , one ends up with phantom energy , an exotic cosmic fluid which violates the null energy condition .",
    "now , the notion of dark energy is that of a spatially homogeneous cosmic fluid , however , inhomogeneities may arise through gravitational instabilities .",
    "thus , these inhomogeneous solutions , denoted as _ dark energy stars _",
    "@xcite , may possibly originate from density fluctuations in the cosmological background .",
    "note that now the pressure in the equation of state @xmath13 is a radial pressure , and the transverse pressure may be determined from the field equations , as emphasized in refs .",
    "@xcite , in a rather different context .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , motivated by low energy string theory , an alternative model was constructed by replacing the de sitter regime with an interior solution governed by a chaplygin gas equation of state , interpreted as a born - infeld phantom gravastar . in this context , the extension of the latter born - infeld gravastar variation to rather more general nonlinear electrodynamic models shall prove extremely interesting , and this is , in fact the analysis of the present paper .",
    "it is interesting to note that nonlinear electrodynamics has recently been revived , mainly due to the fact that these models appear as effective theories at different levels of string / m - theory , in particular , in d@xmath14branes and supersymmetric extensions , and non - abelian generalizations ( we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) , and have enjoyed a wide variety of applicability , namely , in cosmology @xcite .",
    "traversable wormholes have also been explored in nonlinear electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "it was found that regular pure magnetic evolving wormholes exist @xcite .",
    "however , static spherically symmetric and stationary axisymmetric traversable wormholes have been ruled out , mainly due to the presence of event horizons , the non - violation of the null energy condition at the throat , and due to the imposition of the principle of finiteness , which states that a satisfactory theory should avoid physical quantities becoming infinite @xcite .",
    "in fact , the born - infeld model was inspired mainly on the principle of finiteness , in order to remedy the fact that the standard picture of a point particle possesses an infinite self - energy @xcite .",
    "later , plebaski presented other examples of nonlinear electrodynamic lagrangians @xcite , and showed that the born - infeld theory satisfies physically acceptable requirements .",
    "it was in nonlinear electrodynamics that the first exact regular black hole solutions to the einstein field equation were found @xcite . in this context , magnetic black holes and monopoles @xcite , regular electrically charged black holes of a hybrid type containing a magnetically charged core @xcite , and electrically charged structures with a regular de sitter center @xcite , have been found .",
    "in this work , we are interested in the construction of a wide variety of gravastar models coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics . using the @xmath0 representation , we consider specific forms of lagrangians describing magnetic gravastars , which may be interpreted as self - gravitating magnetic monopoles with a charge @xmath1 .",
    "using the @xmath2 formulation of nonlinear electrodynamics , it is easier to find electric solutions , and considering specific structural functions we further explore the characteristics and physical properties of the solutions .",
    "we match these interior nonlinear electrodynamic geometries to an exterior schwarzschild spacetime , thus avoiding the problematic issues related to the singularities and event horizons .",
    "this paper is organized in the following manner : in section [ sec1 ] , we outline the field equations , and analyze some characteristics of the solutions . in section [ sec2 ] , we consider the @xmath0 representation of nonlinear electrodynamics , and explore specific magnetic solutions in some detail . in section",
    "[ sec3 ] , we outline the dual @xmath2 formalism and extensively analyze electric gravastar solutions . in section [ sec : conclusion ] , we conclude .",

    "the latter depends on a single invariant @xmath0 given by @xmath19 @xcite , where the antisymmetric tensor @xmath20 is the electromagnetic field . in einstein - maxwell theory , the lagrangian takes the form @xmath21 .",
    "however , we consider more general choices for the electromagnetic lagrangians .",
    "note that the lagrangian may also be constructed using a second invariant @xmath22 , where the asterisk @xmath23 denotes the hodge dual with respect to @xmath24 .",
    "however , we only consider @xmath0 , as this provides solutions that are interesting enough .",
    "varying the action with respect to the gravitational field provides the einstein field equations @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the einstein tensor , and the stress - energy tensor , @xmath27 , is given by @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",

    "now , it is a simple matter , using equation ( [ 4dim - stress - energy ] ) in an orthonormal reference frame , to verify that @xmath41 .",
    "thus , using the einstein field equation , and taking into account equations ( [ rho ] ) and ( [ pr ] ) , we have @xmath42 , which provides the solution @xmath43 .",
    "the constant @xmath44 may be absorbed by defining a new time coordinate , so that without a loss of generality , we may consider @xmath45 .    for notational and computational convenience",

    "the stress - energy tensor , in the orthonormal reference frame , assumes the diagonal form @xmath49 , in which @xmath50 is the energy density , @xmath51 is the radial pressure , and @xmath52 is the lateral pressure measured in the orthogonal direction to the radial direction .",
    "thus , the einstein field equations finally take the form @xmath53 we will consider @xmath54 and @xmath55 , as @xmath56 , to ensure the regularity of the stress - energy tensor components .    one may now define the factor @xmath57 as the _ gravity profile _ , as it is related to the radial component of proper acceleration that an observer must maintain in order to remain at rest at constant @xmath35 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "note that the radial component of proper acceleration is given by @xmath60 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "thus , the convention used is that @xmath57 is positive for an inwardly gravitational attraction , and negative for an outward gravitational repulsion @xcite . for gravastars",
    "an essential condition is that they have a repulsive nature , i.e. , @xmath61 , which for the present case amounts to imposing the following condition @xmath62}<0   \\ , .",
    "\\label{gravprofile}\\ ] ] we emphasize that what is required from a spherically symmetric solution of the einstein equations to be a gravastar model , is the presence of a repulsive nature of the interior solution , which is characterized by the notion of the `` gravity profile '' .",
    "the interior solution is then matched to an exterior schwarzschild solution which is outlined further ahead .",
    "we also explore the energy conditions , in particular , the weak energy condition ( wec ) , which is defined as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a timelike vector .",
    "the fact that the stress energy tensor is diagonal will be helpful , so that the following three conditions are imposed @xmath65 from the first inequality , we verify that @xmath66 is imposed .",
    "note that @xmath67 , so that the second inequality is readily satisfied .",
    "relatively to the third inequality , consider the factor @xmath68 where for simplicity , @xmath69 is defined as @xmath70 thus , in summary , to ensure the wec , we simply need to impose that @xmath71 throughout the spacetime .    in the present case ,",
    "the term @xmath72 is equivalent to the anisotropy factor which is defined as @xmath73 .",
    "the latter is a measure of the pressure anisotropy of the fluid comprising the gravastar .",
    "@xmath74 corresponds to the particular case of an isotropic pressure gravastar , which in our case reduces to the trivial case of @xmath75 , as may be verified from equation ( [ wec2 ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath76 represents a force due to the anisotropic nature of the stellar model , which is repulsive , i.e. , being outward directed if @xmath77 , and attractive if @xmath78 .",
    "we consider a cut - off of the stress - energy tensor at a junction radius @xmath79 , much in the spirit of the original mazur - mottola gravastar model @xcite .",
    "for instance , consider for simplicity that the exterior solution is the schwarzschild spacetime , given by @xmath80 @xmath81 may be interpreted as the gravastar s total mass . in this case the spacetimes given by the metrics ( [ generalmetric ] ) and ( [ metricvacuumlambda ] ) are matched at @xmath79 , and one has a thin shell surrounding the gravastar .",
    "note that to avoid the presence of an event horizon , we need to impose @xmath82 . using the darmois - israel formalism , the surface stresses are given by @xmath83 where the overdot denotes a derivative with respect to the proper time , @xmath84 , and the prime represents , for the present case , a derivative with respect to @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath5 is the surface energy density and @xmath6 the surface pressure ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "the static case is given by taking into account @xmath85 .",

    "it is also important to mention that for a self - gravitating object ( solution to einstein s equations ) to be considered as a possible alternative to a black hole , which was one of the original ideas behind the gravastar model , the surface redshift should be able to reach values that are higher than that of ordinary objects .",
    "the surface redshift is defined by @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the fractional change between the observed wavelength , @xmath92 , and the emitted wavelength , @xmath93 .",
    "thus , according to our notation , the surface value takes the form @xmath94 now , for a static perfect fluid sphere the surface redshift is not larger than @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "however , for anisotropic spheres this value may be larger @xcite . for the present case of nonlinear electrodynamic gravastars , the bounds on the surface redshift , in principle , place restrictions on the characteristic parameters of the nonlinear electrodynamic theory , which can be analyzed on a case by case , but we will not pursue this here .",
    "a number of nonexistence theorems prohibiting regular electrically charged nonlinear electrodynamic structures have been proposed .",
    "these basically state that any @xmath96 approaching the maxwell weak field limit , @xmath97 , such that @xmath98 , prohibit electrically charged static spherically symmetric geometries with a regular center @xcite .",
    "however , it has been argued that due to the fact that the energy density attains a maximum at the center , the validity of the maxwell field limit at the center can not be expected @xcite .",
    "another important feature worth mentioning , is that imposing the maxwell limit at the center and at infinity , inevitably leads to a branching of @xmath96 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "however , this issue should not bother us , as in this paper we consider matchings of interior nonlinear electrodynamic solutions to an exterior schwarzschild spacetime , and thus the range considered generally implies a monotonic behavior of @xmath96 as a function of @xmath0 . as the maxwellian limit is not imposed at the center , but rather at infinity , the nonlinear electrodynamic constructions outlined in this work do not possess the weak field limit in the specific range of interest , i.e. , @xmath99 , so that we are at a certain freedom to consider rather general lagrangians , in particular , those that do not obey the maxwellian limit for @xmath100 .",
    "now , taking into account the electromagnetic field equations , equations ( [ em - field ] ) , from @xmath101 , we obtain @xmath102 and @xmath103 , so that we have @xmath104 and @xmath105 . from @xmath106",

    "thus , taking into account the _ principle of finiteness _ , which states that a satisfactory theory should avoid physical quantities becoming infinite ,",
    "the message that one may extract is that for the present geometry , both electric and magnetic fields can not coexist .",
    "one should either consider a pure electric field or a pure magnetic field .",
    "we emphasize that the principle of finiteness , which is a basic requisite of nonlinear electrodynamic theory , is related to physically measured entities or physical quantities , independently of the particular basis , as introduced by born and infeld and later retaken by plabanski , such as the electric and magnetic fields .",
