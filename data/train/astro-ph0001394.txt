    "already in the late 1960s it was becoming apparent that the rapid increase in quasar comoving space densities with redshift did not continue beyond @xmath9 .",
    "several authors suggested the existence of a redshift cutoff beyond which a real decrease in quasar densities occurs , unrelated to observational selection effects ( sandage 1972 ) .",
    "numerous studies have now shown that this is indeed the case .",
    "for example , schmidt , schneider , & gunn ( 1995a ) , applying the @xmath10 test to a well - defined sample of 90 quasars detected by their  emission in the palomar transit grism survey , conclude that the comoving quasar density decreases from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "warren , hewett , & osmer ( 1994 ) show that the quasar space density falls by a factor of a few between @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "shaver et  al .",
    "( 1996b ) show a similar decrease in space density exists for radio - loud quasars , implying that the decline is not simply due to obscuration by intervening galaxies .",
    "an unresolved question , however , is how the decline compares between the optically - selected and radio - selected populations .",
    "two definitions are generally used to demarcate radio - quiet and radio - loud quasars .",
    "one criterion is the radio - optical ratio @xmath15 of the specific fluxes at restframe 6  cm ( 5  ghz ) and 4400   ( kellerman et  al .",
    "1989 ) ; radio - loud sources typically have @xmath16 in the range @xmath17 while most radio - quiet sources have @xmath18",
    ". however , peacock , miller , & longair ( 1986 ) and miller , peacock , & mead ( 1990 ) point out that @xmath15 is physically meaningful as a discriminating parameter _ only _ if radio and optical luminosities are linearly correlated .",
    "this is apparently not the case ; no linear correlation has been observed for radio - loud quasars ( stocke et  al .",
    "1992 ) and the fraction of optically - faint , optically - selected quasars which are radio - loud would be higher if radio and optical properties were linearly correlated ( peacock et  al .",
    "1986 ; miller et  al . 1990 ) .",
    "the second definition , which can result in ambiguous taxonomy for some quasars , is to divide the populations at some restframe radio luminosity ( miller et  al .",
    "1990 ; schneider et  al .",
    "different authors use slightly different luminosities to discriminate the populations ; for what follows , we identify radio - loudness using the gregg et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) cutoff value for the 1.4  ghz specific luminosity , @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "differential evolution between the radio - quiet and radio - loud quasar populations would be a fascinating result , which could change ( or challenge ) our understanding of different types of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "for example , wilson & colbert ( 1995 ) propose a model whereby radio - loud agn are products of coalescing supermassive black holes in galaxy mergers ; such a process would result in rapidly spinning black holes , capable of generating highly - collimated jets and powerful radio sources .",
    "such a model could naturally explain a lag ( if there is indeed one ) between the appearance of powerful radio - loud quasars in the early universe and the more common radio - quiet quasars .",

    "<S> we report on two programs to address differential evolution between the radio - loud and radio - quiet quasar populations at high ( @xmath0 ) redshift . </S>",
    "<S> both programs entail studying the radio properties of optically - selected quasars . </S>",
    "<S> first , we have observed 32 optically - selected , high - redshift ( @xmath0 ) quasars with the vla at 6  cm ( 5  ghz ) . </S>",
    "<S> these sources comprise a statistically complete and well - understood sample . </S>",
    "<S> we detect four quasars above our 3@xmath1 limit of @xmath2 0.15  mjy , which is sufficiently sensitive to detect all radio - loud quasars at the probed redshift range . </S>",
    "<S> second , we have correlated 134 @xmath0 quasars , comprising all such sources that we are aware of as of mid-1999 , with first and nvss . </S>",
    "<S> these two recent 1.4  ghz vla sky surveys reach 3@xmath1 limits of approximately 0.6  mjy and 1.4  mjy respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we identify a total of 15 @xmath0 quasars , of which six were not previously known to be radio - loud . </S>",
    "<S> the depth of these surveys does not reach the radio - loud / radio - quiet demarcation luminosity density ( @xmath3 ) at the redshift range considered ; this correlation therefore only provides a lower limit to the radio - loud fraction of quasars at high - redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the two programs together identify eight new radio - loud quasars at @xmath0 , a significant increase over the seven currently in the published literature . </S>",
    "<S> we find no evidence for radio - loud fraction depending on optical luminosity for @xmath4 at @xmath5 , or for @xmath6 at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> our results also show no evolution in the radio - loud fraction between @xmath5 and @xmath0 ( @xmath6 ) .    </S>",
