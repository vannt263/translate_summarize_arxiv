    "the position of the melting line in the @xmath1 plane is mainly influenced by the anisotropy of the superconductor @xcite .",
    "in ybco with its low anisotropy , most of the melting line @xmath10 lies in the vicinity of the upper critical field @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the induction field in the relevant regime .",
    "the phase diagram for superconductors with a melting line in this regime was discussed by us in ref .",
    "this magnetic field regime consists of a vortex lattice , or vortex fluid , with overlapping vortex cores , if we use elastic constants calculated in refs . .",
    "the phase diagram was derived on the basis of a defect melting model set up in refs .",
    "the model is gaussian in the elastic strains and takes into account the defect degrees of freedom by integer - valued gauge fields . from this",

    "we have shown in ref . by using hyperscaling relations that the higher - order character ( more than second - order ) of this line is in accordance with experiments and numerics which determines the scaling of the disorder phase correlation length @xcite .",

    "the @xmath13-line does not correspond to the irreversibility line where magnetization sweeps show hysteresis .",
    "the position of this line in the case of bscco is mostly influenced by surface barriers @xcite in contrast to ybco where the pinning mechanism is responsible for the irreversibility .",
    "this leads to a coincidence of the irreversibility line with the glass transition line between the vortex - glass and vortex - liquid @xcite .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite via josephson plasma experiments that the @xmath6-line is not accompanied by a josephson decoupling between the layers ruling out the possibility of a transition from vortex lines to weakly coupled pancake vortices . that such a transition exist was proposed theoretically in refs .   .",
    "so far we point out , that it is not experimentally clear yet what kind of phase vg1 is @xcite .",
    "there are , for example , hints that this phase could be a disordered flux line liquid @xcite .",
    "this is suggested by muon spin rotation experiments which , however are in contradiction to other experiments which reported bragg - peaks in this phase @xcite . in the interpretation of vg1 as a disordered flux line liquid ,",
    "vg2 consists of a quasi - two dimensional vortex solid .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to investigate the above phase transitions in the defect melting model mentioned earlier @xcite used in ref .   to calculate the phase diagram of ybco .",
    "we will first review briefly the model .",
    "a more comprehensive discussion can be found in our former papers and the book @xcite .",
    "in contrast to ybco , bscco is a strongly layered material where the coupling between the layers is described by the josephson coupling in the hamiltonian of the system . for high magnetic fields beyond the first - order line ,",
    "one obtains a suppression of the josephson coupling between the layers @xcite with respect to the electromagnetic coupling . in our elastic model with defects",
    ", we can not get this decoupling .",
    "we shall accommodate it effectively via an appropriate modification of the elastic moduli of the vortex lattice system in this region of the magnetic field . with the help of the elastic moduli of brandt @xcite for bscco",
    "we show that one expects two thermal decouplings for the vortex strings in the liquid phase , corresponding to the two glass transition lines in fig .  1 , in contrast to the single line in ybco @xcite .",
    "on this way , we carry out the mzard - parisi analysis for the hamiltonian of the vortex lattice system with pinning .",
    "it consists of a variational approach to fit the free energy of the replicated system with the free energy of a quadratic hamiltonian .",
    "we obtain an almost vertical third - order depinning glass transition line in the liquid high - temperature phase located in the vicinity of the @xmath6 line in fig .  1 separating a full replica symmetric saddle point solution at high temperatures and a full replica symmetry broken solution at lower temperatures .",
    "we show that the saddle point equation to the variational free energy has no solution for very low temperatures .",
    "this is also the case when going beyond the mzard - parisi theory within variational perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "this is a systematic extension of the mzard - parisi theory to higher orders .",
    "it is well - known phenomenon of higher - order variational perturbation expansion of the quantum mechanical anharmonic oscillator , that variations of the trial free energy do not necessarily have to show a minimum or a maximum @xcite , where the odd orders of variational perturbation theory possess a minimum , but even orders have no saddle points but only turning points .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite for the anharmonic oscillator that also turning points are acceptable .",
    "this is the principle of minimal sensitivity . motivated by good results for the anharmonic oscillator we generalize the variational approach of mzard - parisi by using the principle of minimal sensitivity for the calculation of the variational free energy . with the help of this extension",
    "we shall obtain a variational free energy in the whole interesting regime of the @xmath1 phase diagram for the vortex lattice .",
    "this phase diagram looks rather similar to the phase diagram in fig .  1 .",
    "the glass transition line @xmath5 corresponds then within our model to the temperature where saddle point solutions to the variational free energy stops to exist and the best solution corresponds to turning points at lower temperatures where these turning point solutions are still full replica symmetry broken .",
    "the transition show second - order characteristic and can be interpreted as a thermal depinning transition where an almost equally displaced substring due to disorder forming a plateau decouples from the impurities due to temperature fluctuations .",
    "finally , we point out here as was also the assumption for ybco @xcite that we will only consider the phase diagram in the @xmath1 regime in the vicinity of the melting line . going beyond this restriction would take much more effort being out of the scope of this work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii and section iii we state the model and the mzard - parisi approach to the free energy of the vortex lattice system for bscco . in section",
    "iv we discuss solutions of the saddle point equation within the mzard - parisi approach . in section v we consider the regimes where this equation is not solvable .",
    "section vi goes beyond lowest order variational perturbation theory using generalized principle of minimal sensitivity .",
    "section vii discusses observable consequences of our theory . in the appendices a and b we supply additional material to sections v and vi",
