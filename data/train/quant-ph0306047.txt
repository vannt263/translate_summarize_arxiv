    "an important physical quantity of the theory of non - equilibrium processes is the entropy production , that is the rate at which entropy is produced as a result of irreversible processes @xcite . in the classical theory",
    "the entropy production provides an important lyapunov functional of non - equilibrium stationary states and leads to the principle of minimal entropy production .",
    "it further enables the determination of non - equilibrium transport properties and onsager coefficients ( for a recent discussion of the classical theory see , e.  g.  @xcite ) .    in the quantum theory of open systems @xcite the entropy production is usually related to the negative derivative of the relative entropy with respect to an invariant state . on the ground of the weak coupling master equation for the open system s density matrix the corresponding expressions can again be shown to have useful convexity properties and to satisfy a minimal entropy production principle @xcite , as well as a kind of quantum onsager relations @xcite .",
    "the concept of relative entropy is also useful in quantum information theory @xcite , e.  g. in the quantification of entanglement @xcite and of the success of quantum teleportation @xcite .",
    "a general account of the theory of quantum entropy may be found in @xcite .    during the past decade",
    "there has been considerable interest in the application of stochastic wave function methods to the analysis and simulation of dissipative open quantum systems .",
    "by contrast to the conventional description in terms of the reduced density matrix , in these methods one considers an ensemble of pure states whose time - evolution is governed by a stochastic process in the underlying hilbert space @xmath1 of the open system . in a particularly interesting method of this kind , developed by several authors @xcite",
    ", the wave function represents a piecewise deterministic process in hilbert space .",
    "this means that the stochastic evolution consists of smooth , deterministic parts which are interrupted by instantaneous quantum jumps .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the stochastic wave function method can be generalized to enable the treatment of non - markovian quantum processes @xcite and of bosonic @xcite and of fermionic @xcite many - body systems by means of an appropriate stochastic representation in the doubled hilbert space @xmath2 .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to connect the stochastic state vector dynamics to the production of quantum entropy . to this end",
    ", we apply the entropy balance equation of non - equilibrium thermodynamics to the von neumann entropy of the open system .",
    "a quantum jump of the stochastic dynamics is linked to the exchange of an entropy quantum between system and environment .",
    "this enables one to express the entropy flux in terms of the random processes which count the numbers of quantum jumps belonging to the various decay modes of the open system . in this way ,",
    "a stochastic representation of the production rate of quantum entropy is derived from the piecewise deterministic state vector evolution .",
    "it will be demonstrated that the obtained expression for the entropy production provides a non - negative and convex functional on the state space of the open system .",
    "furthermore , the stochastic representation is shown to lead to a monte carlo simulation method for the determination of the quantum entropy production in open systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly recall the dynamical description of open quantum systems in terms of quantum master equations and of stochastic differential equations .",
    "iii contains the construction of the stochastic representation of the entropy production rate as well as the proof of its positivity and convexity .",
    "finally , a discussion of the results and examples of monte carlo simulations of the entropy production are given in sec .",
    "we consider an open quantum system with reduced density matrix @xmath3 . the open system is coupled to a heat bath , that is to an external reservoir in a thermal equilibrium state at temperature @xmath4 .",
    "the free evolution of the system is described by some hamiltonian @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , the system may be subjected to an external time - dependent perturbation , e.  g. an external radiation field represented by a hamiltonian @xmath6 . invoking the markov approximation ,",
    "the motion of the reduced system is assumed to be representable in terms of a quantum master equation with a generator @xmath7 in lindblad form @xcite ( choosing units such that @xmath8 ) , @xmath9 + { \\mathcal{d}}(\\rho).\\ ] ] since we allow the perturbation to be explicitly time - dependent the dynamics does not , in general , provide a dynamical semigroup .",

    ". we shall assume in the following that the master equation ( [ lindbladeq ] ) has been derived from an underlying microscopic theory through the weak - coupling approximation .",
    "this implies that the lindblad operators are obtained as eigen - operators of the unperturbed system hamiltonian , @xmath15 = \\pm \\omega_i a_i^{\\pm},\\ ] ] and satisfy @xmath16 .",
    "the relation ( [ commut ] ) also implies that @xmath17 = [ h_0,a_i^-a_i^+ ] = 0.\\ ] ] the damping rates @xmath14 of the decay modes are determined through certain reservoir correlation functions satisfying the kubo - martin - schwinger condition which leads to the relation @xmath18    as mentioned in the introduction the dynamics provided by the master equation ( [ lindbladeq ] ) can be represented in terms of a piecewise deterministic process @xmath19 ( pdp ) in the hilbert space of the open system in the sense that its covariance matrix @xmath20   = \\int d\\psi d\\psi^{\\ast } p[\\psi , t ] |\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi|\\ ] ] satisfies the master equation ( [ lindbladeq ] ) .",
    "here , @xmath21 denotes the expectation value of the stochastic process @xmath19 which is defined in terms of the corresponding time - dependent probability density functional @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "an appropriate stochastic differential equation for the state vector dynamics is given by @xmath23 the first term on the right - hand side provides the deterministic evolution periods of the process @xmath19 .",
    "it corresponds to the deterministic non - linear schrdinger - type equation @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a non - linear operator with a non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath26 given by @xmath27 the quantities @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ pdp - sdgl ] ) are the increments of integer - valued random processes @xmath29 satisfying @xmath30   & = & \\gamma^{\\pm}_i ||a^{\\pm}_i\\psi(t)||^2 dt ,   \\label{poisson - rel-2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 . according to relation ( [ poisson - rel-1 ] ) these increments take on the values @xmath32 or @xmath33 . moreover , if @xmath34 is equal to @xmath33 for a particular pair @xmath35 , all other increments are equal to zero .",
    "thus , in view of the stochastic differential equation ( [ pdp - sdgl ] ) the state vector then undergoes an instantaneous quantum jump of the form @xmath36 the relation ( [ poisson - rel-2 ] ) states that the expectation values of the increments @xmath34 increase linearly with the time increment @xmath37 and are directly proportional to the damping rates @xmath38 and to the square of the norm of @xmath39 . since the latter depends on time through the deterministic motion , the processes @xmath40 are , in general , inhomogeneous in time .",
    "they count the number of quantum jumps of type @xmath35 , i.e.  the number of the jumps ( [ jumps ] ) with lindblad operator @xmath41 .",
    "an appropriate starting point for the definition of the entropy production rate @xmath42 in an open quantum system is provided by the entropy balance equation , @xmath43 here , @xmath44 is the von neumann entropy of the open system ( the boltzmann constant is set equal to @xmath33 ) , @xmath45 the quantity @xmath46 represents the entropy flux , that is the entropy which flows per unit of time from the open system to the reservoir , in which case we have @xmath47 , or from the reservoir to the open system , such that @xmath48 .",
    "thus , according to eq .",
    "( [ balance ] ) the quantity @xmath42 is the rate at which entropy is produced owing to irreversible processes .    in order to define the entropy production rate @xmath42",
    "we therefore need an expression for the entropy flux @xmath46 . to this end",
    ", we recall that the external reservoir causes the wave function to perform instantaneous quantum jumps given by ( [ jumps ] ) .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ commut ] ) the operator @xmath13 induces a transition of the system state in which the energy changes by the amount @xmath49 .",
    "thus , @xmath50 describes upward and @xmath51 downward transitions of the system .",
    "any quantum jump with jump operator @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) corresponds to the absorption ( emission ) of a quantum @xmath52 of energy from ( into ) the reservoir .",
    "because the reservoir is assumed to be in a thermal equilibrium state at temperature @xmath4 , the entropy exchange @xmath53 associated with a quantum jump can be defined by @xmath54 to justify this expression one first observes that within the markov approximation of the reduced system dynamics the reservoir correlation functions decay on a time scale which is - by assumption - short compared to the relaxation time of the open system .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that the energy exchange in a quantum jump with operator @xmath13 appears as a change @xmath55 of the heat energy of the reservoir .",
    "we further note that the reversible character of the energy exchange through a quantum jump derives from the fact that for each jump with operator @xmath51 ( emission ) there also exists the reverse jump with operator @xmath50 ( absorption ) .",
    "thus we see that in each quantum jump with operator @xmath13 an _ entropy quantum _",
    "( [ enquant ] ) is absorbed from or emitted into the reservoir .",
    "the integer - valued process @xmath56 represents the number of quantum jumps with operator @xmath13 within the time interval @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "it follows that in the time interval @xmath57 $ ] , on the average , the net amount @xmath58\\ ] ] of entropy flows into the reservoir .",
    "consequently , the mean entropy flux is obtained from the expression @xmath59.\\ ] ] this relation finally leads to the following stochastic expression of the entropy production rate of the open system , @xmath60.\\ ] ] by use of this expression the entropy production rate @xmath61 can easily be determined by a monte carlo simulation of the stochastic process ( [ pdp - sdgl ] ) . to this end , one evaluates the von neumann entropy by means of eq .",
    "( [ rhodef ] ) and records the numbers @xmath56 of the various quantum jumps carried out during the time interval @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "we note the following important properties of the entropy production rate @xmath42 defined by expression ( [ sigma ] ) .",
    "first , it is immediately clear that @xmath42 is an extensive quantity : when combining statistically independent systems which are coupled to the same reservoir , the additivity of the von neumann entropy and the additivity of the numbers of quantum jumps is obvious .",
    "second , eq .  ( [ sigma ] ) implies that @xmath42 does not depend on the specific representation of the state space of the reduced system , since neither the von neumann entropy nor the number of quantum jumps of a given type changes under unitary transformations . in particular , the expression ( [ sigma ] )",
    "is invariant under a transformation to the interaction picture with respect to the system hamiltonian @xmath5 .",
    "third , the entropy production @xmath42 as defined in this way is always non - negative , @xmath62 which corresponds to the second law of thermodynamics .    to prove the inequality ( [ second - law ] ) we first write the entropy production rate as a functional @xmath63 $ ] of the reduced density matrix @xmath64 . invoking the master equation ( [ lindbladeq ] )",
    "one finds the time - derivative of the von neumann entropy , @xmath65 to obtain an appropriate expression for the entropy flux we use eqs .",
    "( [ enflux ] ) and ( [ poisson - rel-2 ] ) , as well as the representation ( [ rhodef ] ) of the density matrix to get @xmath66 on the other hand , employing definition ( [ diss ] ) of the dissipator and the commutation relations ( [ commut ] ) and ( [ commut2 ] ) one finds @xmath67 \\rho + \\frac{1}{2}[a_i^+a_i^-,h_0]\\rho \\right\\ }   \\nonumber \\\\ *   & ~ & + \\sum_i \\gamma_i^+ { \\mathrm{tr } } \\left\\ {   a_i^- [ h_0,a_i^+ ] \\rho + \\frac{1}{2}[a_i^-a_i^+,h_0]\\rho \\right\\ }   \\nonumber \\\\ *   & = & -\\sum_i \\omega_i { \\mathrm{tr } } \\left\\ {   \\gamma_i^- a_i^+a_i^-\\rho - \\gamma_i^+ a_i^-a_i^+\\rho \\right\\ }   \\nonumber \\\\ *   & = & -tj.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the commutation relations ( [ commut ] ) also imply that the gibbs state @xmath68 with partition function @xmath69 represents a zero - mode of the dissipator of the master equation , that is @xmath70 physically , this means that the gibbs state is a stationary solution of the master equation without perturbation ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "we express the hamiltonian @xmath5 in terms of the gibbs state , @xmath72 which , together with eq .",
    "( [ enflux-3 ] ) , enables us to write the entropy flux as follows , @xmath73 combining this with eq .",
    "( [ dots ] ) we are finally led to the following expression for the entropy production rate in the state @xmath64 , @xmath74 = -{\\mathrm{tr } } \\left\\ { { \\mathcal{d}}(\\rho )   \\left ( \\ln \\rho - \\ln \\rho_{\\mathrm{th } } \\right ) \\right\\}.\\ ] ]    the inequality ( [ second - law ] ) can now be shown in two alternative ways .",
    "one way is to apply a theorem by lindblad @xcite to the dynamical semigroup @xmath75 whose generator is identical to the dissipator @xmath11 of the master equation , and to relate the functional ( [ sig - functional ] ) to the time - derivative of the relative entropy with respect to the gibbs state @xmath76 . another possibility is to use lieb s theorem @xcite to conclude that the map @xmath77 is a convex functional .",
    "since @xmath78 is linear in @xmath64 , it follows that the entropy production rate @xmath63 $ ] represents a convex functional of the density matrix . with the help of this property it is easy to demonstrate that the entropy production is non - negative @xcite .",

    "it has been shown in the preceding section that the piecewise deterministic process ( [ pdp - sdgl ] ) for the stochastic state vector of an open quantum system yields a natural definition of the entropy production as a measure of the degree of the irreversibility of the dynamics . in this definition",
    "the entropy flux has been expressed in terms of the random numbers of the various types of quantum jumps corresponding to the decay channels of the open system .",
    "the given proof of the positivity of the entropy production rate demonstrates not only that the entropy production @xmath42 is non - negative ( see eq .",
    "( [ second - law ] ) ) but also that it is a convex functional and that @xmath86 is an absolute minimum of the entropy production ( see eq .",
    "( [ sig - functional ] ) ) .",
    "hence , in the absence of external fields ( @xmath71 ) the entropy production vanishes when the equilibrium state is reached , in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "we remark that for vanishing external fields @xmath42 coincides with the negative time derivative of the relative entropy with respect to the gibbs state @xmath76 .",
    "this is no longer true when external fields are present .",
    "contrary to the definition of entropy production in terms of the relative entropy , the above definition does not assume the existence of a stationary density matrix .",
    "in the case of a non - vanishing external field ( @xmath87 ) one expects , in general , that the systems stays away from equilibrium and that , therefore , entropy is continuously produced .",
    "an important physical situation arises ( see the examples below ) if there exists a stationary solution @xmath88 of the master equation in the interaction picture . since the expression for the entropy production is not affected by the transformation to the interaction picture one finds that the entropy production in the stationary state is given by the constant value @xmath89,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 denotes the expectation value in the stationary state .",
    "in such a stationary non - equilibrium state entropy is thus produced at a constant rate @xmath90 .",
    "what happens physically is that the energy supplied to the system by the external field is ultimately transferred as heat energy to the reservoir leading to a constant entropy production rate .",
    "it is well - known that the stochastic representation of the master equation ( [ lindbladeq ] ) through a stochastic process of the form ( [ pdp - sdgl ] ) is not unique : in general , one can choose , in an infinite number of different ways , the lindblad jump operators and the hamiltonian operator without changing the form of the lindblad generator @xmath7 of the master equation ( [ lindbladeq ] ) . however , different such choices do change , in general , the stochastic dynamics ( [ pdp - sdgl ] ) .",
    "this fact is well understood in the framework of continuous measurement theory according to which different choices for the jump operators correspond to different measurement schemes used to monitor the open system @xcite .",
    "our construction of expression ( [ sigma ] ) for the entropy production rate presupposes , however , that the jump operators @xmath13 are eigen - operators of the system hamiltonian , satisfying the commutation relation ( [ commut ] ) .",
    "it is this property which enables one to establish the connection between the stochastic expression ( [ sigma ] ) and the functional ( [ sig - functional ] ) .",
    "physically , it is the eigen - operator property which allows one to associate a certain quantum jump of type @xmath35 with the exchange of a quantum @xmath52 of energy with the thermal reservoir .    in the case of a non - degenerate frequency spectrum @xmath91 the requirement provided by the commutation relations ( [ commut ] )",
    "uniquely fixes the jump operators and , thus , the stochastic state vector dynamics .",
    "if a certain frequency @xmath52 is degenerate one has the freedom to replace the corresponding jump operators @xmath92 ( the index @xmath93 labels different lindblad operators belonging to the same frequency @xmath52 ) by new operators @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a unitary matrix .",
    "however , in view of eq .",
    "( [ enflux-2 ] ) it is immediately clear that expression ( [ sigma ] ) remains invariant under this replacement , showing the uniqueness of the stochastic expression of the entropy production rate .",
    "we conclude the paper by two examples which illustrate several of the features discussed above .",
