    "the study of finite group actions on topological spaces has a long and distinguished history .",
    "a frequent theme is to try and understand the topology of the fixed point set , both in it s intrinsic form , and as a subspace of the original space .",
    "the classic work of smith shows that for finite @xmath1-groups acting on spheres , the fixed point set has the @xmath5 cohomology of a sphere . however , there are examples of ` exotic ' actions on spheres , where the fixed point set is not _",
    "homeomorphic _ to a sphere ( indeed , does not even have the @xmath3 cohomology of a sphere ) . in this short paper , we are interested in relating actions on a hyperbolic group with the induced action on its boundary at infinity",
    ".    we will start by relating the fixed subgroup of an automorphism with the fixed subset of the induced action on the boundary at infinity .",
    "in particular , this will allow us to use the classic theorem of smith to prove that if one starts with a @xmath2-hyperbolic poincar duality group over @xmath3 , and the group that is acting is a finite @xmath1-group ( @xmath1 a prime ) , then the fixed subgroup is a poincar duality group over @xmath4 .",
    "we will then use the strict hyperbolization technique due to charney and davis [ 6 ] to construct examples of involutions of a poincar duality group over @xmath3 whose fixed subgroup fails to be a poincar duality group over @xmath3 ( and in fact , are nt even duality groups over @xmath3 ) .",
    "these examples also provide examples of ` exotic ' involution on a sphere ( the boundary at infinity ) which can be realized geometrically ( i.e. by an isometry of a @xmath6 space ) .",
    "they also show that , in general , one could have involutions of @xmath6 spaces having a sphere as the boundary at infinity , where the induced involution on the boundary has a fixed point set which is _ not _ an anr .",
    "* remark : * this paper was motivated by the following more specific questions ( each of which is still open ) .",

    "* question 1 * : is the fixed subgroup @xmath11 a poincar duality group over @xmath3 ?    * question 2 * : is @xmath12 induced by an involution of @xmath8 ? that is to say , does there exist a self - homeomorphism @xmath13 with @xmath14 , and @xmath15 ?",
    "* question 3 * : let @xmath16 be the induced involution of the sphere at infinity of the universal cover of @xmath8 .",

    "the authors would like to thank the referee for several helpful comments , in particular for pointing out the existence of [ 5 ] and [ 8 ] , and for suggesting the extension of theorem 2.2 that is included at the end of section 2 .",
    "we would also like to thank the members of the geometric and function theory seminar at the university of michigan for pointing out a substantial simplification in our original proof of proposition 2.1 .",
    "[ fixedsgpsbdry ] let @xmath18 be a @xmath2-hyperbolic group , @xmath19 an automorphism of @xmath18 of finite order @xmath20 , and @xmath21 the induced action of @xmath19 on @xmath22 .",
    "then @xmath23 is homeomorphic to @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath25 be a symmetric generating set for @xmath18 , and consider the action of @xmath26 on @xmath18 .",
    "observe that if we define a new generating set @xmath27 , then @xmath19 acts by isometries on the cayley graph @xmath28 of @xmath18 with respect to these generators .",
    "indeed , we note that given any pair of elements @xmath29 in @xmath18 , we have that :    @xmath30    taking a minimal such expression , and applying @xmath19 to it , we see that :    @xmath31    but by invariance of @xmath32 under @xmath19 , we immediately get an expression for @xmath33 as a product of @xmath34 elements of @xmath35 .",
    "this forces @xmath36 .",
    "but now @xmath19 , by hypothesis , has finite order @xmath20 .",
    "so by iterating our inequality we get that :    @xmath37    which implies that all the inequalities are in fact equalities , and hence that @xmath19 does indeed act by isometries on @xmath28 . from now on , we will omit the subscript @xmath32 from our distance function in order to simplify notation .",
    "our next step is to define certain subsets of the cayley graph @xmath28 in terms of their behavior under @xmath19 , and to control the distance between these subsets .",
    "we let @xmath38 , and observe that @xmath39 .",
    "neumann [ 15 ] has shown that , for each i , there exists a @xmath40 such that @xmath41 .",
    "next we observe that , by neumann [ 15 ] , the subgroup @xmath42 is quasi - convex in @xmath18 . in particular , @xmath43 embeds in @xmath22 . now note that , trivially , we have that @xmath44 is in fact a subset of @xmath23 . to prove equality , we need to show the reverse inclusion .",
    "so let us take a point @xmath45 , and let @xmath46 be a geodesic ray based at the identity and with @xmath47 .",
    "now by our choice of generators , we know that @xmath48 will also be a geodesic ray ( since @xmath19 acts isometrically on the cayley graph ) , and since the point @xmath49 is fixed by @xmath50 , we must have @xmath51 for some constant @xmath52 .",
    "our next claim is that , for each @xmath53 , the inequality @xmath54 holds ( and hence , as @xmath55 , forces @xmath56 ) . in order to see this",
    ", we consider the following construction : given an integer @xmath53 , we define @xmath57 to be an integer satisfying @xmath58 ( note that both @xmath59 and @xmath60 correspond to elements in @xmath18 ) .",
    "we claim that @xmath61 for all @xmath53 . by way of contradiction , assume that @xmath62 .",
    "the triangle inequality gives us : @xmath63 a contradiction ( recall that @xmath64 are both the identity element in @xmath18 ) .",
    "the case @xmath65 can be dealt with in an analogous manner .",
    "we now know that , if @xmath66 is an arbitrary geodesic ray originating at the identity , and having @xmath67 , then @xmath68 .",
    "however , we also have that @xmath69 for some constant @xmath70 .",
    "in particular , we can find a geodesic ray in @xmath71 which has uniformly bounded distance from @xmath66 , which forces @xmath72 , completing the proof of the proposition .",
    "we say that a topological space @xmath73 is an @xmath53-dimensional cech cohomology sphere with @xmath74 coefficients ( where @xmath74 is a pid ) provided that @xmath75 for all @xmath76 , and @xmath77 ( @xmath78 refers to reduced cech cohomology ) .",
    "we say that a torsion - free group @xmath0 is a _ duality group of dimension @xmath53 over @xmath74 _ ( where again , @xmath74 is a pid ) , provided that there is a right @xmath79-module @xmath52 such that one has natural isomorphisms @xmath80 for all @xmath81 and all @xmath79-modules @xmath82 ( naturality is taken with respect to @xmath82 , and @xmath0 acts diagonally on the tensor product @xmath83 ) .",
    "if in addition we have that @xmath84 , then we say that @xmath0 is a _ poincar duality group of dimension @xmath53 over @xmath74_. finally , if @xmath0 is a poincar duality group of dimension @xmath53 over @xmath74 , and the @xmath0 action on @xmath85 is trivial , we say that @xmath0 is an _ orientable poincar duality group of dimension @xmath53 over @xmath74_.    for background material on duality groups and poincar duality groups , we refer to the lecture notes by bieri [ 2 ] .",
    "next , we quote the following result from bestvina and mess ( corollary 1.3 in their paper [ 1 ] ) :    [ begm ] let @xmath18 be a torsion - free @xmath2-hyperbolic group .",
    "then @xmath18 is a poincar duality group of dimension @xmath53 over @xmath86 if and only if @xmath87 is an @xmath88-dimensional cech cohomology sphere with @xmath86 coefficients .    using their result",
    ", we obtain an immediate corollary to our previous proposition :    [ pdgrpsbdry ] let @xmath18 be a torsion - free @xmath2-hyperbolic poincar duality group of dimension @xmath53 over @xmath5 . let @xmath0 be a finite @xmath1-group ( @xmath1 prime ) acting by automorphisms on @xmath18 .",
    "then there is a @xmath89 such that the subgroup @xmath90 is a poincar duality group of dimension @xmath91 over @xmath5 .",
    "let us first consider the case where @xmath0 is @xmath4 .",
    "then consider the induced action of @xmath0 on the boundary at infinity @xmath22 .",
    "notice that , by bestvina and mess result , @xmath92 is a compact @xmath88-dimensional cech cohomology sphere with @xmath5 coefficients .",
    "so we can use a version of smith theory ( see theorem iii.7.11 in bredon [ 4 ] ) , to get that the fixed point set of the action on the boundary at infinity must be a @xmath93-dimensional cech cohomology sphere with @xmath94 coefficients ( for some @xmath95 ) .",
    "now our proposition [ fixedsgpsbdry ] along with bestvina and mess result immediately implies that the group @xmath90 is a poincar duality group of dimension @xmath91 over @xmath5 ( where @xmath96 ) .",
    "for the more general case , we note that , since every @xmath1-group is solvable , one can find a normal subgroup @xmath97 .",
    "finally one uses induction , since we have that @xmath98 .",
    "this gives the general case .",
    "as was pointed out to the authors by the referee , corollary 2.1 also follows from the result announced by chang and skjelbred in [ 5 ] , where they explain why the fixed set of a finite @xmath1-group action on a poincar duality space over @xmath4 is still a poincar duality space over @xmath4 .",
    "we conclude this section by mentioning that a poincar duality group over @xmath3 is automatically a poincar duality group over @xmath4 , but that the converse does not necessarily hold . in theorem 2.2",
    ", the group @xmath99 will be an example of this with @xmath100 .",
    "one can now ask the question of whether the previous result can be strengthened to obtain that the fixed subgroup is a poincar duality group over @xmath101 .",
    "this turns out to be false , and in this section , we will construct counterexamples . as was pointed out by the referee , similar examples were constructed by davis & leary [ 8 ] .",
    "their construction used the reflection trick method ( as opposed to our use of hyperbolization ) and served a somewhat different purpose .",
    "we now proceed to state our main theorem .",
    "let @xmath102 be a pl involution of a sphere @xmath103 whose fixed point set is a submanifold @xmath104 which is _ not _ a homology sphere ( with @xmath3 coefficients ) , and has dimension @xmath105 .",
    "let @xmath73 be the strict hyperbolization of the suspension of @xmath103 , and @xmath106 the induced involution on @xmath73 .",
    "let @xmath18 be the fundamental group of @xmath73 , and @xmath19 the induced involution on @xmath18 .",
    "then @xmath19 is an involution of a ( @xmath2-hyperbolic ) orientable poincar duality group over @xmath101 whose fixed subgroup @xmath99 is not a duality group over @xmath101 .    before starting with the proof ,",
    "let us note that examples of involutions of spheres whose fixed point sets are not homology spheres do exist .",
    "in fact , jones [ 11 ] has proved that every closed pl manifold that has the @xmath107 homology of a sphere can be realized as the fixed point set of a pl involution of some larger dimensional sphere .    for a more concrete example",
    ", we can consider brieskorn spheres : for @xmath108 , define two complex functions @xmath109 , and @xmath110 .",
    "using these two functions , define a pair of manifolds @xmath111 and @xmath112 by considering the intersection of @xmath113 and @xmath114 with a small enough ball centered at the origin in the appropriate complex vector space .",
    "it is known that @xmath111 is pl homeomorphic to the sphere @xmath115 , while @xmath112 is a @xmath116-dimensional manifold that does not have the @xmath101-homology of a sphere ( combine lemma 8.1 with the comments on pg .",
    "72 in milnor [ 14 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , observe that the involution @xmath117 on @xmath111 has fixed point set @xmath112 , giving us an infinite family of examples .",
    "we start by recalling that the strict hyperbolization procedure given by charney and davis ( section 7 in [ 6 ] ) takes a simplicial complex and functorially assigns to it a topological space ( in fact , a union of compact hyperbolic manifolds with corners ) that supports a metric of strict negative curvature .",
    "let us apply this procedure to the suspension of the sphere @xmath118 ( respectively @xmath119 ) , and call the resulting space @xmath120 ( respectively @xmath121 ) .",
    "we will omit the dimension of the spaces unless we explicitly require them for computations .",
    "we now list out some properties of the spaces @xmath73 and @xmath122 .",
    "observe that , by a result of illman [ 9 ] , there exists a triangulation of the pair @xmath123 such that the involution @xmath102 is a simplicial map .",
    "in particular , the involution on the suspension will still be simplicial , and @xmath119 is a subcomplex of @xmath118 .",
    "functoriality of the strict hyperbolization procedure now implies that @xmath122 is a totally geodesic subspace of @xmath73 , invariant under the induced involution @xmath106 on @xmath73 .",
    "since hyperbolization preserves the local structure , @xmath73 will be an orientable manifold , while @xmath122 will have a pair of non - manifold points ( corresponding to the two vertices of the suspension ) .",
    "now take a basepoint @xmath124 , and let @xmath125 , @xmath126 .",
    "the involution @xmath106 will give an order two automorphism @xmath19 of the group @xmath18 .",
    "we note that , since @xmath18 is the fundamental group of a closed orientable aspherical manifold , it is automatically an orientable poincar duality group over @xmath101 .",
    "now consider the fixed subgroup @xmath99 . in order to get information about this group",
    ", we consider a lift of the action to the universal cover @xmath127 of @xmath73 .",
    "let @xmath128 be a preimage of the point @xmath129 , and let us lift the involution @xmath106 to the universal cover .",
    "note that the fixed point set of the lifted involution is precisely the path connected lift @xmath130 of @xmath122 that contains the point @xmath131 .",
    "furthermore , the action @xmath19 on @xmath18 is compatible with the lift @xmath132 of @xmath106 , in the sense that @xmath133 .",
    "next we note that @xmath134 .",
    "indeed @xmath86 is automatically fixed by @xmath19 , hence we have a containment @xmath135 . on the other hand , for an arbitrary @xmath136 , we have that @xmath137 .",
    "in particular , @xmath138 must be fixed under @xmath132 , which implies @xmath139 .",
    "since @xmath130 is a path connected , totally geodesic subset , we can connect @xmath131 to @xmath138 by a path which lies entirely within @xmath130 .",
    "looking at the projection of this path in @xmath73 , we observe that it is a closed loop based at @xmath129 , representing the element @xmath140 , and lying entirely in @xmath122 .",
    "hence @xmath141 , giving us the reverse containment .",
    "we conclude that the two groups are equal .",
    "[ graph ]        so in particular , @xmath122 is a topological space which happens to be a @xmath142 . in particular ,",
    "the group cohomology of @xmath99 is related to the compactly supported cohomology of @xmath130 .",
    "so we have now reduced our claim to analyzing the properties of @xmath143 . in order to do this",
    ", we consider the zeeman spectral sequence ; let us first introduce some terminology .",
    "we will denote by @xmath144 the @xmath145 local homology sheaf for @xmath122 , and by @xmath146 the corresponding sheaf for @xmath130 .",
    "for @xmath147 ( respectively , in @xmath148 ) , we will denote by @xmath149 ( respectively @xmath150 ) the stalk at the point @xmath151 . recall that @xmath130 is the hyperbolization of an @xmath152-dimensional complex @xmath153 ; we will use @xmath154 to denote the subspace of @xmath122 obtained from the hyperbolization of the @xmath34-skeleton of @xmath119 . observe the following facts about the local homology sheaf :    * if @xmath155 and @xmath156 , then @xmath157 .",
    "* if @xmath158 , then @xmath159 .",
    "* there exists a point @xmath160 and an integer @xmath161 such that @xmath162 and @xmath163    all of the previous remarks are clear , with the possible exception of the third : let @xmath1 be one of the two vertices of the suspension . since the original link of @xmath1 was _ not _ a homology sphere , and as hyperbolization does not change the link , there must exist an @xmath164 which yields the desired fact .",
    "note that the sheafs we are considering are given by local data , so that we have that @xmath165 , whenever @xmath166 is a lift of the point @xmath151 .",
    "hence we have that the three facts mentioned above for the stalks of the local homology sheaf @xmath144 on @xmath122 also hold for the stalks of the local homology sheaf @xmath146 on @xmath130 .    now the zeeman spectral sequence ( see section 2 of mccrory [ 13 ] , based on previous work of zeeman [ 17 ] )",
    "states that : @xmath167 with differentials @xmath168 .",
    "observe that , by the properties listed above for the @xmath169 local homology sheaf , @xmath170 if @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "so in particular , all the terms vanish except those in the @xmath173 row and those in the @xmath174 column ( see figure on previous page ) .",
    "we now plan on working with this spectral sequence .",
    "observe from the shape of the spectral sequence that one has isomorphisms : @xmath175 @xmath176 and that the differential @xmath177 maps @xmath178 to @xmath179 .",
    "however , we know that @xmath180 , so the differential must be an isomorphism .",
    "this yields : @xmath181 ( since we are dealing with complexes , cech cohomology coincides with standard cohomology ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath130 is simply - connected and has dimension @xmath182 , hence @xmath183 is the trivial @xmath3 sheaf over @xmath184 .",
    "this implies : @xmath185 now focusing on the left hand term , we note that @xmath186 for all @xmath187 , which gives us : @xmath188 but now observe that if @xmath189 is a vertex in @xmath190 which is a lift of @xmath1 ( one of the vertex points of the suspension ) , then @xmath191 for every element @xmath192 . since all the points @xmath193 lie in @xmath190 , and since @xmath99 is an infinite group , this implies that @xmath194 is not finitely generated .",
    "so in particular , @xmath195 is not finitely generated .",
    "since @xmath122 is a finite complex which happens to be a @xmath196 , we conclude that @xmath197 is not finitely generated . by bieri and eckmann s criterion ( see bieri [ 2 ] , section 9.10 ) , this implies that @xmath198 can not be a poincar duality group over @xmath199 .    in order to see that @xmath99 is not even a duality group over @xmath3 , it is sufficient to show that the cohomological dimension of @xmath99 is greater than @xmath200 .",
    "we first note that , since @xmath201 , we have that @xmath202 , so it is sufficient to show that @xmath99 has non - trivial cohomology in some dimension that is strictly greater than @xmath20 .",
    "observe that , by construction , we have that @xmath99 is the fundamental group of the finite aspherical @xmath152-dimensional space @xmath122 , which implies that the cohomological dimension of @xmath99 is at most @xmath203 .",
    "we would be done provided we can show that the cohomological dimension of @xmath99 is exactly @xmath203 . looking back at the construction of @xmath122 , we observe that the submanifold @xmath104 we started with is a @xmath204 homology sphere .",
    "suspending the manifold , we obtain an @xmath152-dimensional space which is a @xmath205 homology manifold .",
    "now @xmath122 is the hyperbolization of this space , and since the hyperbolization procedure preserves the local structure , @xmath122 is also an @xmath152-dimensional @xmath205 homology manifold .",
    "this implies that @xmath206 , which forces the cohomological dimension of @xmath99 to be at least @xmath203 .",
    "this completes our proof .    as was pointed out to the authors by the referee , the argument in theorem 2.2",
    "can also be used to show that the condition that @xmath0 be a p - group in corollary 2.1 really is necessary .",
    "namely , there are examples of a @xmath207 action on an orientable poincar duality @xmath2-hyperbolic group over @xmath3 whose fixed subgroup is not a duality group over _ any _ pid ( in which @xmath208 ) . indeed ,",
    "note that the unit tangent bundle @xmath209 of an @xmath88-dimensional sphere can be identified with the stiefel manifold @xmath210 of orthonormal @xmath211-frames in @xmath212 .",
    "the latter can be embedded in @xmath213 via the map @xmath214 ( where @xmath215 are orthonormal vectors ) .",
    "note that since @xmath216 are orthonormal , we have that @xmath217 , and also that : @xmath218 this implies that @xmath209 is diffeomorphic to the brieskorn variety for the polynomial @xmath219 .",
    "in particular , we see that @xmath209 is the fixed point set of the @xmath207 action on the brieskorn variety for the polynomial @xmath220 , where the action is given by @xmath221 , where @xmath222 .",
    "furthermore , since odd dimensional spheres have a non - zero vector field , we have that @xmath223 .",
    "now let @xmath112 be the fixed point set of the above mentioned action of @xmath207 on the brieskorn variety @xmath111 for the polynomial @xmath224 . as we mentioned earlier ,",
    "the brieskorn variety @xmath111 is pl - homeomorphic to @xmath115 , while by the previous paragraph , @xmath112 is diffeomorphic to @xmath225 . suspending the spaces and",
    "hyperbolizing gives us a @xmath207 action on a @xmath6 space @xmath73 , where now the fixed subset @xmath122 is the hyperbolization of the suspension of @xmath225 .",
    "the proof that @xmath226 is not poincar duality over any pid @xmath74 is almost a verbatim repetition of that given for theorem 2.2 . in particular ,",
    "the local homology sheaf for the space @xmath122 will have three distinct indices ( namely @xmath227 ) for which @xmath228 ( where again , @xmath1 is one of the suspension points ) .",
    "working through the zeeman spectral sequence , we again find indices ( @xmath229 ) where the cohomology of @xmath226 is not finitely generated .",
    "the only substantial change is in the argument showing that the cohomological dimension of @xmath226 over @xmath74 is @xmath230 . to do this",
    ", we merely note that the hyperbolization map @xmath231 induces a surjection on integral homology , together with the fact that @xmath232 .",
    "we finish our paper with a few remarks .",
    "firstly , we note that the results we obtain are , in some sense , dealing with exceptional automorphisms of @xmath2-hyperbolic groups .",
    "indeed , levitt & lustig [ 12 ] have shown that , in a suitable sense , ` most ' automorphisms of a @xmath2-hyperbolic group have very simple fixed point sets for their induced actions on the boundary at infinity ( in fact , their fixed point sets consist of a pair of points ) . also , if we start with a torsion free group , then the group of inner automorphisms will also be torsion free , hence any automorphism of finite order in some sense ` lives ' in the outer automorphism group , which tends to be small .",
    "secondly , we should point out that , in the counterexamples we constructed , the groups @xmath18 all have boundary at infinity which is in fact _ homeomorphic _ to a sphere .",
    "this follows from the fact that the link of every vertex in the space @xmath127 is pl - homeomorphic to the standard sphere , so by a result of davis & januszkiewicz [ 7 ] , the boundary at infinity of @xmath127 is homeomorphic to a sphere .",
    "thirdly , we can ask related questions in a somewhat more general setting .",
    "more precisely , given an arbitrary topological space @xmath122 , we can consider the question of what type of actions can be realized _ algebraically _ or _ geometrically_. by a geometric action , we mean one that is induced by an isometry of a @xmath2-hyperbolic space @xmath73 whose boundary is homeomorphic to @xmath122 . by an algebraic action , we mean one that is induced by an automorphism of a @xmath2-hyperbolic group @xmath18 whose boundary is homeomorphic to @xmath122 .",
    "note that , at the cost of changing the set of generators for the group @xmath18 ( as in the proof of proposition 2.1 ) , we can always view an algebraic action as a geometric one ( given by an isometry of the cayley graph ) .",
    "the fact that this question is non - trivial , even in the more general setting , can be seen by considering the situation of a menger manifold .",
    "it is well known that there are numerous @xmath2-hyperbolic groups whose boundary at infinity are menger manifolds . now",
    "a result of iwamoto [ 10 ] states that every closed subset of a menger manifold can be realized as the fixed point set of an involution . on the other hand ,",
    "if an involution can be realized algebraically via an involution @xmath106 of a group @xmath18 , then the fixed point set on the boundary at infinity must coincide with the boundary at infinity of the subgroup @xmath233 .",
    "however , the latter set can not have any cutpoints ( see bowditch [ 3 ] and swarup [ 1 ] ) .",
    "this gives a necessary condition for a closed subset of a menger manifold to be the fixed point set of an algebraically realizable involution .",
    "what are the sufficient conditions ?    finally , we mention that these examples give involutions of a @xmath2-hyperbolic group @xmath18 where the fixed point set of the induced involution on the boundary at infinity is not an anr , although @xmath234 .",
    "one could ask whether the fixed point set could display other complicated behavior . for instance , does there exist an involution of a @xmath2-hyperbolic group @xmath18 , with fixed subgroup @xmath86 , with the property that @xmath234 , @xmath235 , and the embedding @xmath236 is a locally flat , non - trivial knot ?",
