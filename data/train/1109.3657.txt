    "the classical drude theory of electronic transport provides universal relation between electric and thermal transport coefficients known as the wiedemann - franz law ,  @xcite @xmath0 here @xmath1 and @xmath2 are , respectively , the thermal and electric conductances , @xmath3 is the temperature in energy units @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the electron charge .",
    "the relation represented by eq .   is a natural one since for noninteracting particles both charge and energy are carried by the electronic excitations .",
    "furthermore , as long as elastic collisions govern the transport , the validity of the wiedemann - franz law has been confirmed in the case of arbitrary impurity scattering .",
    "@xcite however , an account of the electron - electron interaction effects within the fermi - liquid theory gives corrections to both @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite these lead to a deviation from the wiedemann - franz law [ eq .  ] , which is associated with the inelastic forward scattering of electrons . in general , violation of the wiedemann - franz law is a hallmark of electron interaction effects and thus is of conceptual interest .    in one - dimensional conductors , such as quantum wires or quantum hall edge states ,",
    "the electron system can no longer be described as a fermi liquid but instead is expected to form a luttinger liquid .  @xcite it has been shown that for the perfect luttinger liquid conductor , such as an impurity - free single - channel quantum wire , interactions inside the wire neither affect conductance quantization  @xcite @xmath6 nor change the thermal conductance of the system  @xcite @xmath7",
    "since both @xmath2 and @xmath1 remain the same as in the case of noninteracting electrons , the wiedemann - franz law holds for an ideal luttinger liquid conductor .",
    "there are two important exceptions known in the literature .",
    "the first one is a luttinger liquid with an impurity studied by kane and fisher .",
    "@xcite in that case electron backscattering takes place which strongly renormalizes both @xmath2 and @xmath1 , such that the wiedemann - franz law is violated .",
    "the second case is the luttinger liquid with long - range inhomogeneities studied by fazio _",
    "et al_.  @xcite if the spatial variations related to these inhomogeneities occur on a length scale much larger than the fermi wavelength , electrons will not suffer any backscattering .",
    "the electric conductance will , therefore , be given by its noninteracting value [ eq .  ] .",
    "at the same time the thermal conductance @xmath1 will be altered by interactions .",
    "the reason for this is as follows . for the system with",
    "broken translational invariance , momentum is not conserved . as a result ,",
    "there are allowed certain pair collisions which conserve the number of right and left movers independently but provide energy exchange between them .",
    "these are precisely the scattering processes that thermalize electrons and thus lead to the violation of the wiedemann - franz law .",
    "recent advances in the fabrication of tunable constrictions in high - mobility two - dimensional electron gases have allowed precise and sensitive thermal measurements in clean one - dimensional systems .",
    "these include experiments on the thermal transport of single - channel quantum wires , where a lower value of the thermal conductance than that predicted by the wiedemann - franz law was observed at the plateau of the electrical conductance .",
    "@xcite another set of experiments reported enhanced thermopower in low - density quantum wires  @xcite and quantum hall edges .",
    "@xcite remarkable experiments based on momentum - resolved tunneling spectroscopy provided direct evidence for the electronic thermalization in one - dimensional systems .",
    "@xcite clearly interaction effects are responsible for the observed features ; however , luttinger liquid theory does not provide an adequate description for these observations .",
    "ongoing theoretical efforts in the study of one - dimensional electron systems focus on nonequilibrium dynamics  @xcite and consequences of the nonlinear dispersion in transport  @xcite that lie beyond the scope of conventional luttinger liquid paradigm .",
    "the kinetics of one - dimensional electrons with nonlinear dispersion is peculiar .",
    "indeed , constraints imposed by the momentum and energy conservation allow either zero - momentum transfer or exchange of momenta for pair collisions .",
    "neither process changes the electronic distribution function , and as a result they have no effect on transport coefficients and relaxation .",
    "therefore , three - particle collisions play a central role .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we study the fate of the wiedemann - franz law and the origin of the electron energy relaxation in clean single - channel quantum wires , accounting for the scattering processes that involve three - particle collisions .",
