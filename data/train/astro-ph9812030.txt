    "dwarf spheroidal galaxies are probably the most common type of galaxy in the universe .",
    "because of their ubiquity , and because the accretion of dwarf galaxies may have played an important role in the formation / evolution of large galaxies , an understanding of dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies is key to many problems in astronomy . the great majority of our knowledge of dwarf spheroidal galaxies results from the galaxy s nine dsph companions . in order to broaden this knowledge and to investigate the effects of environment on the formation and evolution of dwarf galaxies , it is important to study dsph galaxies beyond the milky way s companions . some mechanisms by which environment can influence the evolution of dwarf galaxies include : tidal interactions , removal of a dwarf s interstellar medium via ram pressure sweeping , confinement of a dwarf s interstellar medium via ambient pressure , and photoionization of the interstellar medium by a nearby source of uv radiation ( such as a quasar or agn ) .    detailed study of dwarf spheroidals beyond the milky way will help reveal how much we can generalize from the nine galactic companions .",
    "for example , the galactic dwarf spheroidals follow reasonably tight relations between central surface brightness and absolute magnitude and between absolute magnitude and mean metal abundance ( e.g. , caldwell et al .  1992 ) .",
    "are these relations universal or do they change with environment ? the present , limited data have not revealed changes with environment ( caldwell et al .",
    "1998 ) . as another example , the galactic dwarf spheroidals show an amazing diversity in their star formation histories , ranging from a single star - formation episode of globular cluster age to ongoing star formation that peaked @xmath03 gyr ago ( e.g. , da costa 1998 ) . is this diversity universal or did special circumstances contribute to the varied star formation histories of the milky way s dwarf spheroidals ?",
    "another puzzle is the ( imperfect ) correlation among the galactic dwarfs between the duration of star formation and distance from the galactic center , with the outer dwarfs continuing to form stars over longer periods than the inner dwarfs ( van den bergh 1994 ) .",
    "again , it would be valuable to understand whether this trend is seen in other systems .",
    "finally , what is the behavior of the galaxy luminosity function at the faint end and is this dependent on environment ?",
    "there is some indication that rich clusters of galaxies have a steeper slope for the faint end of the luminosity function than the local group , though this could be caused by incompleteness in the local group ( trentham 1998 ) .",
    "the nearest collection of dwarf spheroidals beyond the milky way s halo is m31 s companions . van den bergh s ( 1972 , 1974 ) survey of 700 square degrees around m31 with the palomar 48-inch schmidt and iiiaj plates revealed three dwarf spheroidal companions ( and i , ii & iii ) .",
    "surface brightness profiles and structural parameters have been measured for these dsphs by caldwell et al .",
    "magnitude diagrams from 4m - class ground - based telescopes are also available for all three galaxies ( mould & kristian 1990 ; konig et al .",
    "1993 ; armandroff et al .",
    "these show the brightest @xmath02 magnitudes of the red giant branch and yield line - of - sight distances similar to that of m31 .",
    "all these data indicate a considerable degree of similarity between these three m31 dwarf spheroidals and those of the galaxy .",
    "the most significant developments that have occurred since the last review article devoted exclusively to the m31 dwarf spheroidals ( armandroff 1994 ) are : 1 ) color  magnitude diagrams from hst / wfpc2 that reach below the horizontal branch for and i & ii ; 2 ) searches for additional dwarf spheroidals that have revealed three new m31 companions .",
    "consequently , this review will focus on these two areas of recent progress .",
    "although ground - based images of the m31 dsph companions can provide a large amount of useful information , such data are limited by image crowding to the brightest 2 or 3 magnitudes of the red giant branch . on the other hand , because of the hubble space telescope s superior resolution , images obtained with the wfpc2 camera aboard hst can yield accurate photometry for stars at the level of the horizontal branch , or fainter , in these galaxies . in this section",
    "we outline some of the results obtained in our team s ( other co - i s are n.  caldwell and p.  seitzer ) program to image the m31 dsph companions with wfpc2 . the results for and  i have been published in da  costa et al .",
    "( 1996 ) while those for and  ii are presented here for the first time .",
    "our observations of and  iii are scheduled to be executed in early 1999 .",
    "our program uses the @xmath1 ( wide@xmath2 ) and @xmath3 ( wide@xmath4 ) filters ; the @xmath3 filter being preferred to the more common @xmath5 ( @xmath0@xmath6 ) because it allows greater sensitivity to faint _ blue _ horizontal branch stars . for each dsph",
    "our procedure is to take a first series of deep exposures and then , a few ( @xmath75 ) days later , take a second series of exposures at the same orientation but with the field center displaced by @xmath020 pc pixels .",
    "this displacement of the field center allows us to readily separate faint stars from the instrumental effects present in wfpc2 images , while the lag between the observation sets allows us to detect variable stars , particularly rr  lyrae variables .",
    "the total exposure times for each dsph are of order 2.3 hrs with the @xmath1 filter and 5.4 hrs with @xmath3 .    even when centered on the centers of these dsph galaxies , the wfpc2 frames are sufficiently uncrowded ( cf .  fig .",
    "1 of da  costa et al .",
    "1996 ) that aperture photometry techniques can be successfully employed .",
    "we then use the zeropoints and transformation equations listed in holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) to convert the wfpc2 photometry to the standard @xmath2 , @xmath8 system , though we have a ground - based program underway to confirm the zeropoints of these data .",
    "the final color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for and  i derived from our wfpc2 images is shown in fig .  1 , which is taken from da  costa et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "= 8.5 cm    from the data presented in fig .  1 , and from the similar cmd for and  ii",
    ", we can draw a number of inferences .",
    "we will consider these in the following order : results that derive primarily from the morphology of the cmds ; results , such as dsph line - of - sight distances , that depend on the @xmath9 zeropoint ; and results , such as mean abundances and abundance dispersions , that depend on the @xmath9 zeropoint and the @xmath10 transformation and zeropoint .",
    "it is immediately apparent from fig .  1 that the morphology of the horizontal branch ( hb ) in and  i is dominated by red hb stars .",
    "however , it is equally obvious that blue hb stars occur and , as da  costa et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have shown , rr lyrae variables are also present . if we use a hb morphology index @xmath11 of the form @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the numbers of blue and red hb stars , respectively ( see da  costa et al .",
    "1996 for formal definition of these quantities ) , then @xmath11 = 0.13 @xmath15 0.01 for and  i. as discussed below , the mean abundance for and  i is @xmath16[fe / h]@xmath17 = 1.45 @xmath15 0.2 dex . at this abundance , the hb morphologies of galactic globular clusters that follow the ( hb morphology , [ fe / h ] ) relation defined by the majority of such clusters , have relatively many more blue hb stars and many fewer red hb stars than does and i. for example , the standard globular cluster m5 , which has a similar abundance to and  i , has @xmath11 @xmath18 0.75 . for this reason",
    ", we can say unequivocally that and  i shows the second parameter effect in the same way as do many of the galactic dsph companions .",
    "da  costa et al .",
    "( 1996 ) go on to argue that in and  i , the dominance of red hb stars results from a mean age for the bulk of the population that is younger than that of the galactic globular clusters , though the presence of blue hb and rr  lyrae stars testifies to the presence of a minority older population .",
    "in other words , the and  i cmd implies that star formation in this dsph has continued for an extended period .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the results of mighell & rich ( 1996 ) for the galactic dsph leo  ii , which has similar hb morphology and mean abundance to and  i. mighell & rich ( 1996 ) used wfpc2 data that reaches below the main sequence turnoff to infer that the mean age of the stellar population in leo  ii is @xmath09 gyr , with the majority of the star formation having occurred in a @xmath04 gyr interval about that epoch , though some older stars are also present .",
    "our wfpc2 cmd for and  ii is similar to that shown for and  i in fig .  1 .",
    "in particular , once again the hb morphology is dominated by red stars though , as for and  i , blue hb and candidate rr  lyrae variable stars are also present . indeed , there are relatively more blue hb stars in the and  ii cmd than is the case for and  i : the hb morphology index for and  ii is @xmath11 = 0.18 @xmath15 0.02 ( cf",
    ".  @xmath11 = 0.13 @xmath15 0.01 for and i ) .",
    "given the somewhat higher mean abundance of and  ii ( @xmath16[fe / h]@xmath17 @xmath18 1.3 , see below ) and its large abundance dispersion , this dsph is less obviously a strong second parameter candidate in the way and  i is .",
    "nevertheless , it is likely that the second parameter effect is at work in and  ii .",
    "for example , the standard galactic globular cluster m4 , which has an abundance similar to the and  ii mean , has a relatively evenly populated hb with @xmath11 = 0.45 @xmath15 0.05 , while ngc  362 , which also has an abundance similar to the and  ii mean , has a dominant red hb morphology with @xmath11 = 0.04 @xmath15 0.02 .",
    "this latter cluster is one of the ` classic ' galactic halo second parameter clusters and has an age @xmath02 gyr younger than the majority of galactic halo globular clusters .",
    "we conclude therefore , pending further analysis , that the and  ii cmd does show the second parameter effect and that the most likely cause is that the bulk of the stellar population in and  ii is somewhat younger than the age of most galactic halo globular clusters .",
    "perhaps the most interesting result concerning hb morphology , however , is that in and  i it varies with distance from the galaxy s center . inside the core radius",
    "we find no radial variation in the hb morphology index , but outside the core radius the relative number of blue hb stars increases by approximately a factor of two .",
    "in other words , the blue hb stars in and  i are more widely distributed than the red hb stars that make up the bulk of the population .",
    "the origin of this radial gradient is not easily identified but the most likely explanation is that at the epoch of its initial episode of star formation , the proto - and  i was more spatially extended than it was when the bulk of the stars formed .",
    "apparently similar hb morphology gradients are also present in two ( sculptor and leo  ii ) of the three galactic dsphs where there is sufficient data to consider the question .",
    "we have not yet performed the equivalent analysis on our and  ii data .      for and  i ,",
    "the mean magnitude of the horizontal branch is @xmath2 = 25.25 @xmath15 0.04 mag . adopting a reddening e(@xmath8 )",
    "= 0.04 and the distance scale based on the horizontal branch models of lee et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , in which @xmath19(hb ) = 0.17[fe / h ] + 0.82 mag , the line - of - sight distance to and  i is 810 @xmath15 30 kpc for a mean abundance of @xmath16[fe / h]@xmath17 = 1.45 @xmath15 0.2 dex .",
    "this distance agrees well with that , 790 @xmath15 60 kpc , derived by mould & kristian ( 1990 ) from the @xmath6 magnitude of the and  i red giant branch tip .",
    "the most directly comparable distance determinations for m31 , based on either red giant branch tip stars or rr lyraes in the m31 halo or horizontal branch stars in m31 globular clusters , are 760 @xmath15 45 kpc or 850 @xmath15 20 kpc , both on the same distance scale ( see the discussion in da  costa et al .",
    "we can then conclude only that the relative m31/and  i line - of - sight distance is 0 @xmath15 70 kpc .",
    "given that and  i lies @xmath045 kpc in projection from the center of m31 , the true distance of and  i from the center of m31 then lies between @xmath045 and @xmath085 kpc .",
    "the lower limit is smaller than the galactocentric distances of any of the galaxy s dsph companions with the exception of sagittarius , while the upper limit is comparable to the galactocentric distances of the nearer galactic dsphs such as ursa minor , sculptor and draco .    for and  ii , the mean magnitude of the horizontal branch is @xmath2 = 24.90 @xmath15 0.04 mag from which we can immediately infer that and",
    "ii lies closer to us than and  i. indeed , adopting the same distance scale and reddening as above , and assuming a mean metal abundance of @xmath16[fe / h]@xmath17 @xmath18 1.3 ( see next section ) , we find that and  ii lies at a distance of 690 @xmath15 25 kpc , or 120 @xmath15 70 kpc in front of m31 along the line - of - sight .",
    "this is consistent with the ground - based results of konig et al .",
    "( 1993 ) who found and  ii to be 0.4 @xmath15 0.2 mag closer than m31 . on the sky and  ii lies closer to m33 than m31 . however , our results now unambiguously associate and  ii with m31 since m33 lies @xmath0150 kpc beyond m31 along the line of sight .",
    "when combined with and  ii s projected distance of @xmath0130 kpc from the center of m31 , these estimates indicate that the true distance of this dsph from the center of m31 lies between @xmath0150 and @xmath0240 kpc .",
    "the lower limit corresponds approximately to the galactocentric distance of fornax while the upper limit is similar to the galactocentric distances of the leo systems , the most distant of the galactic dsph companions . and",
    "ii , however , may not be the most distant of the m31 dsph companions , since and vi ( see below ) lies at least @xmath0270 kpc ( the projected distance ) from m31 .",
    "with the distances established , the mean metal abundances of these dsphs can be determined via the comparison of the dsph cmds with the giant branches of galactic globular clusters whose [ fe / h ] values are well known .",
    "an example of this is shown in fig .  1 where the giant branches of five standard globular clusters , whose abundances range from [ fe / h ] = 2.1 to [ fe / h ] = 0.7 , are overlaid on the and  i wfpc2 observations .",
    "da  costa et al .",
    "( 1996 ) discuss the mean abundance determination process in some detail and their conclusion is that the mean abundance of and  i is @xmath16[fe / h]@xmath17 = 1.45 @xmath15 0.2 dex .",
    "the uncertainty given includes uncertainty in the calibration relation , the statistical error in the observed giant branch mean color , and the effect of an adopted @xmath150.03 mag systematic uncertainty in the @xmath8 color zeropoint .",
    "this value , however , is in good accord with that , @xmath16[fe / h]@xmath17 = 1.4 @xmath15 0.2 , determined by mould & kristian ( 1990 ) from the mean @xmath20 color of and  i s upper red giant branch .",
    "further , there does not appear to be any change in this mean abundance with distance from the center of and  i.    application of the same technique to the and  ii wfpc2 cmd yields a mean abundance of @xmath16[fe / h]@xmath17 @xmath18 1.3 , with an uncertainty comparable to that derived for and  i. this mean abundance is somewhat more metal - rich than previous ground - based determinations . for example , konig et al .",
    "( 1993 ) give @xmath16[fe / h]@xmath17 = 1.59 ( + 0.44,0.12 ) from their gunn system @xmath21,@xmath14 cmd study while armandroff ( 1994 ) lists @xmath16[fe / h]@xmath17 = 1.63 @xmath15 0.25 from the mean giant branch color in a @xmath22 cmd .",
    "this relatively high mean abundance for and  ii derived from the wfpc2 data has an interesting consequence : at @xmath16[fe / h]@xmath17 @xmath18 1.3 and @xmath19 @xmath18 11.6 ( which is based on the new distance derived above ) , and  ii now deviates significantly from the relation between mean abundance and absolute magnitude apparently followed by most dsph and de galaxies ( cf .",
    "18 of caldwell et al .",
    "for example , this mean abundance for and  ii exceeds that of the fornax dsph , a system which is more than two magnitudes more luminous .",
    "the lack of image crowding on the wfpc2 images permits the photometric errors , unlike the case for ground - based images , to approach the photon statistics limit for all but the very brightest stars , where systematic effects seem to limit the precision to @xmath00.015 mag ( see da  costa et al .",
    "1996 ) . consequently",
    ", investigating the _ intrinsic _ color width of the giant branch in these wfpc2 cmds is relatively straightforward .",
    "the occurrence of internal ranges in abundance is one of the characteristics of the galactic dsph galaxies and the m31 dsph companions prove to be no exceptions . for and  i , the results of da  costa et al .",
    "( 1996 ) can be summarized as follows : on the upper part of the red giant branch , there is an intrinsic color spread that exceeds by a substantial factor the color spread expected on the basis of the photometric errors alone . applying the same calibration as for the mean abundance , this color spread can be characterized in a number of ways .",
    "for example , @xmath23([fe / h ] ) = 0.20 dex , the inter - quartile range is 0.30 dex , the central two - thirds of the sample abundance range is 0.45 dex , and the full range of the sample is @xmath00.6 dex .",
    "these values are comparable to those seen in galactic dsphs .",
    "for example , suntzeff ( 1993 ) lists values of @xmath23([fe / h ] ) for five galactic dsphs that range from @xmath00.2 to @xmath00.3 dex .    on the other hand , konig et al .",
    "( 1993 ) have suggested that the internal abundance range in and  ii is unusually large , with @xmath23([fe / h ] ) @xmath18 0.43 dex , though they admit that their photometric errors , which have to be subtracted in quadrature from their observed color dispersion , are large and not well constrained .",
    "thus the validity of their result is questionable .",
    "however , our wfpc2 data appear also to indicate that the intrinsic abundance distribution in this dsph is quite broad , much broader than could be explained by the photometric errors alone . further , because we have essentially two sets of data resulting from the two different pointings , our photometric errors are well determined ( and small ) . applying a similar analysis technique to that used by da  costa et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for and  i , we find that @xmath23([fe / h ] ) @xmath18 0.38 dex for and  ii , while the inter - quartile range is 0.65 dex , the central two - thirds of the sample abundance range is 0.85 dex and the full range of the sample is @xmath01.4 dex .",
    "these numbers are significantly larger than those for and  i. we thus have the interesting situation of two m31 companion dsphs , of similar luminosity and mean abundance , yet whose internal abundance ranges appear to be substantially different .",
    "this result reinforces the point that the internal abundance distributions of the local group dsphs apparently do not seem to readily correlate with luminosity in the way that the mean abundances do .",
    "indeed the internal abundance distribution is a characteristic that has the potential to provide additional significant constraints on the star formation and enrichment histories in these galaxies .",
    "further discussion of this point , however , is beyond the scope of this contribution .",
    "and i , ii & iii were found by van den bergh ( 1972 , 1974 ) using the palomar schmidt and iiiaj plates to survey 700 square degrees around m31 .",
    "a number of surveys for nearby dwarf galaxies have been undertaken in recent years .",
    "irwin ( 1994 ) reported a survey for nearby dwarfs using automated star counts on sky survey plates covering over 20,000 square degrees of high - latitude sky .",
    "this survey revealed the sextans dwarf spheroidal ( irwin et al .",
    "whiting et al .",
    "( 1997 ) visually examined survey plates of the entire southern sky , finding the antlia dwarf .",
    "neither of these surveys would be expected to reveal new m31 companions because , in the first instance , m31 is too distant for its companions to resolve into stars on sky survey plates and because , in the second instance , m31 is a northern object .    because van den bergh s ( 1972 , 1974 ) survey yielded a total of three m31 dwarf spheroidals , when the galaxy has nine , it has been recognized that additional m31 companions may be awaiting new surveys .",
    "two other factors suggest that a new survey may be profitable : 1 ) the absolute magnitudes of and i , ii & iii are significantly brighter than the faintest galactic dwarf spheroidals ( see fig .  2 of armandroff 1994 ) ; 2 ) the radial extent of van den bergh s ( 1972 , 1974 ) survey does not reach the galactocentric distances of the most distant galactic dwarfs ( see fig .",

    "ii regions are detected .",
    "the lack of h@xmath26 emission rules out current high - mass star formation in and vi and serves as further evidence that and vi is a dwarf spheroidal .",
    "like and i , ii , iii & v , and vi is not detected in any of the iras far - infrared bands . armandroff et al .",
    "( 1999b ) are constructing a cmd for and vi based on images obtained with the wiyn 3.5-m telescope during excellent seeing conditions ( @xmath4 , @xmath2 & @xmath6 ) .",
    "grebel & guhathakurta ( 1999 ) have presented a cmd for and vi based on images from the keck - ii telescope in @xmath2 and @xmath6 , which clearly shows the red giant branch .",
    "based on the @xmath6 magnitude of the red giant branch tip , they determined a line - of - sight distance of 780 @xmath15 40 kpc , associating and vi with m31 .",
    "from the position of the red giant branch relative to standard globular cluster fiducials , grebel & guhathakurta found @xmath16[fe / h]@xmath17 = 1.2 @xmath15 0.3 .",
    "they also measured an intrinsic central surface brightness of 24.5 mag / arcsec@xmath27 in @xmath2 .",
    "grebel & guhathakurta ( 1999 ) also obtained similar data for the cas dwarf from keck - ii .",
    "as for and vi , their cmd clearly shows the red giant branch , and from it they derived a distance and mean metallicity .",
    "their line - of - sight distance of 710 @xmath15 35 kpc places the cas dwarf in the extended m31 satellite system .",
    "the resulting metallicity is @xmath16[fe / h]@xmath17 = 1.3 @xmath15 0.3 .",
    "grebel & guhathakurta also measured an extinction - corrected central surface brightness of 23.6 mag / arcsec@xmath27 in @xmath2 . both and vi and the cas dwarf have apparent central surface brightnesses that are much brighter than and v , and somewhat brighter than and i , ii & iii . both and vi and the cas dwarf are outside of van den bergh s ( 1972 , 1974 ) survey area , which likely accounts for their anonymity until now .",
    "once accurate @xmath28 values are measured for and v , and vi and cas , and once their @xmath16[fe / h]@xmath17 values are established with definity , it will be important to re - evaluate whether the m31 and galactic dsphs follow the same relations between absolute magnitude , central surface brightness , and mean metal abundance",
    ". the sample will be twice as large and the data of higher quality than the previous determinations ( e.g. , fig .",
    "7 of armandroff 1994 ) .",
    "the discovery of the m31 dwarf spheroidals and v , and vi = pegasus dwarf , and cas dwarf doubles the number of known m31 dsphs .",
    "this changes the properties of m31 s satellite system , as discussed below .",
    "the most obvious change is that m31 is not as poor in dwarf spheroidals as previously thought .",
    "karachentsev ( 1996 ) discussed the spatial distribution of the companions to m31 .",
    "the discovery of and v , and vi and cas changes the spatial distribution of the m31 satellites .",
    "curiously , and i , ii & iii are all located south of m31 , while the three more luminous dwarf elliptical companions ngc 147 , 185 & 205 are all positioned north of m31 . also , karachentsev ( 1996 ) noted that there are more m31 companions overall south of m31 than north of m31 .",
    "the locations of and v and cas north of m31 lessen both of these asymmetries ( though and vi is south of m31 ; see fig .  2 ) . with",
    "projected radii from the center of m31 of 112 , 271 and 224 kpc , respectively , and v , and vi and cas increase the mean projected radius of the m31 dwarf spheroidals from 86 kpc to 144 kpc .",
    "the discovery of nearby dwarf galaxies like and v , and vi and cas augments the faint end of the luminosity function of the local group .",
    "we do not yet have reliable @xmath28 values for and v , and vi or cas , but they appear to be in the range @xmath29 .",
    "this increases the number of galaxies in the local group in this @xmath28 range by 27% . from a survey of nine clusters of galaxies , trentham ( 1998 )",
    "derived a composite luminosity function that is steeper at the faint end than that of the local group ( see his fig .  2 ) .",
    "he attributed the difference to poor counting statistics and/or incompleteness among the local group sample .",
    "the discovery of and v , and vi and cas reduces somewhat the discrepancy between the local group luminosity function and the extrapolation of trentham s ( 1998 ) function .",
    "several opportunities for advancing our understanding of m31 s dwarf spheroidal companions are apparent :    * the search for dsph companions to m31 is not yet complete .",
    "the ongoing searches based on the poss - ii may reveal additional companions .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey should allow a significantly deeper search for faint , low surface brightness m31 companions .",
    "* it will be valuable to obtain hst / wfpc2 cmds for all six m31 dwarf spheroidals .",
    "these cmds will yield precise line - of - sight distances , hopefully facilitating a 3-dimensional map of the distribution of m31 satellites . whether this distribution is random or exhibits `` streams ''",
    "will provide an interesting comparison with the galactic dsph distribution . also , having hb morphologies for all six known m31 dsphs will allow a more comprehensive evaluation of the second parameter effect in the halo of m31 .",
    "* no information is currently available about the h i content of and ii , and v , and vi or cas dwarf via 21 cm observations .",
    "either h i detections or strict upper limits would be valuable .",
    "the upper limits for and i & iii should be refined ( see thuan & martin 1979 ) .",
    "* measurements of radial velocity are possible for red giants at the m31 distance with 810 meter telescopes .",
    "one can constrain the total mass of m31 via the velocity dispersion of its dwarf satellite system ( as , for example , zaritsky et al .",
    "1989 did for the galaxy ) .",
    "the impressive projected radii of and vi and cas will result in mass limits to very large radii .",
    "* radial velocities will also allow mass - to - light ratios ( m / l ) to be derived for the m31 dsphs .",
    "measurement of a high m / l for an m31 dsph would be a step toward universalizing the large velocity dispersions and consequent large m / l values observed for galactic dsphs .",
    "also , the large galactocentric radii of and ii , and vi and cas should render tidal effects negligible .",
    "we are grateful to our collaborators , nelson caldwell and pat seitzer on the and ii wfpc2 cmd , and james davies and george jacoby on the m31 dsph survey , for allowing us to present results in advance of publication and for helpful discussions .",
