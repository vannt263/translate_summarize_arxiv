    "the main aim of theoretical models is to explain the available experimental results and predict the properties of the atomic nuclei through out the periodic table .",
    "a good description of the properties of known nuclei gives us more confidence in extrapolating to the yet unexplored areas of the nuclear chart .",
    "the two - neutron separation energy @xmath3 systematically derived from the ground state binding energy ( be ) , reveal a new feature for the existence of _ islands of inversion _ in the exotic neutron - rich regions of nuclear landscape .",
    "the shell model ( sm ) calculation  @xcite is successful in nuclear structure theory .",
    "although the application of this model in various regions explain the data quite well , it fails to reproduce the binding energy for some of the neutron - rich ne , na and mg nuclei @xcite .",
    "almost two decades ago patra et al .",
    "@xcite performed the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) calculation with nl1 parameter set and could explain the reason of failure of shell model for these nuclei .",
    "one of their explanation is the large deformation of these nuclei which are not taken in the sm calculation .",
    "recently apart from supporting the presently known islands around @xmath4  @xcite and @xmath5  @xcite regions , the inm model  @xcite predict one more region around z = 60 of stability .",
    "it was suggested that these nuclei of z = 17 - 23 , n = 38 - 42 , z= 37 - 40 , n = 70 - 74 and z = 60 - 64 , n = 110 - 116 regions are deformed and form _ islands of inversion _ with more binding energy than their neighbouring family of isotopes .",
    "this prediction motivate us to study the properties of such nuclei and to investigate the possible reasons of the extra stability . in the present paper , we have done the calculation for these three regions by using the axially deformed rmf model .",
    "the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model  @xcite become famous in recent years and have been applied to finite nuclei and infinite nuclear matter .",
    "we have taken the rmf lagrangian  @xcite with nl3 * parameter set  @xcite in our study .",
    "this force parameter is successful in both @xmath6-stable and drip - line nuclei .",
    "the lagrangian contained the term of interaction between meson and nucleon and also self - interaction of isoscalar - scalar _ sigma _ meson .",
    "the other mesons are isoscalar - vector _",
    "omega _ and isovector vector _ rho _ mesons .",
    "the photon field @xmath7 is included to take care of coulombic interaction of protons .",
    "a definite set of coupled equations are obtained from the above lagrangian are solved self - consistently in an axially deformed harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "we start with the relativistic lagrangian density for a nucleon - meson many - body system , @xmath8 here sigma meson field is denoted by @xmath9 , omega meson field by @xmath10 and rho meson field is denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 denotes the electromagnetic field , which couples to the protons .",
    "@xmath13 are the dirac spinors for the nucleons , whose third components of isospin is @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18,@xmath19 , @xmath20 are the coupling constants . the center of mass ( c.m . )",
    "motion energy correction is estimated by the harmonic oscillator formula @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the mass number of the nucleus .",
    "the total quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath23 of the nucleus , can be obtained from the relation @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the quadrupole moment for neutron and proton respectively and r is the nuclear radius . the root mean square charge radius(@xmath27 ) ,",
    "proton radius @xmath28 , neutron radius @xmath29 and matter radius ( @xmath30 ) are given as  @xcite : @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 here all terms have own usual meaning . the total binding energy and other observables",
    "are also obtained by using the standard relations , given in  @xcite .",
    "pairing correlation is playing very crucial role in open shell nuclei . in our calculation",
    "we are using the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) pairing for determining the bulk properties like binding energy ( be ) , quadrupole deformation parameter and nuclear radii .",
    "the pairing energy can be given as : @xmath35 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where g is pairing force constant and @xmath36 , @xmath37 are occupation probabilities respectively  @xcite .",
    "the simple form of bcs equation can be derived from the variational method with respect to the occupation number @xmath36 : @xmath38 using @xmath39 .",
    "the above equation  [ eq : bcs ] is known as bcs equation for pairing energy .",
    "the occupation number is defined as : @xmath40.\\ ] ]    in our calculation we are dealing with the nuclei far away from beta stability line , so the constant gap for proton and neutron used here is valid in considered region . these constant gap equation for proton and neutron",
    "is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite which is given as : @xmath41 and @xmath42 with @xmath43=5.72 , @xmath44=0.118 , @xmath45= 8.12 , @xmath46=1 , and @xmath47 .    in our present calculation , we have taken the constant pairing gap for all states @xmath48 near the fermi surface for the shake of simplicity . as we know",
    ", if we go near the very neutron drip line , then coupling to the continuum become important  @xcite . in this case",
    "we should use the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) approach which is more accurate formalism for this region .",
    "but by using bcs pairing correlation model , it has been shown that the results from relativistic mean field bcs ( rmf - bcs ) approach is almost similar with the rhb formalism  @xcite .",
    "we divide our calculation between three regions : first region having z=17 -23 , and second region z= 37 - 40 and third region z=60 - 64 . for checking the proper basis ,",
    "we calculate the physical observables like binding energy , root mean square ( rms ) radii and quadrupole deformation parameter(@xmath49 ) .",
    "so we have taken heavier nuclei from each region for example @xmath50 from region i , @xmath51 from region ii and @xmath52 from region iii .",
    "we have presented our calculations in table  [ tab : basis ] , with @xmath53=@xmath54 = 6 to 16 , in the interval of 2 , at the initial deformation of @xmath49=0.2 , using the nl3 * parameter set . for @xmath50 nuclei ; be , rms radii and @xmath49 are almost same for @xmath53=@xmath54 @xmath55 10 .",
    "it means , we can take @xmath56 for boson and fermion harmonic basis for region i. in @xmath51 nucleus ; these physical observables change from @xmath53=@xmath54= 10 to 12 . but become constant after @xmath53=@xmath54= 12 .",
    "then if we combine these two region and take @xmath57=12 , then we have enough space for both region .",
    "one can easily see that for @xmath52 nucleus @xmath57=12 is not sufficient model space .",
    "it needs more space for calculation .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we have taken @xmath57=12 for region i , ii and @xmath57=14 for region iii .",
    "similar calculation are found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "[ tab : basis ]    .calculated binding energy be(mev ) , root mean square @xmath27 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath49 at different bosonic and fermionic basis harmonic quanta .",
    "root mean square radius are in @xmath61 . during this calculation",
    "we have taken initial deformation parameter @xmath62 equal to 0.2 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "taking rmf as a reference , we evaluate @xmath63 and @xmath64 . analyzing fig . 1 , we find both @xmath63 and @xmath64 similar for all the considered six nuclei , cl to ti .",
    "the large value of @xmath63 and @xmath64 at middle of the region shows the speciality of these nuclei , except cl isotopes [ fig .",
    "all other isotopes show similar trend with inm and frdm . from fig . 2 and fig .",
    "3 , @xmath63 are almost constant , if one extends the calculation to higher mass number in isotopic chain . on the other hand , calculated @xmath64 goes on increasing with a. in this situation , the predictive power of rmf , frdm and inm are questionable .",
    "for example , ( 1 ) if we consider rmf as the absolute reference frame , then the large discrepancy of @xmath64 with mass number indicate the failure of inm near the drip - line region , or vice versa , ( 2 ) similarly if we analyze for @xmath63 , it is somewhat constant with rmf for the entire region considered in the present paper . as we have discussed in the subsection 3 , the rmf is based on microscopic origin in mesons and nucleons level . except few fitted nuclei , all others masses , radii and quadrupole deformation",
    "are the predicted results for a large region of the periodic chart .",
    "the rmf results are found to be good for almost all the known cases .",
    "this prediction not only confine to masses , radii , @xmath49 but also comes well for other observables .",
    "thus , if we believe all these predictions as success , then the mass formula specially inm needed some modification , specially in the region of z = 37 - 40 and z = 60 - 64 which are considered in the current work .",
    "in summary , we have calculated the binding energy , rms charge and matter radii , quadrupole deformation parameter for the neutron drip - line nuclei having z = 17 - 23 , 37 - 40 and 60 - 64 regions using rmf(nl3 * ) which are recently predicted to be in _ islands of inversion _ due to their extra stability compared to the near by isotopes . since the considered isotopes are experimentally unknown , we compared our results with various mass formula predictions .",
    "we found large differences both in binding energy and deformation indicating the special nature of these nuclei .",
    "we got some interesting features just like jerk and deep at some places in charge distribution radius which is different from our conventional distribution . in regions z = 17 - 23 ,",
    "n = 42 , z = 37 - 40 , n = 68 , and z= 60 - 64 , n = 112 behave as more stable .",
    "the true properties of these nuclei can be revealed after the experimental observations .",
