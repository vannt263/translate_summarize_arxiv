    "experimental measurements confirm this prediction  @xcite , and it was found that at low frequencies a sample in a surface superconducting state ( sss ) shows ac losses with a peak whose position with respect to the dc field depends on the ac amplitude .",

    "if we assume that the reason for this discrepancy with experimental data , is the small value of the critical surface current , which is much smaller than the current amplitudes at the surface , then we have to expect a decreasing of the losses approximately as @xmath26 when the amplitude of the applied ac field , @xmath22 , increases . on the contrary",

    "we found that some features of nonlinear response took place at a very weak ac field with amplitude @xmath27 oe . the ac response at the third harmonic of the fundamental frequency did not leave any room for the perturbation theory .",
    "it was proposed that the losses in sss are due to the slow relaxation of the order parameter at the surface and could not be ascribed to surface vortices .",
    "we found that for small @xmath22 in quasilinear approximation the integral equation with power dependent nuclear governed the time behavior of the magnetization in ac fields .",
