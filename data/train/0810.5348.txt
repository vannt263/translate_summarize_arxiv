    "a decade after the milestone discoveries of the first extrasolar planet ( mayor & queloz 1995 ) , the first planetary system ( butler et al . 1999 ) , and the first transiting planet ( henry et al . 2000 ; charbonneau et al . 2000 ) precision doppler surveys remain the dominant method for finding extrasolar planets orbiting nearby stars . most of the planets orbiting stars within 100pc have been found from precision velocity surveys .",
    "current surveys now cover nearly all main sequence g and k stars within 50 pc .",
    "northern hemisphere planet radial velocity surveys include the lick 3-m , elodie 1.93-m , keck 10-m , and the het 11-m .",
    "surveys in the southern hemisphere include the harps 3.6-m , aat 3.9-m , and the coralie 1.2-m .    with the unexpected diversity of extrasolar planets found to date ( butler et al .",
    "2006 ) , every new planet continues to contribute to our understanding .",
    "planets around the stars closer than 100 pc are especially valuable as these are the stars that will be prime targets for studies by future interferometry and direct imaging missions .    in this work we present the detection of low - mass companions to five nearby solar - type stars , including four of planetary mass , and one likely brown dwarf .",
    "the brightest two of the objects reported here have previously been detected by the coralie team ( santos et al .",
    "2001 ; mayor et al .",
    "these sub - stellar companions were found by the magellan precision doppler survey , which has been operated over the past 4 years , and is focused on late f , g , k , and m dwarfs within 50 pc .",
    "this program is complementary to the magellan n2k search for `` hot jupiters '' ( fischer et al .",
    "2003 ; lopez - morales et al .",
    "2008 ) , which surveys metal rich stars primarily beyond 50 pc , with time allocated by the chilean national tac .",
    "the same hardware and software reduction packages are used by both programs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 provides an overview of the magellan planet search program .",
    "section 3 contains a summary of properties of the 5 stars , doppler velocity measurements , and best - fit orbital solutions for companions .",
    "a discussion is given in section 4 .",
    "the magellan planet search program makes use of the mike echelle spectrograph ( bernstein et al .",
    "2003 ) on the 6.5-m magellan ii ( clay ) telescope .",
    "the resolution of these spectra is r @xmath2 50000 , spanning wavelengths from 39006200  , divided into a blue and a red ccd .",
    "wavelength calibration is carried out by means of an iodine absorption cell ( marcy & butler 1992 ) which superimposes a reference iodine spectrum directly on the stellar spectra .",
    "thar lamps are not used in any part of the reduction .",
    "the wavelength solution is derived directly from the iodine spectrum , using the spectral  atlas \" of this cell taken with the nist fts spectrometer at a resolution of 1,000,000 and a s / n of 1,000 as the metric ( butler et al .",
    "1996 ; valenti et al .",
    "the standard iodine technique works between 5000   and 6200  .",
    "below 5000  , iodine molecules disassociate , so there are no lines . above 6200    iodine lines",
    "are too weak to be useful , unless the iodine cell is heated to several hundred degrees c. thus , only the spectral orders of the mike red ccd are used to measure the radial velocities , while the blue orders are used to monitor the activity of the caii h and k lines .",
    "we have monitored a number of stable main sequence stars of spectral types ranging from late f to mid k. several example of these rv stable stars are shown in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "this system currently achieves measurement precision of 5 , as demonstrated by these figures .",
    "the magellan precision doppler survey began in december 2004 , and is currently surveying about 400 main sequence dwarfs ranging in spectral type from late f to mid ",
    "the spectrum of stars earlier than f7 do not contain enough doppler information to achieve precision of 5 , while stars later than m5 are too faint even for a 6.5-m telescope .",
    "magellan / mike can reach 5 m / s for stars as faint at v=9 with 10 minute exposures .. the stars in the magellan program have been chosen to minimize overlap with the aat 3.9-m and keck 10-m surveys .",
    "subgiants have not been removed .",
    "stellar jitter for subgiants is small , @xmath3 5 m / s .",
    "stars more than 2 magnitudes above the main sequence have much larger jitter , thus have been removed from the observing list based on hipparcos distances ( perryman et al .",
    "1997 , esa 1997 ) .    stars with known stellar companions within 2 arcsec are also removed from the observing list as it is operationally difficult to get an uncontaminated spectrum of a star with a nearby companion .",
    "otherwise there is no bias against observing multiple stars .",
    "the magellan target stars also contain no bias against brown dwarf companions .",
    "this paper reports on four planet  mass candidates and a brown dwarf candidate that have emerged from the magellan survey .",
    "the stellar properties of the five host stars are given in table 1 .",
    "the first two columns provide the hd catalog number and the hipparcos catalog number respectively .",
    "spectral types are from a calibration of @xmath4 and hipparcos derived absolute magnitudes .",
