    "this leads to a slightly different state population depending on the applied electric field , which translates to different cross - talks as we change the applied electric field . + in the comparison between the observed transfer efficiencies of the quasi - forbidden resonances and their calculated interaction strengths , most features are well reproduced .",
    "the small differences should be ascribed to few experimental and theoretical issues .",
    "first of all , because the gate analysis is not precisely adapted to each state produced by the various resonances , the measured transfers have an indetermination very hard to evaluate .",
    "indeed for most of the resonances , we only detect correctly half of the final states ( the @xmath33 or the @xmath60 states ) with an uncertainty coming mainly from the imperfect cross - talk compensation between temporal gates .",
    "then we assume that the quasi - forbidden resonances transfer the same atom number in the second final states ( the @xmath187 or the @xmath34 states respectively ) , leading to a quite large total transfer efficiency uncertainty . a good example of this issue is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tof ] where even a @xmath188 state change modifies significantly the tof output .",
    "this issue is particularly important for states as the @xmath171 ones which ionize mainly within the @xmath34 gates .",
    "the second issue playing a role within the calculated strengths is the weak coupling assumption certainly not valid for the strongest resonances .",
    "in addition , the average over all signs of initial @xmath188 with equal weights might not be valid as the experiment might generate an imbalance .",
    "finally , we have not considered the role of the small but finite mot magnetic field , splitting the resonances by at most @xmath189  mv / cm  @xcite . within our set - up , such a splitting can not be observed directly and its role on the final transfer efficiency is not at all clear .",
    "to conclude , we have seen that in the vicinity of the allowed 2-body frster resonance many quasi - forbidden 2-body frster resonances are also present .",
    "they show an estimated total transfer up to @xmath159 ( taking into account both final states ) , with a calculated dipole - dipole coupling around @xmath190 of the dipole allowed resonance coupling . in presence of a low electric field ,",
    "the dipole - dipole coupling in those quasi - forbidden frster resonances allow population transfer with a change in the orbital quantum number from a  labelled \" @xmath34-state to a  labelled \" @xmath146-state or allow transfer involving no change of the @xmath21-state between the initial and final states .",
    "we can assume that at a higher field @xmath191 resonances due to @xmath21-mixing would appear as presented in  @xcite .",
    "we have also elaborated a graphical resolution of the resonance condition of frster resonances , allowing to identify clearly the position of the different quasi - forbidden frster resonances .",
    "then we calculated the dipole - dipole coupling strength for all of the observed quasi - forbidden resonances which correspond to their measured relative amplitudes .",
    "+ when using the dipole allowed frster resonances for quantum computation , those quasi - forbidden resonances could perturb the allowed resonance and should be taken into account to determine the total interaction strength in presence of an electric field .",
    "moreover those quasi - forbidden 2-body frster resonances could be of interest in the case of potential processes requiring tunable interactions over a broad band of electric field , like in the search for few - body interactions or to realize macro - molecules built from rydberg atoms .",
    "indeed , they increase dramatically the number of addressable resonant energy transfers in the cesium atom with an efficiency about @xmath190 of the well - known dipole allowed resonances .",
    "for instance , it could increase the number of few - body transfer cascades as demonstrated in  @xcite .",
