    "individuals ( or agents ) employed in a naming game ( ng ) [ , ] are connected by a certain communication network .",
    "the network represents the relationships among involving agents , on which two agents can communicate directly with each other only if they are directly connected on the network .",
    "isolated agent is not allowed in the underlying network , which is not participating the game and hence can be removed , thus information can be propagated to every agent so that the whole population may eventually reach global consensus ( _ i.e. _ , convergence ) , in the sense that every agent keeps one and only one identical name to describe the object to be named .",
    "the convergence of ng may be observed via numerical simulations [ , , ] , proved theoretically [ ] , or verified empirically by humans [ ] . as to the underlying communication network , the random - graph [ ] , small - world [ ] and scale - free [ ] networks are the most widely used ones for naming games [ , , , , ] , which will also be employed in the present study .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] shows the flowchart of the minimal ng , of which the input includes : 1 ) a population of agents with empty memory , but each agent has infinite capacity of memory ; 2 ) a connected underlying network indicating the relationships among the agents ; 3 ) an infinite ( or large enough ) external lexicon which specifies a large number of different names ; 4 ) an object ( idea , convention , or event , etc . ) to be named by the population .",
    "the output is a population of consented agents , where every agent has one and only one identical name for the object in his memory .",
    "the convergence process will be recorded for analysis , in terms of _",
    "e.g. _ the _ number of total names _ and the _ number of different names _ in the population , as well as the _ success rate_. the changes with any input item will cause different converging features ; for example , the case when all agents have a limited memory size [ ] .            at each time step of the minimal ng , a pair of connected agents is randomly selected from the population , to be speaker and hearer respectively . if the object is unknown to the speaker , meaning that the speaker has no name in his memory to describe the object , then he will randomly pick a name from the external lexicon ( which is equivalent to randomly invent a new name within the certain number of words in the lexicon ) , and then utters the name to the hearer . when the object is already known to the speaker , namely the speaker has one or several names in his memory",
    ", he will randomly pick a name from the memory and then utter it .",
    "after the hearer receives the name , he will search over his memory to see if he has the same name stored therein : if not , then he will store it into the memory ; but if yes , then the hearer and the speaker reach consensus , so they both clear up all the names while keeping this common name in their respective memory .",
    "an example illustrating one time step of the pair - wise communication is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "this pair - wise success is referred to as local consensus hereafter .",
    "such a pair - wise transmitting and receiving ( or teaching and learning ) process will continue to iterate until eventually the entire population of agents reach consensus , referred to as global consensus , meaning that all the agents agree to describe the object by the same name .",
    "each node of the underlying network represents an agent in ng , while each edge means that the two connected nodes can communicated to each other directly , in either pair - wise [ , , , , ] or group - wise [ , , ] communication setting . the number of connections of a node is referred to as its degree .",
    "the heterogeneity of social networks can generally be reflected by the scale - free networks [ , , ] , where a few agents have much larger degrees than most agents that have very small degrees .",
    "on the other hand , human communications are community - based , in the sense that people belonging to the same community are much more actively interacting and communicating with each other than those in different communities .",
    "recall that the multi - local - world ( mlw ) model [ , ] is a kind of scale - free network , capable of capturing the essential features of many real - world networks with community structures .",
    "the degree distribution of the mlw network is neither in a completely exponential form nor in a completely power - law form , but is somewhere between them .",
    "in particular , the mlw model shows good performance on capturing basic features of the internet at the autonomous system ( as ) level [ ] .",
    "it is quite well known that human social networks also have as - like structures .",
    "therefore , it is quite reasonable to study a naming game of a population on an mlw communication network where a local world is a community formed not only by natural barriers such as mountains , rivers and oceans , but also by folkways , dialect and cultures . in this paper , therefore , naming game is studied under an mlw network framework , with three typical topologies of human communication networks , namely random - graph , small - world and scale - free networks , respectively .",
    "the main contributions of this study include the following findings : 1 ) when the intra - community connections increase while the inter - community connections remain to be unchanged , the convergence to global consensus is slow and eventually might fail ; 2 ) when the inter - community connections are sufficiently dense , both the number and the size of the communities do not affect the convergence process ; and 3 ) for different topologies with the same average node - degree , local clustering of individuals obstruct or prohibit global consensus to take place .",
    "the simulation results reveal the role of local communities in a global naming game in social networks .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the multi - local - world model is introduced , flowed by extensive simulation results with analysis in section iii .",
    "finally , section iv concludes the investigation .",
    "here and throughout , all random operations ( _ e.g. _ , random generation , selection , addition or deletion ) follow a uniform distribution .    the algorithm for generating an mlw network with @xmath0 nodes can be summarized as follows [ ] .",
    "the initialization starts with @xmath1 isolated local - worlds . within each local - world , there are @xmath2 nodes connected by @xmath3 edges . at each time step , a value @xmath4 , @xmath5 is generated at random .",

    "if @xmath9 , perform addition of a new node to a randomly selected local - world by preferential attachment : the new node is added to the selected local - world , establishing in @xmath10 new connections ( edges ) .",
    "the new node is connected to @xmath10 nodes existing in the local - world according to the following preferential probability : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the degree of node @xmath13 within the local - world @xmath14 and @xmath15 is a tunable parameter .    @xmath16 . if @xmath17 , perform addition of edges within a randomly selected local - world @xmath14 : @xmath18 edges are added to this @xmath14 . for each new edge",
    ", one end is connected to a randomly picked node within the @xmath14 , while the other end is connected to a node selected also from the same @xmath14 according to a probability @xmath19 given by eq  [ eq1 ] .",
    "this process repeats @xmath18 times .    @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath21 , perform deletion of edges within a randomly selected local - world @xmath14 : @xmath22 edges are deleted from @xmath14 . the purpose is to remove more edges that connect to small - degree nodes .",
    "to do so , randomly select a node from @xmath14 . remove the edges of this node one by one , according to the following probability where @xmath12 is the degree of the node at the other end of the edge : @xmath23 where @xmath1 is the number of nodes within the @xmath14 and @xmath19 is given by eq  [ eq1 ] .",
    "this process repeats @xmath22 times .    @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath25 , perform addition of edges among local - worlds : @xmath26 edges are added to connect different local - worlds .",
    "first , two different local - worlds are picked at random .",
    "then , one node is selected within each local - world according to the probability given by eq  [ eq1 ] .",
    "an edge is finally added between these two nodes .",
    "this process repeats @xmath26 times .",
    "the initial number of nodes is @xmath27 and the termination number is @xmath28 ( typically , much larger ) .",
    "the generation algorithm stops when totally @xmath0 nodes have been generated into the network .",
    "note that throughout the above process , the generation of repeated connections , self - loops and isolated nodes should be avoided or removed .",
    "the detailed generating algorithm of mlw networks as well as the calculation of its degree distribution can be found in [ ] . as shown above , there are totally eleven tunable parameters , among which only two parameters are of interest in the present paper , _",
    "i.e. _ , the number of local - worlds @xmath29 and the initial number @xmath2 of nodes within each local - world .    according to [ ] , it is hard for a population to reach globally consensus if the underlying network has multiple communities .",
    "the underlying network used in [ ] is a combination of several scale - free networks , where the combination is generated by a reversed preferential attachment probability .",
    "specifically , the intra - connections within each community are based on a preferential attachment probability given by eq  [ eq1 ] , while the inter - connections between communities are generated according the following preferential attachment probability : @xmath30 only bi - community and tri - community networks are studied in [ ] .    in this paper ,",
    "the mlw model introduced above will be employed , in which both the number @xmath29 and the initial size @xmath2 are tunable parameters . by simply adjusting these two parameters ,",
    "the ng can be performed on a set of more generalized networks with multiple communities , more realistic to represent the real human society and language development therein .",
    "@xmath31 & operation @xmath6 ( addition of new local - worlds ) is not performed + @xmath32 & operation @xmath8 ( addition of a new node to a local - world ) is performed with probability 0.28 + @xmath33 & operation @xmath16 ( addition of edges within a local - world ) is performed with probability 0.11 ( = 0.39 - 0.28 ) + @xmath34 &    [ cols= \" < \" , ]      +    [ tab : tab1 ]",
    "the minimal ng is studied on mlw networks for it simulates the internet as well as many social networks realistically .",
    "there are mainly eleven parameters , among which we are interest in only two , _",
    "i.e. _ , the number of local - worlds @xmath1 and the initial number @xmath2 of nodes within each local - world .",
    "the other nine out of eleven parameters are fixed , as set in [ ] , which are @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath3 , @xmath10 , @xmath18 , @xmath22 , and @xmath26 .",
    "their values are presented in tab .",
    "[ tab : tab1 ] , along with their correspondence or meanings of such parameter settings .",
    "as reported in [ ] , if the underlying network is fully - connected then ng converges in the fastest speed .",
    "so , in the following simulations , all the initial local - worlds are fully - connected , so the parameter @xmath39 .    next ,",
    "denote the number of individuals ( population size ) by @xmath0 , which satisfies @xmath40 otherwise there will be only @xmath1 isolated local - worlds , so the network is not connected [ ] . introduce a new parameter @xmath41 , as the rate of initially assigned nodes in the local - worlds : when @xmath42 , there is no local - world and the network degenerates to a scale - free one since every node is added by a preferential attachment ; when @xmath43 , it generates several isolated local - worlds without any additional nodes or edges .",
    "the purpose of introducing @xmath44 is to change the above inequality to be an equality : @xmath45 the comparing simulation is carried out by varying @xmath44 , @xmath2 , and @xmath1 .",

    "[ tab : tab2 ] .",
    "in addition , with a long time period @xmath56 , one has that @xmath57 which means that the number of different words is not changed during a long time .",
    "note also that @xmath58 is monotonically non - increasing in this converging ( or converged ) stage .",
    "this phenomenon can be observed from fig .",

    "the rate of initially assigned nodes is set to @xmath59 and 0.7 , respectively , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig4](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] that relatively small sizes of communities are beneficial for achieving convergence .",
    "since nodes within communities are fully - connected , this makes the intra - community convergence the fastest .",
    "in contrast , the strong intra -connection of different communities make the inter - community converge more difficult , especially when different communities had already converged to different words respectively .    in the box plot shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , the blue box indicates that the central 50% data lie in this section ; the red bar is the median value of all 30 datasets ; the upper and lower black bars are the greatest and least values , excluding outliers which are represented by the red pluses .",

    "[ tab : tab3 ] shows the average degrees , average path lengths and average clustering coefficients of all the generated mlw networks .",
    "it shows that as @xmath2 increases , both the average degree and average clustering coefficient increase , while the average path length decreases .",
    "this means that , on average , when @xmath2 increases , the networks are better connected , yet more clustered .",
    "better connections ( greater average degree and shorter average path length ) facilitate convergence in ng [ , ] , while local clustering and forming communities hinder convergence .",
    "at the extreme , one can assume that any sub - network in a fully - connected network is a local community .",
    "in this case , both intra - community and inter - community connections are maximized , thus there is no barrier existing amongst the communities in a fully - connected network .",
    "barriers preventing communities from global convergence are formed only if the intra - community connections are strong while the inter - community connections are weak .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] shows an example illustrating how the intra - connections become stronger when the community size increases .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , the ratio of intra - connections vs inter - connections is getting smaller as the community size is getting larger ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5](a ) 3:1 , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5](b ) 6:1 , and fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5](c ) 15:1 ) .",
    "if one wishes to keep the ratio constant , _",
    "e.g. _ , 3:1 , then for a 4-node community there should be 2 nodes being connected externally , while for a 6-node community the number of inter - connections should be 5 . note that the number of inter - community connections is fixed .",
    "the inter - connections are generated during the addition of @xmath68 nodes , repeatedly by randomly selecting operations from @xmath6 to @xmath24 ( defined in section ii ) .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] , if the number of inter - community connection is fixed , while the size of fully - connected community is growing , then the number of external connections is becoming insufficient for convergence .    in a nutshell , the inter - community connections of mlw networks should be kept constant , and the number and size of communities should be changed ( reducing the number of communities and enlarging the size of each community ) , so that intra - community connections are getting stronger . as a result , as intra - connections increase , while inter - connections are kept constant , the convergence process will be slowed down and eventually failed .",
    "this explains more clearly the incremental convergence time shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] .          in this section ,",
    "both the number and size of local - worlds are fixed , while the rate @xmath44 of initially assigned nodes is varied from 0.1 to 0.9 .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] , a common pattern is that , when @xmath44 is small enough ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath69 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6](a ) ; @xmath70 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6](b ) ; @xmath71 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6](c ) ) , different values of @xmath44 do not affect the convergence time at all .",
    "note that the inter - community connections are generated during the addition of @xmath72 nodes .",
    "when @xmath44 is small enough for certain networks , this means that the inter - community connections are substantial and probably sufficient already to achieve global convergence .",
    "as @xmath44 continues to increase , @xmath72 deceases , thus the inter - community connections are reducing and become insufficient if @xmath44 reaches certain large values ( _ i.e. _ , when @xmath73 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6](a ) ; @xmath74 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6](b ) ; @xmath75 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6](c ) ) .",
    "denote the threshold value by @xmath76 . then , when @xmath77 , the convergence time is not affected by @xmath44 , while when @xmath78 , the convergence time increases drastically as @xmath44 increases . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] , as @xmath2 increases ( @xmath79 ) , @xmath76 decreases ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "this phenomenon can also be observed when the population size is 500 and 1500 , respectively [ ] . this phenomenon can be explained by the example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] , where the number of intra - community connections is @xmath81 .",
    "this means that when @xmath2 is small , the number of intra - community connections is relatively small , so that the required inter - community connections become fewer , thus @xmath44 does not affect the convergence time , until that number becomes relatively large .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath2 is large , the number of intra - community connections is relatively large , thus even @xmath44 is relatively small , the convergence time is clearly affected , due to the large number requirement of inter - community connections .",
    "the convergence progress of mlw networks are compared on three typical topology networks , _",
    "i.e. _ , random - graph ( rg ) [ ] , small - world ( sw ) [ ] and scale - free ( sf ) [ ] networks .",
    "the comparison is implemented by the convergence progress in terms of the number of total words , the number of different words and the success rate . for fairness and also for convenience , four sets of data are chosen , with @xmath8210 , 20 , 30 and 100 , on which the average degrees of the mlw networks are 9.41 , 16.43 , 22.91 , 72.41 , respectively .",
    "these data values are used as the connecting probabilities , exactly for generating rg networks and approximately for generating sw and sf networks .",
    "the feature statistics of the generated networks are summarized in tab .  [",
    "tab : tab4 ] , together with the statistics of the mlw for reference .",
    "c +    [ tab : tab4 ]    as shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : tab4 ] , four types of networks have very similar values of average degrees . however , mlw has the longest average path length and the highest clustering coefficient values .",
    "sw is with the second longest average path length and the second highest clustering coefficient values .",
    "both rg and sf have smaller values on these two features .                in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] , [ fig : fig8]and [ fig : fig9 ] , the four cases of different parameter settings are : ( a ) @xmath83 , ( b ) @xmath84 , ( c ) @xmath85 , and ( d ) @xmath86 , and these four types of networks of the same ( or similar ) average degree are compared in the same figure for clarity .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] , the four sub - figures in the figure share two common phenomena : 1 ) the population with underlying network rg converges the fastest , followed by sf and sw .",
    "mlw converges the slowest infig .",
    "[ fig : fig7](a ) , but does not converge in the cases shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) ; 2 ) the curves with underlying network rg has the highest peak , followed by sf and sw , and mlw holds the lowest . as also shown in tab .  [ tab : tab4 ] , rg has the smallest clustering coefficient values , followed by sf and sw , and mlw has the greatest , meaning that mlw has strongest tendency in clustering and forming communities than the other three networks .",
    "sw has relatively strong tendency in clustering .",
    "this leads to the following two phenomena : 1 ) individuals within communities reach convergence quickly , so that the number of total words in the entire network decreases fast when there are communities ; and 2 ) the inter - community convergence process is delayed or even prevented by the multi - community topology .",
    "this can be further summarized as follows : given the same average degree , the less clustered network has a convergence curve with a higher peak and sharper decline ; while the more clustered network has a flatter curve with a lower peak .    note that when the underlying network is a tree ( with average degree @xmath87 and clustering coefficient zero ) or a globally - fully - connected network ( with average degree @xmath88 and clustering coefficient one ) , these two extreme cases are not investigated in the above simulations because , in these two special cases , for a given the average degree value the clustering coefficient can not be adjusted .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] , although the ranking of the convergence is exactly the same as what is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] , the peaks of the curves are similar to each other .",
    "this is because not only the lexicon but also the game rules are identical for all types of underlying networks , namely , if the picked speaker has nothing in his memory then he randomly picks a name from the external lexicon .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] shows the success rate .",
    "it is obvious that when a network has a small clustering coefficient value , its success rate curve is generally smooth .",
    "however , for sw and mlw networks , high clustering coefficient values generate very rough success rate curves . for sw , although rough , the success rate can eventually reach 1.0 ; but for mlw , if the population does not converge as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig7 ] and [ fig : fig8 ] , the success rate can not reach 1.0 .",
    "this is because , in the late stage : 1 ) individuals in intra - communities have already reached convergence , so that the success rate of intra - communication is as high as one , and 2 ) individuals in inter - communities have converged to generally different names , so that the success rate of inter - communication is likely to be as low as zero . as a result , the curves are fluctuating and visually fuzzy .",
    "consider a real - life situation that there are two types of local communities : one located in a suburb of a metropolis ( denoted by @xmath89 ) , and the other is a primitive tribe ( denoted by@xmath90 ) .",
    "the @xmath89 has many connections to the metropolis ( as well as the world outside @xmath89 ) such as road paths , telephone systems and the internet , while an @xmath90 has probably only one trail to go outside without any other communicating connections . within both communities ,",
    "people know each other therefore they have direct communications . considering the above scenario , the first and second experimental studies show that if the size of a community is relatively small , no matter it is an @xmath89 or @xmath90 , information can be easily delivered to each individual within the community , so that they are affected by the outside world ( and finally reach global consensus ) .",
    "however , if the community size is big , a large number of external links are required . otherwise , many individuals can not receive information from outside , and hence the community ( _ e.g. _ , an @xmath90 of large size ) can only reach local convergence , rather than global convergence .",
    "the third experiment shows that , given a fixed number of average degree say five , namely on average each people has five friends to communicate .",
    "if people prefer communicating with local friends , then local communities are formed and so global consensus is hindered .",
    "in contrast , global consensus requires people to have sufficient chance to communicate globally .",
    "in this paper , naming game ( ng ) is implemented by employing the multi - local - world ( mlw ) model , together with three typical topologies , namely random - graph , small - world and scale - free networks , as the underlying framework for communications .",
    "the underlying networks play an important role in ng , which indicate the relationships among different individuals , since connections are the precondition for pair - wise communications . as found in this study ,",
    "community structures are essential for social communications , for which the mlw model used as the underlying network is more practical than the other commonly used network topologies .",
    "the simulation is implemented to study the effects of the number and size of local - worlds in different ng networks , with or without communities , and the results are compared against several key parameters .",
    "simulation results suggest that : 1 ) sufficiently many inter - community connections are crucial for the convergence ; thus , given constant inter - connections , when intra - connections increase , meaning that the inter - connections are relatively weakened , the convergence process will be slowed down and eventually failed ; 2 ) for sufficiently many inter - community connections , both the number and the size of communities do not affect the convergence at all ; and 3 ) given the same average degree for different underlying network topologies , different clustering degrees will distinctively affect the convergence , which also change the shapes of the convergence curves .",
