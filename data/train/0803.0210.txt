    "in this paper we are concerned with the study of solutions of the elliptic problem @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a vector field in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is a scalar function defined on  @xmath0 .",
    "such system arises from the nonstationary navier  stokes equations ( ns ) , for an incompressible viscous fluid filling the whole @xmath0 , when looking for a velocity field @xmath9 and pressure @xmath10 of forward self - similar form : @xmath11 and @xmath12 . an important motivation for studying",
    "the system   is that the corresponding self - similar velocity fields @xmath9 describe the asymptotic behavior at large scales for a wide class of navier  stokes flows .",
    "moreover , simple necessary and sufficient conditions for a solution of the navier  stokes equations to have an asymptotically self - similar profile for large  @xmath13 are available , see @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite , for more explanations and further motivations .",
    "the problem that we address in the present paper is the study of the asymptotic behavior for @xmath14 for a large class of solutions to the system  .",
    "the existence of nontrivial solutions of   has been known for more than sixty years .",
    "for example , in the three - dimensional case landau observed that , putting an additional axi - symmetry condition one can construct , via ordinary differential equations methods , a one - parameter family @xmath15 , smooth outside the origin , and satisfying   in the pointwise sense for @xmath16 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "landau s solutions have the additional property that @xmath17 is a homogeneous vector field of degree  @xmath18 and @xmath8 is homogeneous of degree  @xmath19 , in a such way that the corresponding solution @xmath20 of ( ns ) turns out to be stationary . a uniqueness result by verk , @xcite implies , on the other hand , that no other solution with these properties does exist in @xmath21 , other than landau axi - symmetric ones",
    ". see also  @xcite for a detailed study of the asymptotic properties of these flows .",
    "the class of solutions to the system   is , however , much larger .",
    "indeed , giga and miyakawa @xcite proposed a general method , based on the analysis of the vorticity equation in morrey spaces , for constructing nonstationary self - similar solutions of ( ns ) .",
    "a more direct construction was later proposed by cannone , meyer , planchon @xcite , @xcite , see also  ( * ? ? ?",
    "now we know that to obtain new solutions @xmath17 of   we only have to choose vector fields @xmath3 in @xmath0 , homogeneous of degree @xmath18 , and satisfying some mild smallness and regularity assumption on the sphere @xmath22 : the simplest example in @xmath21 is obtained taking a small @xmath23 and letting @xmath24 but a condition like @xmath25 with small norm ( or similar weaker conditions involving the @xmath26-norm or other besov - type norms on the sphere ) would be enough .",
    "the basic idea is that the cauchy problem for navier  stokes can be solved , through the application of the contraction mapping theorem , in banach spaces made of functions invariant under the natural scaling .",
    "the profile @xmath17 of the self - similar solution @xmath27 obtained in this way ( i.e. @xmath28 ) then solves the elliptic system  .",
    "regularity properties and unicity classes of those ( small ) self - similar solutions have been studied in different functional settings ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) and are now quite well understood .    on the other hand , probably because of the lack of known relations between the self - similar profile  @xmath17 and the datum  @xmath29 , even in the case of self - similar flows emanating from the simplest data , such as in  , the problem of the asymptotic behavior of the solutions @xmath17 obtained in this way has not been addressed , before , in the literature .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to construct an explicit formula relating @xmath4 to @xmath3 , and valid asymptotically for @xmath14 .",
    "we will also consider the more general problem of constructing asymptotic profiles as @xmath30 for ( not necessarily self - similar ) solutions @xmath9 of the navier  stokes equations with slow decay at infinity ( tipically , @xmath31 ) .",
    "our motivation for such generalization is that solutions with such type of decay have , in general , a non - self - similar asymptotic for large time .",
    "in fact , cazenave , dickstein and weissler showed that their large time behavior can be much more chaotic than for the solutions described by planchon @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite , however , one can obtain some understanding on the large time behavior of these solutions from the analysis of their spatial behavior at infinity .",
    "if @xmath32 and @xmath33 are , respectively , a three - order and a two - order tensor in the euclidean space @xmath0 , we denote by @xmath34 the vector field with components @xmath35 sometimes , in the proofs of our decay estimates , we will simply write @xmath36 instead of @xmath34 when all components of such vectors can be bounded by the same quantities .",
    "we denote the gaussian function by @xmath37 as usual , we adopt the semi - group notation @xmath38 for the solution of the heat system @xmath39 , with @xmath40 for an initial datum @xmath29 defined on the whole  @xmath0 .",
    "all the functions we deal with are supposed to be measurable . by definition , for any @xmath41 and @xmath42 ,",
    "@xmath43 we are especially interested in the case @xmath44 .",
    "indeed , the spaces @xmath45 contain homogeneous functions of degree  @xmath18 ( and , in particular , the initial datum @xmath3 given by  ) .",
    "the non - homogeneous counterpart of @xmath46 is the smaller space @xmath47 , which is defined by the additional requirement that @xmath48 for all @xmath49 .",
    "these spaces are equipped with their natural norm : @xmath50    our starting point is a classical result by cannone , meyer and planchon about the construction of self - similar solutions of the navier ",
    "stokes equations @xmath51 even though their construction goes through under very general assumptions on the regularity of the initial data , here we are mainly interested in the following simple result :    [ theocmp ] for all @xmath52 there exist @xmath53 such that for all initial datum @xmath54 homogeneous of degree  @xmath18 , divergence - free and satisfying @xmath55 there exists a unique self - similar solution @xmath56 of the navier  stokes system ( written in the usual integral form , see ( ns ) below ) starting from  @xmath29 , and such that @xmath57 .",
    "moreover , @xmath58    more precisely , cannone , meyer and planchon prove that @xmath59 , where the remainder term satisfies @xmath60 .",
    "their result was stated in dimension three , but their proof easily adapts for all @xmath1 .",
    "our main result shows that one can give a much more precise asymptotic formula between the asymptotic profile @xmath4 and the datum @xmath3 .",
    "it turns out that such asymptotic profile has a different structure in different space dimensions .",
    "[ theoss ] let @xmath3 be a homogeneous datum of degree @xmath18 , such that @xmath29 is smooth on the unit sphere @xmath22 and satisfying the smallness condition   for some @xmath61 .",
    "let @xmath56 the self - similar solution constructed in theorem  [ theocmp ] .",
    "then the following profiles hold :    * if @xmath62 , we have as @xmath14 , @xmath63 here @xmath64 is the @xmath65 matrix given by @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where the @xmath68 are homogeneous polynomials of degree three ( given by the explicit formula   below ) * for @xmath69 , we have as @xmath14 , @xmath70 for a @xmath71 constant real matrix @xmath33 depending on  @xmath29 . here",
    "@xmath72 is the leray - hopf projector onto the divergence - free vector fields . * for @xmath73 , the far - field asymptotics reads , as @xmath14 , @xmath74    in section  [ sec9 ] we will restate and prove this theorem in a more general form , removing the assumption that @xmath29 is homogeneous .",
    "such more general theorem will apply also for solutions @xmath9 of navier  stokes of non - self - similar form . on the other hand",
    ", we will not seek for the greatest generality about the regularity of the datum : even though there is a considerable interest in studying self - similar solutions emanating from rough data ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , in most of our statements we will assume that @xmath75 , which is of course non - optimal , but permits us to greatly simplify the presentation of our results and to better emphasize the main ideas .",
    "the method that we present in this paper would allow to compute , in principle , the asymptotics of @xmath17 up to any order , when @xmath29 is smooth on @xmath22 .",
    "however , the higher order terms have quite complicated expressions .",
    "the functions @xmath76 and @xmath77 appearing in our expansions are both homogeneous of degree @xmath78 and smooth outside the origin . therefore ,",
    "our asymptotic profiles imply that conclusion   of theorem  [ theocmp ] can be improved into @xmath79 and @xmath80 the datum @xmath29 can be replaced here by its filtered version @xmath81 .",
    "it turns out that such improved estimates are optimal for generic self - similar solutions .",
    "for example , in the two dimensional case , the logarithmic factor can not be removed , since the improved bound @xmath82 would require @xmath83 : such stringent condition can be proved to be equivalent to the orthogonality relations @xmath84 and @xmath85 .      we will use the semigroup method and the theory of mild solutions of the navier ",
    "stokes equations as explained in detail in the books @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the main novelty of our approach relies on the use of the following ingredients :    1 .",
    "the first one is the use of remarkable , but not so much known , _ cancellation properties _ hidden inside the kernel @xmath86 of the oseen operator @xmath87 , and inside other related operators , appearing in the integral formulation of navier  stokes .",
    "+ to be more precise , we can write @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is a tensor whose components are homogeneous function of degree  @xmath90 ( namely , second order derivatives of the fundamental solution of the laplacian in  @xmath0 ) , and @xmath91 is exponentially decaying as @xmath14 .",
    "such decomposition already played an important role in our previous work  @xcite , where we showed that solutions @xmath9 _ arising from well - localized data _ behave like @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the energy matrix of the flow : @xmath94 . + a crucial fact in the proof of the results of the present paper",
    "will be the use of the identities , for @xmath95 , @xmath96 such cancellations are somehow hidden in @xmath97 , because the non - homogeneous part @xmath91 ( and , _ a fortiori _ , the kernel @xmath97 ) _ does not have _ a vanishing integral on the sphere .",
    "our second ingredient are _ asymptotic formulae for convolution integrals _ : roughly speaking , these formulae consist in deducing the exact profile as @xmath14 of a convolution product @xmath98 , from information on the regularity , the cancellations , and the behavior at infinity of the two factors  @xmath99 and  @xmath100 . in their simplest form , and for @xmath99 and @xmath100",
    "`` well behaved '' at infinity , those formulae read @xmath101 we will apply several generalizations and variants of   in different situations ( including the case of non - integrable functions ) the factors @xmath99 and @xmath100 being either the oseen kernel , the heat kernel , or a function related to the non - linearity .",
    "the assumptions for the validity of   are quite stringent ( notice that   is obviously wrong if , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath99 and @xmath100 are both a gaussian function ) .",
    "neverthless , the method that we use here has a wide applicability and can be used for constructing the far - field asymptotics for equations of other equations .",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite for an application to a class of convection equations with anomalous diffusion .",
    "we will also make use of the so called _ bi - integral formula_. such formula is obtained by simply iterating the usual integral formulation of the navier ",
    "stokes equations , which we now recall : @xmath102 using the oseen kernel @xmath103 , we can define the navier  stokes bilinear operator as @xmath104 then ( ns ) can be written simply as @xmath105 .",
    "the bi - integral formula is obtained by a straightforward iteration : @xmath106    roughly speaking , combining equation   with some nice properties of the heat kernel and fine decay estimates of the bilinear operator we can prove ( _ e.g. _ when @xmath69 ) that @xmath107 and @xmath108 as @xmath14 . after obtaining an explicit far - field asymptotics for @xmath9 , it is easy to deduce , in the self - similar case , the behavior at infinity of the profile @xmath4 , by passing to self - similar variables and eliminating  @xmath13 .",
    "the two last terms in the above bi - integral formula will contribute to the remaining terms in the right - hand side of expansion  .",
    "notice that , in the two - dimensional case , the term @xmath109 is not well - defined when @xmath29 is homogeneous of degree  @xmath18 .",
    "this explains the different structure of our asymptotic expansions in this case .",
    "the special structure of the asymptotic profiles in the two - dimensional case can be observed also if , instead of considering the behavior for @xmath14 as we do in this paper , one focuses on the the behavior of solutions for large time .",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .    for sake of simplicity ,",
    "in this paper we consider only data such that @xmath110 as @xmath14 , which is the natural assumption for the study of global strong solutions and related self - similarity phenomena .",
    "however , the study of the asymptotic behavior for large  @xmath111 of solutions @xmath27 ( possibly defined only locally in time ) is also of interest in more general situations , such as @xmath112 .",
    "the far - field behavior of the solution @xmath9 of ( ns ) , then mainly depends on the competition between three factors .",
    "the first one is the spatial localization of the datum ( say , the value of the exponent  @xmath113 ) and the consequent space - time decay of the linear evolution @xmath114 .",
    "the other two factors are the action of the quadratic non - linearity @xmath115 and of the non - local operator @xmath116 .    when @xmath117 , the action of this nonlocal operator ( whose kernel behaves at infinity like @xmath118 ) is predominant , and is responsible of _ spatial spreading effects_. when @xmath119 ( the limit case @xmath120 corresponding to the situations in which @xmath115 decays like the kernel ) , the linear evolution becomes predominant and the spatial spreading phenomenon is not directly observed on the solution , but rather on its  _ fluctuation _",
    "we refer to our previous paper  @xcite for a sharp description of these issues .    the asymptotic profiles of @xmath27 as @xmath122 in the cases @xmath123 and @xmath124 should have a slightly different structure , but they are not known with precision yet .",
    "the method that we use in this paper for @xmath44 , and in particular the idea of iterating the duhamel formula making use of the cancellations of the kernels , might be used to compute them .",
    "more and more iterations would be needed to deal with data decaying slower than @xmath125 , or to determine the asymptotics to a higher order . on the other hand ,",
    "no iteration or cancellation property was needed for the faster decaying data studied in  @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : we begin with the study of the oseen kernel . in section  [ sec4 ] , after some generalities about the asymptotic of convolutions , we describe the behavior at large distances of solutions to the heat equation .",
    "section  [ sec5 ] is devoted to the ( more or less standard ) construction of solutions with a prescribed space - time decay . in section  [ section6 ]",
    "we show how to use the cancellations of the oseen kernel to get some new fine estimates . in the remaining part of the paper we will state and prove a more general form of theorem  [ theoss ] .",
    "let @xmath86 be the kernel of @xmath87 , let @xmath127 be the kernel of @xmath128 . both @xmath129 and @xmath130 belong to @xmath131 and",
    "they satisfy the scaling properties @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",

    "@xmath150 and @xmath151 are positive constant , depending on @xmath152 but not on @xmath153 .",

    "the purpose of our next result is to describe the exact behavior as @xmath122 of the convolution product of two functions @xmath99 and @xmath100 from the asymptotic properties of each factor .",
    "we will consider only a simple particular situation that will be sufficient for our purposes .",
