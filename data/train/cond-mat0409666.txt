    "a new site percolation model , directed spiral percolation ( dsp ) , is recently introduced by santra@xcite . the dsp model is constructed imposing both directional and rotational constraints on the ordinary percolation ( op ) model @xcite .",
    "the directional constraint is in a fixed direction in space and the empty sites in that direction are accessible to occupation . due to the rotational constraint",
    "the sites in the forward direction or in a rotational direction , say clockwise , are accessible to occupation .",
    "the direction of the rotational constraint is not fixed in space and it depends on the direction from which the present site is occupied .",
    "percolation under only directional or only rotational constraints have been studied independently and the corresponding models are known as directed percolation ( dp)@xcite and spiral percolation ( sp)@xcite respectively .",
    "it is already known that both dp and sp models belong to different universality classes other than that of op .",
    "the dsp model is essentially a combination of dp and sp models and it is constructed by imposing both the constraints simultaneously in the same model .",
    "recently , the dsp model has been studied on the square lattice in @xmath1 dimensions ( @xmath0)@xcite . it has been found that a new type of percolation cluster is generated in this model .",
    "they are highly rarefied , anisotropic and chiral in nature .",
    "the elongation of the clusters is in a different direction from the imposed directional constraint .",
    "the values of the critical exponents obtained are different from that of the op , dp and sp .",
    "consequently , the dsp model belongs to a new universality class .    in this paper ,",
    "the dsp model is studied on @xmath0 triangular lattice and the results are compared with that of the square lattice data .",
    "the clusters are found more compact and less anisotropic on the triangular lattice than on the square lattice .",
    "most interestingly , it is found that the values of the fractal dimension and some of the critical exponents of the dsp model are considerably different on the square and triangular lattices .",
    "thus , there exists a breakdown of universality in the dsp model when the results of the square and triangular lattices are compared . in the following , the dsp model will be described briefly .",
    "the results of the triangular lattice will be then presented and compared with the square lattice data .",
    "detailed description of the model on the square lattice is given in ref.@xcite .",
    "a brief demonstration will be given here on the triangular lattice .",
    "a left to right directional constraint and a clockwise rotational constraint are imposed on the system defined on a triangular lattice of size @xmath2 . due to the directional constraint an empty site on the right of an occupied site and due to the rotational constraint the empty sites in the forward direction or in the clockwise direction can be occupied . to generate clusters under these two constraints",
    "a single cluster growth algorithm is developed in ref.@xcite following the original algorithm of leath@xcite . in this algorithm",
    ", the central site of the lattice is occupied with unit probability .",
    "all six nearest neighbours of the central site on the triangular lattice can be occupied with equal probability @xmath3 in the first time step .",
    "as soon as a site is occupied , the direction from which it is occupied is assigned to it .",
    "selection of empty nearest neighbour in the next mc time steps is illustrated in fig.[demo ] .",
    "two long arrows from left to right in fig.[demo ] represent the directional constraint .",
    "the presence of the rotational constraint is shown by the encircled dots .",
    "the black circles represent the occupied sites and the open circles represent the empty sites . the direction from which the central site is occupied is represented by a short thick arrow .",
    "now the nearest neighbours of the central occupied site eligible for occupation will be identified .",
    "the dotted arrow indicates the eligible empty site for occupation due to the directional constraint and the thin arrows indicate the eligible empty sites for occupation due to the rotational constraint . since the directional constraint is to the right , site @xmath4 is always eligible for occupation .",
    "the rotational constraint acts in the forward or in the clockwise direction with respect to the direction of approach to the present occupied site . since the central site is approached from @xmath1 , there are three sites , site @xmath5 in the forward direction and sites @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the rotational direction , eligible for occupation due to rotational constraint .",
    "note that , on the square lattice only two empty sites due to the rotational constraint were eligible for occupation at any mc step .",
    "it is also important to note that , in this model an occupied site can be reoccupied from a different direction due to the rotational constraint@xcite .",
    "a site is forbidden for occupation from the same direction . on the triangular lattice , a site",
    "then could be occupied at most @xmath6 times from @xmath6 different directions . due to the reoccupation of occupied sites ,",
    "cluster generation is time consuming in the rotationally constrained models@xcite .    after selecting the eligible sites for occupation",
    ", they are occupied with probability @xmath3 .",
    "the coordinate of an occupied site in a cluster is denoted by @xmath8,@xmath9 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied in both directions and the coordinates of the occupied sites are adjusted accordingly whenever the boundary is crossed . at each time step the span of the cluster in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 directions @xmath12 and @xmath13 are determined .",
    "if @xmath14 or @xmath15 , the system size , then the cluster is considered to be a spanning cluster .",
    "the critical percolation probability @xmath16 is defined as below which there is no spanning cluster and at @xmath17 a spanning cluster appears for the first time in the system .",

    "the cluster size distribution @xmath20 is defined as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the number of @xmath23-sited finite clusters in a total of @xmath24 clusters generated .",

    "the derivative is calculated using the central difference method for the data points collected in an interval of @xmath32 .",
    "an infinite cluster generated on the triangular lattice of size @xmath33 at @xmath34 is shown in fig.[cluster ] .",
    "the black dots are the occupied sites and the solid black circle on the upper left corner is the origin of the cluster . it could be seen that the elongation of the spanning cluster is almost along the left upper to the right lower diagonal of the lattice as it was seen on the square lattice . in the case of charged particles ,",
    "this is due to the development of hall voltage across the sample and perpendicular to the applied in - plane electric field . as a result",
    ", an effective directional field is developed along the left upper to the right lower diagonal of the lattice .",
    "it has already been observed on the square lattice that the dsp clusters are not merely the dp clusters in the presence of the effective field .",
    "the dsp clusters contain features other than the dp clusters .",
    "the clusters here contain holes of almost all possible sizes and it has clockwisely rotated ( chiral ) dangling ends .",

    "vacancies are generated into the cluster as it grows .",
    "at the same time , due to the higher number of branching on the triangular lattice the cluster penetrate into itself more and more than on the square lattice . as a result , the infinite clusters are less rarefied on the triangular lattice than on the square lattice .",

    ", the presence of the directional constraint on top of the rotational constraint might increase the number of spiral lattice trees .",
    "maybe , the higher number of tree like structures in the clusters generated has a non - trivial effect on the critical properties of the dsp model at the percolation threshold and leads to breakdown of universality of the critical exponents .",
