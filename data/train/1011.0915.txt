    "this paper is devoted to the study of some estimates for the helmholtz equation with electromagnetic potential .",
    "a very natural question is to extend the known results for the helmholtz equation with constant coefficients to the case when we consider the perturbed helmholtz equation by a potential .",
    "our goal will be to extend the well known @xmath6-@xmath7 estimates for the free helmholtz equation given in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite to the case when we perturb the equation with an electromagnetic potential .",
    "more precisely , conditions on the electric and the magnetic part of the potential will be given in order to ensure that the estimates remain true .",
    "the @xmath6-@xmath7 estimates for the free helmholtz equation are the following : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a solution of @xmath10 the exponents @xmath11 and @xmath12 in have to verify some specific conditions that will be specified later on . here",
    "@xmath13 can depend on @xmath14 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath15 and is independent of @xmath16 .",
    "the investigation of the estimates started in @xcite , where the study of uniform sobolev estimates for constant coefficient second order differential operators was accomplished . later on , in @xcite , @xcite ( see also @xcite ) the range of the exponents @xmath11 and @xmath12 where the estimates hold was determined .",
    "moreover , in the purely electric case i.e. , for schrdinger hamiltonians of the type @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the electric potential , some positive results were given in @xcite .",
    "therefore the aim of the paper is to prove the corresponding estimates in the case when the electromagnetic schrdinger hamiltonian is considered .    in the first part",
    "we will prove that the existing results for the free helmholtz equation can be extended to the perturbed equation if we impose precise decay conditions at infinity for the electric and the magnetic potential .",
    "this can be done without assuming smallness , neither for the electric part , nor for the magnetic part .",
    "as it will be shown , for the electromagnetic case , the range for the exponents @xmath11 and @xmath12 where the estimates are valid is not the same as the one for the free case , hence in order to go further , we deal with the helmholtz equation with purely electric potential , trying to obtain results in the same region of boundedness of the free equation .",
    "therefore , we consider the electromagnetic schrdinger hamiltonian @xmath5 of the form @xmath19 and the corresponding helmholtz equation in dimensions @xmath0 , namely , @xmath20 here @xmath21 is the magnetic potential and @xmath22 is the electric potential . since now on , we denote by @xmath23 the magnetic potential @xmath24 is a mathematical construction which describes the interaction of particles with an external magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath25 , which is the physically measurable quantity , is given by @xmath26 i.e. it is the anti - symmetric gradient of the vector field @xmath24 ( or , in geometrical terms , the differential @xmath27 of the 1-form which is standardly associated to @xmath24 ) . in dimension",
    "@xmath28 the action of @xmath25 on vectors is identified with the vector field @xmath29 , namely @xmath30 where the cross denotes the vectorial product in @xmath31 .",
    "one of the most interesting facts related to the @xmath6-@xmath7 estimates for the electromagnetic hamiltonian is that it seems that in order to conclude the boundedness of the solution , one should be able to bound the first order term that appears when the hamiltonian @xmath5 is expanded . more concretely , when the term @xmath32 in is expanded , a first orden term , namely @xmath33 , comes out and it is well known that there are no @xmath6-@xmath7 estimates for the gradient of the solution of the free helmholtz equation , @xmath34    we will proceed in the following way .",
    "let us consider the modified helmholtz equation with electromagnetic potential and fixed frequency @xmath35 .",
    "it reads as follows @xmath36    for convenience we will deal only with the case @xmath35 , in contrast with the case of general @xmath37 .",
    "we will prove the corresponding @xmath6-@xmath7 estimates , independent of @xmath16 , for the solution of .",
    "the independence of @xmath16 will imply that the result remains true for the solution of .",
    "this can be seen in @xcite .",
    "our method is a mixture of an a priori estimate and perturbative arguments .",
    "this is what allows us to avoid smallness conditions in the potentials .",
    "similar arguments have been used in the setting of the free schrdinger equation , as can be seen in @xcite and @xcite . along the proof",
    "our basic tools will be the corresponding @xmath6-@xmath7 estimates and a @xmath38-local estimate for the solution of the free helmholtz equation , together with an a priori estimate for the solution of the modified helmholtz equation with electromagnetic potential .",
    "before we describe the results that we are going to use during our proof , let us introduce some basic notation .",
    "for @xmath39 we define the morrey - campanato norm as @xmath40 moreover , we denote , for @xmath41 , the annulus c(j ) by @xmath42 @xmath43 and we easily see the duality relation @xmath44 these norms were introduced by agmon and hrmander in @xcite .    during the exposition , the truncated version of the norms appearing above will be necessary .",
    "we will denote them respectively by    @xmath45    @xmath46    let us also denote by @xmath47 , for @xmath48 , the hilbert space of all functions @xmath49 such that @xmath50 is square integrable over @xmath51 .",
    "the norm in this space is denoted by @xmath52 .",
    "trivially we have that if @xmath53 and @xmath54 , then @xmath55 .",
    "as we have said , part of our method is perturbative , so in order to be able to start , let us remind what is known for the free helmholtz equation .",
    "firstly , we are going to state the result concerning the @xmath6-@xmath7 estimates which appears in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "let be @xmath56 and @xmath57 , the set of points of @xmath58\\times[0,1]$ ] given by @xmath59 ^ 2:\\frac{2}{n+1}\\leq \\frac{1}{p}-\\frac{1}{q}\\leq\\frac{2}{n } , \\frac{1}{p}>\\frac{n+1}{2n } , \\frac{1}{q}<\\frac{n-1}{2n}\\right\\}.\\ ] ]    the set @xmath57 is the trapezium @xmath24@xmath25@xmath60@xmath61 with the closed line segments @xmath62 and @xmath63 removed ( see figure [ fig : deltan ] ) .    , @xmath0 . ]",
    "now , we are in conditions to recall the existing result for the helmholtz equation with constant coefficients .    in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , estimates for the solution of the equation perturbed with generals @xmath37 and @xmath64 , are given , namely , @xmath65 the special case where the point @xmath66 lies on the open segment @xmath67 and on the duality line @xmath68 in figure [ fig : deltan ] was previously obtained in [ @xcite , theorem 2.2 and 2.3 respectively ] .",
    "recall that we will only deal with the case of fixed frequency @xmath35 .",
    "the theorem reads as follows .",
    "[ thm : helmfree ] let u be a solution of @xmath69 then , there exists a constant c , independent of @xmath16 , such that @xmath70 when @xmath71 , @xmath0 .",
    "as we mentioned , another tool that will be crucial in the proof is an @xmath72-local estimate , which bounds the truncated morrey - campanato norm of the solution of the free equation , defined in , in terms of the @xmath3 norm of the rhs data .",
    "this theorem also appears in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the statement is the following .",
    "[ thm : triple]let u be a solution of @xmath73 if    * @xmath28 @xmath74 @xmath75,or * @xmath76 @xmath77 ,    then , there exists a constant @xmath13 , independent of @xmath16 , such that @xmath78    the last result concerns an a priori estimate for the solution of the perturbed equation .",
    "it states that , given precise conditions , without assuming smallness , on the decay at infinity for the the electric potential , the magnetic potential and the radial derivative of the electric potential , we have a precise control for @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "this result appears in @xcite .",
    "the theorem is the following one .",
    "[ thm : apriori ] let @xmath0 , and @xmath81 be a solution of @xmath82 let us assume that :    * [ v ] @xmath83 can be decomposed as @xmath84 , and there exist strictly positive constants @xmath13 and @xmath85 such that * [ v_1 ] @xmath86 * [ v_2 ] @xmath87 * [ b ] @xmath88    choose @xmath89 sufficiently small ( so that @xmath90 , @xmath91 )",
    ". then , there exists a constant @xmath92 , which depends uniformly in @xmath16 , such that the following a priori estimate holds @xmath93    [ rm : singularities ] observe that , since the electric potential @xmath94 and magnetic potential @xmath24 must satisfy the conditions of the theorem , singularities at the origin are not allowed .",
    "notice that the unique continuation property holds for the differential operator @xmath95 , as can be seen in @xcite .",
    "the assumptions @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , together with this observation implies that the limiting absorption principle holds .",
    "the conditions on the decay for the electric potential @xmath94 and the magnetic field @xmath25 given by @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 respectively , are sufficient for us , due we have fixed the frequency @xmath35 .",
    "it can be seen in @xcite , that the result is true provided @xmath14 and @xmath16 belong to the following set denoted by @xmath100 @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 .    hence , the critical case @xmath104 is excluded .",
    "this situation requires more decay for both potentials ( typically @xmath105 , @xmath64 , for @xmath25 and @xmath94 if @xmath28 and @xmath106 for @xmath107 , where @xmath108 ) , in order to obtain a priori estimates for the solution of the perturbed equation , as can be seen in @xcite , where morrey -campanato type estimates , uniform in @xmath16 , are obtained for @xmath109 .",
    "note also that this result gives an a priori estimate without assuming smallness neither for the non repulsive component of the electric field nor for the trapping component of the magnetic field , defined by @xmath110 .",
    "once we have described all the tools which are going to be used , it is necessary to introduce the region where we are able to extend the known results for the free helmholtz equation to the case when electromagnetic perturbations are considered . during the discussion",
    ", it will appear a subregion of @xmath57 , for @xmath0 , which will be denoted by @xmath111 , given by @xmath112 the set @xmath111 is the solid triangle determined by the points @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 ( see figure [ fig : deltan0 ] ) . +",
    "this will be the region of boundedness for the perturbed helmholtz equation .",
    ", @xmath0 . ]",
    "for the case of the perturbed electromagnetic equation we are not able to obtain a positive result of boundedness for the whole region @xmath57 , since we have not control for the gradient term , namely @xmath33 , outside @xmath111 . however ,",
    "when we set @xmath116 , and consider the electric hamiltonian , the results can be extended outside @xmath57 by imposing more decay on @xmath94 .",
    "in this section we will give the precise statement and the proof of the theorem , where we extend the known result for the free helmholtz equation to the case when electromagnetic perturbations are considered . the basic theorems which will be used along the proof were given in the section [ sec : introd ] , as well as the basic notation .",
    "first we will announce the result for the general electromagnetic case and afterwards , by setting @xmath116 , the electric case will be treated by extending our previous result .",
    "let us start by considering the solution of the helmholtz equation with electromagnetic potential that satisfies either the ingoing or the outgoing sommerfeld radiation condition . for @xmath0",
    ", it reads ,          we will prove @xmath6-@xmath7 estimates for the solution of the equation . in order to do that we will consider the solution of as the solution of the modified helmholtz electromagnetic equation , @xmath119 via limiting absorption principle , by taking the limit of the solution of when @xmath16 goes to 0 .",
    "we will obtain the corresponding @xmath6-@xmath7 estimates , independent of @xmath16 , for the solution of , so these will remain true for the solution of .",
    "this is guaranteed by the results appearing in @xcite .",
    "let u be a solution of @xmath121 let @xmath94 and @xmath24 satisfy @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 in theorem [ thm : apriori ] , and suppose that there exist constants @xmath122 such that @xmath123 then , there exists a constant c , independent of @xmath16 , such that @xmath124 when @xmath125 .",
    "notice that there are no smallness assumption neither for the electric potential @xmath94 nor for the magnetic potential @xmath24 .",
    "also we bound the solution only assuming short - range decay for @xmath94 and @xmath24 . as we said in remark [ rm : singularities ] , singularities at the origin for @xmath94 and @xmath24 are not considered",
    ".    * step 1 . *",
    "it will be proved that , whenever @xmath125 then we get the following @xmath126 let @xmath9 be a solution of . since @xmath127 , we can expand the term @xmath128 in the following form @xmath129 this is the key point in order to consider the electromagnetic case as a perturbation of the free equation . as can be seen",
    ", there appear terms of order zero and order one .",
    "so by passing terms to the rhs , we have that @xmath9 is solution of the following equation @xmath130 now we apply the result coming from theorem [ thm : triple ] . by considering the dual estimate of , we get that , if @xmath125 it holds @xmath131 with @xmath13 independent of @xmath16 and @xmath132 defined in .",
    "let us continue with the term @xmath136 .",
    "as before , from , we can treat this term as follows @xmath137 hence , we get @xmath138 the last term is @xmath139 .",
    "similarly , we obtain from @xmath140 so , it verifies @xmath141 from , , and , we get that , whenever @xmath125 , the @xmath4 norm of @xmath9 can be bounded as @xmath142    now we remind the a priori estimate given by theorem [ thm : apriori ] , which ensures that , under the assumptions @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 for @xmath94 and @xmath24 respectively , there exists a constant @xmath13 , such that the following holds @xmath143      so , from and , we get @xmath144 moreover , it holds that @xmath145 can be bounded as @xmath146 this , together with concludes that , if @xmath9 is a solution of , it verifies @xmath147 therefore , we get the desired estimate",
    ".        * step 3 .",
    "* this is the final step in the proof .",
    "as we said in the introduction the main difficulty will be to handle the first order term given by @xmath150 , since there are no @xmath3-@xmath4 estimates for the gradient of the solution of the free helmhotz equation . instead of considering this norm our argument",
    "will end up by treating @xmath79 , and this norm will be under control in the region @xmath111 .    consequently , we have that if @xmath125 , from the @xmath6-@xmath7 estimates for the solution of the free equation , namely , given in theorem [ thm : helmfree ] , and proceeding as in the step 1 for the terms @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 , we get @xmath154 where @xmath13 and @xmath155 do not depend on @xmath16 .",
    "let us remind that , from it holds @xmath156 therefore , we get @xmath157 finally we conclude that if @xmath9 is solution of , by applying we can bound its @xmath4 norm as follows @xmath158 it remains to bound @xmath79 .",
    "this can be done in the following way .",
    "let us consider a radial function @xmath159 .",
    "by multiplying helmholtz equation by @xmath160 in the @xmath72-sense and taking the resulting real parts it gives the identity @xmath161 from this , passing some terms to the rhs and taking modulus , it holds @xmath162          and from , we obtain @xmath168 then , we conclude @xmath169 for the last term , by applying hlder inequality with @xmath170 , we can bound it as @xmath171 where @xmath172 is to be determined . from and we obtain that @xmath173 this leads to the crucial estimate @xmath174 for @xmath175 .",
    "therefore , we have to find the region for @xmath11 and @xmath12 , for @xmath176 , where the following conditions are satisfied @xmath177 we have that holds if @xmath178 , where @xmath179 is given by @xmath180 the region @xmath179 is determined by the points @xmath125 under the diagonal @xmath68 , including the points @xmath181 in the duality line ( see figure [ fig : deltan0med1 ] ) .",
    "finally we have that if @xmath178 , from and it holds @xmath182 for @xmath183 .",
    "this , together with leads to @xmath184 for @xmath178 .",
    "now we choose @xmath185 sufficiently small and conclude for @xmath178 the desired bound @xmath120 finally , by applying duality we have that the result is true for @xmath176 .",
    "the proof is complete .",
    "notice that the region of boundedness for the solution of the helmholtz equation with electromagnetic potential is smaller than the region obtained in the free case .",
    "this is due to the presence of the first order term .",
    "therefore it is natural to consider if , whenever @xmath116 ( i.e. , we deal with the helmholtz equation with electric potential ) , this region can be extended to the whole @xmath57 .",
    "this will be our next aim .",
    "let u be a solution of @xmath186 if @xmath94 satisfies @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 in theorem [ thm : apriori ] , and suppose that there exist constants @xmath187 such that @xmath188 and @xmath189 satisfies for @xmath190 , @xmath191 then , there exists a constant c , independent of @xmath16 , such that @xmath120      [ rm : proof ] as we have seen in theorem [ thm : elecmag ] , whenever @xmath125 , the decay assumption for the electric potential @xmath94 is sufficient ir order to prove the @xmath6-@xmath7 estimates . as we will see , outside this region , more decay for the electric potential @xmath94 potential is needed .",
    "* now let us consider @xmath192 such that @xmath193 .",
    "then from theorem [ thm : helmfree ] and observing that , since the dual estimate of in theorem [ thm : triple ] can not be applied for the perturbative term @xmath153 because we are outside the allowed range for @xmath12 , we conclude that the @xmath4 norm of the solution of the equation can be bounded as follows @xmath194 where @xmath13 does not depend on @xmath16 .",
    "+ here @xmath195 is given by @xmath196 we have taken the point @xmath195 being in the line @xmath197 in order the require the smallest decay for @xmath94 .      finally , from , and reminding that @xmath80 is still bounded for @xmath192 such that @xmath193 , we can conclude the final estimate @xmath120 now , by applying duality we have that the result is true whenever @xmath192 such that @xmath202 .",
    "this ends the proof .",
    "notice that , from , the necessary decay @xmath189 for @xmath94 in order to obtain the result grows as we approach the upper frontier of @xmath57 ( see line segment @xmath62 figure [ fig : deltan0med1 ] ) .",
