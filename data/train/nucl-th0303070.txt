    "[ concl ] .",
    "as first pointed out by bohr and wheeler  @xcite and echoed by aage bohr  @xcite , the relative simplicity and directness of the electromagnetic interaction is very useful in the exploration of the process of nuclear fission . at the first stage of a photonuclear reaction , the absorption of a photon on a pair of intranuclear nucleons brings in only thermal energy and produces fewer changes in the structure of the target nucleus than , for example , reactions induced by protons or antiprotons . in the latter cases ,",
    "the antiproton annihilation removes an intranuclear nucleon , or , respectively , the projectile nucleon can be trapped by the nuclear potential .",
    "therefore , one can expect that following photoabsorption at low energies , most of the fissioning nuclides are similar to the target nucleus .",
    "this makes photofission studies much more transparent .    over the years",
    ", photon - induced fission has attracted attention , and considerable progress has been made in experimental photofission studies . in the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) region , experiments at livermore  @xcite and elsewhere delineated the giant - resonance parameters with high accuracy for eight actinide isotopes ( @xmath12 , @xmath0 , @xmath13 , and the five long - lived uranium isotopes ) . at these low energies ( from threshold to about 20 mev ) , photofission reveals its simplicity , and the total photoabsorption cross section equals the sum of the single- and double - photoneutron cross sections plus the photofission cross section , since the high coulomb barrier greatly inhibits the emission of charged particles .    in the quasideuteron and @xmath14 regions , experiments at saclay  @xcite , mainz  @xcite , and elsewhere extended the photofission data to intermediate energies for @xmath15 and @xmath2 . from a comparison of the photofission cross sections per nucleon for these nuclei with the total photoabsorption cross sections per nucleon obtained by other methods at mainz  @xcite , frascati  @xcite , and bonn  @xcite",
    ", it was commonly believed that there was a `` universal curve '' and that the photofission cross section for these nuclei saturates the total cross section .",
    "the recent precise data from sal  @xcite agree well with the earlier data from saclay and mainz across the upper part of the quasideuteron region ( about 60 mev to the photopion threshold ) and the lower part of the @xmath14 region ( up to about 250 mev ) .",
    "the recent data from jlab  @xcite extend our knowledge of the photofission cross sections for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 across the @xmath14 region and through the higher - resonance region ( from 0.20 to 3.77 gev ) . in this energy domain ,",
    "photonuclear reactions seem to be more complicated .",
    "new advanced theoretical models must be employed to account for the greater number of reaction channels that are open during the first step of the reaction due to meson photoproduction on the intranuclear nucleons .",
    "also , the understanding of the role of nuclear fission among the many other decay modes of the excited nucleus requires a well - founded theoretical model to describe such decay .",
    "one of the first calculations using the intranuclear cascade ( inc ) model that includes photon absorption at intermediate energies was that of ref .",
    "this calculation takes into account the channels of the @xmath16 interaction with production of only one or two pions , and thus can be applied at photon energies only up to 1  gev .",
    "it was tested with old experimental data obtained with bremsstrahlung photons .",
    "later , the model was successfully applied to early photofission studies  @xcite .",
    "inc model predictions  @xcite for the first pre - equilibrium stage of the photofission reaction were also used in fission probability calculations for @xmath2 and @xmath8 nuclei by introducing the mean - compound - nucleus approximation  @xcite . according to this method , the ensemble of excited residual nuclei created after the first step of a photonuclear reaction",
    "is replaced by a single excited nucleus with the average values of neutrons @xmath17 , protons @xmath18 , and excitation energy @xmath19 . in order to explain the data on thorium , one needs to account for its higher nuclear transparency relative to uranium  @xcite .",
    "such a difference for nuclear systems of comparable mass was attributed to subtle details of the nuclear structure of @xmath2 and @xmath8 .",
    "the nature and origin of such differences still need to be explained .",

    "a special phenomenological factor , which selects the quasideuteron absorption that leads to photofission , was introduced and was found to be different for @xmath23 than for @xmath8 .    in refs .",
    "@xcite the photofissility of actinide nuclei at intermediate energies was considered within the multicollisional model for photon - induced intranuclear cascade process and the statistical neutron evaporation and fission models for deexcitation of residual nuclei .",

    "i.e. _ very close , but still less than unity .",
    "however , the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite considered their approach to be accurate only in a restricted range of photon energies , from 0.5 gev to 1 gev .",
    "this makes difficult direct comparison with the sal and jlab data  @xcite , since the data were obtained over a much wider energy range , from 68 mev to 3.77 gev .",
    "recently , the range of applicability of the inc model was extended up to 10  gev  @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the model was improved from the photoneutron thresholds up to 2  gev , and new data obtained with monochromatic photons were used to verify the model predictions . the analysis of photofission reactions performed in the present paper",

    "[ fig : univ_mean ] by the dashed curve , essentially no further modification of the mass or the width of the resonance is required .",

    "[ fig : abs_bw ] , [ fig : univ ] , and [ fig : univ_mean ] that a shoulder appears for @xmath255  0.81.0  gev .",
    "this shoulder might well reflect the excitation of the @xmath256 resonance .",
    "evidence for this @xmath256 excitation is seen most prominently in the structure of the jlab photofission cross sections for @xmath257 and @xmath0 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : abs_bw ] .",
    "we have calculated , using the reldis model , the fission probabilities of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath54 as a function of incident photon energy .",
    "we have used these values , together with the measured photofission cross sections from sal and jlab , to infer the total photoabsorption cross sections for these nuclei .",
    "we now answer the questions raised in sec .",
    "[ sc1 ] .",
    "* we have been able to describe the photofission of the actinide nuclei over a broad energy range .",
    "the calculated fission probabilities for @xmath258 , @xmath8 , @xmath6 , and @xmath5 were found to be stable within 10% with respect to reasonable changes of the input calculational parameters . *",
    "our model calculations show that photonuclear reactions become more complex in the gev energy region , when many reaction channels are open .",
    "contrary to the naive expectation that for the actinides , the higher the photon energy , the closer the fission probability @xmath132 should be to unity , our calculated fission probabilities for @xmath259  gev are found not to exceed those values for @xmath260  mev ; they are , in fact , predicted to decrease somewhat . at higher photon energies ,",
    "only a small part of the energy is converted into the internal excitation of the absorbing nuclear system .",
    "the resulting behavior of @xmath132 is due to the creation of compound nuclei with fissility parameter @xmath92 much lower than that for the target nucleus .",
    "* we show that the residual nuclei after direct and pre - equilibrium emission of hadrons resemble the target nucleus , in the sense that the fissility parameter @xmath92 is similar , only for relatively low incident photon energies ( @xmath261 mev ) .",
    "they differ markedly for gev energies .",
    "the products of photospallation reactions have relatively low probabilities to undergo fission , but high rates to decay via the less collective channels leading to the evaporation of nucleons . *",
    "our calculations show that for the actinides , fission is not the only significant outcome following photoabsorption at gev energies . even at the highest tagged - photon energies ( @xmath262 4  gev ) used in the measurements at jlab ,",
    "the competition with the evaporation process is still important .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the photofission cross section can not be substituted for the total photoabsorption cross section in the gev energy region , even for those nuclei with the largest fissility parameters",
    ". the photoabsorption cross section must be obtained from a calculation of @xmath132 applied to the photofission cross section . * the total photoabsorption cross sections per bound nucleon for @xmath0 and @xmath1 were inferred using the recent photofission data  @xcite and our calculated fission probabilities .",
    "the resulting `` universal '' curves for @xmath235 were found to be in agreement within @xmath230% of each other .",
    "however , reasonable agreement with @xmath235 obtained for nuclei with @xmath24 was found only for @xmath263  gev , while our values for the heavy actinides are @xmath243% higher in the region of the @xmath14 resonance .",
    "* the calculational uncertainties for fission probabilities for np and u are estimated to be at the level of 10% , which should be combined with the @xmath264% accuracy of the measured photofission cross sections .",
    "although the disagreement found with @xmath235 for @xmath24 nuclei can not readily be explained by the presence of these uncertainties , one also should take into account the accuracy of previous measurements of the `` universal curve , '' which can be estimated as no better than 5% as well .",
    "these uncertainties taken together prevent us from drawing a definitive conclusion that the `` universal curve , '' obtained for nuclei with @xmath24 , breaks down for heavy nuclei with @xmath25 and for @xmath53 in the @xmath14-resonance region .",
    "however , our findings clearly call into question this concept and demonstrate the need for direct measurement of the total photoabsorption cross sections for the heavy actinides .",
    "such measurements would serve to confirm or refute the predictions of this paper .",
