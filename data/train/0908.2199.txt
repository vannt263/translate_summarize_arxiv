    "deeply virtual exclusive experiments such as @xmath0 ( deeply virtual compton scattering , dvcs ) and @xmath1 ( deeply virtual meson production , dvmp ) can provide information on the partons localization in space in addition to their longitudinal momentum fraction distribution @xcite . the scattering amplitude for dvcs",
    "can be written within qcd factorization at leading order in @xmath2 as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the four - momentum transfer squared in the hard collision , @xmath5(@xmath6 ) is the initial ( final ) proton momentum , @xmath7 is the four - momentum transfer squared between the initial and final protons , @xmath8 is the skewness variable , and @xmath9 the gpd @xmath10 ( with @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) is the soft part in the handbag diagram describing this reaction , which is convoluted with the hard part , @xmath13 , and integrated over @xmath14 , representing the partons longitudinal momentum fraction . crossing symmetry is implemented by @xmath15 recalling that for pdfs , @xmath16 relates negative @xmath14 to positive @xmath14 antiquark probability .",
    "the goal of this contribution is to determine a physically motivated gpd parametrization that satisfies known theoretical constraints from both elastic and inclusive scattering as well as information from lattice qcd results .",
    "the formulation that we present ultimately aims at :  devising a form combining essential dynamical elements with a flexible model that allows for a fully quantitative analysis constrained by the data \" .",
    "it is a step forward in the direction of current global analyses in related sectors such as the extraction of transverse momentum distributions ( tmds ) from semi - inclusive experimental data @xcite . differently from tmds",
    "however the extraction of gpds is expected to be more challenging due to the large number of kinematical variables and observables to be pinned down in each experimental analysis .",
    "in addition , as illustrated in eq.([direct ] ) , at variance with inclusive and semi - inclusive experiments , the variables representing the quark momentum fraction appear integrated over in the physical amplitudes and can not be accessed directly .",
    "other features also appear that are unique to gpds , and should be taken care of in a physically motivated parametrization , such as @xmath4 evolution ( see _ e.g. _ discussion in @xcite ) , the interplay between flavor separation and crossing symmetry @xcite , the ability to constrain a given gpd from the limited number of available measurements @xcite , and finally the applicability of dispersion relations @xcite .    here",
    "we discuss results obtained using the phenomenologically constrained parametrization from refs.@xcite , and we present further developments of the model .",
    "the parametrization is valid for unpolarized gpds in the valence sector , at intermediate values of the skewness .",
    "it is aimed at having the same kinematical coverage of jefferson lab 6 gev and 12 gev experimental programs .",
    "our formulation is based on a quark - diquark picture improved by a regge - type contribution ( for more details see @xcite :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are respectively the quark - diquark , and regge - type contributions , and we dropped the subscript @xmath20 for simplicity .",
    "note that the parametrization is given in terms of the longitudinal variables @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , which are in a one to one correspondence with the alternative set @xmath23 ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the parametrization is constructed at an initial scale @xmath24 , whose value is determined by our fit to the inclusive and elastic scattering data .",
    "@xmath25 can subsequently be evolved perturbatively @xcite .",
    "experimental constraints can be found by using the fact that @xmath25 obeys the following relations @xcite : @xmath26 @xmath27 being the ( valence ) quark distribution , and @xmath28 the dirac form factor .",
    "clearly , these constraints do not affect the @xmath29 dependence , however additional conditions can be found by using ab initio lattice qcd calculations of the higher moments in @xmath30 ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the @xmath31 moments for both the isovector and isoscalr combinations : @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are in fact available ( moments for the gpd @xmath34 are also available but we will not use them in this contribution ) .",
    "constraints from lattice qcd were used for the first time in ref.@xcite .    by imposing the above constraints it was established in ref.@xcite that the quark - diquark picture can not reproduce data / current parametrizations on @xmath27 at low @xmath30 .",
    "one can in fact expect that the quark - diquark or spectator models where the mass of the spectator is kept at a fixed value does not have the right physical input to reproduce the power dependence in @xmath30 of the data .",
    "the term @xmath35 takes care of this problem effectively .",
    "this in turn allows for a quantitative description of both the low @xmath30 behavior , and of the @xmath36 dependence in the whole range of @xmath36 .",
    "it is important to stress that a correct treatment of the low @xmath30 behavior is crucial in determining the @xmath36 dependence of gpds , even if considering the valence region , because it dominates the form factor sum rule , eq.([ff ] ) .",
    "the latter can not be satisfied without introducing a regge type behavior at low @xmath30 .",
    "this feature is missing from diquark models .",
    "a more thorough study is under way where regge behavior emerges from a spectral distribution in the proton s soft debris invariant mass , @xmath37 , valid at large values of the center of mass energy squared , @xmath38 @xcite .    for the present form of our parametrization we treated separately the so - called dglap ( @xmath39 ) and erbl ( @xmath40 ) regions .",
    "the functional forms for eq.([param1 ] ) in the dglap region are given by    [ param2 ] @xmath41    where @xmath42    @xmath43 in eq.([diq_zeta])@xmath44 and @xmath45 are the initial and final quark momenta respectively , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 being the struck quark mass .",
    "@xmath50 is the nucleon - quark - diquark vertex function , where the diquark is either a scalar or an axial - vector ( this allows us to separate out the @xmath51 and @xmath52 quarks components ) . in eq.([regge ] ) @xmath53 .",
    "notice that the hybrid parametrization does not make use of a `` profile function '' for the parton distributions , but the forward limit , @xmath54 , is enforced non trivially .",
    "this affords us the flexibility that is necessary to model the behavior at @xmath55 .",
    "the parameters in the dglap region were fitted separately : the set @xmath56 was first used to determine the @xmath57 behavior , _",
    "i.e. _ fitted to @xmath58 in the valence region ; next , the set @xmath59 was used to fit to the nucleon form factor data .",
    "all parameters are listed in @xcite .",
    "we reiterate that @xmath24 , the initial scale , is also determined by the fit in our approach .",
    "more importantly , although all parameters are determined in our approach at @xmath60 , the @xmath29 dependence in the dglap region is obtained through the kinematics expressed in eqs.([param2 ] ) .",
    "the values of the parameters obtained for @xmath19 do not correspond directly to similar ones from regge theory because of the multiplicative form in eq.([param1 ] ) that is such that _ e.g. _ the slope at low @xmath30 receives contributions from both the @xmath19 and @xmath18 functions .    to extend a parametrization in the erbl region one needs @xmath29-dependent constraints given _",
    "e.g. _ by the higher moments of gpds that are calculable in _ ab initio _ calculations in lattice qcd .",
    "our study is dedicated to defining and using these constraints .",
    "r0.5        in fig.[fig1 ] we present one sample of our preliminary results from a study performed using the most recently available lattice evaluations from ref.@xcite .",
    "the figure shows @xmath61 points for both the isovector , @xmath62 , and isoscalar , @xmath63 , contributions plotted as a function of @xmath30 at fixed kinematics .",
    "the points where obtained by using a mathematical technique first used in @xcite by which the function @xmath64 is _ reconstructed _ in average ( @xmath65 ) over a given set of points , @xmath66 in the interval @xmath67 $ ] , using a set of normalized polynomials , in this case the bernstein polynomials , as weight functions around @xmath66 ( @xmath29 and @xmath36 are kept fixed ) .",
    "the bernstein moments , or the weighted averages of @xmath25 , are then obtained as linear combinations of @xmath68 which are obtained from the lattice calculations in @xcite .",
    "notice that the latter are moments in the erbl region , obtained by subtracting the dglap region from the total moments given in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the lattice calculations on gpd moments need to be chirally extrapolated . in @xcite we used a phenomenological approach that can be applied to all @xmath31 moments .",
    "the approach makes use of the fact that all moments seem to show a dipole behavior displaying increasing values of the dipole masses , @xmath69 with increasing @xmath70 .",
    "chiral extrapolations for the dipole masses are then implemented . in @xcite",
    "we checked that results were consistent with both data and alternative methods in the case @xmath71 .",
    "here we were able to check that our new results are consistent with the newly available chiral extrapolations for @xmath72 from ref.@xcite .",
    "our consistency check is important for testing the reliability of our method for @xmath61 for which current calculations in chiral perturbation theory are impracticable , while well tested phenomenological approaches like the ones proposed can be used .",
    "the errors on the @xmath14-axis represent the dispersion in our reconstruction technique while the errors on the @xmath73-axis are propagated from the lattice calculation errors .",
    "no other source of errors is taken into account . from fig.[fig1 ] one can see that the isovector contribution is consistent with previous determinations .",
    "one can notice a much improved error bar with respect to our previous analysis in @xcite due to the improved set of lattice results .",
    "furthermore , it is now possible to calculate also the isoscalar contribution .",
    "the dispersion along the the @xmath14-axis could improve if higher @xmath70 moments could be calculated using different lattice qcd techniques that avoid operator mixings and the associated renormalization issues @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , with better constraints in hand , such as the ones displayed in fig.[fig1 ] showing both reduced errors on the isovector part , and for the first time the isoscalar contribution , one can now consider a fully fledged parametrization in the erbl region .    in conclusion , we presented first results on a physically motivated parametrization that takes into account a number of constraints on the gpd h in the valence quarks sector .",
    "similar results were also obtained for the gpd @xmath34 .",
    "parameters along with our statistical analysis are made available .",
    "our work represents a step forward in the much needed direction of global parametrizations of both tmds and gpds .",
    "more comparisons with jefferson lab data on both dvcs and dvmp including the chiral - odd gpd sector @xcite are on their way .",
