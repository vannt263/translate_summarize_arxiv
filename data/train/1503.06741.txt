    "the epoch at redshift @xmath8 marks the peak of quasar formation @xcite as well as the reionization of the intergalactic helium ( * ? ? ?",

    "as the reionization of singly ionized helium requires high - energy photons above 4 rydberg , the hard uv background radiation field in the vast intergalactic space , commonly referred to as `` metagalactic '' , at @xmath0 is believed to be photons originating from quasars instead of hot stars @xcite . because helium is difficult to ionize and readily recombines , its opacity at this redshift range is considerably higher than that of hydrogen .",
    "most of our knowledge of the intergalactic helium at these high redshifts is based upon a few bright quasars with clear lines of sight : qso0302@xmath9003 @xcite , hs1700 + 6416 @xcite and he2347@xmath94342 @xcite .",
    "thanks to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",

    "the highest redshift is 3.93 @xcite .",
    "the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) instrument aboard the _ hst _  has greatly enhanced our ability to probe multiple lines of sight and investigate the  absorption features at higher signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios . in the five years since the cos installation , more than two dozen quasars",
    "have been confirmed with the  ly  @xmath1  features .",
    "the ensemble of spectra of these quasars is now sufficiently large that we can begin to overcome the cosmic variance and investigate the reionization process over a significant range of redshift .",
    "it is now well established that the gunn - peterson effect @xcite in quasar spectra becomes significant only at @xmath10 for @xcite and at @xmath11 for   @xcite , signaling the end of the respective reionization epochs .",
    "the intergalactic - medium ( igm ) reionization process is lengthy , and little is known about the igm evolution at much higher redshifts , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath12 for helium , @xmath13 for hydrogen .    the ionization properties of the igm change significantly near luminous quasars , whose radiation enhances the ionization level in their vicinity .",
    "this `` proximity effect '' was first found in quasars at @xmath0 where the number of  ly  @xmath1  forest lines in their optical spectra declines in the quasar vicinity @xcite . at a high igm opacity , the proximity effect results in an expected residual flux blueward of the  ly  @xmath1  wavelength @xcite .",
    "such an absorption profile has been observed in the  spectra of most quasars at @xmath14 @xcite . for helium ,",

    "the  ly  @xmath1  absorption troughs may be complex @xcite , as their shapes are affected by several factors : a proximity profile blueward of the  ly  @xmath1  wavelength , a damped absorption profile that extends to the wavelengths redward of it , and possibly another damped absorption profile from an associated absorber . in this paper",
    ", we report our analysis of the proximity effect using a large sample of quasars with confirmed  ly  @xmath1  features .",

    "the spectrum of sdss1319 + 5202 reveals a lyman - limit system ( lls ) at @xmath23 ( @xmath24    in the observed frame ) , and the source flux below 1550    is considerably suppressed . based on low - resolution prism data ( @xmath25 at 1460  ) , we suggested an associated damped absorption system whose effect extends redward of the  ly  @xmath1  wavelength @xcite . with the improved wavelength accuracy of our higher - resolution cos spectrum ,",
    "the absorption profile is confirmed to straddle the  ly  @xmath1  wavelength and can not be explained by a simple proximity profile .",
    "the cos spectra of these four quasars are shown in figure [ fig - cos ] .    to study the absorption profiles , it is essential to accurately determine the quasar systemic redshifts .",

    "a power - law continuum , and a  ly  @xmath1   emission line were used to fit the data in wavelength redward of the  ly  @xmath1  break . for the optical spectra ,",
    "we used a power - law continuum , multiple emission lines , including ly  @xmath1  ( narrow + broad ) , , , , , @xcite , and a set of absorption templates that simulate the accumulated igm absorption and the proximity profiles .",
    "the systemic redshifts were verified using the @xmath26 emission line as low - ionization lines are believed to be less affected by the local motion of broad - line regions . for our sample ,",
    "the redshifts are generally consistent with those in the sdss data release seven quasars catalog ( dr7 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , except for sdss2346@xmath90016 .",
    "we obtained a spectrum of sdss2346@xmath90016 using the triplespec instrument @xcite on the arc ( the astrophysical research consortium ) 3.5-m telescope .",
    "the observations were made on 2011 november 10 and 16 , under an ambient temperature of 1 - 3 c , and the total integration time was 10 hours .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig - nir ] , the [ ]  @xmath275007 emission is not visible .",
    "the and h@xmath28 emission lines , while unusually weak , yield a redshift consistent with the line .",
    "the cos spectra are of sufficient spectral resolution to confirm that that our measurements of the proximity profile are not affected noticeably by the small difference in quasar redshifts .",
    "we retrieved the archival cos / g140l spectra of 15 other quasars ( go 11742 and 13013 ) via the mikulski archive for space telescopes and processed with the standard pipeline calcos ( * ? ? ?",
    "* v2.19 ) .",
    "the difference between the pipeline extraction and our narrow - window extraction ( see  [ sub_cos ] ) is mainly in the residual flux level at wavelengths far away from the quasar , but this difference has no effect to our study . for qso0233@xmath90149 ,",
    "the geocoronal @xmath19 line is close to the  ly  @xmath1   wavelength , therefore we used the orbital - night portion of the data .",
    "we also used the night portion of the qso0916 + 2405 data as geocoronal @xmath29 emission is near its  proximity profile .",
    "four of these quasars were excluded because of severe contamination by geocoronal emission .",
    "four more were excluded as the flux breaks in their spectra are observed at wavelengths considerably longer than that for  ly  @xmath1 .",
    "most likely , these are attributed to partial  llss along the lines of sight .",

    "figure  [ fig - cos2 ] plots the spectra of seven quasars that we include in our sample , with contaminating lines flagged with the earth symbols .",
    "a number of the cos spectra of  quasars have been published @xcite , most of which were observed with the g140l grating .",
    "we estimated the proximity sizes in the literature .",
    "for most of them , their systemic redshifts are from the sdss catalog .",
    "the references for their redshifts are listed in tables 3 and 4 .",
    "one stis spectrum of quasar pks1935@xmath9692 is used .",
    "the study of  proximity profiles is more challenging than that of  at @xmath30 as they are more complex .",
    "we measured a proximity zone from the  ly  @xmath1  wavelength to a point where the flux drops to below propagated errors as calculated in a bin of approximately 1.5  .",
    "we used these nominal bin sizes and combined the redshift errors to estimate the uncertainties in zone sizes .",
    "a difference of 1.5   corresponds to a redshift difference of 0.005 for  ly  @xmath1 .",
    "this definition of proximity zones is based on an assumption of zero continuum flux beyond a proximity zone , as implied by the high  opacity at @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "an exception is the quasar hs1700 + 6416 ( @xmath32 ) , where the continuum flux level blueward of the  ly  @xmath1  wavelength is known to be nonzero . in figure 8 of @xcite , the  ly  @xmath1  absorption region",
    "is plotted along with a keck / hires spectrum .",
    "we estimated the flux level in two regions where no strong  absorption is present : @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the average  ly  @xmath1opacity there was estimated as @xmath35 . extrapolating this value to @xmath36 using a theoretical scaling relation @xmath37 @xcite ,",
    "the normalized flux level there should be 0.36 ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "this is approximately the flux level around @xmath39 and 2.739 , where no strong  absorption features are present , and a potential flux excess near these two redshifts is marginal at best .",
    "it is likely that the proximity zone in hs1700 + 6416 ends at the absorption feature of @xmath40 .",
    "a generous estimate would mark the zone down to @xmath41 , where there is no significant  absorption line .",
    "we therefore list the zone size as @xmath42 mpc in table [ tbl-3 ] , to reflect the two possible values of 2 and 6 mpc and other uncertainties .",
    "all broad proximity profiles are embedded with strong absorption features . at a relatively high flux , these discrete absorption lines can be easily identified . however , at a low - flux end , they may cut off the residual flux and cause an underestimate of the proximity zone size . when an optical spectrum is available , we checked whether a strong  absorption line is present near the wavelength that corresponds to the  proximity zone s endpoint . in six cases in tables [ tbl-2 ] and [ tbl-3 ] ,",
    "no such a  absorber is identified within 6   of the endpoint s wavelength in optical spectra ( @xmath43 ) . in the other 11 cases",
    "such  absorption features are found near the proximity - zone endpoint , and for the other seven quasars no optical spectra are available .",
    "therefore the possibility is real that their proximity zones may be underestimated . in these 18 cases we increased the measurement errors by adding a term of 3 mpc ( @xmath44 at @xmath45 ) , approximately the nominal width of a strong absorption feature in g140l spectra .",
    "the quasar he2347@xmath94342 does not show a proximity zone , and there is no absorption feature in the uves spectrum near the systemic redshift that can account for a potential  lls .      given the sample size",
    ", it would be informative to study the evolution of  proximity zones with redshift and luminosity , which has been reported for  at @xmath30 (  [ sub_comp ] ) .",
    "we plot the distribution of proximity - zone sizes over redshift and luminosity , respectively , in figures [ fig - z ] and [ fig - lum ] .",
    "the redshift scales in the top and bottom panels of figure [ fig - z ] are set to reflect the same ratio of cosmic time .",
    "our results demonstrate that the proximity effect is common among  quasars , and their proximity - zone sizes can be considerably larger than those in the  quasars at @xmath3 . the most significant trend seems to be at @xmath4 , where the zone size decreases towards higher redshift .",
    "this trend may be understood in terms of an increasing  fraction and signals the onset of the intergalactic  reionization .",
    "the two most luminous quasars , hs1700 + 6416 and he2347@xmath94342 , are located at lower left in the top panel of figure [ fig - lum ] and clearly disconnected from the rest of the sample .",
    "recently a bright quasar at @xmath46 was discovered @xcite : with a similar luminosity and a moderate zone size , this quasar is also at odds with the model prediction that luminous quasars display a larger proximity zone .",
    "we ran statistical tests to check potential correlations .",
    "the tool is the iraf astronomical survival analysis package , which allows upper or lower limits as inputs @xcite .",
    "a moderate anti - correlation between zone sizes and quasar redshifts is confirmed : the spearman correlation coefficient @xmath47 , rejecting a no - correlation hypothesis at 99% level .",
    "proximity - zone sizes do not appear to be correlated with quasar luminosities : the spearman correlation coefficient between them is @xmath48 , suggesting a 65% probability for no correlation . even without the two data points at the high - luminosity end ,",
    "the correlation is still poor .",
    "a major source of uncertainties in our measurements of proximity zones is the systemic redshifts of quasars .",
    "the sdss quasars have redshift uncertainties on the order of @xmath49 @xcite , which are derived mainly at @xmath50 when narrow emission lines are present .",
    "we verified the redshifts of sdss quasars in our sample with @xmath51emission in the optical spectra .",
    "emission is a weak feature and consists of multiple components , which carry a statistically weighted average of 1303.49    @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath51  emission may be blended with @xmath52 @xcite . assuming a solar abundance , the weighted average for + is 1304.22   .",
    "we adopted this value with an uncertainty of 1   , which is comparable to the statistical errors of 5   ( in the observer s frame ) in our fitting to the sdss spectra . combining these terms and converting into the observer s frame for  ly  @xmath1 , we estimated uncertainties of approximately 2    in the uv spectra of our sample .",
    "this term corresponds to @xmath53 , 450 @xmath54  in velocity dispersion , and 1.2 mpc in proper distance at @xmath45 .",
    "we verified the redshifts of sdss quasars using fits to @xmath51  emission when possible . in a number of cases ,",
    "@xmath51  emission is too weak to be useful in redshift estimates , we then used the redshift values from dr7 . for the non - sdss quasars in tables [ tbl-2 ] and [ tbl-3 ]",
    ", we assumed a redshift error of @xmath55 @xmath54  in velocity space , unless quoted explicitly .",
    "another source of uncertainties in our estimates of the proximity - zone sizes arises from their ending points in the low - flux regions .",
    "our data are mainly moderate - resolution spectra with limited s / n levels . for the cos g140l data ,",
    "this nominal uncertainty is 1.5   , which corresponds to approximately 0.9 mpc in proper distance at @xmath45 and 1.1 mpc at @xmath56 . as discussed in  [ sub_res ] , the frequent occurrence of strong absorption features ( column density @xmath57 @xmath58 ) adds a term of uncertainty in many cases",
    ".    other rare effects , such as an infalling absorber could affect the redshifts , but are unlikely to be thick enough to account for the lack of a proximity effect @xcite .",
    "quasar spectra display the signature of numerous igm components , and density fluctuations have a significant impact on the  ionization process .",
    "llss of column density @xmath59  @xmath58 , both in  and low redshift and  at high , produce random flux cutoffs . at @xmath60 ,",
    "a  lls may mimic a  absorption edge .",
    "the probability of encountering such a system per unit redshift is @xmath61 @xcite , which yields a rate that is consistent with other results @xcite . over a wavelength range of 15    ( @xmath62  mpc in proper distance ) near  ly  @xmath1",
    ", there is less than 2% probability of intercepting a  lls of optical depth @xmath63",
    ". this value would be even smaller if we consider this effect only in the region near the proximity - zone s endpoint .      for",

    "a simple estimate @xcite suggests that a system becomes opaque ( @xmath65 ) to the ionizing photons at 4 rydberg if its  column density @xmath66 @xmath58 . based on the high - resolution data at @xmath67 @xcite ,",

    ", the mean @xmath68 value may be around 200 @xcite .",
    "however , very high @xmath68 values are mostly associated weak lines and very difficult to confirm , particularly at @xmath71 when the  opacity is high .",

    "this recent analysis is based on g140l data , while the previous studies used high - resolution fuse data . to check the reality of low @xmath68 at @xmath82 , we used the published results of qso0302@xmath9003 at a higher redshift",
    ". @xcite used a high - resolution keck spectrum and cos / g130 m spectrum to derive @xmath68 values with a bin size of @xmath83 . in the range of @xmath84",
    "there are 21  absorption lines at @xmath85  @xmath58   @xcite . at @xmath86 and @xmath87",
    "there are additional eight absorption lines with restframe equivalent widths greater than 0.3  . from figures 10 - 13 of @xcite we estimated 29 @xmath68 values",

    "we analyzed the sdss spectra of our sample and identified 40 strong  absorption features in the proximity zones : nearly all see a significant flux at their blueward wavelengths . if the @xmath68 values are around 100 for these absorbers , they should display a sharp flux cutoff .",
    "furthermore , in the sdss spectra of five quasars , no strong  absorbers are found near the wavelengths that correspond to a proximity - zone endpoint ( tables [ tbl-2 ] and [ tbl-3 ] ) . the upper limit to the  column density would be approximately @xmath89 @xmath58 , assuming a minimum equivalent width of 0.3   in the restframe and a nominal velocity dispersion of 30 @xmath54 .",
    "if an endpoint of the proximity profiles in these quasars is attributed to an assumed  lls , the @xmath68 value may be 8000 or higher , which is not supported by observations .",
    "we therefore conclude that , while such a possibility can not be ruled out , it is unlikely that proximity profiles are significantly altered by dense  lls .",

    "the value given in equation ( 1 ) is an upper limit ; real ionized zones are considerably smaller for at least two reasons .",
    "first , this hypothetical limiting radius grows faster than the ionization front expands due to the decreasing igm density as the universe expands @xcite .",
    "secondly , for intergalactic helium , the recombination time scale is so long , @xmath102 gyr , that it exceeds the nominal quasar ages . as a result ,",
    "the igm around quasars would not reach a balance to form a strmgren zone . if the gas is denser than average ( @xmath103 ) or clumpy , and if the quasar age is old , the recombination rate may become comparable to the ionization rate .",
    "a proximity zone does not mean that a strmgren sphere has been established , in the sense of numbers of recombinations balancing numbers of ionizations .",
    "this calculation could just indicate that the gas within the sphere is over - ionized by the presence of the quasar radiation compared with that in the general igm .",
    "the timing criterion for the ionization fraction to stay in ionization balance is only that the age be longer than ( ionization rate)@xmath104 for highly ionized gas ( m09 ) .",
    "assuming an average igm density , the opacity is estimated to be on the order of @xmath105^{3/2}$ ] for hydrogen and @xmath106^{3/2}$ ] for  @xcite .",

    "this effect should apply to  @xcite as well as  @xcite absorption .",
    "however , the overall  optical depth could be as high as @xmath110 if the intergalactic helium is in a form of singly ionized state and remains poorly constrained at @xmath111 .    in the wavelength region",
    "1325 - 1340   ( @xmath112 ) of the spectrum of sdss1253 + 6817 , the effective optical depth is @xmath113 at 95% confidence level . if we used a wider slit width as the calcos pipeline default , @xmath114 at 68% confidence level , or @xmath115 at 95% level .",
    "it is therefore possible that the flux extends beyond 12 mpc from the quasar , suggesting that the metagalactic -ionizing radiation field is extremely weak but present , or the quasar has a -ionizing luminosity considerably stronger than the extrapolation from a nominal power law , or the ionization level has not yet recovered after an earlier episode of an enhanced quasar luminosity .",
    "the proximity profile is subject to the quasar age .",
    "a large zone size requires sufficient ionizing photons from the quasar , even after a long period , if the surrounding intergalactic helium was not fully ionized , and a large number of photons are needed to ionize it . for a young quasar ,",
    "the proximity profile would display a sharp cutoff .",
    "several factors affect the proximity profile : ( 1 ) the igm density and its fluctuations ; ( 2 ) the quasar luminosity ; ( 3 ) the quasar age ; and ( 4 ) the recombination process . for the case when the quasar age is considerably smaller then the recombination time scale , the total number of -ionizing photons over a lifetime @xmath116 is equal to that of the ionized helium atoms in the quasar vicinity :    @xmath117    we used the proximity profile in sdss1253 + 6817  to model the evolution of intergalactic helium .",
    "while other cases of significant proximity effect exist , the profiles are often shelf - like , possibly due to the duty cycle of the quasar or the transverse proximity effect by other quasars @xcite .",
    "the g140l spectrum , after a reddening correction of @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and the extinction curve of @xcite , displays a threefold increase in flux from 1950 to 1400  , which is steeper than that in qso0302@xmath9003 .",
    "since no lls break is obvious in this wavelength range , we fitted the dereddened continuum between 1400 and 1900   with a simple power law and a potential partial lls between 2000 and 3000  .",
    "the best fit suggests @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) and a lls of @xmath122 at @xmath123  . if no lls is assumed , the best - fit power law has @xmath124 .",
    "both fitting results suggest a similar continuum level of @xmath125 @xmath21at the  lyman - limit wavelength of @xmath126  . the estimated total photon rate at 4 rydberg is @xmath127  sec@xmath104 .",
    "as shown in the next section , this hard continuum is not strong enough to produce the observed broad proximity profile if the intergalactic helium is not fully ionized .      the ionized zones represented by equations ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) are extreme cases ; the real ionization by a quasar is a gradual and slower process , which can be described by an analytical expression derived from a simplified differential equation @xcite for a fixed igm temperature .",
    "a more accurate evaluation of the ionization fraction requires simultaneously solving for the gas temperature and the ionization .",
    "we computed the time dependence of  ionization around a quasar , as outlined in m09 .",
    "specifically , we solved the time - dependent spherically symmetric set of coupled ionization rate equations for uniformly distributed hydrogen and helium ( equations 41 and 46 of m09 ) on a radial grid , including the photoelectric attenuation by , he  i and  of the radiation from the quasar .",
    "we solved these equations simultaneously with the photoionization heating and cooling equations as described in m09 ( sec.iii.b ) for a pure hydrogen / helium gas of cosmic abundances .",
    "this calculation used the atomic rates in m09 , except for adopting the electron excitation and ionization cooling rate of  from @xcite .",
    "our calculations assumed case a recombination and included compton cooling off the cosmic microwave background and adiabatic expansion losses in the gas .",
    "we considered a sequence of quasar activation redshifts corresponding to -region ages at @xmath128 of 10 , 20 , 30 , 50 , and 100 myr . to match the observed proximity profile",
    ", the -ionizing continuum must be very strong : @xmath129 at 228   in the restframe , which is approximately three times of the estimated level from observations .",
    "it would imply an euv continuum that is even steeper than qso0302@xmath9003 @xcite .",
    "lower - luminosity models , such as a -ionizing continuum extrapolated from the flux at  ly  @xmath1  wavelength with a nominal power - law index of @xmath130 @xcite were not able to match the size of the ionized region and the flux simultaneously . we emphasize that the measured absorption signal is co - temporaneous with the quasar observed .",
    "since the characteristic time to reionize the gas and maintain ionization equilibrium is on the order of millions to tens of millions of years , depending on the distance from the quasar , the luminosity of the quasar that produced the proximity zone may have been larger than the observed value ; we have few constraints on quasar variability on million year timescales .",
    "we estimated the black - hole mass as @xmath131 , using the line width , the underlying continuum flux in the sdss spectrum and the formula in @xcite . following the work of @xcite",
    ", we derived the rest - frame luminosity near the lyman limit as @xmath132 @xmath133 , which is below the eddington limit of @xmath134 @xmath133 . a -ionizing metagalactic background was not assumed . in our simulations of the ionization zone",
    ", a hydrogen - ionizing and he  i - ionizing metagalactic background was turned on at @xmath135 .",

    ", a sharp ionization front expands over time , as described by equation ( 3 ) . at each radius and each time interval ,",
    "the temperature is computed from the energy equation and used to evaluate the atomic rates .",
    "helium within the sphere is highly ionized , as the ionizing flux is strong and recombination is not effective . at later epochs ,",
    "when the ionization front reaches large distances , ionization balance between the geometrically - diluted quasar ionization flux and recombinations produces a more gradual rise in the  fraction with distance . as shown in figure [ fig - time ] , a smooth decline of flux may be observed after @xmath136 myr .",
    "the high luminosity assumed in this simulation and that in equation ( 3 ) probably represents an upper limit as high - energy photons from the quasar need to ionize a large volume of singly ionized helium .",
    "this requirement would be eased if a -ionizing background field existed prior to @xmath137 .",
    "as equation ( [ eq : time ] ) shows , the ionizing luminosity may be reduced by a factor of three to @xmath138 sec@xmath104 if the  fraction @xmath108 is 30% . in either case ,",
    "the ionization front is likely moving nearly at the speed of light , as shown in figure [ fig - time ] .",

    "adapting their equations to , the speed - of - light corrections are important to the observed size until times large compared with @xmath139  myr for an assumed boosted quasar  ionizing photon luminosity of @xmath140 , where @xmath141 .",
    "the observed ionization zone sizes then increase slowly with time , as @xmath142 .",
    "after an expansion time of 50  myr , the ionization front in figure [ fig - time ] is restricted by the speed of light , but the ionization front velocity slows to 0.5c by 100  myr . according to equation ( 3 ) , the age of the observed quasar producing the ionization zone after an expansion time of 50  myr is @xmath143  myr , which provides a minimal age to the quasar .",
    "if the igm were highly clumped , the  region would expand more slowly , as recombinations would slow it down .",
    "the high quasar luminosity used in figure  [ fig - time ] is required to match both the position of the ionization front and the  ly  @xmath1  flux level behind the front assuming a homogeneous igm . if instead the igm opacity is dominated by line - blanketing by the ly  @xmath1  forest , the quasar luminosity need not be so high to match the flux level while still matching the position of the  front .",
    "this would , however , require a somewhat older quasar .",
    "the model in figure  [ fig - time ] demonstrates the extreme assumptions that must be made for the quasar spectrum to match both the flux level and the position of the  front assuming a homogeneous igm .",
    "line - blanketing by the  ly  @xmath1  forest is a more plausible explanation for the flux level @xcite .      in principle",
    ", a proximity profile should be present in every  quasar spectrum , as a cosmic `` bubble '' would exist even without a metagalactic radiation field . at the beginning",
    ", ionizing photons do not travel very far , as the mean free path @xmath144 is less than 0.1 mpc , where @xmath145 @xmath146 is the photoionization cross section at 4 rydberg and @xmath147 @xmath148 the number density of singly ionized helium at @xmath149 , is less than 0.1 mpc .",

    "the uv spectroscopic properties of hs1700 + 6416 ( @xmath32 , v=16.2 ) have been extensively studied @xcite .",

    "blueward of the break , a shelf of residual flux corresponding to an opacity @xmath153 extends out about 15  .",
    "the recent cos observations @xcite provide details in the proximity zone .",
    "the broad proximity profile , extending up to 15 mpc , may be attributed to a line - of - sight effect from the quasar itself , or to a transverse effect by another quasar q0301@xmath900 ( @xmath154 ) near the line of sight . in the latter case",
    ", the age of the ionization zone around q0301@xmath900 should be at least 34 myr .",
    "it is interesting to note that the -ionizing continuum is considerably harder ( power - law index @xmath155 ) than previous work suggested : broad proximity profiles appear to be related to a hard quasar continuum .",

    "this trend is similar to what is observed for helium at @xmath0 , and it is instructive to compare these two major cosmic processes .",
    "the number of -ionizing photons of a quasar is considerably higher than that of -ionizing photons . on the other hand ,",
    "the igm at @xmath30 is denser than that at @xmath157 .",
    "the recombination time scale of hydrogen is lower than helium . as a result of these factors ,",
    "our estimate based on equation ( 1 ) suggests that the proximity profile of intergalactic hydrogen at @xmath3 is somewhat weaker than that for  at @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite reported proximity profiles of hydrogen in the spectra of 27 quasars ; their `` near zones '' ( proximity ) lie in the range of @xmath158 mpc .",
    "they found a significant trend for a decrease in the near - zone size with increasing redshift , as evidence for the evolution of an increasing neutral fraction of intergalactic hydrogen toward higher redshifts .",
    "they also found that the near - zone sizes increase with the quasar uv luminosity , as expected for photoionization dominated by quasar radiation .",
    "we add eight more data points from recent literature .",
    "one quasar is at the highest known redshift @xmath159 @xcite and another is luminous ( @xmath160 , * ? ? ?",
    "these two data points carry a significant weight in the correlation analysis .",
    "the paper of @xcite does not list the near - zone sizes , and we made estimates from their figure 4 .",
    "a spearman test over these 35 data points finds a correlation coefficient @xmath161 between zone sizes and redshifts , rejecting a no - correlation hypothesis at 99.95% level .",
    "another test between zone sizes and absolute magnitude finds @xmath162 , rejecting a no - correlation hypothesis at 99.4% level .",
    "the luminous quasar j0100 + 2802 displays a proximity zone of 8 mpc .",
    "while this is a significant size , it does not scale well to luminosity ( see the lower panel of figure [ fig - lum ] ) .",
    "its normalized zone size , @xmath163 at the restframe wavelength of 1450  , is 4 mpc , below the average at the absolute magnitude @xmath164 .",
    "this result is actually consistent with the two luminous  quasars that they do not show a significant proximity profile .",
    "maybe some other factors , such as the density and ionization level in the quasar s vicinity or a young quasar age , play an important role .",
    "we utilize a sample of 24  quasars to investigate the interplay between these quasars and the surrounding igm .",
    "the ionization zone around  quasars is often more prominent than that for  at @xmath3 .",
    "the large redshift range for these quasars allows us to gain insight into the igm reionization over a long epoch before intergalactic helium became fully ionized .",
    "the proximity - zone sizes decline significantly at @xmath4 , and it is likely that helium reionization started well before @xmath165 .    in the quasar sdss1253 + 6817 , the source flux extends considerably blueward of the  ly  @xmath1   wavelength , suggesting a quasar age of @xmath166 myr .",
    "the uv flux rises dramatically from 1950 to 1400  , suggesting an exceptionally hard euv continuum .",
    "the @xmath68 value in the proximity zone is lower , consistent with such strong -ionizing radiation from the quasar that produces a broad proximity zone .",
    "the two brightest quasars do not display a significant  proximity profile . while this is at odds with model expectations ,",
    "we notice that a luminous quasar does not display the largest  proximity profile either .",
    "it is possible that these hyperluminous quasars are young , or they are surrounded by a dense igm .",
    "it should be stressed that the observed proximity - zone size is not a direct measurement of the quasar lifetime , as the structure of the zone is affected by many possible factors , including the igm density fluctuations and quasar variability over igm ionization timescales .",
    "a quasar with small proximity zone may be considerably younger compared with the light - travel time across its proximity zone allowing for retardation effects .",

    "the proximity profiles in the prism data are consistent with that in the cos / g140l data : sdss1253 + 6817  displays a broad profile and sdss2346@xmath90016 does not .",
    "most of the acs prism data yielded no detection of proximity profiles ( @xmath174  mpc ) . in table",
    "[ tbl-4 ] we list three quasars whose proximity profiles in the acs prism spectra are larger than 7  .",
    "they are at relatively high redshifts , and the data suggest that the decline of proximity - zone size may start at @xmath175 .        the study of the proximity effect has been based on high - resolution quasar spectra @xcite , where the numbers of forest lines are compared in the quasar s vicinity and at large distances .",
    "the effect of enhanced radiation in a quasar s vicinity may be seen even at a low spectra resolution .",
    "@xcite used a flux transmission technique on the vlt / fors2 spectra ( @xmath176 ) of 17 bright quasars at @xmath177 to measure the effective optical depth along the lines of sight and detect a proximity effect .    the effective optical depth accumulated from most igm components",
    "is estimated as @xmath178 @xcite .",
    "approximately half of this term is from those at column density @xmath85 @xmath58 , most of which cases can be identified at the sdss spectral resolution and s / n (  [ sub_res ] ) . from a power - law distribution of @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the column density and @xmath181 the number of individual absorbers @xcite , we estimated approximately six strong absorbers over a range of 10 mpc ( @xmath182   on the sdss wavelength scale ) .",
    "these lines affect roughly 60% of the pixels in this bin , assuming that each line affects five sdss spectral pixels .",
    "the fluxes in other pixels in this bin are believed to bear the signature of weak igm components .",
    "since these lines are unsaturated , their intensity is sensitive to the proximity effect . by measuring the flux decrements in these pixels",
    ", we tried to detect the signature of proximity zones .",
    "we generated a set of absorption templates @xmath183 , where r is the distance to the quasar and @xmath184 the proximity size .",
    "the range of @xmath184 is 5@xmath935 mpc .",
    "the fitting task specfit allows such a `` userabs '' component in the form of opacity vs. wavelength .",
    "we ran specfit on sdss spectra with the following components : an underlying power law , gaussian emission components of ly  @xmath1  ( narrow + broad ) , , , , , , and a set of absorption templates .",
    "the fitting windows consists of two parts at the following restframe wavelengths : ( 1 ) 1216@xmath91680  , which cover the red wing of ly  @xmath1  and five other emission lines (  [ sub_cos ] ) and ( 2 ) a number of small windows between 1200 and 1216  , where no strong forest line is detected .",
    "we ran tests on the sdss spectra two quasars with different  proximity zones . for sdss1253 + 6817 ,",
    "our fitting results suggest a symmetrical ly  @xmath1  profile , implying a strong proximity profile .",
    "the average opacity @xmath185 over a bin @xmath186   blueward of the ly  @xmath1  wavelength .",
    "the calculation includes 22 pixels that are not in absorption windows . for sdssj1711 + 6052",
    ", the fitting result suggests that the blue ly  @xmath1  wing is weaker than the red wing , as expected from igm absorption .",
    "the average optical depth in a similar wavelength range is @xmath187 .",
    "the s / n in the second quasar is @xmath188 per pixel in the proximity zone , and the errors in our measurements are dominated by pixel - to - pixel variations .",
    "a higher average optical depth with noticeable pixel - to - pixel fluctuations is consistent with a significant structure in the forest lines and a weak proximity effect .",
