    "an important experiment in astronomy is measuring the angular distribution of points on the sky from the arrival directions of incident radiation . when distance information for sources is unavailable ( or too unreliable ) , then techniques for quantifying their two - dimensional angular distribution become essential .",
    "these methods are important for analyzing distributions of point sources , as well as incident radiation from diffuse sources ( or those that appear to be , due to insufficient angular resolution ) .",
    "the information contained in angular distributions depends on the application .",
    "temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) contains information about primordial fluctuations at the epoch of last - scattering , as well as the distribution of matter and ionized gas at subsequent epochs that affected the propagation of the microwaves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the distribution of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or quasars @xcite probes the large scale structure of matter .",
    "high - energy messengers , the focus of this article , have special challenges : charged cosmic rays are deflected , @xmath2-rays can be attenuated , and neutrinos are detected only in small numbers .",
    "directional detection of these messengers allows inferences about their sources and propagation effects .",
    "one popular measure of the angular distribution is its power spectrum @xmath3 , the mean - square - amplitudes of fluctuations with wavelength @xmath4 radians , specified with a basis of spherical harmonics @xmath5 .",
    "these are particularly convenient observables because they characterize the angular scales of anisotropy and they are statistically orthogonal , @xmath6 , for full - sky gaussian - distributed skymaps .",
    "since the @xmath3 are 2-point functions , they represent the lowest order deviations from isotropy .",
    "such harmonic analyses are also applied to the clustering of three - dimensional cosmological data in thin spherical shells to simplify redshift distortion effects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one intent for analyses of galaxy surveys is to determine the statistical properties of the large scale structure in terms of their typical spatial correlations .",
    "these correlations contain information about the physics of the early universe , the expansion history of the universe , and the gravitational collapse of matter .    rather than measure the statistical properties of the spatial distribution , the intent of this paper is to focus on the particular spatial distribution of observations at our particular position in the universe we live in .",
    "we treat the power spectrum as an observable property of the source skymap itself , instead of a measurement of its statistical properties .",
    "one reason to do this is because it provides potentially important information : as the number of detected events increases , the power spectrum of high - energy gamma - rays and neutrinos will converge precisely to the flux power spectrum of their sources . in general ,",
    "harmonic decompositions are a convenient way to express information about the spatial structure of astrophysical observations .    a crucial step in extracting the information",
    "contained in these measurements is assessing their uncertainty .",
    "in general , the statistical variance must be determined from the data itself .    in some cases , one can determine the variance directly from the mean or from other measurements , due to theoretical considerations .",
    "one important example is the variance of the primordial cmb temperature power spectrum , which is strongly constrained to be gaussian - distributed , is measured with incredibly large photon counts , and where the goal is to constrain cosmological parameters . in this case , the limiting statistical uncertainty of the power spectrum is the cosmic variance over the ensemble of universes with the same cosmology and different initial conditions .",
    "proportional to @xmath7 , this uncertainty is estimated with the theoretical power spectrum that best fits the data .",
    "if we did nt have a cosmological theory of the cmb ( but still knew it to be gaussian - distributed ) , then the cosmic variance would need to be approximated from an estimate of @xmath7 using the data alone .",
    "when determining the statistical uncertainty from the data in this way , one must ensure there is enough data to guarantee that the power spectrum s error estimate is sufficiently precise .    if one wants to know the cmb power spectrum in _ our specific sky _",
    ", perhaps to compare with the power spectrum of another related distribution such as known x - ray galaxies , its statistical uncertainty is smaller than the cosmic variance , and the limiting uncertainty is instrument noise .",
    "error analyses that require spatial modelling of the data ( such as assuming gaussianity , for example ) may not be applicable or be easy to properly apply to data that is not well understood .",
    "there are many examples of this .",
    "the sources of ultra - high energy cosmic rays are unknown and their propagation has uncertainties that make modeling the expected signal difficult . as such , quantifying the statistical significance of observed features , such as hotspots @xcite , or dipole phase transitions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , require a spatial - model independent approach ( such as in * ? ? ?",
    "likewise for anisotropy features in high - energy astrophysical ensembles of observed charged cosmic rays ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , neutrinos @xcite , and diffuse @xmath2-rays @xcite .",
    "spatial - model independent approaches are also useful for verifying the applicability of more efficient model - dependent techniques , and providing a fall - back standard to apply in regimes where those models prove inadequate .",
    "a current example of such a modeling challenge is non - gaussianities in the galaxy distribution induced at small distance scales ( including the baryon acoustic oscillation scale ) by non - linear gravitational collapse ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , there is a need for statistical uncertainty estimates of the power spectrum using data alone , independent of information about the radiation s source .",
    "in particular , there has been less development of power spectrum measurements for experiments with a relatively small number of counts .",
    "such experiments do not require data compression techniques to be applied ",
    "the low counts of high energy data may allow exact methods to be computationally tractable , without the need to bin the data into sky - pixels .",
    "_ for these experiments , new techniques are now needed , including methods to determine the variance of observables such as the power spectrum . _    a first precise formulation of this kind is presented in this paper for the angular power spectrum of finite counts .",
    "the statistical framework is minimal and widely applicable , containing only two postulates :    1 .",
    "stationarity  the data consists of point events on a sphere sourced from a stationary skymap distribution @xmath0 , and 2 .   independence ",
    "each observed event is statistically independent of the other events ( poisson process ) , with its spatial probability density function proportional to @xmath8 .",
    "the stationarity postulate is only broken when the data contains significant contributions from transients on time scales of the order of the experiment livetime .",
    "the independence postulate is broken for any beams that exhibit quantum boson bunching ( such as for the cmb ) or fermion antibunching ( as expected in the cosmic neutrino background ) , known as the hbt effect @xcite .",
    "such effects are left for future studies .    with this framework",
    ", we show how to estimate the power spectrum without bias for any finite set of data with at least two events , and show how its variance depends on the source distribution .",
    "in particular , we find new contributions to the statistical variance of the power spectrum , due to the source distribution s power spectrum , bispectrum , and trispectrum .",
    "we provide new unbiased estimates of the variance derived from the data , applicable for any distribution of sources .",
    "this work is immediately important for the high - energy @xmath2-ray anisotropy analyses carried out with _ fermi - lat _ data @xcite .    for simplicity of presentation in this first paper ,",

    "measurements of spherical - mean - normalized angular distributions are indicated throughout with a ` @xmath12 ' .",
    "this section will briefly discuss the existing methods for power spectrum estimation , and preview the main results of this paper for comparison .",
    "the derivation of these results and detailed comparison with the existing methods are then carried out in the next section .",
    "we will see that the current methods are suitable when data sets are very large , such as for galaxy surveys , where the goal is to ascertain the statistical correlations of the spatial distribution of the observations .",
    "galaxy surveys are often analyzed to measure the parameters of a pre - stated cosmological model .",
    "as such , the power spectrum measurements in this context are estimators for the cosmic mean angular spectrum over an ensemble of skies that are realizations of the same distribution ( i.e. produced by the fiducial cosmology ) . because , of course , the experiments are limited to sample only the single sky they have access to , the analysis can never reach a statistical precision better than the cosmic variance of the measurement over the theoretical ensemble of possible skies .",
    "this cosmic variance represents a fundamental statistical limit to the precision that cosmological parameters can be determined for a given cosmological model .",
    "in contrast , detection of high - energy cosmic radiation ( such as @xmath2-rays ) have motivations of determining the sources of the radiation and learning about the high - energy processes that govern the universe .",
    "until a model of sources is established , experiments benefit by first focusing on measurements of the radiation distribution for our specific sky . in this context",
    ", the precision of these measurements is not bounded by cosmic variance ; in fact , the distribution of a static sky can , in principle , be measured to any statistical precision , bounded only by the sky transience and irreducible experimental systematics .",
    "matching the angular distribution of diffuse @xmath2-rays to the distribution of potential sources is an important technique for resolving the @xmath2-ray sky .",
    "the additional precision achieved by measuring the power spectrum of the actual sky ( rather than a cosmic mean power spectrum ) is useful for searches of energy modulation features in the power spectrum from dark matter annihilation @xcite .",
    "not only is the power spectrum of dark matter annihilation predicted to be significantly different from other @xmath2-ray sources @xcite , but it is sensitive to the abundance and profile of dark matter subhalos @xcite , as well as the velocity - dependence of extragalactic annihilations @xcite .",
    "now that the _ fermi - lat _ has determined a diffuse component to the cosmic @xmath2-rays and measured a positive power spectrum , this information is already being used to constrain models of the sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , blazars that are relatively sparse in the sky would generate a large intensity anisotropy if they were too bright , thus limiting their possible contribution to the net diffuse background @xcite .",
    "this pioneering work by the _ fermi - lat _ collaboration had the foresight to estimate the uncertainty of the power spectrum using methods similar to the cosmological experiments ",
    "these correctly estimated the primary sources of uncertainty . the strategy applied by the _ fermi - lat _",
    "working group was to analyze the earliest data set with the assumption that it is gaussian - distributed , and to test these assumptions with subsequent data ( komatsu , private communication ) .",
    "however , we will see that neglected higher order terms due to finite count effects and non - gaussianities can produce non - negligible contributions to the variance of the power spectrum , and can be determined reliably from the data , allowing the assumption of gaussianity to be tested immediately",
    ". neglecting the higher order terms can cause the power spectrum variance to be biased , though whether the bias is positive or negative depends on the properties of the skymap .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that the power spectrum in the highest energy bin @xmath13 was measured to be inconsistently small because subsequent resolved point sources that were not masked in the original analysis appear to produce a larger intensity power spectrum than the original measurement ( an estimated 3@xmath14 discrepancy ) .",
    "this could indicate that the uncertainty in that energy bin was underestimated .",
    "significant non - gaussianities in the distribution of that energy bin would resolve this apparent discrepancy .",
    "we now review the error analysis that is appropriate for the cosmological experiments measuring the statistics of large scale structure and formed the basis for the _ fermi - lat _ analysis .",
    "we then compare this technique to the new exact methods derived in this paper for measuring the power spectrum of our particular sky , which we will preview in this section without derivation .",
    "the results reveal the conditions under which the original analysis applies .",
    "a full derivation is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : clvar ] , and the consequences for inferencing the power spectrum known to be sourced from a gaussian sky is discussed in sec .",
    "[ ssec : gaussian ] .",
    "perhaps the most famous angular power spectrum is of the temperature fluctuations of the cmb .",
    "the gaussianity of these fluctuations implies that their statistical properties are fully specified by their power spectrum .",
    "the method of estimating the power spectrum of the temperature field @xmath15 via the harmonic amplitudes @xmath16,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the mean cmb temperature , is often called the pseudo - spectrum in the cmb literature @xcite @xmath18 the pseudo - spectrum estimator is biased by photon shot noise , sky pixelation noise , and instrument noise with spectrum @xmath19 , which is modeled and subtracted to determine the unbiased estimator @xmath20 of the cmb power spectrum . for example , the instrument noise experienced by the high frequency instrument on the _ planck _ satellite is due to its bolometers detector noise ( designed to be smaller than the photon noise produced from the cosmic background ) , thermal emission from the cooled telescope , and also from the cryogenic filter stages in the telescope @xcite .",
    "while early cmb experiments made use of the pseudo - spectrum estimator , realistic implementations of the pseudo - spectrum analysis must also consider effects due to sky pixelation , masking , non - uniform exposure , and instrument resolution @xcite .",
    "computational limitations require the sky to be pixelized as an effective way to reduce the large volume of data without loss of information @xcite .",
    "modern analyses tend to also use more general quadratic maximum likelihood estimator methods on large data sets , which can be made more computationally feasible @xcite and more precise for certain applications @xcite .",
    "hybrid methods also exist @xcite .",
    "maximum likelihood estimators generally assume the data are spatially gaussian - distributed in order to write down a likelihood function",

    "this pdf can then be used to determine the likelihood function for the actual value for @xmath3 , given a particular set of data , from which the maximum likelihood estimator and minimum variance estimate can be made .",
    "the dependence on @xmath0 , though , requires careful theoretical modeling of the skymap .",
    "when a reliable model of the skymap is unavailable , methods that do not use prior information about the spatial distribution of the skymap may be more desirable .",

    "thus , cosmic variance was included in the error estimate to aid the constraint of theoretical models of extragalactic sources on linear distance scales ; however , its contribution to the error bars was negligible in that analysis .    the main goal of this paper is to carry out a detailed analytic study of the statistical uncertainty of measurements of angular power spectra derived from a finite number of independent random events , where the probability of each individual event observation is weighted according to the source s intrinsic skymap .",

    "it is intriguing this tension could be explained if that energy bin had a significant , positive open bispectrum .",
    "however , before estimates of the higher - order uncertainty contributions can be made using the formulas derived in this paper , they must be modified to additionally take into account the masking of parts of the sky and the non - uniform exposure map .",
    "if a significant open bispectrum is detected in the diffuse @xmath2-ray background , there will be an unfortunate decrease in significance of the measured power spectrum , but this would be in exchange for the exciting detection of higher - order angular correlations that would be very constraining for source population models",
    ". such an observation would indicate significant departure from the galaxy distribution on the scales of structure which is gaussian - distributed , suggesting a source of gamma - rays from a more local distribution .",
    "however , if it is found that @xmath78 has been correctly measured , this immediately puts new bounds on the magnitude of the open bispectrum @xmath187 .",
    "extragalactic sources correlated with large scale structure on linear cosmological distance scales would be expected to be gaussian - distributed to within poisson noise if sparse ( such as active galactic nuclei ) , or gaussian cosmic variance if dense ( for instance , star - forming galaxies ) .",
    "the presence of a large bispectrum would be an indication of a population of sources that is either extragalactic at sub - mpc scales ( from galaxies in the local universe ) , or galactic .",
    "example galactic sources may be a population of unresolved pulsars @xcite , or annihilation in dark matter subhalos @xcite .    a way to probe the presence of an angular bispectrum affecting the power spectrum measurement is to analyze the time - sequence @xmath153 as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "this value of the estimated power spectrum wanders randomly around the actual skymap s power spectrum , with an amplitude that is indicative of the magnitude of the statistical uncertainty . with the collection of additional data , this amplitude diminishes in magnitude",
    "roughly as @xmath44 and the estimator converges to the skymap s power spectrum .",
    "however , an early transition to a signal - dominated error that shrinks as @xmath219 , before the power spectrum has been resolved , would be evidence for the presence of a significant open bispectrum . the robustness of detecting the bispectrum using a single time - sequence of data can be tested with simulations in future work .",
    "now consider other experiments interested in measuring angular power spectra .",
    "for the angular distribution probes of cosmology , such as galaxy surveys , the amount of data is usually so high that the statistical uncertainty is dominated by cosmic variance and the new findings in this paper have no new effect .",
    "however , if galaxy distances can be made precise enough to allow accurate separation into such thin redshift slices that the number of galaxies per redshift slice is @xmath287 , then cosmic variance of each redshift slice may no longer be the dominant statistical uncertainty and the new methods in this paper would be of use .    when counting objects such as galaxies , or blazars , etc .",

    "[ sec : clvar ] is replaced by a selection function that specifies the completeness of observations .",
    "the ` skymap ' refers in this case to the complete map of the objects of interest .    for high - energy radiation events ,",
    "the skymap is the complete apparent flux map of all radiation sources convolved by propagation effects .",
    "the propagation effects are most severe for charged cosmic rays which are deflected and hard - scattered within the medium .",
    "since @xmath2-rays and neutrinos interact less , the measurement of their high - energy angular power spectrum in different energy bins has the potential to identify the sources .",
    "one can use this information to separate distinct components of radiation from different sources @xcite .",
    "even hard spectral features too faint to be seen in the flux spectrum could still be observed in anisotropies @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath2-rays or neutrinos have a particular angular power spectrum that matches the distribution of a potential source , this would be strong evidence for the origin of the high - energy radiation , motivating a cross - correlation analysis to be carried out between the radiation and that particular point source catalog ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a natural application of these methods is to _ icecube _ neutrino data .",
    "the astrophysical component in the energy range 30 tev2 pev has a flux that produces roughly 10 events per year .",
    "if the source is stationary with a large fluctuation power spectrum @xmath288 sr and small or negative open bispectrum , then the power spectrum could be begin to be resolved within 10 years of data .",
    "another interesting analysis is determination of the power spectrum of the lower energy neutrinos from _ icecube _ ; the presence of an anisotropic astrophysical component can be searched for among the highly numerous and isotropic atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "significant power spectra in the arrival direction of charged cosmic rays would indicate angular clustering that potentially contains information about the distribution of nearby sources and the structure of fields and material in the rays path to us @xcite .",
    "a new way to test for the presence of a significant dipole distribution is to determine if the @xmath289 component of the power spectrum is significant .",
    "if this amplitude is significant , the phase of the dipole can be ascertained from the values of the three @xmath289 spherical harmonic transforms .",
    "to summarize , we have carried out an error analysis of the angular power spectrum of a finite set of points on a sphere .",
    "the statistical framework is modeled with only two postulates : a stationary ` skymap ' distribution of sources @xmath0 and the assumption of independence of the detected events . for this analysis , the observation of the points",

    "( [ eq : chatvar2 ] ) .",
    "the power spectrum estimator is consistent with usual pseudo - spectrum techniques , and its statistical variance is found to agree at leading order with previous analytic estimates .",
    "new , previously unquantified effects of the power spectrum variance have been discovered that are generated by three effects : the power spectrum at neighboring multipoles ( the composite power spectrum @xmath41 ) , the bispectrum of the skymap ( in a form called the open bispectrum @xmath42 ) , and the skymap s trispectrum ( given by the disjoint trispectrum @xmath165 ) .",
    "a study of these new higher - order spectra is presented in appendix  [ ap : sphten ] .",
    "they are the only possible ` two - correlator ' spectra , and are also the only spherical tensors that can be derived from rank 2 spherical transforms of the skymap",
    ".    these new higher order effects will be negligible under certain conditions that have been precisely identified . in this work , the power spectrum variance",
    "is called @xmath3-only at those values of @xmath1 where these new higher - order effects are negligible , corresponding to error estimates used in previous works .",
    "the new terms , with the open bispectrum in particular , have the potential to add orders of magnitude to the variance .",
    "thus , the neglect of these new terms may result in spurious detections of the power spectrum .",
    "a negative open bispectrum causes the signal term of the variance to be smaller than @xmath3-only .",
    "the behavior of the power spectrum variance is classified by two regimes in @xmath1 : in the small-@xmath1 regime , the variance is dominated by a shot term that goes as @xmath43 ( for @xmath38 ) ; when @xmath1 is large , a signal term dominates and the variance goes as @xmath44 .",
    "the composite power spectrum minus disjoint trispectrum is a new contribution to the shot term , added to the shot noise variance .",
    "the signal term , which in previous work was the variance due to the power spectrum itself , is found to have additional terms from the open bispectrum minus disjoint trispectrum .",
    "an unbiased estimator of the power spectrum s variance is identified in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : varhatchat ] ) or eqn .",
    "( [ eq : varhatchat2 ] ) , calculated from the data .",
    "remarkably , this estimate is made without any prior assumptions about properties of the skymap spatial distribution .",
    "efficient , highly parallelizable codes have been shown to be very efficient at calculating this variance from position data .",
    "this makes these exact methods viable for use ( at least for the full sky , uniform exposure limit ) to quite large counts , relaxing the necessity of binning the data into pixels on the sphere , which either introduces the need to correct for ` pixel ' features in the power spectrum , or uses a large number of tiny pixels that requires more computation to determine the spectrum than the exact method .",
    "these estimators are very important , providing a means for experiments to test for the presence of higher - order contributions to the power spectrum uncertainty .",
    "the presence of a large open bispectrum in the diffuse @xmath2-ray background measured by _ fermi - lat _ would decrease the significance of the measured power spectrum , but would provide exciting new information about the distribution of the source populations . on",
    "the other hand , verification of the existing power spectrum measurements would provide stringent bounds on the magnitude of non - gaussianities in the distribution .",
    "those @xmath2-ray distributions consistent with being gaussian to within cosmic variance are consistent with being produced by extragalactic sources over linear cosmological distances .",
    "the presence of non - gaussianities would suggest the presence of a population of more local sources , either near - extragalactic , or galactic sources .",
    "we showed how these results can be applied to a statistical model of the spatial distribution of the skymap by considering an example analysis of a gaussian - distributed skymap . in this context , the prediction of the power spectrum is subject to cosmic variance from statistical variations between different skymap realizations of the gaussian process .",
    "the open bispectrum vanishes for gaussian distributions .",
    "otherwise , the previous analytic estimates for the uncertainty of the power spectrum in these measurements was reproduced to first order , with additional higher order contributions from the composite power spectrum and disjoint trispectrum as expressed in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : clvargauss ] ) .",
    "these new contributions become important at large @xmath22 since these new terms are not suppressed by @xmath203 , as is the case for the standard terms . the usual uncertainty",
    "is restored when enough data is collected for the statistical uncertainty to be dominated by the cosmic variance .",
    "thus , power spectrum measurements of large data sets that are cosmic variance limited remain unaffected by the new findings .",
    "the effect of the instrument point spread function ( psf ) on the power spectrum measurement is found to simply be that the measured spectra are of the skymap convolved with the psf .",
    "however , further effects may be induced by asymmetric psfs on the inference of the cosmic mean power spectrum of a modeled ensemble of universes .",
    "simulations were carried out of two skymaps of equivalent power spectrum , but one without open bispectrum and the other with significant open bispectrum .",
    "the standard deviation of power spectrum estimates using the simulated data were shown to prefer the variance results of this paper with the bispectrum effect over the @xmath3-only variance .",
    "the new formalism in this paper is important for smaller datasets , such as for events of incident high - energy radiation , where the power spectrum provides information about the distribution of sources and propagation effects .",
