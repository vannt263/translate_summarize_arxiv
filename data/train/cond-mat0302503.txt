    "the presence in a solid of randomly - distributed imperfections causes its electrons to propagate diffusively rather than ballistically . as a result ,",
    "when two electrons interact , they tarry in each other s vicinity , and become more strongly correlated @xcite . as shown by finkelstein @xcite and castellani ,",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite , this effect leads to an instability of the diffusive fermi liquid fixed point ( see also refs . ) which manifests itself through divergent corrections to a variety of physical quantities .",
    "the instability exists for arbitrarily weak coupling and for arbitrarily weak disorder .",
    "its simplest incarnation is in an electron system in a weak magnetic field @xmath1 which suppresses quantum interference effects and relegates them to subleading order in the dimensionless resistance@xcite @xmath2 ( measured in units of @xmath3 ) while interactions make a contribution at leading order .",
    "since the relevant interaction is in the spin - triplet particle - hole channel , the @xmath4 factor must be tuned to zero if @xmath5 so that there is no zeeman splitting , which would cut off the divergences .",
    "though this instability was identitified nearly 20 years ago , there is , at present , no consensus on its outcome .",
    "the recent discovery of evidence for a metal - insulator transition in two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) in si - mosfets @xcite , gaas @xcite heterostructures , and si - ge @xcite has led to a re - examination of the problem of interacting electrons in a random potential .",
    "the interesting phenomena seen in these experiments occur in a regime in which interactions are strong ( large @xmath6 ) and quantum interference effects are likely to be important because the conductivity is on the order of the quantum limit @xmath7 and @xmath8 . though a number of interesting theories @xcite have been proposed , none have provided a complete explanation of the experimental data , which is nt surprising , given that the presumably simpler problem of weakly - interacting electrons in a weak random potential with @xmath5 , @xmath9 remains unsolved .",
    "it is this simpler problem which is the subject of this paper    though it is unresolved , the instability caused by the triplet interaction is , in fact , a crime with only one plausible suspect : ferromagnetism .",
    "since the diffusive fermi liquid is unstable , the system must settle into some other phase at low temperature ; since the instability is in the spin - triplet channel , it is presumably one in which the spins are ordered .",
    "the basic interaction in this problem is exchange , which is ferromagnetic .",
    "there is no available mechanism which generates antiferromagnetic interactions . to see this , note that the instability occurs when the conductance is large , while superexchange occurs in or near an insulating state ( since it arises when the kinetic energy is treated as a perturbation )",
    "there would be rkky interactions between localized spins , such as magnetic impurities , if we had any , but we do nt . in the absence of any antiferromagnetic interactions , we rule out spin density - waves ( sdws)@xcite , spin glass order , and random singlet phases@xcite .",
    "the latter two furthermore require large effective disorder while the instability of interest here is manifest for small effective disorder@xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the instability of the triplet interaction signals the formation of ` local moments'@xcite . in the weak - interaction , weak - disorder limit , however , the instability of the diffusive fermi liquid only develops at large length scales , so the resulting magnetic moments are anything but ` local ' .",
    "local moments might be expected when the energy cost for flipping a spin at short length scales is very small .",
    "this might occur near the stoner transition of the clean system @xcite , where the critical susceptibility , @xmath10 , is of curie form for a mean - field exponent @xmath11 .",
    "there is also a substantial local moment regime with curie susceptibility in the large-@xmath12 hubbard model ( because of the weakness of superexchange for large @xmath12 ) and doped semiconductors ( because of competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions ) .",
    "however , these scenarios are not relevant to the presumably simpler , though still non - trivial , problem of the weakly - interacting , weakly - disordered limit .",
    "this leaves us with one remaining possibility and , indeed , a number of authors have proposed that the singularity of the triplet interaction channel leads to ferromagnetism .",
    "the basic underlying physics is simply that diffusing electrons interact more strongly because they move more slowly and , as a result , the interaction energy gained by ( at least partially ) polarizing the system _ always _ outweighs the single - particle energy cost , in contrast to a clean system , where the interaction energy gain is a constant @xmath12 which must exceed the single - particle energy cost @xmath13 , i.e. the stoner criterion ( @xmath14 is the density of states at the fermi energy ) . andreev and kamenev @xcite proposed such a mechanism for finite - size systems by computing the disorder enhancement of the interaction matrix element for a state with two electrons in single - particle states separated by small energies .",
    "heuristically , one can say that the two wavefunctions are concentrated in the same minima of the potential .",
    "chamon and mucciolo @xcite found a ferromagnetic saddle - point solution of the one - loop effective action of finkelstein s theory .",
    "their calculation generalizes stoner s by including quantum corrections resulting from interactions between diffusion modes .",
    "belitz and kirkpatrick @xcite advanced the same hypothesis when they noted that the phase transition which they expected to be driven by the growth of the triplet interaction is of the same form as a transition to ferromagnetism in a disordered system .    in this paper , we calculate the effective action for the magetization in a weakly - interacting electron system in a slightly dirty metal .",
    "the effective action is calculated to lowest order in the dimensionless resistance @xmath2 .",
    "it exhibits the physics described above and is clearly unstable to the formation of a ferromagnetic moment . in principle , the emergence of some other type of order could intervene ( this effect would have to be non - perturbative in @xmath2 ) before ferromagnetism develops , but the arguments given above rule out this possibility .",
    "thus , we conclude that in the limit of small @xmath2 , the singularity of the spin - triplet interaction channel leads to ferromagnetism .",
    "our results substantiate the conclusions of previous authors @xcite .",
    "the basic philosophy is simple : since the rg equations tell us that the interaction in the triplet channel grows in importance as the energy scale is lowered , we try to satisfy this term in the action first by allowing the magnetization , @xmath15 , to develop a non - zero expectation value . in order to do this ,",
    "we compute an effective action @xmath16 $ ] for the magnetization @xmath15 taking finkelstein s ` non - linear @xmath17-model ' for interacting electrons in a disordered system as the point of departure . since our goal is to calculate an effective action @xmath16 $ ] to lowest order in the resistance @xmath2 , finkelstein s @xmath17-model is merely a convenient way of organizing the pertinent diagrams .",
    "we believe that it is intuitively appealing to follow finkelstein and work directly with a theory which retains only diffusion modes and drops the superfluous high - energy electronic degrees of freedom , but this is a matter of convenience , and it is a option which we can take regardless of whether new terms are generated at the two - loop or higher level ( i.e. regardless of whether the non - linear terms in the theory are really related by symmetry , as they would be in a @xmath17-model ) .",
    "our derivation emphasizes the similarity between , on the one hand , the rg equation for the triplet - channel interaction in a dirty metal and the consequent development of ferromagnetism with , on the other hand , the rg equation for the cooper - channel interaction in a clean fermi liquid and the consequent development of superconductivity .",
    "we believe that this illuminates the inevitability of our conclusion .    once ferromagnetic order has developed , the system becomes essentially one of spinless electrons whose diffusion is decoupled from the spin waves of the system . in this regime , the suppression of the resistivity which accompanies the growth of the triplet interaction parameter",
    "thus , our results indicate that a metallic state , if it exists in two dimensions , does not owe its existence to the growth of the triplet interaction parameter .    in two dimensions",
    ", our results should be interpreted as follows .",
    "as we lower the temperature , the system develops local ferromagnetic order as we cross the mean - field transition temperature @xmath18 .",
    "the spin density is controlled by classical thermal fluctuations which prevent order and lead to a correlation length @xmath19 at low - temperatures .",
    "in the regime @xmath20 , we have a system in which charge diffuses while the spins are gapped .",
    "the localization physics of this system is essentially the same as that of spinless electrons , so the system leaves the diffusive regime and eventually becomes localized .",
    "thus , our small @xmath2 analysis can not be used all the way to zero temperature .",
    "the trend is towards a ferromagnetic insulator , but the onset of insulating behavior can thwart the development of ferromagnetism .",
    "recent experiments @xcite performed near the metal - insulator transition indicate an enhancement of the spin susceptibility which is cut off by the onset of insulating behavior .",
    "the metal - insulator transition is outside of the regime of validity of our calculation , but this is , nevertheless , qualitatively consistent with our picture .    in @xmath21 dimensions ,",
    "when the interaction strength is larger than a threshhold value of @xmath22 , there is a ferromagnetic transition at a finite temperature @xmath23 .",
    "if the resistance is smaller than a critical value @xmath24 , then the resistance will remain finite down to zero temperature , where the system is in a metallic ferromagnetic state .",
    "we begin with a system of interacting electrons moving in a quenched random potential @xmath25 in @xmath26 .",
    "the imaginary - time action is @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] for later convenience , we have written the second term in momentum space and have split the interaction into nearly forward scattering , in which electrons with momenta and spins @xmath30 , @xmath31 are scattered to @xmath32 , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and exchange scattering , in which @xmath36 , @xmath37 . if the microscopic electron - electron interaction is @xmath38 , then the associated bare couping constants are @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "as finkelstein noted , these are subject to finite fermi liquid renormalization in the ballistic regime , even before they begin to flow in the diffusive regime .",
    "we assume that the system is in a weak magnetic field , so that we can ignore cooper scattering , for which @xmath41 , @xmath42 .    in order to perform the average over the quenched random potential , we replicate the theory and then average the replicated functional integral over the probability distribution @xmath43 .",

    "the resulting effective action now contains four quartic terms : one disorder term and two interaction terms .",
    "note that the disorder term is non - local in time since it only depends on two matsubara frequencies , and it couples different replicas .",

    "however , strictly speaking , the formal relationship between the rg equation and the effective action ( [ eq : delta - action2 ] ) follows from the cutoff - independence of physically - measurable quantities , @xmath235 being the simplest .",
    "from ( [ eq : delta - action2 ] ) , we see that the saddle - point value of @xmath235 is @xmath245 differentiating both sides with respect to @xmath164 and requiring that @xmath246 vanish , we find : @xmath247 which is equivalent to the rg equation ( [ eq : gn - rgeqn ] )",
    ".        now , consider @xmath251 , where @xmath235 is introduced to decouple the @xmath4 interaction , as before",
    ". we can no longer calculate it exactly .",
    "however , if we assume that @xmath252 , we can calculate it to lowest non - trivial order in @xmath253 .",
    "the lowest order diagram by which it contributes is the second one of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 - 3-loop - toy ] .",
    "we integrate out @xmath237 completely and integrate out all @xmath254 fluctuations above some cutoff @xmath255 .",
    "we are free to choose @xmath255 as we like , of course , but the natural choice is @xmath256 so that our effective action is for excitations with energies of order @xmath235 .",
    "the resulting effective action is @xmath257 the last term looks strange .",
    "it looks like an @xmath258 renormalization of @xmath243 , which would imply a contribution of order @xmath259 to @xmath260 . also , this term is proportional to @xmath261 rather than @xmath262 as we might have expected from the second diagram of fig . [",
    "fig : gn - one - loop ] and the rg equation ( [ eq : gn-rgeqn ] ) .",
    "the problem is that we are looking at @xmath263 , which is not observable , rather than the vacuum expectation value of @xmath235 , which is .",
    "when we compute @xmath235 , the two difficulties noted above resolve each other . minimizing the effective action",
    ", we find that , to lowest non - trivial order in v : @xmath264 or @xmath265 requiring @xmath164-independence of @xmath235 , we recover the rg equation for @xmath4  and also the rg equation for @xmath253 which we did nt compute .",
    "the lesson is that a one - loop contribution to the rg equation for a coupling constant might manifest itself in an effective action only through a higher - loop ( in the above example , three - loop ) diagram . in the interacting electron problem in a random potential , diagrams ( a ) ,",

    "note that finkelstein uses @xmath4 to denote resistance , as did chamon , ludwig , and nayak , in keeping with his notation .",
    "however , the more widespread usage is for @xmath4 to denote conductance . to avoid confusion ,",

    "when the bare interaction is weak , disorder does not allow the former , an sdw , and its necessary concomitant , a cdw , to form since the energy scale at which the interaction becomes strong is small compared to the inverse of the elastic scattering time .",
    "on the other hand , one can imagine that strong interactions could lead to the formation of an sdw in the ballistic regime , i.e. at length scales shorter than the mean - free path . at longer scales",
    ", sdw order would be disrupted by impurities , but the correlation length could be long if the impurity density is low . in the problem which we consider , however , interactions are assumed to be weak in the ballistic regime .",
    "they only become strong in the diffusive regime , where sdw order will not develop .",
    "what we really mean by this is that spin glass order can not be important _ at this scale_. however , local ferromagnetism , which develops at the scale at which the triplet interaction becomes strong , could be disrupted at longer scales ( at which the effective disorder strength is large ) so that spin glass order ",
    "e.g. a cluster spin glass  forms at the longest length scales .",
    "furthermore , in an insulating state , caused by wigner crystallization and/or anderson localization , a spin glass could form since there will be competition between different multi - spin exchange process which lead to effective spin - spin interactions of different signs ."
