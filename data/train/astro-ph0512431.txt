    "nuclear rings , looking prominent features due to their intense star formation , are found mostly in barred galaxies so they are commonly treated as linked to inner lindblad resonances where all radial gas inflows are slowed down and where gas is accumulated @xcite .",
    "however there are several cases of spectacular nuclear rings in unbarred galaxies , such as those in ngc 278 , ngc 7217 , ngc 7702 , ngc 7742 .",
    "most of these galaxies are seen face - on , so the conclusion about the bar absence is quite safe in them .",
    "suggestions about the nature of nuclear rings in unbarred galaxies includes : resonance effects produced by weakly triaxial potential @xcite ; resonance effects produced by a past bar which is now dissolved @xcite ; viscous gas accretion produced by rotation velocity shear in the global disk and its accumulation at a stagnation point at the turnover radius of the rotation curve @xcite ; finally , minor merger @xcite . among these hypotheses , the last provides more opportunities to explain various combinations of observational facts .",
    "indeed , @xcite have shown that vertical central impact of a small satellite whose mass is about 10%  of the host mass should produce a nuclear stellar ring which is morphologically indistinguishable from a resonance ring .",
    "on the other hand , if the merged satellite orbit was close to the main galaxy disk plane , their gravitational interaction might produce an oval disk distortion which could in its turn create a resonance nuclear ring .",
    "however , certain combinations of predictions are provided by each theoretical model , and by collecting more various observational data , both morphological and kinematical , for every galaxy in question , we would be able at last to restrict possible mechanisms of nuclear ring generation in any particular case .    in this paper we will consider ngc 7742 and ngc 7217 ; both galaxies have prominent nuclear star - formation rings with a radius of some @xmath0 .",
    "we will attempt to find any general features which may be connected to the nuclear ring origin .",
    "as for the latter galaxy , now we are undertaking our third approach to its study .",
    "earlier we have found a circumnuclear gas polar ring and two exponential stellar disks with different scalelengths in it @xcite .",
    "also , ngc 7217 is known to possess two counterrotating stellar subsystems @xcite .",
    "recently the sauron team has also found a gas - stars counterrotation in the center of ngc 7742 @xcite , so this fact promises interesting speculations .",
    "both galaxies are moderate - luminosity unbarred spirals of sb - type .",
    "new observational data which we intend to analyse in this work concerns mainly ngc 7742 : panoramic spectral data for ngc 7742 have been obtained with the scanning fabry - perot interferometer ( ifp ) of the 6 m telescope of the special astrophysical observatory of the russian academy of sciences ( sao ras ) and with two integral - field spectrographs , the fiber - lens multi - pupil fiber spectrograph ( mpfs ) at the 6 m telescope of the sao ras and the international tigre - mode sauron at the 4.2 m william herschel telescope at la palma ( see table  1 ) .",
    "our 2d spectroscopic data for ngc 7217 have been described in detail earlier : the fabry - perot data  by @xcite and the mpfs data  by @xcite .      the present modification of the mpfs of the 6 m telescope works at the prime focus from the summer of 1998 @xcite ; see also http://www.sao.ru/hq/lsfvo/devices/mpfs/ ) .",
    "ngc 7742 was observed with the mpfs several times during 20012003 .",
    "mpfs is a fiber - lens system : densely packed square microlenses placed in the focal plane of the telescope create a set of @xmath1 micropupils , or @xmath2 in 2003 , and the fibers after them transmit the light from the square elements of the galaxy image to the slit of the spectrograph together with 16 ( 17 ) additional fibers that transmit the sky background light taken at a distance of @xmath3 from the galaxy , so the sky spectra are obtained together with those of the target .",
    "the size of one spatial element is approximately @xmath4 ; a ccd tk @xmath5 and during the latest run of october 2003  a ccd eev 42 - 40 @xmath6 were used .",
    "the spectral resolution was about 4    varying by about 20%  over the field of view .",
    "the wavelength calibration was done with a he - ne - ar lamp before and after the galaxy exposures ; the internal accuracy of linearization was typically 0.25    in the green and 0.1    in the red .",
    "also we checked the accuracy of the wavelength calibration and the absence of a systematic velocity shift by measuring strong emission lines of the night sky , [ ] @xmath75577 and [ ] @xmath76300 .",
    "we obtained the mpfs data in two spectral ranges , green , 43005600   , and red , 59007200   .",
    "the green spectra were used to obtain the line - of - sight velocity field for the stellar component and a map of the stellar velocity dispersion by their cross - correlation with spectra of some template stars , usually of g8iii ",
    "k1iii spectral type .",
    "the red spectral range which contains strong emission lines h@xmath8 and [ ] @xmath76583 is appropriate to derive line - of - sight velocity fields of the ionized gas .",

    "the sky background is taken less than 2 arcminutes from the center of the galaxy and is exposed simultaneously with the target .",
    "the spectral range is fixed as of 4800 - 5400   , the spectral resolution is about 4   , also varying over the field of view .",

    "the total number of 32 spectral channels were exposed , each during 3 minutes , providing the spectral resolution of 2.5   .",
    "the seeing was @xmath11 ; the spatial binning used was @xmath12 per pixel , and the full field of view obtained was @xmath13 .",
    "the narrow filter centered on the spectral region around redshifted h@xmath8 and [ ] @xmath76583 emission lines was used .",
    "the velocity field of the ionized gas obtained by measuring the h@xmath8 is more precise and extended whereas the measurements of [ ] allow to probe the very center of the galaxy where the h@xmath8 emission is strongly contaminated by the absorption line .    as we discuss below ,",
    "both velocity fields give consistently the orientation parameters of the gas disk : the kinematical major axis , or the line - of - nodes , at @xmath14 and inclination of @xmath15 .",
    "to supplement our 2d spectroscopy by additional data , we have retrieved some long - slit data for ngc 7742 from the ing archive : the galaxy was observed in november 1997 with the two - armed isis spectrograph of the 4.2 m william herschel telescope .",
    "however , the quality of these data seems to be insufficient : evidently , the spectral focus was not checked promptly , and the spectral resolution was bad .",
    "so we have only measured baricenters of the most prominent emission lines in the long - slit cross - section of @xmath16 to determine line - of - sight velocities of the ionized gas near the center of the galaxy ; either gas velocity dispersion nor stellar kinematics are not probed .",
    "this direction of the slit , @xmath16 , is not very close to the kinematical major axis of the gas .",
    "so to obtain more conclusive data , in november 2004 we have observed ngc 7742 at the 6 m telescope with the focal reducer scorpio in the long - slit mode with a large spectral range of 5700 - 7200    and a spectral resolution of about 5   .",

    "the k - giants hd 4744 and 20893 were observed the same night at the same mode ; their spectra were used for cross - correlation with the spectra of the galaxy .      the same night , on 5th of november , 2004 , we obtained a rather deep v - image of ngc 7742 during 240 s with the focal reducer scorpio in the imaging mode ( pixel scale was @xmath19 and the seeing was @xmath20 ) .",

    "we have used the 2mass images taken from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database .",
    "the data have been mostly analysed by using the software produced by dr .",
    "vlasyuk of the special astrophysical observatory @xcite ; only primary reduction of the data obtained with the mpfs and scorpio ( images and long slit ) was done in idl with various pieces of software created by one of us ( a.v.m . ) and by prof .",
    "v. l. afanasiev .",
    "the v - image of ngc 7742 obtained with the reducer scorpio has been calibrated into the standard johnson system by using the single photoelectric aperture measurement by @xcite .",
    "the data observed with the ifp were reduced with the idl - based software described by @xcite . also the adhoc package was involved to smooth the `` data cubes '' .",
    "the monochromatic images and velocity fields of the emission lines h@xmath8 and [ ] @xmath76583 were constructed by means of fitting the ifp spectra with gaussians .",
    "we analysed two kinds of data : one with the original spatial resolution ( @xmath25 ) and the other smoothed by a gaussian filter with fwhm of @xmath26 elements ( the spatial resolution of @xmath27 ) .",
    "the results are mainly the same , but the last data are better for the low - brightness regions .",
    "@xcite having presented the sauron 2d velocity fields both for stars and for the ionized gas in ngc 7742  the latter obtained from their sophisticated measurement of the weak [ ] @xmath75007 emission line  have claimed an appearance of strict counterrotation of the stars versus the gas .",
    "however they have shown only the very central parts of the velocity fields within the nuclear ring ( @xmath28 ) , so it has remained unclear if we deal with a global counterrotation or with a compact circumnuclear counterrotating gaseous disk .",
    "figure  [ ifp7742 ] presents our large - scale fabry - perot observations of ngc 7742 in the h@xmath8 and [ ] emission lines . in the upper two rows we give the distributions of the emission - line intensities ( left ) and the velocity fields ( right )",
    ", the bottom right plot presents the results of the velocity field analysis made by a tilted - ring method @xcite .",
    "one can see that despite the face - on view of the galactic disk , the line - of - sight velocity field of the ionized gas demonstrates a quite regular rotation up to the border of the noticeable h@xmath8 emission at @xmath29 , with the visible amplitude of line - of - sight velocity variations of about 40 km / s . by fixing the kinematic center position that coincides reasonably well with the photometric center and also the systemic velocity and by assuming the same orientation angles , line - of - nodes position angle @xmath30 and inclination @xmath31 , for the whole gaseous disk",
    ", we obtain rather sure estimates of the disk orientation parameters : @xmath32 and @xmath33 . with these parameters of the disk orientation",
    ", the azimuthally averaged circular rotation velocity can be estimated as 220 - 230 km / s within the nuclear ring radius , @xmath34 ; outside it decreases smoothly to @xmath35 km / s at @xmath36 . at the outer edge of the nuclear disk",
    "we note a drop of the rotation velocity by @xmath37 km / s ; another drop , more prominent in the h@xmath8 velocity field than in the [ ] velocity field , can be detected at the radii of @xmath38 .",
    "as we shall show below , the latter radius is also distinguished photometrically .",
    "so we may conclude that the sense of the gas rotation ( which is opposite to the stars rotation in the center ) remains unchanged up to the large radii .",
    "we can even expand the spatial range , over which the conclusion is valid , beyond the borders of h@xmath8 emission .",
    "@xcite measured an emission line of the neutral hydrogen , @xmath721 cm , in several positions near ngc 7742 .",
    "though their spacing and half - beam resolution was rather rough , of about @xmath39 , they detected a noticeable rotation ` in an east - west direction ' , the eastern side of the hi disk being receding .",
    "so we conclude that ngc 7742 possesses the large gaseous disk which rotates regularly so that its eastern side is receding ; the line of nodes of this disk is at @xmath14 , and the inclination can be determined kinematically as @xmath40 .",
    "figure  [ mpfs7742 ] presents the circumnuclear velocity field of the ionized gas which we have obtained with the mpfs by measuring the strongest emission line of this region , [ ] @xmath76583 .",
    "these data compliment the large - scale gas velocity field obtained with the ifp . over this velocity field",
    "also , we see a regular rotation , with the visible amplitude of the line - of - sight velocity variations of @xmath41 km / s , and its kinematical major axis at radii larger than @xmath42 can be determined quite certainly as @xmath43 , being completely consistent with the line of nodes of the global gaseous disk .",
    "however , if we apply the inclination of @xmath44 found for the global gas disk to the circumnuclear velocity field we would obtain a formal value of the circular rotation velocity of 400 km / s at @xmath45 .",
    "this seems improbable for the galaxy of such moderate luminosity , inconsistent with the tully - fisher relation ; moreover , the central stellar velocity dispersion in ngc 7742 estimated by us both with the mpfs and the sauron data is less than 80 km / s , so there are no any signs of huge mass concentration in the nucleus of this galaxy .",
    "we should rather conclude that the inclination of @xmath44 is not valid for the very central part of the gaseous disk , @xmath46 , and that the disk begins to warp when approaching the nucleus .",
    "the sauron data were obtained under better seeing conditions than ours , and in the recently delivered ph.d .",
    "thesis of kambiz fathi @xcite the gas velocity field of ngc 7742 reveals a turn of its kinematical major axis by @xmath47 at @xmath48 .",
    "the comment of dr .",
    "fathi is that we see radial gas motions .",
    "but if the gaseous disk remains to be nearly face - on around the nucleus , we would not see any noticeable projection of radial velocities confined within the disk onto the line of sight .",
    "indeed , if we accept the inclination of @xmath44 obtained for the whole gaseous disk for the very center of ngc 7742 , the fathi s results would imply an amplitude of the possible radial motions exceeding twice the rotation velocities  namely , of @xmath49 km / s .",
    "we do not see any reason to suspect such supersonic radial gas flows in the morphologically regular galaxy with the nuclear activity of a rather weak liner / transition type .",
    "more probably , we see here an inclined circumnuclear disk similar to those found in some spiral galaxies , and in particular in ngc 7217 @xcite .    as for the stellar rotation , it does not seem to be so fast as that of the gas and is mostly confined to the very inner , @xmath50 , region of the galaxy . since the seeing conditions during our mpfs observations of ngc 7742 were not good enough to resolve this small region properly , the measured amplitude of the stellar line - of - sight velocity variations is dropped due to spatial smoothing , and the orientation of the kinematical major axis can not be determined properly from our data . in fig .",
    "[ sau7742 ] we show our analysis of the sauron velocity field for the stars in the center of ngc 7742 .",
    "we have obtained @xmath51 for the stellar component within @xmath52 , in some disagreement with @xmath53 found by fathi ; however , the possible error may be as large as @xmath54 .",
    "if again we formally fix the inclination of the rotation plane of the stars at the value obtained for the outer gaseous disk , @xmath15 , the peak rotation velocity achieved at @xmath55 would be @xmath56 km / s . farther from the nucleus it drops to zero at the radius of the ring , and beyond the ring it rises marginally .",
    "due to low signal - to - noise ratio we are not sure with our results at @xmath57 , and to check if the stars continue to counterrotate the gas outside the ring radius we appeal to the long - slit data .",
    "figure  [ ls7742 ] presents long - slit velocity profiles for the stars and ionized gas : scorpio data along the kinematical major axis @xmath14 and wht / isis data at @xmath16 . because of the low surface brightness of ngc 7742 at @xmath57 , the measurements of the stellar velocities ( fig .",
    "[ ls7742]_a _ ) are not very extended and are not very precise ; however some qualitative conclusions can be made .",
    "the sense of rotation of the stellar component observed in the center persists up to @xmath58 at least ; but at @xmath28  at the radius of the ring  we see strong stellar velocity variations , such that the line - of - sight velocities of the stars at this radius coincide exactly with those of the ionized gas .",
    "we may suggest that violent star formation in the ring has already produced a substantial stellar population , including stars of f - g - k type , so that their rotation coupled with their parent gas contributes significantly into the integrated losvd of the stars at this radius .",
    "the long - slit gas velocity profiles ( figs .  [ ls7742]_b _ and _ c _ ) demonstrate different character with respect to the rather smooth rotation curve obtained by azimuthal averaging of the 2d ifp gas velocity field ( fig .",
    "[ ifp7742 ] ) .",
    "they oscillate by 70 - 80 km / s with a characteristics radial period of @xmath59 , and the locations of the velocity maxima and minima differ at @xmath14 and at @xmath16 .",
    "we think that these velocity variations do not relate to regular rotation ; they resemble vertical small - scale oscillations of a tidally perturbed gaseous disk .",
    "another peculiarity of the long - slit gas velocity profiles which we have however expected basing on our 2d mpfs data is the very steep central velocity gradient and the decoupled fast gas rotation within @xmath60 ; it is confirmed both by the scorpio and isis data .",
    "moreover , the [ ] emission line measurements at the approaching branch of the velocity profile give even underestimated values of the rotation velocity  they deviate toward the systemic velocity not only with respect to the h@xmath8 measurements which may be affected by underlying absorption lines , but also with respect to the [ ] emission line measurements .",
    "similar differences between velocity estimates made with different emission lines had been detected more than once in the centers of other spiral galaxies@xcite and might be explained if the h@xmath8 and [ ] emission lines relate to regularly rotating gas ionized by ob stars and the [ ] emission lines are formed mostly in shock wave sites where the ionized gas decelerates",
    ". enormous visible rotation of the ionized gas within @xmath60 revealed by the long - slit data gives strong evidence for the highly - inclined orientation of the gas rotation plane in the very center of ngc 7742 ( @xmath61 ) , as opposite to the nearly face - on orientation of the global gaseous disk .",
    "the morphological type of ngc 7742 is sa(r)b , and taking into account the face - on orientation of the global disk , the galaxy looks indeed quite round and axisymmetric , except the very central part ( fig .",
    "[ ifp7742 ] ) . however , the rather early morphological type , sb , deduced perhaps from the appearance of tightly wound , faint spiral arms , is not supported by the very low stellar velocity dispersion in the center , @xmath62 km / s , implying the absence of a large bulge that is obliged to be a dynamically hot stellar subsystem by definition .",
    "the v - band image obtained with the scorpio appears to be very deep : our surface brightness measurements reaches the radius almost twice that of 25th b - magnitude . figure  [ iso7742 ] presents the results of isophotal analysis of this image , together with the measurements of the i - band image taken from the ing archive which is almost similarly deep",
    "the ellipticity behavior reveals central rise and a peak near the position of the nuclear ring ; the isophotes in the radius range of @xmath63 ( please note that @xmath64 ) are indeed round",
    ". however the most interesting things are seen at @xmath65 : the ellipticity rises to the mean value of 0.15 , and the major axis position angle can be measured quite certainly at @xmath66 .",
    "we can not be sure that we see a round outer stellar disk inclined by @xmath67 to the line of sight because the kinematical parameters of the orientation of the more inner _ gaseous _ disk , @xmath43 and @xmath15 , does not coincide with the photometric parameters found for the outermost part of the broad - band image ; the hypothesis which may be more plausible is that the outer disk is intrinsically oval .",
    "unfortunately , we have no detailed kinematical measurements at such large radii .",
    "we have tried to decompose the whole v - image into separate photometric subcomponents , such as an outer exponential disk and some more inner components .",
    "two methods were applied : the software gidra @xcite which uses 2d surface brightness modelling under constant orientation parameters over all the image and iterative 1d brightness profile fitting starting from the outermost component with subsequent subtraction of the 2d model components from the original image ; the latter method allows to vary orientation parameters from one component to another according to isophote analysis results .",
    "the gidra analysis of the v - image , under the fixed kinematical parameters of the orientation , @xmath68 and @xmath15 , with an approximation of the seeing fwhm by @xmath20 , has given two exponential disks superposed , with the scalelengths of @xmath69 and @xmath70 and the central surface brightnesses , @xmath71 , of 20.6 and 18.2 mag per square arcsecond .",
    "the third photometric component seen only in the very center may be a de vaucouleurs bulge with @xmath72 .",
    "one - dimensional brightness profile fitting made with @xmath73 and with isophote axis ratio of @xmath74 for the outer component and with @xmath75 and @xmath76 for the inner components has also given two exponential disks : the outermost one being approximated in the radius range of @xmath77 has @xmath78 and @xmath79 and the inner one , seen in the radius range of @xmath80 after subtracting the outer disk , has @xmath81 and @xmath82  see the fig .",
    "[ disk7742 ] .",
    "the most central component which is left after subtraction of two exponential disks gives a noticeable contribution only inside @xmath83 , and since it is affected by spatial resolution effects we can not surely determine shape of its profile : it may be exponential as well as something else .",
    "however both our fitting methods indicate certainly the presence of two exponential disks with different scalelengths .",
    "we would like to stress that it is the outer disk which is ` normal ' : its @xmath71 , 21 v - mag per square arcsec , is very close to the canonical freeman s value @xcite , and the relation between its central surface brightness and its scalelength in kpc is typical for sb - galaxy @xcite . the inner disk is more compact and high - surface - brightness one than spiral galaxies have usually , though not so compact and bright as circumnuclear disks of early - type galaxies ; on the diagram ` @xmath84 vs h ' collected by @xcite it settles among the large disks of lenticular galaxies .",
    "however the spiral arms and noticeable star formation ( h@xmath8 emission ) in ngc 7742 are confined just to this inner disk .",
    "interestingly , ngc 7217  another galaxy with rings and without a bar  has very similar structure .",
    "we have decomposed its brightness profile in our work @xcite and have found two exponential disks , the outermost disk being the ` normal ' one , together with the compact exponential bulge .",
    "we compare the structural characteristics of the components for both galaxies in table 2 .",
    "the scalelengths are very close : 23 kpc for the outer disks and @xmath85 kpc for the inner disks .",
    "the visible shapes of the outer and inner disks are different in both galaxies .",
    "however , if to compare the derived photometric characteristics of the disks with the orientation parameters estimated from the global gas kinematics , we would conclude that in ngc 7217 the outer disk is round and the inner disk is inclined or is oval ( a destroyed bar ? ) , whereas in ngc 7742 the configuration is opposite : the inner disk is round and the outer one is oval that may be due perhaps to an external tidal perturbation .",
    "recently @xcite have studied another unbarred ringed galaxy , ngc 278 , having the morphological type close to that of ngc 7217 and ngc 7742 , sab(rs)b .",
    "their graphic presentation of the surface brightness profile of ngc 278 allows to suggest the same multi - tiers structure of the global stellar disk as we have found in ngc 7217 and ngc 7742 .",
    "all the present star formation in ngc 278 is confined to the inner disk , within the radius of 1.1 kpc , as well as in ngc 7742 .    lcccccc disk & radius range of fitting , arcsec & radius range of fitting , kpc & @xmath30 & @xmath86 & @xmath87 , arcsec & @xmath87 , kpc +   + outer & 60110 & 59 & @xmath47 & 0.82 & 35.8 & 2.9 + inner & 2050 & 1.64 &  & 0.92 & 12.5 & 1.0 + central bulge & 520 & 0.41.6 & @xmath88 & 0.88 & 3.9 & 0.3 +   + outer & 5093 & 611 & @xmath89 & 0.85 & 20 & 2.34 + inner & 1542 & 1.84.9 &  & 0.93 & 7.2 & 0.8 + central ( bulge ? ) & 15 & 0.10.6 &  & 0.93 & 1.3 & 0.15 +    some words about the central component of ngc 7742 .",
    "its rather high visible ellipticity was noted earlier , e.g. by @xcite and by @xcite ; the former authors mentioned the turn of the isophote major axis from @xmath90 to @xmath91 between @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "we confirm this result and point out that the rather high ellipticity of the isophotes at some distinct radii , namely , at @xmath94 and at @xmath95 ( fig .",
    "[ iso7742 ] ) , makes the estimate of the major axis turn quite sure .",
    "may be anyone of these elongated structures a bar or a compact triaxial bulge ?",
    "if such triaxiality exists in the center of ngc 7742 , it would cause a z - shaped disturbance of the gas velocity field ; and as we have seen in the previous section  3 , the orientation of the kinematical major axis of the gas rotation , @xmath96 , stays firmly between @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "so we do nt see any signatures of the triaxial potential in the center of ngc 7742 .",
    "instead we may suggest a strong warp of the rotation and symmetry planes in the center of the galaxy : immediately inside @xmath83 the gas rotation plane conserves the line of nodes of the outer gaseous disk but probably increases its inclination that may be deduced from the visible fast rotation , and closer to the center , at @xmath99 , the kinematical major axis of the gas ` switches ' to the ` orthogonal ' orientation @xcite .",
    "as we have noted above , two galaxies with rings and without bars ",
    "ngc 7217 and ngc 7742  have very similar global structures . as for the fine features in their centers , in this work we suggest a strong warp of the rotation plane both for the stars and for the ionized gas in the center of ngc 7742 .",

    "[ sau7217]_left _ ) obtained by measuring the emission line [ ] @xmath75007 , strong in the center of ngc 7217 , confirms the orientation of the kinematical major axis for the ionized gas found by us earlier",
    "@xcite : @xmath105 at @xmath106 .",
    "the angular rotation velocity is rather high , @xmath107 km / s / arcsec ; being compared to the stellar rotation velocity at the same radius , @xmath108 km / s / arcsec , and taking into account that @xmath109 , it implies the presence of the circumnuclear edge - on gaseous disk .",
    "the higher spatial resolution of the sauron data with respect to the previous mpfs ones allows to notice a turn of the stellar kinematical major axis inside @xmath110 , and it is a quite new finding . inside this radius",
    "the stellar kinematical major axis turns and reaches @xmath111 at @xmath55  compare to @xmath105 for the ionized gas inside @xmath60 . there is a clear impression that a _",
    "stellar _ inclined disk exists too but it is much more compact than the gaseous one . we have collected all the available velocity fields for the central part of ngc 7217 by adding to the data analysed in this work the fabry - perot ionized - gas velocity field presented by us earlier @xcite and the co velocity field presented by @xcite recently in the frame of the nuga project .",
    "we have applied the tilted - ring analysis to all of them and have traced the kinematical major axis orientation from the very center to @xmath112 . in fig .",
    "[ majax7217 ] we compare these results to the photometric major axis orientation . outside the nuclear ring , at @xmath57 , both the gas  warm and cold  and stars rotate quite axisymmetrically , with their kinematical major axes agreeing perfectly with the photometric major axis .",
    "it is somewhat strange because earlier @xcite we supposed the inner disk seen at @xmath113 to be oval because its photometric major axis , after subtracting the other structural components , deviated by some @xmath114 from the line of nodes of the outer disk",
    ". the only tentative signature of possible non - circular motions of the gas within the inner disk of ngc 7217 may be small radial velocities , of 57 km / s , detected by us in the co velocity field ; but this presence of radial gas motions is not confirmed by the results of our analysis of the ifp ionized - gas velocity field .",
    "we must note here that the ifp velocity measurements for the ionized gas of ngc 7217 were made with the weak emission line [ ] @xmath76583 and are rather noisy and patchy so perhaps we were not able to detect radial motions of less than 10 km / s .",
    "as for the stars , the inner stellar disk of ngc 7217 is not very cold @xcite , so the stars may be more stable against the weak triaxial perturbation .",
    "inside the inner ring , at @xmath115 , the kinematical major axis of the ionized gas starts to turn implying an appearance of the inclined disk . at @xmath116 the @xmath117 that differs by @xmath118 from the direction of the photometric major axis which is here at @xmath119 .",
    "the kinematical major axis of stars starts to turn much closer to the center , at @xmath50 , and at @xmath55 it reaches almost the same orientation as that of the ionized gas . so in ngc 7217 we have two circumnuclear inclined disks , gaseous and stellar , fairly coplanar to each other , but the latter is much more compact than the former .",
    "figure  [ sigma7217]_left _ presents the map of the stellar velocity dispersion in the center of ngc 7217 obtained from the sauron data .",
    "now , with the larger field of view , we can unambiguously recognize the central structure seen in this map : though the whole distribution is slightly asymmetric , in the very center there is a certain @xmath120 minimum , perhaps , shifted by @xmath121 to the north . since the color distribution derived by us from the hst / wfpc2 data is also asymmetric ,",
    "the color maximum being shifted in the opposite direction with respect to the stellar velocity dispersion minimum , we suggest that this asymmetry may be caused by the dust in the inclined circumnuclear disk .",
    "we conclude that the stellar velocity dispersion distribution is another signature of the compact circumnuclear stellar disk in this galaxy which must be a relatively ` cold ' dynamical component .",
    "by using a variety of 2d kinematical data as well as deep images of ngc 7742 , we analyse stellar and gaseous kinematics in this unbarred sb galaxy possessing the nuclear star - forming ring ; we compare it to ngc 7217 , another unbarred spiral galaxy with rings which has been studied by us earlier .",
    "we have found some common features in ngc 7217 and ngc 7742 .    1 .",
    "both galaxies demonstrate global structure consisting of two exponential stellar disks with different scalelengths ; the outer disks look quite normal whereas the inner disks are compact , with @xmath122 kpc , and have unusual high surface brightness .",
    "+ we would like to propose the following qualitative scenario to form such a ` multi - tiers ' stellar disk .",
    "a few gyrs ago there may be a sudden global gas redistribution in the disk , due perhaps to external tidal perturbation or minor merger .",
    "before that event stars should form in the disk with a large , normal scalelength , and after that when all the gas had been dropped closer to the center the star formation should continue in the disk with a smaller scalelength and higher surface density .",
    "2 .   both galaxies , ngc 7742 and ngc 7217 , have circumnuclear gaseous disks with the radius of some 300 pc , highly inclined to the global disk planes ; the outer gas disks are , on the contrary , close to the main galactic symmetry planes .",
    "both galaxies possess also some counterrotationg subsystems .",
    "ngc 7742 has all its gas in counterrotation with respect to all its stars , with exception of some newly born stellar population in the ring , while in ngc 7217 the gas outside @xmath123 pc corotates the bulk of stars , but there are some 30%  of all stars in the inner disk that counterrotates @xcite .",
    "+ three - dimensional dynamical simulations of the self - consistent evolution of a stellar - gaseous galactic disk unstable with respect to bar - like perturbations presented by @xcite proposed a scenario for the origin of circumnuclear inclined gas rings .",
    "if initially the gas of the global disk counterrotates the stars , then drifting to the center in a triaxial potential of a transient bar , this gas must leave the disk plane and accumulate on orbits strongly inclined to this plane  only these inclined orbits remain stable for the initially counterrotating gas near the inner lindblad resonances .",
    "we may suggest that the gas which is now observed as the circumnuclear strongly inclined disks in ngc 7217 and ngc 7742 has come from the outer parts of the galaxies , and when it was there , it counterrotated the stars .",
    "as for the problem of the origin of initially counterrotating gas , it may be solved together with the problem of the nuclear star - forming rings origin . if we suggest past minor merger of a dwarf gas - rich galaxy from a retrograde orbit , this event had to supply some amount of counterrotating gas and at the same time it might cause an oval distortion of the stellar disk of the host galaxy that in its turn had to produce rapid radial gas re - distribution and the nuclear star - forming ring appearance  all the peculiar features observed in ngc 7217 and ngc 7742 .",
    "ngc 7742 demonstrates strong vertical gas oscillations in its counterrotating gaseous disk implying rather recent gas accretion , ngc 7217 might possess the counterrotating gas in the past , but now it is fully reprocessed into counterrotating stars .",
    "@xcite have detected strongly peculiar kinematics of the neutral and ionized hydrogen beyond the optical stellar disk in the unbarred galaxy with the rings , ngc 278 , though the galaxy is morphologically regular and quite isolated ; they conclude that the galaxy has recently experienced a minor merger . in absence of the detailed neutral - hydrogen observations well outside the optical borders of the galaxy",
    ", one would treat ngc 278 as a twin for ngc 7217 and ngc 7742 .",
    "to our opinion , ngc 278 may represent an early stage of the evolution having followed a minor merger , with respect to two galaxies considered in our work , and its nearest future is perhaps ngc 7742 . _",
    "the presence of numerous minor merger signatures in the three unbarred galaxies with nuclear star - forming rings makes the hypothesis of tidally induced oval distortion of the global stellar disks the most attactive scenario for the ring origin in unbarred galaxies .",
