    ", we consider the nonequilibrium energy distributions of the carriers under interband photoexcitation by far- or mid - ir pumping in a wide range of the intensities .",
    "using the obtained distributions , we analyze the nonlinear dependencies of the carrier concentration and the dc conductivity on the pumping intensity and frequency at different temperatures .",
    "the dynamic conductivity of graphene photoexcited by far- or mid - ir radiation is calculated as well .",
    "as shown below , the energy distribution of carriers are determined by an interplay between quasielastic energy relaxation , which is ineffective at low energies , and generation - recombination processes .",
    "there is a marked increase in the carrier population in the range of energies where the phonon and radiative mechanisms of relaxation are virtually compensated .",
    "the interband absorption saturation also affects the energy distribution of carriers . the graphene dc conductivity as a function of the pumping intensity exhibits a pronounced nonlinearity with a sub - linear region at fairly low intensities and a saturation at a strong pumping .",
