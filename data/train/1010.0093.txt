    "interferometers have played a fundamental role in the development of experimental and theoretical physics .",
    "the classic two - slit interference experiments , the michelson - morley interferometer , the mach - zender interferometer , the hom ( hong - ou - mandel ) two - photon interferometer , all these comprise an essential set of tools in the field of quantum optics @xcite . in this paper , we show that it is possible to construct a new type of interferometer in which the beam of an incoming field is split by a qubit ( we will generically use this term to cover any dipolar - coupled two level system ) and recombined by another one .",
    "this instrument can serve for detecting the phase difference created by an object ( or in general due to any optical path difference ) placed in the path of the field propagating in one of the arms of the device .",
    "this proposal is motivated by the newest experimental advances in the field of plasmonics and superconducting circuits .",
    "superconducting two - qubit systems driven by fields have attracted a lot of interest due to their potential applications in quantum information processing ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite and references therein ) , and strong coupling between superconducting qubits and coplanar waveguide transmission lines has been achieved @xcite .",
    "recently , the resonance fluorescence spectrum of a flux qubit into such a line has been measured @xcite .",
    "strong coupling between molecules and surface plasmons is already an experimental reality @xcite , and devices such as single - photon transistors are possible with the use of nanowires @xcite . in such systems ,",
    "the main relaxation channel for the qubit is provided by the quasi one - dimensional modes ( nanowires , coplanar waveguides ) , which can be engineered such that large purcell factors are obtained @xcite .",
    "the system we consider consists of qubits coupled to different modes of the electromagnetic field ( fig . [ schematic ] ) , with the possibility of adding a phase shifts in one of the modes ( _ e.g. _ by placing a material , another off - resonant qubit , or by simply having a longer path ) .",
    "although our final results are for the case of two qubits and two modes ( which constitute an interferometer ) , we show that one can give an analytically exact description of such a quantum network in the most general case , namely @xmath0 quasi one - dimensional modes interacting with qubits placed at positions @xmath1 .",
    ", are placed at positions @xmath1 , and the field propagating in mode 2 acquires an additional phase difference @xmath2.,width=491 ]    for the photons we assume a mode - independent group velocity @xmath3 and a linear dispersion relation , which is the relevant approximation as long as the bandwidth of the system is limited around the qubits transition frequencies .",
    "we also separate the right- and left- moving photons , by introducing , for each of the @xmath0 modes indexed by @xmath4 , the corresponding field operators @xmath5 , and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 denotes the coordinate along the mode @xmath8 ) . the free - photon hamiltonian then reads @xmath9 .\\ ] ] for the qubit hamiltonian we take @xmath10 where the two levels of the qubits are denoted by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the interlevel frequency separation , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 describes the decay of the qubit @xmath17 due to other de - excitation channels than the ones provided by the modes @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "finally , for the coupling between the qubits and the modes @xmath8 we take a rotating - wave approximation hamiltonian @xmath18\\hat{\\sigma}_{10}^{(j ) } + h.c.\\ ] ] the total hamiltonian @xmath19 describes a quantum network which , as we show below , can be solved exactly .",
    "the general form of the solution of the schrdinger equation can be written as @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the vacuum of all the qubits and modes , @xmath22 s are the qubit s amplitudes , and @xmath23 are the wavefunctions of the right - and left- propagating photons .",
    "we then search for stationary solutions satisfying the time - independent schrdinger equation @xmath24 by using the parametrization @xmath25 , @xmath26 , with @xmath27    with this parametrization , the schrdinger equation results in @xmath28 and @xmath29 . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    a transparent way to obtain a solution for this system of equations is to use the method of transfer matrices .",
    "we first define amplitudes containing phase factors @xmath30 in each of the intervals between consecutive nodes , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 $ ]",
    ". then we notice that between two consecutive nodes @xmath17 and @xmath34 the fields just pick up some phase factors : it is then natural to concentrate first on the scattering process around one node @xmath17 . introducing a column vector @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 we obtain the result of scattering around the node @xmath17 in a form which generalizes previous theoretical results @xcite @xmath38 here @xmath39 is a @xmath40 matrix with 1 on the odd rows and -1 on the even rows , @xmath41 , and a useful property is @xmath42 . the quantity @xmath43 is defined as @xmath44 between two consecutive nodes @xmath17 and @xmath34 , the output amplitudes @xmath45 , @xmath46 of the node @xmath17 are related to the input amplitudes @xmath47 , @xmath48 of the node @xmath17 by @xmath49 $ ] , @xmath50 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath51 represents an additional phase accumulated in mode @xmath8 due for example to the presence of a material which modifies the speed of light .",
    "one can introduce a diagonal `` phase '' matrix @xmath52 which takes care of these effects : @xmath53\\delta_{l , s}$ ] . as a result , the amplitudes after the node @xmath34 can be obtained in the form of a product @xmath54    , @xmath55 for @xmath56 , and ( b ) the real and imaginary parts of @xmath57 ( for @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) .",

    "now we employ this general formalism for the situation in which there are only two qubits , say @xmath17 and @xmath34 .",
    "this situation is obtained by taking @xmath60 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "we also consider only two modes , @xmath64 and assume that the paths between @xmath17 and @xmath34 of the two modes are identical , @xmath65 and an additional phase difference @xmath66 is produced in the second mode .",
    "we assume a single input field @xmath67 at the input of the resulting interferometer , creating four scattered components , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 . for simplicity",
    "the qubits are presumed identical , @xmath72 .",
    "then the output amplitudes for this device are obtained as @xmath73}{4e^{i(\\varphi + 2\\theta ) } \\cos^{2}\\varphi/2 - ( 2+\\gamma ) ^{2}}a_{1}^{(j)}(x_{2}^{(j ) } ) , \\\\",

    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) demonstrates that this system behaves indeed as an interferometer , with the transmission displaying interference fringes ( @xmath78-periodicity as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath79-periodicity as a function of @xmath55 ) . for this figure we took @xmath80 , which corresponds to resonance and decay rate @xmath81 and coupling @xmath82 easily accessible experimentally @xcite .",

    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) we see that the transmission at large detunings approaches unity : this is expected , since in this case the qubits will absorb very little energy .",
