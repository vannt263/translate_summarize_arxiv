    "physicists worry a great deal about the divergences of quantum field theories : realistic theories make accurate predictions only after a mysterious process of renormalization that removes divergences . much of the motivation for new theories of elementary particles and gravity is the search for more fundamental theories which are finite .",
    "it is perhaps less appreciated among physicists that classical physics often leads to divergences ( or singularities ) as well .",
    "the laws of classical physics are encoded as partial differential equations ( pdes ) .",
    "they do not always have regular solutions , even when the boundary ( or initial ) conditions are regular .",
    "if a singularity arises , it can point to a breakdown of the theory at short distances - as it happens for the equations of elasticity @xcite . even if the theory does not break down",
    ", singularities might describe new fundamental phenomena , e.g. , black holes or shock waves , which are unimaginable in the linear approximation .",
    "thus , our understanding of a classical field theory is not complete until we know the conditions on the initial configuration under which regular solutions exist .",
    "it is not usually difficult to show the existence of weak solutions , i.e. , distribution solutions for which the equations hold when averaged by a smooth test function .",
    "however , to prove that solutions are smooth (  classical \" ) is often a very challenging mathematical problem .",
    "moreover , to show that an evolution equation has a local solution , for some finite time after the initial condition , is often much easier than to show global regularity .    even for linear equations ,",
    "the understanding of the regularity of solutions came many decades after physicists had already moved on to other matters .",
    "for example , the proof of regularity for solutions of the laplace equation needed deep developments in functional analysis , such as sobolev spaces , in the 1930s .",
    "the most celebrated open problem of regularity is the one for the navier - stokes equations of hydrodynamics .",
    "while this  millenium problem \" has resisted many attempts , there has been a great deal of recent progress in understanding the regularity of solutions for nonlinear wave equations , many of which also appear in physics .",
    "the simplest kind of nonlinear wave equation is @xmath1 where the metric @xmath2 has signature @xmath3 and @xmath4 is some polynomial .",
    "this equation follows from the variational principle with action @xmath5\\,dx\\ ] ] where the field @xmath6 takes values into an euclidean space .",
    "regular solutions for smooth initial data exist @xcite when @xmath4 is bounded below and its degree is not too large , @xmath7 the inequality is saturated when the energy is scale invariant .",
    "thus , @xmath8 is regular for spaces of dimension @xmath9 .",
    "when the dimension is larger , the theory is said to be supercritical and the solution is expected to develop singularities even for smooth initial data . for dimensions which are less than the critical one ,",
    "the proof of regularity is substantially simpler .",
    "it is interesting to note that a @xmath10 scalar quantum field theory is perturbatively renormalizable precisely when @xmath11 ( the _ spacetime _ is four dimensional ) ; i.e. , one dimension lower than the condition for the classical theory to be regular .",
    "this is the condition for the action ( not the energy ) to be scale - invariant .",
    "again , when the dimension is smaller than the critical one , the proof that the divergences of the feynman diagrams can be removed is substantially simpler : there are no primitively divergent diagrams and the theory is super - renormalizable .",
    "it is only in this case that we have a mathematically rigorous construction of quantum field theories @xcite .",
    "thus , there appears to be some deep connection between the renormalizability of quantum field theories of some given space - time dimension and the regularity of the solutions for its classical equations of motion in one dimension higher .",
    "an example of a renormalizable theory is the linear @xmath12 model @xcite with four components @xmath13 and @xmath14 the fields @xmath12 and @xmath15 represent certain particles called mesons .",
    "the @xmath12 meson is much heavier than the @xmath15 mesons , so that an approximation in which the pions are massless and the @xmath12 is infinitely heavy is reasonable . as it happens , this is the limit of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , keeping @xmath18 fixed .",
    "it turns out that this limiting process is in fact a better description of nature than the linear @xmath12 model .",
    "we observe @xmath15 mesons everyday , whereas @xmath12 mesons , if they exist at all , are very short - lived resonances .    in this limit",
    "we get the  nonlinear @xmath12 model \" for which the field is constrained to lie on a three - sphere of radius @xmath18 .",
    "if we introduce some coordinates on the sphere , the limiting equations can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the metric of the sphere and @xmath21 is the usual invariant measure in minkowski spacetime .",
    "the euler - lagrange equation of this action is called the  wave map equation \" in the mathematics literature : it is a generalization of the geodesic equation to several indepedent variables , as well as the analogue of the harmonic map equation for a domain with lorentzian signature .",
    "the nonlinear @xmath12 model is not renormalizable in four space - time dimensions ( the critical dimension of its spacetime is two ) .",
    "interestingly enough , regularity for the solutions of the wave map equation was shown in 2 + 1 dimensions @xcite .",
    "this is in keeping with our earlier observation that the critical dimension of a quantum theory is one lower than that of the classical theory .",
    "in particular , we should expect that the wave map equation in four space - time dimensions has singular solutions even for regular initial data .",
    "this has been believed by physicists for a long time , based on scaling arguments .",
    "specifically , the initial configurations that contain a  topological soliton \" evolve to a singularity in finite time .",
    "since our paper concerns a possible solution to this pathology , let us digress to explain this point further .    to have finite energy , any initial data for",
    "the wave map equation must tend to a constant at spatial infinity .",
    "identifying the points at infinity , this defines a continuous map from @xmath22 to @xmath22 .",
    "an initial configuration of topological degree not equal to zero can not be continuously deformed to a constant : it represents a new kind of excitation for the theory , fundamentally different from @xmath15 mesons , which are just infinitesimal perturbations . for small times ,",
    "such a topologically nontrivial configuration will move like a particle of finite size .",
    "it is of much interest to consruct a theory in which such topological solitons exist and are stable ( i.e. , free of singularities ) .",
    "alas , the nonlinear @xmath12 model ( the wave map equation ) is not that theory : scaling arguments show that it is possible to reduce the energy of a topologically nontrivial configuration by shrinking it .",
    "as the size goes to zero , the energy goes to zero .",
    "thus , an initial configuration of degree one should evolve in finite time to a singularity , where the degree changes discontinuously to zero .",
    "this is by now well established , indeed an explicit solution with such a singularity can be exhibited @xcite : @xmath23    but we should not give up on the wave map equation in three space dimensions entirely . the same physics that predicts the collapse of the soliton also suggests a way out :",
    "change the theory so that there is a short - distance repulsion which will halt the shrinking of the soliton at some finite size .",
    "skyrme @xcite proposed a model that has exactly this feature .",
    "he further made the revolutionary suggesstion that the topological solitons of the nonlinear @xmath12 model are atomic nuclei : the degree of the map is precisely the total number of protons and neutrons , a conserved quantity .",
    "these strange ideas have been found to be valid as an effective model @xcite of the fundamental theory of nuclear interactions , quantum chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the profound connections between the skyrme model and the topological anomalies of qcd , discovered by witten @xcite , were crucial in establishing this relation .",
    "an exact equivalence to qcd can be proved in two space - time dimensions @xcite .",
    "physics suggests that the wave map equation modified by skyrme s repulsion will have regular solutions even for initial data that are of non - zero degree .",
    "however , proving this is a difficult problem : the skyrme equation is even more nonlinear than the wave map equation .",
    "more precisely , it is no longer semilinear , but is quasilinear .",
    "this means that the coefficients of the top order terms are functions of the field , and , as a result , not even the local existence theory follows from standard theorems , but has to be proven directly .",
    "there exists however a simpler alternative to the skyrme repulsion , suggested by adkins and nappi @xcite , which leads to a semilinear equation .",
    "physically , it describes the interactions of three @xmath15 mesons with an @xmath0 vector meson field , which provides the repulsive force . scaling arguments , as well as",
    "the existence of a static solution , suggest that this equation has regular solutions even for large initial data .",
    "we thus conjecture that the adkins - nappi model is no longer supercritical , i.e. , solutions starting from finite energy smooth initial data are global in time and @xmath15 mesons is much simpler to study .",
    "it is expected that the short - distance behavior , such as singularities , are unaffected by the masses of the mesons .",
    "this is why we will study the massless limit of the adkins - nappi model . ] .    by now there is a well - established approach to proving such regularity theorems , which has worked for the wave map equation in lower dimensions . due to the fact that our equation is semilinear , we know right away that for any smooth data there exists at least a local solution",
    "first , one proves that energy does not concentrate ( i.e. , the amount of energy within a ball tends to zero as its radius goes to zero ) and that the solution remain continuous at the first possible singularity .",
    "if we can also show that small energy implies regularity , we would have achieved our goal of proving regularity .",
    "earlier @xcite we succeded in showing that a spherically symmetric ( equivariant ) solution is continuous . in this paper",
    ", we complete the first part of the above scheme by showing nonconcentration of the energy , again , in the case of a spherically symmetric solution .",
    "as time evolves , some energy is radiated away and what remains should settle into a static solution .",
    "the model we are studying is given by the action @xmath24 where :    * @xmath25 is a map from the minkowski spacetime , with @xmath26 , into the sphere @xmath27 ( with the induced riemannian metric @xmath28 ) , describing the @xmath15 mesons ; * the 1-form @xmath29 is a gauge potential representing the @xmath0 meson , while the 2-form @xmath30 is its associated electromagnetic field ; * @xmath31 is the flux or the baryonic current , i.e. , @xmath32 with @xmath33 being the levi - civita symbol and @xmath34 a normalizing constant .",
    "the first term in is the action of the nonlinear @xmath12 model , while the third one describes the coupling of the @xmath15 mesons with the vector meson .    for a field @xmath35 of finite energy , one can associate naturally its topological charge ( winding number ) @xmath36 in the adkins - nappi model , the density of the gauge potential @xmath37 coincides with the density of the topological charge @xmath38 .",
    "the object of our investigation are time dependent equivariant maps of winding number 1 associated to , i.e. , @xmath39 @xmath40 that yield the following pde for @xmath41 : @xmath42    a simple calculus shows that the energy norm @xmath43(t)=\\int_0^\\infty \\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\left(u_t^2+u_r^2\\right)+ \\frac{\\sin ^2 u}{r^2 } + \\frac{(u-\\sin u \\cos u)^2}{2r^4 } \\right]\\,r^2 dr \\label{tote}\\ ] ] is a conserved quantity if @xmath41 satisfies .    based on the fact that is a semilinear equation , for which smooth solutions exist at least locally , and @xmath41 is a radial function , we can assume , without any loss of generality , that our solution starts at time @xmath44 and develops its first singularity at @xmath45 . in this context ,",
    "our main result is    the local energy of a solution for does not concentrate : @xmath46\\ , r^2\\,dr\\,=\\,0\\label{en}\\ ] ] [ local ]    this should be compared with what we were able to prove in @xcite :    ( @xcite ) if @xmath41 satisfies , then the following local energy estimate holds @xmath47 r^2 dr = 0\\label{loce}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the standard notation for derivatives along null directions . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath41 is continuous at the origin with @xmath49 [ cont ]    the continuity argument uses only @xmath50    one notices that what we are missing in from claiming is an estimate near the cone ( i.e. , the region where @xmath51 ) for the null direction derivative @xmath52 .    in proving theorem [ cont ] , we used the conventional strategy ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) of obtaining local energy estimates by integrating differential identities over appropriate past oriented domains .",
    "these were derived in turn by multiplying with various conformal killing vector fields . however",
    ", this method does not get us quite to where we want ( i.e. , proving ) , mainly because , in our case , the energy is not critical ( scale - invariant ) , some of its terms being supercritical .",
    "this is why here we adapt a technique pioneered by grillakis @xcite , in which we work backwards in time ( i.e. , from positive times towards @xmath53 ) and take into account the behavior of @xmath41 , both on past and future oriented domains .",
    "we would still be integrating differential identities , but grillakis s method has the extra advantage of working with two apparently different expressions for the local energy : @xmath54(t)\\,&=\\ , \\int_0^ { t}\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(u_t^2+u_r^2)+\\frac{\\sin^2u}{r^2}+\\frac{(u-\\sin u",

    "they are equal because their domains form the boundary of a solid cone in spacetime .",
    "however , this equivalence gives better control on the behavior of energy on small balls .",
    "we use the framework and notation of @xcite , in which @xmath41 is assumed to be a smooth solution for in the domain @xmath56 with initial data given by @xmath57    for @xmath58 , we denote @xmath59        using the multiplier @xmath60 , where @xmath18 , @xmath61 , and @xmath34 are all functions of @xmath62 and @xmath63 , we obtain that @xmath41 satisfies : @xmath64\\bigg ) = \\left(\\frac{a_t}{2}-\\frac{\\partial_r(br^2)}{2r^2 } + c\\right ) u_{t}^2 + ( -a_r+b_t ) u_t u_r + \\left(\\frac{a_t - b_r}{2}+\\frac{b}{r } - c\\right ) u_{r}^2 \\\\ & + ( a_t + b_r)\\frac{\\sin^2u}{r^2}+\\left(a_t + r^2\\partial_r\\left(\\frac{b}{r^2}\\right)\\right)\\frac{(u-\\sin u \\cos u)^2}{2r^4 } - \\frac{\\box c}{2}u^2 + c u \\box u= i \\endaligned \\label{abc}\\ ] ]    for @xmath65 we derive the energy differential identity @xmath66 which , integrated over the interior of the cone bounded by @xmath67 and @xmath68 , justifies .",

    "as we control the energy , the flux , and the size of @xmath41 through - , the second goal would be to show that @xmath89 is uniformly bounded for @xmath58 .",
