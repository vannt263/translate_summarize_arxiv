    "the ongoing miniaturization of devices based on conventional electronics is expected to hit critical boundaries soon . to be able to further improve their performance",
    "there is a growing need of adding new functionalities or to replace segments of conventional electronics devices by new building blocks .",
    "one promising candidate that could achieve either of both is the growing field of spintronics , which has seen rapid progress over the last few years  @xcite .",
    "spintronics follows the vision to develop device building blocks operating on the basis of information encoded in the electron spin degree of freedom ; a by now classic example is the spin - field effect transistor  @xcite .",
    "recently much effort has been devoted to make use of spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) to efficiently control the spin of the electrons . in two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) formed in iii - v zinc - blende semiconductor heterostructures , two kinds of soi are dominant , namely , rashba soi due to structural inversion asymmetry  @xcite and dresselhaus soi due to bulk inversion asymmetry of the semiconductor crystal  @xcite .",
    "+ building on the results from ref .  @xcite in this article we present a systematic study of quantum transport in wires realized in 2degs with rashba and dresselhaus soi subject to an additional in - plane magnetic field whose interplay gives rise to interesting effects on the transport properties  @xcite . to this end",
    "we first introduce the system and the methods which we use for the numerical calculations in section 2 .",
    "then , in section 3 , we consider as a first step the influence of the interplay of soi and a magnetic field on the conductance and the universal conductance fluctuations ( ucfs ) of a purely one - dimensional quantum wire .",
    "we analyze the symmetries of the respective hamiltonian and numerically check the predictions from random matrix theory ( rmt ) for the conductance and the ucfs .",
    "in particular the size of the ucfs depends on the angle between the direction of the wire and the in - plane magnetic field . as a next step in section 4",
    "we relax the constraint of a purely one - dimensional quantum wire and investigate the transport properties of wires supporting several transversal modes .",
    "we find that for wires , whose width is much smaller than the spin precession length due to soi , the behaviour is similar to the one - dimensional case . before concluding with a summary of the presented results , in section 5 we put forward a detection mechanism for the relative strength of rashba and dresselhaus soi based on the angular anisotropy of the transport properties found in the preceeding sections .",
    "we investigate the transport properties of a disordered quantum wire realized in a 2deg ( @xmath1-@xmath2 plane ) , with soi subject to an in - plane magnetic field . for quantum wells grown in [ 001]-direction of iii - v semiconductors",
    "there are typically two main contributions to the soi : first the rashba soi  @xcite given by the hamiltonian @xmath3 second , the dresselhaus soi  @xcite described by the hamiltonian  @xcite : @xmath4 \\ , .\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath5 denotes the angle between the @xmath1-direction and the @xmath6$]-direction of the zinc - blende crystal and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) sets the strength of the rashba ( dresselhaus ) soi .",

    "phase - breaking occurs in the two electronic reservoirs to which the central region of length @xmath17 is connected by ideal , disorder - free leads .",
    "therefore , the length @xmath17 of the disordered , phase coherent region can be interpreted as a measure for the phase coherence length in the numerical calculations  @xcite . for those we use a discretized version of the hamiltonian  ( [ ham ] ) that allows us to evaluate the relevant transport properties of the quantum wire by computing lattice green s functions . for details on the method used , see e.g. ref .",
    "+ we denote the dimensionless parameters of the numerical calculations by a bar .",
    "real physical quantities are related to these parameters as follows : for a square lattice with spacing @xmath18 , the dimensionless energy @xmath19 is related to the real physical energy @xmath20 by @xmath21 , the magnetic field is @xmath22 , and the dimensionless soi strengths are @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in our numerical calculations we focus on local anderson disorder , i.e , we choose a random onsite potential value @xmath25 $ ] at each lattice point , with @xmath26 characterizing the strength of the disorder .",
    "the elastic mean free path for the electrons in the system is then given by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the scaled fermi energy .",

    "the transport properties we are interested in are on the one hand the conductance @xmath33 averaged over @xmath34 different disorder configurations and the size of the ucfs in terms of @xmath35 .",
    "in order to understand the soi effects appearing in narrow quantum wires of finite width  @xcite ( i.e. wires with several open transversal modes in the disorder free limit ) , it is instructive to first consider a toy model : a purely one - dimensional ( 1d ) wire , obtained from eq .",

    "although the full hamiltonian @xmath57 does not possess time - reversal symmetry , @xmath58 , seperate hamiltonians for spin up and spin down , which are both time - reversal symmetric ( for cases ( b ) and ( d ) after an additional gauge transformation ) , can be written down , since they decouple : @xmath59 due to their invariance under complex conjugation the hamiltonians @xmath60 ( for cases ( b ) and ( d ) after an additional gauge transformation ) belong to the orthogonal symmetry class , and obviously no mixing of the spins occurs . in case ( e ) however , the spin degrees of freedom mix and time reversal symmetry is broken . as a consequence @xmath57 possesses only unitary symmetry .",
    "+ those symmetries have important consequences for the transport properties of the disordered quantum wire . in rmt developed for coherent quantum transport  @xcite it was shown that systems with unitary , orthogonal and symplectic symmetry exhibit different quantum corrections to the conductance and different magnitudes of the ucfs  @xcite .",
    "although rmt gives quantitative predictions only for quantum wires with a large number of transversal modes , it can help us to understand the qualitative behaviour of both the average conductance and the ucfs for the one - dimensional quantum wire treated in this section .",
    "+ in the cases ( a)-(d ) the values of @xmath33 are similar ( showing weak localization , i.e. a negative correction to the classically expected conductance ) , while only the averaged conductance in case ( e ) is increased , both due to the mixing of the spins and due to the absence of orthogonal symmetry . since the physical systems of cases ( a)-(d ) are different , also the values of @xmath33 differ slightly , since we can not compute the quantum interference corrections to the conductance directly but only the total conductance .",

    "in the previous section we analyzed the transport properties of the toy model of a strictly 1d quantum wire and found interesting behaviour from the interplay of rashba and dresselhaus soi and an in - plane magnetic field . in this section",

    "+ in an extended 2deg with soi usually a positive correction to the classically expected conductance is found , called weak antilocalization .",
    "its appearance requires spin relaxation , which in our case is provided by the interplay between soi and scattering at impurities , which randomizes the spin state of the electrons , namely dyakonov - perel spin relaxation  @xcite .",
    "however , it was shown , that confinement can lead to a supression of spin relaxation in quantum dots  @xcite , which becomes visible as a crossover from weak antilocalization to weak localization in quantum wires upon reducing their width  @xcite .",
    "+ although , except for the special case of @xmath88 , the spin is no longer a good quantum number for a disordered quantum wire of finite width , in ref .  @xcite it was shown that the angular anisotropy in the conductance of the 1d quantum wire can also be found in wires of finite width as long as @xmath87 is still much smaller than the spin - precession lengths @xmath89 due to rashba soi and @xmath90 due to dresselhaus soi .",
