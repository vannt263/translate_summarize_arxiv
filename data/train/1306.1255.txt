    "throughout most of cosmic history , the metagalactic ionizing background evolved smoothly .",
    "the reionization of hydrogen ( @xmath4 ) and of helium ( fully ionized at @xmath5 ) were two major exceptions . during these phase transitions ,",
    "the intergalactic medium ( igm ) became mostly transparent to the relevant ionizing photons , allowing the high - energy radiation field to grow rapidly . aside from its fundamental importance as a landmark event in cosmic history , the full reionization of helium has several important consequences for the igm .",
    "since helium makes up @xmath6 per cent of the baryonic matter by mass , its ionization state significantly affects the mean free path of photons above 54.4  ev , the energy required to fully ionize helium .",
    "additionally , reionizing helium should significantly increase the temperature of the igm ( e.g. , @xcite , hereafter m09 ) .",
    "this heating may also affect galaxy formation by increasing the pressure ( and hence jeans mass ) of the gas , which may affect the star formation histories of galaxies @xcite .",
    "determining the timing and duration of this epoch is , therefore , important for understanding the evolution of the igm .    because of its large ionization potential",
    ", he  ii reionization is driven by high - energy sources : quasars and other active galactic nuclei .",
    "this process , therefore , offers an indirect probe of these populations and their distribution through space and even inside dark matter halos .",
    "for example , the metagalactic background above 54.4  ev can even be used to constrain detailed properties of the sources , such as their lifetimes and emission geometries @xcite .",
    "the study of helium reionization has some advantages over its hydrogen counterpart ( see @xcite for a review ) and may serve as an object lesson for our understanding of that earlier era .",
    "unlike for the reionization of hydrogen , we have excellent data on the state of the igm at @xmath5 , including the temperature and density distribution ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "furthermore , the main drivers of helium reionization are quasars ( due to their hard spectra ) , which are much better understood than their counterparts that drive hydrogen reionization .",
    "in particular , we know the quasar luminosity function ( qlf ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) and quasar clustering properties ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "given the rarity of these sources and the inhomogeneity of the igm , the process of helium reionization is expected to be patchy .",
    "this patchiness has important implications for the evolution of the igm , and it is one of the crucial elements that must be modeled correctly .",
    "many measurements make assumptions about the uv - background radiation and the temperature - density relation , ignoring the inhomogeneity and timing of he  ii reionization .",
    "quantifying the expected spread in he  ii ionization states is crucial .",
    "recent and ongoing high - resolution measurements of the he  ii lyman-@xmath0 ( ly@xmath0 ) forest have started to test this picture .",
    "@xcite showed that early data indicated a rapid decrease in the optical depth with cosmic time at @xmath7 , which may be indicative of he  ii reionization , while @xcite showed that the large fluctuations observed in the optical depth were most likely indicative of ongoing reionization at @xmath8 .",
    "now , the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ is providing an even more powerful probe of the the igm at @xmath9 .",
    "the he  ii optical depth along the explored sightlines varies significantly at @xmath10 and generally increases rapidly at higher redshift @xcite .",
    "four lines of sight also show significant variation in the he  ii ly@xmath11 optical depth @xcite .",
    "this large set of observations  and our detailed knowledge of the source populations and igm at @xmath5  make a detailed study of the he  ii reionization process very timely .",
    "since quasars are rare , the ionizing background should exhibit significant fluctuations even after reionization is complete @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , the he  ii ly@xmath0 forest measurements provide some direct evidence for this behavior @xcite .",
    "additionally , radiative transfer through the clumpy igm can induce additional fluctuations @xcite . during reionization , fluctuations in the uv radiation background are even greater , because some regions receive strong ionizing radiation while others remain singly ionized with no local illumination .    during the past decade",
    ", the reionization of helium and its impact on the igm has received increased theoretical attention through a variety of methods .",
    "both large - scale structures ( spanning @xmath12  gpc comoving scales ) , given the rarity of quasars and their clustering properties , and the small scales of gas physics play a significant role in fully understanding this epoch , but accounting for both simultaneously is computationally challenging .",
    "since this epoch is observationally constrained in a way that hydrogen reionization is not , a viable model conforms to these observations , such as the igm density and temperature .",
    "several studies employ various combinations of analytic , semi - analytic , and monte carlo methods ( e.g. , @xcite ) to approximate the morphology of ionized helium bubbles , heating of the igm , he - ionizing background , etc .",
    "none of these methods can comprehensively include all relevant physics , especially spatial information like source clustering .",
    "many numerical simulations of this epoch focus on scales @xmath13 comoving mpc@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "these simulations miss the large ionized bubbles expected during helium reionization and fail to include many sources . m09",
    "present large ( hundreds of mpc ) @xmath15-body simulations with cosmological radiative transfer as a post - processing step .",
    "note that m09 consider two classes of quasar models and vary the timing of reionization independently .",
    "one major modeling hurdle is the implementation of quasars .",
    "the aggregate , empirical properties of quasars are well constrained with the qlf measured over a range of redshifts and to low optical luminosities ( see @xcite ) . the spectral energy distribution is more uncertain and varies significantly from quasar to quasar ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the lifetime of quasars ( e.g. , @xcite ) and their relation to dark matter halos ( e.g. , @xcite ) are far from settled .",
    "the challenge is to satisfy the observed quantities while allowing for a range of possibilities for the more uncertain aspects .    to complement these numeric and analytic studies , here we present fast , semi - numeric methods that incorporate realistic source geometries to explore a large parameter space .",
    "we adapt the established hydrogen reionization code dexm @xcite to the @xmath3 era , as appropriate for helium .",
    "the code applies approximate but efficient methods to produce dark matter halo distributions . using analytic arguments ,",
    "ionization maps are generated from these distributions .",
    "the advantages of this approach are speed , as compared to cosmological simulations , and reasonably accurate spatial information ( like halo clustering and a detailed , local density field ) , as compared to more analytic studies .",
    "we investigate a wide range of quasar properties .",
    "these simulations are well - suited to study many features of the helium reionization epoch , including interpreting the he  ii ly@xmath0 forest and estimating the he - ionizing background . in this paper",
    ", we consider the spatial morphology of he  ii reionization and the he  ii photoionization rate during and after reionization .",
    "given our ability to span a large parameter space , we aim to pinpoint the assumptions that most strongly impact the results and to evaluate the effect of various uncertainties .",
    "we use semi - numeric methods , outlined in ",
    "[ sec : dexm ] , to approximate the ionization morphology , density field , and sources of ionizing photons at @xmath3 . as a second layer ,",
    "we place empirically determined active quasars in dark matter halos , following several prescriptions in  [ sec : qso ] . with these inputs ,",
    "we determine the he  ii photoionization rate for post - reionization and several he  ii fractions in  [ sec : gamma ] . in ",
    "[ sec : hydrogen ] , we compare our results and methods with those for hydrogen reionization .",
    "we conclude in  [ sec : disc ] .    in our calculations , we assume a cosmology with @xmath16  km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 ) ( with @xmath18 = 0.74 ) , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 . unless otherwise noted all distance quoted are in comoving units .",
    "to fully describe helium reionization and compute the detailed features of the ly@xmath0 forest , complex hydrodynamical simulations of the igm , including radiative transfer effects and an inhomogeneous background , are required .",
    "recent @xmath15-body simulations ( e.g. , m09 ) have advanced both in scale and in the inclusion of relevant physical processes .",
    "however , the major limitation is the enormous dynamic range , balancing large ionized regions with small - scale physics , required to model reionization .",
    "generally , this problem is solved in two ways .",
    "first , most codes follow only the dark matter , assuming that the baryonic component traces it according to some simplified prescription .",
    "they then perform radiative transfer on the dark matter field ( perhaps with some modifications to reflect baryonic smoothing ) .",
    "second , these codes add in the ionizing sources through post - processing , rather than through a self - consistent treatment of galaxy and black hole formation , which is not substantially better than simple analytic models .",
    "also importantly , large simulations remain computationally intensive , limiting the range of parameter space that can be explored in a reasonable amount of time .",
    "we adapt the semi - numeric code dexm @xcite , originally designed to model hydrogen reionization at @xmath21 , for lower redshifts and for helium reionization .",
    "this code provides a relatively fast semi - numeric approximation to more complicated treatments but remains fairly accurate on moderate and large scales . for full details , see @xcite . in brief",
    ", we create a box with length @xmath22  mpc on each side , populated with dark matter halos determined by the density field .",
    "given these halos , we generate a two - phase ( singly and fully ionized ) ionization field , where the he  iii fraction is fixed by some efficiency parameter using a photon - counting method . for our high - level calculations ,",
    "we additionally adjust the local density field to match recent hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "there are drawbacks to our approach , of course .",
    "for one , this semi - numeric method does not follow the progression of he  ii reionization through a single realization of that process . in order to ensure accurate redshift evolution ,",
    "photon conservation requires a sharp @xmath23-space filter , whereas we use a real - space , top - hat filter , applied to the linear density field ( see the appendix of @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this filtering can result in  ringing \" artifacts from the wings of the filter response , in the limit of a rare source population ( as is the case in he  ii reionization ) .",
    "moreover , during he  ii reionization , the relevant ionizing sources are short - lived quasars .",
    "when a source shuts off , the surrounding regions can begin to recombine in a complex fashion @xcite .",
    "our method does not explicitly follow these recombinations , as we will discuss below . as a consequence ,",
    "we perform all of our calculations at @xmath3 , near the expected midpoint of the he  ii reionization according to current measurements .",
    "we expect our results to change only modestly throughout the redshift range @xmath24 , because the source density does not change significantly over this range and the igm density field evolution is similarly limited .",
    "our primary concern in adapting dexm to this period , as compared to the higher redshift regime for which it has been carefully tested , is the increasing nonlinearity of the density field .",
    "there are two possible problems .",
    "first , the dramatically larger halo abundance may lead to overlap issues with the halo - finding algorithm .",
    "second , the igm density field will have modest nonlinearities representing the cosmic web .",
    "we will address the latter problem in detail in ",
    "[ sec : density ] .",
    "the backbone of our method is the dark matter halo distribution . in a similar way to @xmath15-body codes",
    ", we generate a 3d monte - carlo realization of a linear density field on a box with @xmath25 grid cells ( @xmath22  mpc ) .",
    "this density field is evolved using the standard zeldovich approximation @xcite .",
    "dark matter halos are identified from the evolved density field using the standard excursion set procedure .",
    "starting on the largest scale ( the box size ) and then decreasing , the density field is smoothed using a real - space top hat filter at each point .",
    "once the smoothed density exceeds some mass - dependent critical value , the point is associated with a halo of the corresponding mass .",
    "each point is assigned to the most massive halo possible , and halos can not overlap .",
    "we choose our critical overdensity to match the halo mass function found in the @xcite simulations at @xmath3 , following the fitting procedure of @xcite .",
    "the final halo locations are shifted from their initial ( lagrangian ) positions to their evolved ( eulerian ) positions using first - order perturbation theory @xcite . to optimize memory use , we resolve the velocity field used in this approximation onto a lower - resolution , 500@xmath14 grid .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mass_func ] displays the resultant mass function as points , where the dashed line is the sheth - tormen @xcite result with @xcite parameters and the dotted line is the press - schechter analytic solution for the mass function @xcite .",
    "we successfully reproduce the former mass function and , therefore , match large numerical simulations .",
    "the right panel shows our halo power spectrum , defined as @xmath26 . here",
    ", @xmath27 is the collapsed mass field , and the volume @xmath28 .",
    "also shown is the prediction from the halo model , which is a semi - analytic method for describing nonlinear gravitational clustering .",
    "this model matches many statistical properties of large simulations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , all dark matter is assumed to be bound in halos of varying sizes ; then , given prescriptions for the distribution of dark matter within halos and the number and spatial distribution of halos , many large - scale statistical properties of dark matter can be calculated , including the halo power spectrum . at small scales ,",
    "the measured power spectrum diverges from the halo - model equivalent , most likely because we do not include halo density profiles that would dominate at these scales .",
    "note that the halos with which we are concerned are the most massive at @xmath3 , containing only a few percent of the total mass .",
    "this fact means that overlap between mass filters is not very important , as it might be at lower masses : when a large fraction of the mass is contained inside collapsed objects , the halo filters could then overlap , in which case the ordering at which the cells were examined would affect the halo distribution and bias our results @xcite .",
    "fortunately , because we are concerned with quasars inside very massive dark matter halos , we avoid this issue .",
    "this focus on large halos also accounts for the large difference between the sheth - tormen and press - schechter mass functions in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass_func ] .",
    "because we focus on helium reionization , quasars are the relevant ionizing source .",
    "empirically , quasar properties are reasonably well constrained : the quasar luminosity function ( qlf ) has been measured to low optical luminosities over a range of redshifts ( see the compilation in @xcite )",
    ". however , the spectral energy distribution  and hence the transformation of this observed luminosity function to the energies of interest to us  is more uncertain .",
    "furthermore , the relation between quasars and their host dark matter halos is not settled ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these details affect the ionization maps , the photoionization rate , and the pertinent range of the halo mass function via the minimum mass .",
    "given these factors , there is no standard approach to the inclusion of quasars in numeric and analytic models . to address this uncertain relationship , we considered a wide range of models that encompass the spectrum of popular theories .",
    "given the distribution of dark matter halos found in the previous section , only the halos that host or have hosted quasars contribute to the ionization field .",
    "we begin by assuming that each halo above a minimum mass @xmath29 is eligible to host a quasar and that a fraction @xmath30 actually have hosted one ( at either the present time or at some time in the past ) .",
    "thus , these are the relevant sources for the ionization field calculation . as a fiducial value ,",
    "we take @xmath31  .",
    "next , we assume that these hosts produce @xmath32 he  ii - ionizing photons per helium atom , where we have split this quantity into two factors for conceptional convenience .",
    "the first ( @xmath33 ) is the _ average _ number of ionizing photons ( minus recombinations , see below ) across the entire source population , while we will use the latter ( @xmath34 ) to describe how these photons are distributed amongst the hosts ( i.e. , it may vary with halo mass ) .",
    "if we then consider a region in which all the ionizing photons are produced by interior sources ( and inside of which all of those photons are absorbed ) , the ionized fraction @xmath35 is then @xmath36 where the @xmath34 factor has vanished because we are only considering the _ total _ population ( summed over all masses , so that the ionizing efficiency is simply the average value @xmath33 ) .",
    "the efficiency parameter @xmath33 can be estimated from first principles given a model for quasars ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one could compute the average number of he  ii ionizations per baryon inside of quasars ( @xmath37 ) , estimate the efficiency with which baryons are incorporated into the source black holes ( @xmath38 ) , and estimate the fraction of these photons that escape their host ( @xmath39 ) ; then @xmath40 , with additional corrections for the composition of the igm and the number of photons  wasted \" through recombinations .",
    "however , we note that @xmath33 _ can not _",
    "be inferred directly from the observed luminosity function , because it depends on the total number of ionizing photons emitted by a halo rather than the current luminosity . at minimum",
    ", we would require knowledge of the lifetime of the luminous phase of the quasar emission .",
    "conversely , this implies that our choices for @xmath29 and @xmath41 enforce a quasar lifetime , which we will consider in ",
    "[ sec : qso ] .",
    "this @xmath33 also depends on the recombination history of the igm , as ( to the extent that they are uniform ) such recombinations essentially cancel out some of the earlier ionizations @xcite . in practice ,",
    "recombinations are inhomogeneous and so much more complex to incorporate @xcite , especially because the small number of quasar sources can allow some regions to recombine substantially before being ionized again by a new quasar @xcite .",
    "our @xmath41 parameter can approximately account for the latter effect ( if one thinks of some of the  off \" halos as having hosted quasars so long in the past that their bubbles have recombined ) .",
    "we also expect that inhomogeneous recombinations are relatively unimportant for the quasar case , at least until the late stages of reionization @xcite .",
    "because we lack a strong motivation for a particular value of @xmath33 , we will generally use it as a normalization constant .",
    "that is , we will specify @xmath42  and a model for the host properties ( @xmath29 and @xmath41 ) , and then choose @xmath33 to make eq .",
    "( [ eq : basic_one ] ) true .",
    "as described above , any such choice can be made consistent with the luminosity function if we allow the quasar lifetime to vary .    throughout most of the paper ,",
    "we consider two basic source models . neither is meant to be a detailed representation of reality : instead , they take crude , but contrasting , physical pictures meant to bracket the real possibilities . in the first ,",
    "our _ fiducial method _ , we imagine that some quasars existed long enough ago that any he  iii ions they created have since recombined , so only a fraction of the halos ( which recently hosted quasars ) contribute to the ionization field .",
    "we therefore assume that during reionization ( 1 ) only a fraction @xmath41 of halos above @xmath43 have ever hosted sources , and that ( 2 ) each halo with a source , regardless of its mass , produces the same total number of ionizing photons .",
    "the latter assumption effectively fixes our @xmath34 parameter , which must vary inversely with mass .",
    "we are left with two free parameters , @xmath41 and @xmath33 .",
    "for the first , we set @xmath44 as the fraction of halos that contain sources , where @xmath45 is the ( assumed ) _ total _ number of ionizing photons produced per helium atom ( integrated over all past times ) .",
    "physically , this means that at the moment the universe becomes fully ionized we would have @xmath46 . in this case , the other halos would have had ionizing sources so far in the past that their he  iii regions have recombined since formation .",
    "since we loosely assume @xmath3 to be the midpoint of helium reionization , we then fix @xmath33 so as to produce @xmath42  = 0.5 with @xmath47 , where @xmath48 as expected at @xmath3 .",
    "this efficiency effectively determines the size of each ionized bubble : thus , their number density and size together fix the net ionized fraction .",
    "to set other ionized fractions , @xmath41 is varied , where intuitively more sources produce more ionizations .    in detail",
    ", these parameters can not generally be set by analytic arguments , as the total ionized fraction depends on the numerical method as well ( because our algorithm does not conserve or track individual photons ) . a final adjustment ( of order unity )",
    "is necessary in order to reproduce the proper he  iii fraction .",
    "( hence , @xmath44 above is not a strict equality . )",
    "thus , the physical parameters that motivate each realization should be taken only as rough guides to the underlying source populations .    our second source model ( which we will refer to as the _ abundant - source method _ )",
    "is chosen primarily as a contrast to this fiducial one .",
    "we assume that ( 1 ) all halos above @xmath43 have hosted sources , even when the global @xmath42  is small , and that ( 2 ) the ionizing efficiency of each halo is proportional to its mass ( which demands that @xmath49 ) .",
    "these assumptions mean that ( when averaged over large scales ) the quantity @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : basic_one ] ) reduces to the simple form @xmath51 ( the same form typically used for hydrogen reionization ; @xcite ) .",
    "we then choose @xmath33 to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : basic_one ] ) for a specified @xmath42 .",
    "neither of these approaches is entirely satisfactory , but they bracket the range of plausible models reasonably well and so provide a useful gauge of the robustness of our predictions .",
    "our fiducial model fails to match naive expectations in two ways .",
    "first , it assumes that only a fraction of massive halos host black holes that have ionized their surroundings .",
    "one possible interpretation is that some of these sources appeared long ago , so that their ionized bubbles have recombined .",
    "however , in most cases the required number of recombinations would be much larger than expected @xcite .",
    "a simpler interpretation is that many of these halos simply lack black holes .",
    "while this fails to match observations in the local universe ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , the situation at @xmath5 is less clear , and it is possible that many massive halos have not yet formed their black holes .    on the other hand , this procedure does allow our calculations to crudely describe the evolution of the he  iii field with redshift , even though the calculations are all performed at @xmath52 . the primary difference between our density field and one at , say @xmath53 , is the decreased halo abundance in the latter . assuming that @xmath54 , therefore , roughly approximates the halo field at this higher redshift ( though , of course , it does not properly reproduce their spatial correlations , etc . ) .",
    "a second problem with our fiducial model is that , by assuming that each halo produces the _ same _ number of ionizing photons , the resulting black holes will likely not reproduce the well - known @xmath55@xmath56 relation between halo and black hole properties @xcite .",
    "our choice is motivated by two factors .",
    "first , any scatter in the high - redshift black hole mass - halo mass relation ( as is likely if these halos are still assembling rapidly ) may dominate the steep halo mass distribution .",
    "second , some models predict a characteristic halo mass for quasar activity @xcite . in practice , this inconsistency is probably not an enormous problem , because our high mass threshold ( and the resulting steep mass function shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass_func ] ) means that only a fairly narrow range of halos contribute substantially .    the abundant - source method at least qualitatively reproduces the relation between halo mass and black hole mass ( and the expected ubiquity of quasars ) , but it leads to some other unexpected features .",
    "most importantly , it demands that the ionized bubbles around many quasars be quite small when @xmath42  @xmath57 , as we will show later .",
    "partly , this is because we work at @xmath52 , where the number of massive halos is rather large . at higher",
    "redshift , an identical prescription would find fewer sources , which would allow for larger individual bubbles . moreover , the characteristic luminosity of quasars does not vary dramatically throughout the helium reionization epoch , so we naturally expect that the average bubble size will also remain roughly constant ( m09 ) .",
    "instead , in our calculations within this model , the assumed efficiency parameter @xmath33 varies with @xmath42  while the source distribution remains fixed .",
    "thus , our sequence of ionized fractions should _ not _ be viewed as a sequence over time in the abundant - source model , as we do not allow the halo field to evolve .",
    "one could view the small sizes of the bubbles when @xmath42  @xmath57 as a result of strong  internal absorption \" within the bubbles , which would keep them compact , but that does not seem a likely scenario @xcite .    nevertheless , it is useful to consider a contrasting case from our fiducial model , in which reionization proceeds not by generating more he  iii regions but by growing those that do exist .",
    "our abundant - source model provides just such a contrast and so is useful as a qualitative guide to the importance of the source prescription .      with the ionizing source model and the dark matter halo distribution in hand ,",
    "we determine which areas of our box are fully ionized and which are not . to find the he  iii field , dexm uses a filtering procedure similar to that outlined  [ sec : halos ] . in particular , he  iii regions are associated with large - scale overdensities in the ionizing source distribution .",
    "thus , instead of comparing the evolved igm density to some critical value as in ",
    "[ sec : halos ] , we consider the density of our sources ( or , equivalently , of dark matter halos ) . in the fiducial model ,",
    "we let @xmath58 be the total number of halos that have hosted sources inside a region of radius @xmath59 and mass @xmath55 centered at a point * x*. then , this region is fully ionized if @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the average mass of halos containing sources .",
    "first , the source field is smoothed to a lower resolution ( @xmath62 grid cells ) to speed up the ionized bubble search procedure , which takes considerable time at high ionized fractions relative to the other components of the code .",
    "we then filter this source field using a real - space , top - hat filter , starting at a ( mostly irrelevant ) large scale @xmath63 and decreasing down to the cell size .",
    "every region satisfying eq .",
    "( [ eq : zeta_bub ] ) at each filtering scale is flagged as a he  iii bubble , regardless of overlap ( unlike the halo - finding case ) .",
    "the result is a two - phase map of the ionization field , dependent on the number density of halos hosting ionizing sources .",
    "the assumption of two phases with sharp edges is clearly a simplification .",
    "one - dimensional radiative transfer codes show that the  transition region , \" or distance between fully ionized and singly ionized helium zones , is typically a few mpc thick  more precisely , the radius over which the he  iii fraction falls from @xmath64 to @xmath65 is @xmath66 per cent of the size of the fully ionized zone ( f. davies , private communication ; see also fig .",
    "19 of m09 )",
    ". the relatively late timing of he  ii reionization , the rarity of the ionizing sources , and the hard spectra of quasars are responsible for widening this region . in many applications , especially those involving the igm temperature ,",
    "this transition region is very important .",
    "however , for other applications  such as the he  ii ly@xmath0 forest  the two - phase approximation is adequate , because even a small he  ii fraction renders a gas parcel nearly opaque .",
    "most he  iii regions are very large ( many tens of mpc across ) , where many are built through the overlap of bubbles from individual sources , so the relatively narrow transition regions do not dominate the ionization topology .",
    "nevertheless , we must bear in mind this important simplification when applying our semi - numeric simulations to observables .    in the ionization field slices shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bub_slices ] , we see the increasing ionized fraction through a static universe for the fiducial method . displayed in the figure are @xmath42  = 0.20 , 0.50 , 0.80 , and 0.90 , corresponding to @xmath67 and 0.560 .",
    "the map is fairly bubbly in nature with noticeable clustering .",
    "the fact that a pixel residing in a bubble has an increased likelihood of being near another bubble has important consequences for our later calculations . even at the highest @xmath42  displayed , there are large  neutral \" sections .",
    "note the periodic boundary conditions .    a similar procedure works for our abundant - source model , except the mass - weighting of the ionization efficiency per halo means that the relevant quantity is the total collapse fraction ( @xmath68 ) . in this case , the ionization criterion becomes very simple : @xmath69 as mentioned in the previous section , this model results in small ionized bubbles that increase in size as @xmath42  increases , with the highest fractions exhibiting very similar morphology to the fiducial model .",
    "note that most large - scale applications should be fairly insensitive to the presence of small bubbles , since the radiation background is dominated by the brightest quasars within fully ionized regions .    beyond our two main methods ,",
    "we consider some additional parameter choices , shown in fig .",

    "we explore a range of minimum halo mass ( effectively changing the quasar lifetime ) for the abundant - source method . from left to right , @xmath70 at @xmath42  @xmath71 .",
    "as @xmath72 is decreased , the number of sources increases , which implies that the quasar is  turned on \" for a shorter period of time , ionizing a smaller region given a fixed @xmath42 .",

    "the  morphology \" of reionization ( i.e. , the distribution of ionized bubble sizes ) is often taken as a key observable of the h  1 process , because the huge number of sources closely connects it to the underlying dark matter field . in the he  ii case , however , the small numbers of sources make that connection mostly uninteresting : poisson fluctuations instead play a key role @xcite , and the distribution of bubbles relative to halos is much more likely to tell us about the details of the black hole - host relation than it is the fundamentals of the reionization process .",
    "quantitatively , there is little evolution in the shape of the power spectrum of the ionized fraction throughout helium reionization .",
    "additionally , because there are so many sources inside each h  ii region , the ionizing background remains large at all times , preventing these bubbles from recombining substantially .",
    "when only one or two ( short - lived ) sources occupy each bubble , however , recombinations can substantially increase the he  ii fraction inside even regions that are nominally fully ionized @xcite .",
    "fortunately , fig .",
    "[ fig : fg_io ] shows that most such regions will be illuminated , at least late in the process .",
    "but this will , for example , increase the opacity of some he  iii bubbles in the ly@xmath0 forest ( and to ionizing photons ) .",
    "we have crudely modeled this effect through our source prescriptions ( one can regard turning some halos  off \" as instead allowing their ionized bubbles to recombine fully ) .",
    "our approach to describing the ionizing sources themselves is also rather different .",
    "the lack of data on high - redshift galaxies so far implies that naive prescriptions ( with a constant ionizing efficiency per halo , or at most a systematic variation with halo mass ) are more than adequate . on the other hand ,",
    "the tight observational constraints on the qlf at @xmath5 require that it be directly incorporated into the calculation .",
    "this inclusion is easy to do for the instantaneous ionization rate but much harder for the cumulative number of ionizing photons , because the relationship between the visible sources and their dark matter halo hosts and the light curves of individual quasars remains uncertain .",
    "we have shown that the details of this association do not strongly affect many properties of reionization ( such as the distribution of @xmath107 ) , but they will show up in other observables .",
    "for example , one could imagine searching for massive halos inside of large he  iii regions in order to identify the descendants of bright quasar hosts .",
    "a final key difference is the source spectrum , which is unimportant for stellar sources but crucial for the quasars responsible for he  ii reionization . although we have ignored the resulting partially ionized transition zones , we have included these spectra explicitly in evaluating the ionizing background .",
    "we are thus able to track the growth of a hard background in he  ii regions , an effect likely to be much less important during h  ii reionization @xcite .",
    "we have introduced a new and efficient semi - numeric method for efficiently generating dark matter halo distributions and ionization maps relevant to the full reionization of helium . specifically , we adapted an existing hydrogen reionization code ( dexm ) to identify halos at lower redshift and changed the method for determining the ionization state to suit quasars as sources .",
    "the speed of our algorithm allows exploration of a wide range of possible quasar models not only for active quasars , but in the realization of the ionization map as well .",
    "our results broadly match previous simulations of related quantities , at least statistically speaking .",
    "we generated accurate halo mass functions as compared to @xmath15-body simulations .",
    "this congruence is important for determining the effect of quasar clustering .",
    "we also reproduced the he  iii morphology , especially at high @xmath42 , as demonstrated by the ionized power spectra , which compare favorably with m09 ( modulo our different source prescriptions ) .",
    "we demonstrated that this method can easily produce simulation volumes hundreds of mpc across to accurately capture the large - scale features of helium reionization .",
    "we also constructed a density field that matches ( by design ) the smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of bb09 .",
    "a realistic density field is crucial to capturing at least some of the small - scale fluctuations in the observable quantities , which is lacking in semi - analytic models .",
    "we have presented the first systematic study of fluctuations in the ionizing background during reionization .",
    "our @xmath164 exhibit significant variation even post - reionization , in excellent agreement with analytic calculations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we calculate the more relevant @xmath164 as opposed to @xmath148 in the analytic case .",
    "we demonstrated that complications like a frequency - dependent mean free path and quasar clustering do not significantly affect the result in this regime .",
    "we also find that a broader and bimodal distribution develops during reionization .",
    "this distribution differs from that during the hydrogen reionization era @xcite and from analytic predictions for the he  iii era @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations have important consequences , which we can quantify , for many observables , including the quasar spectra metal lines and igm heating . in an upcoming paper",
    ", we will study the impact of these fluctuations on the he  ii ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "the most important conclusion is that not every part of the igm experienced the same reionization history or receives the same background radiation .",
    "we included a frequency - varying mean free path , another crucial improvement on semi - analytic models .",
    "this frequency - dependent spectrum gives rise to the bimodal nature of @xmath164 we find during reionization .",
    "specifically , hard photons can travel farther and escape into the he  ii regions , creating a low - level background there .",
    "this frequency - dependence is important for studies of the he  ii ly@xmath0 forest , metal lines , and igm heating .",
    "there are some important caveats to our methods :    ( _ i _ ) we assign the quasars a simple  though frequency - dependent  mean free path with an uncertain normalization .",
    "this assumption ignores detailed radiative transfer effects and is important both during and after reionization .",
    "in particular , we _ prescribe _ the normalization of this mean free path , rather than allowing it to vary with the local radiation field @xcite .",
    "( _ ii _ ) we assume a two - phase medium . in principle , our ionized bubble edges should not be abrupt , especially since helium recombines so quickly , but instead transition smoothly from fully ionized to singly ionized .",
    "this effect is less important during the late stages of reionization as the bubbles increasingly overlap ( so that the ratio of their volume to their surface area decreases ) .",
    "( _ iii _ ) we do not fully account for recombinations .",
    "as mentioned above , we do not explicitly include any he  ii inside ionized bubbles , though likely some he  iii would have recombined .",
    "not only would this affect our effective mean free path ( as determined by @xmath149 ) , we do not compensate for ionizing photons being  wasted \" on reionizing this gas when generating our ionization maps .",
    "iv _ ) our simulations assume that quasars emit radiation isotropically .",
    "many theoretical models pertaining to quasar behavior predict otherwise . although this effect is important during the early stages of reionization , once each ionized bubble contains ( or has contained ) multiple , randomly oriented quasars , beaming is no longer important .",
    "our conclusions are mostly insensitive to our underlying assumptions for active quasars and ionizing sources . for our wide range of explored models , the resultant @xmath164 varied minimally , except for @xmath130 .",
    "in particular , quasar clustering is a secondary effect , and a few rare , bright quasars dominate the spectrum . although this makes our predictions robust , distinguishing between our models using observational data dependent on the ionizing background would be difficult if not impossible .    with the ionization maps , density field , and active quasar models , we are uniquely suited to study fluctuations in the he",
    "ii ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "in particular , we maintain spatial information that is important for considering correlations along a line of sight .",
    "we explore these fluctuations in an upcoming paper @xcite , where we show that the large variations in transmission indicate ongoing reionization at @xmath165 .",
    "similarly , these methods could apply to the he  ii lyman-@xmath11 forest , as measured by @xcite .",
    "further applications that we intend to explore are the transverse proximity effect , as measured in the he  ii ly@xmath0 forest @xcite , whereby a quasar near another line of sight enhances the ionizing background .",
    "the size and nature of the apparent influence of the ly@xmath0 spectra may give important clues about the intrinsic properties of quasars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "also , the spatial inhomogeneities of the uv radiation background should affect the ionization balance of the metals in the igm .",
    "as an example , there may be a break in the ratio of c  iv to si  iv at @xmath5 indicating helium reionization ( @xcite , though see @xcite ) .",
    "the fluctuations we find in our he - ionizing background could have important consequences for these measurements .",
    "combining past and upcoming observations with our theoretical tools will shed light not only on the timing and duration the helium reionization epoch , but also the nature of the igm and the properties of quasars .",
