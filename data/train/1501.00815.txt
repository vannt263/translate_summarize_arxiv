    "luminous dust - obscured quasars have been postulated to represent the missing evolutionary link between merger - induced starburst galaxies and ultraviolet ( uv ) bright quasars @xcite in theoretical models of galaxy formation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "samples of obscured active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have been selected both in the hard x - ray ( e.g. @xcite ) and the mid - infrared ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , these surveys do not distinguish between a centrally concentrated obscuring medium , on parsec scales , close to the black - hole accretion disk @xcite , and larger - scale obscuration due to gas and dust clouds in the quasar host galaxy @xcite .",
    "most hard x - ray and mid - infrared surveys ( e.g. with the _ spitzer _ space telescope ) have covered relatively small areas of sky , probing obscured black - hole growth in relatively low - luminosity agn , although the situation is now changing at mid infrared wavelengths with data from the _ wise _ all - sky survey @xcite . in these faint samples ,",
    "the number of obscured agn is found to decrease with increasing luminosity .",
    "constraints on obscured black - hole growth at the highest quasar luminosities however remain highly uncertain and the relationship between hyperluminous ( @xmath20l@xmath4 ) obscured quasars and the now well - studied obscured agn at low luminosities is also uncertain .",
    "x - ray surveys also show a curious lack of high eddington ratio ( @xmath21 ) objects with n@xmath22 between 3@xmath2310@xmath24 and 3@xmath2310@xmath25 @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "objects with such properties , i.e. high luminosity combined with a significant gas / dust column , could possess massive agn - driven outflows .",
    "the apparent upper limit to the distribution of eddington ratios could be a selection bias , as most x - ray surveys do not cover a large enough area to detect the rarest and brightest quasars with high eddington ratios .",
    "such objects have traditionally been selected through their rest - frame uv emission which is very sensitive to dust extinction and therefore biased against detecting luminous quasars with even moderate gas column densities . the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss )",
    "data release ( dr ) 7 quasar sample @xcite now mitigates the situation to a degree .",
    "the flux limit in the redder @xmath27-band allows some intrinsically very luminous objects with @xmath280.5 to be included @xcite .",
    "the new sdss - iii boss dr10 quasar survey @xcite reaches fainter optical magnitudes than the sdss and has significantly increased the number of quasars known at the main epoch of galaxy formation at @xmath29 .",
    "populations of red quasars are detected in the boss data @xcite including the first large sample of narrow - line type 2 obscured quasars at high redshifts @xcite , some of which also show evidence for broad - lines in the near infrared @xcite . however , even with the fainter flux - limit , boss can not find quasars with @xmath30 .",
    "wide - field infrared surveys now cover much of the observable sky , providing the sensitivity to detect dusty , intrinsically luminous , broad - line quasars .",
    "the 2mass survey has identified optically obscured quasars that are also radio - loud ( e.g. @xcite ) ; the radio selection using first data is necessary to eliminate contaminant populations but means that the majority of agn are excluded by the selection . in radio - loud red quasars ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ", the red colours can arise as a result of the presence of a red synchrotron component @xcite rather than due to dust .",
    "the flux - limit of the 2mass survey has also meant that these red quasars are predominantly at low - redshift although with some of the most luminous quasars seen out to @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "a concern at low - redshifts is that host galaxy contamination can redden the observed colours of these quasars . the galaxy spectral energy distribution ( sed ) peaks at @xmath61@xmath12 m , corresponding to the inflection point in the agn sed .",
    "this feature is in the nir @xmath31 filters at @xmath32 .",
    "however , at @xmath330.7 , the first-2mass red quasars are seen to be associated with merging galaxy hosts @xcite , consistent with an interpretation where the objects are in a transition phase from starburst to unobscured quasar . extending these investigations to focus on the main epoch of galaxy and black - hole formation at @xmath34 will be in instructive in understanding the importance of this obscured phase in galaxy formation .",
    "the _ wise _ all - sky survey operating at mid - infrared wavelengths , has recently led to the identification of a new population of hyperluminous dust - obscured galaxies ( hylirgs ) , whose spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are consistent with a dominant contribution from agn @xcite .",
    "these hylirgs are also postulated to represent the evolutionary link between massive starbursts and luminous quasars .",
    "the _ wise _ samples are complementary to near infrared selected samples as they enable the selection of much more highly obscured agn .",
    "the agn that have so far been identified by _ wise _ are seen to be compton thick @xcite .",
    "broad emission lines originating from gas close to the black - hole are therefore completely concealed and estimating virial black - hole masses is no longer possible .",
    "the wide - field nir ukidss large area survey ( las ) @xcite and vista hemisphere survey ( vhs ; @xcite ) allow us to probe much fainter than was possible using 2mass and enable selection of complementary samples of obscured quasars to the _ wise _ survey . in a survey over @xmath21000 deg@xmath35 of the ukidss and vhs data we were able to identify a population of @xmath34 , @xmath36 quasars ( @xcite - hereafter b12 and b13 respectively ) , demonstrating that contaminant populations can be eliminated without having to rely on radio pre - selection .",
    "our new quasars are among the most bolometrically luminous quasars known ( l@xmath3710@xmath9 erg / s ) but , as a result of their significant dust - extinctions , are often invisible in wide - field optical surveys like sdss .",
    "the sample represents a population of hyperluminous quasars at @xmath34 whose extinction properties are intermediate between uv - selected , essentially unobscured , quasars and the very heavily obscured agn emerging from _",
    "similar obscured luminous quasars showing strong evidence for corresponding to the agn feedback phase , are also now emerging from multi - wavelength degree - scale galaxy surveys such as cosmos @xcite .",
    "indeed the brightest obscured quasar selected from the cosmos survey is the faintest obscured quasar selected in our wide - field ukidss search for similar objects ( b12 ) .",
    "the ability to isolate the luminous agn population with intermediate levels of extinction means that it is now possible to investigate objects with extinctions corresponding to reddenings of @xmath38 .",
    "new insight into the importance of non - spherical geometries ( i.e. ` unified schemes ' ) and evolution , involving specific phases during agn lifetimes , for explaining the distribution of extinction properties can be expected .",
    "our survey also led to the identification of the prototype quasar : ulasj1234 + 0907 , the reddest broad - line quasar currently known . with an eddington ratio of 0.65 ( b12 ) and a neutral hydrogen column - density of 9@xmath39 @xmath26 @xcite , ulasj1234 + 0907 lies in the sparsley - populated high @xmath40 and intermediate gas column regime found from the statistics of hard x - ray sources . among the most luminous quasars known at both x - ray and far - infrared wavelengths , ulasj1234 + 0907 may represent the emerging phase of a supermassive black - hole shortly after a starburst @xcite .",
    "larger surveys for nir - selected , dust - obscured , luminous quasars may unearth more objects like ulasj1234 + 0907 .",
    "the current paper presents a much larger survey for heavily dust - reddened , hyperluminous broad - line quasars at @xmath18 , where the abundance of gas - rich , star - forming galaxies provides a natural explanation for the presence of extended obscuring media in these luminous quasars .",
    "combined with objects presented in b12 and b13 , the new sample allows us to characterise in detail the demographics of the luminous reddened quasar population at @xmath41 , including the direct calculation of the space density over a three - magnitude interval .",
    "we emphasise that the parameter space sampled by our survey is very different from that of x - ray surveys for obscured agn in deep fields covering only a few square degrees . a companion paper ( alaghband - zadeh et al . , in preparation )",
    "investigates the spatially resolved properties of the new reddened quasars from the ifu data presented here .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "first , the observational data , including the photometric selection ( section 2 ) and spectroscopic follow - up ( section 3 ) , is described . the generation of the key physical properties of the quasars , including extinction estimates , luminosities and black - hole masses , is covered in section 4 , prior to consideration of the object properties derived from wise photometric data in section 5 .",
    "the primary scientific result , the calculation of the population space density and luminosity function is presented in section 6 , followed by a summary of the main results in section 7 . throughout the paper we assume a flat @xmath42cdm cosmology with h@xmath43=0.70 , @xmath44 and @xmath45=0.70 .",
    "the vhs magnitudes are on the ab system where the conversions from vega to ab used are : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "all _ wise _ magnitudes and colours are on the vega system .",
    "we make use of new wide - field infrared photometry over @xmath61500 deg@xmath35 from vhs and _ wise _ , in order to identify luminous reddened quasar candidates in the southern hemisphere .",
    "in addition , we also use @xmath23000 deg@xmath35 of imaging data from the ukidss large area survey ( las ) @xcite in the northern hemisphere , to select a sample of the reddest quasars , such as ulasj1234 + 0907 @xcite .",
    "the details of the colour selection has been presented in b13 but we provide a summary here .",
    "candidates must be morphologically classified as point sources in the @xmath49-band ( i.e. with @xmath50 ; @xcite ) and possess extremely red nir colours of @xmath51 .",
    "the morphology cut is necessary to ensure that we isolate a population of quasars at high redshifts corresponding to the peak epoch of black - hole accretion activity , where the host galaxy light in the nir is sub - dominant .",
    "the red colours of these quasars in the nir , can then be attributed to dust - reddening rather than galaxy starlight .",
    "wise _ colour - cut of @xmath52 is then applied to separate quasars from stars .",
    "candidates are required to be detected at a signal - to - noise - ratio ( s / n ) of @xmath25 in both the _ wise _ @xmath53 and @xmath54 bands . as shown in b13 , this selection is extremely effective in isolating rare populations of heavily reddened quasars at high redshifts .",
    "our quasar sample encompasses several different survey regions .",
    "below we describe the candidate selection criteria used in each of these regions as well as ancillary multi - wavelength data that were used to prioritise targets for spectroscopy . after applying the colour and morphology selections in each of our survey areas ,",
    "all candidates were visually inspected in order to remove spurious sources .",
    "the most common such spurious sources are instances of close neighbours in the vhs data with separations of @xmath553arcsec and where the _ wise _ photometry appears to be blended , making the _ wise _ colours unreliable .",
    "the survey regions , selection criteria and number of candidates are summarised in table [ tab : area ] .    * _ the vhs - des stripe82 region _ : this region ( 20h@xmath55ra@xmath550h , @xmath56 ) overlaps the sdss stripe82 multi - epoch survey where the coadded data reaches @xmath572mag fainter than the main sdss survey @xcite .",
    "as discussed in b12 , we used the deep coadd sdss stripe82 photometry to select only the subset of red @xmath58 candidates that are also faint and red at optical wavelengths .",
    "candidates were therefore required to satisfy the additional selection criteria : @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "+ many of our infrared - selected candidates that failed this cut and are blue and bright in the optical , possess sdss or boss spectra .",
    "later , in section [ sec : optical ] , we show the sdss spectra to demonstrate which object populations are eliminated by the optical cuts and to determine what the contaminants may be in regions where we do not yet have optical coverage .",
    "our selection produced 10 candidates down to a flux limit of @xmath61 over 129deg@xmath35 , after visual inspection to remove spurious and blended sources .",
    "two of the 10 , ulasj2150@xmath620055 and ulasj2224@xmath620015 , were observed as part of the sample described in b12 .",
    "one more candidate ( sdssj211805.27 + 010344.7 ) has an optical spectrum from sdss where it is classified as a @xmath63 quasar , although with low confidence .",
    "the optical spectrum does not show any obvious emission lines .",
    "the remaining seven sources were added to our spectroscopic target list . * _ the vhs - des spt region _ : in this region ( 20h@xmath55ra@xmath550h , @xmath64 ) we identify a total of 29 candidates down to a flux limit of @xmath65 over 498deg@xmath35 .",
    "in addition , over the 83deg@xmath35 area of the ` spt deep field ' ( centred at 23h@xmath55ra@xmath5500h and @xmath66 ) , the selection was extended to @xmath67 , giving four additional candidates .",
    "the spt deep field benefits from multi - wavelength coverage from _ spitzer _",
    "@xcite , _ herschel _ and _ xmm - newton _ , which can be used to investigate the multi - wavelength properties of our quasars .",
    "* _ the vhs - atlas sgc region : _ in this region covered by vhs ( 20h@xmath55ra@xmath550h , @xmath68 ) we only selected candidates over the @xmath6488deg@xmath35 area with optical photometry from the sdss .",
    "the vhs - atlas regions have shallower @xmath69-band coverage compared to vhs - des @xcite and the selection of candidates with extremely red @xmath58 colours is prone to contamination from larger numbers of spurious sources .",
    "however , unlike the vhs - des region , vhs - atlas also benefits from @xmath70-band coverage , which we used to impose an additional selection criterion : @xmath71 .",
    "three candidates were selected and verified to be faint and red at optical wavelengths based on the sdss data . * _ the vhs - atlas ngc region : _ this region ( 13h40@xmath55ra@xmath5516h20 and @xmath68 ) encompasses the area used for target selection in our pilot survey ( b13 ) .",
    "nine bright targets with @xmath72 were selected from 421deg@xmath35 .",
    "two of which , vhsj1350 - 0503 and vhsj1409 - 0830 , were observed in b13 .",
    "the remaining seven candidates were added to our spectroscopic target list . * _ the ukidss - las data release 10 @xmath73 sample : _ finally , using the ukidss - las dr10 , covering a total area of 3131deg@xmath35 at dec@xmath5520@xmath74 ( observable from the very large telescope ) , we also constructed a candidate list of the reddest quasars which satisfy the additional colour selection criterion of @xmath73 and have @xmath75 .",
    "these would correspond to the dustiest hyperluminous quasars at these high redshifts with @xmath76 and the objective was to find more quasars like ulasj1234 + 0907 @xcite .",
    "three of these extremely red candidates were visible at the time of observations and were also added to our spectroscopic target list .    our final candidate list comprised a total of 53 spectroscopic targets , excluding candidates already observed by b12 and b13 . as described below , 48 of these targets were successfully observed , with 24 classified as broad - line quasars .",
    "the candidate list includes a complete sample of 41 objects , with @xmath77 , over a region of 1115deg@xmath35 , selected to provide quantitative constraints on the space density of the reddened quasar population .",
