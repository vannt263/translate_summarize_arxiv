    "the idea of quark - lepton compositeness  @xcite goes along with our intention to describe nature in terms of its most fundamental building blocks . as its name suggests , in the models with quark - lepton compositeness , the standard model ( sm ) fermions are not elementary but rather have finer substructures .",
    "similarities between the sm lepton and quark sectors ( like , both come with three flavors and behave similarly under the @xmath5 gauge symmetry with the same weak coupling ) can be explained if they are assumed to be different bound states of some fundamental constituents .",
    "these fundamental constituents , called preons by pati and salam  @xcite , are charged under some new strong force which confines them below a certain scale @xmath2 , known as the compositeness scale .",
    "as we have hadrons in qcd , in this scenario one expects a host of new exited preonic - condensates",
    ". some of these condensates would be quite exotic , as they would carry both @xmath6 color charges and lepton numbers , like the bosonic leptoquarks ( lqs or @xmath7 s ) that transform as triplets under @xmath6  @xcite or the leptogluons ( lgs or @xmath8 s ) that are color - octet fermions @xcite etc .",
    "because of their color charges , if these exotic condensates have tev - range masses , they would be produced copiously at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) making it possible to probe this scenario experimentally",
    ".    the lhc has already put some constraints on the masses of scalar lqs decaying to sm quarks and leptons @xcite . of these , we look at the most recent search by cms , for the first and second generations of scalar lqs in the @xmath9 and the @xmath10 channels with 19.7 fb@xmath11 of integrated luminosity at the 8 tev lhc  @xcite . with pair production ,",
    "the 95% confidence level ( cl ) exclusion limit on the mass of the first ( second ) generation scalar lq now stands at @xmath12 ( 1080 ) gev assuming it always decays to an electron ( a muon ) and a jet . note",
    "that unless specified otherwise , we do not distinguish between any particle and its anti - particle .",
    "hence , an electron here could mean a positron as well .",
    "in the first generation search , mild excesses of events compared to the sm background were observed in both the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 channels for @xmath13 650 gev .",
    "currently , these excesses have attracted considerable attention in the literature .",
    "cms has also performed a dedicated search for the single productions of the first two generations of lqs in the @xmath14 channels  @xcite . however , unlike the mostly qcd mediated pair production , the single productions depend strongly on an unknown coupling @xmath15 , the @xmath7-@xmath16-@xmath17 coupling .",
    "hence , the exclusion limits from this search are @xmath15 dependent .",
    "for the first generation , the exclusion limit goes from 895 gev to 1730 gev when @xmath15 goes from 0.4 to 1.0 and for the second generation the data exclude @xmath18 below 530 gev for @xmath19 .    in this letter",
    ", we recast the cms 8 tev @xmath0  @xcite and @xmath1  @xcite data in terms of the first generation spin-1/2 lg carrying unit electric charge , _",
    "i.e. _ , the color octet partner of the sm electron ( @xmath3 ) to probe the composite quark - lepton scenarios and obtain the most stringent limits available on the @xmath3 .",
    "this is possible because a lg can also decay to a lepton and a jet ( gluon ) just like a lq .",
    "hence , the pair production of @xmath3 s would have @xmath0 final states . or @xmath20 ( @xmath21 , color octet partner of a neutrino ) but not both .",
    "hence , unlike lqs , the qcd mediated pair production of lgs can not have a @xmath22 final state .",
    "however , depending on the underlying model , a charged @xmath23 and a neutral @xmath21 might couple simultaneously with a sm @xmath24 boson allowing a weak interaction mediated process , pp(w_8_8 ) j  _ j  , with the @xmath25 final state . ] earlier , there have been other phenomenological studies on lgs  @xcite and the cms 7 tev @xmath0 data  @xcite were used to infer bounds on @xmath4  @xcite . considering the pair production , ref .",
    "@xcite put the mass exclusion limit at about 1.2 - 1.3 tev .",
    "similarly , an @xmath3 could be produced singly in association with an electron and give rise to an @xmath1 final state .",
    "interestingly , the single productions of lgs open up a way to probe the compositeness scale .",
    "this is because , at the leading order ( lo ) , the @xmath8-@xmath16-@xmath26 interaction comes from an effective operator of dimension five that is suppressed by the compositeness scale @xmath2  @xcite ( see the next section ) .",
    "this is unlike the lq interactions , where the lo terms are of dimension four and hence , apparently insensitive to @xmath2 .    in a recent paper  @xcite , we pointed out that the single productions of lqs can also lead to the @xmath0 final state and similarly , events from the pair productions could also pass the signal selection criteria of the single production search in the @xmath1 channel .",
    "combining these production processes in the signal simulations can provide better limits in the @xmath18-@xmath15 plane from both the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 channels .",
    "the same argument applies for lgs too .",
    "hence , following ref .",
    "@xcite , here we systematically combine both the pair and the single production processes of the @xmath3 while reinterpreting the cms @xmath0 and @xmath1 data and obtain exclusion limits in the @xmath4-@xmath2 plane . this way",
    ", we obtain the mass exclusion limits as well as the limits on the compositeness scale from both the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 data and compare them .",
    "our presentation is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss the details of the signal we consider , in section [ sec : three ] , we present the results of our recast analysis , in section [ sec : futpros ] we investigate the prospect of discovering the color octet electron at the 13 tev lhc and then in section [ sec : last ] we conclude .",
    "if we assume @xmath4 is smaller than @xmath2 and there is no violation of lepton flavor , we can write a generic effective lagrangian for the @xmath3 allowed by the sm gauge symmetry as  @xcite , = |e_8^a i^(_^ac + g_s f^abcg^b _ ) e_8^c - m_e_8|e_8^a e_8^a + _ int,[eq : lag ] with  @xcite , _ int = g^a _ + +  .[eq : intlag ] in the lagrangian , we have displayed only those dimension five terms that are important for our study . or @xmath27 vertices ( may contain form factors ) that would affect the production cross section .",
    "for simplicity , we assume the unknown coefficients associated with these terms are negligible.[fn : footnote1 ] ] here , @xmath28 is the gluon field strength tensor , and @xmath29 are the chirality factors . since , the electron chirality conservation implies @xmath30 , we set @xmath31 and @xmath32 in our analysis without any loss of generality .",
    "this dimension five interaction opens two decay modes for the color octet electron : @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "however , since the three body decay is more suppressed than the two body one , we simply set the total width of the @xmath3 as  @xcite , .",
    "the production processes of the @xmath3 at the lhc ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fyndiags ] for some representative feynman diagrams ) are discussed in much detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . instead",
    ", here we focus on some essential points .",
    "the main contribution to the @xmath3 pair production comes from the purely qcd mediated diagrams ( see _ e.g. _ fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn_pair_1 ] ) . at the lo",
    ", there is an additional @xmath35-channel electron exchange diagram whose amplitude is proportional to @xmath36 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn_pair_e_ex ] ) but , for the ranges of @xmath4 and @xmath2 we consider in this letter , its contribution is small compared to the model independent qcd mediated contribution .",
    "that is why the pair production process is practically insensitive to the compositeness scale . on the other hand ,",
    "all the single production diagrams contain at least one @xmath3-@xmath37-@xmath26 or @xmath3-@xmath37-@xmath26-@xmath26 vertex ( @xmath38 ) coming from the interaction term of eq .",
    "( see _ e.g. _ figs .",
    "[ fig : feyn_sin_2bd ] &  [ fig : feyn_sin_3bd ] ) .",
    "we simulate the pair and the single productions of @xmath3 at the 8 tev lhc to estimate their contributions to the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 channels by modeling eqs .   and in feynrules  @xcite .",
    "we use the cteq6l1 parton distribution functions ( pdfs )  @xcite to generate events with madgraph5 @xcite and then shower them with pythia6 @xcite .",
    "we set the factorization and the renormalization scales , @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 .",
    "we use delphes 3.3.1 @xcite to simulate the cms detector environment and implement the selection cuts . in delphes ,",
    "jets are clustered with fastjet  @xcite using the anti-@xmath42 jet clustering algorithm  @xcite with the clustering parameter , @xmath43 . since",
    ", we generate the pair and the single productions separately , any possible interference between them has been ignored .",
    "however , this is justified as , for the parameters considered , the @xmath3 decay width is much smaller than its mass ( _ i.e. _ , narrow width regime ) .",
    "we generate events for the inclusive single production for certain @xmath44 by combining the following processes , _",
    "= _ o[eq : matching_ee ] where the curved connections indicate a pair of electron and gluon coming from an on - shell @xmath3 .",
    "however , a straightforward computation of cross section for the combined single and pair production processes would lead to some difficulties .",
    "like , the jets that are not coming from a lg could be soft and lead to divergences .",
    "ideally , to handle these divergences , one has to go beyond a tree level computation while combining the different single production processes as in eq .  .",
    "moreover , such combination can lead to double counting of some diagrams while showering .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we avoid these difficulties by employing the matrix element - parton shower matching ( me@xmath45ps ) technique with the shower-@xmath42 scheme  @xcite which effectively provides a consistent interpolation between the hard partons and the pythia parton showers ( ps ) .",
    "it relies on the pythia ps for the soft jets and the parton level matrix elements for the hard jets and thereby , bypasses the double counting and the soft jets problems .",
    "the cross section for any other value of @xmath46 ( say ) is obtained by simply multiplying the cross section for @xmath47 by @xmath48 , since , as explained earlier , the @xmath2 dependence of the inclusive single production cross section ( @xmath49 ) can be written as , _",

    "however , it is normal to expect these corrections to be smaller than the qcd mediated lo pair production . ] beyond this mass range , the limit becomes a function of @xmath2 . as the mass increases , the single productions dominate the combined signals in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 channels giving almost overlapping limits that can also be interpreted as the limits on @xmath2 .",
    "data in both channels indicate that @xmath119 tev for 1.5 tev @xmath120 2 tev . beyond this mass range , where the exclusion limits enter in the region with @xmath121 ,",
    "our effective theory approach becomes unreliable .",
    "we clearly mark this region in all the relevant plots .",
    "this is an inherent limitation present in any effective theory approach .",
    "it might also happen that , in nature , the @xmath3 is actually heavier than the compositeness scale . in that case , all our limits / predictions would not be reliable except in the parameter region dominated by the ( qcd mediated ) pair production .",
    "for example , let us suppose that , in nature , @xmath2 is actually smaller than 1.5 tev , the mass range disfavored by the pair production data . in that case , we will still be able to say that the @xmath3 can not exist below 1.5 tev but we would not be able to conclude anything definitively about @xmath2 from our analysis .",
    "notice that there are other higher dimensional operators ( like @xmath122 or @xmath123 for contact interactions ) that , in principle , could also connect @xmath2 with the @xmath124 data irrespective of the values of @xmath4 .",
    "however , two points go against them  the first , the signal selection criteria are not designed to favor them , and the second , these operators are of dimensions higher than five ( so unless @xmath2 is very small , in which case the whole effective theory approach might break down , these terms are expected to be highly suppressed ) .",
    "hence , despite the inherent limitation , our approach gives the best available limits on @xmath2 and @xmath4 from the cms 8tev @xmath0 and @xmath1 data within the domain of validity of the effective theory ( compare the limit on @xmath4 with the limit quoted in the particle data book  @xcite , @xmath125 86 gev from old tevatron data  @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we note that one can also analyze the second generation @xmath126 data in terms of color octet muon",
    ". however , it will be a very similar exercise and we do not expect that it will provide very different limits on @xmath2 than what we have obtained . in case of the lq , production of the second generation is reduced compared to the first generation because of the relative suppression of the second generation quark pdfs .",
    "however , since the lg productions at the lhc are mainly gluon mediated , they remain roughly the same for any generation ."
