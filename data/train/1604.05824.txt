    "as the dimension of investigated systems increases , it becomes more complicated to demonstrate their quantum effects @xcite .",
    "indeed , a full characterization ( quantum tomography ) becomes practically impossible already for systems of rather small dimensionality @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to explore new avenues to prove the presence of such effects , e.g.  entanglement , for arbitrary dimensions .",
    "high - dimensional entangled states offer a larger code space , attracting interests for quantum key distribution @xcite , teleportation @xcite and security - enhanced quantum cryptography @xcite .    in this context , proving that one has achieved entanglement ( entanglement certification ) and detecting entanglement are different primitives .",
    "indeed , entanglement detection methods @xcite must be as sensitive as possible and must be able to detect the largest possible class of entangled states .",
    "often such methods are inapplicable to large system dimensions or scale poorly with increasing dimension as they entail increasingly complicated measurements and data analysis .",
    "entanglement detection such as witness operators , for instance , typically requires a number of local measurement settings that scales linearly in @xmath0 @xcite . in contrast",
    ", entanglement certification refers to the fact that one has simply to prove that the system is entangled . to do entanglement certification",
    ", one can optimize the method to the specific entangled state that one is producing .",
    "it must fulfill different requirements : it must be as robust and simple as possible . in other words a good method for entanglement detection can also work for entanglement certification , but not vice versa .    here",
    "we present an entanglement certification procedure that is extremely simple to implement ( the measurement of two local observables @xcite suffices ) , is compatible with current state - of - the - art experimental techniques , and can be easily scaled up to arbitrary dimension .",
    "in addition to certifying the production of entangled states , our procedure can also certify the production of maximal entanglement .",
    "to prove its simplicity , we present an experimental test that uses entangled systems with dimension up to @xmath2 , constructed by suitably grouping couples of entangled photon pairs . in the general case ,",
    "for a two - qudit experiment with arbitrary @xmath0 , two measures would still be sufficient to implement our method , but not sufficient for tomography or other entanglement detection methods . to certify the presence of entanglement",
    ", one has only to calculate the ( classical ) correlations among the measurement outcomes of the two observables , for example , through their mutual information .",
    "if such correlations are larger than some threshold , the state is guaranteed to be entangled ( fig .",
    "[ f : fig1 ] ) .",
    "if they attain their maximum value , the state must be maximally entangled .",
    "if @xmath3 and @xmath4 are complementary properties , the knowledge of @xmath3 gives no information on @xmath4 and vice versa .",
    "this happens whenever @xmath5 , for all @xmath6 and @xmath7 eigenstates of the observables @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where @xmath0 is the hilbert space dimension .",
    "this is equivalent to two sets of mutually unbiased bases ( mub s ) .",
    "consider the two - qubit maximally entangled state @xmath8 ; it clearly has maximal correlation among results for the observables with eigenstates @xmath9 : both qubits have the same value .",
    "this state has also maximal correlation among results for a complementary observable with eigenvalues @xmath10 , since it can be written as @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the mutual information between measurement outcomes on the two qubits is one bit per observable , summing to two bits .",
    "if one has only separable states , the sum can not be larger than one : for example , the classically correlated state @xmath12 has one bit of mutual information for the outcomes of the first observable , but zero bits for the outcomes of the second .",
    "starting from the theoretical suggestions of @xcite , we extend the method from the qubit ( @xmath13 ) case to arbitrary high dimensions .",
    "the proposed mechanism to certify entanglement thus uses the following procedure :    1 .   identify two bipartite complementary observables @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 are system 1 observables and @xmath17 are system 2 observables ( fig .  [",
    "f : fig1]a ) .",
    "2 .   measure the statistics of the outcomes of the two observables : local measurements on the two systems suffice . 3 .",
    "these measurements return the joint probabilities @xmath18 of obtaining outcome @xmath19 on system 1 for @xmath3 and @xmath20 on system 2 for @xmath21 , and @xmath22 of obtaining outcome @xmath23 on system 1 and @xmath24 on system 2 .",
    "use them to calculate the mutual information @xmath25 among measurement results for @xmath14 and @xmath26 among results for @xmath15 , with @xmath27 4 .",
    "certification : if @xmath28 , the two systems are entangled ; if @xmath29 , the two systems are maximally entangled .",
    "the proof of these statements , based on maassen and uffink s entropic uncertainty relation @xcite is given in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    in regards to the choosing the observables , for pure states , the obvious choice would be the schmidt bases and their respective fourier bases . whilst for mixed states , one can diagonalise the density matrix , identify the eigenvector with the largest weight and use the schmidt basis ( and its respective fourier bases ) .",
    "alternatively , one can choose the bases that diagonalises the reduced density matrices . while there is no guarantee that these choices will allow one to implement the procedure , they are the ones that may uncover the most correlations .",
    "this method is simple to implement for systems of any dimensionality : it only entails independent measurements of two local observables on the two systems .",
    "moreover , it is robust since , although one can optimize the choice of observables to maximize the sum of mutual information , the systems are guaranteed to be entangled if the above conditions are satisfied for _ any _ couple of complementary observables .",
    "it is interesting to note that , coherently performing sequential complementary measurements on the same system may generate the entanglement itself @xcite .    to date ,",
    "the most prominent way of producing higher dimensional entangled systems is via the orbital angular momentum degree of freedom of a photon @xcite ; schemes to produce three - level entangled states in trapped ions have also been proposed @xcite .",
    "our method , however , works for any d - dimensional system as long as the appropriate measurements can be performed .    based on the theoretical work by collins et al .",
    ", other recent experiments @xcite have studied higher dimensional entangled system via generalised bell s inequalities , where the correlations between the two measurement settings on each are studied . the violation of bell s inequality is usually discussed in terms of quantum non - locality . in this context , the framework of hidden variable theories is in general specified by the 4 measurement settings , each with @xmath0 outcomes , therefore needing @xmath30 joint probabilites @xcite to describe the system globally . in this case , @xcite examine two settings on each system , and how the observables on one system are correlated with the two observables on the second system , requiring a total of @xmath31 joint outcomes . on the other hand ,",
    "our method is based on entropic relations , requiring only two measurement settings , and is completely specified by @xmath32 probabilities . similarly to @xcite , we used ensembles of individual entangled photon pairs to construct a higher dimensional state .",
    "all the subsystems that compose this state do not exist at the same time , but that is irrelevant to our current aims .    to demonstrate the method in practice , we performed an experiment using high - dimensional entangled systems .",
    "we certify the presence of entanglement for various families of states , by measuring pairs of complementary observables .",
    "these families are obtained by appropriately grouping couples of polarisation entangled photonic qubits , mapping qudits onto qubits : @xmath33 where this mapping is obtained by expressing @xmath34 in binary notation and rearranging the qubits in such a way that the ones placed in odd positions in the tensor products on the right hand side are assigned to system 1 while the ones in even positions to system 2 .",
    "for example , a @xmath35 maximally entangled state can be expressed as @xmath36 where qubits labeled @xmath37 and @xmath38 belong to system 1 , while @xmath39 and @xmath40 to system 2 .",
    "it would also be extremely interesting to show that one could coherently manipulate the @xmath41 entangled pairs locally , though that is not necessary to implement our method ( which is also one of the main strength of the method ) .",
    "an analogous mapping applies to the mixed states : @xmath42    regarding the necessary measurements , the observable @xmath14 corresponds to @xmath43 , namely the computational basis @xmath44 for each qubit . as to the observable @xmath15 , we will consider two possibilities : the fourier basis and the @xmath45 basis .",
    "the fourier basis is defined as @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "it can be expressed as tensor products of single - qubit states ( see supplementary material ) .",
    "the fourier basis in arbitrary dimension identifies an observable complementary to the computational basis .",
    "however , in the case considered here , there are complementary bases that are simpler to access experimentally , namely the bases where one measures @xmath45 or @xmath48 on each qubit .",
    "we consider @xmath45 here .",
    "the @xmath45 basis is given by @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) obtained by expressing the binary digits of @xmath51 in the @xmath52 basis , i.e. @xmath53    where @xmath54 are the bits of the number @xmath51 .",
    "the @xmath45 basis is complementary to the computational basis , since @xmath55 for all @xmath56 .",
    "we tested our entanglement certification procedure on several families of states .",
    "these particular states that we consider are arbitrarily chosen for their simplicity .",
    "for the specific examples , the entanglement of the @xmath0-dimensional entangled pair is exactly the same as the one obtained from consecutive entangled two - photon states .",
    "this happens only when @xmath0 is a power of two , though the method works for any @xmath0 .",
    "the first is @xmath57 which mixes the maximally entangled state of equation   with the state in equation with classical correlation only on the computational basis , the above state is always entangled for @xmath58 .    the experimental test of this prediction is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : higher_d ] , red circles ( the markers are the data points and the connecting lines are the expected curves fitted to density matrices from quantum state tomography ) .",
    "the second family of states we consider are the werner states : a mixture of a maximally entangled and a maximally mixed state , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the identity @xmath61 matrix .",
    "these states are entangled for @xmath62 ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "their mutual information is experimentally determined as the green triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig : higher_d ] .",
    "the third family of states is @xmath63 where @xmath64 . the experimental results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : higher_d ] as blue stars ( when the @xmath15 observable is the @xmath45 basis @xmath49 ) and as purple diamonds ( when @xmath15 is the fourier basis @xmath65 ) .",
    "measurements in the fourier basis and in the @xmath45 basis are performed for @xmath66 and 8 only , due to the large number of projections required for higher dimensions where temporal phase instability would significantly affect the measurements .",
    "this state shows the difference between the complementary bases : its form implies that correlations are greater in the @xmath45 than the fourier basis .",
    "the entanglement certification method can be modified by using a different measure of correlations . indeed , instead of the mutual information , one can also measure correlations with the pearson coefficient @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the expectation value of @xmath69 and @xmath70 its variance.it measures the linear correlation between the outcomes of two observables @xmath3 and @xmath21 , and takes values @xmath71 .",
    "it is conjectured @xcite that if @xmath72 , then the state is entangled .",
    "moreover , it is known that if @xmath73 , the state is maximally entangled .",
    "this may be helpful in high - noise scenarios , since it allows for the certification of a larger class of entangled states .",
    "the pearson correlation coefficient seems to be more robust against imbalanced probabilities or decoherence in the experiment ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pearson ] ) , and numerical simulations suggest that it is more effective in detecting entanglement @xcite .",
    "so , in addition to the sum of mutual information @xmath74 , we can use @xmath75 as an alternative way of certifying entanglement ( modulo a conjecture ) .",
    "we consider the two - qubit states @xmath76 and the werner state @xmath77 of eq . with @xmath13 . in , @xmath78 .",
    "the state @xmath79 is entangled for @xmath80 , whereas @xmath81 is always separable and has zero discord only for @xmath82 . for two - qubit states ,",
    "the @xmath45 basis @xmath49 coincides with the fourier basis @xmath65 , so the two possible observables @xmath15 we used above coincide here .",
    "however , we preferred working with mutual information since the fact that the pearson coefficient can be used to certify entanglement is still a conjecture , whereas it has been rigorously proved for the sum of mutual information .    whilst it is true that the standard entanglement witness @xmath83 out - performs our method for entanglement dection for the ( @xmath84 case ) werner state ( detects entanglement at @xmath85 ) , this is not true for arbitrary dimensions in general .    finally , also comparing this agains bell s inequalities using the werner state , our method using mutual information with two complementary observables ( computational and @xmath45 basis ) , for d = 2 , the threshold of log@xmath86 is surpassed at p@xmath87 0.78 .",
    "however , if we increase this to three observables ( indeed one can , and in this case we consider the @xmath48 basis ) , the entanglement is detected at p@xmath87 0.65 ( see supplementary material of @xcite ) , which outperforms bell s inequalities at @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "also , in the limit of large @xmath0 , our method ( see eq ( s7 ) in the supplementary material ) also out - performs the threshold in bell s inequality violation , given in @xcite .    in summary",
    ", we have presented an entanglement certification method that is suitable for large dimensional systems . to our knowledge , there are no such methods that are as efficient to implement on a 32-dimensional system such as the one we experimentally study here .",
    "we have shown that entangled states are more correlated on the outcomes of complementary observables .",
    "one may think that this property is shared by other types of quantum correlations such as quantum discord @xcite but , surprisingly , this is not the case , at least when the correlations are gauged through mutual information .",
    "indeed , the separable state @xmath81 has highest @xmath74 for @xmath89 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pearson ] ) , the values for which its discord is null .",
    "in contrast , @xmath74 is lowest for @xmath90 which is where such state has highest discord .",
    "this unexpected property is lost when the correlation is gauged with the pearson coefficient , as @xmath91 for all values of @xmath92 .",

    "the photons are then collected into polarisation maintaining fibres ( pmf ) , where the pbs transmits h and reflects v ; in combination with post - selection , the measured state is @xmath98 after renormalisation .",

    "the set up is shown in fig.[fig : scheme ] .",
    "a type - i nonlinear crystal ( bibo ) is pumped with a vertically polarised cw laser ( 404 nm ) at 80 mw , generating pairs of h polarised single photons ( 808 nm ) .",
    "the photons are spectrally filtered using 3 nm top - hat filteres centred on 808 nm . the first half way plate hwp@xmath93 ( optics axis set to @xmath101 radians ) rotates the output photon pair from @xmath102 to @xmath103 , where @xmath104 .",

    "the polarisation maintaining fibres has a beat length ( h and v delayed with respect to each other by @xmath119 ) of 24 mm ; the coherence length of the photon pairs is 250 @xmath120 m ( extracted from a hong - ou - mandel dip of 99@xmath121 visibility ) , which means that if uncompensated , 1.0 m of fibre will spatially separate the h and v components of a photon out of coherence , turning a bell state @xmath122 into the classically correlated mixture @xmath123 .",
    "when producing a bell state , this spatial decoherence was compensated by crossing the slow axis of the pmf and tuning the stage position of the fibre ( and vice versa when the mixed state is required ) .",
