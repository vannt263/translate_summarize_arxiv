    "experimental investigations of transport phenomena in ultra - cold atoms confined in engineered optical potentials offer a test bed for transport theories at the nanoscale .",
    "several phenomena , such as the sloshing motion of an atomic cloud in optical lattices @xcite , directed transport using a quantum ratchet @xcite , relaxation of noninteracting and interacting fermions in optical lattices @xcite , and others have been demonstrated .",
    "their applications in atomtronics @xcite , which aims at simulating electronics by using controllable atomic systems , are promising @xcite .",
    "it is thus important to develop proper theoretical and computational methods to direct future progress in this field .    due to the quantum nature of atoms , finite particle numbers , and small sizes of these systems ,",
    "the applicability of semi - classical approaches , such as the boltzmann equation , become questionable .",
    "the landauer formalism @xcite , which has been widely implemented in mesoscopic physics , is naturally appealing for studying transport phenomena in ultra - cold atoms .",
    "those approaches and their generalizations have been applied to study various problems in cold atoms @xcite .",
    "in addition to steady - state properties , one may want to study fluctuation effects and correlations using full - counting statistics ( fcs ) @xcite .",
    "an examination of the underlying assumptions of those well - known formalisms , however , raise questions on their applicability to ultra - cold atoms .",
    "the landauer formalism , which is designed for open systems , assumes the existence of two reservoirs that supply particles to be transmitted through a junction region . since the particle number and energy ( when no external time - dependent fields are present ) in ultra - cold atomic experiments are ( to a very good approximation ) conserved , the concept of a reservoir does not necessarily hold .",
    "fcs generally assumes the transmitted particles behave like billiards with a well - defined tunneling probability distribution .",
    "whether such an assumption holds true in finite , closed systems will determine whether the formalism can be applied to cold atom experiments as well .",
    "an alternative approach for studying transport in quantum systems is within the _ microcanonical formalism _ ( mcf ) @xcite .",
    "this formalism is based on using closed quantum systems driven out of equilibrium by a change of parameters ( e.g. , an external bias or a density imbalance ) to calculate transport properties .",
    "the conservation of particle number and energy are naturally built into this formalism , and there is no need to introduce reservoirs and one can fully preserve the wave nature of the particles .",
    "this formalism has also been integrated with density - functional theory for investigating quantum transport through atomic or molecular junctions @xcite .",
    "the microcanonical formalism is particularly suitable for ultra - cold atoms , which are accurately modeled as isolated quantum systems . in this respect",
    ", the formalism has already been developed to study transport phenomena in these systems @xcite .    , where a step - function bias is applied to the system and",
    "a current flows through the middle link or ( b ) connecting a link between the two initially disconnected parts at @xmath0 .",
    "[ fig : schematic],width=220 ]    the goal of this paper is to compare the microcanonical approach to the landauer formalism and determine which assumptions lead to the same observables , such as the average current and fcs .",
    "the mcf is generically applicable to closed quantum systems , and here we use transport of ultra - cold non - interacting fermions in one - dimensional ( 1d ) optical lattices as a particular example .",
    "a possible setup is shown in figure [ fig : schematic ] .",
    "unlike electronic systems where the coulomb interactions can not be really switched off , and therefore for which this comparison would be more academic , cold atoms experiments allow for a relatively easy tuning of interactions among particles down to the non - interacting limit .",
    "the microcanonical formalism can , of course , be applied to systems with coulomb interactions . however , here we focus only on its applications to noninteracting cold - atom systems . while electrons are naturally confined in solid - state systems , a background harmonic trapping potential",
    "is often implemented in addition to the optical lattice for confining atoms .",
    "however , recent advance in trapping atoms in ring - shape geometries @xcite or a uniform potential @xcite makes it possible to consider homogeneous cold - atom systems . moreover ,",
    "a weak background harmonic potential does not change the qualitative conclusions from the mcf , as illustrated in ref .",
    "therefore we focus here on the dynamics of cold atoms in optical lattices without a background harmonic trapping potential .",
    "we find that the steady - state current and particle number fluctuations from the microcanonical formalism approach the values of the average current and fcs predicted from the landauer formalism already at moderate system sizes .",
    "however , we also find  for finite times  that one of the assumptions of the landauer formalism is unnecessary : the particle distributions in the two lattices supplying / absorbing particles do not need to be populated according to fermi - dirac distributions .",
    "in fact , their occupation deviates from the equilibrium distribution during the whole duration of a quasi - steady state .",
    "furthermore , the results from the microcanonical formalism agree with the predictions from the fcs semi - classical formula by assuming a binomial distribution of the transmitted particles , ruling out alternative semi - classical descriptions . to connect the different approaches , we also develop a kubo formalism based on the microcanonical picture of transport , which we use to calculate explicit expressions for transport in closed systems .",
    "this gives us an analytical method to investigate dynamical transport phenomena in nanoscale and ultracold atomic systems .",
    "in addition to the average current and fcs , we also investigate the dynamical evolution of the entanglement entropy , which quantifies the correlations between two connected systems .",
    "the entanglement entropy is of broad interest in many fields , ranging from black hole physics @xcite to quantum information science @xcite .",
    "this quantity can be easily evaluated using the microcanonical formalism .",
    "a semi - classical formula based on fcs of two noninteracting fermionic systems connected by a junction has been derived in ref .",
    "@xcite and generalized to many - body systems @xcite .",
    "@xcite predicts a linear growth of the entanglement entropy as time increases .",
    "again , we find that the results from the microcanonical formalism match the prediction from the semi - classical formula by assuming a binomial distribution of the transmitted particles . assuming an alternative distribution results in predictions that are readily distinguishable .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : landauer ] reviews the landauer formalism and its assumptions .",
    "section  [ sec : mcf ] introduces the microcanonical formalism and its applications .",
    "the spatially resolved current from the mcf is discussed in section  [ sec : mcfspatial ] .",

    "section  [ sec : kubo ] reviews the kubo formalism and how it helps connect the two approaches .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusion ] concludes our study with suggestions of future work .",
    "by assuming the existence of a steady - state current between two reservoirs bridged by a central link , the current can be estimated from the landauer formula with the help of , e.g. , green s functions @xcite . for a detailed description of the physical assumptions behind this formalism we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we mention only the assumptions that will be relevant for our comparison with the microcanonical formalism : ( 1 ) a steady - state current is _ assumed _ to exist .",
    "whether a steady - state current always emerges from a given nonequilibrium condition is not at all obvious @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) two macroscopic reservoirs  holding noninteracting fermions populated according to fermi - dirac distributions  are also assumed .",
    "the separation of the system into reservoirs and a region of interest is not always easy to determine for an actual physical structure .",
    "( 3 ) the transport at the junction does not provide any feedback to the reservoirs .    while one can construct configurations where a steady - state current does not exist @xcite , in the case where two 1-d chains are connected by a central junction ( as considered in this paper ) , there is always a steady - state current , as will be verified in the microcanonical formalism ( see section  [ sec : mcfspatial ] ) .",
    "therefore , we do not focus here on assumption ( 1 ) , but rather on ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . as will be shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : comparison ] , the distributions on both sides deviates from the fermi - dirac distribution when the system maintains a steady state so assumption ( 2 ) is not necessary for observing a steady - state current .",
    "moreover , section  [ sec : lightcone ] will show that density changes can propagate into regimes away from the junction so there can be feedback and assumption ( 3 ) is also not necessary .",
    "at @xmath1 for ( a ) the weak - link case ( @xmath2 from top to bottom ) and ( b ) the central - site case ( @xmath3 from top to bottom).,width=326 ]    on the other hand , in this section we calculate the current using the landauer formalism for two configurations of a junction between two 1d lattices .",
    "one can insert a link with a tunable hopping coefficient @xmath4 in the middle of a chain , which we call the _ weak - link case _ , or insert a central site with tunable on - site energy @xmath5 , which we call the _ central - site case_. in cold - atom experiments",
    "it has been shown that one can suppress the transmission of atoms by introducing an optical barrier @xcite or by introducing a constriction in the trapping potential @xcite .",
    "therefore the tunneling coefficient and onsite energy may be tuned simultaneously . here",
    "we separate the effects of tuning the two parameters and one will see that there is no observable difference if the transmission coefficient @xmath6 can be found and physical quantities are compared at the same @xmath6 .",
    "we consider a uniform bias @xmath7 on the left half and , similarly , @xmath8 on the right half . by making the two lattices on both sides semi - infinite ,",

    "the current is @xmath40 figure  [ fig : te_2cases ] shows @xmath41 , which is symmetric about @xmath42 , for both cases with selected parameters .",
    "in the micro - canonical approach to quantum transport  @xcite , one considers a finite system ( say two electrodes and a junction ) and a finite number of particles with hamiltonian @xmath43 .",
    "the system is prepared in an initial state @xmath44 which is an eigenstate of some hamiltonian @xmath45 . from a physical point of view",
    "this initial state may represent , e.g. , a charge , particle , or energy imbalance between the two finite electrodes that sandwich the junction . the system is then left to evolve from this initial condition under the dynamics of @xmath43 , and the average current across some surface or any other observable is monitored in time .",
    "the dynamics considered here may be considered as quantum quenches @xcite .",
    "note that , even if we assume the two electrodes biased as in the landauer formalism , in this closed - system approach it is not at all obvious that the average current establishes any ( quasi-)steady state in the course of time  @xcite .",

    "@xcite , which is an extension of the scheme proposed in ref .  @xcite .",

    "we stress an important feature of the mcf formalism .",
    "one can see from eq .   and its context that mcf monitors the dynamics in both energy basis and real space .",
    "in contrast , the landauer formalism as shown in eq .   only reveals information in the energy basis .",
    "the ability of the mcf to trace the dynamics in real space allows us to address a crucial question : how do particles from different sites contribute to the current ?    to clearly demonstrate the importance of the information from the dynamics in real space , we consider a simplified initial condition where @xmath113 lattice sites are divided into the left @xmath48 sites and the right @xmath48 sites with each left site occupied by one fermion and each right site empty .",
    "we consider a uniform lattice here with a tunneling coefficient @xmath9 .",
    "the corresponding correlation matrix is @xmath114 if @xmath115 and zero otherwise .",

    "therefore in the current @xmath118 it is meaningful to discuss where does the current come from as time evolves .    this simplified case , despite its compactness and clarity , is relevant to several situations realizable in experiments .",
    "two potential examples are : ( 1 ) initially a large step - function bias is applied to a nanowire with a small energy bandwidth so that all mobile particles are driven to the left half and then the bias is removed to allow a current to flow , and ( 2 ) ultra - cold atoms are loaded in an optical lattice so that there is one atom per lattice site",
    ". then a focus laser beam excites the atoms on the right half lattice so that they leave the lattice and create a vacuum region .",
    "the atoms on the filled left part will then flow to the right and build a current .",

    "shows the current from an @xmath91 lattice with the left half initially filled with one fermion per site .",
    "we plot the contributions from sections of @xmath119 sites each to the left of the middle of the whole lattice and the corresponding currents show up in bursts .",
    "the bursts , from left to right on the plot , correspond to the current from the first , second , ... , sixth sections of @xmath119 sites to the left away from the middle ( the @xmath120-th site ) .",
    "[ fig : i_decomp],width=326 ]    figure  [ fig : i_decomp ] shows the total current of this case with @xmath91 and clearly there is a quasi steady - state current .",
    "when we determine the contributions from each section of @xmath119 lattices sites to the left of the middle ( @xmath120-th site ) , each contribution comes in a burst following the previous burst from the section to its right .",
    "thus the burst from the section of the @xmath121-th site to the @xmath120-th site crosses the middle first , followed by the burst from the section of the @xmath122-th site to the @xmath123-th sites , and so on , with each burst having a decaying tail .",
    "this succession of bursts gives a physical justification of the reason the semi - classical distribution assumed in fcs is binomial , and why other distributions can be excluded ( see below ) .",
    "each burst peak plus all the tails from previous bursts add up to maintain the observed quasi steady - state current .",
    "the mcf formalism thus provides more insights into how a quasi steady - state current forms and this is certainly beyond the scope of the landauer s formalism .",
    "since some spin chain problems can be mapped to fermions in 1d , our study is relevant to the dynamics of magnetization in these cases as well @xcite .",
    "for two 1d non - interacting fermionic systems connected by a central barrier , it has been proposed @xcite that an expression for the entanglement entropy can be derived from fcs assuming a binomial distribution of the transmitted particle number . in linear response , it has the form @xmath124.\\label{eq : klich_s}\\ ] ] here , @xmath6 is the transmission coefficient at the fermi energy .",
    "the second moment of transmitted particle numbers , @xmath125 , is important because it may be inferred from shot - noise measurements .",

    "@xcite gives the prediction for @xmath126 : @xmath128 we will briefly review the derivations for these expressions .    in a semi - classical description ,",
    "the second moment of transmitted particle numbers , @xmath125 , is equivalent to the number fluctuations of the left half of the system if the number of particles are conserved .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "let us assume that at time @xmath61 there are @xmath129 particles on the left . at time @xmath130 , if there are @xmath131 particles passing through the barrier , the total number of particles on the left becomes @xmath132 .",

    "we will compare this with the prediction of @xmath125 from the semi - classical formula eq .",

    "before presenting a comparison of the mcf results with those of the landauer formalism , we first investigate how sensitive the mcf results are to the time - dependence of the switch - on of the bias .",
    "this is important because in the landauer formalism a steady state is assumed from the outset , while in the mcf a quasi - steady state develops in time and therefore its magnitude can be dependent on initial conditions and transient behavior of the bias .",

    "<S> therefore , the microcanonical formalism which is designed for closed , finite - size quantum systems seems more suitable for studying particle dynamics in ultra - cold atoms . </S>",
    "<S> our results highlight both the connection and differences with more traditional approaches to calculating transport properties in condensed matter systems , and will help guide the way to their simulations in cold - atom systems .    # 1#1    # 1|#1    # 1#1|    # 1#2|#1#2|    # 1#2#1|#2    # 1#2    # 1#2    # 1#2 </S>"
