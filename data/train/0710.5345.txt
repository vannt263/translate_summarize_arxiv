    "the functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 are exact , that is , they are not obtained by expansions in terms of derivatives about some point .",

    "figure 1 shows a comparison of the distances for these three data sets relative to the standard lambda cold dark matter ( lcdm ) model with @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "a comparison of each data set with the standard lcdm model indicates that both the sn and rg data sets provide reliable cosmology probes , while the sz cluster method perhaps need some refinement ; the reduced chi - square for the sn and rg is about one , as expected from the quoted measurement errors , whereas that for the sz clusters is greater than two , suggesting that the quoted errors substantially underestimate the true uncertainties of these distance measurements .",
    "however , to illustrate how our method can be applied to coordinate distances obtained using different methods , we consider the analysis of the full sample of 260 sources as well as the analysis of the sample of 222 sn and rg .",
    "the distances @xmath12 to each source are used to obtain the distance @xmath9 to any redshift within the redshift range of the sample , and first and second derivatives of the distance with respect to redshift , @xmath10 and @xmath11 and their uncertainties using the method of daly & djorgovski ( 2003 , 2004 ) .    in previous work ,",
    "we have used @xmath26 and @xmath27 to obtain @xmath28 and @xmath0 .",
    "we then compared our empirically determined functions @xmath29 and @xmath0 with predictions in different models .",

( 1 ) .",
    "this derivation does not assume that @xmath41 , is constant , and allows for variable @xmath42 .",
    "the function @xmath43 describes the redshift evolution of the energy density of the dark energy ; in a quintessence model with constant equation of state @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and for a cosmological constant @xmath46 .",
    "the data were analyzed using a sliding window fit , described in section 2.2.1 , and using fits in independent redshift bins , described in section 2.2.2 .",
    "fits are done using the window @xmath47 throughout for the sn data , @xmath48 for the rg data , when considered individually , and @xmath47 for the joint samples using the method described by daly & djorgovski ( 2003 , 2004 ) .",
    "the width of the fitting window is driven by the need to obtain useful confidence intervals for the fits by including a sufficient number of data points . as the size of the available data sets increases in the future ,",
    "this width could be correspondingly narrowed . in decreasing the window function width from 0.6 to 0.5 and 0.4",
    ", the trends and overall results remain the same , the uncertainties increase ( because there are fewer data points in the window ) , and the trends become more noisy ( due to sparser sampling ) . in addition , to test whether the window function has an effect on the trends extracted from the data we created a mock data set with the same number and redshift distribution of points as in each data set and the same fractional error per point , but with @xmath12 values obtained from a standard lcdm cosmology with @xmath49 and @xmath25 and ran it through the programs to extract @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . as expected , the uncertainties increase as the window width decreases due to the smaller number of data points in the window . for a window widths of 0.3 and 0.4 in redshift , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath0 match the input cosmology to very high precision . for widths of 0.5 and 0.6 , there is a very slight offset of @xmath11 and @xmath0 from the input cosmology that sets in above redshifts of about one , at a level that is very small compared with the uncertainties .",
    "thus , the values of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath0 , and quantities obtained by combining these quantities , provide reliable determinations to redshifts well above one .",

    "space curvature , parameterized by @xmath1 , has only a modest effect on @xmath0 , as illustrated in figure [ kqofz192 ] .",
    "positive space curvature , with negative @xmath1 flattens the @xmath0 curve and pushes the redshift at which the universe transitions from an accelerating state to a decelerating state to higher redshift .",
    "this follows since @xmath26 is known to be positive in our universe since the universe is expanding .",
    "similarly , negative space curvature moves the redshift at which @xmath123 to lower redshift causing the universe the transition from an accelerating to a decelerating state at lower redshift . for @xmath67 , the redshift at which the universe transitions from acceleration to deceleration for the davis et al .",
    "( 2007 ) sample is @xmath124 . for negative space curvature with @xmath125 this transition redshift",
    "is shifted to about 0.6 , and for positive space curvature with @xmath126 it shifts to about 0.8 .",
    "space curvature also affects the shape of @xmath5 as illustrated in figure [ keofz192 ] .",
    "positive values of @xmath1 cause @xmath127 to increase more steeply with redshift than negative values of @xmath1 , which tend to flatten out the @xmath127 curve .    thus , the effect of space curvature on @xmath127 and @xmath0 is small relative to the overall uncertainties of their measurements , within a plausible range of the curvature parameter @xmath1 .",
    "we also consider the full sample of 260 sources including the 38 sz clusters of bonamente et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the 192 supernovae of davis et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and the 30 radio galaxies of daly et al .",
    "these results are shown in figure [ yetal260 ] ; a window function of width 0.6 was used to analyze the data .",
    "this analysis illustrates how this method can be applied to diverse data sets .",
    "however , while the sz cluster distances currently provide a useful tool for measurements of the far - field hubble parameter , it is probably premature to use them as standard rulers to probe the global geometry and kinematics of the universe at this time .    gamma - ray bursts as standard candles have been analyzed in detail by schaefer ( 2007 ) , who gives other pertinent references .",
    "the values of @xmath13 listed by schaefer ( 2007 ) can be used to determine the dimensionless coordinate distance to each source if the value of @xmath18 relevant for the sample is known , as described in section 2.1 , and a value of @xmath128 was used ( schaefer , private communication ) .",
    "the dimensionless coordinate distances were analyzed to determine the functions @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 using a window function of width 2.0 in redshift . a first look at results for the gamma - ray bursts are shown in fig .",
    "[ grb ] , which suggest that these are a potentially promising tool to study cosmology at very large distances , and are broadly consistent with predictions in the canonical lcdm model , but the quality and the sparsity of the data are still not sufficient for the model - independent analysis as shown above for the sn+rg sample .",
    "the work presented here improves and extends our previous results .",
    "first , expanded and improved data sets are considered : three supernova samples and one radio galaxy sample .",
    "the radio galaxy data set has 11 new sources , increasing its size to 30 sources , and the supernovae data sets have increased substantially in size and quality . in addition , sz cluster distances and gamma - ray burst distances are considered .",
    "the dimensionless coordinate distances ( obtained directly from the data ) , and first and second derivatives of the distance are obtained as functions of redshift using a sliding window fit .",
    "the good agreement obtained using supernovae and radio galaxies , two completely independent methods , with sources that cover similar redshift ranges , suggests that neither method is strongly affected by systematic effects , and that each method provides a reliable cosmological tool .",
    "the first and second derivatives of the distance are combined to obtain the acceleration parameter @xmath0 , allowing for non - zero space curvature .",
    "it is shown that the zero redshift value of @xmath0 , @xmath129 , is independent of space curvature , and can be obtained from the first and second derivatives of the coordinate distance .",
    "thus , @xmath8 , which indicates whether the universe is accelerating at the current epoch , can be obtained directly from the supernova and radio galaxy data ; our determinations of @xmath0 only relies upon the validity of the robertson - walker line element , and is independent of a theory of gravity , and the contents of the universe .",
    "each of the supernova samples , analyzed using a sliding window fit , indicate that the universe is accelerating today independent of space curvature , independent of whether general relativity is the correct theory of gravity , and of the contents of the universe .",
    "the effect of non - zero space curvature on @xmath0 is to shift the redshift at which the universe transitions from acceleration to deceleration , moving this to lower redshift for negative space curvature and to higher redshift for positive space .",
    "the zero redshift values of @xmath64 obtained using a sliding window fit . for the davis et al .",
    "( 2007 ) supernova sample is @xmath65 and that obtained for the radio galaxy sample of daly et al .",
    "( 2007 ) is @xmath130 indicating that the universe is accelerating at the current epoch .",
    "the data were also binned so that only certain subsets of the data were used to solve for @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath5 , and @xmath0 .",
    "the results for @xmath26 and @xmath5 indicate that the standard lcdm model provides a good description of the data .",
    "the results for @xmath27 and @xmath0 are consistent with the standard lcdm model , but do not independently confirm the model or the acceleration of the universe .",
    "in addition to the evaluation of the standard cosmological parameters , in an even more direct approach , we compared @xmath26 and @xmath27 obtained from the fits to the data to model predictions .",
    "comparisons of @xmath26 and @xmath27 with predictions based on general relativity indicate that general relativity provides an accurate description of the data on look - back time scales of about ten billion years , thus providing a very large scale test of general relativity .",
    "another new approach is that the data were analyzed using both a sliding window fit and fits in independent redshift bins .",
    "the fits in statistically independent redshift bins are broadly consistent with the sliding window fits , but are generally noisier ( as expected ) .",
    "we also explored the effects of non - zero space curvature on determinations of @xmath127 and @xmath0 .",
    "it is shown that the zero redshift value of @xmath64 , obtained by applying equation ( 4 ) to @xmath26 and @xmath27 , is independent of space curvature .",
    "this means that our method can be used to determine @xmath8 , and thus the degree to which the universe is accelerating at the current epoch , with only one assumption , that the robertson - walker line element is valid .",
    "in addition , it is found that the effect of space curvature on the shape of @xmath127 and @xmath0 is small , relative to the uncertainties arising from the measurement errors .    after determining the expansion and acceleration rates of the universe as functions of redshift independent of a theory of gravity , we solve for the pressure , energy density , equation of state , and potential and kinetic energy of the dark energy as functions of redshift assuming that general relativity is the correct theory of gravity . we also define a new function",
    ", the dark energy indicator @xmath98 , which provides a measure of deviations of the equation of state of the dark energy @xmath2 from @xmath3 , and provides a new and independent measure of @xmath4 if @xmath86 .",
    "the results obtained using a sliding window fit indicate that a cosmological constant in a spatially flat universe provides a good description of each of these quantities over the redshift range from zero to one .",
    "the zero redshift values of these quantities obtained with the davis et al .",
    "( 2007 ) supernovae sample are @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath111 . in the standard lambda - cold dark matter model , @xmath136 , obtained using the first and second derivatives of the coordinate distance , provides an independent measure of @xmath85 .",
    "in addition , in this model , @xmath86 , so @xmath98 provides a measure of @xmath4 , and the value obtained here using the first and second derivatives of the coordinate distance , is @xmath112 .",
    "overall , the shapes of the pressure , energy density , equation of state , and other parameters as functions are redshift are consistent with those predicted in a standard lcdm model .",
    "there is a tantalizing hint that there may be divations from the standard model at high redshift ; more observations at high redshift will be needed to investigate this further .",
    "the results obtained using fits in independent redshift bins are consistent with the standard lcdm model , but do not independently confirm the model .",

    "<S> we extend and apply a model - independent analysis method developed earlier by daly & djorgovski to new samples of supernova standard candles , radio galaxy and cluster standard rulers , and use it to constrain physical properties of the dark energy as functions of redshift . </S>",
    "<S> similar results are obtained for the radio galaxy and supernova data sets , which rely upon completely independent methods , suggesting that systematic errors are relatively small for both types of distances ; distances to sz clusters show a scatter which can not be explained by the quoted measurement errors . </S>",
    "<S> the first and second derivatives of the distance are compared directly with predictions in a standard model based on general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> the good agreement indicates that general relativity provides an accurate description of the data on look - back time scales of about ten billion years . </S>",
    "<S> the first and second derivatives are combined to obtain the acceleration parameter @xmath0 , assuming only the validity of the robertson - walker metric , independent of a theory of gravity and of the physical nature of the dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> the data are analyzed using a sliding window fit and using fits in independent redshift bins . </S>",
    "<S> the acceleration of the universe at the current epoch is indicated by the sliding window fit analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of non - zero space curvature on @xmath0 is explored ; for a plausible range of values of @xmath1 the effect is small and causes a to shift to the redshift at which the universe transitions from deceleration to acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> we solve for the pressure , energy density , equation of state , and potential and kinetic energy of the dark energy as functions of redshift assuming that general relativity is the correct theory of gravity . </S>",
    "<S> results obtained using a sliding window fit indicate that a cosmological constant in a spatially flat universe provides a good description of each of these quantities over the redshift range from zero to about one . </S>",
    "<S> we define a new function , the dark energy indicator , in terms of the first and second derivatives of the coordinate distance and show how this can be used to measure deviations of @xmath2 from @xmath3 and to obtain a new and independent measure of @xmath4 . </S>"
