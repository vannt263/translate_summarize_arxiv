    "d - branes are localized probes of the spacetime geometry @xcite .",
    "when a d - brane probe is in the presence of other d - branes there are massive open strings stretching between the probe and the other branes .",
    "when these massive open strings are integrated out one obtains an effective action for the massless fields representing the motion of the probe .",
    "this can be interpreted as the action of a d - brane moving on a nontrivial supergravity background . in many cases",
    "one can find the exact supergravity backgrounds in this fashion @xcite .",
    "most of the backgrounds analyzed previously correspond to bps supergravity solutions .",
    "the calculation in @xcite of d - brane probes moving in a nonsingular extremal black hole background shows agreement for the one loop term but the status of the two loop term is not clear .",
    "we will first consider the field theory problem , including the problem of decoupling the brane theory from the whole string theory .",
    "we discuss some general properties of the effective action for these gauge theories derived by using power counting arguments .",
    "we also do a one loop calculation in this gauge theory .    then we consider the effective action of a probe d - brane moving close to a black d - p - brane . we discuss some cases where we can take the same limit as we took in the gauge theory case .",
    "we find a limit where the black hole is well defined and we can apply supergravity .",
    "we mention that this predicts certain results for the gauge theory .",
    "we discuss the relation of these results with matrix theory , in particular , the relationship of black holes and matrix theory .",
    "we discuss the case of the d - twobrane in some detail , including the appearance of a nontrivial strong coupling ir fixed point and its black hole interpretation .",
    "we finally consider near extremal black holes and we compare the one loop result obtained in both ways . since the background is no longer bps and supersymmetry is broken there is no reason for the forces to cancel .",
    "indeed there is a net force on a static probe .",
    "we also calculate the @xmath3 force and we find agreement with supergravity in _ all _ cases .",
    "we compute the static force for a d - brane configuration with @xmath4 d - fivebranes carrying also @xmath5 d - onebrane charge and some extra energy .",
    "we find precise agreement .",
    "the static force agrees qualitatively in all the other cases .",
    "all one loop calculations of this type reduce to evaluating @xmath6 terms in the gauge theory .",
    "in this section we will consider a d - brane probe in the presence of some other d - branes . by integrating out the stretched open strings we obtain an effective action for the probe . more concretely",
    ", we consider @xmath7 d - branes , @xmath0 of which sit at the origin ( @xmath8 ) and the last is the probe which sits at a distance @xmath9 . at low energies and for small separations",
    "the system is described by a @xmath10 dimensional @xmath11 yang - mills theory with 16 supersymmetries broken down to @xmath12 by the expectation value of an adjoint scalar which measures the distance from the probe to the rest of the branes .",
    "the fields with one index in @xmath13 and the other on @xmath14 are massive , with a mass @xmath15 . if we integrate them out we get an effective action for the light degrees of freedom .",
    "all d - branes have @xmath10 worldvolume dimensions , with @xmath16 .",
    ".5 cm    the action of the yang mills theory is [ action ] s_0 = & - 1 g ( 2)^p ^p-32 d^1+px   14 tr [ f _ f^ ] + & + fermions  , where @xmath17 are ten dimensional indices @xcite .",
    "let us first discuss more precisely the sense in which ( [ action ] ) describes the dynamics of nearby branes more precisely .",
    "we can take the low energy limit of the string theory by taking the energies to be fixed and letting @xmath18 . in order for the energies of the stretched strings to remain finite",
    "we should let the separation of the branes @xmath19 in such a way that @xmath20 is fixed .",
    "the field @xmath21 is the field describing transverse displacements of the branes and has dimensions of energy . in this way",
    "the integrand in ( [ action ] ) has no explicit factors of @xmath22 .",
    "we should also , at the same time , make sure that the gauge theory coupling constant remains finite .",
    "this implies that @xmath23 is fixed . for @xmath24",
    "this implies that @xmath25 , for @xmath26 it does not impose any condition on @xmath27 and for @xmath28 it implies that @xmath29 .",
    "so for @xmath28 we should analyze the problem in a dual theory .",
    "for @xmath30 we have in this limit the ( 0,2 ) theory of coincident 5-branes @xcite in m - theory compactified on a circle of radius @xmath31 .",
    "for @xmath32 we have to do a iib s - duality transformation and we end up with ns fivebranes in the limit that @xmath33 and the coupling constant is @xmath34 . in this limit",
    "we obtain theories decoupled from the bulk @xcite . for @xmath35",
    "it is not clear whether the theory really decouples from the bulk .",
    "notice that , in this limit , the probe brane is getting very close to the other branes , at a distance much smaller than the string length . in summary , the limit which produces a decoupled brane theory is [ decouplbr ]  &  0  ,  = fixed  , +  & g^2_ym = ( 2 ) ^p-2 g ^p-3 2 = fixed   +  & x^i = r^i  = fixed with some abuse of the language we will call these `` gauge '' theories on the branes , with the understanding that in the @xmath36 cases we are referring to the theories of coincident m- and ns - branes respectively .",
    "now let us consider the case where we have a nontrivial field strength on the @xmath0 p - branes and we calculate the effective action for the probe",
    ". this calculation will involve diagrams with insertions of the field @xmath37 on the brane .",
    "we expect the result to be gauge invariant , so we expect that @xmath37 only appears through the field strength .",
    "this calculation will involve feynman diagrams as shown in figure 2 which have some number @xmath38 of insertions of the gauge field and some number of loops @xmath39 .",
    "since we have an @xmath39 loop diagram we will have a factor of @xmath40 . the integrals in the diagram will involve some massive particles which have a mass of the order of @xmath41 and this is the only scale that appears in the integrals . assuming that the integrals are convergent we get the following behavior for the diagram with @xmath39 loops and @xmath38 insertions [ powerc ] & g_ym^2l-2 n^lf^i 1 x^l(3-p ) + 2 ( i -2 ) = + &  = f^2 g_ym^2 ( g_ym^2 n f^2",

    "the term @xmath42 indicates some particular contraction of the gauge field strength , both in the ym indices and the lorentz indices .",
    ".5 cm    as an example we can consider the one loop contribution , this can be extracted from the calculations in @xcite and it is a very simple generalization of the calculations done by @xcite .",
    "we refer to those papers for the details .",
    "we will calculate the leading order terms in the field strength @xmath43 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath43 is slowly varying so that we can neglect derivatives , @xmath44 , as well as commutators , @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "commutators are small if covariant derivatives of the fields are small since @xmath46 f \\sim [ f , f ] $ ] .",
    "a similar approach was taken in @xcite to propose a form for the non - abelian generalization of the dirac - born - infeld action .",
    "the diagrams with less than four external lines are zero so that the first nonvanishing contribution is @xcite [ result ] s_1 = & c_7-p8 ( 2)^p x^7-p d^1+p x  \\ { tr [ f _ f^ f _ f^ ] - . + & .",
    "1 4 tr [ f_f^ f_f^ ] }  , where @xmath47 are again ten dimensional indices and @xmath48 is the numerical constant [ defcp ] c_q = ( 4 ) ^q 2 -1 ( q 2 )   .",
    "we see that there are two terms with a structure that is independent of the dimensionality of the brane .",
    "this structure is the same as the structure of the @xmath6 terms in the dirac - born - infeld action @xcite .",
    "the case of branes moving with constant velocity corresponds to @xmath49 and we get @xcite [ vfourth ] s = c_7-p n 8 ( 2 ) ^p r^7-p d^p+1x ( v^2 ) ^2  .",
    "we also see that if @xmath43 describes a bps excitation ( [ result ] ) vanishes .",
    "the two possible bps excitations are traveling waves ( momentum along the brane ) and instantons ( for @xmath50 ) describing a @xmath51 brane inside a @xmath52 brane @xcite . for a traveling wave",
    "we only have @xmath53 where @xmath54 , and both terms in ( [ result ] ) individually cancel . for the case of the instanton",
    "let us denote by @xmath55 the dimensions along which the gauge field is nontrivial ( the four dimensions of the instanton ) . using the self duality condition we find [ simpleinst ] f_ij f^jk = 14 _ ik f_l j f^ j l  , so that the two terms in ( [ result ] ) cancel .",
    "we also obtain a cancellation if we have instantons and traveling waves at the same time .",
    "we expect that if we have a very large number of d - branes the system will be well described by a supergravity solution . this supergravity solution might be singular at @xmath8 , but with a bit of abuse in notation we will call it a black hole , with the understanding that we will be careful about getting very close to @xmath8 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the limit [ bhl ] g 0  ,  n  ,  gn = fixed 1 defines a black hole limit for a system of d - branes that is well described by the corresponding supergravity solution . in this limit",
    "the string coupling is zero in the bulk so we just have free strings in the presence of a nontrivial background metric .",
    "a similar limit can be described for ns fivebranes which is [ bhlns ] g 0  ,  n = fixed 1 in these limits the string theory in the bulk becomes trivial .",
    "one can define a more general black hole limit in which the bulk string coupling is finite . in that case one",
    "needs an additional low energy condition : we take the energies to be much smaller than any other energy scale of the theory and also we take the gravitational radius of the black hole to be much bigger than the inverse of the smallest energy scale of the theory .",
    "this low energy condition ensures that the bulk theory becomes free . in the case of ten dimensional type ii string theories that we were considering above this",
    "means that the energies should be much smaller than @xmath56 and the gravitational radius should be much bigger than @xmath22 .",
    "we could alternatively keep the energies fixed and take the limit [ bhgen ]  0  ,   g ^7-p n = fixed = r_g^7-p    an interesting case to consider is the case of a @xmath57 brane . in that case",
    "we obtain some black hole for any value of @xmath27 .",
    "this supergravity solution is nonsingular , so we could put a probe arbitrarily close to @xmath8 .",
    "we now write the action of a test d - brane in the background black hole that carries d - brane charge @xcite [ classic ] s = - 1 g ( 2)^p ^p+1 2 d^p+1 x   e^- + a_01 ... p  , where @xmath58 is the induced metric on the brane and @xmath59 is the @xmath10 form potential that couples to the d - brane charge .",
    "the background is the corresponding supergravity solution @xcite . for the extremal d-@xmath52-brane solution we find [ class ]",
    "s = - 1 g^2_ym^2 d^p+1 x f^-1 ( -1 )    the function @xmath60 is [ deff ] f = 1 + k^2  ,  k = c_7-p g^2_ym n ( 2)^p x^7-p ( remember that @xmath61 ) .    if we take the gauge theory limit that we took above , keeping @xmath62 fixed , we see that the action becomes [ claslim ] s = - 1g^2_ym d^p+1x k^-1 ( -1 ) where @xmath63 is the derivative of the field measuring transverse displacements ( note that it includes a factor of @xmath64 and has dimensions of @xmath65 )",
    ". there is an interesting connection between ( [ claslim ] ) and the discrete light cone quantization of @xcite . if we compactify the space along the d - brane and we do some duality transformations we can transform the d - brane charge @xmath0 into momentum",
    ". then ( [ claslim ] ) describes the action for a momentum excitation moving close to the extremal black hole carrying momentum charge .",
    "furthermore , the action ( [ claslim ] ) is precisely the action one would obtain in discrete light cone quantization @xcite .",
    "notice that if we expand the action ( [ claslim ] ) we get a series in powers of @xmath66 which is reminiscent of ( [ powerc ] ) .",
    "now the effective action ( [ powerc ] ) will be a good approximation as long as we can neglect the creation of massive strings going between the probe and the black hole .",
    "the mass of such massive strings is @xmath62 and the kinetic energy available is roughly @xmath67 therefore we can neglect massive string creation as long as [ creasup ]    x x^2 1 so we see that if we keep @xmath68 fixed while obeying ( [ creasup ] ) then from the point of view of supergravity we have the action ( [ claslim ] ) and from the point of view the gauge theory we get ( [ powerc ] ) .",
    "this limit demands that @xmath69 , which is saying that the effective large @xmath0 coupling at the energy scale given by @xmath62 is large , so that ( [ creasup ] ) is obeyed and @xmath70 is fixed and finite",
    ". we should also be careful not be close to creating a near extremal black hole .",
    "this would happen when the energy of the probe is such that the probe lies within the schwarzschild radius of the total system consisting of the original extremal branes , plus the probe , plus the energy of the probe .",
    "this condition implies that g_n^10 r^7-p where @xmath71 is the energy density on the probe .",
    "this implies that the following relation should hold 1 in our case this translates into @xmath72 which together with the other conditions that we found above imply that @xmath73 .",
    "viewing the gauge theory diagrams as string diagrams this condition implies that we consider diagrams having only one boundary on the probe but multiple boundaries on the background branes .",
    "it is clear that terms in ( [ powerc ] ) with @xmath74 are not going to contribute while nonzero terms with @xmath75 would spoil any possible agreement , therefore they should vanish .",
    "the terms with @xmath76 should have certain specific coefficients so that the two answers match . in summary",
    ", the correspondence between black holes and supergravity implies that the leading @xmath0 diagrams of @xmath10 dimensional gauge theories should vanish for @xmath77 and should have some specific coefficients for @xmath76 . for the case of zero branes , @xmath78 , and two loops this results",
    "were checked by @xcite .",
    "they considered the case @xmath79 and showed that the first nonvanishing term is proportional to @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) , which has precisely the right coefficient to agree with supergravity .",
    "we can consider cases where the black hole has some excitations , which could be bps or not .",
    "these excitations are described by exciting the gauge field .",
    "we take the excitation energy to be finite in the gauge theory limit .",
    "this implies that the corresponding black hole has one very large charge .",
    "let us consider first bps excitations . for simplicity ,",
    "let s consider the five dimensional case , @xmath32 .",
    "we could have instanton - strings and momentum running along the strings .",
    "the corresponding supergravity background is that of an extremal black hole with three charges . the action of a probe fivebrane becomes [ threech ] s = 1g^2_ym ^2 f^-1_5 ( -1 ) where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the radius of the dimension along the string instanton and the transverse four - volume respectively and @xmath60 is as in ( [ deff ] ) and [ defone ] f_1 = 1 + g^2_ym q_1 v_4",
    "x^2   f_p = 1 + g^4_ym n r^2 v_4 x^2 we see that in the limit @xmath18 the functions ( [ defone ] ) remain finite . in the gauge theory limit we should replace @xmath60 in ( [ threech ] ) by @xmath84 from ( [ deff ] )",
    "this again is the corresponding action that we would have found if we were doing discrete light cone quantization after transforming the fivebrane charge into momentum .",
    "now we could ask if ( [ powerc ] ) has the right structure to give ( [ threech ] ) .",
    "we will analyze this question qualitatively .",
    "we see that we could write @xmath85 and that @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the typical field strength of the instanton configuration and @xmath88 is the typical field strength associated to the excitations carrying momentum .",
    "we indeed see that the whole classical answer ( [ threech ] ) comes from the terms with @xmath89 from ( [ powerc ] ) .    in the case of @xmath90",
    "we get results similar to ( [ threech ] ) but we can only add one extra charge ( breaking another supersymmetry ) .",
    "we can also do a similar analysis for near extremal d-@xmath52-branes . in that case",
    "the black hole solution involves two functions [ nextr ] f = & 1 + k ^2 -12 r_0 ^ 7-p r^7-p + o(^2 /k )  , + g = & 1 - r_0 ^ 7-p r^7-p  , + x_0 ^ 7-p & r^7-p_0 ^7-p = g^4_ym",
    "2 ( 7-p ) ( 2)^p ( 9-p ) where @xmath71 is the energy density on the brane . and",
    "the effective action is [ nexclass ] s = -1g^2_ym^2 d^p+1x +  f^-1 in the gauge theory limit this action becomes [ nexdlcq ] s = - 1g^2_ym d^p+1x +   k^-1  .",
    "expanding ( [ nexdlcq ] ) we obtain an expression of the form ( [ powerc ] ) after identifying @xmath91 . again the terms with @xmath92 are expected to contribute .",
    "actually when we compare the supergravity and the gauge theory we might need to make a change of variables .",
    "this change of variables is not arbitrary , it will be determined by the relative coefficients of the terms proportional to @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the series in ( [ powerc ] ) can be viewed as the @xmath95 limit of some string diagrams .",
    "these are diagrams having @xmath96 holes , one of the holes is attached to the probe d - brane and the @xmath39 others are attached to the black hole .",
    "it is easy analyze the @xmath97 limit of the diagrams , when the branes are very widely separated , since it reduces to a closed string tree level diagram .",
    "this tree level diagram , of course , gives the supergravity result , since the classical low energy action sums up all the tree level diagrams . therefore for @xmath98 the string diagram agrees with the supergravity calculation .",
    "the non - trivial fact is that the string diagram should also agree for @xmath99 .",
    "this seems to imply that the string diagram is the same for short and long distances ( apart from the trivial scaling with @xmath62 already present in ( [ powerc ] ) ) . in principle , the diagram could involve a nontrivial function @xmath100 .",
    "it seems that there could be a non - renormalization argument ( in @xmath22 ) explaining this , but it is unknown to me .",
    "an important fact is that the results are expected to agree with supergravity only after performing an average over all possible microscopic configurations with given charges and masses .",
    "we will see an example of this for a one loop near extremal calculation .",
    "the in the above subsection we indicated that we expect to find agreement order by order in perturbation theory in @xmath27 between the gauge theory diagrams and the long distance supergravity calculation . this implies some perturbative non renormalization theorems that forbid terms with @xmath101 ( at least for large @xmath0 ) . in @xcite",
    "this question was addressed for the @xmath102 ( @xmath6 ) terms .",
    "the conclusion was that for @xmath103 they were not renormalized while for @xmath104 there were nonperturbative corrections .",
    "these corrections are in fact necessary for obtaining type iib string theory from matrix theory @xcite .",
    "these terms arise naturally in the study of the d2 brane black hole solution .",
    "this solution has the feature that the dilaton blows up as we approach the core .",
    "this implies that we should use the 11 dimensional supergravity description . for large @xmath0",
    "the curvatures will be small in the classical solution .",
    "from the 11 dimensional point of view we have m - twobranes perpendicular to @xmath105 . since there is a no force condition we should decide how we distribute the m - twobranes on this circle .",
    "if we just `` lift -up '' the ten dimensional d2-brane solution we obtain a solution in 11 dimensions which would correspond to m2-branes uniformly distributed along @xmath105 . if we add a very small amount of energy this solution would collapse into one in which the branes are all sitting at a point in @xmath105 .",
    "the metric of the m - twobrane solution is [ mtwo ] ds_11 ^ 2 = h^-2/3 dx_||^2 + h^1/3 dx^2 _ where @xmath106 is a harmonic function and @xmath107 indicates the coordinates parallel and perpendicular to the brane respectively . in the case that the branes are all sitting a point in @xmath105",

    "it is precisely for energy scales lower that the coupling constant of the gauge theory that we expect to start flowing into the strong coupling infrared fixed point .",
    "notice also that the physical value of @xmath112 is of the order of @xmath113 at @xmath114 , in other words , the physical value of @xmath105 at the point where the transition happens is much larger that the planck length when @xmath0 is large so that we can trust the classical solution .",
    "it can be seen that for @xmath115 we can rescale the fields ( @xmath116 ) so that @xmath117 disappears from the action and the transverse displacement fields , @xmath118 , have dimension 1/2 , if we are very close to the core of the 11 dimensional m - twobrane solution , @xmath119 , the fact that @xmath105 is compact becomes irrelevant and the action becomes so(8 ) invariant .",
    "this is in agreement with the expectations from matrix theory since in the limit that the coupling is very large we expect to be describing a type iib string theory in ten dimensions @xcite .",
    "the non - perturbative corrections are expected to precisely change the form of the harmonic function from ( [ dtwo ] ) to ( [ harm ] ) .",
    "this is easy to see by using the poisson resumation formula in ( [ harm ] ) .",
    "the necessary exponential corrections go as powers of @xmath120 .",
    "in fact the @xmath121 terms were calculated in @xcite for the one instanton contribution and summed for all instantons in @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "when the transverse displacement field is such that its value is bigger than the energy scale associated to the yang - mills coupling of the 2 + 1 gauge theory we have the effective action expected for d - twobranes in string theory .",
    "when the transverse displacement field has an expectation value comparable to the gauge theory coupling instanton corrections become important and change the behavior such that for expectation values much smaller than the energy scale of the theory we get the conformal fixed point behavior , which is the so(8 ) invariant behavior of an m - twobrane moving in the presence of @xmath0 m - twobranes .    the same kind of transition is expected to happen for the iia theory ns fivebrane . in that case",
    "the transition will happen when the expectation value of the field measuring transverse displacements becomes of order @xmath122 where @xmath22 is the energy scale that characterizes the decoupled iia fivebrane theory . for lower values of @xmath62",
    "we start seeing the 11 dimensional character of the solution and we expect to find an enhanced so(5 ) symmetry , characteristic of the ( 0,2 ) fixed point theory describing m - fivebranes in 11 dimensions .",
    "this is of course describing the limit in which one of the radii of @xmath123 of the original m - theory is going to infinity @xcite .",
    "we summarize some one loop results that show how the different cases mentioned above work .      consider a near extremal black hole .",
    "a probe moving in its presence will feel a static force ( proportional to @xmath124 ) and also a force proportional to @xmath3 . we calculate here the @xmath3 force , leaving the other for the next subsection . instead of taking the probe to be moving we could , of course , take the black hole to be moving .",
    "this term can be calculated by inserting in ( [ result ] ) the field strength @xmath125 where @xmath126 describes the excitations on the brane that raise the brane energy above extremality .",

    "we are just saying that the probe wilson lines do not have a constant time dependence ( @xmath127 ) , in other words : there are no winding fundamental strings dissolved on the probe .",
    "we are also interested in evaluating ( [ twovel ] ) in an average sense . under these conditions the term proportional to @xmath128 in ( [ twovel ] ) does not contribute since it will be proportional to @xmath129 , we can integrate by parts the covariant derivative and then the term vanishes using the equations of motion .",
    "this implies that ( [ twovel ] ) becomes [ twovelfin ] s_2 = c_7-p g^2_ym ( 2)^p x^7-p d^p+1x ^2 2   , where @xmath71 is the energy density on the d - brane .",

    "@xmath32 and we have an extremal state containing @xmath5 instanton strings and momentum @xmath0 .",
    "the total energy on the fivebrane worldvolume is @xcite [ energy ] e = nr + r q_1 g   , so that the probe metric becomes [ twofivedim ] s= & r v g dt v^2 2 ( 1 + g^2 ^4 n r^2 v r^2 .",

    "the calculation of the one loop contribution to the static force reduces to evaluating ( [ result ] ) in some generic thermal ensemble .",
    "this is difficult in principle because we have not calculated the fermionic terms and they will contribute .",
    "we will do the calculation in a case where it is easy to see what the effect of the fermions is .",
    "of course , as explained in @xcite the supergravity solution is expected to agree only in the limit of large @xmath140 . which means that the effective large @xmath0 coupling of the gauge theory is strong .",
    "we will calculate ( [ result ] ) in a configuration carrying the charges of the the five dimensional near extremal black hole of @xcite in the dilute gas regime .",
    "then @xmath32 , we call @xmath141 and we also put @xmath5 instanton strings along one of the directions of the fivebrane , let us call it the direction @xmath142 . even though they are called `` instantons '' these objects are physically string solitons of the 1 + 5 dimensional gauge theory .",
    "the instanton configuration is characterized by some moduli @xmath143 , @xmath144 .",
    "these moduli can oscillate when we move along the direction @xmath142 , @xmath145 .",
    "we are interested in the case where the energy of the oscillations is small , so that we can describe the excitations of the system as oscillations in moduli space .",
    "the condition is that the total energy due to the oscillations should be much smaller than the energy of the instantons @xmath146 .",
    "( in the notation of @xcite this means @xmath147 . )",
    "this picture of the d-1-brane charge being carried by instantons in the gauge theory is correct when the energy of the instantons is much smaller that the total mass of the fivebranes @xmath148 ( this means @xmath149 ) . so that we are in the dilute gas regime of @xcite .",
    "does not require any specific relation between @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "] calling @xmath152 , the nonzero components of the gauge field are @xmath153 with @xmath154 and @xmath155 , the field of the instanton . the action for the small fluctuations of the instanton configuration becomes [ actionfl ] s_0 = & 1 g ( 2)^5  d^1 + 5 x   12 tr [ f_i f^i ] +   fermions   + = & 12 dt dx^9 g_rs ( ) _ ^r ^^s +   fermions  , where @xmath156 .",
    "we have an nonlinear sigma model action for the instanton fluctuations @xcite . the theory ( [ actionfl ] )",
    "has ( 4,4 ) supersymmetry and the metric @xmath157 is hyperkhler @xcite .    using ( [ simpleinst ] )",
    "we can see that the effective action ( [ result ] ) reduces to [ potential ] s_1 = & 2 ( 2)^5 x^2 d^1 + 5 x   tr [ f_+i f_+ i f_-j f_-j ] + +   & + fermions  .",
    "when we integrate over @xmath158 we will effectively average separately the term with @xmath159 and the ones proportional to @xmath160 .",
    "we assume that the oscillations average the fields in such a way that we can replace @xmath161 by its average value , both in spacetime indices and group indices .",
    "so we get [ potentialnew ] s_1 = & 2 ( 2)^5 x^2 dt",

    "@xmath164 are the left and right moving energies of the effective two dimensional theory ( [ actionfl ] ) .",
    "notice that we have calculated only the bosonic terms .",
    "supersymmetry then implies that the fermions appear in ( [ potentialnew ] ) just as another energy contribution .",
    "the form of the operator in ( [ potentialnew ] ) is the identical to the one that appeared in the calculation of the fixed scalars grey - body factors @xcite .",
    "the supergravity calculation ( [ nexdlcq ] ) predicts the static potential [ static ] v = 1 g^2_ym k^-1 ( -1 ) expanding this to first order in @xmath165 we find the one loop contribution . expressing it in terms of the parameters of the five dimensional black hole that we were considering above we see that it exactly matches ( [ potentialnew ] ) .    in this case",
    "we see that if we do not take a typical configuration and average as we did above we would not get agreement with supergravity . for example",
    ", we might take a left moving wave localized at some point in the internal @xmath166 and a right moving one localized at a different point of the internal @xmath166 .",
    "for these excitations ( [ result ] ) would vanish .",
    "of course these configurations do not quite solve the equations of motion , so one can hope that the equations of motion of the excitations along the brane are ergodic , so that the time average is equivalent to a thermodynamic average .",
    "we saw how supergravity solutions demand a certain behavior for large @xmath0 diagrams in gauge theories .",
    "we found that the subleading corrections would be small when we can neglect the open strings stretching between the probe and the black hole .",
    "this correspondence between gauge theory results and supergravity results arises just from the physics of black holes , but can , of course , be of use in matrix theory .",
    "we have checked here this correspondence to one loop in a wide variety of situations , including near extremal black holes . in @xcite",
    "a two loop calculation was done for a special case .",
    "we conjecture that the results will agree up to an arbitrary number of loops .",
    "furthermore we conjecture that the large @xmath0 diagrams that are needed are finite for @xmath167 .",
    "if they were not finite , they should be calculated in the nontrivial ( 0,2 ) theory ( for @xmath30 ) or the the ns fivebrane theory for @xmath32 .",
    "but the definition of these theories themselves as the theories of coincident branes implies that any formulation of the theory , such as the one proposed in @xcite , should be such as to provide agreement for these terms .",
    "all these are the terms needed to show that matrix theory incorporates correctly all nonlinear classical supergravity effects .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the nonlinear form of the action ( [ claslim ] ) is determined by local lorentz invariance . it would be interesting to know what this principle translates into for the gauge theories .",
    "the connection with the string diagrams suggests that these string diagrams should be independent of @xmath22 ( apart from trivial factors ) , so in some sense they are `` topological '' .",
    "this has been verified explicitly for the one loop diagram with four insertions in @xcite .",
    "this also implies many perturbative nonrenormalization theorems protecting the diagrams less than @xmath168 insertions . in principle",
    "one might only need a large @xmath0 non - renormalization theorem .",
    "we expect nonperturbative corrections which have a clear physical interpretation for the @xmath169 case @xcite .",
    "these corrections are saying that a black hole made with d2 branes , when approached closely enough will start having an 11 dimensional character , since the d2 branes become m-2-branes localized along @xmath105 and the local size of @xmath105 is growing as we approach the branes since the dilaton diverges for a d-2-brane .",
    "this of course has a well known matrix theory interpretation as the iib limit of m theory on @xmath170 .",
    "this correspondence between large @xmath0 gauge theories and supergravity will most probably provide new insights both for gravity and gauge large @xmath0 gauge theories that are only beginning to be explored .",
