    "spinning objects have historically been interesting subjects to study .",
    "the spin reversal of the rattleback  @xcite ( also called a celt or wobblestone ) and the behavior of the tippe top are typical examples . in the latter case ,",
    "when a truncated sphere with a cylindrical stem , a so - called ` tippe top ' , is spun sufficiently rapidly on a table with its stem up , it will flip over and rotate on its stem .",
    "this inversion phenomenon has fascinated physicists and has been studied for over a century  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we revisit and study this very classical problem from a different perspective .",
    "recently the riddle of spinning eggs has been resolved by moffatt and shimomura [ ms ] @xcite .",
    "they discovered that if an axisymmetric body , such as a hard - boiled egg , is spun sufficiently rapidly , a ` _ gyroscopic balance _ ' condition ( gbc ) holds and that under this condition the governing equations of the system are much simplified .",
    "in particular , they derived a first - order ordinary differential equation ( ode ) for @xmath8 , the angle between the axis of symmetry and the vertical axis , and showed for the case of a prolate spheroid that the axis of symmetry indeed rises from the horizontal to the vertical .",
    "then the spinning behavior of egg - shaped axisymmetric bodies , whose cross sections are described by several models of oval curves , was studied under the gbc by one of the present authors  @xcite .",
    "the tippe top is also an axisymmetric body and shows the similar behavior as the spinning egg .",
    "then one may ask : does the gbc also hold for the tippe top ?",
    "if so , how is it related to the inversion phenomenon of the tippe top ?",
    "in the first half of this paper we analyze the spinning motion of the tippe top in terms of the gbc .",
    "actually the gbc is not satisfied initially for the tippe top , contrary to the case of the spinning egg .",
    "the difference comes from how we start to spin the object : we spin the tippe top with its stem up , in other words , with its symmetry axis vertical while the egg is spun with its symmetry axis horizontal . in this paper",
    "we perform our analysis taking an eccentric sphere version of the tippe top instead of a commercially available one , a truncated sphere with a cylindrical stem . in order to examine the gbc of the tippe top more closely , we introduce a variable @xmath2 so that @xmath3 corresponds to the gbc , and study the behavior of @xmath2 .",
    "numerical analysis shows that for the tippe tops which will turn over , the variable @xmath2 , starting from a large positive value @xmath9 , soon takes negative values and fluctuates around a negative but small value @xmath10 such that @xmath11 .",
    "thus for these tippe tops , the gbc , which is not satisfied initially , will soon be realized but approximately . on the other hand , in the case of the tippe tops which will not turn over , @xmath2 remains positive around @xmath9 or changes from positive @xmath9 to negative values and then back to positive values close to @xmath9 again .",
    "we find that the behavior of @xmath2 is closely related to the inversion phenomenon of the tippe top .",
    "once @xmath2 fluctuates around the value @xmath12 , the system becomes unstable and starts to turn over .    under the gbc",
    "the governing equations for the tippe top are much simplified and we obtain a first - order ode for @xmath8 , which has the same form as the one derived by ms for the spinning egg . then , this equation for @xmath8 and the geometry lead to the classification of tippe tops into _ three _ groups , depending on the values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are two principal moments of inertia , and @xmath17 is the distance from the center of sphere to the center of mass and @xmath18 is the radius of sphere .",
    "the tippe tops of group i never flip over however large a spin they are given .",
    "those of group ii show a complete inversion and the tippe tops of group iii tend to turn over up to a certain inclination angle @xmath4 such that @xmath5 , when they are spun sufficiently rapidly .",
    "this classification of tippe tops into three groups and its classificatory criteria totally coincide with those obtained by hugenholtz  @xcite and leutwyler  @xcite , both of whom resorted to completely different arguments and methods .    in the latter half of this paper we study the steady states for spinning motion of the tippe top and",
    "examine their stability ( or instability ) .",
    "it is well understood that the main source for the tippe top inversion is sliding friction  @xcite , which depends on the slip velocity @xmath0 of the contact point between the tippe top and a table . often used",
    "is coulomb friction ( see eq.([coulomb ] ) ) .",
    "in fact , coulomb friction is practical when @xmath19 is away from zero , but it is undefined for @xmath20 .",
    "however , we learn that at the steady state of the tippe top , the slip velocity @xmath0 necessarily vanishes . in order to facilitate a linear stability analysis of steady states and also to study the motion of the tippe top as realistically as possible ,",
    "we adopt in our analysis a modified version of coulomb friction ( see eq.([friction ] ) ) , which is continuous in @xmath0 and vanishes at @xmath1 .",
    "actually the steady states of the tippe top and their stability were analyzed by ebenfeld and scheck  [ es ]  @xcite , who assumed a similar frictional force which is continuous at @xmath1 .",
    "they used the total energy of the spinning top as a liapunov function .",
    "the steady states were found as solutions of constant energy . and the stability or instability of these states were judged by examining whether the liapunov function assumes a minimum or a maximum at these states .",
    "also recently , bou - rabee , marsden and romero [ bmr ]  @xcite analyzed the tippe top inversion as a dissipation - induced instability and , using the modified maxwell - bloch equations and an energy - momentum argument , they gave criteria for the stability of the non - inverted and inverted states of the tippe top .",
    "we take a different approach to this problem .",
    "first , in order to find the steady states for spinning motion of the tippe top , we follow the method used by moffatt , shimomura and branicki [ msb ] for the case of spinning spheroids  @xcite",
    ". then the stability of these steady states is examined as follows : once a steady state is known , the system is perturbed around the steady state . particularly we focus our attention on the variable @xmath8 , which is perturbed to @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a value at the steady state and @xmath23 is a small quantity .",
    "using the equations of motion , we obtain , under the linear approximation , a first - order ode for @xmath23 of the form , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is expressed by the values of dynamical variables at the steady state . thus the change of @xmath23 is governed by the sign of @xmath25 .",
    "if @xmath25 is positive ( negative ) , @xmath26 will increase ( decrease ) with time .",
    "therefore , we conclude that when @xmath25 is negative ( positive ) , then the state is stable ( unstable ) . using this new and rather intuitive criterion we argue about the stability of the steady states in terms of the initial spin velocity @xmath6 given at the position near @xmath27 .",
    "we observe that our results on the stability of the steady states are consistent with ones obtained by es and msb .",
    "then we obtain a critical value @xmath7 of the initial spin which is required for the tippe top of group ii to flip over up to the completely inverted position at @xmath28 .",
    "finally we confirm by simulation our results on the relation between the initial spin @xmath6 and the stability of the steady states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .  2 we explain the notation and geometry used in this paper , and give all the necessary equations for the analysis of the spinning motion of the tippe top .",
    "in sec .  3 we discuss about the gbc and its relevance to the inversion phenomenon of the tippe top .",
    "we also show that the assumption of the gbc leads to the classification of tippe tops into three groups . then in sec .",
    "4 we study the steady states for the spinning motion of the tippe top and examine their stability .",
    "is devoted to a summary and discussion .",
    "in addition , we present four appendices . in appendix",
    "a , the equations of motion which are used to analyze the spinning motion of the tippe top are enumerated . in appendix b , it is shown that intermediate steady states for the tippe tops of group ii and group iii are stable when an initial spin @xmath29 falls in a certain range . in appendix c",
    "we demonstrate that our stability criterion for the steady state is equivalent to the one obtained by es . and",
    "finally , in appendix d , we show that our results on the stability of the vertical spin states are consistent with the criteria derived by bmr .",
    "a commercially available tippe top is usually a truncated sphere with a cylindrical stem .",
    "instead we perform our analysis taking a loaded ( eccentric ) sphere version of the tippe top .",
    "the center of mass is off center by a distance @xmath17 .",
    "there are no qualitative differences between the two .",
    "but if applied to the case of a commercial tippe top with a stem , our assertions would be valid up to the point when the stem touched the table surface .     a loaded sphere ( eccentric ) version of the tippe top .",

    "we choose the horizontal axis @xmath38 in the plane @xmath35 and thus @xmath46 is vertical to @xmath35 and inward .    in a rotating frame of reference @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is in the plane @xmath35 and perpendicular to the symmetry axis @xmath33 and where @xmath49 coincides with @xmath46 , the tippe top spins about @xmath33 with the rate @xmath50 .",

    "we consider only _ the situation in which the tippe top is always in contact with the table _ throughout the motion .",

    "when we play with a tippe top , we usually give it a rapid spin with its axis of symmetry nearly vertical .",

    ", we take @xmath109 since we usually do not give a large translational motion to the tippe top at the beginning .    with the above initial conditions ( [ initialrotation ] ) and ( [ initialtrans ] )",
    ", we analyze the behaviors of the tippe top using three angular ( [ euleromega]-[eulern ] ) and three translational ( [ eqcmx]-[eqcmz ] ) equations of motion , together with the knowledge of the frictional force , a modified version of the coulomb law ( [ friction ] ) , and the velocities ( [ vpx]-[vpz ] ) and ( [ velp ] ) . when we perform simulations we use the adaptive runge - kutta method .",
    "we define a variable @xmath2 as @xmath110 in terms of @xmath2 , the @xmath111- and @xmath104- components of @xmath60 in ( [ angulareqs ] ) and jellett s constant @xmath112 , ( [ jellettconstant ] ) , are expressed , respectively , as @xmath113    the condition @xmath3 has been introduced by ms  @xcite in their analysis of spinning hard - boiled eggs , and referred to as the gbc .",
    "they discovered that the gbc , @xmath3 , is approximately satisfied for the spinning egg and , using this gbc , they resolved a long standing riddle : when a hard - boiled egg is spun sufficiently rapidly on a table with its axis of symmetry horizontal , the axis will rise from the horizontal to the vertical .",
    "we outline how ms found the gbc for the spinning egg  @xcite . the system of the spinning egg obeys essentially the same equations of motion as the case of the tippe top , to be specific , eqs .",
    "( [ euler ] ) and ( [ eqcm ] ) .",
    "the @xmath114-component of ( [ euler ] ) for the spinning egg is given by ( [ eulertheta ] ) , with the factor , @xmath115 , being replaced by @xmath116 . because the secular change of @xmath8 is slow and",
    "thus @xmath117 , the term @xmath118 can be neglected .",
    "furthermore , in a situation where @xmath119 is sufficiently large so that the terms involving @xmath76 in ( [ eulertheta ] ) dominate the terms @xmath120 and @xmath121 , eq .",

    "hence , for @xmath123 , we arrive at the condition @xmath124 .",
    "the tippe top shows the similar behavior as the spinning egg .",
    "then one may ask : does the gbc also hold for the tippe top ? we will show that the answer is  partly no \" and  partly yes \" .  partly no \" means that the gbc is not satisfied initially .",
    "tippe tops are usually spun with @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and large @xmath127 and , therefore , @xmath128 is large , from which we find that @xmath129 is large[multiblock footnote omitted ] .",
    "thus the gbc does not hold at the beginning .",
    "however , we will see later that the gbc does approximately hold whenever the tippe top rises , which is the meaning of  partly yes \" . in fact , the argument of ms to derive the gbc for the spinning egg can also be applied to the tippe top .",
    "thus in a situation where @xmath76 is sufficiently large and for @xmath123 , the gbc is expected to be satisfied . on the other hand , in the case of the spinning egg",
    ", the gbc is approximately satisfied initially .",
    "we start to spin an egg with its symmetry axis horizontal , that is , with @xmath130 , @xmath131 and large @xmath132 .",
    "hence we find @xmath133 and @xmath134 for the spinning egg .",
    "we emphasize that the variable @xmath2 initially takes a large positive value for the tippe top .",
    "but our numerical analysis will show that when a tippe top turns over , @xmath2 soon makes a rapid transition from large positive values to negative values and starts to oscillate about a small negative value .    before proceeding with a discussion of this transition of @xmath2 ,",
    "let us consider the consequences when the gbc is exactly satisfied for the tippe top .",
    "in a situation where @xmath76 is sufficiently large and @xmath8 is not in the vicinity of 0 or @xmath135 , the gbc is realized for the tippe top .",
    "let us consider the case that the exact gbc , @xmath136 , is satisfied for the tippe top .",
    "then , we have @xmath137 from ( [ jellettconstant2 ] ) , and @xmath138 from the second equation in ( [ angulareqs2 ] ) .",
    "if the angular velocity @xmath76 around the vertical axis is reduced and , therefore , @xmath139 decreases , eq.([gbcjellett ] ) tells us that the height @xmath74 of the center of mass from the table increases since @xmath112 is a constant , which means the turning over of the tippe top . differentiating both sides of ( [ gbcjellett ] ) by time and using ( [ height.b ] ) and ( [ eulerz ] )",
    ", we obtain a first - order ode for @xmath8 , @xmath140    we assume also that the @xmath114-component of @xmath141 , the translational velocity of the center of mass @xmath30 , in ( [ velp ] ) is negligible in the first approximation as compared with that of @xmath81 , and we set @xmath142 . we see that numerical simulation supports this assumption",
    "then , one can use eq .",
    "( [ vpy ] ) and the gbc to eliminate @xmath77 and @xmath76 , and obtain @xmath143 as only a function of the dynamical variable @xmath8 as follows : @xmath144 since the frictional force @xmath145 is proportional to @xmath143 , we obtain from eqs.([equfortheta]-[vpsecond ] ) , @xmath146 with a _ positive _ proportional coefficient and @xmath147 equation ( [ equtheta ] ) implies that the change of @xmath8 is governed by the sign of @xmath148 .",
    "if @xmath148 is positive ( negative ) , then @xmath8 will increase ( decrease ) with time .",
    "therefore a close examination of the behavior of @xmath148 as a function of @xmath8 will be important . ) to a renormalization group equation which appears in quantum field theories for critical phenomena and high energy physics is emphasized in sec .",
    "we observe from ( [ vpytilde ] ) that @xmath149 at @xmath150 and @xmath135 , since @xmath151 at these angles .",
    "moreover , @xmath148 may vanish at an other angle , which is given by solving @xmath152 equation ( [ vpzero ] ) has a solution for @xmath8 if @xmath153 or @xmath154 and no solution otherwise . accordingly , tippe tops are classified into three groups , depending on the values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 : group i with @xmath153 ; group ii with @xmath155 ; and group iii with @xmath154 .",
    "we now examine the behaviors of tippe tops belonging to each group .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     from these numerical analyses we see that the behavior of @xmath2 is closely related to the inversion phenomenon of the tippe top .",
    "as the tippe top turns over , simulation shows that @xmath2 becomes small ( in the sense @xmath156 ) and takes values close to @xmath157 , which implies that the relation ( [ gbcjellett ] ) is approximately satisfied .",
    "conversely , when the relation ( [ gbcjellett ] ) holds , it means that the center of mass of the tippe top goes up as @xmath139 decreases .",
    "in sec.3.2 we have studied the behaviors of the spinning tippe top when the gyroscopic balance condition @xmath3 is exactly satisfied .",
    "the situation corresponds to the one in which the tippe top is given an infinitely large initial spin .",
    "actually the initial spin given to the tippe top is finite and we know empirically that a tippe top with a small spin is stable and does not turn over .",
    "we will now consider how large an initial spin should be for the tippe top to turn over .",
    "for that purpose we will study the steady states of the tippe top and examine their stability .    actually the steady states ( or the asymptotic states ) of the tippe top and their stability",
    "were analyzed by ebenfeld and scheck [ es ]  @xcite .",
    "they used the total energy of the spinning top as a liapunov function .",
    "then the steady states were found as solutions of constant energy .",
    "the stability or instability of these states was determined by examining whether the liapunov function assumes a minimum or a maximum at these states under the constraint of jellett s constant .",
    "the tippe top inversion was also analyzed recently by bou - rabee , marsden and romero [ bmr ]  @xcite as a dissipation - induced instability .",
    "bmr used the modified maxwell - bloch equations and an energy - momentum argument to determine the stability of the non - inverted and inverted states of the tippe top . here",
    "we take a different approach to this problem . and",
    "we discuss the stability of the steady states in terms of the initial spin velocity @xmath77 given at the non - inverted position @xmath27 .",
    "recently , moffatt , shimomura and branicki [ msb ] made a linear stability analysis of the spinning motion of spheroids  @xcite .",
    "they identified the steady states , and then discussed their stability and found the critical angular velocity needed for the rise of the body . in order to find the steady states of the spinning tippe top , we adopt the method taken by msb for the case of spheroids .",
    "but for the stability analysis of the steady states , we develop a new stability criterion which is different from the ones used by es , bmr and msb .",
    "our approach to the stability problem of the tippe top is as follows .",
    "once a steady state is known , the system is perturbed around the steady state .",
    "particularly we focus our attention on the variable @xmath8 , which is perturbed to @xmath158 where @xmath22 is a value at the steady state and @xmath23 is a small quantity . using the equations of motion , we obtain , under the linear approximation , a first - order ode for @xmath23 of the following form : @xmath159 where @xmath160 and @xmath161 are values taken at the steady state . equation ( [ eqforstability ] ) implies that the change of @xmath23 is governed by the sign of the function @xmath162 . if @xmath162 is positive ( negative ) , @xmath26 will increase ( decrease ) with time .",
    "therefore , we conclude that _ when @xmath162 is negative ( positive ) , then the state is stable ( unstable)_. this is the criterion for stability of the steady state , which we will use in this paper .",
    "the stability criterion in this work is derived from an intuitive analysis of the equations of motion .",
    "we check in appendices c and d that they are consistent with those derived by es and bmr which are based on mathematically rigorous methods .",
    "superficially the above criterion ( [ eqforstability ] ) seems quite different from the one used by es  @xcite , but actually we have found that both are equivalent and , therefore , our results are consistent with theirs . in appendix c",
    "we will show the equivalence of both criteria and that the stability conditions of the steady states which we will obtain coincide with the ones found by es .",
    "after all , es utilized the total energy ( an integral form )  @xcite , while we will use equations of motion ( differential forms ) .",
    "the criterion ( [ eqforstability ] ) for the stability of the tippe top also seems different from the ones used by bmr  @xcite , which were derived from the tippe top modified maxwell - bloch equations . in order to obtain the stability criteria ,",
    "both bmr and we linearize equations of motion about the steady states and use sliding friction , which is assumed to be an analytic function of the slip velocity , as the main mechanism behind tippe top inversion .",
    "thus it is well expected that both criteria lead to the consistent results on the stability of the non - inverted and inverted states .",
    "( the stability of the intermediate states have not been analyzed yet by means of the modified maxwell - bloch equations ) . in appendix",
