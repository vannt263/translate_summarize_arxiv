    "that is the non - conservation of the spin in solids .",
    "this limits the range of the spin transmission to be less than the spin diffusion length , which is typically @xmath3 m scale in metals .",
    "the non - conservation of the spins is expressed by a source term in the continuity equation for the spin @xmath4 here @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the spin density and spin current , respectively , @xmath7 is the spin direction and @xmath0 is the spin relaxation torque resulting in the non - conservation of the spin . in the most cases in metals ,",

    "it has so far been treated only on the phenomenological ground .",
    "the continuity equation is equivalent to the boltzmann equation , which is useful in discussing the spin transports .",

    "@xcite and later by valet and fert @xcite in the context of the giant magnetoresistance in multilayer systems . in their analysis",
    ", they approximated the spin relaxation torque as proportional to the inverse of a spin relaxation time @xmath8 and to some unknown function representing a driving force for the spin accumulation .",
    "the driving force was written in terms of what they called the spin chemical potential @xmath9 .",
    "the relaxation torque was approximated as @xmath10 .",
    "they argued that @xmath9 satisfies the diffusion equation , @xmath11 , with the diffusion length @xmath12 .",
    "microscopic calculation for @xmath9 has not been done so far .    the diffusion equation for the spin has been widely used to discuss recent spin transports in metallic junctions @xcite .",
    "the decay of spin transport has been confirmed in non - local spin injection experiments @xcite , which indicate that the spin diffusion decays with a decay length of 350 - 500 nm in cu and 100 nm in au at room temperature .",
    "although the spin diffusion equation appears to be so far successful , the phenomenological treatment of the spin relaxation term and the spin chemical potential must be improved to consider the spin transport seriously .    besides diffusive spin current",
    ", there is another spin current that is driven by an effective field .",
    "in contrast to the diffusive one , this field - driven contribution should not decay in uniform ( single domain ) ferromagnets , since the ratio of the spin current and the charge current is determined by the spin polarization ratio of the material , which is a statistical mechanical quantity . the field - driven ( local ) spin current and the diffusive spin current behave differently , as was recently demonstrated theoretically in the case of the inverse spin hall effect @xcite .    in the field of the current - driven magnetization dynamics ,",

    "when the spin - relaxation sets in , the conduction electron no longer follows the magnetization profile , and new contribution to the torque arises from the @xmath0 term .",
    "this torque was shown to be @xmath17 where @xmath1 is a coefficient inversely proportional to the spin relaxation time @xmath18 @xcite .",

    "the magnitude of the parameter @xmath1 has recently been intensively studied experimentally by measuring the domain wall speed under current @xcite . theoretical formulation for estimating @xmath1 in the first - principles calculations",
    "was carried out recently @xcite .",
    "the spin relaxation torque has been studied also from the viewpoint of how to define the spin current .",
    "it was discussed that the spin relaxation torque contains a term written as a divergence of the torque dipole density , @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "generalized argument was given by shi et al .",
    "@xcite , where they discussed that the @xmath20 component of the relaxation torque is written as a divergence , @xmath21 if the system has the inversion symmetry .",
    "this means that the total torque integrated over the system should vanish .",
    "shi et al . also argued that if the relaxation torque is a divergence of @xmath19 , one can define a spin current that is conserved .",
    "in fact , defining @xmath22 , the continuity equation ( [ sconteq ] ) reduces to @xmath23 .",
    "the explicit form of the torque dipole density was not calculated in ref .",
    "obviously , in the presence of the inhomogeneity of the magnetization , the @xmath1 torque ( ) can not be written as a divergence , and thus it indeed represents the spin angular momentum lost by the spin relaxation .",
    "the result that the spin relaxation torque is given by a derivative of the applied electric field @xmath24 is understood as follows .",
    "the spin relaxation torque should of course vanish when @xmath25 .",
    "it can not be directly proportional to @xmath24 , since field - driven spin current in uniform ferromagnets should not decay .",
    "therefore , the simplest expression for the relaxation torque is a derivative of the field .",
    "it is not , however , obvious whether it should be always written in a rotationally invariant way , or if it can be anisotropic , since the rotational invariance is broken in uniform ferromagnets because of the magnetization .",
    "the first aim of the present paper is to calculate the spin relaxation torque microscopically in the presence of the applied electric field .",
    "the spin relaxation mechanism we take into account is the spin - orbit interaction due to random impurities .",
    "our explicit calculation reveals that the spin relaxation torque is not always rotationally symmetric in uniform ferromagnets , but is generally given by @xmath26 where @xmath20 axis is along the magnetization , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are coefficient proportional to the inverse spin relaxation time .",
    "the spin relaxation torque is , therefore , anisotropic .",

    "these anisotropic behaviors of the transport quantities is common when spin - orbit interaction exists , as is well - known in charge transport as the anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr ) @xcite .",
    "the second aim of the paper is to study the spin current on the same microscopic footing as the relaxation torque .",
    "we show that the spin current is made up of a field - driven contribution which is local and the diffusive one with nonlocality .",
    "the field - driven contribution is anisotropic like the amr effect for the charge current ( we call the effect as spin amr effect ) .",
