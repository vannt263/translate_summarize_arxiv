    "feynman s path integral ( see e.g.  @xcite ) provides a convenient way to represent the propagator of a quantum mechanical system , and an excellent starting point for semiclassical and related approximations .",
    "prime examples are van vleck s approximation of the propagator of a quantum system as a sum over contributions of classical trajectories @xcite , and gutzwiller s seminal work @xcite relating the energy spectrum of chaotic single - particle systems to periodic classical trajectories .",
    "these semiclassical methods provide one of the foundations of the field of quantum chaos @xcite . for a many - particle system identifying the semiclassical limit",
    "is less obvious .",
    "a promising approach is to consider the path integral in second quantisation , running over different choices for the macroscopic wave function parameterised by position and time .",
    "one can show that in the semiclassical limit and in the limit where the number of particles @xmath0 is taken to infinity this path integral is dominated by stationary points of the action , corresponding to solutions of the nonlinear schrdinger equation or gross - pitaevski equation .",
    "these solutions take on a role analogous to the one played by classical trajectories in the single - particle theory .",
    "however previous work usually focused either on studying the full problem in second quantisation or , as e.g. in nuclear dynamics @xcite , on _ one _ dominating solution to the gross - pitaevski equation @xcite .",
    "this does not exhaust the power of the approximation .",
    "in particular keeping the sum over different solutions of the gross - pitaevski equation allows to account for crucial interference effects between such solutions .",
    "an approach where the semiclassical propagator of bosonic many - particle systems was used to study these effects was pioneered in @xcite for coherent backscattering , see also @xcite for applications to fermionic systems .    in the present paper",
    "we will focus on a further fundamental problem for which the interference between stationary points of second quantised path integrals is of vital importance : the statistics of the energy levels of many - body systems . to do",
    "so we will first derive an approximation of the level density in terms of stationary points of the action , and then study the interference between these points . to our knowledge",
    "the consequences of interference effects for many - body spectral statistics have not yet been investigated explicitly .",
    "we will see that this statistics depends crucially on the dynamics generated by the gross - pitaevski equation .",
    "if the dynamics is fully chaotic ( in the sense to be specified below ) the statistics in the limits considered becomes universal , and agrees with predictions from random - matrix theory ( rmt ) .",
    "these predictions entail , for instance , a repulsion between the energy levels .",
    "this universal behaviour mirrors the behaviour of chaotic single - particle systems studied in the semiclassical limit . for such systems",
    "spectral statistics faithful to random matrix theory was conjectured in @xcite , and a semiclassical explanation was developed in @xcite .",
    "this explanation is based on gutzwiller s trace formula @xcite @xmath1 which expresses the level density as a smooth term @xmath2 plus fluctuations associated to classical periodic orbits @xmath3 ( with energy @xmath4 ) of the system . here",
    "@xmath5 is the reduced action of the orbit given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the vector of generalised coordinates and @xmath8 denotes the associated momentum .",
    "the amplitude @xmath9 depends on the primitive period @xmath10 , the so - called maslov index @xmath11 and the stability matrix @xmath12 relating deviations in the end of the orbit @xmath3 to deviations in the beginning ; @xmath13 is a unit matrix .",
    "( throughout this paper @xmath13 will denote unit matrices with a subscript indicating their size if it is not clear from context . )",
    "our first aim will be to generalise the trace formula to bosonic many - particle systems in second quantisation , with solutions of the gross - pitaevski equation taking the role of classical trajectories .",
    "we will then use this result to investigate spectral statistics .",
    "an observable characterising spectral statistics is the two - point correlation function of the level density @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 are the energy levels of the system ) .",
    "this correlation function is defined by @xmath16 where the average @xmath17 is taken over an interval of @xmath4 for which @xmath18 can be taken constant as well as over a small range of @xmath19 . inserting the trace formula",
    "one obtains a double sum over solutions of the gross - pitaevski equation , and by taking into account interference between solutions we indeed recover statistics in agreement with rmt .",
    "more precisely this agreement holds for the statistics inside appropriate subspectra defined by the symmetries of the problem ; for many - body systems we have at least one symmetry , particle number conservation , requiring to consider subspectra associated to a fixed particle number .",
    "further refinements ( to be discussed below ) arise in case of geometrical symmetries .",
    "the precise ensemble to be chosen depends on the behaviour of the system under time reversal .",
    "the most frequent case involves systems invariant under a time - reversal operator squaring to 1 . in this case",
    "( assuming that there are no further symmetries ) one has to use wigner s and dyson s gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) , i.e. predictions for spectral statistics are obtained by modelling the hamiltonian through a real symmetric matrix , and then averaging over all possible such matrices with a gaussian weight . in the absence of time - reversal invariance one averages instead over the ensemble of hermitian matrices with a gaussian weight , the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) .",
    "a paradigmatic example for the systems to be considered is the bose - hubbard model , a model with @xmath20 discrete sites ( labelled by @xmath21 ) accommodating bosonic particles . denoting the creation and annihilation operators for particles at these sites by @xmath22 and",
    "@xmath23 the second - quantised hamiltonian can be written as @xmath24 describing hopping between the sites as well as interaction between particles on the same site .",
    "one can consider periodic boundary conditions and set @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "more generally we are interested in discrete bosonic many - body hamiltonians that are of the form @xmath27 or have even higher - order interactions ; here real coefficients imply time - reversal invariance .",
    "a crucial requirement is that the underlying ` classical dynamics ' is chaotic .",
    "this dynamics is obtained by replacing the creation and annihilation operators by mutually complex conjugate time dependent variables @xmath28 , @xmath29 where @xmath30 can be interpreted as a macroscopic wave function and @xmath29 as its value at site @xmath31 .",
    "as @xmath32 is the particle number operator , the macroscopic wave function is normalised to have @xmath33 where @xmath0 is the particle number .",
    "the associated analogue of hamilton s equations for @xmath29 can be shown to read @xmath34 and takes the role of a discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "we note that the ` classical ' hamiltonian entering into this equation depends on the ordering of operators . for the bose - hubbard model the normal - ordered hamiltonian in ( [ bh ] )",
    "yields an interaction term @xmath35 ; however if the hamiltonian is first brought to weyl - ordered form ( with all possible orderings of operators in a product contributing symmetrically ) before replacing the operators by macroscopic wave functions one obtains @xmath36 .    for the bose - hubbard model",
    "the dynamics generated by the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation has been found to be mainly chaotic ( with chaotic regions of phase space dominating compared to regular ones ) in the case of several sites and comparable hopping and interaction terms @xcite . in the same regime ,",
    "numerical studies suggest spectral statistics in line with the goe @xcite ; see also @xcite for fermionic systems .",
    "in order to prepare our derivation of a trace formula for bosonic many - particle systems , we want to briefly review the calculation leading to the trace formula for single - body systems .",
    "we refer to @xcite for further details .",
    "the level density can be accessed from the trace of the time evolution operator @xmath37 via @xmath38 where an infinitesimal positive imaginary part has been added to the energy to ensure convergence .",
    "the trace of the time evolution operator can itself be expressed as a path integral over phase space trajectories @xmath39 @xmath40e^{ir[{\\boldsymbol{q}},{\\boldsymbol{p}}]/\\hbar},\\ ] ] where the action weighting each path is determined by the classical hamiltonian @xmath41 as@xmath42=\\int_0^t dt ' \\left({{\\boldsymbol{p}}(t')}\\cdot\\dot{{\\boldsymbol{q}}}(t')-h({\\boldsymbol{q}}(t'),{\\boldsymbol{p}}(t ' ) ) \\right).\\ ] ] now we are interested in an approximation of this path integral in the , i.e. , the limit of large implying that typical classical actions are much larger than @xmath43 ; formally this limit is often denoted by @xmath44 in the semiclasssical limit the path integral is dominated by stationary points of the action , corresponding to periodic orbits that satisfy hamilton s equations of motion , and a stationary - phase approximation leads to a discrete sum over such periodic orbits . for chaotic dynamics , free from continuous symmetries ,",
    "the periodic orbits are isolated but one has to take into account that each of them formally gives rise to a one - parameter family of stationary points distinguished by which phase - space point along the orbit is taken as the initial one associated to @xmath45 .",
    "the laplace transform in ( [ def_d_e ] ) can then be carried out in a further stationary - phase approximation and one obtains the trace formula @xmath46 already shown earlier . here the determinant and the phase factor involving the maslov index arise from the hessian matrix of the action entering the stationary - phase approximation , and the factor @xmath47 results from integration over different choices of initial points .",
    "the summand @xmath2 can be derived from a careful treatment of the lower limit of the time integral ( [ def_d_e ] ) .",
    "we now want to generalise the trace formula to many - particle systems in second quantisation , for the case of bosonic particles at discrete sites . in second quantisation",
    "it is natural to work in a basis of coherent states , i.e. , normalised joint eigenstates of all annihilators @xmath23 with eigenvalues @xmath29 .",
    "further differences from the single - particle setting arise from operator ordering as well as the conservation of the particle number .",
    "again we access the level density from the trace of the time evolution operator @xmath37 using ( [ def_d_e ] ) . for many - particle systems",
    "the latter trace is given by the path integral @xcite @xmath48e^{ir[{\\boldsymbol{\\psi}},{\\boldsymbol{\\psi}}^*]/\\hbar}\\ ] ] over all macroscopic wave functions @xmath49 that return to their initial value after time @xmath50 . here",

    "( [ path ] ) is related to but somewhat simpler than the path integral for matrix elements of coherent state time evolution operator @xcite ; our use of @xmath52 is motivated by @xcite .    in case of _ normal ordering _ the path integral can be derived by splitting the time interval @xmath50 into @xmath53 steps of width @xmath54 and then using the result for the short - time propagator @xmath55 after integration over the macroscopic wave functions at all time steps this leads to a discrete path integral with the action @xmath56=",

    "will be a time index , @xmath31 will label degrees of freedom e.g. associated to sites , and bold vectors assemble all choices for @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath58 is defined modulo @xmath53 and @xmath31 is taken modulo @xmath20 . with these conventions the integration measure in the path integral is given by @xmath59 .",
    "the integral thus obtained agrees with the phase - space formulation of the path integral in first quantisation if the macroscopic wave function is related to canonical coordinates and momenta through @xmath60 or @xmath61 . we can now perform a semiclassical approximation valid in the limit @xmath62 . here",
    "@xmath29 is taken of the order @xmath63 such that the first term in the action ( [ r1 ] ) becomes independent of @xmath43 ; ( we will later also give an interpretation in terms of the limit @xmath64 . ) in our limit the integral is dominated by periodic solutions of the nonlinear schrdinger equation @xmath65 ( and its complex conjugate ) following from the stationarity of @xmath66 .",
    "importantly , however , our hamiltonian has a continuous ( gauge ) symmetry w.r.t . multiplying all components of the macroscopic wave function with the same phase factor .",
    "a consequence of this symmetry is that as mentioned the total particle number @xmath67 is a conserved quantity commuting with the hamiltonian .",
    "it is thus preferable to consider the density of levels forming the subspectrum associated to a fixed particle number .    to implement this restriction we subject the @xmath68 defined above to a canonical transformation .",
    "( see @xcite for alternative approaches . )",
    "this transformation is chosen to lead to @xmath69 where @xmath70 , the remaining @xmath71 are linear combinations of the @xmath72 , and the @xmath73 are defined such that the overall transformation becomes canonical .",
    "if we choose the transformation in such a way that the range of possible @xmath74 is limited to @xmath75 it is also convenient to let @xmath76 .",
    "as @xmath77 is a conserved quantity the corresponding canonical coordinate @xmath78 must be absent from the hamiltonian .",
    "the remaining variables with @xmath79 parameterise a _ reduced phase space _ associated to the particle number @xmath0 .",
    "we are interested in the part of the spectrum associated to a given value @xmath0 of the particle number .",
    "the associated level density can be formally written as @xmath80 with the kronecker delta @xmath81 as one might expect , @xmath82 is determined by solutions periodic in the reduced phase space . to see this formally we split the exponential @xmath83 from ( [ kronecker ] ) into factors @xmath84 to be inserted into each of the short - time propagators ( [ matel ] ) .",
    "this gives an additional term @xmath85=\\sum_j\\frac{\\hbar\\phi}{{\\cal j}}\\psi_{j+1,0}'^*\\psi_{j,0}'\\ ] ] to be added to the action , leading to @xmath86=\\int_0^tdt'\\frac{\\hbar\\phi}{t}|\\psi'_0(t')|^2\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath57 .",
    "the phase now becomes stationary if @xmath87 where the addition only affects the dynamics of @xmath78 , replacing it by @xmath88 hence , as anticipated , the requirement of periodicity is nontrivial only for the variables @xmath89 with @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath90 is conserved and hence trivially periodic , and @xmath91 is required to be periodic only after modifying the dynamics through the @xmath92-dependent term in the action , but all possible choices of @xmath92 are integrated over .",
    "we now have to determine the weight associated to each periodic solution .",
    "we recall that if the stationary points @xmath3 of a given action @xmath93 $ ] ( with @xmath94 for now ) are isolated and we are taking the limit @xmath62 , the integral over @xmath95 can be approximated by the following sum over contributions associated to stationary points , @xmath96/\\hbar}\\approx \\sum_p(2\\pi i)^{n/2}\\big|\\det\\frac{1}{\\hbar}\\frac{\\partial^2 r_p}{\\partial{\\boldsymbol{x}}^2}\\big|^{-1/2}e^{ir_p/\\hbar - i\\mu_p\\frac{\\pi}{2}};\\ ] ] here @xmath11 is the number of the negative eigenvalues of the hessian matrix @xmath97 for the stationary point @xmath3 .",
    "if the stationary points are not isolated this leads to vanishing eigenvalues of the hessian . in this case",
    "the integral over the directions orthogonal to the stationary - point manifold can still be computed using ( [ sphase ] ) , but it has to be accompanied by an integral over the manifold itself .",
    "the stationary points of ( [ rdisc ] ) are not isolated .",
    "in particular continuous time shifts of a solution of the nonlinear schrdinger equation lead to a different solution , and the same applies to simultaneous shifts of all @xmath98 .",
    "this is a consequence of the two conserved quantities , for the energy conjugate to time and the particle number conjugate to the @xmath98 .",
    "however as a first step it is still helpful to compute the ( rescaled ) hessian involving derivatives w.r.t .",
    "all components of the macroscopic wave functions at all time steps . adopting a complex notation we consider @xmath99 using the discretised action ( [ rdisc ] ) the derivatives are given by @xmath100 where @xmath101 is a unit matrix of dimension @xmath20 .",
    "the hessian w.r.t .",
    "these variables then assumes periodic block tridiagonal form @xmath102 where @xmath103 and the blocks are matrices of size @xmath104 given by @xmath105 here we neglected corrections of order @xmath106 arising from the fact that the arguments of the hamiltonian in ( [ hessian ] ) are taken at slightly different times .",
    "we can now use a general formula for determinants of block tridiagonal matrices as in ( [ tridiag ] ) that was derived in @xcite using a transfer matrix approach , @xmath107 here we have @xmath108 in eqs .",
    "( [ det ] ) , ( [ det2 ] ) we have slightly modified the numbering of indices from @xcite and taken the dimension of the block matrices as @xmath20 .",
    "due to @xmath103 the sign factor in ( [ det ] ) is just equal to 1 . to evaluate @xmath109 we group the factors in ( [ det2 ] ) into pairs @xmath110 which using ( [ derivs ] ) can be simplified to @xmath111 when deriving the trace formula in _ normal ordering _",
    "the determinant of the hessian of @xmath112 was evaluated using @xcite @xmath113 where the blocks are of dimension @xmath114 and we have @xmath115 in the present case the non - vanishing blocks correspond to the components of the hessian given in ( [ hessian ] ) .",
    "we have @xmath103 , @xmath116 implying that the sign factor is always equal to 1 .",
    "a short calculation shows that @xmath117 assumes the form claimed in the main text if one combines the present factors pairwise and drops corrections beyond linear order in @xmath118 ; this includes corrections that originate from the difference between @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "one can now show that multiplication with @xmath121 maps small deviations @xmath122 from a given solution of the nonlinear schrdinger equation at time @xmath123 to the resulting deviation at time @xmath124 .",
    "this follows immediately by linearizing around the equation @xmath125 and its complex conjugate .",
    "hence the product @xmath126 ( understood in the limit @xmath57 ) maps deviations in at time 0 to those at time @xmath50 .",
    "the matrix @xmath127 is given by @xmath128 evaluating its determinant and taking the continuum limit then leads to @xmath129 the factor @xmath130 arising from this term in @xmath131 is known as the solari - kochetov ( sk ) phase ; it is in line with previous work about the propagator in normal ordering @xcite .",
    "we now modify our treatment to take into account particle number and energy conservation .",
    "for notational convenience it is helpful to complement our earlier canonical transformation singling out the particle number by a further transformation affecting only the variables with @xmath79 .",
    "this transformation is defined only in the vicinity of a periodic solution and leads to @xmath132 indicating the energy on the orbit , and @xmath133 the time along the orbit .",
    "the remaining variables @xmath134 with @xmath135 indicate transverse deviations from this orbit .",
    "if desired they can again be turned into complex variables @xmath89 as above to @xmath75 . ] , and the vector formed by all @xmath89 with @xmath136 will be denoted by @xmath137 . the present transformation is analogous to the transformation to parallel and perpendicular coordinates in the derivation of the trace formula in first quantisation @xcite .",
    "we note that it can not be expanded to a transformation in the full phase space as this would imply integrability .    when determining the weight associated to periodic solutions , it is now crucial to take into account that shifting all time coordinates @xmath138 by the same amount leads to a valid solution , and the same applies to coordinated changes of the variables @xmath98 conjugate to the particle number .",
    "hence there are two linearly independent ways in which _ continuous _ changes from one stationary point of the action lead to a different one .",
    "as second derivatives of the action in the associated directions must necessarily be zero the matrix @xmath139 defined above must have a two - fold eigenvalue zero .    to compare this to the behaviour of @xmath140 we first of all observe that @xmath141 maps deviations of the variables associated to @xmath142 only to deviations associated to the same @xmath31 .",
    "written in terms of @xmath143 the stability matrix multiplies deviations @xmath144 with @xmath145 where @xmath146 . here",
    "the diagonal elements indicate that the conserved quantities @xmath71 stay fixed and changes of @xmath74 are translated into equal changes in the end . in the right upper element",
    "@xmath147 indicates the increase of @xmath148 along the orbit , e.g. the period for @xmath149 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath150 takes into account that a change of the energy typically changes the period of the orbit , and similarly a change of the particle number typically changes the difference of the initial and final @xmath78 . as a consequence of ( [ mk ] )",
    ", @xmath151 has determinant zero .    to deal with these zeroes one can consider a perturbation of the hamiltonian @xcite that replaces one of the zero eigenvalues of the hessian by a small value @xmath19 . in the corresponding @xmath152",
    "a factor @xmath153 then enters in the lower left corner , turning the determinant into @xmath154 . a brief account of these perturbative results for the present case",
    "is given in [ apppert ] .",
    "the determinant of the hessian matrix @xmath155 omitting the directions associated to conserved quantities can now be evaluated by considering perturbations for both @xmath156 and @xmath149 and dividing out the two factors @xmath19 , leading to @xmath157    here @xmath117 is defined in analogy to ( [ mj ] ) and ( [ m ] ) but only w.r.t .",
    "the variables @xmath137 omitting @xmath142 .",
    "@xmath117 maps initial deviations of @xmath158 to the corresponding final values .",
    "this meaning is precisely equivalent to the stability matrix appearing in the conventional trace formula .",
    "our result for @xmath159 allows to evaluate ( in a stationary phase approximation ) the integral over all momenta and coordinates apart from @xmath160 , as well as the fluctuations of @xmath160 as @xmath58 is varied .",
    "we still have to evaluate the integral over @xmath92 @xmath161 where the @xmath162 from ( [ rtilde ] ) equals @xmath163 .",
    "due to @xmath164 the stationary phase condition gives @xmath165 as expected .",
    "now due to ( [ changeddyn ] ) a change of @xmath92 is equivalent to changing the range @xmath166 by an opposite amount .",
    "this implies that @xmath167 .",
    "the @xmath168 thus obtained cancels with the one from ( [ deth ] ) .    altogether the trace of the time evolution operator , restricted to a given value of the particle number , is thus approximated by the following sum over solutions @xmath3 of the nonlinear schrdinger equation that are periodic with period @xmath169 in our reduced phase space @xmath170 here various factors from the integration measure , eq . ( [ sphase ] ) , eq . ( [ kronecker ] ) , and the @xmath78 integral have cancelled mutually .",
    "the result is in line with @xcite .",
    "the maslov index @xmath11 counts the negative eigenvalues of the part of the hessian matrix @xmath155 associated to @xmath171 ( when brought to symmetric form involving derivatives w.r.t .",
    "@xmath172 ) .",
    "the index @xmath173 takes a similar role for @xmath149 ; it is equal to 1 if @xmath174 and 0 otherwise .",
    "an analogous phase associated to @xmath156 has already been cancelled by the stationary - phase approximation of ( [ phiint ] ) . for notational convenience",
    "we also use the maslov index to absorb the solari - kochetov phase @xcite @xmath175 we note that like the stability matrix also the action can be taken within our reduced phase space .",
    "the only difference between the two is the @xmath156 contribution to the first term in ( [ r1 ] ) , which is given by @xmath176 however for integer @xmath0 this term has no influence on the phase factor @xmath95 .",
    "moreover , as the hamiltonian is independent of @xmath98 , the change in the dynamics of @xmath98 mentioned above does not affect any of the quantities entering the trace formula .",
    "finally the laplace transform of ( [ trprop ] ) @xmath177can be performed in a further stationary - phase approximation analogous to @xcite ( and in fact similar to the @xmath92 integral above ) .",
    "the phase in @xmath178 becomes stationary if @xmath179 .",
    "however as shown e.g. in @xcite @xmath180 is precisely the energy of the solution with period @xmath50 .",
    "hence the result of the stationary phase approximation will be a sum over all solutions that are periodic in the sense above and have fixed energy @xmath4 rather than fixed period . for these solutions @xmath181 then cancels with the second term in the action ( [ r1 ] ) , hence the associated phase will be determined only by the first term @xmath182 also referred to as the reduced action . given that @xmath183 the factor @xmath184 arising from the stationary - phase approximation combines nicely with the one from ( [ trprop ] ) .",
    "altogether we thus obtain the anticipated trace formula @xmath185the summand @xmath186 gives the smooth part of the level density and arises from the lower limit 0 of the time integral .",
    "it is proportional to the volume of the energy shell in our reduced phase space and given by the pertinent variant of the weyl or thomas - fermi formula @xmath187 this result ( which is more meaningful if one avoids the canonical transformation in the beginning of subsection [ conserved ] ) is readily obtained using that for small times no time slicing is necessary .",
    "the action ( [ rdisc ] ) then boils down to @xmath188 and the result follows directly after laplace transformation . for the semiclassical approach to spectral statistics",
    "it will not be necessary to evaluate the  often involved ",
    "integral for @xmath186 . as in first quantisation",
    "@xcite subleading corrections to this result are to be expected .",
    "if the hamiltonian is written in weyl instead of normal ordering one obtains an analogous result however without a solari - kochetov phase .",
    "this is in line with @xcite as well as results for the propagator in @xcite .",
    "a derivation along the lines followed here will be given in [ appweyl ] ; it uses the analogue of the discretised action stated in @xcite and the corresponding hessian is again evaluated with the help of @xcite .",
    "an alternative derivation of the trace formula can be based on the semiclassical approximation @xcite of matrix elements @xmath189 in a basis of coherent states .",
    "interestingly , in this case @xmath49 and @xmath190 first have to be treated as independent functions subject to the conditions @xmath191 , @xmath192 only .",
    "the two functions become complex conjugate after evaluating the trace in a stationary - phase approximation , and the resulting trace formula coincides with the one obtained above .",
    "we are now equipped to study spectral statistics . inserting the trace formula into the definition of the two - point correlation function one obtains , as for single - particle systems , the double sum @xmath193/\\hbar}\\right\\rangle.\\ ] ] the correlation function",
    "is thus expressed in terms of periodic solutions of the nonlinear schrdinger equation in a way that allows to keep track of crucial interference effects .",
    "the double sum can be evaluated in the same way as for chaotic single - particle systems .",
    "we now want to discuss this evaluation in more detail . in doing",
    "so we will emphasise the ingredients entering the calculation and check the conditions under which the reasoning for single - particle systems carries through to many - particle systems in second quantisation . for the details of the calculation for single - particle systems based on these ingredients we refer to the original literature quoted below as well as @xcite .",
    "the phase space of predominantly chaotic many - particle systems typically still has small stability islands .",
    "hence it is important to stress that our theory describes the behaviour of states supported by the chaotic part of phase space .",
    "the spectral statistics is dominated by this contribution if the regular parts of phase space are small in comparison , as in the case of the bose - hubbard model in the regimes considered .    in the chaotic part of the phase space our treatment requires a gap in the spectrum of the frobenius - perron operator .",
    "this condition implies various weaker requirements such as ergodicity and hyperbolicity .",
    "the frobenius - perron operator describes the time evolution of classical phase space densities @xcite , leading from a density @xmath194 at time 0 to the density @xmath195 at time @xmath50 .",
    "here @xmath196 gives the image of the phase space point @xmath197 under classical time evolution over time @xmath50 .",
    "the leading eigenvalue of this operator is 1 , with the associated eigenfunction corresponding to a uniform density on the energy shell .",
    "the remaining eigenvalues can be written as @xmath198 where @xmath199 with @xmath200 are the ruelle - pollicott resonances .",
    "the system is said to have a spectral gap if the remaining @xmath201 are bounded away from zero so that all modes associated to non - uniform phase space densities decay in time with at least a minimal rate . for many - particle systems",

    "when evaluating ( [ dsum ] ) it is important to look for pairs of solutions whose ( reduced ) actions @xmath204 are similar as this means that their contributions can interference constructively . in contrast , terms in ( [ dsum ] ) arising from pairs of orbits with large action differences oscillate rapidly as the energy is varied and are washed out by the energy average .",
    "the simplest pairs of solutions with similar actions involve two solutions that are identical ( apart from the slight difference due to the offset in their energy arguments ) .",
    "if we neglect the difference of the corresponding factors @xmath205 and taylor expand the exponent using that @xmath206 gives the period @xmath207 , the contribution from identical solutions can be written as the single sum @xmath208 under the condition of a spectral gap such sums over periodic orbits can be evaluated using a sum rule derived in the quantum chaos context by hannay and ozorio de almeida @xcite .",
    "in the notation used here it can be written as @xmath209 where the dots represent an arbitrary property of the solutions that depends only on their period @xmath210 .",
    "this rule is a general statistical property of periodic solutions in systems with a spectral gap ; it is very helpful to extract information from these solutions even in situations where it is difficult to determine the solutions individually .",
    "( [ sumrule ] ) implies that even very long orbits give important collective contributions : while the factors @xmath211 associated to these orbits decrease with increasing period their number increases , and both effects approximately compensate . using ( [ sumrule ] ) the sum in ( [ diagstart ] )",
    "can be evaluated to give @xmath212 this result , originally derived in @xcite , is known as the diagonal approximation .",
    "it gives the first nontrivial term in an expansion of the two - point correlation function in @xmath213 , after the leading term 1 present in ( [ dsum ] ) .",
    "for time - reversal invariant systems we also have to keep track of mutually time reversed solutions , leading to a doubling of this result .",
    "contributions of higher order in @xmath214 arise from pairs of orbits differing noticeably only in so - called encounters @xcite . inside these encounters",
    "two or more parts of the same orbit come close up to time reversal , and a partner orbit can then obtained by connecting the ends of these orbit parts differently and a subsequent adjustment to obtain a valid periodic orbit satisfying the equations of motion . for time - reversal invariant systems",
    "one also has to include the case where parts of an orbit are almost mutually time reversed .",
    "two simplified sketches of such pairs of orbits are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pairs ] .",
    "the existence of such pairs of orbits requires hyperbolicity which follows from the existence of a spectral gap . in a hyperbolic system the possible directions at each point in phase space ( apart from the direction of the flow and the direction of increasing energy ) are spanned by pairs of stable and unstable directions .",
    "deviations between ( parts of ) trajectories along the stable directions decrease exponentially in time , whereas deviations along stable directions increase exponentially but decrease for large negative times .",
    "this allows to ` change connections ' inside an encounter , by constructing a part of an orbit @xmath215 that moves away from one part of @xmath3 and towards a different part of @xmath3 ; its deviation from the first part has to be unstable whereas the deviation from the second part is stable .",
    "when deriving the contribution of such pairs of orbits for single - particle systems , the deviations between encountering parts of an orbit were measured in a system of coordinates associated to the stable and unstable directions @xcite .",
    "this carries over in the present scenario as well .",
    "for example , if two parts come close we consider the points where these two parts pierce through a poincar surface of section in our reduced phase space . by transformation from the difference between the @xmath216 , @xmath74 ( @xmath217 ) we then obtain @xmath218 pairs of coordinates @xmath219 characterising the deviations between the two orbit parts in the stable and unstable directions .",
    "if the parts are almost time - reversed instead of close in phase space we instead have to consider the deviation of one part from the time - reversed of the other",
    ".    we can now determine the difference between the ( reduced ) actions of the partner orbits .",
    "apart from the difference associated to the energy offset already seen in the diagonal approximation this has a further contribution accounting for the change of action due to the changed connections in the encounters . for an encounter of two parts",
    "the latter contribution can be written as @xcite @xmath220 where the sum runs over pairs of associated stable and unstable coordinates .",
    "generalisations to encounters involving more orbit parts are given in @xcite .",
    "as in the phase of ( [ dsum ] ) the action difference is divided by @xmath43 , systematic contributions of constructively interfering orbits will have action differences of this scale and hence very close encounters .    as a further ingredient one needs to determine the probability that encounters with given separations between the stretches arise in a periodic orbit / solution .",
    "for the corresponding formula we refer to @xcite .",
    "we stress that the only requirement for its validity is the existence of spectral gap .",
    "this is used to derive an ` ergodic ' probability for different parts of an orbit to come close , as well as an estimate for the duration of an encounter , both of which enter the formula .    with all ingredients for the single - particle treatment remaining valid , the contributions of all ` diagrams ' of orbits differing in encounters ( such as those displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : pairs ] ) remain unchanged .",
    "these contributions involve powers of @xmath214 with the power increasing for more complex diagrams .",
    "the sum over all diagrams can be performed using the combinatorial techniques discussed in @xcite . for systems without time - reversal invariance the contributions cancel leaving only the diagonal approximation . for time - reversal invariant systems one obtains a series expansion to all orders in @xmath214 . in either case",
    "the results agree with the non - oscillatory terms with coefficients @xmath221 in the random matrix prediction @xmath222 here systems without time - reversal invariance ( as described by the gaussian unitary ensemble ) have @xmath223 and @xmath224 and all other coefficients vanish . for time - reversal invariant systems",
    "( as described by the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ) we have @xmath225 , @xmath226 for @xmath227 , @xmath228 and @xmath229 for @xmath230 .",
    "we note that the treatment summarised here assumes that our system ( in the reduced phase space ) has no further symmetries as these would lead to additional pairs of orbits with similar or identical actions , such as mutually reflected orbits in a system with reflection symmetry .",
    "the oscillatory terms and systems with discrete geometric symmetries will be discussed later .    as in case of normal ordering the trace formula",
    "is modified to include the solari - kochetov ( sk ) phase , we have to check that this does not affect the results arising in the present approach . to do so",
    ", we note that the contributions to the double sum only involve _ differences _ between phases associated to closeby partner orbits . due to @xmath231 the sk phase itself",
    "is of an order independent of @xmath43 .",
    "as the sk phase is time - reversal invariant the phases of two partner orbits can only differ due to the slight changes inside encounters .",
    "however for the encounters relevant for spectral statistics the encounters become very close in the semiclassical limit , meaning that the difference between the sk phases becomes negligible .",
    "the random - matrix prediction ( [ rmt ] ) for @xmath232 also involves oscillatory contributions proportional to @xmath233 . to access these contributions a more careful semiclassical approximation",
    "is needed @xcite . in this approximation",
    "the level density is accessed from spectral determinants via @xmath234 an approximation for the spectral determinant on the level of the trace formula is @xmath235 here the sum is taken over sets of orbits @xmath236 with @xmath237 elements and cumulative reduced action @xmath238 ; the amplitude @xmath239 depends on the stability and the maslov indices of the contributing orbits and @xmath240 is the smooth approximation for the number of energy levels below @xmath4 . however using the spectral determinant",
    "allows to incorporate further quantum mechanical information , in particular the fact that due to @xmath241 being hermitian @xmath242 has to be real for real arguments @xmath4 .",
    "as shown in @xcite this leads to an approximation for the spectral determinant where the contributions from sets of orbits with cumulative periods larger than half of the heisenberg tine @xmath243 are replaced by the complex conjugate of the contributions from sets with cumulative periods below this threshold .",
    "this ` riemann - siegel lookalike formula ' readily generalises to the many - body systems under consideration as its key ingredient , the semiclassical approximation for the trace of the resolvent @xmath244 , can be accessed from the trace of the propagator as above ; essentially one only has to omit the restriction to the imaginary part in ( [ getd ] ) .",
    "again periodicity is required only in the reduced phase space .    using the improved approximation of the level density as well as the same general ideas as outlined above it is possible to resolve oscillatory contributions as well . as each level density brings in two determinants , evaluating the two - point correlation function then requires to study interference between quadruplets of ( possibly empty ) sets of orbits .",
    "hence one also needs to take into account contributions where , say , after changing connections inside encounters an orbit is broken into two orbits with similar cumulative action .",
    "a treatment of these more involved correlations shows that for chaotic quantum systems @xmath232 fully agrees with the predictions from rmt  @xcite .      interestingly , there are chaotic systems that do not have a spectral gap but still satisfy some of the ingredients of our calculation , such as hyperbolicity which is required for the existence of orbit pairs differing in encounters . for these systems many of the techniques sketched here are applicable , but",
    "the final result of wigner - dyson statistics does not carry over as e.g. the sum rule ( [ sumrule ] ) becomes invalid .",
    "an interesting question for future work is whether chaotic many - body systems without a spectral gap could be faithful to rmt ensembles that incorporate more information about the problem at hand and reduce to wigner - dyson statistics in important regimes , e.g. the embedded many - body ensembles @xcite or ensembles sensitive to the spacial structure of the problem .",
    "an example for a situation where the spacial structure is important is the continuum limit with diverging number of sites ; additional orbit correlations relevant in this case were identified in @xcite .",
    "in a system with additional discrete symmetries one needs to consider the spectral statistics inside subspectra determined by the symmetry group .",
    "a prime example is the discrete ( disorder - free ) bose - hubbard model with periodic boundary conditions as introduced above .",
    "its symmetry group is the dihedral group , consisting of the discrete translation @xmath245 and its iterates ; the reflection @xmath246 ; and combinations of translations and reflection that can be viewed here as reflection about a different centre .",
    "the spectrum of the bose - hubbard model decomposes into subspectra labelled by the eigenvalues @xmath247 of the discrete translation operator where @xmath248 denotes the quasi - momentum .",
    "the spectra with @xmath249 and ( if integer ) @xmath250 decompose further into components even and odd under reflection , whereas the remaining subspectra come in energy - degenerate pairs @xmath251 , @xmath252 related by reflection .",
    "altogether we obtain @xmath253 subspectra for odd @xmath20 and @xmath254 subspectra for even @xmath20 .",
    "a representation - theoretic justification of this decomposition will be given below and we refer to @xcite for ways to implement the decomposition numerically .    the level density associated to each subspectrum is obtained using a trace formula where the classical orbits , or in the present context the solutions of the gross - pitaevski equation , are required to be periodic ( in the sense above ) inside a fundamental domain of the system @xcite .",
    "( see also @xcite . ) for the case at hand this domain can be defined e.g. by converting @xmath255 to @xmath29 for a fixed choice of @xmath256 and then imposing certain conditions on @xmath29 . demanding that @xmath257 is smallest for @xmath156 guarantees that applying the translation operator to a point inside the fundamental domain leads to a point outside .",
    "the same applies to most other elements of the symmetry group but in order to guarantee that reflection about the 0-th site leads outside the fundamental domain we need an additional requirement such as @xmath258 .",
    "each subspectrum @xmath259 ( not distinguishing between degenerate subspectra ) can now be associated to an irreducible representation of the symmetry group , and the corresponding trace formula @xcite has a form similar to ( [ trace ] ) , @xmath260 the only difference from ( [ trace ] ) apart from the restriction to the fundamental domain is the additional factor @xmath261 .",
    "here @xmath262 is the group element relating the initial and final point of the orbit @xmath3 if the orbit is considered in the full phase space as opposed to the fundamental domain .",
    "the character @xmath263 is the trace of the matrix representing @xmath262 in the representation @xmath259 . as in @xcite the derivation of ( [ symmtrace ] ) requires that a projection operator on the part of the hilbert space associated to our subspectrum is inserted inside the trace taken over the hilbert space ; doing this in our many - particle calculations starting from ( [ getd ] ) leads to exactly the same modifications as observed in @xcite for single - particle systems .    to apply ( [ symmtrace ] ) to the bose - hubbard model we need the irreducible representations of the dihedral group @xcite .",
    "the representation of the translation operator must have an @xmath20-fold power @xmath13 ; its two - dimensional representations are therefore be given by @xmath264 the reflection operator is then represented by @xmath265 and the representations of all other group elements can be found using that the matrix representation of a product of symmetry operations must be the product of the matrix representations .",
    "the general theory of symmetries in quantum mechanics ( see e.g. @xcite ) implies that the energy eigenstates associated to this representation can be grouped into pairs ( representable as vectors ) with identical energy .",
    "one can show that for the two - dimensional representation at hand this leads precisely to the energy - degenerate subspectra associated to eigenvalues of the translation operator @xmath247 ( @xmath266 ) as mentioned above .    however if we have @xmath249 or , assuming even @xmath20 , @xmath267 the matrix ( [ rep1 ] ) becomes diagonal and the two - dimensional representations defined above become reducible . instead of using these representations the associated subspectra therefore have to be described by one - dimensional representations .",
    "these represent the translation operator either by 1 or in case of even @xmath20 alternatively by -1 , whereas the reflection operator can be represented by either @xmath268 or @xmath269 regardless of @xmath20 .",
    "again these spectra precisely correspond to what we said above about the cases @xmath270 .",
    "in general the consideration of discrete symmetries can change the appropriate rmt ensemble compared to the one expected based on the time - reversal properties alone @xcite .",
    "however using eq .",
    "( [ symmtrace ] ) one can show that this does not happen for subspectra associated to representations by real matrices @xcite .",
    "as the aforementioned representations of the dihedral group are real the spectral statistics of all its subspectra is thus in line with the goe as observed numerically in @xcite as well as in the next section .",
    "to support our results numerically and complement the previous numerical studies we have performed a numerical analysis of the chaotic properties of both the quantum and the classical bose - hubbard model .",
    "our results support wigner - dyson statistics as well as mostly classical chaotic dynamics in the regime where the hopping and interaction terms are comparable .    for the quantum model we are interested in the spectral statistics as discussed above .",
    "we use a statistical observable slightly more convenient for computations than @xmath232 , namely the normalised distribution @xmath271 of ratios between subsequent level spacings ; if the ordered quantum levels are denoted by @xmath272 , these ratios are given by @xmath273 .",

    "<S> we derive a trace formula that expresses the level density of chaotic many - body systems as a smooth term plus a sum over contributions associated to solutions of the nonlinear schrdinger ( or gross - pitaevski ) equation . </S>",
    "<S> our formula applies to bosonic systems with discretised positions , such as the bose - hubbard model , in the semiclassical limit as well as in the limit where the number of particles is taken to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> we use the trace formula to investigate the spectral statistics of these systems , by studying interference between solutions of the nonlinear schrdinger equation . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in the limits taken the statistics of fully chaotic many - particle systems becomes universal and agrees with predictions from the wigner - dyson ensembles of random matrix theory . </S>",
    "<S> the conditions for wigner - dyson statistics involve a gap in the spectrum of the frobenius - perron operator , leaving the possibility of different statistics for systems with weaker chaotic properties . </S>"
