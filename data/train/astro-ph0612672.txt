    "amendola & quercellini ( 2003 ) performed a preliminary study on the limits on de  dm interactions , arising from wmap data , for de theories with constant coupling ( ccde ) .",
    "it is also possible to consider cosmologies where the dm  de coupling constant @xmath23 , that we shall define below in accordance with amendola ( 2000 ) , is replaced by @xmath24 and is therefore variable in time ( vcde ) .",
    "a physical origin for these models was recently discussed by mainini & bonometto ( 2003 ; see also colombo et al .",

    ", we describe the fitting procedure . in the case of that model",
    "we re  obtain their results .",
    "the number of parameters to be fitted depends on the nature of the model . @xmath0cdm and vcde models have the same number of parameters . in dde models",
    "there is one extra parameter and ccde models have a further parameter in respect to the previous cathegory . in evaluating the success of a fit ,",

    "( [ eq : m4 ] ) admits the tracker solution @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "this tracker solution fairly defines the initial conditions also in the presence of coupling , although , in the presence of coupling , the equation of motion becomes @xmath37 while cdm energy density varies according to the equation @xmath38 baryon and radiation equations keep the usual shape .",
    "the coefficient @xmath23 sets the coupling strength and , in the case of constant coupling ( ccde ) , we can set @xmath39 so to parametrize the coupling strength through the adimensional coefficient @xmath40 .",
    "here we consider also a @xmath12dependent coupling ( vcde ) @xmath41 for which there is no extra parameter to fix the coupling strength .",

    "here we use our optimized extension of cmbfast @xcite , able to inspect also ccde and vcde cosmologies . the likelihood of each model is then evaluated through the publicly available code by the wmap team @xcite and accompanying data @xcite .    a mcmc algorithm samples a known distribution @xmath47 by means of an arbitrary trial distribution @xmath48 .",

    "the chain is started from a random position @xmath50 and moves to a new position @xmath51 , according to the trial distribution .",
    "the probability of accepting the new point is given by @xmath52 ; if the new point is accepted , it is added to the chain and used as the starting position for a new step .",
    "if @xmath51 is rejected , a replica of @xmath50 is added to the chain and a new @xmath51 is tested .    in the limit of infinitely long chains ,",
    "the distribution of points sampled by a mcmc describes the underlying statistical process .",
    "real chains , however , are finite and convergence criteria are critical . moreover , a chain must be required to fully explore the high probability region in the parameter space .",
    "statistical properties estimated using a chain which has yet to achieve good convergence or mixing may be misleading .",
    "several methods exist to diagnose mixing and convergence , involving either single long chains or multiple chains starting from well separated points in the parameter space , as the one used here .",
    "once a chain passes convergence tests , it is an accurate representation of the underlying distribution .    in order to ensure mixing , we run six chains of @xmath53 points each , for each model category .",
    "we diagnose convergence by requiring that , for each parameter , the variances both of the single chains and of the whole set of chains ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively ) satisfy the gelman & rubin test  @xcite , @xmath56 with : @xmath57w + ( 1 + 1/m)b \\over w}~.\\ ] ] here each chain has @xmath58 points , but only the last @xmath59 points are used to estimate variances , and @xmath60 is the total number of chains . in most model categories considered ,",
    "we find that the slowest parameter to converge is @xmath61 .",
    "the basic results of this work are shown in the tables [ tab : res1][tab : res3 ] . for each model category",
    "we provide the expectation values and the variance of each parameter , as well as the values of the parameters of the best fitting models .",
    "the corresponding marginalized distributions are plotted in figures  [ fig : pdf1d1][fig : pdf1d3 ] , while joint 2d confidence regions are shown in figures  [ fig : pdf2d1][fig : pdf2d3 ] .",
    "the values of @xmath62 can also be compared , taking into account the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "this is shown in table  [ tab : chi2 ] .",
    "the smallest @xmath62 is obtained for the uncoupled sugra model , which performs slightly better than @xmath0cdm .",
    "tables 1 and 2 and the corresponding figures , _ concerning uncoupled or constant  coupling _ sugra models , show that wmap data scarcely constrain @xmath63 , allowed to vary from @xmath64 to 16 . on the contrary , in the case of a @xmath65 coupling ,",
    "loose but precise limitations on @xmath61 are set , as is shown in table 3 . in the presence of this coupling , the 2@xmath66 @xmath0interval ranges from @xmath67 to @xmath68gev .",

    ", the analysis in the presence of priors leads to analogous conclusions .",
    "there are however variations in the estimate of cosmological parameters .",
    "first , the opacity @xmath18 is pushed to values exceeding the @xmath0cdm estimates ( see also corasaniti at al .",
    "this can be understood in two complementary ways : ( i ) isw effect is stronger for dde than for @xmath0cdm , as the field @xmath12 evolves during the expansion ; hence , de effects extend to a greater redshift , increasing @xmath42 values in the low@xmath79 plateau ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to compensate this effect the fit tends to shift @xmath16 greater values . owing to the @xmath18@xmath86 degeneracy ,",
    "this is then balanced by increasing @xmath18 .",
    "( ii ) it must also be reminded that the expected te correlation for dde , at low @xmath79 , is smaller ( colombo et al .",
    "then , when te correlation data is included , a given correlation level is fit by a greater @xmath18 . in any case",
    ", however , @xmath87 keeps consistent with data within less than 2@xmath66 s .",
    "greater @xmath18 s affect also @xmath88 estimates , whose best  fit value is then greater , although consistent with @xmath0cdm within 1@xmath66 . adding a prior on @xmath89 ( bbns estimates @xcite ) lowers @xmath15 , slightly below hst findings , but still well within 1@xmath66 .",
    "we therefore consider the effect of adding a prior also on @xmath15 .",
    "the effects of these priors are shown in figures  [ fig : pdf1d1 ] and  [ fig : pdf1d2 ] .",
    "the new distributions are given by the dashed red line ( prior on @xmath88 ) and the dot  dashed blue line ( prior on @xmath15 ) .",
    "the former prior affects mainly @xmath18 and @xmath16 ; @xmath18 and @xmath16 are lowered to match wmap s findings , the high tail of @xmath18 distribution is partly suppressed .",
    "the physical analysis of primeval objects causing reionization ( ciardi et al . 2003 , ricotti et al . 2004 ) . which are still allowed but certainly not _",
    "required_.      the latter prior favors greater @xmath15 values . in the absence of coupling",
    ", this favors low@xmath61 models , closer to @xmath0cdm .",
    "in fact , the sound horizon at decoupling is not affected by the energy scale @xmath0 , while the comoving distance to last scattering band is smaller for greater @xmath61 s .",
    "then , for greater @xmath61 s lower @xmath15 values are favored , so to meet the first peak . in the presence of coupling , there is a simultaneous effect on @xmath40 : greater @xmath40 s yield a smaller sound horizon at recombination , so that the distribution on @xmath15 is smoother .",
    "a previous analysis of wmap limits on constant coupling models had been carried on by amendola & quercellini ( 2003 ) .",
    "their analysis concerned potentials @xmath28 fulfilling the relation @xmath90 , with suitable @xmath55 and @xmath59 .",
    "furthermore , they assume that @xmath91",
    ". our analysis deals with a different potential and allows more general parameter variations .",
    "the constraints on @xmath40 we find are less severe .",
    "it must be however outlined that @xmath920.2 seem however forbidden by a non  linear analysis of structure formation ( macci et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the main peculiarity of @xmath65models is that , although the @xmath93 value is not much worsened in respect to other cases , parameters are more strongly constrained in this caseq .",
    "this is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf2d3 ] . in particular , at variance from the former case , the energy scale @xmath0 is significantly constrained .",
    "several other parameters are constrained , similarly to coupled or uncoupled sugra models . what is peculiar of @xmath65models is the range of @xmath15 values which turn out to be favored .",
    "fit 2@xmath66 interval does not extend much below 0.85@xmath25 .",
    "this is a problem for these models in their present form .",
    "should new data support a greater @xmath15 value , vcde models would however be favored .",
    "quite in general , however , we must remind that vcde models were considered here only in association with a sugra potential ; vcde models with different potentials can possibly agree with a smaller @xmath15 .",
    "a particular but significant case , among vcde models , are dual axion models ( dam ; for a detailed analysis see mainini & bonometto 2004 , colombo et al 2004 ) .",
    "these models arise from a generalization of the pq solution of the strong@xmath94 problem ( peccei & quinn 1977 ) , obtained by replacing the ng potential acting on a complex scalar field @xmath95 with a quintessence potential admitting a tracker solution . while , in the usual pq approach and its generalization , only the phase @xmath96 of the @xmath95 field is physically sgnificant , in the dam also its modulus @xmath12 is physically observable . in both cases ,",
    "quanta of the @xmath96 field are axions and , if dm is made of axions , its density parameter @xmath97 is set either by the @xmath98 parameter , in the ng potential , or by the energy scale @xmath0 , in the quintessence potential . in the latter case , therefore , both dm and de features follow from fixing the single parameter @xmath0 .",
    "a detailed analysis of dam shows that it belongs to the set of vcde cosmologies ; its main peculiarity is that @xmath61 and @xmath97 are no longer independent degrees of freedom .",
    "henceforth , this model is strongly constrained and depends on the same number of parameters as scdm . by varying @xmath97 in its physical range ,",
    "@xmath61 keeps however close to 10 .",
    "this great value of @xmath61 therefore causes a conflict with the observed @xmath15 range .",
    "all previous comments on vcde models however hold , while it is also possible that extra contribution to dm , arising from topological singularities expected in axion theories , can ease the @xmath15 problem .",
    "the first evidences of dm are fairly old ; they date some 70 years ago .",
    "however , only in the late seventies limits on cmb anisotropies showed that non ",
    "baryonic dm had to be dominant .",
    "de can also be dated back to einstein s _ cosmological constant _ , although only sn ia data revived it , soon followed by data on cmb and deep galaxy samples .",
    "the main topic of this paper is the fit of wmap data with various de models : @xmath0cdm , sugra dynamical and constant coupling de models , as well as variable coupling de models . in the last model dm and de",
    "are coupled in a non  parametric way , with @xmath99 .",
    "the fits of wmap data to these models yield similar @xmath62 s . at variance from other model categories , however , in vcde models , cmb data constrain @xmath0 .",
    "this is due to the stronger effects of @xmath12 variations on the detailed isw effect , as they affect both de pressure and energy density , as well as de  dm coupling . in principle",
    ", this strong impact of @xmath12 variation could badly disrupt the fit and make vcde models significantly farther from data .",
    "it is noticeable that this does not occur .",
    "the success of vcde models would be complete if the favored range of values of the hubble parameter ( @xmath1001 ) could be slightly lowered .",
    "this range is however obtained just for a sugra potential .",
    "furthermore , primeval fluctuations were assumed to be strictly adiabatic while , in axion models , a contribution from isocurvature modes can be expected .",
    "this could legitimately affect the apparent position of the first peak in the anisotropy spectrum , so completing the success of the model , in a fully self  consistent way .",

    "<S> we find that the best fitting model is sugra dynamical de , almost indipendently from the exponent @xmath1 in the self  interaction potential .    </S>",
    "<S> the main target of this work are however coupled de models , for which we find limits on the de  dm coupling strength . in the case of variable coupling </S>",
    "<S> , we also find that greater values of the hubble constant are preferred . </S>"
