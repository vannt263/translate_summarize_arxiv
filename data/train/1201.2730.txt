    "infrared ( ir ) spectroscopy has been a powerful tool to study the microscopic carrier dynamics and electronic structures in strongly correlated electron materials , such as rare earth ( @xmath1 electron ) , transition metal ( @xmath2 electron ) , and organic ( @xmath3 electron ) compounds @xcite .",
    "the ir spectroscopy technique has been also performed under high pressure using a diamond anvil cell ( dac ) [ 2 - 13 ] since the strongly correlated materials show many interesting physical properties under high pressure . in a dac ,",
    "a pair of diamond anvils and a thin metal gasket are used to seal a sample and a pressure transmitting medium @xcite .",
    "a typical diameter of the diamond surface is 0.8  mm to reach a pressure of 10  gpa , and 0.6  mm to reach 20  gpa .",
    "therefore the sample in this experiment should have dimensions of the order of 100  @xmath4 m . to perform an infrared ( ir ) reflectance study on such a small sample under the restricted sample space in a dac",
    ", synchrotron radiation ( sr ) has been used as a bright source of both far and mid - infrared .",
    "in fact , high pressure ir spectroscopy with dac is currently one of the major applications of ir - sr [ 4 - 7,9 - 13 ] .    with a dac",
    ", the reflectance is measured between the sample / diamond interface , in contrast to the usual case of sample / vacuum or sample / air interface .",
    "the normal - incidence reflectance of a sample relative to a transparent medium of ( real ) refractive index @xmath5 is given by the fresnel s formula as @xcite : @xmath6 here , @xmath7 is the complex refractive index of the sample , and @xmath5=2.4 for diamond and 1.0 for vacuum .",
    "hereafter , we denote @xmath8 at sample / diamond interface as @xmath0 , and that at sample / vacuum interface as @xmath9 . from eq .",
    "( 1 ) , it is easily seen that @xmath0 of a sample measured in dac may be substantially different from @xmath9 .",
    "the purpose of this study is to consider the kramers - kronig ( kk ) analysis of @xmath0 data measured in dac .",
    "kk analysis has been widely used to derive optical constants such as the refractive index , dielectric function and optical conductivity from a measured @xmath9 spectrum @xcite . however , due to the difference between @xmath9 and @xmath0 discussed above , the usual kk analysis method can not be straightforwardly applied to @xmath0 @xcite . to derive optical constants from @xmath0 , therefore ,",
    "previous high pressure ir studies used either a drude - lorentz spectral fitting @xcite or a modified kk transform @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we propose a different method , which relies on the usual kk transform with an appropriate cutoff to the @xmath0 , as an alternative approach to obtain the infrared @xmath10 from @xmath0 .",
    "the validity of the proposed method is demonstrated with actually measured reflectance data of prru@xmath11p@xmath12 .",
    "the complex reflectivity of the electric field , @xmath13 , is expressed as @xcite @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the square root of the reflectance @xmath8 , which is actually measured in experiments .",
    "then the real and imaginary parts of @xmath16 can be expressed in terms of @xmath17 and @xmath18 as @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "therefore , if @xmath21 can be derived from measured @xmath15 with kk analysis even for the sample / diamond reflection case , @xmath22 and @xmath23 can also be derived simply by setting @xmath5=2.4 in eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "then , the imaginary part of the complex dielectric function is given as @xmath24 , and the optical conductivity is given as @xmath25 @xcite .    in performing kk analysis on reflectance data , usually the logarithm of @xmath13 , namely @xmath26",
    "is regarded as a complex response function . in the case of sample / vacuum reflection",
    ", the kk relation between @xmath27 and @xmath21 is expressed as @xcite @xmath28 here , @xmath29 denotes the principal value . in deriving this relation",
    ", it is required that @xmath30 has no poles in the upper complex @xmath31 plane when @xmath32 is finite .",
    "this is correct since @xmath33 only when @xmath34 in the case of @xmath5=1 .",
    "however , when @xmath35 as in the case of sample / diamond interface , @xmath36 may be satisfied at some point on the upper imaginary axis @xcite . this point is denoted as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a real , positive and finite number . when @xmath36 , @xmath39 from eq .",
    "( 2 ) and @xmath40 therefore has a pole at @xmath37 .",
    "accordingly , the kk relation in this case must be modified to @xcite @xmath41.\\ ] ] namely , the presence of a medium with @xmath35 brings an extra phase shift , indicated by the square bracket in eq .",
    "( 7 ) , into the kk relation .",
    "note that the extra phase shift is a decreasing function of @xmath42 , and that the original kk relation of eq .",
    "( 6 ) is recovered when @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "detailed theoretical considerations on the extra phase shift in various situations have been reported @xcite . in the case of actual experimental studies , however , the precise value of @xmath38 may not be known .",
    "accordingly , the value of @xmath38 has been estimated from experimental @xmath0 data by use of a combination of dl fitting and the modified kk transform @xcite . in this method",
    ", one uses eq .",
    "( 7 ) with @xmath44 and looks for a value of @xmath38 that well reproduces the @xmath10 given by a dl fitting of @xmath0 .",
    "note that , on the other hand , if the frequency range of interest is lower than the value of @xmath38 , effects of the extra phase may be only minor , and the usual kk transform of eq .",
    "( 6 ) , combined with the use of @xmath5=2.4 in eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , might give sufficiently accurate values of optical constants .",
    "we will examine the validity of such a procedure in the next section .",
    "here , we use @xmath9 spectra actually measured on prru@xmath11p@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this compound is well known for showing a metal - to - insulator transition at about 60  k @xcite , and a clear energy gap in @xmath10 was observed in our previous work @xcite .",
    "here we use @xmath9 at 60  k ( metal ) and 9  k ( insulator ) measured over a wide photon energy range of 0.008 - 30  ev @xcite , which are shown by the blue curve in figs .",
    "1(a ) and 2(a ) .     is the reflectance spectrum of prru@xmath11p@xmath12 measured at 60  k in vacuum @xcite , and @xmath0 is that expected in a dac calculated from @xmath9 as described in the text .",
    "the green , red , and light blue curves are @xmath45 extrapolations with cutoff energies of @xmath46=1.5 , 2 , and 5  ev , respectively .",
    "( b ) the optical conductivity ( @xmath47 ) obtained with kk analysis of @xmath9 is compared with those obtained with kk analysis of @xmath0 with a cutoff at @xmath46=1.5 , 2 , and 5  ev , and @xmath45 extrapolations above them . below 1.5  ev , @xmath10 obtained from @xmath0 with @xmath46=2  ev agrees very well with that obtained from @xmath9 . ]",
    "the procedure is the following .    *",
    "the full @xmath9 spectrum is kk analyzed with eq .",
    "( 6 ) to obtain @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath10 . *",
    "the above @xmath22 and @xmath23 are substituted into eq .",
    "( 1 ) with @xmath5=2.4 to derive @xmath0 that is _ expected _ in a dac . * the @xmath0 obtained above",
    "is used with the usual kk transform of eq .",
    "( 6 ) and @xmath5=2.4 in eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , to obtain @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath10 .",
    "before this is done , an appropriate cutoff and extrapolation are made to the @xmath0 , as described in detail below .",
    "if the kk analysis on @xmath0 works properly , the resulting @xmath10 from ( iii ) should well agree with that given by @xmath9 and the usual kk analysis .",
    "we first examine the 60  k data .",
    "the expected @xmath0 at 60  k obtained by ( i ) and ( ii ) is indicated by the black curve in fig .",
    "1(a ) . in carrying out the integration in eq .",
    "( 6 ) , the @xmath9 spectrum were extrapolated below 0.008  ev and above 30  ev with the hagen - rubens and @xmath45 functions , respectively .",
    "it is seen in fig .",
    "1(a ) that @xmath0 shows very high values above about 4  ev .",
    "this physically unrealistic feature resulted from the unphysical assumption of constant @xmath5=2.4 in the entire spectral range . in reality , of course , the refractive index of diamond can not be constant and real near and above the band gap , where it shows strong light absorption .",
    "in addition , when @xmath34 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and therefore @xmath50 must hold just like any other material . accordingly , before performing kk transform in ( iii ) , @xmath0 in fig .",
    "1(a ) was cut off at some energy @xmath46 , and then it was extrapolated with @xmath45 function .",
    "several different values of @xmath46 were tried , as shown in fig .",
    "for each value of @xmath46 , the usual kk transform of eq .",
    "( 6 ) was made to get @xmath21 , which was then used to derive @xmath22 and @xmath23 with @xmath5=2.4 in eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , and to finally obtain @xmath10 .",
    "figure  1(b ) shows the @xmath10 spectra obtained as described above , with different values of @xmath46 which are also indicated in fig .",
    "it is seen that the obtained @xmath10 spectra strongly depend on @xmath46 . with @xmath46=2.0",
    "ev , the resulting @xmath10 below 1.5  ev agrees very well with that derived from the original @xmath9 .",
    "( actually , @xmath46=2.2  ev gives the best agreement , but @xmath46=2.0  ev data is shown instead .",
    "this is because the 2.2  ev data almost completely overlaps with that from @xmath9 , making it difficult to distinguish them in the figure . )",
    "the result for the 9  k data , where the sample is an insulator ( semiconductor ) , is also shown in fig .  2 .",
    "a good agreement is again observed between the @xmath10 derived from the full @xmath9 and that from @xmath0 with @xmath46=2  ev .",
    "the spectral range of their good agreement is below 1.5  ev , which is similar to the case of 60  k data discussed above .",
    "note also that both 9  k and 60  k data show good agreement with the common value of @xmath46= 2  ev .",
    "these results show that , for any spectral change in @xmath0 ( either temperature- or pressure - induced ) below 1.5  ev , the corresponding @xmath10 can be obtained by the present method .",
    "in actual high pressure studies of strongly correlated materials with dac [ 2 - 13 ] , @xmath0 is usually measured below 1 - 2  ev .",
    "hence , above the high energy limit of @xmath0 measurement , the @xmath0 expected from @xmath9 can be connected to the measured @xmath0 , with the cutoff and extrapolation discussed above .",
    "then the connected @xmath0 may be kk transformed to obtain @xmath10 , as discussed above . an obvious condition required for this method to work properly is that the pressure- and temperature - induced changes of @xmath0 should be limited below certain energy , which is 1.5  ev for prru@xmath11p@xmath12 as seen in figs .",
    "1(b ) and 2(b ) .",
    "this condition is actually met in the high pressure data of prru@xmath11p@xmath12 , which has enabled us to derive its @xmath10 under pressure up to 14  gpa using the present method @xcite .",
    "is the reflectance spectrum of prru@xmath11p@xmath12 measured at 9  k in vacuum @xcite , and @xmath0 is that expected in a dac calculated from @xmath9 as described in the text .",
    "the green , red , and light blue curves are @xmath45 extrapolations with cutoff energies of @xmath46=1.5 , 2 , and 5  ev , respectively .",
    "( b ) the optical conductivity ( @xmath47 ) obtained with kk analysis of @xmath9 is compared with those obtained with kk analysis of @xmath0 with a cutoff at @xmath46=1.5 , 2 , and 5  ev , and @xmath45 extrapolations above them . ]",
    "we have also done similar simulations for other compounds , both metals and insulators , using actually measured data , and have obtained similar results .",
    "namely , when an appropriate cutoff and extrapolation are applied to @xmath0 , the usual kk transform of eq .",
    "( 6 ) gave @xmath10 spectra which agreed very well with those directly obtained from the wide range @xmath9 .",
    "a limitation of the present method is , as already mentioned above , it can give correct @xmath10 only below certain photon energy ( 1.5  ev in the case of prru@xmath11p@xmath12 ) .",
    "hence this method is useful when the temperature and pressure dependences of @xmath0 is limited to below certain energy .",
    "in addition , to use the present method , it is required that @xmath9 is known over a wide enough photon energy range , since @xmath22 and @xmath23 must be obtained from @xmath9 with the usual kk analysis .",
    "while a mathematically rigorous justification of the proposed method is beyond the scope of this work , this method may be very useful as a simple analysis technique of reflectance spectra measured under high pressure with dac .",
    "this work has been done as a part of high pressure infrared studies of strongly correlated electron materials using synchrotron radiation at spring-8 , under the approval by jasri ( 2009a0089 through 2011b0089 ) .",
    "the @xmath9 data used in figs .",
