    "the apparent ubiquity of supermassive blackholes ( smbhs ) in the spheroidal components of present - day galaxies , and the correlation between the mass of smbhs and spheroidal stellar components @xcite indicate that the active galactic nucleus ( agn ; smbh - driven activity ) and the starburst (= active star - formation ; plausibly the progenitors of spheroids ) are physically connected and have co - evolved .",
    "observational constraints on how and when smbhs grow in mass , in relation to starbursts , is vital for fully understanding the galaxy formation process in the universe .",
    "the widely accepted cold dark matter - based galaxy formation scenarios postulate that mergers of gas - rich galaxies with smbhs at their centers are common throughout the history of the universe @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of such gas - rich galaxy mergers not only suggest that many stars form rapidly in dust / gas - obscured regions , but also suggest that smbhs have high mass accretion rates and become luminous agns , deeply buried in the nuclear dust / gas , making such gas - rich galaxy mergers luminous in the infrared @xcite .",
    "it is essential to evaluate the importance of _ buried _ agns in dust / gas - rich infrared luminous galaxy mergers , by separating them from the surrounding starbursts , if we are to observationally understand the physical processes that occur during this key epoch in the co - evolution of stars and smbhs @xcite .",
    "however , unlike optically selected agns , where a central mass - accreting smbh is surrounded by toroidally shaped dust / gas ( the so - called dusty molecular torus ) and the agn s radiation can photo - ionize gas clouds along the torus axis above a torus scale height @xcite , deeply buried agns are optically elusive and their detection requires observations at wavelengths of low dust extinction .",
    "a buried agn ( mass accretion onto a smbh ) has two different properties from a starburst ( nuclear fusion inside stars ) .",
    "first , the efficiency of the agn s radiative energy generation ( 642% of mc@xmath4 , where m is the mass of the accreting material and c is the speed of light ) @xcite is much higher than that of nuclear fusion inside stars ( @xmath50.7% of mc@xmath4 ) , so that an agn has very high surface brightness emission , and can heat a large amount of surrounding dust to high temperatures ( several 100k ) , producing a strong mid - infrared 320 @xmath3 m continuum emission .",
    "second , the x - ray to uv luminosity ratio is much higher in an agn than a starburst @xcite .",
    "these differences between an agn and a starburst could create different effects / feedback to the surrounding material .",
    "if we discover agn - sensitive ( sub)millimeter molecular lines , we can disentangle the agn from the starburst using the flux ratios of these lines , in a manner similar to the optical agn - starburst spectroscopic classification method , based on the optical emission line flux ratios , which is extensively applied to less dusty galaxies @xcite .",
    "once established , this ( sub)millimeter molecular line energy diagnostic method will create a large potential to scrutinize deeply buried agns in dust / gas - rich galaxies out to the distant universe , because of ( a ) negligible dust extinction in the ( sub)millimeter wavelength range , and ( b ) the availability of highly sensitive alma observing facility .",
    "based on pre - alma ( sub)millimeter interferometric 15  resolution observations of the nuclear regions of nearby bright starburst and seyfert galaxies (= modest luminosity agns ) , the enhanced emission of the dense gas tracer , hcn , at j=10 ( rotational transition ) , relative to hco@xmath1 , has been found in agns and been proposed as a possible agn indicator @xcite .",
    "this was mainly thanks to the spatially - resolved investigation of agn - affected molecular gas , by reducing the contamination from spatially - extended star - formation - affected molecular gas emission in seyfert host galaxies , because the contamination could hamper the detection of the signatures of agn - affected molecular gas emission in large - aperture single - dish telescope observations @xcite .",
    "subsequent interferometric observations have also confirmed enhanced hcn j=10 emission in the nuclei of dust / gas - rich merging luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ; l@xmath6 @xmath7 10@xmath8l@xmath9 ) , which are diagnosed to be buried - agn - important based on infrared spectroscopy , compared to starburst - dominated lirgs @xcite .",
    "based on recent single - dish telescope s observations , a similar trend of hcn j=10 flux excess , relative to hco@xmath1 j=10 , has been confirmed for infrared - classified agn - important lirgs , compared to starburst - dominated lirgs @xcite .",
    "alma cycle 01 interferometric observations further support hcn emission enhancement , relative to hco@xmath1 , in the nuclei of agn - important lirgs , compared to starburst regions at j=43 @xcite .",
    "it has now become clear that luminous agns tend to show enhanced hcn emission .",
    "however , the physical interpretation of enhanced hcn emission in agns is still unclear .",
    "although hcn abundance enhancement in an agn is proposed in some chemical calculations , because of high dust temperature and/or x - ray irradiation @xcite , it is also calculated that the hcn - to - hco@xmath1 abundance ratio in molecular gas around an agn can vary dramatically , depending on assumed physical parameters @xcite .",
    "additionally , even if hcn abundance is indeed enhanced in an agn , the widely assumed collisional excitation alone seems not to be enough to reproduce the strong hcn rotational j - transition emission lines observed in some agns @xcite .",
    "an infrared radiative pumping mechanism has been proposed to be a plausible scenario for the enhancement of hcn rotational j - transition emission in agns @xcite .",
    "specifically , hcn can be vibrationally excited to v@xmath2=1 by absorbing infrared 14 @xmath3 m photons @xcite . through the decay back to the vibrational - ground level ( v=0 ) , the hcn rotational j - transition flux at v=0 can be stronger than collisional excitation alone @xcite . since an agn can emit infrared 14 @xmath3 m continuum emission much more strongly than a starburst , due to agn - heated hot ( several 100 k ) dust , such an infrared radiative pumping mechanism for hcn should work more effectively in an agn than in a starburst .",
    "in fact , the hcn v@xmath2=10 _ absorption _ features were seen at infrared 14 @xmath3 m in several obscured agns @xcite , and the vibrationally excited hcn v@xmath2=1 , l=1f ( hereafter v@xmath2=1f ) j=43 and/or j=32 _ emission _ lines in the ( sub)millimeter wavelength have recently been detected in several agn - hosting lirgs @xcite , supporting the scenario that infrared radiative pumping actually works in some agns to vibrationally excite hcn and could contribute to an increase in hcn j - transition flux at v=0 .",
    "however , the other dense gas tracers , hco@xmath1 and hnc , also have absorption features at infrared @xmath512 @xmath3 m and @xmath521.5 @xmath3 m , respectively @xcite , and could therefore be vibrationally excited to v@xmath2=1 by infrared radiative pumping",
    ". if the infrared radiative pumping mechanism is responsible for the enhanced hcn j - transition emission at v=0 in agns , its efficiency must be particularly high for hcn only .",
    "a comparison of the strengths of the v@xmath2=1 emission lines for hcn , hco@xmath1 , and hnc is the most straightforward way to test the scenario of whether infrared radiative pumping works most efficiently for hcn and selectively boosts hcn j - transition flux at v=0 .",
    "no meaningful observational constraints are placed in external galaxies for the strengths of hco@xmath1 and hnc v@xmath2=1f j - transition lines , except for the report concerning the detection of hnc v@xmath2=1f j=32 emission line in the agn - hosting lirg , ngc 4418 @xcite .",
    "we conducted alma cycle 2 observations of the luminous infrared galaxy , iras 20551@xmath04250 ( z=0.043 ) , to investigate the relative strength of vibrationally excited ( v@xmath2=1 ) hcn , hco@xmath1 , and hnc j - transition lines .",
    "iras 20551@xmath04250 is categorized as an ultraluminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) with infrared ( 81000 @xmath3 m ) luminosity l@xmath6 = 10@xmath10l@xmath9 , and has far - infrared ( 40500 @xmath3 m ) luminosity l@xmath11 = 10@xmath12l@xmath9 ( see table 1 of imanishi & nakanishi 2013b ) .",
    "it consists of main single nucleus with the signature of a long merging tail in the southern direction @xcite .",
    "it is classified optically as a liner / hii - region ; namely , it has no obvious optical agn ( seyfert ) signature @xcite .",
    "based on several energy diagnostic methods using infrared and x - ray spectroscopy , the signature of a luminous , energetically significant ( 2060% of the bolometric luminosity ) buried agn was identified in iras 20551@xmath04250 , in addition to starburst activity @xcite .",
    "the vibrationally excited hcn v@xmath2=1f j=43 emission line was tentatively detected with our alma cycle 0 data because of small molecular line widths , which enable us to clearly separate the hcn v@xmath2=1f j=43 emission line from the nearby , much brighter , hco@xmath1 v=0 j=43 emission line @xcite .",
    "thus , iras 20551@xmath04250 is a very good target for investigating the relative strength of vibrationally excited hcn / hco@xmath1/hnc j - transition emission lines , and how the infrared radiative pumping mechanism affects the rotational excitation of hcn / hco@xmath1/hnc at v=0 .    in the present paper",
    ", we report the results of alma cycle 2 observations of the agn - hosting ulirg , iras 20551@xmath04250 , at hcn , hco@xmath1 , and hnc lines at both the vibrational - ground ( v=0 ) and vibrationally excited ( v@xmath2=1 ) levels . throughout this paper",

    "molecular parameters are derived from the cologne database of molecular spectroscopy ( cdms ) @xcite via splatalogue ( http://www.splatalogue.net ) . for molecular transitions , where there is no indication of v ( the vibrational - level ) , we mean v=0 ( i.e. , the vibrational - ground level ) .",

    "our alma cycle 2 observations in band 6 ( 211275 ghz ) were undertaken within the program 2013.1.00033.s ( pi = m. imanishi ) .",
    "the details of our observations are given in table 1 .",
    "we adopted the widest 1.875 ghz band mode and 3840 total channel number for our observations .",
    "we requested @xmath210@xmath226 spatial resolution in our proposal .",
    "we employed three spectral windows in usb in band 6 to cover ( a ) hcn j=32 ( rest - frame frequency is @xmath23 = 265.89 ghz ) , ( b ) hco@xmath1 j=32 ( @xmath23 = 267.56 ghz ) and hcn v@xmath2=1f j=32 ( @xmath23 = 267.20 ghz ) , and ( c ) hco@xmath1 v@xmath2=1f j=32 ( @xmath23 = 268.69 ghz ) in each of the three spectral windows .",
    "hcn and hco@xmath1 j=32 emission lines can therefore be obtained at both the vibrational - ground ( v=0 ) and vibrationally excited ( v@xmath2=1f ) levels concurrently .",
    "we also conducted additional independent observations for hnc j=32 ( @xmath23 = 271.98 ghz ) and hnc v@xmath2=1f j=32 ( @xmath23 = 273.87 ghz ) .",
    "we employed four spectral windows , of which two in usb were used to cover hnc j=32 and hnc v@xmath2=1f j=32 lines .",
    "the remaining two spectral windows in lsb were used to probe continuum emission and serendipitously detected emission lines .",
    "we used casa @xcite for our data analysis .",
    "we first checked the visibility plots in calibrated data provided by the joint alma observatory and found that the presence of hcn , hco@xmath1 , and hnc j=32 emission lines was clearly recognizable .",
    "signatures of other weak emission lines were also seen in some spectral windows .",
    "we selected channels that were not clearly affected by detected emission line features , and estimated the continuum flux levels , by using data in ( a ) three spectral windows for hcn / hco@xmath1 observations and ( b ) four spectral windows for hnc observations .",

    "the absolute calibration uncertainty is estimated to be @xmath2110% in band 6 , which will not significantly affect our main discussion .",

    "these independently taken continuum data show consistent results , in terms of peak position , peak flux , and morphology . to understand the physical origin of the detected continuum emission , we assume that half of the far - infrared ( 40500 @xmath3 m ) luminosity of iras 20551@xmath04250 comes from starburst activity , because ( a ) the agn bolometric contribution in iras 20551@xmath04250 is estimated to be 2060% @xcite and ( b ) the bolometric luminosity of iras 20551@xmath04250 is dominated by far - infrared ( 40500 @xmath3 m ) emission ( l@xmath11 = 10@xmath12l@xmath9 ) ( @xmath251 ) .",
    "the contribution from thermal free - free emission in starburst hii - regions at @xmath5255 ghz is estimated to be @xmath51.6 mjy , using equation ( 1 ) of @xcite .",
    "this is a significant contribution to the observed continuum flux at @xmath5255 ghz with 3.63.8 mjy .",
    "if the starburst contribution to the observed far - infrared luminosity is higher than 50% , the free - free emission flux at @xmath5255 ghz will be even higher .",
    "therefore , we infer that the detected continuum emission ( @xmath53.63.8 mjy ) at @xmath5255 ghz is a combination of thermal free - free emission from starburst hii - regions and dust emission heated by dust - obscured energy sources ( agn and/or starburst ) . since the detected continuum emission is spatially compact with @xmath21250 pc ( fig .",

    "we need to correct for these silicate dust absorption features , if we are to obtain the intrinsic mid - infrared spectral energy distribution which is produced in the close vicinity of the obscured energy sources and is illuminated to their nearby molecular gas .",

    "the emission can be produced in the region where infrared 14 @xmath3 m photons are available and since galactic sources emit some amount of infrared 14 @xmath3 m photons , the detection in nearby galactic sources is reasonable , as long as observations are sensitive enough to detect low luminosity emission .",
    "however , iras 20551@xmath04250 at z=0.043 ( luminosity distance is 188 mpc ) is much further away from our galaxy and the detected v@xmath2=1f emission line luminosity in iras 20551@xmath04250 ( table 4 ) is more than several orders of magnitude higher than the galactic sources . since an agn is a much stronger mid - infrared continuum emitter than a starburst under the same bolometric luminosity , due to the larger amount of hot dust in the former ( @xmath251 ) , an agn can produce strong v@xmath2=1f emission more easily than stars .",
    "@xcite estimated that @xmath590% of the observed 58 @xmath3 m flux of iras 20551@xmath04250 comes from agn - heated hot dust emission .",

    "it is widely accepted that a starburst shows strong pah emission features , while a pure agn does not @xcite , because pahs are destroyed in the close vicinity of an agn @xcite .",
    "the derived rest - frame equivalent widths of the 6.2 @xmath3 m , 7.7 @xmath3 m , and 11.3 @xmath3 m pah emission features are @xmath545 [ nm ] , @xmath5190 [ nm ] , and @xmath5185 [ nm ] , respectively .",

    "@xcite also modeled that the observed 1025 @xmath3 m emission of iras 20551@xmath04250 is dominated by an agn - origin dust continuum emission component .",
    "thus , we regard that the observed mid - infrared continuum from iras 20551@xmath04250 is dominated by the agn - heated hot dust emission .",
    "since the agn - heated hot dust emission is spatially very compact and is more centrally - concentrated than surrounding dust @xcite , a simple foreground screen dust model is applicable .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt power - law - shaped intrinsic continua , using data unaffected by the silicate dust absorption features and strong pah emission features .",
    "the derived intrinsic power law continua , after correcting for the silicate dust absorption features using the foreground screen dust model , are shown in figure 7 .",
    "the ratio of the infrared flux used for the infrared radiative pumping among hcn ( 14 @xmath3 m ) , hco@xmath1 ( 12 @xmath3 m ) , and hnc ( 21.5 @xmath3 m ) is @xmath54 where we compare the power - law continuum fluxes at the redshifted wavelengths with @xmath55 0.043 .",
    "the infrared spectral energy distribution of the hidden energy source of iras 20551@xmath04250 ( in f@xmath49 ) shows higher fluxes with increasing wavelength at 535 @xmath3 m . strictly speaking ,",
    "the continuum emission , outside the strong silicate dust absorption features , could be flux - attenuated by foreground dust absorption , and its shape could change slightly .",
    "however , as we will show below , this change is insignificant .",
    "the optical depth of the 9.7 @xmath3 m silicate dust absorption feature , relative to the adopted power law continuum level in figure 7 , is estimated to be @xmath56 @xmath5 2.7 .",
    "this corresponds to a@xmath57 = 2550 mag , if the relation of @xmath56/a@xmath57 = 0.0540.11 , found in the galactic interstellar medium @xcite , is adopted .",
    "the dust extinction at 520 @xmath3 m , outside the strong silicate dust absorption features ( a@xmath58 ) , is a@xmath58 = 0.027 @xmath24 a@xmath57 @xcite , or a@xmath58 = 0.71.4 mag in the case of iras 20551@xmath04250 .",
    "since the dust extinction curve at 520 @xmath3 m is relatively flat @xcite , the possible change in the intrinsic continuum spectral shape at 520 @xmath3 m outside the silicate dust absorption features , through dust extinction , is too small to significantly affect our discussion .",
    "thus , we adopt the ratio of equation ( 8) .",
    "adopting the above values , the ratio of the infrared radiative pumping rate among hcn , hco@xmath1 , and hnc is    @xmath59    namely , the infrared radiative pumping rate of hnc is much higher than hcn and hco@xmath1 , mainly due to the longer wavelength of the infrared v@xmath2=1 absorption line .",
    "the einstein a coefficient for the rotational j=32 transition at v@xmath2=1f ( a@xmath60 ) , relative to that for the vibrational transition from v@xmath2=1 to v=0 ( a@xmath61 ) , is @xmath54 @xmath24 10@xmath62 , @xmath54 @xmath24 10@xmath62 , and @xmath52 @xmath24 10@xmath62 for hcn , hco@xmath1 , and hnc , respectively ( table 5 and @xmath254.3,1 , third paragraph ) .",
    "thus , most of the vibrationally excited molecules to v@xmath2=1 quickly decay back to v=0 , rather than decaying to a lower rotational - j level at v@xmath2=1 . however , the a@xmath60 to a@xmath61 ratios agree within a factor of @xmath52 among hcn , hco@xmath1 , and hnc .",
    "once vibrationally excited to j=3 at v@xmath2=1f , a similar fixed fraction of rotational j - transition from j=3 to j=2 at v@xmath2=1f is expected , which should be detectable as the v@xmath2=1f j=32 emission line .",
    "thus , the detection of the hnc v@xmath2=1f j=32 emission line in a galaxy with detectable hcn v@xmath2=1f j=32 and j=43 emission lines is quite reasonable , under our current assumption that hcn and hnc have comparable column density at v=0 . on the other hand ,",
    "the radiative pumping rates of hcn and hco@xmath1 are comparable .",
    "the detection of the hcn v@xmath2=1f j=32 emission line , without the detection of the hco@xmath1 v@xmath2=1f j=32 emission line , requires some consideration .    when the v@xmath2=1 to v=0 column density ratio ( n@xmath63/n@xmath45 ) , controlled by the infrared radiative pumping , is @xmath641 ( see @xmath254.5 ) , we obtain the relation @xmath65 here , transitions among rotational j - levels within v=0 and v@xmath2=1 are neglected . from this equation ,",

    "the observed hcn - to - hco@xmath1 and hcn - to - hnc flux ratios are almost identical to those at j=32 .",
    "since excitation condition does not significantly change the flux ratios between j=32 and j=43 in iras 20551@xmath04250 ( @xmath254.1 ) and since the abundance effect should be the same between j=32 and j=43 , the observed flux ratios at j=43 can be naturally interpreted with the similar intrinsic flux ratios and flux attenuation to j=32 .",
    "we thus apply the same flux attenuation correction for j=43 as employed above for j=32 .",
    "the intrinsic molecular line flux ratio of iras 20551@xmath04250 at j=32 and j=43 , after the correction for flux attenuation by line opacity , are plotted as open symbols in figure 6 , which are further deviating from the distribution of starburst - dominated regions .",
    "other data points could also move if opacity - corrected intrinsic flux ratios are used .",
    "if hcn flux enhancement is indeed a good signature of agns , and if this is due in part to hcn abundance enhancement , then the line opacity of hcn emission and thereby the opacity correction factor of hcn flux , relative to hco@xmath1 and hnc , could be higher in agns than in starburst galaxies .",
    "this will move agns to the right and upper direction , even deviating from the distribution of starburst galaxies .",
    "this could make the hcn - flux - based separation between agns and starbursts more solid .",
    "furthermore , if higher hcn opacity is the case in agns , while some agns show enhanced observed hcn fluxes , other agns may not .",
    "this could explain the result that some fraction of agns do not necessarily show observed hcn flux enhancements @xcite , although it is possible that the result is partly due to the dilution of the signatures of agn - affected molecular gas emission , by the large contamination from spatially - extended starburst - affected molecular gas emission in their large - aperture single - dish telescope data .",
    "correction for flux attenuation through isotopologue observations ( e.g. , h@xmath27cn , h@xmath27co@xmath1 , hn@xmath27c , hc@xmath29n , h@xmath29nc ) is necessary not only for iras 20551@xmath04250 , but also for other galaxies , to derive intrinsic flux ratios in figure 6 .",
    "finally , in figure 6 , iras 22491@xmath01808 shows no clear infrared - identified buried agn signatures , and yet shows a high hcn - to - hco@xmath1 flux ratio at j=43 @xcite . for iras 22491@xmath01808 , the hcn v@xmath2=1f j=32 emission line has been detected in our alma cycle 2 data @xcite , suggesting the presence of a strongly 14 @xmath3 m emitting energy source , which is naturally explained by a luminous buried agn , due to agn - heated hot dust ( @xmath251 and @xmath254.3.1 ) .",
    "iras 22491@xmath01808 may contain an extremely deeply buried agn whose signatures are not detectable in infrared energy diagnostic methods , but can be detected in ( sub)millimeter observations for the first time , due to reduced effects of dust extinction .",
    "the presence of similar sources , infrared - classified - starbursts with elevated hcn - to - hco@xmath1 flux ratios , is found also at j=10 @xcite .",
    "alma ( sub)millimeter observations of these sources are interesting to scrutinize the presence of infrared - elusive , but ( sub)millimeter - detectable , extremely deeply buried agns .",
    "we here comment a few caveats for our discussion above .",
    "first , transitions among rotational j - levels within v=0 and v@xmath2=1 are not treated in our calculations ( eqns .",
    "( 10)(12 ) ) , because the number of currently available molecular j - transition data is not large enough to do this in a reliable manner .",
    "this could be the largest uncertainty .",
    "however , the similar excitation up to j=4 at v=0 among hcn , hco@xmath1 , and hnc , estimated from their similar observed j=43 to j=32 flux ratios ( @xmath254.1 ) , suggests that the effects of this uncertainty for our discussion at j=3 and j=4 are expected to be relatively limited , unless excitation at higher - j is considerably different among hcn , hco@xmath1 , and hnc .",
    "when more j - transition data become available , this point will be tested more .",
    "second , we assumed that hcn , hco@xmath1 , and hnc emission both at v=0 and v@xmath2=1 come from the same region ( @xmath254.3.1 ) .",
    "this is clearly too simplistic .",
    "even though the dipole moments are comparable among hcn , hco@xmath1 , and hnc ( @xmath254.3.1 ) , their critical densities are not perfectly the same .",
    "hco@xmath1 has a lower critical density than hcn and hnc by a factor of @xmath55 for the same j - transition at v=0 @xcite , so that the spatial extent of collisionally - excited hco@xmath1 v=0 j=32 emission line can be larger than those of hcn / hnc v=0 j=32 emission lines , if molecular gas has a gradually decreasing radial density distribution from the very center to the outer region in a galaxy @xcite , due to the decrease of typical density of individual molecular gas clumps .",
    "in fact , it is sometimes seen in a galaxy nuclear scale that hco@xmath1 emission is spatially more extended than hcn emission at the same j - transition @xcite .",
    "this is also the case for iras 20551@xmath04250 , because hco@xmath1 v=0 j=32 emission is estimated to be slightly more extended spatially than hcn / hnc v=0 j=32 emission ( @xmath253 ) .",
    "the size of the continuum emitting region around a buried agn is also different at 14 @xmath3 m ( used for the vibrational excitation to v@xmath2=1 for hcn ) , 12 @xmath3 m ( hco@xmath1 ) , and 21.5 @xmath3 m ( hnc ) .",
    "these different geometries are shown as schematic diagrams in figure 9 . for the v@xmath2=1f j=32 emission , in the case of constant radial density distribution of molecular gas ,",
    "since the number of infrared photons per molecule is larger in the close vicinity of an agn than the outer part , the v@xmath2=1f to v=0 flux ratios of hcn / hco@xmath1/hnc should be higher at the inner part , and the bulk of the v@xmath2=1f j=32 emission is likely to come from the inner region in figure 9 .",
    "emission - weighted size of the v@xmath2=1f j=32 line can become smaller than that of the v=0 j=32 line for hcn / hco@xmath1/hnc .",
    "the difference of v@xmath2=1f to v=0 flux ratios between the inner and outer parts , and the emission - weighted size difference between v@xmath2=1f and v=0 , are reduced , if molecular gas has a decreasing radial density distribution from the galaxy center to the outer part .",
    "we need to consider how these differences in geometry could alter our results obtained based on the assumption that hcn / hco@xmath1/hnc v=0 and v@xmath2=1f lines come from the same volume .    regarding the size difference between v@xmath2=1f j=32 and v=0 j=32 emission ,",
    "the total fluxes of hcn / hco@xmath1/hnc v@xmath2=1f j=32 emission lines from molecular gas in figure 9 are primarily determined by the number of infrared photons which are absorbed and used for the vibrational excitation to v@xmath2=1 . as long as ( a )",
    "the covering solid angle around the central infrared continuum emitting energy source does not differ a lot among hcn , hco@xmath1 , and hnc , and ( b ) the bulk of the v@xmath2=1f j=32 emission is covered within our alma beam , then our discussion in @xmath254.3 is essentially unchanged . both of the conditions ( a ) and ( b ) are likely to be met .",
    "regarding the size difference of the infrared continuum emitting regions among hcn / hco@xmath1/hnc , the most important factor for our infrared radiative pumping calculations of v@xmath2=1f fluxes in @xmath254.3.1 is again the number of infrared photons used for the vibrational excitation to v@xmath2=1 .",
    "the slight difference of the spatial extent of continuum emitting regions at different infrared wavelengths will not alter our results significantly , as long as ( a ) the infrared continuum emitting regions are more compact than the surrounding molecular gas , and ( b ) the covering fraction around the central energy source is similar among hcn , hco@xmath1 , and hnc . both of the conditions (",
    "a ) and ( b ) are expected to be fulfilled .    regarding the size difference of v=0 j=32 emission among hcn , hco@xmath1 , and hnc ,",
    "the hco@xmath1 j=32 emission is estimated to be spatially more extended than hcn / hnc j=32 emission inside the alma beam ( @xmath253 ) . in this case , the source solid angle ( @xmath39 ) in equation ( 1 ) becomes larger for hco@xmath1 j=32 than hcn / hnc j=32 , and the hco@xmath1 j=32 ( v=0 ) column density is smaller than our estimate .",
    "this affects our discussion of column density and thereby abundance .",
    "in fact , if both hcn j=32 and hco@xmath1 j=32 emission are thermalized ( excitation temperature is comparable to the kinetic temperature of molecular gas ) ( @xmath254.1 ) and if the optical depth of hcn j=32 line is larger than that of hco@xmath1 j=32 line ( @xmath254.3.2 ) , then the hco@xmath1 j=32 flux can not be larger than the hcn j=32 flux , as long as both lines are emitted from the same volume , because their frequencies are almost identical .",
    "the hco@xmath1 v=0 j=32 to hcn v=0 j=32 flux ratio of 1.4 ( table 5 ) can be explained , if the hco@xmath1 v=0 j=32 line emitting region is @xmath71.4 times larger in @xmath39 than the hcn j=32 line emitting region within our alma beam . in our alma data , the spatial extent of hco@xmath1 v=0 j=32 emission",
    "is estimated to be larger than those of hcn / hnc v=0 j=32 emission by a factor of @xmath51.5 in @xmath39 ( @xmath253 ) . in this case , the actual hco@xmath1 column density ( abundance ) relative to hcn will decrease by @xmath550% .",
    "this will even strengthen our result that hcn - to - hco@xmath1 abundance ratio is high in the iras 20551@xmath04250 nucleus .",
    "it is also possible that due to the lower critical density of hco@xmath1 v=0 j=32 than hcn / hnc v=0 j=32 , the size of individual molecular gas clumps is larger for hco@xmath1 v=0 j=32 than hcn / hnc v=0 j=32 , if each molecular clump has a decreasing radial density distribution @xcite . in this case , hco@xmath1 v=0 j=32 emission could occupy a larger volume fraction inside a molecular cloud than hcn / hnc v=0 j=32 emission .",
    "this will also work to decrease the hco@xmath1 column density ( abundance ) relative to hcn and hnc , which again reinforces our main result of enhanced hcn - to - hco@xmath1 abundance ratio in the nucleus of iras 20551@xmath04250 .",
    "third , we assumed that the observed mid - infrared continuum is dominated by agn - heated hot dust emission ( @xmath254.3.1 ) .",
    "even though this is the case for iras 20551@xmath04250 , there may be non - negligible contribution from starburst emission to the observed mid - infrared flux .",
    "since starburst - heated dust usually has cooler temperature than agn - heated dust , the starburst contribution to the observed mid - infrared flux becomes relatively higher at a longer wavelength @xcite .",
    "the relative contribution from starbursts can be larger at 21.5 @xmath3 m ( for hnc ) than 12 @xmath3 m ( hco@xmath1 ) and 14 @xmath3 m ( hcn ) .",
    "if certain fraction of infrared 21.5 @xmath3 m flux comes from starbursts , rather than the buried agn , the agn - origin hnc term in equation ( 13 ) will decrease .",
    "even if this slightly modifies the hnc term in equation ( 13 ) , our main result of very high hcn - to - hnc abundance ratio ( @xmath254.3.1 ) will not change .    summarizing , even though neglecting the transitions among rotational j - levels within v=0 and v@xmath2=1 needs to be tested in future data , our main result is robust to possible ambiguity of the assumed geometry of hcn , hco@xmath1 , and hnc emission regions around energy sources .",
    "the excitation temperature ( t@xmath85 ) is related to the column density at level @xmath86 ( n@xmath35 ) , in the form of @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the total column density of a given molecule , @xmath89 is a partition function , @xmath90 is an energy at level @xmath86 above the ground state , k@xmath80 is the boltzmann constant , and g@xmath91 is the statistical weight .",
    "the excitation temperatures ( t@xmath85 ) in iras 20551@xmath04250 , based on the observed fluxes in this paper and @xcite , are shown in table 8 .",
    "if v@xmath2=1 emission is optically thin and v=0 emission is optically thick , the intrinsic vibrational excitation temperature ( t@xmath92 ) after correction for line opacity will be smaller than that based on the observed flux ratio between v@xmath2=1 and v=0 .",
    "for hcn , the t@xmath92 values corrected for the flux attenuation with the factor of 6 for hcn v=0 j=32 emission ( @xmath254.3.2 ) are also shown in table 8 .",
    "the same opacity correction is applied for hcn v=0 j=43 emission ( see @xmath254.3.2 ) .    in table 6",
    ", we also show the hcn v@xmath2=1f to v=0 flux ratios at j=43 and/or j=32 in ngc 4418 and mrk 231 , for which flux attenuation of v=0 emission is quantitatively estimated @xcite .",
    "the observed ratios are similar between iras 20551@xmath04250 and mrk 231 . for ngc 4418 ,",
    "the observed hcn v@xmath2=1f to v=0 flux ratios at j=32 and j=43 are higher by a factor of 45 than iras 20551@xmath04250 and mrk 231 .",

    "given the almost identical einstein a coefficient at v@xmath2=1f and v=0 for the same j transition lines ( table 5 ) , we can derive that the population ( @xmath93flux / a ) at v@xmath2=1 ( j=3,4 ) is approximately 0.51% of that at v=0 ( j=3,4 ) in iras 20551@xmath04250 , ngc 4418 , and mrk 231 .",

    "in fact , hcn abundance enhancement in the close vicinity of agns was argued in several previous works .",
    "the observed v@xmath2=1f j=32 to v=0 j=32 flux ratios for hcn / hco@xmath1/hnc and the observed hcn v=0 j=32 to h@xmath27cn v=0 j=32 flux ratio suggest that hcn v=0 j=32 emission has a significant line opacity and is flux - attenuated by a factor of 6 , whereas the flux attenuation of hco@xmath1 v=0 j=32 and hnc v=0 j=32 emission lines was estimated to be @xmath213 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "the higher flux attenuation by line opacity for hcn than hco@xmath1 and hnc is as expected from the estimated higher hcn abundance than hco@xmath1 and hnc .",
    "the observed flux ratio and excitation temperature between v@xmath2=1f and v=0 suggest that infrared radiative pumping has an effect to rotational excitation at v=0 for hcn and hnc .",
    "the hcn - to - hco@xmath1 j=32 flux ratio at v=0 is similar to the previously obtained hcn - to - hco@xmath1 j=43 flux ratio at v=0 in iras 20551@xmath04250 , and both are higher than starburst - dominated regions .",
    "the enhanced hcn - to - hco@xmath1 flux ratio in this agn - hosting ulirg was interpreted to be originated mainly in the enhanced hcn - to - hco@xmath1 abundance ratio and sufficient hcn excitation , rather than the substantially higher infrared radiative pumping efficiency of hcn than that of hco@xmath1 . when the estimated line opacity for hcn / hco@xmath1/hnc v=0 emission is corrected , the hcn - to - hco@xmath1 j=32 and hcn - to - hnc j=32 flux ratio at v=0 for iras 20551@xmath04250 will increase , even deviating from the ratios found in starburst - dominated regions .",
    "if larger hcn line opacity due to enhanced hcn abundance is common in agns , agns and starburst galaxies will be separated even more in the plot of line - opacity - corrected , intrinsic hcn - to - hco@xmath1 and hcn - to - hnc flux ratios , than in the plot of observed flux ratios .",
    "line opacity correction of other sources is also necessary to refine these molecular line flux ratios for use as an even more solid energy diagnostic method of dust / gas - rich ulirgs .",
    "various emission lines , other than the targeted hcn / hco@xmath1/hnc , were also detected , including hoc@xmath1 , so@xmath2 , so , h@xmath27cn , hc@xmath28n , and ch@xmath28cch , demonstrating the high sensitivity of alma and the abundant presence of excited molecular gas by the nuclear energy source in iras 20551@xmath04250 .    we are grateful to the anonymous referee for his / her useful comments",
