    "the separation and coalescence of droplets is a common phenomenon , which occurs in multiple situations , such as cloud formation , film formation  @xcite or inkjet printing  @xcite .",
    "while sessile droplets with a contact angle of are comparable to freely suspended droplets , sessile droplets of different contact angles are omnipresent and can have a significantly altered behaviour , as we show in this work .",
    "many different phenomena are found in this process , like jumping of the coalescing droplets  @xcite , a transition from coalescence to noncoalescence  @xcite , variations in the meniscus shape  @xcite and resulting behavior  @xcite , mixing  @xcite or the growth rate dependence of the meniscus on the contact angle  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a large interest in droplets and bubbles submerged in a liquid exists  @xcite . often experiments on droplets",
    "are performed submerged  @xcite , in order to reduce the influence of gravity , to scale diffusion  @xcite or in order to study altered friction behavior  @xcite .    of particular interest",
    "is the initial coalescence dynamics , just after the drops are brought into contact .",
    "the two drops become connected by a small liquid bridge that rapidly grows in time ( fig .",
    "[ fig : experiment ] ) .",
    "this rapid motion is due to the large curvature that induces a very large ( negative ) laplace pressure , driving the liquid into the bridge between the two drops .",
    "this process has for example been studied extensively for freely suspended drops @xcite . here",
    "we concentrate on drops on a substrate , which further complicates the geometry of the coalescence process @xcite .",
    "an important observation is that the dominant direction of the flow is oriented from the center of the drops towards the bridge , such that the relevant scaling laws can be inferred from quasi - two - dimensional arguments @xcite .",
    "interestingly , for inertia - dominated coalescence it was shown that droplets of a contact angle behave differently from those of a lower contact angle .",
    "even small deviations from lead to a faster growth of the bridge height in time , which can be described in terms of scaling laws .",
    "in particular , the inertial coalescence changes from @xmath0 for , to a @xmath1 power law for smaller angles @xcite . in both cases the shape of the liquid bridge exhibits a self - similar dynamics , but with different horizontal and vertical scales when the contact angle reaches .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the coalescence of sessile drops immersed in another liquid , as it is relevant in many applications .",
    "this has been addressed in the viscous regime @xcite , for which both the drops and the surrounding fluid were highly viscous . here",
    "we perform lattice boltzmann simulations in the inertial regime and define the outer fluid to be of the same density as the coalescing droplets .",
    "we investigate how the bridge dynamics changes as a function of the contact angle and , to the best of our knowledge , for the first time investigate whether self - similar behavior can be identified in the velocity field .",
    "a detailed comparison to experiments  @xcite of drops in air is provided , pointing out similarities and differences with respect to immersed droplets .",

    "we follow the method described by shan and chen  @xcite @xmath17 these interaction forces cause the separation of fluids and a surface - tension @xmath18 . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to two fluids and refer to them as `` red '' and `` blue '' fluids .",
    "the width of fluid interfaces and the resulting surface tension are governed by the interaction strength parameter @xmath19 , which is chosen as @xmath20 for all shown simulations .",
    "this results in a surface tension of @xmath21 .",
    "our choice of parameters implies that the viscous length scale @xmath22 is comparable to the lattice unit @xmath23 .",
    "the resulting scale for the coalescence is thus much larger than the viscous length , ensuring we are in the inertial regime of coalescence  @xcite .    in this setup",

    "the parameters are chosen as @xmath29 to minimize absolute forces .    using full slip boundaries to effectively mirror the system at the symmetry axis ,",
    "the computational domain and therefore computational cost is halved .",
    "the computational costs have to be considered for the two following reasons : as we are interested in obtaining the meniscus height over time with sufficient accuracy , we need to scale our entire system to a large resolution . a second numerical effect to consider",
    "is that , because of the finite width of the interface , the interface and the resulting fluid behavior can be overrepresented . to avoid this ,",
    "the interface thickness should be small , as compared to the droplet radius  @xcite . the droplet radius at a contact angle of is chosen to be @xmath30 , so that the interface thickness results in about of the droplet radius .",
    "it was found empirically that this drop size is sufficient to achieve reproducible results for the resulting hydrodynamics .",
    "all fluid volumes and system dimensions are kept constant and only the wall interaction parameters @xmath31 and a horizontal shift length , that brings the droplets into contact , are adjusted for all subsequent simulations of decreasing contact angles .      both in experiment and in simulations , it is challenging to initiate coalescence and to define the time @xmath32 that marks the start of the coalescence . here",
    "we provide technical details on how the simulations were performed .",
    "a first problem is that the width of the diffuse interface and the fluid pressures are dependent on the @xmath19 fluid parameters , so that it is not possible to predict beforehand the correct densities at all positions .",
    "this is why equilibration during initialization is required .",
    "a lack of correct initialization will lead to strong artefacts , such as an enclosed bubble for droplets of a contact angle that can be avoided with careful initialization . to do so , we first equilibrate a horizontally centered single droplet at the wetting wall before a second drop is introduced .    the introduction of a second drop , and the initiation of coalescence is a subtle matter by itself .",
    "here we shift the droplet to a system boundary with a full slip boundary condition .",

    "the inset displays the same data , manually shifted .",
    "it can be seen that , apart from a small startup phase , these curves coincide .",
    "the initial timestep of coalescence is therefore highly dependent on two parameters : the choice of the density defined as the interface position and the initial shift.[fig : tnot ] ]    to investigate the effect of the precise location of the second drop , we investigate the growth dynamics for different shifts , i.e.  different initial positions . as an example",

    "as expected , overlapping droplets coalesce with an initial non - zero bridge height .",
    "by contrast , small separations between the drops cause a delay of the coalescence process by multiple timesteps . in this case diffusion occurs across the small separation of droplets , so that it takes some time before a detectable bridge has formed between the two drops .",

    "the experimental data shown here was shifted upwards , by a factor of @xmath34 , for the purpose of better visualization . however , even without this shift the experimental data lies about a factor @xmath34 above the numerical data .",
    "this quantitative difference can possibly be attributed to the fact that the simulations consider droplets that are immersed into an outer fluid of equal density .",
    "the transport inside the outer fluid does slow down the dynamics with respect to the case of drops in air , which is consistent with the observations in fig .",
    "[ fig : scalingmatch ] .",
    "therefore a quantitative match of these is not to be expected , but in terms of scaling laws the simulations comply with experiments . as the wettability of the substrate alters the contact angle of the fluid , it alters the capillary pressure of the droplets . due to the capillary pressure driving the coalescence",

    "the situation is best understood for contact angles @xmath47 , for which the horizontal scale and vertical scale are simply proportional to one another : the ratio of the two lengths is set by the tangent of the contact angle .",
    "this can for example be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : timeseries ] , showing that the width of the meniscus increases as well as @xmath35 during the growth . since @xmath35 sets the characteristic scale of the bridge , the capillary pressure can be estimated as    @xmath48    similarly , the inertial pressure is obtained as    @xmath49    which then leads to the observed @xmath50    to further test the idea that the dynamics is governed by the growing length scale @xmath45 , one can attempt a collapse of the bridge profiles during the growth process .",
    "this is shown for the case @xmath51 in fig .",
    "[ fig : selfsim73 ] , where we overlay the meniscus shapes for different times , after rescaling the horizontal and vertical scales with @xmath45 .",
    "the scaled profiles indeed exhibit an excellent collapse .",
    "this confirms that the bridge growth is characterized by a universal spatial profile , and that the temporal dependence can be effectively absorbed in the growing length scale @xmath45 .",
    "the self - similarity only applies for the initial stages of coalescence , so the data shown are until the bridge height reaches about one third of the initial drop height .",
    "this limits the data to parts of the droplet deformed by the coalescence , where the scaling law is applicable .",
    "small deviations far from the meniscus can be attributed to this effect .",
    "figure  [ fig : selfsim73 ] also shows the corresponding experimental plot from  @xcite , for which self - similarity was convincingly demonstrated as well . the numerical bridge shapes ( for immersed drops )",
    "differ slightly from the experimental profiles , but the same principle of self - similarity is valid during the initial stages of coalescence .    rescaled bridge shape for droplets with a contact angle of reveal a self - similar bridge growth .",
    "closed symbols correspond to simulation results , open symbols are experimental data for water drops in air @xcite . ]     and",
    "the amplitude of the field is shown by varying the width of the streamlines linearly with the amplitude of the underlying vectors .",
    "[ fig : vel73 ] ]    interestingly , the simulations allow one to extract information that is not easily accessible through experiments , such as the fluid velocities @xmath53 and @xmath54 . inspired by the idea of self - similarity , we rescale the streamline patterns by again normalizing @xmath55 and @xmath56 by @xmath45 . the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vel73 ] , where the streamlines are obtained after scaling the velocities with @xmath57 ( different times are visualized using different colors ) .",
    "the streamline patterns exhibit an excellent collapse .",
    "it can be seen that the coalescence causes a recirculating flow , with a vortex located to the right of the symmetry axis , driving the meniscus upwards .",
    "the necessary rescaling of the velocity vectors can be understood by considering @xmath58 .",
    "this implies that @xmath59 , as was indeed used in preparing fig .",
    "[ fig : vel73 ] .",
    "let us now turn to the case of droplets with @xmath61 , for which the interfaces are tangent when brought into contact . as a consequence of this geometry , the horizontal and vertical scales are no longer the same .",
    "we therefore introduce the width of the bridge @xmath3 , indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : experiment ] , as the horizontal scale that is much smaller than @xmath35 .",
    "the geometry is such that    @xmath62    and subsequently , the scaling laws need to account for this disparity of horizontal and vertical scales .",
    "the usual argument is that the capillary pressure reads    @xmath63    which can be balanced with the inertial pressure    @xmath64    this leads to    @xmath65    and explains why the meniscus growth differs from the 2/3 law observed for smaller contact angles ( cf .",
    "[ fig : scalingmatch ] ) .",
    "once more , we will test these scaling ideas by searching for self - similar dynamics , both for the bridge shape and for the velocity profiles .",
    "the first of these tests is provided in fig .",
    "[ fig : selfsim90 ] , where the bridge profiles for @xmath61 are rescaled with @xmath66 on the horizontal axis and with @xmath35 in the vertical direction .",
    "a collapse is indeed observed , confirming the necessity of taking different horizontal and vertical scales .",
    "in addition the numerical profiles exhibit a perfect agreement with the experimental results for the bridge shape  @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , however , we have not been able to obtain a convincing self - similarity for the velocity fields for @xmath61 .",
    "following the logic above , one would expect for the horizontal velocity @xmath67 , while for the vertical velocity @xmath68 .",
    "however , the best  collapse \" was obtained by empirically scaling the velocities respectively as @xmath69 and @xmath52 , and the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vel90 ] .",
    "one again observes a recirculating flow that leads to the bridge growth , but the associated vortex structure is not perfectly self - similar .",
    "in particular , we note that the vortex appears to become smaller in time , after rescaling , suggesting that @xmath35 and @xmath3 are not the correct scales for the velocity field .",
    "the velocities of strongest amplitude lie underneath the meniscus and are nearly only vertical .",
    "mass conservation in this case is achieved by enlarging the respective area in time .",
    "this means that the usual scaling arguments of equations [ eq : pcap ] and [ eq : piner ] might actually be too simplistic .",
    "for example , the self - similar scaling of the meniscus profiles implies that the typical curvature scales as @xmath70 , and not as @xmath71 , as was assumed in ( [ eq : pcap ] ) . this would change the coalescence exponent from 1/2 to 2/5 , which does not concur with simulations and previous experiments .",
    "this observation on the velocity field suggests that the pressure scaling ( [ eq : piner ] ) needs to be revised .",
    "the flow field is more intricate than the scaling argument allows to believe .",
    "uncertainties in the definition of the scaling argument undermine this requirement .",
    "this would be an interesting topic for future work , for which a larger range of numerical data would be required to conclusively infer the relevant scaling laws .",
    "droplets with a contact angle of only differ from freely suspended coalescing droplets by a minor amount of surface friction .",
    "therefore the scaling argument for freely floating droplets might need to be revisited as well .         and @xmath52 .",
    "the amplitude of the field is shown by varying the width of the streamlines linearly with the amplitude of the underlying vectors . [",
    "fig : vel90 ] ]",
    "we simulated the coalescence of submerged droplets with different contact angles and compared our results to experimental data .",
    "similar growth rates for the bridge height in time , equally dependant on the contact angle could be found in this case . despite quantitative differences of the interface position of the fluid interface between experimental data of droplets in air and the simulation of submerged droplets ,",
    "the same rescaling argument revealed a self similarity in time .",
    "being able to use the same scaling arguments to scale the interface position of both the experimental droplets in air and the submerged simulated droplets shows the universality of the scaling argument .",
    "we applied this scaling law to the velocity field and , for droplets of a contact angle , revealed the underlying velocities that cause the coalescence and give reasons for the scaling of the amplitude of the velocities . for droplets of a contact angle we presented that the velocities causing the coalescence are more intricate than the scaling laws indicate .",
    "this shows that , though these scaling laws seem to work for the interface position , the underlying estimate for the relevant scaling for the velocity appears to be inconsistent with the internal flow structure .",
