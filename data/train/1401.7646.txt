    "in this paper , we consider the following method of introducing unary operators to intuitionistic propositional logic :    1 .",

    "another method of introducing unary operators leading to intuitionistic tense logic was investigated by j.  m.  davoren @xcite :    1 .",
    "building the fusion ik@xmath1ik of two copies of intuitionistic modal logic ik , the first one with modalities @xmath4 and the second one with @xmath5 , and adding brouwerian axioms to connect @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "these two methods are shown here to be equivalent and the result is called int2gc+fs , according to ( a ) .",
    "this name should be understood as `` intuitionistic logic with two galois connections combined using fischer servi axioms '' .",
    "note that for combinations of modal logics , we follow the notation of @xcite . if @xmath6 and @xmath7 are axiomatically presented modal logics in languages @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , then the fusion @xmath6@xmath1@xmath7 is the smallest multi - modal logic in the language @xmath8@xmath1@xmath9 containing @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and closed under all the inference rules of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8@xmath1@xmath9 denotes the smallest common extension of the languages @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath10 is a logic in language @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is a finite set of schemes in @xmath11 , then the extension @xmath13 is the smallest logic in @xmath11 extending @xmath10 , containing the schemes in @xmath12 as additional axioms , and closed under the rules of @xmath10 .    if @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 are identified with tense operators @xmath18 , @xmath19 ( future ) and @xmath20 , @xmath21 ( past ) , respectively , the system int2gc+fs is equivalent to the known system ik@xmath0 , called _ intuitionistic tense logic _ , introduced by w.  b.  ewald @xcite .",
    "the logic ik@xmath0 is generally taken as the intuitionistic counterpart of the _ classical tense logic _",
    "k@xmath0 ( see @xcite , for instance ) and we will neither discuss this fact here nor consider the philosophical issues raised by ik@xmath0 ( for instance , its constructivity ) .",
    "we would also like to emphasize that this is not a matter of providing another list of axioms for ik@xmath0 that is much shorter than the ewald s list of axioms .",
    "note that the logic k@xmath0 is often in the literature called the _ minimal tense logic_. since we consider only the minimal tense ( classical , intuitionistic , intermediate ) logics , we will omit the word `` minimal '' in the rest of the paper .",
    "methods ( a ) and ( b ) are visualized in figure  [ fig : figure1 ] .",

    "here fs stands for the fischer servi axioms , gc for galois connections , and br for the browerian axioms.,title=\"fig:\",width=377 ]    the above equivalences also hold if one changes the basic logic from intuitionistic to classical , in which case one gets classical tense logic k@xmath0 . adopting approach ( a ) from intuitionistic and classical logics to any intermediate logic l ,",
    "we present a method to obtain the corresponding logic l2gc+fs .",
    "this is done simply by adding to l two galois connections ( by means of the appropriate rules ) , or by building the fusion lgc@xmath1lgc of two copies of intermediate logic with a galois connection lgc , and then interlinking their operators by two fischer servi axioms .",
    "we prove algebraic completeness for l2gc+fs and show that it is conservative over l. we also give facts justifying why l2gc+fs can be considered as an _ intermediate l - tense logic _",
    "lk@xmath0 .",
    "there are several advantages of approach ( a ) over ( b ) .",
    "the l - tense logic lk@xmath0 ( or equivalently l2gc+fs ) can be uniformly built for every intermediate logic l , without entering the problem of what is the modal version lk of l , since the `` modal part '' is provided solely by the galois connections , and the fischer servi axioms make a duality - like connection between the operators .",
    "for a given intermediate logic l , it is often not clear what is its modal analogue lk ( between ik and k ) .",
    "for instance , it took several years to find out , what is gdel modal logic . in @xcite , strong completeness of the @xmath15-version and the @xmath14-version of gdel modal logic were proved .",
    "recent studies @xcite show that there are several gdel modal logics of two modalities which are defined by a kripke frame semantics .",
    "in particular , gdel modal logics are different for `` crisp '' frames and for `` fuzzy '' frames",
    ". moreover , approach ( a ) allows a uniform treatment of algebraic semantics .",
    "galois connections play a central role both in ( a ) and ( b )  and in the whole paper , hence we recall some well - known properties of order - preserving galois connections used here . they can be found in @xcite , for instance .",
    "let @xmath22 and @xmath23 be maps between ordered sets @xmath20 and @xmath24 .",
    "the pair @xmath25 is a",
    "_ galois connection _ between @xmath20 and @xmath24 , if for all @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 an equivalent characterisation states that a pair @xmath25 forms a galois connection between @xmath20 and @xmath24 if and only if @xmath29    it is well known that galois connections can be created by any relational frame @xmath30 by reversing the relation @xmath31 .",
    "the operators @xmath14 and @xmath15 defined for all @xmath32 by @xmath33 and @xmath34 are both part of a galois connection .",
    "the galois connections in question on the powerset lattice @xmath35 are then @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where the operators @xmath36 and @xmath37 are defined by inverting the relation @xmath31 . however , the idea of extending propositional calculus with a galois connection as modalities appears to be rather new , and mainly motivated by applications in computer science .",
    "there is a growing interest in the study of galois connections as modalities , as can be seen in the recent surveys by m.  menni and c.  smith @xcite and garca - pardo _",
    "the study of galois connections can be traced back to the initial works of o.  ore @xcite and b.  jnsson and a.  tarski @xcite .",
    "more recent studies of galois connections as modal operators in complete lattices can be found , for instance , in @xcite , where b.  von  karger developed several temporal logics from the theory of complete lattices , galois connections , and fixed points , and in @xcite , where galois connections , conjugate functions , and their fixed points are considered in complete boolean lattices .    in `` syntactical side ''",
    ", galois connections can be subsumed into a logic only either by including galois connection rules ( see page  ) or by introducing browerian axioms ( see page  ) .",
    "however , in `` semantical side '' , the situation is different in the sense that , for instance , for a complete lattice @xmath38 , a mapping @xmath39 is known to be a part of a galois connection if and only if @xmath40 is a complete join - morphism , that is , @xmath41 for all @xmath42 . in such a case , the `` other part '' @xmath43 is defined by @xmath44 .",
    "this means , for example , that in a finite lattice @xmath45 , every additive and normal map @xmath46 induces a galois connection . in relational settings , galois connections",
    "are essentially related to inverting a relation ; if a possibility - like operator is defined in terms of a relation ( or a composition of relations ) by an `` exists''-condition , then its adjoint operator is defined simply by a `` for all''-condition and the inverse the original relation ( or the inverse of the composition of relations ) .",
    "similar kind of situation can be observed for `` categorical functors '' , and a functor is known to have a left adjoint if and only if it is continuous and a certain `` smallness condition '' is satisfied .",
    "note that every partially ordered set can be viewed as a category in a natural way : there is a unique morphism from @xmath47 to @xmath48 if and only if @xmath49 .",
    "thus , an order - preserving galois connection is a pair of adjoint functors between two categories that arise from partially ordered sets .    in the literature",
    "can be found several papers that consider modalities as adjoint pairs .",
    "topos - theoretic approaches to modality are presented by g.  e.  reyes and h.  zolfaghari in @xcite , with adjoint pair @xmath50 , and s4-like axioms satisfied by @xmath15 and @xmath14 separately . in @xcite ,",
    "g.  e.  reyes and m.  w.  zawadowski developed this theory further in the context of locales , giving axiomatisation , completeness and decidability of modal logics arising in this context .",
    "more recently , m.  sadrzadeh and r.  dyckhoff studied in @xcite positive logic whose nonmodal part has conjunction and disjunction as connectives , and whose modalities come in adjoint pairs .    in categorical models ,",
    "propositions are interpreted as the objects of a category and proofs as morphisms .",
    "for instance , p.  n.  benton considers in @xcite so - called lnl - models , which are categorical models for intuitionistic linear logic as defined by girard .",
    "benton studies also rules for lnl which are similar to our galois connection rules . in @xcite , g.m .",
    "bierman and v.  de  paiva consider an intuitionistic variant is4 of the modal logic s4 and its models in the framework of category theory .",
    "_ study in @xcite two systems of constructive modal logic which are computationally motivated .",
    "these logics are `` constructive s4 '' and `` propositional lax logic '' .",
    "they prove duality results which show how to relate kripke models to algebraic models , and these in turn to the appropriate categorical models .",
    "our work is based on algebraic and kripke semantics , and since we consider minimal intermediate tense logics , we do not assume additional modal axioms .",
    "hence , we do not follow the categorical proposal of modelling constructive s4-modalities that uses the additional axioms t and 4 .",
    "the difference between systems applying constructive s4-modalities and ours is similar to the difference between classical tense logic and classical s4 .",
    "this paper continues our study of galois connections in intuitionistic logic . in @xcite",
    ", we introduced intuitionistic propositional logic with a galois connection @xmath2 , called intgc .",
    "we showed that @xmath51 and @xmath52 are _ modal operators _ in the sense that @xmath51 distributes over @xmath53 ( that is , is _ additive _ ) and preserves @xmath54 ( that is , is _ normal _ ) and @xmath52 distributes over @xmath55 ( i.e. , is _ multiplicative _ ) and preserves @xmath56 ( i.e. , is _ co - normal _ ) .",
    "we gave both algebraic and relational semantics , and showed that intgc is complete with respect to both of these semantics .",
    "we noted that intgc is conservative over intuitionistic logic and that glivenko s theorem does not hold between propositional logic with a galois connection @xcite and intgc .",
    "in addition , in @xcite we proved that intgc has the finite model property , which enabled us to state that a formula of intgc is provable if and only if it is valid in any finite distributive lattice with an additive and normal operator , or equivalently , the formula is valid in any finite distributive lattice with a multiplicative and co - normal operator . with respect to relational semantics ,",
    "this is equivalent to the validity in any finite relational models for intgc .",
    "we also presented how intgc is motivated by generalised fuzzy sets . in @xcite , we gave representations of expansions of bounded distributive lattices equipped with a galois connection .",
    "we studied in @xcite two galois connections in intuitionistic logic and then with fischer servi axioms added , their algebraic and relational semantics .",
    "we announced there some results that are presented here . in a similar way ,",
    "in this work we extend intgc with a galois connection @xmath57 by adding another galois connection pair @xmath58 . just adding another galois connection does not change much ,",
    "we have intgc `` doubled '' , called here int2gc .",
    "note that int2gc is the same as the fusion intgc@xmath1intgc .",
    "one of the motivating questions of this paper is : what axioms connecting two independent galois connections @xmath57 and @xmath58 should be added to obtain intuitionistic ( or intermediate ) tense logic ?    in classical logic , the operators @xmath14 and @xmath15 may be defined as a shorthand of each other by using the following _ de morgan definitions _ :",
    "@xmath59 classical tense logic k@xmath0 can be obtained by adding to classical logic two galois connections @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and then connecting them by the following _ de  morgan axioms _ : @xmath62 or @xmath63 note that in the case of classical logic , the formulas in are equivalent to the ones in . in a more concise way , k@xmath0",
    "may be determined by adding to classical logic one galois connection @xmath60 , and then defining the second one @xmath61 in terms of , that is , by setting @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "this approach is present in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  8.5(iii ) ) and also , in another , independent way , in @xcite .",
    "however , if one changes the base logic from classical to intuitionistic , or algebraically from boolean to heyting algebras , these kinds of ways can not be used , because they lead to serious faults and fallacies . in particular , having a galois connection @xmath2 , if one defines the operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 by using with intuitionistic negation , the resulting pair @xmath3 does not form a galois connection ; see @xcite . in another similar approach @xcite ( without using the term galois connection , but providing the equivalent axiomatisation ) , the assertions are used to define `` possibility - like '' tense operators @xmath18 , @xmath20 , over intuitionistic logic , from `` necessity - like '' tense operators @xmath19 , @xmath21 . it is claimed in @xcite that the resulting logic is intuitionistic tense logic and that the `` possibility - like '' tense operators @xmath18 , @xmath20 are `` existential quantifiers '' ( see ( * ? ? ? * remark  8) ) meaning , in particular , that @xmath18 , @xmath20 preserve disjunctions ( that is , lattice - joins ) . showing that this is not true is the topic of @xcite .",
    "note also that in example  [ exa : motivation](c ) we show that in @xmath66 , formulas and are not provable .    by the above , it is clear that de  morgan axioms and are not appropriate for connecting modalities over intuitionistic logic due to the properties of intuitionistic negation .",
    "our answer to the above question on intuitionistic logic level is to link the operators @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 , respectively , by using the `` connecting axioms '' @xmath67 introduced by g.  fischer servi in @xcite .",
    "note that in these axioms , negation is not involved . to define int2gc+fs , the two galois connections @xmath57 and @xmath58 of int2gc are interlinked with the axioms :    = [ eq : fs](fs1 ) @xmath68 ( fs2 ) @xmath69 + ( fs3 ) @xmath70(fs4 ) @xmath71    we will show that in int2gc , axioms ( fs1 ) and ( fs4 ) are equivalent , and the same holds for ( fs2 ) and ( fs3 ) , meaning that we have some equivalent combinations of axioms to define int2gc+fs , and thus also ik@xmath0 .    another way of connecting two independent galois connections , if one moves from boolean to distributive lattices , is based on j.  m.  dunn s axioms .",
    "these axioms connect modalities in positive modal logic . in @xcite ,",
    "dunn studied distributive lattices with two modal operators @xmath15 and @xmath14 and introduced conditions @xmath72 for the interactions between @xmath15 and @xmath14 .",
    "we use only the first of them , the second is false in ik@xmath0 .",
    "in fact , in heyting algebras with two galois connections , the conditions of are independent of each other .",
    "one obtains a logic equivalent to ik@xmath0 by adding to int2gc axioms corresponding to the first condition of applied to the pairs @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the axioms are `` positive ''  negation is not present in distributive lattices .",
    "one may say that the role of linking two galois connections played by de  morgan axioms in classical logic is taken by fischer servi axioms or by ( positive ) dunn s axioms , in intuitionistic logic and , more general , in intermediate logics .    the next motivation of the paper is to show completeness of the logic for both algebraic and relational semantics , and to find a representation theorem for heyting algebras with galois connections via relational intuitionistic - modal frames .",
    "we consider h2gc+fs - algebras , which are algebras @xmath75 such that @xmath76 and @xmath77 are hgc - algebras modelling intgc @xcite , and @xmath78 and @xmath79 are so - called hk1-algebras introduced by e.  orowska and i.  rewitzky in @xcite .",
    "we note that int2gc+fs is complete with respect to h2gc+fs - algebras , and we generalise this result to completeness of the logic l2gc+fs for any intermediate logic l , with respect to l - heyting algebras extended with two galois connection pairs interlinked with fischer servi axioms .",
    "we also note that calculating using heyting algebras with operators is much easier than calculating with categories , and calculating with algebras can be easily used in showing some of the non - theorems , for instance , that all dunn s axioms   are not true in ik@xmath0 .",
    "we recall ik - frames from @xcite and show that int2gc+fs is complete with respect to the models defined on ik - frames .",
    "in addition , we prove a representation theorem for h2gc+fs - algebras : every h2gc+fs - algebra can be embedded into the complex algebra of its canonical ik - frame .",
    "this is a non - classical generalisation of b.  jnsson and a.  tarski @xcite representation of boolean algebras with operators .",
    "note that `` complex algebra '' is a commonly used name for the standard construction of an algebra of a certain type from a given frame , developed in @xcite .",
    "contrary to the case of algebraic semantics , relational semantics adequate for l2gc+fs does not necessarily exist for every intermediate logic l , because l may itself be kripke - incomplete . hence , relational completeness and the representation theorem for h@xmath802gc+fs - algebras for other intermediate logics l are left for a separate study .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : axiomatisations ] , we recall the logic intgc introduced by the authors in @xcite .",
    "we show that in the fusion of two intgc logics with two independent galois connection pairs @xmath2 and @xmath81 , axioms ( fs1 ) and ( fs4 ) are equivalent , and so are ( fs2 ) and ( fs3 ) .",
    "logic int2gc+fs is then defined as a fusion of two intgcs plus two axioms ( fs1 ) and ( fs2 ) added .",
    "we note that int2gc+fs can be regarded as an intuitionistic bi - modal logic , and the pairs @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 are intuitionistic modal connectives in the sense of fischer servi .",
    "in fact , int2gc+fs extends the fusion ik@xmath1ik by the browerian axioms , and this gives us the procedure ( b ) .",
    "we also prove that int2gc+fs is syntactically equivalent to intuitionistic tense logic ik@xmath0 .",

    "we also give a representation theorem stating that any h2gc+fs - algebra can be embedded into the complex algebra of its canonical ik - frame .",
    "the paper ends with some concluding remarks .",
    "we begin recalling the intuitionistic propositional logic with a galois connection ( intgc ) defined by the authors in @xcite .",
    "the language of intgc is constructed from an enumerable infinite set of propositional variables @xmath82 , the connectives @xmath83 , @xmath53 , @xmath55 , @xmath84 , and the unary operators @xmath14 and @xmath17 . the constant _ true _ is defined by setting @xmath85 for some fixed propositional variable @xmath86 , and the constant _ false _ is defined by @xmath87 .",
