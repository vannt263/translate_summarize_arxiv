    "statistical physics has been used to study social dynamics when we are looking for the simplest and most important properties exhibited by a given system . indeed , since the qualitative properties of large - scale phenomena do not depend on the microscopic details of the process , only higher level features , such as symmetries , topologies , or conservation laws , are relevant for the global behavior @xcite .",
    "the identification of influential spreaders @xcite , the creation process of social networks @xcite , how the opinions and extreme opinions are formed @xcite , and how the emergence of consensus is obtained @xcite are some subjects where the statistical physics finds a plethora of applications .    to address the question about the emergence of a majority - state when more than two states are possible , we consider the collective behavior of the three - state block voter model ( bvm ) @xcite , which introduces long - range interactions in the system .",
    "the bvm is defined by an outflow dynamics where a central set of @xmath0 spins , denoted by persuasive cluster spins ( pcs ) , tries to influence the opinion of their neighboring counterparts .",
    "however , a given spin been influenced offers a persuasion resistance measured by the noise parameter @xmath1 , the probability that a spin adopts a state contrary of the majority state of the majority of the spins inside the pcs .",
    "precisely , in this work we perform numerical simulations of the three - state bvm model on two - dimensional square lattices , in the @xmath2 parameter space , where @xmath1 and @xmath0 may be regarded as the social temperature and social pressure of the system , respectively .    after ref .",
    "@xcite , consensus is defined by a configuration in which all agents share the same state .",
    "therefore , due to the presence of the noisy @xmath1 , the consensus state is never reached for the three - state bvm , except for @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , only polarizations and fragmentations are observed for @xmath4 .",
    "polarization happens when many states are possible but only two of them survive in the population .",
    "and fragmentation indicates a configuration with more than two surviving states .",
    "the bvm do not satisfy the condition of detailed balance , and therefore the zeroth law of thermodynamics is not satisfied .",
    "this feature is shared with other studied irreversible models @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 defines the range of interactions and we consider the scenario of medium - range interactions @xcite . for the case where only two states are possible",
    ", the bvm shows a continuous order - disorder phase transition with critical exponents described by ising universality class .",
    "moreover , the long - range exponents that govern the decay of the critical amplitudes of the magnetization , the susceptibility , and the derivative of binder s cumulant , with the range of interaction , were also calculated @xcite . here , we extend the study of @xcite to determine the phase diagram and critical behavior of the three - state block voter model",
    ".    the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the main features of the three - state block voter model dynamics used to determine the time evolution of the spin variables associated to each vertex defined on regular lattices . in section iii the results of our simulations are presented and the finite - size scaling analysis is used to investigate the critical properties of the model .",
    "we conclude in section iv .",
    "the three - state block voter model is defined by a set of @xmath5 spins , where the spin variable @xmath6 is associated with the i - th vertex of a regular square lattice of linear size @xmath7 .",
    "each spin can have three possible values @xmath8 , corresponding to the three possible opinions in a referendum .",
    "starting from a given spin configuration with periodic boundary conditions in both directions , the system evolves in time according to the following rules .",
    "firstly , a square block consisting of @xmath0 persuasive cluster spins @xmath9 is randomly chosen and the majority state of this block is determined .",
    "next , a randomly chosen spin located at the adjacency of @xmath10 has its state updated : with probability @xmath11 the new state of the adjacent spin agrees with the @xmath10 majority state and it disagrees with probability @xmath1 .",
    "notice that , both the noise @xmath1 and the size @xmath0 of the persuasive block spin are fixed in time . in this two - parameter model , the parameter @xmath1 can be viewed as a social temperature defining the resistance to persuasion of the @xmath10 , whereas @xmath0 determines the power of persuasion and it can be thought as a measure of social pressure . moreover ,",
    "different tie configurations must be considered . in the case of a tie among the three possible states ,",
    "each state is chosen with equal probability . in the case of a tie between two majority states ,",
    "the adjacent spin assumes each one of these states with equal probability @xmath12 , and the minority state with probability @xmath1 .",
    "finally , in the case of a single majority state , the two minority states occur with the same probability @xmath13 , and the majority state with probability @xmath11 .",
    "as described in @xcite , these rules present the @xmath14 symmetry with respect to the simultaneous change of all states @xmath15 .    to account for the phase diagram and critical behavior of the model in the @xmath16 parameter space",

    "our results for the critical noise @xmath57 and for the critical cumulant @xmath45 are presented in table  i. as we can notice , there exists a strong dependence between the critical noise and the size of the persuasive cluster , since as @xmath0 increases the critical noise also increases . on the contrary ,",

    "the critical curve , constituted by the critical points obtained from binder s cumulant , separates the ordered @xmath62 and disordered @xmath63 phases .",
    "as can be noticed , the critical noise @xmath40 increases monotonically with the control parameter @xmath0 .",
    "this reflects the fact that larger values of @xmath0 result in larger values of critical noise necessary to destroy the formation of a majority opinion .",
    "also we notice that in the present three - state model a larger ordered region emerges , when compared to a smaller one previously obtained for the two - state model ( squares)@xcite . this is a reasonable result , because now one can select one out of three possible states during the process of formation of a majority opinion .",

    "[ fig03](c ) shows the system in the disordered phase where the magnetization is null , since each one of the three possible states ( opinions ) is equally likely to be selected .",
    "we now apply the finite - size scaling theory ( fss ) @xcite in order to obtain the finite - size dependence of the results of monte carlo calculations on finite lattices and to investigate the critical behavior of the system .",
    "in fact , by performing the extrapolation of our numerical results to the limit ( @xmath42 ) , we determine the corresponding physical quantities in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this analysis yields good estimates for the critical exponents and critical parameters , as well as the universal functions representing the collapse of the data for several values of @xmath54 , and @xmath0 .",
    "however , the presence of long - ranged interactions described by the parameter @xmath0 has influence on the nature of both the phase diagram and the critical fluctuations .",
    "therefore , in order to take into account the reduction of the critical amplitudes with increasing range of interactions , we should consider the following ansatz for the scaling equations @xcite    @xmath66    @xmath67    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the distance from the critical noise @xmath40 and @xmath48 is the correlation length exponent .",
