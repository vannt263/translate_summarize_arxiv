    "second , the rate of suppression of the coherent oscillations due to the combined effect of decoherence and thermal averaging was observed to be around three times larger in the local geometry .",

    "the two exchanged electrons have however no phase - relation which leads to a suppression of coherence in the dot . using the diagrammatic theory of ref .",
    "@xcite it is possible to calculate the average conductance of the system including the voltage probe and we obtain @xmath174.\\ ] ] note that in the limits @xmath135 and @xmath136 we correctly recover the result for the conductance of a simple chaotic dot .",
    "in contrast to a single fluctuating potential the voltage probe leads to decoherence of the full weak - localization correction . in principle one could also attach the voltage probe directly to the ring instead of attaching it to the quantum dot . in this case",
    "the result would be similar to eq .",
    "( [ cond ] ) since a voltage probe attached to the ring will not suppress interference between trajectories in the dot .",
    "in this work we have investigated charge - fluctuation - induced decoherence of ab oscillations in mesoscopic interferometers . as a first example we looked at an interferometer without backscattering , the electronic equivalent of an optical mach - zehnder interferometer . employing a time - dependent scattering approach we have been able to relate the suppression of coherent aharonov - bohm oscillations to the spectrum of internal potential fluctuations .",
    "then , specializing to the case where both arms of the ring are described by a single potential each , we have explicitly calculated the decoherence rate . within our model",
    "the decoherence rate is linear in temperature as observed in refs .",
    "we also demonstrated that the potential fluctuations and thus the decoherence rate can strongly depend on the external measurement circuit .",
    "this provides an explanation of the measurement configuration dependence of the decoherence rate in a four - terminal mesoscopic ring reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as a second example we studied a mesoscopic ring with a chaotic dot included in its arm . this has allowed us to take into account backscattering and channel mixing .",
    "also , contrary to the case of the mzi where we were mainly interested in the single - channel limit , we have allowed for a large number of channels in the ring . making the assumption that interactions take place mainly in the dot and describing the dot by a single internal potential we could again relate the decoherence rate to the potential fluctuation spectrum .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the conductors considered here do not have to be charge neutral . to the contrary , an open mesoscopic conductor",
    "can easily be charged up relative to its surroundings by exchanging charge with the reservoirs",
    ". charge exchange between conductor and reservoir is an important source of dephasing .",
    "this is reflected in the dependence of the dephasing rates we have calculated above on the charge relaxation resistance @xmath132 .",
    "the charge relaxation resistance is a measure of the energy dissipated as a charge carrier relaxes into a reservoir .",
    "charge relaxation becomes easier the more channels are open in the leads connecting conductor and reservoirs . in consequence deviations from charge neutrality are evened out quicker and charge fluctuations become less pronounced .",
    "this , in turn leads to a smaller decoherence rate .",
    "there are many interesting venues leading beyond the material presented here .",
    "clearly , it would be interesting to go beyond the single potential approximation to determine the decoherence rate for a mesoscopic interferometer .",
    "such a generalization would become necessary if one was interested to know how charge fluctuations suppress the weak localization correction to the conductance of a quantum dot .",
    "this work was supported by the swiss national science foundation ."
