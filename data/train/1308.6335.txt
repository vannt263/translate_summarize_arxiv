    "in the past few years , there have been many exciting developments in the program of finding black hole microstate geometries .",
    "these are solitonic solutions to supergravity theories which have the same asymptotic behavior as a given black hole ( or black ring ) , including mass , charge , and angular momentum , and yet in the bulk remain totally smooth and free of horizons . instead",
    ", the pathological parts of the would - be black hole are resolved by a collection of smooth , topological bubbles , threaded by cohomological fluxes which hold the whole thing up against gravitational collapse .",
    "it is conjectured that such geometries may provide the  hair \" necessary to store the entropy of the black hole ( or black ring ) @xcite , and can be interpreted as supergravity approximations to the stringy states ( or  fuzzballs \" ) thought to resolve the information paradox @xcite .",
    "beyond specifically finding smooth microstate geometries , this program is of general interest for providing numerous examples of stationary supergravity solutions containing arbitrary collections of charged , rotating black holes and rings balanced by their mutual electromagnetic interactions .    of central importance to this program is the discovery that the bps equations for 5-dimensional , @xmath2 supergravity coupled to vector multiplets can be cast as a _ linear system _ @xcite . from this",
    "came a whole body of work on bps solutions , extending previously - known families of solutions and uncovering new ones ; especially leading to the construction of the  bubbling microstate geometries \" , or solitons made of pure topological bubbles and fluxes @xcite .",
    "these solutions are constructed with a time fiber over a hyper - khler gibbons - hawking ( gh ) base @xcite , which contains topologically non - trivial 2-cycles supported by harmonic fluxes . in particular , one finds a set of  bubble equations \" , which arise from demanding the absence of closed timelike curves .",
    "the bubble equations relate the cohomological fluxes to the sizes of the homological bubbles to which they are linked ; thus , the bubbles are literally held open by the fluxes .",
    "more recently , there have been several attempts to get away from bps .",
    "a few isolated examples exist @xcite of truly non - bps , non - extremal smooth geometries , but no infinite familes are yet known ( which are necessary for entropy counting ) .",
    "however , in the non - bps _ extremal _ case , there are linear systems which can be solved to obtain infinite families of solutions .",
    "one such family are the so - called  almost bps \" solutions @xcite , where supersymmetry is broken by inverting the orientation of the gibbons - hawking base relative to the fluxes .",
    "these solutions have been shown to exhibit a rich variety of phenomena not seen in the bps case @xcite .",
    "a further avenue of attack was revealed with the  floating brane \" ansatz in 5 dimensions , which dispenses with supersymmetry , but still imposes a generic balance between gravitational and electromagnetic forces .",
    "it was found that this leads to yet another _ linear system _ of equations , this time on a euclidean - signature einstein - maxwell base @xcite .",
    "a few solutions are known based on various euclidean - einstein - maxwell geometries analytically continued from classical gr ones @xcite , as well as an infinite family given in @xcite based on the israel - wilson metric .    in a pair of recent papers @xcite , the author and collaborators",
    "have presented an infinite family of  floating brane \" non - bps solutions based on a family of khler einstein - maxwell metrics studied by lebrun @xcite .",
    "these metrics are determined by two functions which solve the @xmath1 toda equation and its linearization . by choosing an extremely simple solution to the toda equation ,",
    "one obtains the subclass of lebrun - burns metrics , which are khler analogues to gibbons - hawking metrics with a hyperbolic base instead of flat @xmath3 . on the lebrun - burns base ,",
    "the floating brane equations are solvable and one obtains an infinite family of solutions .",
    "these solutions were shown to have a few desirable properties .",
    "the lebrun - burns metrics have the structure of a @xmath0 fiber over @xmath4 . in much the same way as gibbons - hawking metrics , this @xmath0 fiber pinches off at controlled points , which allows one to construct solutions with several  bubbles \" threaded with cohomological fluxes .",
    "it was also shown that with appropriate choices of parameters , the solutions could be made regular and free of ctc s .    however , these solutions also had a few shortcomings .",
    "the maxwell field of the lebrun - burns metrics is topologically trivial .",
    "hence , while one can use the @xmath0 fiber to form 2-cycles , only two of the three fluxes thread those 2-cycles . the resulting  bubble equations \"",
    "turn out to be independent of the sizes of the bubbles , and thus the interplay between bubbles and fluxes is gone .",
    "furthermore , the solution is very degenerate , because it effectively has only two types of dipole charges . as a result",
    ", the regularity conditions actually demand that most of the parameters be set to zero .",
    "finally , the solutions are not asymptotically flat ; in fact , it was shown that the floating brane equations on a khler base have no asymptotically - flat solutions in general @xcite .",
    "this last shortcoming should not be all too great a concern .",
    "one does obtain solutions whose asymptotics are like the near - horizon limit of a bmpv black hole @xcite .",
    "so it is not too far a stretch to say that these are bmpv microstate geometries , and probably the asymptotic region can be restored by relaxing the assumptions of the floating brane ansatz .",
    "yet another linear system of equations was discovered by re - organizing the bps equations in the 6-dimensional iib frame @xcite , which makes a curious connection to the 5-dimensional story : the 5-dimensional non - bps , floating brane equations on a khler base are _ identical _ to the 6-dimensional bps equations where all functions are made independent of the 6th coordinate @xcite .",
    "therefore the exact same family of solutions plays two roles , both supersymmetric and non - supersymmetric .",
    "the apparent discrepancy is explained in the kk reduction from 6 to 5 dimensions : the killing spinor in 6 dimensions can be charged under the @xmath0 on which the reduction occurs , which causes it to vanish in 5 dimensions .",
    "this is reminiscent of the scherk - schwarz mechanism @xcite , or also  supersymmetry without supersymmetry \" @xcite .    in this paper , we improve upon the results of @xcite and overcome its major issues . despite the 5d-6d link mentioned , we work strictly in the 5-dimensional frame , as it is the simpler of the two .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we briefly describe the 5d @xmath2 theory , the floating brane ansatz , and the equations that result . in section 3 , we describe the basic features of lebrun metrics in general , and the system that results from putting the floating brane equations on the lebrun base .",
    "we show how the system is solved generically . in section 4 ,",
    "we solve the @xmath1 toda equation explicitly under the assumption of an additional @xmath0 isometry .",
    "we determine the boundary conditions needed for the solutions we wish to build , and we analyze the resulting base manifold in detail to explore its geometric and topological properties . in section 5 ,",
    "we solve the floating brane equations on this base manifold explicitly , thus giving the full supergravity solution .",
    "we determine the conditions needed to make solutions regular in 5 dimensions .",
    "we derive the no - ctc conditions , or  bubble equations \" and analyze them . finally , we give an explicit , solved example of a 3-center solution . in section 6 ,",
    "we present our conclusions .",
    "it is simplest to present our solutions in the context of @xmath2 ungauged supergravity in 5 dimensions coupled to two vector multiplets ( thus having three @xmath0 gauge fields ) .",
    "one can also see this theory as a truncation of eleven - dimensional supergravity on @xmath5 .",
    "the 5-dimensional action is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the ricci scalar , @xmath8 are scalar fields , @xmath9 are three maxwell fields , and the kinetic terms are coupled via the matrix @xmath10 the scalar fields are subject to the constraint @xmath11 , which we parametrize in terms of a new set of scalars @xmath12 as @xmath13 these new scalars @xmath12 are very convenient in the anstze to follow .",
    "we begin with the usual 5d metric ansatz , @xmath14 with 4d base manifold @xmath15 . following @xcite ,",
    "the maxwell fields are then given by the  floating brane \" ansatz , @xmath16 and it is convenient to introduce the magnetic 2-forms given by @xmath17 for completeness , we also give the embedding into 11-dimensional supergravity . the 11-dimensional metric and 3-form potential",
    "are given by @xmath18 where we see that the three scalars @xmath19 come from the sizes of three @xmath20 s inside the @xmath5 spanned by the coordinates @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , for the @xmath5 to remain compact , the @xmath12 must be everywhere finite and nonzero ; or , if any of the @xmath22 or @xmath23 , they must all do so with the same behavior .",
    "returning to the 5-dimensional theory , as was shown in @xcite , we then need a 4-dimensional base manifold that solves the euclidean - signature einstein - maxwell equations , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a maxwell 2-form determined by the base geometry , and unrelated to the @xmath26 .",
    "we decompose @xmath25 as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is self - dual , and @xmath29 is anti - self - dual .",
    "the maxwell equations @xmath30 imply that @xmath31 and @xmath32 are harmonic .",
    "as the notation implies , this defines the magnetic 2-form field strength @xmath31 .",
    "the equations of motion of then reduce to the linear system @xcite : @xmath33 and @xmath34 we solve the equations of motion by the following steps : first , find a euclidean - einstein - maxwell base .",
    "the maxwell 2-form defines the 2-forms @xmath28 and @xmath29 via .",
    "we then solve the first layer of coupled linear equations and for @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "these enter as sources in the second layer of coupled linear equations and , which we solve finally for @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "next we follow @xcite and implement this solution for the lebrun metrics .",
    "the lebrun family of metrics @xcite is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is periodic with period @xmath41 .",
    "the functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 are independent of @xmath40 and solve the @xmath1 toda equation and its linearization , respectively : @xmath44 and the 1-form @xmath45 satisfies @xmath46 under the conditions and , the metric is khler , with khler form @xmath47 the condition further implies that the ricci scalar vanishes @xcite .",
    "we choose to introduce the frames , @xmath48 with orientation @xmath49 such that @xmath50 is anti - self - dual .",
    "it will also be helpful to define the ( anti)-self - dual 2-forms @xmath51 such that @xmath52 .",
    "the lebrun metrics have the structure of a @xmath0 fiber over a 3-dimensional base with metric @xmath53 which in turn can be thought of as a riemann surface fibered over a line . if @xmath54 is everywhere finite and non - singular , then the @xmath55 coordinates can be extended to a topological @xmath3 . in this case",
    ", the topology of the 4-manifold can be analyzed in terms of the @xmath0 fiber parametrized by @xmath40 , much like the topology of gibbons - hawking manifolds @xcite .",
    "fiber pinches off at the points @xmath56 . sweeping the fiber along a path between any two points forms a homological 2-sphere .",
    "two intersecting 2-cycles are shown.__,height=113 ]    the function @xmath43 solves a second - order laplace - like equation , whose solutions are characterized by a number of points we will call  gibbons - hawking points \" or  geometric charges \" , where locally ( provided that @xmath54 is smooth ) , @xmath57 for some local radial distance @xmath58 . at these points",
    "the @xmath40 fiber pinches off to zero size . hence ,",
    "if one takes any curve in the 3-dimensional base @xmath59 that joins two geometric charges , the surface described by the @xmath40 fiber over this curve is a homological 2-sphere , as in fig .",
    "[ cycles ] .",
    "if @xmath54 is not smooth , it is still possible that @xmath60 is smooth .",
    "one possibility is that @xmath61 is a radial coordinate , and @xmath62 describes a sphere ( or perhaps a quotient of a sphere ) .",
    "another possibility is that @xmath62 is a higher - genus riemann surface , in which case one can have topological cycles that do not involve the @xmath40 fiber .",
    "some of these additional topological features will appear in the solutions presented in this paper .",
    "one can show @xcite that self - dual , harmonic 2-forms on lebrun spaces can be written @xmath63 where @xmath64 solves and @xmath65 is taken with respect to the 3-metric @xmath66 by differentiating with respect to @xmath61 , one can show that @xmath67 solves .",
    "so define the maxwell 2-form @xmath68 then @xmath69 solve the euclidean - einstein - maxwell equations @xcite .    for simplicity in matching with",
    "the linear system found in @xcite , we choose @xmath70 , and hence @xmath71      next we solve the system , , , on the lebrun base .",
    "we will find it convenient to define @xmath72 to solve the first layer , one makes the anstze @xmath73 this leads to the linear equations @xmath74 and @xmath75 to solve the second layer , make the anstze @xmath76 then the new functions @xmath77 and @xmath78 satisfy the equations @xmath79 and the 1-form @xmath80 satisfies @xmath81 therefore , to solve the  floating brane \" system on the lebrun base , one first finds a function @xmath42 that solves the @xmath1 toda equation , which also defines the function @xmath82 .",
    "then one solves [ lintoda , l1 l2 eqns , k1 eqn , k2 eqn , m eqn , l3 eqn ] , in this order , for the seven remaining functions @xmath83 and @xmath77 .",
    "finally , one must solve for the 1-form @xmath80 .",
    "before we discuss solutions to the full system , we will explore the base space @xmath60 in detail .",
    "our task is to solve the @xmath1 toda equation which , while known to be integrable , is also notoriously hard .",
    "however , if we impose an additional @xmath0 symmetry , there is a known method of attack @xcite .",
    "first let us write the lebrun metric in an explicitly @xmath84-invariant form , @xmath85 where now all functions depend on @xmath86 only . for completeness ,",
    "the equations to be solved in these coordinates become @xmath87 and @xmath88 at this point , we can solve and generically . to accomplish this , note that the laplacian on the 3-dimensional base @xmath59 is given by @xmath89 and hence the laplacian",
    "is related to the linearized toda equation via @xmath90 : @xmath91 therefore if we take some @xmath92 which solves the laplace equation on @xmath59 @xmath93 then it is easy to show that and are solved by @xmath94 one can think of @xmath92 as a  potential \" that gives us the solutions for @xmath43 and @xmath45 .",
    "now let us focus on the toda equation with an axial symmetry .",
    "the additional @xmath0 symmetry allows one to make a bcklund transformation to new coordinates @xmath95 @xcite : @xmath96 the toda equation then reduces to the axisymmetric laplace equation , while forgetting the old coordinates . in section [ boundary cond ]",
    "we will discuss the source terms in the new coordinates which should appear in the right - hand - side of .",
    "we remain agnostic about the exact form of the source terms as they would appear in the original coordinates , as this information is not necessary for constructing supergravity solutions . ] in @xmath3 in cylindrical coordinates : @xmath97 in principle , one must then invert the transformation to obtain @xmath42 . but in practice , for most functions @xmath98 this is intractable .",
    "it is easier to change the metric to the new coordinates @xmath95 , which results in @xmath99 we should note that as a result of the transformations , the cylindrical coordinates @xmath100 inherit the orientation opposite to the usual : @xmath101    we must also change and into the new coordinates .",
    "the laplacian @xmath102 becomes , up to an overall factor , the cylindrically - symmetric laplacian on @xmath3 , @xmath103 and so the potential @xmath92 solves @xmath104 whose solutions we know well",
    ". then @xmath43 and @xmath45 are given by @xmath105 and @xmath106 therefore , the geometric data of the base space are determined in terms of two functions @xmath107 that solve the axisymmetric laplace equation in @xmath3 .",
    "the task of writing an explicit base space is then reduced to solving cylindrically symmetric electrostatics problems in @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the question is what kinds of electrostatic problems give interesting solutions .    by analogy with bps solutions on gibbons - hawking bases",
    "@xcite , we expect to specify a collection of points along the @xmath108 axis where @xmath43 and @xmath82 have poles .",
    "the poles of @xmath43 control where the @xmath40 fiber pinches off , thus creating a series of homology 2-cycles ( provided that the 3-dimensional base @xmath59 remain smooth at these points ) .",
    "the poles of @xmath67 control sources of @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath67 has a pole where @xmath43 does not , we expect a singularity in the metric .",
    "but if @xmath67 has poles coincident with poles of @xmath43 , we expect that the base geometry be smooth ( up to orbifold identifications ) , and such poles should control the fluxes of @xmath28 on the adjacent 2-cycles .    in the simplest case , we consider where @xmath43 and @xmath67 each have a single , coincident pole .",
    "since both @xmath43 and @xmath67 solve the same elliptic linear pde [ lintoda ] ( with the same boundary condition at infinity ) and have only one `` source point '' , it follows that @xmath43 and @xmath67 are proportional .",
    "hence @xmath109 and the metric is ricci - flat ( and therefore hyper - khler)thus the metric [ lebrun axi ] should be a gibbons - hawking metric , in alternative coordinates gives not a gibbons - hawking metric , but a more general hyper - khler manifold .",
    "however , if we set @xmath110 in the @xmath84-invariant ansatz of [ lebrun axi ] , there is always some linear combination of the @xmath0 s which is tri - holomorphic , hence the manifold must in fact be gibbons - hawking but written in unusual coordinates . ] .",
    "looking at , we identify @xmath61 as the radial coordinate from the source point , and take @xmath111 to be stereographic coordinates on an @xmath112 .",
    "hence we can write @xmath113 where @xmath114 is any integer . then as @xmath115",
    ", the metric is simply the flat metric on @xmath116 .",
    "this gives the canonical example of coincident poles in @xmath117 .",
    "we expect that near any location where @xmath117 both blow up , the metric will locally have this form .    to get a function @xmath67 with many poles , we should choose a cylindrically - symmetric laplace solution @xmath98 that gives rise to the behavior in , and then use linearity to combine several solutions at centered at different points . using the bcklund transformation [ toda trans ] , we have @xmath118 where the center equality is the boundary condition we need to satisfy near the source point in order for @xmath67 to have the appropriate singular behavior . we see that while the cylindrically - symmetric laplace equation for @xmath98 is linear , the boundary condition for @xmath98 is nonlinear . to solve this boundary condition",
    ", one can guess a few known possibilities for @xmath98 .",
    "it turns out the appropriate choice is also the most obvious one to give a pole in the numerator : @xmath119 integrating this twice with respect to @xmath108 and choosing appropriate integration constants , we find @xmath120 then we have @xmath121 and hence @xmath122 and the boundary condition is satisfied .",
    "so we can write a solution with @xmath123 such poles as @xmath124 where @xmath125 are the locations of the poles on the @xmath108 axis .    .",
    "@xmath126 is a line charge density profile along the @xmath108 axis , which is piecewise linear with",

    "the details are given in appendix [ orbifold groups ] .",

    "second , we can ask when the orbifold point at @xmath148 is similar to the orbifold point of a charge @xmath186 gibbons - hawking metric . these are points where @xmath200 and the action of @xmath201 is in the diagonal @xmath0 of the maximal torus @xmath202 .",
    "we find that such orbifold points occur whenever : @xmath203 one can also consider @xmath200 acting in the _",

    "; i.e. by rotating @xmath206 and leaving @xmath207 fixed . however , the `` diagonal '' rotations discussed above act in both planes and do not fix any point aside from the origin .",
    "one can also obtain more general rotations that rotate both @xmath206 and @xmath207 planes by unequal amounts .    in any case",
    ", an orbifold singularity with a finite group action such as @xmath144 is benign in string theory @xcite , so in the context of microstate geometries , we will count such points as regular .      in the asymptotic region of the base metric ,",

    "we first consider the case that all three @xmath12 have the same asymptotic behavior .",

    "this is because they are trivial kk reductions of 6-dimensional geometries which are bps in the iib frame @xcite .",
    "ultimately , there are only @xmath379 independent @xmath375 , so we expect there to be @xmath379 independent bubble equations .",

    "hence as expected , the bubble equations constitute @xmath379 independent equations in the @xmath379 independent variables @xmath375 .",
    "finally , there is a curious thing that happens if we impose all of the conditions derived in [ asymptotics ] for near - horizon bmpv - like ( i.e. warped , rotating @xmath321 ) asymptotics .",
    "first we note that the value of @xmath315 in [ l30 const ] is entirely a linear combation of the inverse bubble diameters @xmath378 .",
    "second , when [ l30 const ] is imposed , then @xmath383 as in [ m0 soln ] , [ w0 soln ] .",
    "therefore if we insist on near - horizon bmpv - like asymptotics , the bubble equations will take the form , schematically , @xmath384 if we instead think of this equation as a limiting process where we replace the right - hand side with some @xmath385 and let @xmath386 , then the solutions , as we follow this process , are _ scaling solutions _ @xcite .",
    "the right - hand side roughly scales as @xmath387 , and thus if we adjust the dipole charges while simultaneously shrinking the bubble diameters , such that @xmath388 for @xmath389 small , this tends toward zero . in such solutions , the overall size of the bubbled region shrinks ( as measured in the 3-dimensional base ) , while the ratios between the bubble sizes becomes constant .",
    "in the full 5-dimensional metric , this represents the appearance of an arbitrarily deep throat , smoothly capped off by topological bubbles at some finite depth .",
    "thus one can see the near - horizon bmpv geometry , and the related rotating-@xmath390-like metrics with angular dependence as in [ 5d asym form ] , as the result of this limiting procedure .",
    "more generally , if we consider asymptotic conditions where @xmath37 behaves differently from @xmath308 ( thus naturally lifting to the 6d iib metric [ pp wave ] rather than to 11d supergravity ) , we can set the constant @xmath315 to anything we like . in this case , one can find finite , non - trivial solutions to the bubble equations without subjecting them to a limiting procedure . we demonstrate this in [ example sec ] .",

    "most of the functions @xmath397 that make up the solution are too lengthy to write out , but as an example , we have @xmath398 and so on . there are two remaining constants @xmath399 which we have not set in [ charges ] . to meet the regularity conditions at infinity",

    "these metrics have an explicit @xmath0 fiber that pinches off at various points along the axis to create a series of homological 2-spheres .",

    "the regularity conditions take virtually the same form . by demanding the absence of ctc s",

    "it is known from previous work that these 5-dimensional non - supersymmetric solutions on a khler base are actually trivial kk reductions of _ bps _ solutions in the 6-dimensional iib frame @xcite .",
    "this explains some of the features we see , and yet makes others more mysterious .",

    "for example , the bubble equations here and in the traditional 5d bps solutions are both linear in the inverse distances @xmath378 , whereas the  almost bps \" bubble equations are cubic in the inverse distances .",
    "still , there are important differences between these bubble equations and the 5d bps bubble equations that must be explained if we are to think of these as  secretly bps . \"",
    "having found the non - bps bubble equations , we also find that imposing the asymptotics of the near - horizon bmpv metric @xcite precludes the existence of any finitely - sized bubbled solutions .",
    "however , one can see the near - horizon bmpv - like metrics as the result of a limiting process of scaling solutions @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can lift to the 6d iib frame where one can allow different asymptotic behavior in one of the warp factors , and in this case one can find an infinite family of smooth geometries , with finitely - sized bubbles held open by their cohomological fluxes , which are asymptotic to a momentum wave solution on @xmath422 .",
    "it would be interesting to explore further the lift to the 6d iib frame , as was done with the lebrun - burns metrics in @xcite . in 6 dimensions ,",
    "one has the possibility of regular supertubes , and one might also get a better handle on why the bubble equations differ between here and the traditional setting ( particularly in containing non - local interactions )",
    ".    it would also be interesting to look for an asymptotically - flat completion of these solutions in 5 dimensions by relaxing the simplifying assumptions used in the floating brane ansatz @xcite .",
    "this is certainly a non - trivial thing to do , as one will likely be forced to address the full einstein equations .",
    "finally , we also point out that while this work has focused on smooth solutions , one also has within the same solution set an infinite family of singular solutions , representing various collections of non - supersymmetric , yet force - balanced , spinning 3-charge black rings .",
