    "thanks to _ swift _ observations , @xmath0-ray bursts ( grbs ) can be rapidly followed - up in various observation bands ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) . in particular ,",
    "some events have been observed in the optical band during the prompt @xmath0-ray  active phase ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is observational diversity in the prompt optical emission and several categories can be found as described in the following :    ( i )  the optical light curve synchronizes with the x - ray/@xmath0-ray light curve with the optical  to  x/@xmath0-ray flux ratio almost constant with time ( e.g. , grb  041219a ; * ? ? ?",
    "the peak flux ratio @xmath1 is from a few to ten .",
    "( ii )  the optical light curve is smooth and much less variable compared with x - ray/@xmath0-ray light curve ( e.g. , grb  060210 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the peak flux ratio @xmath2 is almost equal to or smaller than unity for grb  060210 .",
    "( iii )  the optical light curve is a superposition of a smooth component and a variable one synchronizing with x - ray/@xmath0-ray light curves ( e.g. , grb  050820a ; * ? ? ?",
    "this may be an intermediate case between cases ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "( iv )  a few events show bright optical flashes just after the @xmath0-ray  active phase .",
    "a typical example is grb  990123 @xcite , and for this event @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "grb  060111b may also be in this class @xcite .",
    "( v )  for a fraction of the events , uvot on _ swift _ detected no optical counterpart within @xmath4  sec after the bat trigger , and it gave strict upper limits on the prompt optical emission @xcite .",
    "although it is difficult to discuss quantitatively , some events may have dim prompt optical emission .",
    "the origin of the prompt optical emission has been widely discussed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the popular interpretation is that of case ( i ) , which postulates an internal shock origin @xcite , while case ( iv ) postulates an external reverse shock emission origin ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . case ( iii ) is a superposition of both components . in this letter , however , we will show that all of the cases are explained in the internal shock model .",
    "basically , we adopt the same model as in the previous works @xcite . however , in this letter , a much simplified version is considered .",
    "the central engine launches @xmath5-emitting shells in the same direction , with the lorentz factor @xmath6 and the opening half - angle of @xmath7 . we introduce the spherical coordinate system @xmath8 in the central engine frame , where the origin is the location of the central engine and @xmath9 is the axis of the whole jet .",
    "we assume that an observer sees the jet on - beam ( i.e. , in notation of our previous works , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , then @xmath13 ) .",
    "the departure time of each emitting shell @xmath14 is assumed to be homogeneously random between @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the duration time of the central engine in its own frame .",
    "the jet emission instantaneously arises at @xmath18 .",
    "then the observed flux @xmath19 at an observer time @xmath20 and at an observed frequency @xmath21 is a superposition of each shell emission calculated as @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the normalization constant . here",
    "@xmath25 is chosen as the time of arrival at the observer of a photon emitted at the origin at @xmath15 . in our model ,",
    "synchrotron radiation is considered . assuming the standard internal shock model and typical model parameters , the break frequencies at the on - beam observer",
    "are calculated as @xmath26  kev and @xmath27  ev , where we assume the bulk lorentz factor @xmath28 , the lorentz factor of the internal shock @xmath29 , the outflow luminosity @xmath30  erg  s@xmath31 , the observed typical variability timescale @xmath32  sec , and the shock microphysics parameters @xmath33 ( see eqs.(1)(3 ) in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the cooling frequency at the on - beam observer @xmath34",
    "is found to be much smaller than @xmath35 .",
    "note that considering several uncertainties of the parameters arising in the internal shock model , @xmath35 could be around the r - band frequency @xmath36  ev .",
    "then the spectral shape function , @xmath37 , is given by ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath38 which is different from that for the case @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "one should remark that for @xmath40 , @xmath37 has a steep slope because of the synchrotron self - absorption .",
    "we do nt consider the spectrum in the range @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectrum ] ) , because we assume @xmath42 based on the above order - of - magnitude estimation and then our result does not depend on the value of @xmath43 . in order to more accurately reproduce the observational properties such as @xmath2 , we may have to introduce another emission component that is responsible for the high - energy x - rays and/or @xmath0-rays in the observer frame , whose spectrum is characterized by the band function @xcite .",
    "however such a correction is neglected here for simplicity .",
    "the pulse starting and ending times of each shell emission are @xmath44 in this letter , the cosmological effect is neglected ( i.e. , we set @xmath45 ) . in the following ,",
    "we adopt the fiducial parameters @xmath46  cm , @xmath47 , @xmath48  rad , @xmath49  sec , @xmath50 , @xmath51  kev , and @xmath52 unless otherwise stated .",
    "we will see how the result changes if we change @xmath53 , which ranges between @xmath54  ev and 0.1  ev . we stress that the aim of this letter is to show that the observed diversity of the prompt optical emission can possibly be explained by our theoretical model .",
    "therefore , a thorough study of the dependence of the other parameters is beyond the scope of this letter and of future work .    before discussing further",
    ", one should note that since @xmath37 has a power - law form of @xmath55 , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : flux ] ) and ( [ eq : tau ] ) provide us with @xmath56 which is the same form as a well known formula that is believed to describe the steep decay phase in the early x - ray afterglow @xcite .",
    "if the absorption frequency at the observer , @xmath35 ( @xmath57 if @xmath58 ) , is below @xmath59 , then @xmath60 at @xmath59 , so that @xmath61 rapidly decreases with @xmath62 . on the other hand , if @xmath63 , then @xmath64 at @xmath59 , so that one can find @xmath65 . keeping this in mind , we expect that the optical behavior for @xmath66 is rather different from that for @xmath67 , and that the observed diversity of prompt optical phenomena arises when @xmath35 varies across @xmath59 . in this letter",
    ", we consider @xmath68 as a representative of the x - ray/@xmath0-ray light curve because as long as @xmath69  kev , the light curve @xmath70 shows almost the same behavior .",
    "the following five cases ( i)(v ) , correspond to those in   [ sec : intro ] :    ( i )  let us first consider the case @xmath71 . in this case , we obtain the light curves in the r - band ( @xmath36  ev ) and the x - ray band ( @xmath72  kev ) as @xmath73 where @xmath74/2 ~~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and we use the approximation @xmath75 . hence , both the optical and the x - ray light curves show rapid decay after the initial sudden rise , so that the optical behavior is similar to the x - ray behavior .",
    "when @xmath76 , we see many spikes as observed for typical bursts .",
    "in particular , the time of the maximum flux is the same in the optical and the x - ray bands . in figure  1a",
    ", we chose @xmath77  ev with other parameters being fiducial .",
    "the peak flux ratio is estimated as @xmath78 , which is larger than the observed value .",
    "if we consider the additional band function component which dominates only in the observed x - ray and @xmath0-ray bands , the value of @xmath2(@xmath79 several tens ) can be closer to the observed one .",
    "( ii )  next we consider the case @xmath80",
    ". then we derive @xmath81 while the x - ray light curve is again described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : lc_x ] ) .",
    "the optical light curve has a gradually increasing part whose duration is @xmath82 . in particular , in the case of @xmath83 , the difference between optical and x - ray behavior becomes significant . if @xmath84 and @xmath83 , all components are overlaid with each other at the time interval @xmath85 , resulting in a smooth light curve . on the other hand , since an x - ray light curve has short - duration , rapidly decaying pulses , we see less of a superposition effect than we do in the optical case . in figure  1b , we chose @xmath86  ev with other fiducial parameters .",
    "one can see that the peak flux ratio is @xmath87 , which is roughly consistent with the observation .",
    "( iii )  in the intermediate case @xmath88 , we can see optical pulses synchronizing with the x - ray/@xmath0-ray pulses overlaid by a smooth component . in figure  1c , we chose @xmath89  ev with other fiducial parameters .",
    "( iv )  in the case of @xmath80 , our model can also reproduce bright optical flash associated with e.g. , grb  990123 . in figure  1d , we chose @xmath90  cm , @xmath51  ev , and @xmath91  ev with other fiducial parameters . since @xmath92  kev , the spectrum at @xmath93 enters into the regime @xmath94 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectrum ] ) , resulting in the smaller observed x - ray flux @xmath95 compared with cases ( i)(iii ) .",
    "then the large value of observed @xmath96 can be reproduced .",
    "our result implies that external reverse shock emission is not necessarily required .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed a synchrotron - inverse compton model to explain simultaneously the optical flash and the @xmath0-ray behavior of grb  990123 , which is similar claim as ours .",
    "note that since @xmath51  ev , an additional band function component is necessary in order to match the observed spectrum in the range @xmath97 .",
    "such a correction can be possible without changing the value of @xmath98 .",
    "( v )  finally , if @xmath99 , then the observed flux in the optical band becomes dim because of the steep slope below @xmath35 via the synchrotron self - absorption .",
    "in this letter , assuming the synchrotron radiation with the absorption frequency @xmath35 around the r - band frequency @xmath59 , we have shown that the observed diversity of the prompt optical emission arises when @xmath35 varies and that our theoretical model explains the observation well . at present , the broad - band spectrum of the prompt emission of the grb is unknown , and several possibilities have been proposed ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "our discussion can be generalized for such cases .",
    "if the comoving spectral function , @xmath37 , has the following form around a break frequency @xmath100 , @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 , then , our conclusion derived in this letter remains unchanged qualitatively .",
    "our model will be tested by observing the spectral energy index , @xmath104 , in the optical band .",
    "when the optical light curve synchronizes with the x - ray/@xmath0-rays ( i.e. , @xmath105 ) , then the optical band is above the break frequency , @xmath106 , so that the energy index is @xmath107 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the optical light curve is rather smooth and does not synchronize with the x - ray/@xmath0-rays light curves , then the optical band is below @xmath106 ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath109 is expected .",
    "therefore , multicolor observation in the optical ( and/or infrared ) band is important to test our model .",
    "we would like to thank the anonymous referee and k.  ioka for useful comments .",
