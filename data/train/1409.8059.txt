    "<S> we study the associated production of an electroweak vector boson and the higgs boson with a jet via gluon - gluon fusion . at the leading order </S>",
    "<S> , these processes occur at one - loop level . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitudes of these one - loop processes are gauge invariant and finite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , their contributions towards the corresponding hadronic cross sections and kinematic distributions can be calculated separately . </S>",
    "<S> we present results for the large hadron collider and its discussed upgrades . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the gluon - gluon one - loop process gives dominant contribution to the @xmath0 production . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a destructive interference effect in the @xmath1 amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that in the high transverse momentum and central rapidity region , the @xmath2 production cross section via gluon - gluon fusion becomes comparable to the cross section contributions coming from quark - quark and quark - gluon channels .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs numbers : 12.38-t , 12.38.bx , 13.85.lg + keywords : lhc , gluon fusion , higgs , one - loop    recapp - hri-2014 - 020    with the discovery of the higgs boson @xcite at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , the standard model and its symmetry - breaking mechanism have been validated . </S>",
    "<S> the cms and atlas collaborations are measuring its properties.the higgs boson was discovered through @xmath3 production mechanism . since then signals of other production mechanisms have also been examined . in particular , the associated production of the higgs boson with an electroweak boson has been explored @xcite . to ensure that the discovered higgs boson is indeed the standard model higgs boson , </S>",
    "<S> there is a need to detect as many of its signatures as possible . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , since there is no signal that points to new physics beyond the standard model , there is a need to look for standard model processes that do not have large but accessible cross sections , and can be enhanced / modified by new physics effects .    </S>",
    "<S> the lhc and its proposed upgrades provide us an opportunity to explore two types of processes in more details : a ) the processes which , in the standard model , begin at the one - loop level ( one - loop being the leading order ( lo ) ) ; b ) gluon - gluon scattering processes . as the centre - of - mass energy increases , the gluon - gluon luminosity increases , making many more processes observable . </S>",
    "<S> study of such relatively rare processes is complementary to new physics searches at high energy colliders . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the lhc provides a unique opportunity for testing many of the standard model predictions which was not possible at earlier high energy colliders . for example , many one - loop gluon - gluon fusion processes are / will be accessible only at the lhc  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these gluon fusion one - loop processes can be studied both in the signal and background categories .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we are interested in the gluon - gluon contribution to the @xmath4 hadronic processes , i.e. , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an electroweak vector boson and ` _ j _ ' stands for a light - quark , or gluon initiated jet . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of the process @xmath7 is trivially zero due to the electromagnetic charge conservation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath6 would refer to a photon or a @xmath8 boson . </S>",
    "<S> this process occurs at the one - loop via triangle , box , and pentagon diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> since quarks carry both the electroweak and color charges , the leading order contribution comes from quark - loop diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> the prototype quark - loop diagrams are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : vhj ]  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( we have not displayed some of the triangle and bubble diagrams which do not contribute due to the vanishing color factor . ) for the @xmath9 case , only pentagon class of diagrams contribute . </S>",
    "<S> the box diagrams with @xmath10 coupling do not contribute because of the furry s theorem . </S>",
    "<S> due to the same reason , the leading order @xmath11 amplitude vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> there are a total 24 pentagon diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to charge conjugation symmetry only 12 of those are independent . </S>",
    "<S> the full amplitude is proportional to the symmetric color factor @xmath12 </S>",
    "<S> .     processes . </S>",
    "<S> the complete set of diagrams can be generated by permuting the external legs . </S>",
    "<S> the leading order @xmath13 amplitude receives contribution only from the pentagon diagrams.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    in the @xmath2 case , box and triangle diagrams also contribute . </S>",
    "<S> once again there are 12 independent pentagon ( pen ) diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> there are two types of box diagrams depending on the nature of the higgs coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the number of independent box diagrams with @xmath14 coupling ( bx2 ) is 3 . because of the nonsymmetric color factors , in the case of pen and bx2 amplitudes both the vector and axial - vector pieces of the @xmath8 boson coupling with quarks contribute . in the case of box diagrams with @xmath10 coupling ( bx1 ) , there are 9 ( @xmath15 ) independent diagrams due to self gluon coupling.there are also 3 independent triangle ( tr ) diagrams . in the case of bx1 and tr diagrams , contribution of the vector part of the @xmath16 coupling vanishes due to the furry s theorem . </S>",
    "<S> the vector and axial - vector parts of the full amplitude are proportional to the symmetric color factor @xmath12 and antisymmetric color factor @xmath17 respectively . except the top quark </S>",
    "<S> , all other quarks in the loop are treated massless . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the diagrams involving @xmath10 coupling , we take only the top quark contribution . </S>",
    "<S> since the axial - vector part of the amplitude is proportional to the isospin quantum number @xmath18 , only third generation quarks ( which have large mass difference ) give contribution . </S>",
    "<S> the triangle and box diagrams involving @xmath14 coupling are anomalous , therefore both the top and bottom quark contributions are taken . </S>",
    "<S> we ignore the contribution of the top quark loop of the bx2 diagrams in the case of vector @xmath19 coupling due to its large mass and no compensating factor from the couplings .    </S>",
    "<S> the amplitudes of the gluon fusion processes under consideration have following structure :    @xmath20    where the subscripts ` v ' and ` av ' stand for the vector and axial - vector parts of the amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> since the vector and axial - vector parts of the amplitude have symmetric and antisymmetric color factors , they do not interfere at the amplitude - squared level . </S>",
    "<S> note that the leading order gluon fusion process @xmath21 contributes to the corresponding hadronic process at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in strong coupling parameter @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> it also contributes to the qcd next - to - leading order ( nlo ) correction of @xmath23  @xcite .    to calculate this amplitude , </S>",
    "<S> we follow a semi - numerical approach . as a first step , the traces of gamma - matrices in the prototype diagrams are calculated using form  @xcite in @xmath24 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> this demands an implementation of a suitable @xmath25dimensional prescription for @xmath26 in form . </S>",
    "<S> the gamma - matrices traces involving @xmath26 can also be calculated in four dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> this will lead to spurious / anomalous terms in amplitudes suffering from chiral anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that such anomalous terms contribute to the quark mass independent rational piece of the amplitude  @xcite . since the standard model is free from anomaly , </S>",
    "<S> the spurious terms are expected to get canceled between the up - type and down - type quark contributions of a given quark generation . since </S>",
    "<S> all the gamma - matrices in the trace are contracted either with the momenta or polarizations , the trace calculation does not lead to any explicit @xmath24 dependence . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude at this stage can be cast in terms of tensor integrals . </S>",
    "<S> it has rank - four , five - point functions as the most complicated tensor integrals . in standard notations , a rank - four </S>",
    "<S> , five - point tensor integral can be written as , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the loop momentum , @xmath24 is the space - time dimension and @xmath29 s are loop momentum dependent scalar propagators . </S>",
    "<S> the tensor integrals are known to be expressible in terms of scalar integrals  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is the most important part of any multileg one - loop computation . </S>",
    "<S> we reduce pentagon tensor integrals into box tensor and scalar integrals using the fact that in four dimensions the loop momentum ( @xmath28 ) can be expressed as a linear combination of four independent external momenta which are available in a five - point ( @xmath30 ) process . </S>",
    "<S> the same fact is used to write a pentagon scalar integral in terms of five box scalar integrals  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the pentagon tensor integrals are ultraviolet ( uv ) finite , their reduction into box tensor and scalar integrals can be carried out in four dimensions consistently  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we follow the methods of oldenborgh and vermaseren ( ov ) @xcite to reduce the box and lower - point tensor integrals . </S>",
    "<S> this part of the reduction is performed in @xmath31 dimensions to regulate the bad ultraviolet behaviour of tensor integrals . in ov method </S>",
    "<S> , the organization of tensor integrals in terms of generalized kronecker deltas promises a greater numerical stability of the reduction procedure . </S>",
    "<S> the complete one - loop tensor reduction library , ovreduce , is developed ( in fortran ) to carry out the numerical reduction of one - loop tensor integrals required in @xmath30 processes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the singular structure of any one - loop amplitude is , thus , encoded in various scalar integrals of box , triangle , bubble and tadpole types . </S>",
    "<S> we use oneloop library  @xcite to compute all the required scalar integrals . </S>",
    "<S> it uses dimensional regularization to regulate both the uv and infrared ( ir ) singularities . </S>",
    "<S> we require only one prototype pentagon and bx2 amplitudes to generate the vector part of the full amplitude . on the other hand , to generate the full axial - vector part of the amplitude , we require three prototype pentagon amplitudes , three bx1 amplitudes , one bx2 amplitude and one tr amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> this is to ensure that permutation of momenta and polarizations is consistent with the permutation of external legs and their couplings with the massive quarks .    </S>",
    "<S> we perform many checks to ensure the correctness of the @xmath32 amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitudes are expected to be both ultraviolet and infrared ( due to massless quarks ) finite . </S>",
    "<S> this is an important check on the amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> the ir finiteness holds for each quark loop diagram  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the uv finiteness is expected only in gauge invariant subamplitudes , however , there are amplitudes which are individually uv finite from naive power counting . </S>",
    "<S> for example , each pentagon amplitude and each axial - vector part of bx1 , bx2 and tr amplitudes are uv finite . as an ultimate check , </S>",
    "<S> we have checked the gauge invariance of amplitudes with respect to all the gauge currents . </S>",
    "<S> we do it numerically by replacing their polarization vectors with their respective 4-momenta , @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the vector part of the amplitude is gauge invariant with respect to the @xmath8 boson . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to the explicit breaking of the chiral symmetry in presence of massive quarks , the axial - vector part of the amplitude is not gauge invariant with respect to the @xmath8 boson . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked explicitly that the quantum anomaly is canceled between the top and bottom quark contributions . </S>",
    "<S> the three - body phase space is generated using the phase space generator rambo  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> because of a very large and complicated expression of the amplitudes , we calculate the ( helicity/ polarized ) amplitudes before squaring them . the parton level phase space integration and convolution of partonic cross section with the gluon distribution functions are done using the monte - carlo integration method based on vegas  @xcite . to minimize the computation time </S>",
    "<S> , we perform the evaluation in a parallel environment with the help of the amci package  @xcite based on the pvm  @xcite parallel networking software . </S>",
    "<S> the computation of multileg , one - loop amplitudes often suffers from the issue of numerical instability due to the small gram determinants for certain phase space points . </S>",
    "<S> since the number of such phase space points is not very large , we systematically ignore their contribution by implementing a set of ward - identities . </S>",
    "<S> more details on this can be found in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> .a comparison of parton channels contributing to @xmath34 hadronic cross section.the numbers in bracket in 100 tev column are with a minimum @xmath35 cut of 50 gev . [ </S>",
    "<S> cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      boson . </S>",
    "<S> , title=\"fig : \" ]   boson . </S>",
    "<S> , title=\"fig : \" ]    in figure  [ fig : distj - gzh ] , the @xmath36 and rapidity distributions for the jet is shown . </S>",
    "<S> since the final state gluon can originate as radiation from the initial state gluons ( as in bx1 and tr diagrams ) , the majority of events come from low @xmath36 region of the jet . </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated the @xmath37 hadronic cross section at 8 , 13 , 14 , 33 and 100 tev collider centre - of - mass energies . in going from 8 tev to 14 tev , the cross section increases by about a factor of 5 due to an increase in the gluon flux at a higher energy . in table  </S>",
    "<S> [ table : xs - gzh ] , we have compared the gluon - gluon ( gg ) contribution to @xmath38 with the lo and nlo quark - quark ( qq ) and quark - gluon ( qg ) predictions at various collider centre - of - mass energies.the nlo correction to this process has been computed in recent past  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained the nlo results using mg5_amc@nlo  @xcite with cteq6 m parton distributions . as expected </S>",
    "<S> , the relative importance of the gg contribution increases with the increasing collider energy . to illustrate this , </S>",
    "<S> we have displayed two ratios @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the table . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio @xmath41 suggests that even at 8 tev , the gg contribution becomes comparable to the nlo _ enhancement _ of qq+qg contribution . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the net contribution from the qq+qg channel remains dominant at all energies . in the 14 tev column , </S>",
    "<S> the numbers are presented with the percentage scale uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> for that we have varied the scale by a factor of 2 about the central value @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> a large scale uncertainty in the gg predictions is typical to many other gluon - gluon fusion processes which can be reduced by including the higher order corrections . </S>",
    "<S> one example of such a process is @xmath43 which has been widely studied in the literature  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the gg numbers for 100 tev should be interpreted carefully . in the last row of the table , we also report @xmath44 hadronic cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> note that , the @xmath37 cross section exceeds @xmath45 cross section at @xmath46100 tev for a minimum @xmath35 cut of 30 gev . </S>",
    "<S> this is a reflection of the fact that at such high energies , the cross section is also influenced by the large - log terms like @xmath47 . due to this </S>",
    "<S> , the fixed - order perturbative cross section prediction can not be reliable below certain @xmath36 and one needs to resum these large logarithms . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the table , we have also reported the cross section at 100 tev with @xmath48 gev .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also compared the normalized @xmath36 and rapidity distributions of the @xmath8 boson at lo(gg ) and nlo(qq+qg ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown in figure  [ fig : ptz - gg - vs - qq ] . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the two contributions is consistent with the fact that at higher @xmath36 , the region of parton distributions with smaller momentum fraction @xmath49 is easily accessible and gluon distributions are more important in this region . </S>",
    "<S> this comparison suggests that at high @xmath36 and low rapidity the gg contribution is relatively more important along with the dominant qq+qg channel contribution . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath36 and rapidity distributions of the higgs also show a similar characteristic difference , however , the same is not true for the distributions of the jet .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied the gluon - gluon fusion contribution to the @xmath50 process , where @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> it is a nnlo contribution in @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the hadronic cross section for @xmath0 is only about 0.3 fb at 14 tev lhc , however , it is much larger than the leading order quark - quark and quark - gluon contribution which is only about 0.01 fb at 14 tev . </S>",
    "<S> this raises the possibility of observing the production of the higgs boson in association with a photon with sufficient integrated luminosity at the lhc . in the @xmath2 case , </S>",
    "<S> apart from the gg fusion contribution , we have used mg5_amc@nlo to estimate the nlo corrections to the qq+qg contribution . </S>",
    "<S> we find that at 13 or 14 tev centre of mass energy , the gluon - gluon contribution is comparable to the nlo corrections . at higher centre - of - mass energies </S>",
    "<S> , the gg contribution becomes even more important and can become comparable to the qq+qg contributions . in the @xmath2 case </S>",
    "<S> , we also observe a destructive interference between the two gauge invariant sets of amplitudes involving @xmath52 and @xmath14 couplings . </S>",
    "<S> any modification to these couplings due to new physics effects can spoil the interference effect and lead to a very different prediction . </S>",
    "<S> a suitable @xmath36 and rapidity cuts can be employed to enhance the signal from this channel while comparing it with quark - quark and quark - gluon channels . for realistic predictions the parton shower effects </S>",
    "<S> should also be included which is beyond the scope of the present work . like many other gluon - gluon fusion lo processes </S>",
    "<S> , the processes considered here too suffer from a large scale uncertainty . by computing higher order qcd corrections </S>",
    "<S> , the scale uncertainty can be reduced . </S>",
    "<S> however , this will be quite challenging at the nlo as it requires evaluation of one - loop six - point functions and two - loop five - point functions . </S>"
