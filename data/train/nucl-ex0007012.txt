    "neutrinoless double beta ( 0@xmath192@xmath2 ) decay is forbidden in the standard model ( sm ) since it violates lepton number ( @xmath20 ) conservation .",
    "however many extensions of the sm incorporate @xmath20 violating interactions and thus could lead to 0@xmath192@xmath2 decay @xcite .",
    "currently , besides the conventional left - handed neutrino ( @xmath19 ) exchange mechanism , there are many other possibilities to trigger this process @xcite : right - handed @xmath19 exchange in left - right symmetric models ; exchange of squarks , sneutrinos , etc . via supersymmetric ( susy ) interactions ; exchange of leptoquarks in models with leptoquarks ;",
    "exchange of excited majorana neutrinos in models with composite heavy neutrinos , and so on . in that sense 0@xmath192@xmath2 decay has a great conceptual importance due to the strong statement obtained in a gauge theory of the weak interaction that a non - vanishing 0@xmath192@xmath2 decay rate requires neutrinos to be massive majorana particles , independently of which mechanism induces it @xcite .",
    "therefore , at present 0@xmath192@xmath2 decay is considered as a powerful method to test new physical effects beyond the sm , while absence of this process ",
    "established at the present level of sensitivity  would yield strong restrictions on parameters of manifold extensions of the sm and narrow the wide choice of the theoretical models . at the same time 0@xmath192@xmath2 decay is very important in light of the current status of neutrino physics ( see @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the solar neutrino problem ( in particular lack of @xmath21be neutrinos ) and the deficit of the atmospheric muon neutrino flux @xcite could be explained by means of neutrino oscillations , which require nonzero neutrino masses . also indication for @xmath22/@xmath23 oscillations was found by the lsnd collaboration @xcite .",
    "oscillation experiments are only sensitive to neutrino mass difference , while measuring the 0@xmath192@xmath2 decay rate can give the absolute value of the @xmath19 mass scale , and hence provide a crucial test of neutrino mass models .    despite the numerous efforts to observe 0@xmath192@xmath2 decay beginning from 1948 up to the present @xcite this process still remains unobserved .",
    "the highest half - life limits were set in direct experiments with several nuclides : @xmath24(0@xmath25 yr for @xmath7se @xcite , @xmath0mo @xcite ; @xmath24(0@xmath26 yr for @xmath1cd @xcite , @xmath27te",

    "we consider in the present paper the use of the super - low background liquid scintillation detector  the borexino counting test facility ( ctf ) @xcite  for high sensitivity 2@xmath2 decay research .",
    "the full description of the ctf and its performance have been published elsewhere @xcite . here",
    "we recall the main features of this apparatus , which are important in the following .",
    "the ctf is installed in the gran sasso underground laboratory and consists of an external cylindrical water tank ( @xmath3411@xmath3510 m ; @xmath91000 t of water ) serving as passive shielding for 4.8 m@xmath36 of liquid scintillator contained in an inner spherical vessel of @xmath342.1 m. high purity water is supplied by the borexino water plant , which provides its radio - purity level of @xmath37 g / g ( u , th ) , @xmath38 g / g ( k natural ) and @xmath395 @xmath40bq/_l _ for @xmath41rn @xcite .",
    "the liquid scintillator is a binary solution of 1.5 g/_l _ of ppo in pseudocumene .",
    "the fluorescence peak emission is at 365 nm and the yield of emitted photons is @xmath910@xmath42 per mev of energy deposited .",
    "the attenuation length is larger than @xmath43 m above 380 nm @xcite . the principal scintillator decay time was measured as @xmath93.5 ns in a small volume , while as 4.55.0 ns with a source placed in the center of the ctf .",
    "the scintillator is purified by recirculating it from the inner vessel through a rn stripping tower , a water extraction unit , a si - gel column extraction unit , and a vacuum distillation unit .",
    "it ensures that @xmath44th and @xmath45u contaminations in the liquid scintillator are less than @xmath46@xmath47 g / g .    the inner vessel for the liquid scintillator is made of nylon film , 500 @xmath48 m thick , with excellent optical clarity at 350 - 500 nm , which allows collection of scintillation light with the help of 100 phototubes ( pmt ) fixed to a 7 m diameter support structure inside the water tank .",
    "the pmts are 8  thorn emi 9351 tubes made of low radioactivity schott 8246 glass , and characterized by high quantum efficiency ( 26% at 420 nm ) , limited transit time spread ( @xmath49 = @xmath50 ns ) , good pulse height resolution for single photoelectron pulses ( peak / valley = @xmath51 ) , low dark noise rate ( 0.5 khz ) , low after pulse probability ( 2.5% ) , and a gain of 10@xmath21 .",
    "the pmts are fitted with light concentrators 57 cm long and 50 cm diameter aperture .",
    "they provide 20% optical coverage .",
    "the number of photoelectrons per mev measured experimentally is ( 300 @xmath52 30)/mev on average .",
    "an upgrade of the ctf was realized in 1999 when an additional nylon barrier against radon convection and a muon veto system were installed .    for each event",
    "the charge and timing ( precision of 1 ns ) of hit pmts are recorded .",
    "each channel is doubled by an auxiliary channel to record all other events coming within a time window of 8 ms after the first event . for longer delay the computer clock",
    "is used ( accuracy of @xmath90.1 s ) .",
    "event parameters measured in the ctf include :    - the total charge collected by the pmts during @xmath53@xmath54 ns ( event energy ) ;    - the tail charge ( @xmath55@xmath56 ns ) used for pulse shape discrimination ;    - pmt timing to reconstruct the event in space ( resolution of 1015 cm ) ;    - the time elapsed between sequential events , used to tag time - correlated events .",
    "due to all these measures the ctf is the best super - low background scintillator of large volume at present .",
    "indeed , the total background rate in the energy region 250  800 kev ( so called  solar neutrino energy window  ) is about 0.3 counts / yr@xmath4kev@xmath4 kg and is dominated by external background from rn in the shielding water ( @xmath930 mbq / m@xmath36 in the region surrounding the inner vessel ) , while the internal background is less than 0.01 counts / yr@xmath4kev@xmath4 kg .",
    "therefore one can conclude that the ctf is the ideal apparatus for super - low background 2@xmath2 decay research .    for the choice of 2@xmath2 candidate nuclei",
    "let us express the @xmath57 decay probability ( neglecting right - handed contributions ) as follows @xcite :    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the nuclear matrix element of the @xmath57 decay , and @xmath60 is the phase space factor . ignoring for the moment the @xmath59 calculation @xcite , it is evident from eq .",
    "( 1 ) that for the sensitivity of the @xmath61 decay study with a particular candidate the most important parameter is the available energy release ( @xmath62 ) . first , because the phase space integral ( hence , @xmath57 decay rate ) strongly depends on @xmath62 value ( roughly as @xmath63 ) .",
    "second , the larger the @xmath61 decay energy , the simpler  from an experimental point of view  to overcome background problems .",
    "the crucial value is 2614 kev which is the energy of the most dangerous @xmath64 s from @xmath65tl decay ( @xmath44th family ) . among 35 candidates",
    "there are only six nuclei with @xmath62 larger than 2.6 mev @xcite : @xmath66ca ( @xmath67 @xmath68 kev , natural abundance @xmath69 ) , @xmath7se ( @xmath62 @xmath70 kev , @xmath71 ) , @xmath72zr ( @xmath73 @xmath74 kev , @xmath75 ) , @xmath0mo ( @xmath62 @xmath76 kev , @xmath77 ) , @xmath1cd ( @xmath62 @xmath78 kev , @xmath79 ) , and @xmath8nd ( @xmath62 @xmath80 kev , @xmath81 ) .",
    "the values of the phase space integral @xmath82 for these candidates are ( in units 10@xmath83 yr ) : 6.4 ( @xmath66ca ) , 2.8 ( @xmath7se ) , 5.7 ( @xmath72zr ) , 4.6 ( @xmath0mo ) , 4.9 ( @xmath1cd ) , and @xmath920 ( @xmath84nd ) @xcite . in comparison ,",
    "@xmath82 for @xmath31ge is equal @xmath90.6 ( in the same units ) because of the lower @xmath61 decay energy ( @xmath62 @xmath85 kev ) . from this list @xmath0mo and @xmath13cd",
    "were chosen as candidates for @xmath61 decay study with the ctf in the first phase .",
    "the main reason for the choice of @xmath0mo  in addition to its high @xmath62 value  is the fact that the institute for nuclear research ( kiev ) possesses @xmath91 kg of @xmath0mo enriched to @xmath999% .",
    "the @xmath1cd was chosen because during the last decade the inr ( kiev ) has developed and performed @xmath61 decay experiments with this nuclide @xcite , which can be considered as a pilot step for the proposed project with the ctf .",
    "there are two different classes of @xmath61 decay experiments : ( a ) an  active  source experiment , in which the detector ( containing @xmath61 candidate nuclei ) serves as source and detector simultaneously ; ( b ) an experiment with ",
    "passive  source which is introduced in the detector system @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of any @xmath61 decay apparatus is determined first , by the available source strengths ( mass of the source ) , and second , by the detector background .",
    "another factor very essential for determining the sensitivity is the energy resolution of the detector .",
    "indeed , for a detector with poor energy resolution the events from the high energy tail of the @xmath86 decay distribution run into the energy window of the @xmath57 decay peak , and therefore generate background which can not be discriminated from the @xmath57 decay signal , even in principle .",
    "all of the decay features are similar : the same two particles are emitted simultaneously from one point of the source , in the same energy region and with identical angular distribution . however , the better the energy resolution ",
    "the smaller the @xmath87 tail becomes within the @xmath88 interval , and thus the irreducible background becomes lower .",
    "hence , we can conclude that the ultimate sensitivity to detect @xmath57 decay is really limited by the energy resolution of the detector , which is the most crucial parameter for any kind of set up for @xmath61 decay study .",
    "for the second class of experiments the sensitivity is also restricted by the trade - off between source strengths and detection efficiency .",
    "the number of @xmath61 decay candidate nuclei can be enlarged by increasing the source thickness , which at the same time will lead to lower detection efficiency caused by absorption of electrons in the source and transformation of the measured @xmath61 decay spectra ( broadening of the peak and shifting it to lower energies ) .",
    "these experimental considerations are illustrated in fig .",
    "1 , where results of model experiments to study @xmath61 decay of @xmath0mo are presented .",
    "the following assumptions were accepted for simulation : mass of @xmath0mo source is 1 kg ( @xmath96@xmath89 nuclei of @xmath0mo ) ; measuring time is 5 years ; half - life of @xmath0mo two neutrino @xmath61 decay @xmath90(2@xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 yr ( e.g. see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , while for 0@xmath19 mode @xmath24(0@xmath91 = @xmath94 yr . the simulations were performed with the geant3.21 package @xcite and event generator decay4 @xcite , which describes the initial kinematics of the events in @xmath95 , @xmath2 , and 2@xmath2 decay ( how many particles are emitted , their types , energies , directions and times of emission ) .",
    "the initial @xmath61 decay spectra are shown in fig .",
    "1a and fig .",
    "1b for different vertical scales .",
    "these spectra simulate @xmath96 decay of @xmath0mo nuclei placed in an ideal detector (  active  source technique ) with 100% efficiency for @xmath61 decay events and with zero background ( energy resolution and energy threshold of 10 kev are presumed ) . for the next step",
    "the @xmath0mo source was introduced in the same detector as a foil (  passive  source technique ) .",
    "the simulated spectra are depicted in fig .",
    "1c ( thickness of @xmath0mo foil is 15 mg/@xmath97 ) and fig .",
    "1d ( 60 mg/@xmath97 ) .",
    "finally the energy resolution of the detector ( @xmath98 ) was taken into account and results are shown in fig .",
    "1e ( @xmath98 = 4% at 3 mev ) and fig .",
    "1f ( @xmath98 = 8.8% at 3 mev ) .",
    "it should be stressed that fig .",
    "1 represents the results of an ideal experiment , while in any real study the available results can only be worse by reason of the actual background , higher energy threshold and lower detection efficiency , etc .",
    "in fact , this is very strong statement because it allows to set the sensitivity limit for any real apparatus .",
    "for instance , it is evident from fig . 1f",
    "that 0@xmath99 decay of @xmath0mo with half - life @xmath24 = @xmath94 yr will hardly be observed by using the  passive  source technique with the following characteristics : ( i ) product of detection efficiency by number of @xmath0mo nuclei @xmath96@xmath89 ( e.g. , 1 kg of @xmath0mo at 100% efficiency , or 10 kg of @xmath0mo at 10% efficiency ) ; ( ii ) @xmath0mo source thickness of 60 mg/@xmath97 ; ( iii ) @xmath98 = 8.8% at 3 mev . at the same time",
    ", it is obvious from fig . 1e",
    "that such a goal can be reached with similar apparatus with @xmath98 = 4% at 3 mev , and with a 15 mg/@xmath100 source .",
    "the last solution requires an increase of source area , which is usually limited by the available dimensions of the low background detectors used for @xmath101 decay search .",
    "however , the unique features of the ctf  large sensitive volume and super - low background rate of the detector  permit an advanced @xmath61 decay study of @xmath6mo with the help of large square ( @xmath97 m@xmath102 ) and thin @xmath0mo foil placed inside the liquid scintillator .",
    "the @xmath0mo source in the ctf is a complex system placed in the inner vessel with liquid scintillator .",
    "it can be represented by three mutually perpendicular and crossing flat disks with diameter of 180 cm whose centers are aligned with the center of inner vessel of the ctf .",
    "each disk is composed of three layers : inner @xmath0mo sourcemo source itself consists of four sectors with spacing between them of 12 cm , which helps in spatial reconstruction when events occur near the crossing of the disks . ]",
    "( thickness of @xmath915 mg/@xmath97 ) placed between two plastic scintillators of 1 mm thickness .",
    "the inner side of each plastic is coated with thin al foil serving as light reflector , while the whole source ",
    "sandwich  must be encapsulated by thin transparent film ( made of teflon or syndiotactic polypropylene ) to avoid plastic dissolution in liquid scintillator .",
    "plastic detectors can have a much longer decay constant ( f.e . as bicron plastic bc-444 with @xmath103 ns and light output @xmath940% of anthracene ) with respect to the liquid scintillator , thus their pulses can be discriminated easily from the liquid scintillator signals .",
    "the plastics tag electrons emitted from the @xmath0mo source , reducing the background of this complex detector system significantly .",
    "the energy loss measured by the plastics are added to the electron energy deposit in the liquid scintillator to obtain an accurate value of the electron energy and to improve the energy resolution of the whole detector .",
    "the energy resolution of the scintillation detector depends mainly on the quality of scintillator itself , the fraction of light collected by pmts , uniformity of light collection , quantum efficiency and noise of the pmt photocathodes , stability and noise of the electronics .",
    "the excellent liquid scintillator used in the ctf yields about 10@xmath42 emitted photons per mev of energy deposited . in the present ctf design the actual optical coverage is 20% and the number of photoelectrons ( p.e . ) per mev measured experimentally is ( 300 @xmath52 30)/mev on average .",
    "thus with fourfold increase of light collection it would yield @xmath91200 p.e .",
    "per 1 mev or @xmath93600 p.e . for 3 mev .    to increase the actual optical coverage in the ctf",
    ", the pmts can be mounted closer to the center of the detector .",
    "for instance , if 200 pmts are fixed at diameter 5 m ( and correspondingly the light concentrators entrances at diameter 4 m ) , or 96 pmts are fixed at diameter 3.8 m , the optical coverage is equal @xmath980% .",
    "we consider below the last configuration because it is the worst case for background contribution from the pmts .",
    "since the whole volume of the scintillator is divided by @xmath0mo sources into 8 sectors , the pmts are split into 8 groups of 12 pmts each , so that one sector is viewed by one pmt group . within the single sector ( three mutually perpendicular reflector plates )",
    "scintillation photons would undergo less than 1.5 reflections on average before reaching the light concentrator aperture .",
    "the monte carlo simulation of the light propagation in such a geometry were performed with the help of geant3.21 program @xcite .",
    "the emission spectrum and angular distribution of scintillation photons were added to geant code .",
    "the simulation finds that 3 mev energy deposit would yield @xmath93700 photoelectrons allowing a measurement of the neutrinoless @xmath61 decay peak of @xmath6mo ( @xmath62 @xmath104 kev ) with an energy resolution @xmath98 = 4% .",
    "this goal can be reached if the non - uniformity of light collection is corrected by using accurate spatial information about each event ; hence , the spatial reconstruction ability of the ctf has to be enhanced also .",
    "the results of the monte carlo simulation prove such a possibility and show that spatial resolution of @xmath956 cm can be obtained with the upgraded ctf .",
    "primarily this is due to better light collection ( increased by a factor of four ) .",
    "secondly , it is owing to the spatial reconstruction method based on the comparison of pulse amplitudes from the different pmts ( within one group of 12 pmts ) , and at the same time due to analysis of the time structure of each pulse ( which can include direct and reflected light ) .",
    "the model of the cameo - i set up with @xmath6mo ( described above ) is used for the calculations .",
    "we distinguish here between so called ",
    "layers of the liquid scintillator , 15 cm thick ",
    "layers are separated from the total volume of the liquid scintillator by using the spatial information from the ctf .",
    "the thickness of 15 cm is chosen to guarantee the proper spatial reconstruction accuracy and the full absorption of the electrons emitted in the 2@xmath2 decay of @xmath6mo . ] on both sides of the complex @xmath0mo source , and the rest of the liquid scintillator volume serving as an active shield for these main inner layers .",
    "in such a detector system the following energies are measured :    \\i ) @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the energy losses in the first and second plastic ;    \\ii ) @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the energy deposits in the first and second  @xmath2  layer ;    \\iii ) @xmath109 is the energy loss in the liquid scintillator active shield .",
    "the energy threshold values of the detectors are set as @xmath110= 15 kev for the plastic and @xmath111 = @xmath112 = 10 kev for the liquid scintillator .",
    "the energy resolution is @xmath113 for the plastic and @xmath114 for the liquid scintillator ( @xmath98 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 are in kev ) .",
    "the latter corresponds to the value of 4% at 3 mev .",

    "hence , it is evident from the last equation that neglecting the complicated problem of nuclear matrix elements calculation , the cameo - iii experiment will bring at least the same restriction on the neutrino mass as the genius project . indeed , on the basis of the cameo half - life limit @xmath182 @xmath119 10@xmath326 yr and using calculations @xcite one can derive a limit on the neutrino mass of @xmath330 ev at 90% c.l .",
