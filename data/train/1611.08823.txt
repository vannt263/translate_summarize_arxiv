    "it is safe to say that elastic composite materials are of huge technological importance .",
    "this statement is backed by the fact that concrete , the most abundant man - made material on earth @xcite , is frequently composed of a cement matrix supported by more rigid particulate inclusions @xcite .",
    "understanding the mutual interactions between the inclusions as well as between the inclusions and the matrix is crucial to understand the overall material performance .",
    "while hardened concrete is a relatively rigid substance , polymeric gel matrices or biological tissue can provide softer elastic environments . then",
    ", larger - scale displacements and rotations of embedded inclusions can be observed when forces and/or torques are externally imposed or induced .",
    "magnetic microrheology observes the displacements of probe particles caused by externally applied magnetic field gradients @xcite . for instance , the mechanical response of the cytoskeleton @xcite was analyzed in this way .",
    "similarly , the rotational motion of magnetic rods under externally imposed magnetic torques can be used for microrheological purposes @xcite .",
    "the same is true for tracking the relative displacements between particles that respond to mutual magnetic forces induced between them @xcite .",
    "thinking of rigid inclusions embedded in a soft elastic polymeric gel matrix , artificial soft actuators represent a natural type of application @xcite .",
    "different approaches are possible . on the one hand , a net external force or torque can be imposed onto the inclusions .",
    "for example , magnetic particles are drawn towards external field gradients @xcite , while anisotropic particles may experience a torque under an external electric or magnetic field @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the externally imposed forces or torques are transmitted by the inclusions to the embedding matrix and lead to overall deformations . on the other hand , genuinely electrostrictive or magnetostrictive effects can be exploited when external electric or magnetic fields induce mutual attractions and repulsions between the embedded inclusions and in total lead to macroscopic deformations @xcite .",
    "in addition to that , the overall mechanical properties can be tuned from outside by external fields in such materials .",
    "this allows , during application , to reversibly adjust from outside the elastic properties to a current need .",
    "examples are the magnitudes of the elastic moduli @xcite , nonlinear stress - strain behavior @xcite , or dynamic properties @xcite , allowing for instance for the construction of tunable soft damping devices @xcite .    in all these situations , for a theoretical characterization and quantitative description of the material behavior ,",
    "it is necessary to determine the induced displacements and rotations of the rigid inclusions .",
    "this is a coupled many - body problem .",
    "the inclusions are enclosed by the elastic matrix and transmit the forces and torques to their embedding environment . as a consequence",
    ", the matrix gets deformed .",
    "the other inclusions are exposed to these induced deformations of their environment . as a consequence",
    ", they are additionally displaced and rotated .",
    "moreover , the inclusions are rigid and resist deformations that would result from the induced matrix deformations .",
    "this resistance leads to further stresses on the embedding matrix and in turn to additional _ matrix - mediated interactions _ between the inclusions .",
    "one can address this problem using simplified representations of the surrounding matrix , e.g. , in elastic - spring @xcite or elastic - rod @xcite models .",
    "alternatively , one can directly perform complete finite - element simulations @xcite or apply related schemes of simulation @xcite to explicitly cover the matrix behavior .    here , for rigid spherical particles embedded with stick boundary conditions in the elastic matrix , we explicitly solve the problem analytically . following the above cause - and - effect principle ,",
    "we start from the forces and torques acting on the embedded particles .",
    "we then calculate the resulting coupled displacements and rotations of all particles , including the described matrix - mediated interactions between them .",
    "our analytical results are given in terms of _ displaceability and rotateability matrices _ that , when multiplied with the forces and torques , lead to the caused displacements and rotations .",
    "these expressions solely depend on the configuration of the inclusions and _ implicitly contain the role of the elastic environment_. as a strong benefit , the deformations of the elastic environment do not need to be calculated explicitly any more .",
    "therefore , in the future , one can directly calculate analytically the resulting displacements and rotations of the inclusions , without needing to resolve the induced elastic matrix deformations any longer .",
    "( to avoid confusion , we note that the term `` matrix '' is used both for the elastic environment as well as for the mathematical representation of second - rank tensors ) .",
    "our approach is based on the fact that for the static linear elasticity equations a green s function is available @xcite .",
    "we then adapt a method from low - reynolds - number hydrodynamics , called the _ method of reflections _ @xcite . there ,",
    "hydrodynamic interactions , i.e.  induced fluid flows for suspended particles , play the role of the matrix - mediated interactions in our case . in hydrodynamics ,",
    "the approach turned out to be extremely successful in characterizing the behavior of suspensions of colloidal particles @xcite , i.e.  nano- to micrometer - sized objects , and of self - propelled microswimmers @xcite .",
    "we expect similar benefits for the characterization of elastic composite materials in the future .",
    "in contrast to the hydrodynamic case , _ compressible _ elastic matrices are readily described as well .",
    "technically , the method corresponds to an iterative procedure in orders of the inverse separation distance between the rigid inclusions .",
    "we here proceed to the fourth order in this inverse distance , but in principle one can proceed to arbitrary order .",
    "parts of our results were presented before ( for instance , the elastic faxn laws @xcite , see below , the derivation of which we here , however , present by explicit calculation in analogy to the hydrodynamic procedure in refs .   and ) .",
    "mostly , in the very few previous approaches on this subject , the displacements were used as a starting point , and expressions for the forces and torques necessary to achieve these displacements were then derived @xcite . here , we follow the converse route , i.e. , the forces and torques are used as known input , and we then calculate the resulting displacements and rotations .",
    "this is in agreement with the cause - and - effect chain that usually applies in experiments .",
    "our presentation has two main purposes .",
    "first , we provide more explicitly the steps of derivation outlined already in ref .   for the displaceability matrix .",
    "second , we amend this procedure by the rotational component , so that now also the influence of imposed torques and the couplings between translational and rotational degrees of freedom are included .",
