    "giant radio galaxies ( grgs , e.g. saripalli et al .",
    "1986 , subrahmanyan et al .",
    "1996 ) are the largest members of the radio galaxy population , with a ( projected ) linear size @xmath13  mpc  km  s@xmath14  mpc@xmath14 and @xmath15 throughout this paper . ] . at low redshift ( @xmath16 ) some thirty of these large sources",
    "are known .",
    "the most extreme case is the radio source 3c236 at a redshift of @xmath17 , which has a projected linear size of 5.7 mpc ( willis et al .",
    "1974 , strom & willis 1980 , barthel et al . 1984 ) .",
    "+ grgs are interesting objects to study .",
    "first , at low redshift their angular size is several arcminutes or larger , which allows detailed studies of the different components of their radio structure , such as their jets ( e.g. ngc6251 , perley et al .",
    "1984 ) and their lobe emission ( e.g. mack et al .",
    "1997a ) using a variety of radio instruments . secondly , because of the large physical size of grgs , they have expanded well out of the denser central regions of the clusters that they reside in , into a much less dense intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "this makes grgs a powerful and unique tool to probe the low - density medium at a large distance from their host galaxies , which is inaccessible to current x - ray instruments .",
    "thirdly , their active galactic nucleus ( agn ) must be approaching the endstage of its radio active phase .",
    "grgs can therefore provide important information on the properties of old agn .",
    "lastly , several of these large sources have been identified with quasars ( e.g. 4c34.47 , jgers et al . 1982 ) or broad line radio galaxies ( e.g. 0319 + 412 , de bruyn 1989 ) .",
    "this makes them important test cases for the orientation dependent unification schemes for radio loud agn ( e.g. barthel 1989 ) .",
    "these state that quasars and radio galaxies are mostly alike , but that quasars have their radio jets oriented closer to the line of sight than radio galaxies . a natural consequence of this is that quasars are not expected to have large projected linear sizes .",
    "+ there are now many indications that the ambient medium of the radio lobes of grgs has a very low density ( @xmath18  @xmath7 ) .",
    "probably the strongest evidence is provided by observations of the rotation measure ( rm ) and the depolarization towards these sources .",
    "the measured rms are small , with values which are usually @xmath19  rad  m@xmath20 ( e.g. klein et al .",
    "1994 , strom & willis 1980 ) .",
    "depolarization occurs only at wavelengths above 10 - 20  cm ( willis & strom 1978 , strom & willis 1980 , jgers 1986 , klein et al .",
    "1996 ) . this combination can only be explained satisfactorily by a very low density of thermal electrons along the line of sight .",
    "+ further indications for a low density environment result from spectral age analyses of grgs .",
    "typical spectral ages for grgs have been found to be @xmath21  yrs ( e.g. mack et al . 1998 ) , which translates into expansion velocities of @xmath22 . using the assumption of ram pressure equilibrium at the head of the jet ( e.g. miley 1980 ) , external densities of @xmath23  @xmath7",
    "are commonly found for grgs .",
    "this method suffers from many assumptions that have to be made , such as equipartition between the energy density of the relativistic particles and the magnetic field , the filling factor of the radio lobes , the fraction of energy in heavy particles , the area of the bow shock , and so on .",
    "it is therefore often criticized ( e.g. eilek et al . 1997 ) and its result should be interpreted with care .",
    "+ many clusters have large and bright x - ray haloes , often extending to distances of more than 1  mpc from their centers and containing cooling flows ( e.g. fabian 1994 ) .",
    "x - ray studies of some grgs ( e.g. ngc  6251 ; mack et al .",
    "1997b ) , however , have found only weak thermal x - ray emission around the host galaxies .",
    "grgs are therefore probably not inside rich clusters with dense cores , and the lobes are thus not likely to be found in dense environments .",
    "subrahmanyan et al .",
    "( 1996 ) studied a small sample of grgs on the southern hemisphere . by studying the surface density of optical galaxies in the neighbourhood of the grg host galaxies using the ukst plates ,",
    "they conclude that they do not reside in rich clusters .",
    "+ grgs have relatively low radio powers ( saripalli et al .",
    "1986 ; subrahmanyan et al .",
    "1996 ) , usually around or below the luminosity which divides fri and frii type radio galaxies ( @xmath24  w  hz@xmath14 at 178  mhz ; fanaroff & riley 1974 ) .",
    "because of their large sizes and relatively low radio power , the surface brightness of grgs is low .",
    "this is why they are so difficult to find in most radio surveys . in recent years ,",
    "the westerbork northern sky survey ( wenss , rengelink et al .",
    "1997 ) has mapped the sky above + 28  declination at a frequency of 327  mhz .",
    "wenss has a sensitivity of 18  mjy ( 5@xmath25 ) and a beamsize of @xmath26 , with @xmath27 the declination . at low frequency ,",
    "the bulk of emission of radio galaxies originates in the extended radio lobes .",
    "this makes the wenss ideally suited to find large , low surface brightness radio galaxies such as grgs .",
    "the first discovery of such an object ( wnb1626 + 5153 ) has been reported by rttgering et al .",
    "this initiated a project aimed at finding and studying a large , uniformly selected , sample of giant radio sources from the wenss .",
    "+ here we report on the discovery and subsequent analysis of the radio source wnb0313 + 683 , which we have identified as an frii - type radio galaxy with a linear size of 2.0  mpc .",
    "it has several remarkable properties , among which there is a large flux asymmetry of the radio lobes and a prominent , inverted spectrum , radio core . in sect .",
    "2 , we will present the radio and optical data that we have collected on this object .",
    "section 3 describes a first analysis of these data , including a new way to measure rotation measures .",
    "it also presents some of the derived physical properties . in sect .",
    "4 we derive the advance velocities of the hotspots and the age of the source from a spectral index analysis .",
    "section 5 then discusses the observed depolarization towards wnb0313 + 683 . a discussion on the properties of the radio core is given in sect .",
    "we argue that wnb0313 + 683 may currently be in a new phase of radio activity .",
    "finally , a summary and our conclusions are presented in sect .",

    "tab : radio_obs ] .",
    "the radio source wnb0313 + 683 was noticed as a 15  large frii - type radio galaxy in the wenss and in the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; condon et al .",
    "figure [ fig : spec_indexmaps]a shows the radio contours from a map of wnb0313 + 683 from the wenss survey .",
    "clearly visible are the two bright regions at the outer edges of the radio lobes , the bridge connecting these regions , and a bright central lateral component extending to the north - west .",
    "the brightness and narrowness of the southern lobe suggests the presence of a radio jet .",
    "the northern lobe shows a protrusion at the top . from the wenss map alone",
    "it is not clear if this protrusion is part of the radio galaxy ( i.e. a hotspot ) , or due to an unrelated radio source .",
    "the total integrated flux density at 327  mhz is @xmath37  jy . flux densities for the different source components are given in tab .",
    "[ tab : fluxes ] .",
    "+ the angular resolution of the nvss survey is 45 , comparable to that of the wenss survey .",
    "the typical noise in the produced maps is 0.45  mjy  beam@xmath14 .",
    "further , the nvss provides maps of the stokes parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "figure [ fig : nvss ] shows the radio map from the nvss survey , with vectors of the observed @xmath40-field superposed .",
    "the southern lobe and the central ` bulge ' are still well detected .",
    "the bridge to the northern lobe is very faint , which is a first indication of its steep spectrum .",
    "the polarization angles in the southern lobe are more or less constant in orientation ; only near the core and the bulge there is a gradual change in polarization angle . + the weak sources at ra  @xmath41 , dec .",
    "@xmath42 and ra  @xmath43 , dec .",
    "@xmath44 ( b1950.0 ) are most probably unrelated background sources .",
    "+       the ` classical ' method for finding rotation measures is to determine the position angle of the polarized emission in each individual channel , and to plot these as a function of the square of the wavelength .",
    "the rm is then the slope of the line that fits these datapoints best .",
    "this method has proved itself extensively , but it provides little insight in the spatial distribution of the rotation measure when studying extended structures . + for this purpose , a new routine has been developed in the nfra newstar reduction and analysis package , called rotation measure mapping .",
    "this routine combines the maps of the stokes @xmath38 and @xmath39 parameter of each separate frequency channel in the following way . using an ` a priori ' guess of the rm , the @xmath38 and @xmath39 vectors in each channel are rotated ` backwards ' over the angle that they would have been rotated over by the assumed rm , relative to the frequency of the highest frequency channel",
    ". then , the @xmath38 ( and @xmath39 ) maps of all channels are vector summed",
    ". only if the chosen rm is close to the real rm , the rotated @xmath38 ( and @xmath39 ) vectors in each channel will be the same , and the length of the summed vectors will be maximal . using",
    "these vector summed @xmath38 and @xmath39 vectors , which we will refer to as @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively , we can calculate the _ summed _ polarized intensity @xmath47 , which will also be at its maximum when the correct rm is chosen . using a range of possible rms , the rm for which the summed polarized intensity is maximal , must be closest to the real value .",
    "+ the main advantage of the newstar method is that maps of summed polarized intensity can be made for a wide range of rms .",
    "these can be displayed in a movie form , so that for extended sources , like wnb0313 + 683 , one can look for systematic changes in the rm over the source .",
    "but it can also be used for a more strict analysis of the data .",
    "+ in the classical method , the spectral index and depolarization of the emission , when using widely separated frequencies , will affect the error in the measured polarization angle , and thus the accuracy of the result . in what manner",
    "exactly strongly depends on the nature of the source observed .",
    "the intrinsic _ degree _ of polarization for synchrotron radiation with a powerlaw spectrum is not frequency dependent .",
    "therefore , in radio sources with negative spectral slopes , e.g. @xmath48 , the drop in total intensity at a higher frequency can , at least partly , be counteracted by the lower amount of depolarization at that frequency .",
    "+ in order to test the accuracy and reliability of the newstar method , we have performed computer simulations , in which we analysed the same artificial input data set with the newstar and the classical method . as input we provided 500 random @xmath38 and @xmath39 intensities , which we assumed to have a frequency of 1400  mhz ( cf . the nvss survey ) . for each datapoint",
    ", we then determined the polarization angle at 1400  mhz and calculated the polarization angles at the other frequencies , using a fixed rotation measure of 10  rad  m@xmath20 . from this , the @xmath38 and @xmath39 intensities at each frequency have been determined . then noise was added using a gaussian noise distribution with a standard deviation equal to the rms noise of our real @xmath38 and @xmath39 data .",
    "+ we find that both methods recover the input rm very well , as long as the polarized intensity @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the noise in the averaged polarized intensity map corrected for ricean bias ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rm_simu ] ) . for polarized intensities @xmath51 ,",
    "the input rm is not reliably recovered .",
    "especially note the two ` sidelobes ' in the rm distribution , which are separated by @xmath52  rad  m@xmath20 from the input rm .",
    "they are the result of the @xmath53 rad ambiguity of the determination of the polarization angle in the high frequency ( nvss ) data .",
    "due to the added noise , chosing a value which is 180@xmath54 higher or lower sometimes gives a better fit through the datapoints .",
    "we find that @xmath55 of the datapoints in our simulations which have polarized intensities between 8 and @xmath56 lie in these two sidelobes .",
    "+ we have used this method to correct for the observed position angles of the @xmath40-field in the 1400-mhz nvss observations .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nvss_b - field ] .",
    "this should be compared with the orientation of the magnetic field that is observed at 10.45  ghz with the effelsberg telescope ( i.e. the vectors plotted in fig . [",
    "fig : effelsberg]a rotated by 90 ) .",
    "the @xmath52  rad  m@xmath20 ambiguity causes the small wiggle in the b - field vectors in the southern lobe of wnb0313 + 683 .",

    "<S> we present the results of a detailed analysis of the newly discovered 15@xmath0 large radio galaxy wnb0313 + 683 . </S>",
    "<S> it has been discovered in the wenss and nvss radio surveys , and has been identified with an optical galaxy at a redshift of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the linear size of the radio structure is 2.0  mpc , which places it in the class of giant radio galaxies ( grgs ) . </S>",
    "<S> + radio observations have been carried out with the wsrt at 1.4  ghz and with the 92-cm broadband system , with the 100-m effelsberg telescope at 10.45  ghz and with the vla at 1.4  ghz and 5  ghz . at 10.45  </S>",
    "<S> ghz the core is the dominant source structure , emitting @xmath2 of the total flux . </S>",
    "<S> it has an inverted spectrum with a spectral index of @xmath3 ( s@xmath4 ) between 1.4  ghz and 10.45  ghz , suggesting a very compact structure , although we can not rule out variability of the core luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> + the rotation measure distribution has been mapped using a new method and has been found to be very uniformly distributed over the source . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore probably galactic in origin , with only a small contribution from the ( surroundings of the ) source itself . </S>",
    "<S> + from the spectral index distribution we have determined an upper limit on the spectral age of @xmath5  yrs . the particle density of the ambient medium , using ram - pressure equilibrium at the hotspots , is @xmath6  @xmath7 for the southern lobe and @xmath8  @xmath7 for the northern lobe . </S>",
    "<S> an independent measure of the external density has been determined using the amount of depolarization towards the southern lobe . </S>",
    "<S> this gives a density , averaged along the line of sight , which is a factor of 10 higher ( @xmath9  @xmath7 ) than the density near the head of the lobes found using the ram - pressure arguments . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy might at least partly be the result of a contribution from internal depolarization , which we can not exclude on basis of our radio data . </S>",
    "<S> + from spectroscopical observations of the host galaxy we find that the h@xmath10 emission line has a broad component , and that the extinction must be large with colour index @xmath11  mag . since the galactic latitude is @xmath12 , the extinction is probably mostly galactic in origin . </S>",
    "<S> we further find that wnb0313 + 683 has a very large optical emission line flux with respect to its estimated jet power , when compared with the correlation between these two properties found by rawlings & saunders ( 1991 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that this , together with the relatively high radio power and the inverted radio spectrum of the radio core , is suggestive of a new phase of radio activity in wnb0313 + 683 . </S>"
