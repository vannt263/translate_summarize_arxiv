    "observations carried out for more than three decades indicate that the total hard x - ray / soft @xmath0-ray emission from the galaxy results from the superposition of multiple physical processes whose relative contribution depends on the energy .",
    "the spectrum of this emission is reasonably well measured and understood above @xmath1 1 mev from osse and comptel ( kinzer et al . , 1999 , strong et al . , 1994 , 2004a ) .",
    "at energies above @xmath1 100 mev , the dominant emission process is the decay of @xmath2 mesons produced in the interaction of cosmic - ray nucleons with the interstellar matter ( bertsch et al . , 1993 ) .",
    "between  1 and 70 mev , electron bremsstrahlung and inverse compton scattering are expected to dominate over discrete source emission ( sacher & schnfelder , 1984 , skibo et al . , 1993 , strong et al .",
    "2004a ) .    in the low - energy domain",
    ", the spectrum has been measured with rxte in the 10 - 35 kev energy band ( valinia & marshall , 1998 ) and with ginga in the 3 - 16 kev band ( yamasaki et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "more recently asca ( sugizaki et al . , 2001 ) observations in the 0.7 - 10 kev band , and chandra observations ( ebisawa et al . , 2001 ) in the 2 - 10 kev band , show that there is a genuine diffuse soft x - ray component , and this result is confirmed by xmm - newton measurements ( hands et al . ,",
    "2004 ) in the 2 - 10 kev band .",
    "however , in the hard x - ray / soft @xmath0-ray band ( 50 - 500 kev ) , the situation is more complicated as multiple components are believed to contribute to the total emission .",
    "these include discrete sources , the positron annihilation line , three - photon positronium continuum radiation and a soft @xmath0-ray component corresponding to the diffuse continuum emission induced by cosmic - ray interactions ( cr diffuse ) .",
    "unfortunately , measurements of the galactic diffuse emission in the hard x - ray / soft @xmath0-ray band and its interpretation are inherently difficult because of the presence of numerous hard x - ray discrete sources in the galactic plane .",
    "moreover , generally , hard x - ray / soft @xmath0-ray instruments either have large fields of view and no imaging capabilities or have imaging capability but no sensitivity to extended emission . as a result ,",
    "discrimination between diffuse emission and point sources remains a difficult task .",
    "for this reason , simultaneous multiple - instrument observations had been performed , with coordinated observations of the galactic center region with osse / cgro ( kurfess et al . , 1991 ) and the imaging instrument sigma / granat ( paul et al , 1991 ) .",
    "the main results were that , in the hard x - ray / soft @xmath0-ray regime , the spatial distribution of `` diffuse emission '' is broad and relatively flat in longitude , with an extension in latitude of @xmath1 @xmath3 width , while a few discrete sources contribute at least 50@xmath4 of the total emission ( purcell et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "however sigma had a sensitivity of about 25 mcrab ( 2@xmath5 ) for a typical 24 hours observation .",
    "as a result , weak sources escaped detection in its survey , and the unresolved emission was still contaminated significantly by discrete sources .",
    "the extension of the spectral shape of the galactic diffuse emission from the hard x - ray to @xmath0-ray regime , and how much of the emission was due to discrete sources remained to be precisely determined .",
    "further attempts to derive the diffuse emission characteristics followed ( kinzer et al . 1999 , 2001 ; boggs et al . , 1999 ; valinia et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "theoretical studies were unable to explain even 50% of the galactic emission as originating in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "two main processes can lead to an interstellar soft @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "the first one is inverse compton scattering of high energy ( gev ) cosmic ray electrons on the ambient photons field ; but these electrons would also produce radio synchrotron emission in the galactic magnetic field at a level much higher than one actually observed .",
    "the second process is bremsstrahlung of a population of electrons of a few hundred kev , radiating through interactions with interstellar gas . because these electrons will lose their energy through ionization and coulomb collisions , the total power required to compensate for these energy losses is of the order of @xmath6 erg@xmath7s@xmath8",
    "this power , comparable or higher than that of cosmic ray protons , would affect interstellar - medium ionization equilibrium and give rise to excessive dissociation of interstellar molecules .",
    "a possible interstellar process has been proposed by dogiel et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . alternatively , a dozen point sources with intensities around 25 mcrab ( the sigma 2@xmath5 sensitivity ) could account for most of the remaining diffuse emission .",
    "this demonstrates the need for highly sensitive imaging instruments for a precise determination of the diffuse galactic emission .",
    "+ actually , a new vision of the hard x ray sky is provided by integral with the detection of a significant amount of new sources and the discovery of a new class of objects : the highly absorbed sources ( dean et al . , 2005 ) may represent 20% of the total number of sources , but their contribution could not be evaluated by x - ray survey , with an obvious implication for the diffuse emission .",
    "a recent result based on isgri / ibis / integral data ( hereafter isgri ) shows that known binary sources account for the main part of the total galactic emission ( from 86% to 74% ) from 20 kev to 220 kev ( lebrun et al . , 2004 ,",
    "terrier et al . 2004 ) .",
    "however the limited sensitivity of isgri , above 200 kev , does not allow an extension of this study at higher energies . early study of the diffuse continuum emission using spi / integral ( hereafter spi ) shows that diffuse emission dominates above @xmath1 200 kev ( strong et al .",
    "2003 ) and that the ratio of diffuse emission to total emission vary from @xmath9 to @xmath10 along spi energy domain ( strong et al .",
    "2004b ) .",
    "spi ( see next section ) has a moderate angular resolution over a large field , thus is sensitive to extended sources as well as to point sources imaging .",
    "spi can thus be used in a self consistent way to measure both the galactic diffuse and discrete source emission , avoiding the complication due to different regions observed , different instrument responses , different models assumed and diverse ways in which results are presented ( per radian , per field - of - view etc . ) when comparisons with other instruments are made .",
    "we present the catalog of the sources detected with spi as well as their global spectral emission .",
    "an early spi sources catalog can be found in bouchet et al .",
    "moreover a broadband spectral analysis including point sources and diffuse emission components ( annihilation , positronium and cr diffuse continuum ) has been performed in a self consistent way , i.e using the same instrument for both sources detection and diffuse emission estimate .",
    "we draw attention to an independent , complementary study on this topic by strong et al .",
    "the spectrometer spi ( vedrenne et al . , 2003 ) is one of the two main instruments onboard esa s integral ( international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory ) observatory launched from baikonour , kazakhstan , on 2002 october 17 .",
    "it consists of an array of 19 actively cooled high resolution germanium ( ge ) detectors with an area of 508 @xmath11 and a thickness of 7 cm .",
    "it is surrounded by a 5-cm thick bgo shield .",
    "the detectors cover the 20 kev - 8 mev energy range with an energy resolution ranging from 2 to 8 kev as a function of energy .",
    "in addition to its spectroscopic capability , spi can image the sky with a spatial resolution of @xmath12 over a field of view of @xmath13 , thanks to its coded mask .",
    "despite such a modest angular resolution , it is possible to locate intense sources with an accuracy of few arc minutes ( dubath et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "+ a complete integral orbit lasts @xmath143 days , but scientific data can not be accumulated when the instrument is crossing the radiation belts , reducing the useful observing time @xmath14 2.5 days . the instrument in - flight performance",
    "is given in roques et al .",
    "each integral orbital revolution consists of several exposures ( typically , 30 - 40 minutes pointings dithering around the target ) . due to the small number of detectors , imaging which relies on these observations in dithering mode ( jensen et al . , 2003 ) , the pointing direction varying by steps of @xmath15 within a @xmath16 square or a 7-point hexagonal pattern .",
    "the data used to perform this analysis were recorded from 2003 , march 3 to 2003 , october 19 , including in total 42 revolutions ( table 1 ) .",
    "they cover the region @xmath17",
    "@xmath18 l @xmath18 @xmath19 , @xmath20 @xmath18 b @xmath18 @xmath21 most of these data have been obtained through the gcde ( galactic center deep exposure ) part of the integral core program ( winkler et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "data polluted by solar flares and radiation belt entries are excluded . after image analysis and cleaning",
    ", there is 2552 pointings , which represent 5.75@xmath2210@xmath23 seconds of effective observing time .",
    "the data analysis is done in 2 steps .",
    "the first one concerns the determination of the positions of the emitting sources .",
    "we have used spiros , a software delivered in the integral osa package to produce images . in a second step ,",
    "we have developed a dedicated software to extract fluxes from the positions obtained with spiros .",
    "spiros v6 ( spi iterative removal of sources ) algorithm has been used to derive source positions , with the mcm background option ( mode 5 ) .",
    "spiros ( skinner & connell , 2003 ) , a part of the integral science data centre ( isdc ) package produces synthetic and simplified sky images : they consist of a limited number of sky pixels , those which contain excesses above a given threshold .",
    "an important limitation is that sources are considered as constant during the image reconstruction process . as a consequence , at low energy ( @xmath24 50 kev ) ,",
    "some exposures exhibit an unacceptable @xmath25 fit of raw data to the reconstructed sky image convolved by the response matrix along with biased residuals distribution .",
    "we found this effect to be due to intensity variations of the most intense sources , which are not taken into account . to suppress the effect of the variability of the strongest sources , a special iterative scheme described in ",
    "4.2.2 has been used .",
    "spiros works both with known and unknown sources .",
    "if an input catalog is given , spiros will first build a sky model with the proposed sources then looks for a number a new ones required by the data .",
    "one must take care of the influence of the source position errors on the image generation .",
    "if the source position introduced in spiros is different from the true position ( even slightly ) , the iterative removal of sources algorithm leads to subsequent artefacts in the image .",
    "this problem may become important for strong sources or when a large number of sources has inaccurate positions .",
    "thus , whenever possible , the exact source positions should be introduced in spiros as _ a - priori _ knowledge ( input catalog ) in order to avoid these cumulative errors .",
    "but , _ a contrario _ , to use an input catalog with too many ( non - emitting ) sources also leads to unstable solution .",
    "our analysis philosophy ( see  5 ) takes into account both limitations .      a complete model fitting procedure ( called `` time - model - fit '' ) based on the likelihood statistics",
    "has been developed ( see annexe a-1 ) .",
    "the input sky model can include both point sources and diffuse components .",
    "the main features of the algorithm are : + - a self determination of the background distribution on the detector plane . + - a time dependent background normalization determination + - a time dependent flux determination for each point source with its own timescale ( meaningless for diffuse components ) .",
    "the spi imaging system , although using a combination of a coded mask with a position sensitive detector , needs , due to the small number of detector pixels , a dithering scheme to increase the number of sky pixels that can be reconstructed .",
    "this results in a time modulation of the sky signal . in order not to confuse such modulation with background variations , the background versus time profile of the 19 detectors has to be evaluated .",
    "the construction of a time - dependend background model constitutes a key point of spi data analysis .",
    "analyses of `` empty - field '' observations have shown that , for any energy band , the relative count rates ( uniformity map ) of the 19 ge detectors are constant while the global amplitude ( normalization factor ) varies with time .",
    "we thus have to determined the relative count - rates of the 19 ge detectors ( background counts - ratio pattern depending on the energy band ) leaving normalization as the only free parameter for the background intensity .",
    "this is included inside the model fitting procedure as described in annexe a-2 with the background amplitude able to vary on the pointing ( @xmath12500 s ) timescale .",
    "the spi image reconstruction relies on the dithering . as a result ,",
    "variability of sources has to be explicitly included in the system of equations to be solved .",
    "this is included in our model fitting procedure by means of additionnal equations ( annexe a-3 ) .",
    "for each source , the allowed variation time scale can be chosen . in practice",
    ", it has to be carefully used as the number of parameters ( unknown fluxes ) necessary to describe the sky will increase , correspondingly the significances decrease .",
    "there is also a mathematical limitation : since there are 19 independent data per pointing , it means that , whatever the number of pointings , there can not be more than 19 variable sources on the time scale of a pointing .",
    "however , most of the sources are weak enough to neglect the influence of their variability on the image reconstruction , and thus can be considered as constant .",
    "even flaring sources are too weak and/or shortliving ( e.g. sgr 1806 - 20 ) to have any effect on long period .",
    "+ in this work , the `` time - model - fit '' tool has been used for a dedicated variability treatment applied only to the most intense sources , namely , 4u 1700 - 377 , sco x-1 and oao 1657 - 4154 , below 50 kev .",
    "we build for them the light curves in a one pointing time scale .",
    "the corresponding contributions in the count space are then substracted from the original data to derive a `` corrected '' data set to use as spiros input .",
    "this cleaning is done from the original data set for each iteration , as the strong sources contributions can be affected by new sources introduction .",
    "+ applying this scheme to the whole data set in the 25 - 50 kev energy band improves the global reduced @xmath25 from 3.24 ( standard procedure ) to 1.33 ( table 3 ) .",
    "images are built using all our data in the following energy bands : 300 - 600 kev , 150 - 300 kev , 50 - 150 kev and 25 - 50 kev . in order to minimise bias ( see  4.1 ) ,",
    "the first step of the analysis was performed without any _ a - priori _ information about known sources .",
    "the _ a priori _ knowledge is introduced progressively . for each image",
    ", spiros is parametrized in order to search for up to 30 new excesses above 2@xmath5 in addition to the input catalog built from the previous iteration .",
    "this process ( i.e. to fix found positions ) suppresses the instabilities of such an iros algorithm .",
    "moreover , such a procedure leads to a minimal sky model able to represent the data .",
    "the catalog generation process is the following :    * the first image is obtained from spiros with an empty input catalog and gives a list of source candidates . * a catalog is built with : ( i ) all identified sources above 5@xmath5 with their celestial positions .",
    "( ii ) the unidentified excesses above 5@xmath5 with the positions found .",
    "the source identification process is described  5.1 .",
    "this current catalog is completely regenerated at each iteration as significances can evolve .",
    "* we run spiros again with this catalog as input , obtain a new list of sources / excesses , and restart with step 2 * this iterative analysis continues until no other potential excess @xmath26 2@xmath5 can be found .",
    "a flow chart illustrates this process in figure 1 .",
    "+ the final position catalog for a given energy band is built from the last iteration , where sources and excesses with a significance threshold fixed to 4 @xmath5 are accepted .",
    "the use of a dedicated catalog for each energy band allows us to restrict the number of free parameters to the minimum needed , thus decreasing the flux detection limit at high energy .",
    "figure 2 and 3 present the images obtained by spiros in the 25 - 50 kev and 50 - 150 kev energy bands using our corresponding catalogs in input .      to obtain source identification x - ray source catalogs are used .",
    "primarly , the isgri catalogs ( bird et al . , 2004 ,",
    "revnivtsev et al . ,",
    "2004 ) are used and , if nothing is found , the isdc catalog is used ( ebisawa et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "each excess is considered associated with the nearest known emitting x/@xmath0 ray sources whose distance is less than @xmath27 .",
    "this rather high value , 3 times the theoretical value for a @xmath28 detection ( dubath et al . , 2005 ) ,",
    "is used because the source localisation precision is degraded when more than one source is present , especially for crowded regions .",
    "note however that this value is much less than the geometrical resolving power ( 2.6@xmath29 ) , as the dithering pattern amounts to improving the imaging system .",
    "+ so , two known sources closer than @xmath27 can be retrieved depending on the statistics ( dubath et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "the galactic center region is an exception as too many sources are present in a small area .",
    "so we represent the @xmath27 region around the galactic center by only one source , namely 1e 1740.7 - 2942 .",
    "a more sophisticated scheme is used for the 25 - 50 kev band : the dataset used is divided in two parts , one constructed with odd pointing numbers the other with even pointing numbers ; then two sub - images are built .",
    "a non - identified excess is considered as source candidate if it is detected in both images ( cross validation method ) .",
    "this method drastically reduces the number of false source detections introduced by systematics , mainly due to variable sources .",
    "+ the number of excesses as function of the threshold level is shown in table 2 . above 150 kev and below 5@xmath5 , the number of unidentified excesses increase rapidely . from this , empirical thresholds of 5@xmath5 and 4 @xmath5 respectively below and above 150 kev have been fixed .",
    "once the position catalogs completed , we build a complete sky model including the detected point sources plus diffuse emission morphologies ( described is  6.1 ) .",
    "+ fluxes and significances for each of this sky model components are thus computed in a set of energy bands , using `` time - fit -model '' (  4.2 ) .",
    "the fluxes of point sources and diffuse emission are assumed constant ( except for the 20 - 50 kev band , where 4u 1700 - 377 , sco x-1 and oao",
    "1657 - 4154 vary on the time scale of one pointing ) .",
    "the background normalization is adjusted on a time scale of one pointing .",
    "+ excesses above 4.5@xmath5 are kept to form the final catalogs .",
    "their fluxes and significances are computed again to be consistent ; thus the final catalogs contain some sources below 4.5@xmath5 that were previously detected above this threshold .",
    "this process is described in figure 4 .",
    "the final @xmath25 obtained with this method between the proposed sky model and the data are shown in table 3 .",
    "the use of a dedicated input catalog for each energy band allows us to optimize the signal - to - noise ratio per energy band .",
    "+ these catalogs are far from exhaustive : in the computed 1-year - averaged emission , weak or short - transient sources can be completely washed out .",
    "moreover , as we looked for a minimal sky model , and given the modest spi angular resolution , only one source is necessary to represent the complex regions ( 1e 1740.7 - 2942 for instance ) .",
    "this work , based on the whole dataset , has been complemented by applying the same procedure in 3 subsets , sorting data according to the average galactic longitude of each observation ( table 1 ) : positive ( l @xmath30 ) , negative ( l @xmath31 ) and central ( @xmath32 @xmath18 l @xmath18 @xmath33 ) longitudes , that have more or less equal exposures .",
    "these new datasets allow us to add four sources in the 25 - 50 kev band catalog .",
    "these sources are labelled with an asterisk .    as the final result ,",
    "in the 25 - 50 kev domain the catalog contains 63 excesses above 4@xmath5 ; 59 have been identified with known hard x - ray objects in the ibis catalog , 4 are tentatively associated with x - ray sources ( labelled with * * ) . among the tentatively identified sources , the source at ( l , b)=(1.94@xmath29,-2.02@xmath29 ) has a quite high significance of 11.2@xmath5 , while its flux is only 6.3 mcrab .",
    "it could represent several weak ( eventually extended ) sources below isgri detection threshold that are integrated within the spi angular resolution .",
    "it could also results from variable sources not taken into account or from errors accumulation due , for example , to a wrong center - of - gravity of the many sources that compose our so - called ` 1e 1740.7 - 2942 ' source actually fixed at the 1e 1740.7 - 2942 position .",
    "intensive simulations are needed to understand the behaviour of the instrument in such a crowded region , and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "mean fluxes and significances are given in 3 energy bands : 25 - 50 kev , 50 - 150 kev,150 - 300 kev ( table 4 ) .",
    "in the 50 - 150 kev band , the catalog contains 20 excesses above 4@xmath5 ( table 5 ) ; all but one correspond to confirmed sources , the last identification is only tentative .",
    "finally , 4 known objects emit significantly above 150 kev ( table 6 ) .",
    "we will now concentrate on the relative contribution of point sources to the galatic ridge emission as a function of the energy range .    in the soft @xmath0 ray regime ,",
    "multiple components contribute to the total emission .",
    "these include discrete sources , positron annihilation line and three - photon positronium annihilation continuum , and a diffuse continuum resulting probably from cosmic ray interactions with the interstellar medium .",
    "spi is sensitive to both discrete sources and diffuse emission . as a consequence",
    "the discrete sources should always be extracted simultaneously with diffuse emission .",
    "however it is difficult to separate / distinguish extended and discrete sources emission if too many free parameters are to be determined : the error bars then become very large , and it may be impossible to derive meaningful information from the analysis .",
    "therefore as much _ a priori _ information as possible is included in the analysis : + - precise external source locations is used in catalogs .",
    "+ - spatial morphologies derived from previous works for each diffuse component are used and fixed _ a priori_. +        in order to estimate the total point source emission , it is obvious that all the discrete sources ( also weak , transient and possibly undetected ) should be included in the analysis . on the other hand , increasing the number of sources decreases the significance of the measurement .",
    "thus only the significant sources are introduced in the analysis , their number depending on the considered energy band .",
    "three spectral regions are considered : +    * in the 20 - 150 kev energy range , the 63 sources of the 25 - 50 kev catalog have been introduced . * in the 150 - 300 kev energy range , the 20 sources of our 50 - 150 kev catalog is used . * above 300 kev , the 4 sources detected above 150 kev have been considered .      the diffuse emission morphology in the 50 - 400 kev estimated by measurements from osse / gro ( purcell et al . , 1996 , kinzer et al . , 1999 ) and confirmed with subsequent simultaneous rxte and osse observations ( valinia et al . , 2000 ) , is broadly distributed in longitude with a @xmath34 fwhm in latitude and a @xmath35 extent in longitude .",
    "however since most of this emission at least in the low energy range is due to point sources ( lebrun et al . , 2004 ) , it can not be used to represent the cr diffuse component . a better model may be the co map ( dame et al . , 2001 ) since it is a tracer of the interstellar matter . in the absence of a better model and for simplicity ,",
    "the cr diffuse continuum spatial morphology is modelled by the co map .",
    "nevertheless , this point constitutes a weakness , as finally the morphology is poorly determined .",
    "the annihilation line detected by spi has been used to study the 511 kev spatial morphology ( kndlseder et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "this component is equally well described by models that represent the stellar bulge , by halo populations or by an azimuthally symmetric gaussian with fwhm of @xmath1 @xmath36 ( kndlseder et al . ,",
    "we thus modelled it with this last simpler hypothesis .",
    "+ a recent study of the positronium annihilation emission with spi shows that its all - sky distribution is consistent with that of the 511 kev electron - positron annihilation ( weidenspointmer et al . , 2005 ) . in the absence of any other information",
    ", the three - photon positronium continuum is assumed to have the same spatial distribution as the annihilation line .",
    "component intensities of the sky model are extracted channel by channel with the time - model - fit algorithm described in  4.2 . then , count rates are converted into photon spectra for each component . the total point source contribution to the galactic emission",
    "is obtained by summing all the point source spectra in the central radian , excluding those from sco x-1 and cen a which are located at high galactic latitude ( b @xmath37 20 @xmath29 ) .",
    "+ figure 5 shows the composite spectrum of the three major components .    the summed point source emission ( upper one )",

    "the cr diffuse emission spectrum is more complex .",
    "below 50 kev it clearly exhibits a soft component .",
    "in the 300 - 500 kev domain , there is clearly some cross - talk between the positron annihilation and the cr diffuse continuum components .",
    "this can be easily understood as we try to fit simultaneously two sky model distributions that have a common part in the inner galaxy where the exposure time is the highest .",
    "+ the cr diffuse continuum fit above 50 kev , excluding 300 - 500 kev points ( figure 5 ) , gives a photon power law index of @xmath1 -1.8 @xmath43 and a 100 kev flux of ( 6 @xmath442 ) @xmath22 10@xmath45 photons  @xmath42  s@xmath8  kev@xmath8 for a reduced @xmath25 of 0.3(8 dof ) .",
    "+ in addition , a fit using only data whose pointing direction is outside the central radian , and supposed to contain insignificant electron - positron annihilation emission , gives a power index of 1.7@xmath43 above 50 kev . + these two indexes",

    ", 1993 ) , which can be approximated by a power law with index of @xmath1 -1.65 over the 50 kev-10 mev range .",
    "as we poorly constrain this parameter , we decided to fix the power law index to 1.65 .",
    "+ finally , in the 20 - 1800 kev energy range , and excluding the 300 - 500 kev band , the cr diffuse continuum spectrum is modelled by two components to give a reduced @xmath25 of 0.5 ( 8 dof ) : the first one is a power law with a photon index 1.7 @xmath43 and a cutoff energy of 20 kev , having a 50 kev flux of ( 3.1 @xmath44 0.7 ) @xmath22 10@xmath41 photons  @xmath42  s@xmath8  kev@xmath8 .",

    "in fact , the cr diffuse component in the 300 - 500 kev energy range is clearly overestimated , leading to an underestimation of the positronium flux .",
    "a more complex and adequate method has thus been proposed for this spectral region ( see next section ) .",
    "+      the photon spectra extraction method applied above (  6.2 ) presents the advantages to be spectral model independent and relatively easy to implement .",
    "its `` simplicity '' lies on approximations well - suited only for energies below @xmath1 300 kev .",
    "indeed , the spi response is averaged over all the exposures for a given component , and the energy redistribution matrix is not properly taken into account .",
    "the latter can lead to significant errors particularly in the case of photon spectra with positive slope , such as the positronium continuum ( i.e. above 300 kev ) .",
    "for these reasons a complete model fitting software has been developed , in which the emission photon spectral models of each sky components are convolved with the full spi response ( sturner et al . , 2003 ) for each pointing .",
    "this algorithm is detailed in annex b. in the other hand , this kind of algorithm allows to fix the shape of the spectra as a function of the energy , via an analytique emission model . as a consequence",
    ", the problem of `` cross - talk '' previously encountered is drastically reduced .",
    "+ each photon spectral component follows an appropriate emission model whose parameters can be adjusted simultaneously to the whole set of data along with the background intensity .",
    "given the size of the dataset such an algorithm can lead to prohibitive computing time and memory space if the number of free parameters is too high . fortunately , the benefit of this method is more significant at high energy , where the source number is low .    moreover , we limit the number of free parameters by fixing some of them .",
    "first , as the used energy band is limited to 300 kev- 1 mev , the slope of the power law that modelled the cr diffuse emission is fixed to 1.65 while the flux is to be fit .",
    "second , the point source emission consists of 4 discrete sources ( table 4 ) whose spectra are represented a by power law with an exponential cut - off .",
    "because the source statistics are low , the indices and normalizations of these power laws have been previously determined below 150 kev by the first method (  6.2 ) , while the cutoff energy is to be fitted .",
    "results may slightly depend on the sources spectral shape assumed above 300 kev .",
    "+ the annihilation spectrum ( positronium continuum plus line ) is then determined by the complete model fitting .    a line flux of ( 0.93@xmath440.15 ) 10@xmath46 photons  @xmath42  s@xmath8 and a positronium fraction of 0.97@xmath47 are found .",
    "the 100 kev flux of the diffuse emission is 5@xmath443 @xmath22 10@xmath45 photons  @xmath42  s@xmath8  kev@xmath8 , in perfect agreement with previous determinations .",
    "the reduced @xmath25 of the fit is 0.99 ( 630337 dof ) , the reduced @xmath25 for each energy band are distributed between 0.95 and 1.2 .",
    "+ the result is illustrated in figure 6 .",
    "despite the spi instrument s moderate angular resolution , and benefitting from the large number of pointings , a first catalog of hard x - ray sources detected by spi / integral in the galactic plane between @xmath17 @xmath18 l @xmath18 @xmath19 , @xmath20 @xmath18 b @xmath18 @xmath48 has been derived .",
    "+ this catalog contains 63 sources and gives their fluxes up to 300 kev .",
    "it has been built by means of model - fitting procedure simultaneously applied to all pointings of the whole dataset of 5.7@xmath2210@xmath23 seconds , and represents the minimal averaged sky model needed to decribe the data .",
    "thus transient sources could escape detection .",
    "moreover , due to the modest spi angular resolution , our sky model in crowded regions is simplified , with one point source representing the combined emission of all sources near 1e 1740.7 - 2942 . on the other hand , this catalog is perfectly suited to estimate the point source contribution to the galactic ridge emission .",
    "+ the diffuse emission components ( continuum , 511 kev and positronium ) have been studied by fixing their spatial distributions , as a first order model , and taking into account our catalog .",
    "+ the main conclusions are :    * point sources contribute at least for 85 - 90% of the total galactic emission in the energy range 25 to 140 kev .",
    "this independantly confirms the isgri result that point sources largely dominate the total galactic emission ( lebrun et al . , 2004 ) at least up to 250 kev .",
    "the interstellar emission is around 15 % of the total emission up to 150 kev .",
    "the low energy part ( @xmath24 250 kev ) of the total spectrum is source dominated while the high energy part ( @xmath49 250 kev ) is diffuse dominated . *",
    "the cr diffuse emission ( 50 - 250 kev ) can be fitted with a power law joining smoothly the high energy continuum as measured by osse ( kinzer et al . , 1999 ) and",
    "comptel ( strong et al . , 1994 ) above 1 mev . *",
    "no additional spectral component is needed above the power law spectrum to model the diffuse continuum above 50 kev . the soft diffuse component reported by kinzer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) in this region is mostly due to point sources not taken into account by this instrument . * below 50 kev ,",
    "a real diffuse soft component can still exist , but may also be related to very steep / weak x - ray sources not included in the present analysis .",
    "* there is no evidence of 511 kev point source emission , in agreement with the conclusion drawn by kndlseder et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . *",
    "a positronium fraction 0.97@xmath47 and a 511 kev flux of ( 0.93 @xmath440.15 ) 10@xmath46 photons  @xmath42  s@xmath8 .",
    "this positronium fraction is compatible with the osse determination : 0.93 @xmath44 0.04 ( kinzer et al . , 2001 ) and spi / integral determinations of 0.94 @xmath44 0.06 ( churazov et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "these results constitute a first step as they are based on spi data taken during the first year of operation and will be obviously refined in the future .",
