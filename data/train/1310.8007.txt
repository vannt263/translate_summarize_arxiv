    "one way to describe the content of these lecture notes is to say that they give a proof of the following statement ( up to certain technical details that can be looked up in suitable articles ) .",
    "[ theorem1.1 ] let @xmath1 be independent standard brownian motions .",
    "define @xmath2 then , for any @xmath3 , @xmath4 with certain explicit @xmath5-dependent constants @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the distribution function of the gue tracy - widom distribution .",
    "the quantity @xmath8 was introduced by oconnell - yor @xcite , and it can be viewed as the partition function of a semi - discrete brownian polymer ( also sometimes referred to as the `` oconnell - yor polymer '' ) .",
    "the limit relation above shows that this polymer model belongs to the celebrated kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) universality class , see corwin @xcite for details on the kpz class and  1.6 of @xcite for more explanations , consequences , and references concerning the polymer interpretation .",
    "the exact value of @xmath9 was conjectured by oconnell - yor @xcite and proven by moriarty - oconnell @xcite , and the above limit theorem was proven by borodin - corwin @xcite for a restricted range of @xmath5 and by borodin - corwin - ferrari @xcite for all @xmath3 .",
    "a nice physics - oriented explanation of @xmath10 was given by spohn @xcite .",
    "although the most direct proof of this theorem would likely be quite a bit shorter than these notes , brevity was not our goal . despite the probabilistic appearance of the statement ,",
    "any of the known approaches to the proof would involve a substantial algebraic component , and the appearance of algebra at first seems at least slightly surprising .",
    "the goal of these lectures notes is to suggest the most logically straightforward path ( in authors opinion ) that leads to the desired result , minimizing as much as possible the number of _ ad hoc _ steps one takes along the way .",
    "( for an interested reader we remark that a shorter proof of theorem [ theorem1.1 ] can be obtained via combining corollary 4.2 of @xcite , theorem 2 of @xcite , and asymptotic analysis of @xcite . )    as we travel along our path ( that naturally starts on the algebraic side  in representation theory of unitary groups ) , we encounter other probabilistic models that are amenable to similar tools of analysis .",
    "the approach that we develop has a number of other applications as well .",
    "it was so far used for ( we refer the reader to the indicated references for further explanations )    * asymptotics of the kpz equation with a certain class of initial conditions @xcite ; * asymptotics of log - gamma fully discrete random directed polymers @xcite ; * asymptotics of @xmath11-tasep and asep @xcite , @xcite ; * analysis of new integrable ( 1 + 1)d interacting particle systems  discrete time @xmath11-taseps of @xcite , @xmath11-pushasep @xcite , @xcite , and @xmath11-hahn tasep @xcite ; * establishing a law of large numbers for infinite random matrices over a finite field @xcite ( conjectured by vershik and kerov , see @xcite ) ; * gaussian free field asymptotics of the general beta jacobi corners process @xcite ; * developing spectral theory for the @xmath11-boson particle system @xcite and other integrable particle systems @xcite ; * asymptotics of probabilistic models originating from representation theory of the infinite - dimensional unitary group @xmath12 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    the emerging domain of studying such models that enjoy the benefits of a rich algebraic structure behind , is sometimes called _ integrable probability _ , and we refer the reader to the introduction of borodin - gorin @xcite for a brief discussion of the domain and of its name ( the integrable nature of the semi - discrete polymer of theorem [ theorem1.1 ] was first established by oconnell @xcite ) .",
    "to a certain extent , the present text may be considered as a continuation of @xcite , but it can be also read independently .",
    "in contrast with @xcite , in our exposition below we do not shy away from the representation theoretic background and intuition that were essential in developing the subject .",
    "we also focus on proving a single theorem , rather than describing the variety of other related problems listed above , in order to discuss in depth the analytic difficulties arising in converting an algebraic formalism into analytic statements .",
    "these difficulties are related to the phenomenon of _ intermittency _ and popular yet highly non - rigorous and sometimes dangerous _",
    "replica trick _ favoured by physicists , and one of our goals is to show how raising the amount of `` algebraization '' of the problem can be used to overcome them .",
    "the notes are organized as follows .    in section",
    "[ sec : lozenge_tilings_and_representation_theory ] , we explain how lozenge tilings of a class of polygons on the triangular lattice can be interpreted via representation theory of the unitary groups , and how this leads to contour integral formulas for averages of various observables .    in section [ sec : asymptotics ] , we show , in a specific example , how the steepest descent analysis of the obtained contour integrals yields meaningful probabilistic information about lozenge tilings .",
    "section [ sec : markov_dynamics ] describes an approach to constructing local markov dynamics on lozenge tilings , and how ( 1 + 1)-dimensional interacting particle systems ( like usual and long range totally asymmetric simple exclusion processes ( taseps ) ) arise as marginals of such dynamics .",
    "the approach we describe is relatively recent ; it was developed in borodin - petrov @xcite ( an extension of the method will appear in @xcite ) .    section [ sec:_q_t_generalization ] deals with a two - parameter ( macdonald , @xmath0- ) generalization of the previous material .    in section [ sec : asymptotics_of_q_deformed_growth_models ] we show how simple - minded asymptotics of the contour integrals in the @xmath11-deformation of lozenge tilings leads to semi - discrete brownian polymers .",
    "the contour integrals describe the @xmath11-moments of the @xmath11-tasep , an integrable deformation of the usual tasep .",
    "section [ sec : moments_for_q_whittaker_processes ] explains difficulties which arise if one straightforwardly tries to describe the distribution of the polymer partition function using its moments .",
    "the latter come out naturally as limits of the @xmath11-tasep s @xmath11-moments .    in final section [ sec : laplace_transforms ]",
    "we demonstrate how those difficulties can be overcome through considering the laplace transform of the polymer partition function and its @xmath11-analog for the @xmath11-tasep particle locations .      these are notes for lectures delivered at the 2013 cornell probability summer school , and we would like to thank the organizers for the invitation and warm hospitality .",
