    "modifications to gravity are not needed . because of the important role that the non - abelian gauge field theories play at describing the known fundamental interactions , it is clear that gauge - flation represents a step ahead in the aim of merging inflationary cosmology and particle physics .",
    "indeed , the presence of non - abelian gauge fields allows us to easily and adequately connect inflation with the physics of the subsequent evolution of the universe ( e.g. , preheating@xcite and reheating@xcite ) .",

    "the mass is the same for all three fields , the only choice which is consistent with the needed symmetries : homogeneity and isotropy . on the other hand , this lagrangian breaks the gauge symmetry explicitly , and consequently we can not apply a gauge fixing condition as was done for the original model .",
    "nevertheless , we find a way to use the same field configuration as in the original massless gauge - flation model as shown in the following section .",
