    "radial pulsating variables , whether they are population i or population ii stars , are of great relevance in several fields of modern astrophysics . in particular , rr lyrae variables are widely used , via the calibration of their absolute visual magnitude @xmath7(rr ) in terms of the iron - to - hydrogen content [ fe / h ] , as standard candles for distance determination in the local group . on this basis",
    ", they provide an independent test of the cepheid distance scale for nearby galaxies ( magellanic clouds , m31 ) as well as a calibration of secondary distance indicators ( e.g. , the globular cluster luminosity function ) in external galaxies , thus yielding relevant clues about the value of the hubble constant . on the other hand ,",
    "since the absolute magnitude of the globular cluster main sequence turn - off is a classical `` clock '' to estimate the age of these ancient stellar systems , one easily understands the relevance of an accurate rr lyrae distance scale for cosmological studies .",
    "accordingly , a huge amount of work has been made in the last years to establish the absolute magnitude of horizontal branch ( hb ) stars , and particularly of rr lyrae variables , and its dependence on the star metal content .",
    "unfortunately , a general consensus has not been achieved yet , leading to the well - known debate between the so - named `` short '' and `` long '' distance scale .    on the observational side ( e.g. , baade - wesselink method , hipparcos and statistical parallax ) ,",
    "the estimates of @xmath7(rr ) suggest relatively faint magnitudes , although leaving significant uncertainties ( @xmath2 0.1 mag , see vandenberg et al .",
    "2000 , hereafter vdb , and references therein ) . as a matter of example , in the recent review by cacciari ( 1999 ) the empirical values of @xmath7(rr ) at [ fe / h]=@xmath81.6 actually range from @xmath4 0.4 to @xmath4 0.7 mag",
    "moreover , it should be mentioned that fernley et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and groenewegen & salaris ( 1999 ) , by assuming the same slope @xmath9(rr)/@xmath10 [ fe / h]=0.18 mag / dex , give respectively @xmath7(rr)=0.78@xmath60.15 mag and 0.50@xmath60.26 mag at [ fe / h]=@xmath81.5 , as derived from an identical sample of variables but using statistical parallaxes or reduced parallaxes , respectively . in reality ,",
    "not only the zero - point but also the slope of the @xmath7(rr)-[fe / h ] relation is matter of considerable debate and in the relevant literature one finds values in the range of @xmath4 0.13 to @xmath4 0.30 mag / dex .    as for the theoretical studies based on hb models , all recent computations that adopt up - to - date physics suggest absolute magnitudes which are somehow brighter than empirical estimates , at fixed [ fe / h ] .",
    "however , evolutionary predictions themselves , as provided by the various researchers , still suggest significant discrepant ( both in the zero - point and the slope ) @xmath7(rr)-[fe / h ] relations ( see vdb ; caputo et al .",
    "2000 and references therein ) . on this issue",
    ", it should be noted that hb evolutionary models provide a relation between the bolometric luminosity @xmath11 and the overall metallicity @xmath0 .",
    "thus , any comparison among the various evolutionary predicted @xmath7(rr)-[fe / h ] relations is affected by two factors of critical importance : a ) the conversion of bolometric luminosity and effective temperature into magnitude and color , i.e. the adopted bolometric correction and temperature - color transformation , and b ) the scaling between the theoretical @xmath0 and the measured [ fe / h ] value , i.e. the adopted ratio between @xmath12-elements and iron .",
    "these factors are still more important when theoretical predictions are compared with observed quantities . in addition , we wish also to mention that the constraints inferred by evolutionary models refer to `` @xmath13 '' stars , whereas the rr lyrae observed magnitudes are `` @xmath14 '' quantities averaged over the pulsation cycle , which not necessarily are exactly alike static values .    in this context , it is of great help to consider simultaneously the double nature of rr lyrae stars - from one side , radial pulsators , from the other one , low - mass ( @xmath15 0.85@xmath16 ) he - burning stars - since the pulsational quantities ( i.e. period and amplitude of pulsation ) depend on the star structural parameters ( mass , luminosity and effective temperature ) , and are firm and safe observables as well , fully independent of distance and reddening .    on this ground , we planned to construct an exhaustive and homogeneous theoretical framework , both on the pulsational and the evolutionary side , aiming at a sound analysis of observed rr lyrae stars at various metal contents ( see castellani , caputo & castellani 2003 , paper i , for the observational scenario of variables in galactic globular clusters ) .",
    "extensive sets of nonlinear convective pulsation models ( di criscienzo , marconi & caputo 2003 , paper iii , in preparation ) and hb evolutionary tracks ( cassisi , castellani , caputo & castellani 2003 , paper iv , in preparation ) are computed using the same input physics .",
    "then , adopting similar bolometric corrections and color - temperature transformations , self - consistent predictions concerning various stellar parameters are derived .",
    "the general procedure is discussed in the present paper , which deals with the results at @xmath0=0.001 and @xmath1=0.24 .",
    "we selected this metal content as suitable for the analysis of several rr lyrae rich globular clusters , in particular m3 which is the most rr lyrae rich cluster in the galaxy and among the best studied ones .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : section 2 presents the pulsation models and gives the relevant relations among the various parameters , while the constraints from stellar evolution theory are discussed in section 3 .",
    "the comparison with available @xmath17 photometry of rr lyrae variables in m3 is presented in section 4 .",
    "discussion and some brief remarks close the paper .",
    "the nonlinear convective hydrodynamical code used for pulsation model computations has been already described in a series of papers ( see , e.g. , bono & stellingwerf 1994 ; bono et al .",
    "1997a , b ) and it will not be discussed further .",
    "we wish only to mention that the models adopt recent opacity compilations by iglesias & rogers ( 1996 ) for temperatures higher than 10,000 k and by alexander & ferguson ( 1994 ) for lower temperatures . as in previous papers , a mixing length parameter @xmath5=1.5 is adopted in order to close the system of convective and dynamic equations . however , to gain some insight into how the boundaries for instability are dependent on convection ( see caputo et al .",
    "2000 ) , additional models with @xmath5=2.0 are computed , also in view of the values for the mixing length parameter recently used in hb model computations ( see sect .",
    "3 ) .    for the pulsation models with @xmath0=0.001",
    ", we adopt two masses ( @xmath18=0.65 and 0.75@xmath19 ) and three luminosity levels ( log@xmath20=1.51 , 1.61 , 1.72 ) in order to explore the dependence on the stellar mass and luminosity . for",
    "each given set of entry parameters , the computations are performed by decreasing the effective temperature @xmath21 by steps of 100 - 200 k. in the following , we refer to the results from the first ( bluest ) pulsating model to the last ( reddest ) one .",
    "let us be clearly understood that increasing ( decreasing ) by 100 k the effective temperature of the bluest ( reddest ) pulsators yields non - pulsating structures .",
    "since the adopted nonlinear approach supplies not only the pulsation period , but also the luminosity variation along the whole pulsation cycle , the bolometric light curves are transformed into the observational plane by adopting bolometric corrections and temperature - color transformations provided by castelli , gratton & kurucz ( 1997a , b , hereafter cgka , b ) . in this way , amplitudes and @xmath14 absolute magnitudes , either intensity - weighted and magnitude - weighted , are derived in the various photometric bands .",
    "table 1 lists selected results for fundamental ( f ) pulsators with 0.65@xmath19 , log@xmath20=1.61 and @xmath5=1.5 .",
    "for each given effective temperature , we give the static magnitude , i.e. the value the star would have were it not pulsating , the period @xmath22 ( in days ) , mean intensity - weighted @xmath23 and magnitude - weighted ( @xmath24 ) magnitudes , and amplitudes @xmath25 . table 2 has the same meaning , but holds for first - overtone ( fo ) pulsators .",
    "as well known since the original ritter s formulation @xmath26=@xmath27 ( @xmath28 is the star density and @xmath27 the pulsation constant ) , the basic physics underlying radial variability suggests that the pulsation period depends on the mass , luminosity and effective temperature of pulsators .",
    "linear interpolation among all our data supplies a refined version of earlier pulsation equations ( see , e.g. , van albada & baker 1971 , bono et al .",
    "1997a ) , as given by    @xmath29 @xmath30    where luminosity @xmath11 and mass @xmath18 are in solar units .",
    "according to our models , the period of fo pulsators can be `` fundamentalized '' as log@xmath31log@xmath32 @xmath4 0.13 , on average , or with the more punctual relation log@xmath33=0.147 + 1.033log@xmath32 , neglecting the weak dependence on mass and luminosity which plays a significant role only when dealing with double mode pulsators .",
    "the natural outcome of the pulsation equation in the observational plane is the period - magnitude - color ( @xmath34 ) relation in which the pulsation period , for any given mass , is correlated with the pulsator absolute magnitude and color . using @xmath35 static quantities data of m3 rr lyrae stars . as for the relations in other photometric bands",
    ", they can be requested to marcella@na.astro.it .",
    "] , linear interpolation through the results ( see fig .",
    "1 ) gives    @xmath36\\eqno(2a)\\ ] ] @xmath37,\\eqno(2b)\\ ] ]    according to the predicted @xmath34 relations , for a sample of rr lyrae stars at the same distance and with the same reddening , e.g. for variables in a given globular cluster with no differential reddening , one could estimate the mass range spanned by the variables with an uncertainty lower than 2% , once periods and static colors are firmly known .",
    "if the cluster distance modulus and reddening are independently determined , then the mass absolute values can be inferred too .",
    "alternatively , once period and color are measured , the relations can be used to get the distance to individual rr lyrae stars with known mass and reddening .",
    "let us now consider the quite plain correlation between the absolute magnitude in a given @xmath38-band and luminosity , @xmath392.5log@xmath11+@xmath40 , where the bolometric correction @xmath40 depends on the star effective temperature , mass and luminosity . since also the pulsation period is governed [ see eqs .",
    "( 1a ) and ( 1b ) ] by the effective temperature , mass and luminosity , the absolute magnitude @xmath24 of radial pulsating stars is expected to be a function of mass , luminosity and period .",
    "it is obvious that the dependence of @xmath24 on mass , luminosity and period is governed by the dependence of @xmath40 on the effective temperature .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "2 ( symbols as in fig .",
    "1 ) the quite different dependence of visual and near - infrared static absolute magnitudes on the pulsation period . for",
    "any given mass and luminosity , an increase of @xmath21 yields shorter periods , while @xmath7 becomes slowly brighter and @xmath41 significantly fainter .",
    "on the other hand , if increasing the luminosity at constant mass and effective temperature , the period increases and both @xmath7 and @xmath41 become brighter . in summary , one has a sort of @xmath42 ( see the arrows in the lower panel in fig .",
    "2 ) between the luminosity and effective temperature effects on @xmath41 . as a result , for fixed period , @xmath7 depends mainly on luminosity , with a negligible dependence on the mass , whereas @xmath41 shows small but non negligible variations both with luminosity and mass ( see also bono et al . 2001 , 2003 ) .",
    "according to present models , the predicted period - magnitude relations in the visual ( @xmath43 ) and near - infrared bandpass ( @xmath44 ) are    @xmath45 @xmath46    and    @xmath47 @xmath48 the importance of the rr lyrae near - infrared @xmath44 relation to get accurate distances to globular clusters has already been discussed by several authors ( see bono et al .",
    "2001 and references therein ) and it will not be discussed further .",
    "it is enough to mention that near - infrared magnitudes are very little affected by reddening and that adopting for the rr lyrae stars in a given globular cluster , that is for variables at constant age and metal content , a luminosity dispersion of @xmath49 log@xmath50 0.06 and a mass spread , decreasing with increasing the metal content .",
    "] of @xmath63% , yields a dispersion @xmath51 0.17 mag and @xmath52 0.05 mag , at fixed period .",
    "all the relations described in the previous section originate from the pulsation equation which formally fixes the pulsation period for any given combination of the entry parameters ( @xmath18 , @xmath11 , @xmath21 ) . however , it is well known that radial pulsation occurs in a quite well - defined region of the hr diagram , the so - named `` instability strip '' , that depends on the type of pulsation and the intrinsic parameters of pulsators . in simple words , pulsation does not occur for any combination of @xmath53 and @xmath21 . for each given mass and luminosity",
    "there is a maximum and minimum effective temperature for the onset of either fundamental and first - overtone pulsation .    as already known , the data in tables 1 and 2 , as those presented in previous papers ( see , e.g. , bono , caputo & marconi 1995a , bono et al .",
    "1997a , b , caputo et al . 2000 , bono et al . 2002 and references therein ) show that , for fixed mass and luminosity , fo pulsators are generally bluer than f pulsators , in full agreement with the observed behavior of @xmath54-type and @xmath55-type rr lyrae stars .",
    "this yields that the first - overtone blue edge ( fobe ) and the fundamental red edge ( fre ) can be taken as limits of the whole instability strip .",
    "moreover , the models show that the fundamental pulsation blue edge ( fbe ) is generally bluer than the first - overtone red edge ( fore ) , suggesting that both the pulsation modes can be stable in a middle region of the instability region .",
    "such a result supports the hypothesis that the transition between @xmath55 and @xmath54 type rr lyrae stars may occur along different transitions ( fbe or fore ) , as well as that a hysteresis mechanism , as earlier suggested by van albada & baker ( 1973 ) , could explain the oosterhoff dichotomy ( see , e.g. , bono et al .",
    "1995a , bono et al .",
    "1997a for details ) .",
    "given the steps of 100 k in our computations , we adopt as edges of the pulsation region the effective temperature of the bluest fo model and of the reddest f model , increased and decreased by 50k , respectively .",
    "then , linear interpolation to all the data with @xmath0=0.001 and @xmath5=1.5 gives the following relations    @xmath56 @xmath57    where the uncertainties include the intrinsic uncertainty of @xmath650k on the fobe and fre temperatures .    before proceeding ,",
    "it is worth mentioning that a further source of uncertainty on the pulsation limits is due to the efficiency of convection in the star external layers . as the depth of convection increases from high to low effective temperature , and",
    "the effect of convection is to quench pulsation , we expect that varying the value of the mixing length parameter will modify the red edge of the instability strip by a larger amount with respect to the blue edge .",
    "model computations made with @xmath5=2.0 show that , at constant mass and luminosity , the fobe temperature decreases by @xmath4 100 k , whereas those at fbe and fre increase by @xmath4 100 k and @xmath4 300 k , respectively . as a consequence , at @xmath5=2.0 the zero - point in eq .",
    "( 5 ) and eq . ( 6 ) varies by @xmath80.006 and + 0.020 , respectively .",

    "2000 ) is the location of the pulsation theoretical edges in the magnitude - period and color - period diagrams . from present models at @xmath0=0.001 and @xmath5=1.5 , and adopting cgka , b atmosphere models , we derive    @xmath58 @xmath59    and    @xmath60^{fobe}=0.25(\\pm 0.02)-0.10\\log m+0.10\\log p^{fo}\\eqno(9)\\ ] ] @xmath60^{fre}=0.48(\\pm 0.03)-0.06\\log m+0.27\\log p^f\\eqno(10)\\ ] ]    where the uncertainties include the intrinsic @xmath650 k uncertainty on the fobe and fre temperatures . as a consequence of the above mentioned effects of a larger mixing - length parameter on the fobe and fre effective temperatures , adopting @xmath5=2.0 the zero - point in eq .",

    "( 9 ) and eq . (",
    "10 ) by @xmath4 + 0.02 mag and @xmath610.06 mag , respectively .",
    "we have already mentioned that the non - linear approach supplies important clues on a further observable : the pulsation amplitude . a glance at the data in table 1 and table 2 ( see also bono et al .",
    "1997a ) shows that , for fixed mass and luminosity , there is a direct correlation between fundamental amplitude and effective temperature : the amplitude increases when moving from the red to the blue limit for fundamental pulsation , that is as the period decreases . as for fo pulsators , they show a characteristic `` bell '' shaped distribution , with the maximum amplitude attained in the middle of the first - overtone region . as a whole , these theoretical features appear consistent with observed rr lyrae period - amplitude diagrams , usually named `` bailey diagrams '' after their inventor ( bailey 1899 , 1902 ) .    taking advantage of the quite linear correlation between fundamental amplitude and period ( logarithmic scale ) , we show in the left panel of fig .",
    "3 the @xmath62-log@xmath22 distribution of f pulsators at @xmath5=1.5 and different mass and luminosity ( symbols as in fig .",
    "1 ) . one has that , for fixed period , the amplitude decreases as the luminosity decreases or , by a rather small amount , as the mass increases . as a whole",
    ", we show in the right panel in fig .",
    "3 that all the results with @xmath5=1.5 ( filled circles ) can be approximated with the linear relation ( solid line )    @xmath63    however , we wish to remark that the fundamental pulsation amplitude is not `` @xmath64 '' by the absolute value of the effective temperature , but it depends on the `` @xmath65 '' location of the pulsator with respect to the red limit ( where vanishing amplitudes are attained ) and blue limit ( where the amplitude reaches it maximum value ) of fundamental pulsation ( see also bono et al .",
    "1997a ) . as a matter of example , the visual amplitude of the 0.65@xmath16 pulsator with @xmath21=6500 k increases from @xmath62=0.77 to 1.05 mag as the luminosity increases from log@xmath66=1.51 to 1.72 .",
    "it follows that the above described effects of a larger mixing - length parameter on the effective temperature of the fundamental pulsation limits will modify both the zero - point and the slope of the predicted period - magnitude - amplitude ( @xmath67 ) relation . as a fact , the right panel in fig .",
    "3 shows that the results with @xmath5=2.0 ( open circles ) can be approximated as ( dotted line )    @xmath68    closing this section on the pulsation amplitude , we present in the left panel in fig .",
    "4 the relation between visual amplitude @xmath62 and static @xmath35 color for f pulsators with @xmath5=1.5 ( symbols as in fig .",
    "1 ) . one derives that , at least in the explored range of mass and luminosity , all the results can be approximated with a common color - amplitude ( @xmath69 ) relation , as given by ( see the solid line in the right panel )    @xmath70    however , for the reasons above discussed , also the @xmath69 relation turns out to depend on the adopted mixing - length parameter , becoming    @xmath71    at @xmath5=2.0 ( see the dotted line in the right panel ) .    according to the predicted @xmath69 relation ,",
    "the intrinsic @xmath35 color of individual pulsators can be estimated within @xmath60.02 mag , which means a similar accuracy in the knowledge of the reddening @xmath72 and a determination of the visual extinction correction a(v ) within @xmath73 0.06 mag .",
    "this might be of particular relevance in the case of rr lyrae variables in globular clusters , or stellar fields , with highly differential reddening .",
    "all the relations presented so far , although involving observable quantities such as magnitude and color , can not be straightaway applied to observed rr lyrae variables because they hold for @xmath13 values whereas empirical measurements refer to quantities averaged over the pulsation cycle",
    ".    from the data listed in table 1 one finds that the synthetic mean magnitudes ( @xmath24 ) of fundamental pulsators , as derived averaging the magnitude over the cycle , are fainter than the corresponding static values with a discrepancy increasing as the pulsation amplitude increases .",
    "the key element governing such a behavior is the overall morphology of the light curve in the sense that the difference between static and mean magnitudes increases from symmetric ( low amplitude ) to asymmetric ( high amplitude ) light curves , namely moving from the red to the blue fundamental edge ( see also bono , caputo , stellingwerf 1995b ) .",
    "since at fixed effective temperature the amplitude decreases from blue to visual to infrared , the difference between static and mean values for @xmath74 magnitudes is almost negligible , whereas @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 differ from the corresponding static values up to @xmath4 0.18 mag , @xmath4 0.14 mag , and @xmath4 0.08 mag , respectively , at @xmath62=1.6 mag . as for fo pulsators ( data in table 2 ) ,",
    "the discrepancy is less pronounced , given their low - amplitude and quite symmetric light curves .",
    "note that present synthetic magnitudes confirm previous @xmath17 results inferred by bono et al .",
    "( 1995b ) from a preliminary set of pulsating models with @xmath0=0.001 , but adopting @xmath1=0.30 , older opacity tables ( cox & tabor 1976 ) and kurucz ( 1992 ) stellar atmosphere models .    concerning the intensity - averaged magnitudes @xmath23 , data in table 1 and table 2 confirm that they are quite close to the static values , except for models with very large amplitude .    in fig .",
    "5 we show the synthetic visual magnitudes for f and fo pulsators , by plotting the discrepancy between static and mean values , as well as the internal difference between the two means , as a function of the visual amplitude @xmath62 .",
    "it is quite relevant to notice that the predicted differences @xmath78 , as well as the corresponding rather insignificant amounts inferred from table 1 and table 2 for the @xmath74-band , are in close agreement with observed differences @xmath79 and @xmath80 , as reported in previous studies on rr lyrae stars ( e.g. fernley 1993 ) .    as for the mean colors",
    "@xmath81 which are usually estimated using either @xmath82 or @xmath83 , since most of empirical work on rr lyrae stars refers to @xmath84 and @xmath85 magnitude , we show in fig .",
    "6 the predicted discrepancy between static and mean @xmath86 color , as well as the difference between the two means @xmath87 and @xmath88 . at variance with the behavior shown in fig . 5",
    ", one has that the @xmath87 color is redder , whereas @xmath88 is bluer , than the static color .",
    "the evidence for a positive difference between predicted @xmath87 and @xmath88 , with an amount that increases with @xmath62 , agrees with quite well settled observed trends ( see , e.g. liu & janes 1990 ; storm , carney & beck 1991 ; carney et al .",
    "1992 , caputo et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "according to the data presented in fig . 5 and fig . 6 ,",
    "mean magnitudes and colors can be corrected for the amplitude effect to get static values ( see also bono et al .",
    "however , given the different behavior of @xmath89 and @xmath90 with the amplitude , we find that static @xmath35 magnitudes can be directly estimated when both the mean quantities are measured . in particular , either for f and fo pulsators , we derive that static @xmath35 values ( see table 2 for the other bands ) can be approximated as    @xmath91 @xmath92 + 0.497[<m_b>-<m_v>]\\eqno(16)\\ ] ]    with an intrinsic uncertainty of @xmath60.01 mag .",
    "at the beginning of this paper we mentioned that the `` theoretical route '' to the calibration of the @xmath7(rr ) versus [ fe / h ] relation , as inferred by hb evolutionary models , suggests brighter magnitudes than empirical estimates , at fixed [ fe / h ] . unfortunately , even the amount of this over - luminosity is still matter of controversy .    for",
    "the sake of the following discussion , let us briefly summarize the basic ingredients which are needed for a reliable `` theoretical route '' :    1 .",
    "trustworthy hb models computed with the most recent updating of the relevant physics .",
    "2 .   synthetic hb simulations ( shb ) in order to estimate the evolutionary effects and the role of different hb populations . 3 .   realistic bolometric corrections and color - temperature transformations .",
    "4 .   appropriate scaling between the metallicity @xmath0 and the iron - to - hydrogen content [ fe / h ] .",
    "such a `` shopping list '' should help the common reader to understand the main reasons for the rather different theoretical predictions on the @xmath7(rr)-[fe / h ] relation , as presented in the recent literature ( see caputo et al .",
    "2000 and references therein ) .",
    "it is known that , due to somehow different input physics , current updated hb models still provide slightly different luminosity values ( see , e.g. , castellani 2003 ) .",
    "moreover , different bolometric corrections , as well as different assumptions concerning the value of the overabundance of @xmath12-elements with respect to iron , are used by the various researchers .",
    "we add that sometimes , in order to account for the luminosity of actual ( evolved ) pulsators , the zero age horizontal branch ( zahb ) luminosity at the rr lyrae instability strip is artificially increased , by a fixed quantity or as a function of metallicity , instead of making use of shb results .",
    "within such a complex scenario , it is of primary importance to carefully investigate into current uncertainties of hb models .",
    "this will be done in the following section where the hb models at @xmath0=0.001 ( [ @xmath12/fe=0 ] ) computed by cassisi et al .",
    "( 2003 , in preparation , hereafter c03 ) , are compared with vdb results .      according to a very common procedure",
    ", zahb stars are investigated starting from stellar structures with the same mass of the he core and the same chemical composition of the stellar envelope as in the rg progenitor at the he ignition , but with an increased abundance of carbon in the he core by about 5% by mass as a result of the flash .",
    "the mass of the h - rich envelope and , thus , the total mass of the model are regarded as a free parameter governed by the unknown amount of mass loss . a reliable zahb model is eventually obtained by evolving such an initial structure for about 1 myr to allow equilibrium of cno elements in the h burning shell ( see , e.g. , caputo , castellani & wood 1978 , caputo , castellani & tornambe 1978 , castellani , chieffi & pulone 1991 ) .",
    "the c03 horizontal branch models used in this paper implement previous calculations presented by cassisi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and caputo & cassisi ( 2002 ) and will not discussed here . of importance",
    "is that both c03 and vdb models adopt quite similar values for the mixing length parameter ( @xmath5=2.0 and 1.9 , respectively ) , no helium and heavy element diffusion , and can be taken as representative of the range in _ absolute magnitude _ spanned by recent hb evolutionary calculations with updated input physics .",
    "figure 7 shows the mass and luminosity of zahb models near the rr lyrae instability strip plotted as a function of the effective temperature . as for the vdb models ,",
    "note that they have the same @xmath93 metallicity @xmath0=0.001 , although referring to different chemical mixtures ( [ @xmath12/fe]=0 , [ fe / h]=@xmath81.31 and [ @xmath12/fe]=0.3 , [ fe / h]=@xmath81.54 ) .    from the comparison of models at fixed effective temperature , one finds evidence for three main points :    1 .",

    "on the other hand , if the distance modulus is slightly decreased ( @xmath110=15.0 mag ) in order to leave no @xmath54-type variables in the hot stable region , then a few @xmath55-type variables would have slightly longer period than the predicted fre .",
    "as far a decrease of the adopted mixing - length parameter is concerned , one has to consider that at @xmath5=1.5 the predicted edges becomes brighter by 0.05 mag ( fobe ) and fainter than 0.14 mag ( fre ) , at constant period .",
    "as a consequence , a distance modulus @xmath110=15.05 mag is the right value to fit the observed distribution of @xmath54-type variables , whereas @xmath55-type variables would require @xmath110=14.90 mag .",

    "one can conclude that the assumption @xmath5=1.5 yields rather discordant results , while a quite close agreement among the various approaches is reached with @xmath5=2.0 .",
    "however , we have shown in fig . 15 that adopting such a large value of the mixing - length parameter the predicted fre fully accounts for the observed colors of @xmath55-type variables , whereas the predicted fobe is too red in comparison with the observed colors of @xmath54-type variables . on this issue , it seems interesting to mention a recent paper by bono , castellani & marconi ( 2002 ) dealing with the comparison",
    "of observed light curves of bump cepheids in the large magellanic cloud with theoretical predictions . in that paper",
    "it is shown that for short - period variables a nice agreement is attained with @xmath5=1.5 , whereas long - period cepheids , which are located close to the red edge of the pulsation region , require a higher value ( @xmath5=1.8 ) , suggesting that the mixing - length parameter increases when the effective temperature decreases , and the convective layer becomes thicker .",
    "eventually , we adopt that the mixing - length parameter increases from fobe ( @xmath5=1.5 ) to fre ( @xmath5=2.0 ) . as a result",
    ", we derive that the _ pulsational _ distance modulus of m3 , as given by the weighted mean over the data listed in table 4 , is @xmath110=15.07@xmath60.05 mag , at least adopting rr lyrae masses from c03 hb models and cgka , b bolometric corrections .",
    "in the previous section we have presented evidence that theoretical relations based on pulsating models with @xmath115 , collated with information on the average mass of rr lyrae stars inferred by shb computations , provide a @xmath3 route to accurate distance determinations for globular clusters with well populated horizontal branch . in particular , adopting @xmath103=0.67@xmath60.02@xmath16 from shb calculations based on c03 hb models , we derived predictions for fundamental ( f ) or first - overtone ( fo ) rr lyrae stars in globular clusters with ( b - r)/(b+v+r ) ratio from @xmath4 + 0.55 to @xmath1040.45 .    the comparison with rr lyrae stars in m3 ( @xmath35 data by corwin & carney 2001 , @xmath74 data by longmore et al . 1990 ) discloses that the pulsating models support the large value of the mixing - length parameter ( @xmath5=1.9 - 2.0 ) adopted in updated evolutionary computations to fit observed red giant branches , even though they suggest that the value of such a parameter may increase from the blue to the red edge of the instability region .",
    "on this basis , adopting cgka , b bolometric corrections and color - transformations , we eventually get a _",
    "pulsational _ distance modulus @xmath110(m3)=15.07@xmath60.05 mag , as given by the weighted mean over the results provided by the different approaches ( see table 4 ) .    in order to compare this result with the classical _ evolutionary route _",
    ", let us go back to fig . 10 .",
    "there , we have shown that the lower envelope of the absolute magnitudes of synthetic pulsators based on c03 hb models is at @xmath105=0.55 mag .",
    "on the other hand , we show in fig .",
    "20 that the actual lower envelope for the m3 variables is @xmath85=15.7 mag ( solid line ) , thus providing an _ evolutionary _ distance modulus @xmath110=15.15 mag which is 0.08@xmath60.05 mag longer than the _ pulsational _ value .",
    "before discussing such a small but equally disturbing discrepancy between the pulsational and evolutionary approach , let us mark that it _ does not depend on the adopted hb models , nor on the adopted bolometric correction_. in fact , were the vdb models used , but maintaining cgka , b bolometric corrections , then the average mass of rr lyrae pulsators would be 0.65@xmath60.02@xmath16 ( point 2 in sect .",
    "3.1 ) , and consequently the distance modulus based on @xmath34 , @xmath67 and @xmath44 relations should be decreased by @xmath4 0.02 mag , on average . on the other hand , the predicted fobe and fre magnitudes , at fixed period , increases by 0.03 mag ( see fig .",
    "11 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the pulsational distance modulus of m3 becomes @xmath110=15.05@xmath60.05 mag .",
    "since the lower envelope of the vdb - like pulsators is at @xmath105=0.58 mag ( see fig .",
    "11 ) , one derives again that the pulsational approach yields a distance modulus larger by 0.07@xmath60.05 mag with respect to the evolutionary predictions .    as for the effects of different bolometric corrections , it is worth mentioning that there is a significant difference between cgka , b values and those adopted in vdb models , in the sense that the former give absolute magnitudes brighter by @xmath4 0.05 - 0.06 mag , at fixed luminosity and effective temperature .",
    "however , such a difference obviously modifies the absolute magnitudes , and then the derived distance modulus , but leaves unvaried relative values , mainly the above discrepancy between pulsational and evolutionary distance moduli .    in summary ,",
    "the distance modulus of m3 , as based on pulsational models and mass constrained by stellar evolution theory , ranges from 15.00 mag ( vdb computations and bolometric corrections ) to 15.05 mag ( vdb computations and cgka , b bolometric corrections ) to 15.07 mag ( c03 computations and cgka , b bolometric corrections ) , all with a total error of @xmath6 0.05 mag .",
    "it follows that recent hb computations with updated physics do yield consistent results , _ provided that similar bolometric corrections are used_. conversely , current uncertainty on the @xmath116 scale appears still too large , requiring some firm solutions .    independently of the adopted @xmath116 correction , the pulsational approach would suggest that current updated hb models are over - luminous by 0.08@xmath60.05 mag .",
    "however , a clear way to reduce the hb luminosity is offered by the diffusion of helium and metals . as shown by cassisi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , if element diffusion is properly taken into account , then the luminosity of hb models at the rr lyrae gap decreases by 0.03 - 0.04 mag , reducing the discrepancy between pulsational and evolutionary distances to @xmath4 1@xmath117 .",

    "<S> we present predicted relations connecting pulsational ( period and amplitude of pulsation ) and evolutionary ( mass , absolute magnitude and color ) parameters , as based on a wide set of convective pulsating models of rr lyrae stars with @xmath0=0.001 , @xmath1=0.24 and mass and luminosity suitable for the `` old '' ( age @xmath2 8 gyr ) variables observed in globular clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the relations are collated with sound constraints on the mass of pulsators , as inferred from up - to - date evolutionary models of horizontal branch stars , in order to provide a self - consistent theoretical framework for the analysis of observed variables . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical predictions are tested through a detailed comparison with measurements of rr lyrae stars in the globular cluster m3 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the predicted relations satisfy a variety of observed data , thus providing a @xmath3 route to the determination of accurate distances to rr lyrae - rich globular clusters with intermediate metal content . </S>",
    "<S> we show that current uncertainties on the intrinsic luminosity of up - to - date horizontal branch models , as due to the input physics used in the computations by the different authors , have a quite low influence ( @xmath4 0.02 - 0.03 mag ) on the pulsational distance modulus . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the different bolometric corrections adopted to convert bolometric luminosity into absolute magnitude is of the order of @xmath4 0.05 - 0.06 mag . </S>",
    "<S> the pulsation models are also used to perform some valuable tests on the physics adopted in current stellar evolution computations . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the constraints inferred by pulsation theory support the large value of the mixing - length parameter ( @xmath5=1.9 - 2.0 ) adopted to fit observed red giant branches , but , at the same time , they would yield that the luminosity of the horizontal branch updated models is too bright by @xmath4 0.08@xmath60.05 mag , if helium and metal diffusion is neglected . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , if element diffusion is properly taken into account , then there is a marginal discrepancy of @xmath4 0.04@xmath60.05 mag between evolutionary and pulsational predictions . </S>"
