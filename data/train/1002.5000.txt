    "a graph is a pair @xmath0 consisting of a countable set of _ vertices _ @xmath1 together with a set @xmath2 of _",

    "there is another issue of importance to us , _ amenability_. a definition in line with our subject matter here goes as follows :    a discrete group @xmath28 is called _ amenable _ , if there is a _ flner sequence _ ,",
    "i.e. , a sequence @xmath110 of finite subsets which exhausts @xmath28 with the property that for every finite @xmath111 : @xmath112 where @xmath113 denotes the symmetric difference of two sets @xmath45 and @xmath114 .    there is quite a number of different equivalent characterisations of amenability .",
    "the notion goes back to john von neumann @xcite . in its original form he required the existence of a _",
    "mean _ on @xmath115 , i.e. , a positive , normed , @xmath28-invariant functional .",
    "the defining property of a flner sequence is that the volume of the boundary of @xmath116 becomes small with respect to the volume of @xmath116 itself as @xmath117 .",
    "boundary as a topological term is of no use here ; instead , thinking of the associated cayley graph , @xmath118 can be thought of as a neighborhood around @xmath116 ( at least for @xmath119 containing the identity ) and so @xmath120 represents the volume of a boundary layer around @xmath116 .",
    "thinking of @xmath119 as the ball @xmath121 makes this picture quite suggestive .",
    "discrete groups of subexponential growth are amenable .",
    "the _ lamplighter groups _ ( see below ) are amenable but not of subexponential growth .",
    "consequently , growth does not determine amenability .",
    "the standard example of a nonamenable group is the free group on two generators .",
    "let us end this subsection with the example we already referred to above :    fix @xmath122 . the _ wreath product _",
    "@xmath123 is the set @xmath124 @xmath125 and is called the lamplighter group .",
    "it is amenable , see @xcite .",
    "this section contains the heart of the matter of the present survey . after introducing percolation",
    ", we begin discussing the relevant properties of the random operators associated with percolation subgraphs .",
    "the central notion is the _ integrated density of states _",
    ", a real - valued function .",
    "we then explain a number of results on the asymptotic behaviour of this function and how methods from analysis , geometry of groups , graph theory and probability are used to derive these results .",
    "percolation is a probabilistic concept with a wide range of applications , usually related to some notion of _ conductivity _ or _",
    "connectedness_. its importance in ( statistical ) physics lies in the fact that , despite its simplicity , percolation yet exposes a phase transition .",
    "the mathematical origin of percolation can be traced back to a question of broadbent that was taken up in two fundamental papers by broadbent and hammersley in 1957 @xcite .",
    "percolation theory still has an impressive list of easy - to - state open problems to offer , some with well established numerical data and conjectures based on physical reasoning .",
    "we refer to @xcite for standard references concerning the mathematics , as well as kesten s recent article in the notices of the ams @xcite .    mathematically speaking , and presented in accordance with our subject matter here , percolation theory deals with random subgraphs of a given graph @xmath0 that is assumed to be infinite and connected .",
    "a good and important example is the @xmath36-dimensional lattice graph @xmath37 , the particular case @xmath126 being very special , however .",
    "there are two different but related random procedures to delete edges and vertices from @xmath20 , called _",
    "site percolation _ and _ bond percolation_. in both cases , everything will depend upon one parameter @xmath127 $ ] that gives the probability of keeping vertices or edges , respectively .",
    "let us start to describe _",
    "site percolation_. we consider the infinite product @xmath128 as probability space with elementary events @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and a product bernoulli measure @xmath131 that formalizes the following random procedure .",
    "independently for all vertices ( also called _ sites _ in this context ) of @xmath1 , we delete the vertex @xmath5 from the graph with probability @xmath132 , along with all edges adjacent to @xmath5 .",
    "this corresponds to the event @xmath133 , and we call the site @xmath5 _ closed_. on the other hand , we keep the vertex @xmath5 and its adjacent edges in the graph with probability @xmath134 .",
    "this corresponds to the event @xmath135 , in which case we speak of an _ open _ site .",
    "every possible realisation or configuration is given by exactly one element @xmath136 , and the measure @xmath137 above governs the statistics according to the rule we just mentioned .",
    "note that we omit the superscript in the notation of the product measure .",
    "the graph we just described is illustrated in figure 3 and formally defined by @xmath138 , where @xmath139 i.e.  the subgraph of @xmath20 induced by @xmath140 .",
    "note that for @xmath141 the graph @xmath142 is empty with probability @xmath143 and for @xmath144 we get @xmath145 with probability 1 .",
    "the second variant , _ bond percolation _ , works quite similarly : @xmath148 leading to the subgraph @xmath138 with @xmath149 it amounts to deleting edges ( also called _",
    "bonds _ in this context ) with probability @xmath132 , independently of each other .",
    "the choice @xmath150 is merely a convention .",
    "other authors keep only those vertices that are adjacent to some edge .    in both site and bond percolation ,",
    "the issue is the connectedness of the so - obtained random subgraphs .",
    "note that the realisations @xmath151 themselves do not depend upon @xmath134 , while assertions concerning the probability of certain events or the stochastic expectation of random variables constructed from the subgraphs surely do .",
    "a typical question is whether the cluster @xmath15 that contains vertex @xmath35 is finite in the subgraph @xmath142 for @xmath131-almost all @xmath152 or whether it is infinite with non - zero probability . in the latter case one",
    "says that percolation occurs .",
    "let us assume from now on that @xmath20 is quasi - transitive , so that the above question will have an answer that is independent of @xmath5 .",
    "the _ percolation threshold _ or _ critical probability _ is then defined as @xmath153 \\big|\\ ; { \\mathbb{p}}_p [ |c_x|=\\infty ] = 0\\big\\ } .\\ ] ] it is independent of @xmath5 since , globally , @xmath20 looks the same everywhere , cf .  , and @xmath131 is a product measure consisting of identical factors . a related critical value is given by @xmath154 \\big| \\ ; { \\mathbb{e}}_p [ |c_x| ] < \\infty \\big\\ } , \\ ] ] and",
    "it is clear that @xmath155 . here",
    ", @xmath156 stands for the expectation on the probability space @xmath157 .",
    "the equality of these two critical values is often dubbed _",
    "sharpness of the phase transition _ , and we write @xmath158 in this case for _ the _ critical probability . clearly , sharpness of the transition is a desirable property , as both @xmath159 and @xmath160 represent two equally reasonable ways to distinguish a phase with @xmath131-almost surely only finite clusters , the _ subcritical _ or _ non - percolating _ phase , from a phase where there exists an infinite cluster with probability one , the _ supercritical _ or _ percolating _ phase . apart from that ,",
    "sharpness of the phase transition has been used as an important ingredient in the proof of kesten s classical result that @xmath161 for bond percolation on the 2-dimensional integer lattice @xmath146 .",
    "together with estimates known for @xmath162 , it gives that the expectation of the cluster size decays exponentially , i.e. , @xmath163 with some constant @xmath164 for all @xmath165 .",
    "this fact is also heavily used in some proofs of lifshits tails for percolation subgraphs , see below .",
    "fundamental papers that settle sharpness of the phase transition for lattices and certain quasi - transitive percolation models are @xcite .",
    "recent results valid for all quasi - transitive graphs can be found in @xcite together with a discussion of the generality of earlier literature .",
    "it is expected that sharpness of the phase transition also holds for percolation on more general well - behaved graphs even without quasi - transitivity .",
    "the celebrated penrose tiling gives rise to such a graph without quasi - transitivity but some form of aperiodic order .",
    "a result analogous to thm .",
    "[ sharp ] was proven for the penrose tiling in @xcite .",
    "the general case of graphs with aperiodic order has not yet been settled .",
    "we refer to @xcite for partial results in this direction .",
    "the study of the random family @xmath169 of laplacians on percolation graphs was proposed by de gennes @xcite and often runs under the header quantum percolation in physics . in this paper",
    "we focus on the _ integrated density of states _ ( ids ) , also called _ spectral distribution function _ , of this family of operators .    in general",
    ", the ids is the distribution function of a ( not necessarily finite ) measure on @xmath170 that is meant to describe the density of spectral values of a given self - adjoint operator . in the cases of interest to us here , the underlying hilbert space is @xmath67 , with @xmath1 being the countable vertex set of some graph . in this situation",
    "the ids is even the distribution function of a probability measure on @xmath170 , as we shall see . before giving the rigorous definition that applies in this setting",
    ", let us first start with a discussion at a heuristic level . for elliptic operators acting on functions on some infinite configuration space @xmath1 with a periodic geometric structure , one typically does not have eigenvalues , but",
    "rather continuous spectrum .",
    "however , the restrictions of these operators to compact subsets @xmath171 of configuration space @xmath1 ( more precisely to @xmath172 , actually ) come with discrete spectrum .",
    "therefore , one can count eigenvalues , including their multiplicities .",
    "the idea of the ids is to calculate the number of eigenvalues per unit volume for an increasing sequence @xmath173 of compact subsets and take the limit . for this procedure to make sense",
    ", the operator has to be homogenous , at least on a statistical level .",
    "two situations are typical : firstly , a periodic operator , quite often the laplacian of a periodic geometry . and , secondly , an ergodic ( statistically homogenous ) random family of operators , in which case the above mentioned limit will exist with probability one .",
    "let @xmath174 be a self - adjoint operator in @xmath67 .",
    "an intuitive ansatz for the definition of the ids might be @xmath175 $ ] , @xmath176-\\infty , e]}(h)\\big]}{| f_n| }   = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty }   \\frac{\\sum_{x\\in f_{n } } \\langle \\delta_{x } , 1_{]-\\infty , e]}(h)\\delta_{x}\\rangle}{|f_{n}| } \\ ,   , \\ ] ] where @xmath177 is an appropriate sequence of finite sets exhausting @xmath1 . before we go on ,",
    "let us add some remarks on our notation in .",
    "in general ,",
    "we write @xmath178 for the indicator function of some set @xmath45 . above",
    ", @xmath179 is to be interpreted as the multiplication operator corresponding to the indicator function @xmath179 . in view of the functional calculus for self - adjoint operators we write @xmath180 for the spectral projection of @xmath174 associated to some borel set @xmath181 .",
    "finally , @xmath182 stands for the trace on @xmath67 and @xmath183 for the canonical basis vector that is one at vertex @xmath5 and zero everywhere else .",
    "as was already mentioned , a certain homogeneity property is necessary in order for the limit in to exist .",
    "a careful choice of the exhausting sequence is necessary , too . for",
    "amenable groups tempered flner sequences will do the job , as is ensured by a general ergodic theorem of lindenstrauss @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details in the present context and sum up the main points in the following definition and the subsequent results .",
    "[ ids - def ]",
    "let @xmath20 be a graph and let @xmath28 be an infinite group that acts quasi - transitively on @xmath20 .",

    "the next theorem establishes the connection between the heuristic picture displayed in and the preceding definition .",
    "the point here is the generality of the group involved . in the more conventional setting of random operators on euclidean space @xmath192 ( with the group action of @xmath85 ) , the equation is the celebrated _ pastur - shubin trace formula_.

    "interestingly , the ids links quite a number of different areas in mathematics : we started with an elementary operator theoretic point of view .",
    "if we rephrase the basic existence problem in the way that we regard the counting of eigenvalues as evaluating the trace of the corresponding eigenprojection , we arrive at the question , whether appropriate traces exist on certain operator algebras .",
    "typically , the operators we have in mind are intimately linked to some geometry , so that quantities derived from the ids play an important role in geometric analysis .",
    "an important example is the _ novikov - shubin invariant _ of order zero , which equals the _ van hove exponent _ in the mathematical physics language and will be discussed in our setting further below ; see @xcite and the oberwolfach report @xcite .",
    "another wellknown principle provides a link to stochastic processes and random walks : the laplace transform of @xmath196 is the return probability of a continuous time random walk on the graph ; details geared towards the applications we have in mind can be found in @xcite .",

    "in particular , if one had taken an expectation on the r.h.s .  of , one would have ended up with the very same expression in the macroscopic limit .",

    "it encodes all thermostatic properties of a corresponding gas of non - interacting particles . as an example we mention a systems of electrons in a solid , where this is a reasonable approximation in many situations .",
