    "there are numbers of deeply embedded young stellar objects ( ysos ) detected in x - ray , infrared , and radio wavelengths .",
    "in particular , high resolution radio interferometer observations have identified dust continuum sources , h regions , and radio jets driven by ysos ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .    among a number of high - mass yso candidates",
    ", a radio source  i ( orion source  i ) has the most outstanding characteristics .",
    "it has been thought to be a prototypical high - mass protostar candidate with a luminosity greater than 10@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "source  i is a driving source of a so - called low velocity ( 18  km  s@xmath3 ) bipolar outflow along the northeast - southwest ( ne - sw ) direction with a scale of 1000  au traced by the thermal sio lines @xcite . at the position of the central yso , vibrationally excited sio masers are detected , which is a quite rare case for star - forming regions @xcite .",
    "high resolution vlbi observations reveal that the sio masers trace a magneto - centrifugal disk wind from the surface of the circumstellar disk with 100  au scale @xcite .",
    "vibrationally excited molecular lines such as h@xmath4o , sio , co , and so at the excitation energies of 500 - 3500  k are also detected around source  i by the recent atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) observations suggesting a hot molecular gas in the rotating disk and base of the outflow @xcite .",
    "continuum emissions are detected from centimeter to submillimeter wavelengths up to 690  ghz ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for the latest review ) .",
    "recent high resolution observations with the very large array ( vla ) and alma resolve the structure of the continuum emission with the deconvolved size of @xmath5100  au scale @xcite . because the continuum source is elongated perpendicular to the low - velocity ne - sw outflow , the continuum emission is thought to trace an edge - on circumstellar disk rather than a radio jet",
    ". possible mechanism of the continuum emission is proposed such as thermal dust gray - body radiation , h@xmath1 free - free radiation , proton - electron free - free radiation , and their combination @xcite .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of source  i shows a power - law function with an index of 2 below 350  ghz while it becomes slightly steeper at higher frequency than 350  ghz @xcite .",
    "such a characteristics along with the lack of turnover in the sed @xcite strongly implies the optically thick thermal dust emission @xcite .",
    "the brightness temperature of 500  k in the submillimeter bands also support an explanation via the thermal dust emission @xcite .    in this letter , we present the new continuum measurement results with alma at band  8 ( 430  ghz , 460  ghz , and 490  ghz ) at a resolution of 100  mas or 40  au .",
    "our data achieve the highest spatial resolution in the recent millimeter / submillimeter observations except that from vla @xcite , and hence , they are helpful to confirm the recent observational results @xcite .",

    "our results support the conclusions obtained from the latest alma observations at 350  ghz and 660  ghz @xcite .",
    "the present newer and higher resolution data could put better constraints on the width of the minor axis , and establish an improved lower limit on the brightness temperature .",
    "observations were carried out in 2015 with alma as one of the science projects in cycle  2 ( 2013.1.00048 ) .",

    "the alma correlator provided the four spectral windows with the total bandwidth of 1875  mhz and 937.5  mhz for two windows each .",
    "the channel spacings of spectrometers were 976.562  khz and 488.281  khz for the spectral windows with the 1875  mhz and 937.5  mhz bandwidths , respectively .",
    "dual polarization data were obtained simultaneously for all the frequency bands .    the data were calibrated and imaged with the common astronomy software applications ( casa ) package .",
    "we employed the calibrated data delivered by the east - asia alma regional center ( ea - arc ) .",
    "first , visibility data were separated into spectral lines and continuum emissions by setting the line free channels with the casa task .",
    "next , both phase and amplitude self - calibration was done with the continuum emission of source  i by integrating over all the channels using casa tasks and . because of calibration problems in the delivered data due to the large atmospheric opacity around 487  ghz , we used only three spectral windows among four alma basebands to make a continuum image at 490  ghz . for the intensity maps of the continuum emissions , we employed the visibility data with the uv distance longer than 400  k@xmath6 to resolve out extended emission components @xcite .",
    "the procedure provides an angular resolution of @xmath5100  mas , corresponding to the linear resolution of 40  au at the distance to orion  kl .",
    "we note that the observed peak positions of the continuum emissions at different frequencies are offset from each others as summarized in table [ tab - cont ] .",
    "it is probably due to astrometric calibration errors in the alma observations / data analysis .",
    "thus , all the maps are registered based on the continuum peak positions , and we will not discuss about absolute position of each emission .",

    "the structure is elongated along the nw - se direction , which is perpendicular to the low - velocity ne - sw bipolar outflow .",

    "recent alma observations of continuum emissions at 350  ghz and 660  ghz show the optically thick spectral energy distribution ( sed ) with a power - law index of 2.0 @xcite .",
    "our measured flux densities agrees well with those of their interpolation .",
    "because we used only visibilities with the longer baseline length than 400  k@xmath6 in the imaging , some of the emission could be resolved out . using the casa task",
    ", we simulated the alma imaging of a gaussian source model with the size of 220  mas@xmath050  mas and total flux density of 1  jy .",
    "when we assume the same uv coverage of our observation at 460  ghz with a uniform weighting of only @xmath7400  k@xmath6 data , the derived flux density and deconvolved source size , 0.9996  jy and 220.0  mas@xmath049.8  mas can reconstruct the model parameters .",
    "thus , our imaging results provide reliable source size and flux density .    we reanalyze the sed by employing our new data at 460  ghz band .",
    "the same fitting procedures are applied to the present data as described in @xcite .",
    "if there are more than two observed results previously reported at the same frequency band , we only employ the flux density data with the highest spatial resolution at each band . for our alma band  8 results , we only use the 460  ghz data and do not include the 430  ghz and 490  ghz data in order not to put too much weight for our band  8 data in the fitting .",
    "when all the data from 6 to 660  ghz are used in the fitting as shown in figure [ fig - sed](a ) , the best fit power - law sed , @xmath8 , has an spectral index @xmath9 of 1.86@xmath100.05 .",
    "compared with the best fit sed , the black - body sed with the fixed index of 2.0 shows significant deviation at the lower frequency data below 10  ghz because of the excess emission from the free - free radiation as proposed by @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it may also suggest an unresolved spatial structure of inhomogeneous gas distribution or physical properties such as density / temperature distribution @xcite .    for comparison , we plot the sed at the frequency higher than 100  ghz in figure [ fig - sed](b )",
    ". we can not see a clear signature of a turnover in the sed that would suggest an optically thin h@xmath1 free - free or proton - electron free - free radiation @xcite . the best - fit sed model by using only the high frequencies from 230  ghz to 660  ghz gives the power - law index of 2.16@xmath100.06 .",
    "in all cases , the sed at our band  8 data is consistent with the optically thick black - body radiation .",
    "we note that the best - fit power - law index of 2.16 is marginally larger than 2.0 .",
    "this is consistent with the excess flux at higher frequency than 600  ghz where the dust emission has the larger source size or becomes hotter as already reported by @xcite .",
    "because the source structure is marginally resolved in the present observations , we can derive the brightness temperature of the continuum emission , as listed in table [ tab - cont ] .",
    "the brightness temperature of 700 - 800  k is slightly higher than that derived from the 350  ghz and 660  ghz continuum data of 500  k @xcite .",
    "it is bacause our higher resolution data can better constrain the source size , in particular for the minor axis of the edge - on disk . according to @xcite ,",
    "proton - electron free - free emission is unlikely to be an opacity source because of the lack of hydrogen recombination line and extremely large luminosity required for the optically thick sed .",
    "the optically thick h@xmath1 free - free radiation is also ruled out since unrealistically high density or large disk mass is necessary to satisfy the optically thick sed without a turnover @xcite .",
    "our new sed fitting with the beam averaged brightness temperature of 700 - 800  k agrees with their interpretation via the optically thick thermal dust emission @xcite .    nevertheless , there may be a smaller scale structure unresolved with the alma beam @xmath540  au which could have a higher brightness temperature . in fact , the higher spatial resolution data at 43  ghz observed with vla show the more compact structure than the present alma beam size with the higher brightness temperature of 1600  k @xcite .",
    "the excess flux densities below 43  ghz is attributed to a contribution from the hotter free - free radiation @xcite .",
    "if the actual disk size or the beam filling factor is smaller by a factor of two than that of the deconvolved size , the brightness temperature becomes higher than 1600  k observed with the vla . in this case",
    ", we can not fully rule out a possibility of the h@xmath1 free - free radiation as an opacity source of the emission . the hydrogen density to achieve the optically thick h@xmath1 free - free emission up to 660  ghz requires @xmath510@xmath11 - 10@xmath12  @xmath13 corresponding to a disk mass of 2@xmath14 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the highest resolution imaging that can be achieved with alma @xmath1510  au will be able to resolve a vertical and internal clumpy structure of this edge - on disk for the first time , which will be the key issue to understanding of the basic nature of source  i.    we would like to thank richard l. plambeck for valuable comments .",
