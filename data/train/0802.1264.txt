    "observations of wmap @xcite and supernova of type ia data @xcite have revealed that our universe is filled with an exotic dark energy apart from dark matter .",
    "the nature and composition of this energy is still an open problem but its dynamics is well understood i.e it causes an approximately exponential expansion of the universe ( see @xcite for recent reviews on dark energy ) .",
    "astrophysical data suggest that about two thirds of the critical energy density is stored in the dark energy component . for the equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath0",
    ", the fluid is called phantom energy ( pe ) .",
    "observations show that @xmath1 is constrained in the range @xmath2 @xcite , thus providing evidence of phantom energy in the universe .",
    "the pe violates all the energy conditions in all forms ( weak , null , strong or dominant ) .",
    "the phantom energy can cause some peculiar phenomena e.g. the existence of wormholes @xcite , infinite expansion of the universe in a finite time causing a big rip ( br ) and the destruction of all gravitationally bound structures including black holes @xcite .",
    "in particular , black holes will continuously lose mass and disappear near the br ( see @xcite for the opposite viewpoint ) .",
    "dark energy with bulk viscosity has a peculiar property to cause accelerated expansion of phantom type in the late evolution of the universe @xcite .",
    "it can also alleviate several cosmological puzzles like cosmic age problem @xcite , coincidence problem @xcite and phantom crossing @xcite .",
    "we will consider phantom energy as an imperfect fluid , implying that the pe could contain non - zero bulk and shear viscosities @xcite .",
    "the bulk viscosities are negligible for non - relativistic and ultra - relativistic fluids but are important for the intermediate cases . in viscous cosmology ,",
    "shear viscosities arise in relation to space anisotropy while the bulk viscosity accounts for the space isotropy @xcite .",
    "generally , shear viscosities are ignored ( as the cmb does not indicate significant anisotropies ) and only bulk viscosities are taken into account for the fluids in the cosmological context .",
    "moreover , bulk viscosity related to a grand unified theory phase transition may lead to an explanation of the accelerated cosmic expansion @xcite .",
    "babichev et al @xcite studied the effects of the accretion of phantom energy onto a schwarzschild black hole taking pe to be a perfect fluid . as a first approximation",
    ", the bulk viscosity can be ignored , but to get a better picture we need to incorporate it into the phantom fluid .",
    "we have adopted the procedure of @xcite for our calculations .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in the next section we review viscous cosmology ; in section three we discuss the relativistic model of accretion onto a black hole ; in the subsequent section we use results from viscous cosmology for the accretion model ; next we give two examples to illustrate the accretion process with a constant and power law viscosity . in section six",
    "we study black hole evolution in the presence of matter and viscous phantom energy .",
    "finally we conclude the paper with a brief discussion of our results .",
    "we assume the background spacetime to be homogeneous , isotropic and spatially flat ( @xmath3 ) and described by the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric given by @xmath4,\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the scale factor .",
    "we also assume that the spacetime is filled with only one component fluid i.e. the viscous phantom energy of energy density @xmath6 ( however , in section six , we shall incorporate matter along with phantom energy ) .",
    "the einstein field equations for the frw - metric ( in the units @xmath7 ) are @xmath8 and @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the hubble parameter , @xmath11 is the effective pressure containing the isotropic pressure @xmath12 and the bulk viscous pressure @xmath13 , given by @xmath14 here @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the velocity four vector and @xmath18 is the bulk viscosity of the fluid @xcite .",
    "( 4 ) shows that negative pressure due to viscosity contributes in the effective pressure which cause accelerated expansion . in the frw model , the expression @xmath19 holds .",
    "also , @xmath20 is generally taken to be positive in order to avoid the violation of second law of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "the energy conservation equation is @xmath21 assume that the viscous fluid equation of state ( eos ) is @xmath22 note that if @xmath23 ( or @xmath24 ) , eq .",
    "( 6 ) represents the eos for cosmological constant",
    ". furthermore if @xmath25 , it represents phantom energy . in general , for normal matter @xmath26 .    using eqs .",
    "( 2 ) - ( 6 ) , we get the equation governing the evolution of @xmath27 for a given @xmath20 as @xmath28 on integration , eq .",
    "( 7 ) gives @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a constant of integration .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( 8) can further be solved to get the evolution of @xmath5 as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a constant of integration .",
    "thus for a given value of @xmath20 we can obtain expressions of @xmath5 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 from the system of eqs .",
    "( 5 ) - ( 9 ) .",
    "in the background of frw spacetime , we consider , as an approximation , a gravitationally isolated schwarzschild black hole ( bh ) of mass @xmath35 whose metric is specified by the line element : @xmath36 the background spacetime is assumed to contain one test fluid , namely the phantom energy with non - vanishing bulk viscous stress @xmath37 . the fluid is assumed to fall onto the bh horizon in the radial direction only which is in conformity with the spherical symmetry of the bh .",
    "thus , the velocity four vector of the phantom fluid is @xmath38 which satisfies the normalization condition @xmath39 .",
    "this phantom fluid is specified by the stress energy tensor for a viscous fluid @xcite : @xmath40 using the energy momentum conservation for @xmath41 , we get @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the radial component of the velocity four vector and @xmath44 is a constant of integration .",
    "the second constant of motion is obtained by contracting the velocity four vector of the phantom fluid with the stress energy tensor @xmath45 , which gives @xmath46=-a ,   \\label{4}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is a constant of integration .",
    "also @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the energy densities of the phantom fluid at the horizon of the bh , and at infinity respectively . from eqs .",

    "note that during the integration of ( 16 ) , we assumed @xmath63 and @xmath12 to be constants .",
    "in the coming subsections , we shall take these as time dependent entities .",
    "we now study the bh mass evolution in two special cases : ( a ) constant viscosity ; and ( b ) power law viscosity .      for constant viscosity @xmath64 ,",

    "we now consider a two component fluid , the viscous dark energy and matter .",

    "it is taken to be a perfect fluid while the pe is taken as a bulk viscous fluid . the effective pressure is represented by eq .",

    "however we can take a spacetime approximating it sufficiently earlier than the br .",
    "we can than see its asymptotic behavior .",
    "when the scale factor shoots to infinity , the three terms in eq .",
    "( 50 ) will contribute significantly in the bh mass evolution .",
    "the mass will decrease by the accretion of pe ( @xmath25 ) due to its strong negative pressure and is manifested in eq .",
    "notice that the final expression for bh mass depends only on the initial matter density @xmath115 in addition to constant bulk viscosity @xmath116 .",
    "the corresponding behavior of bh mass evolution is shown in figures 2 and 3 for different values of model parameters .",
    "thus for a shift of parameter @xmath117 by 2 , yields in the decline of mass ratio by a factor of 2 . the decline in the mass of the bh is observed with time showing that phantom energy accretion will be dominant over matter accretion .",
    "we have analyzed the accretion of bulk viscous phantom energy onto a bh .",
    "the modeling is based on the relativistic model of accretion for compact objects .",
    "the viscosity effects in cosmology are used to give an alternative to cosmic accelerated expansion other then dark energy and quintessence .",
    "the evolution of bhs in such a universe accreting viscous phantom energy would result in a gradual decrease in mass .",
    "this gradual decline would be faster than the non - viscous case @xcite due to additional terms containing viscosities coupled with mass .",
    "lastly , it is shown that bhs accreting both matter and viscous pe will also meet with the same fate as the viscous forces dominate over the matter component for sufficiently large scale factor @xmath5 .    from this analysis",
    ", we can draw the conclusion that pe containing viscous stresses can play a significant role in the bh mass evolution if the viscosity is sufficiently high for an appropriate eos . though the viscous stresses are negligibly small @xmath118 at the local scale of space and time they can play a significant role in time scales of @xmath119 gyrs . the higher the viscosity of the phantom fluid , the sharper the decrease in the bh mass .",
    "bhs of all masses , ranging from the solar mass to the intermediate mass to the supermassive , will all meet the same fate .    as an extension to this problem ,",
    "it is interesting to study the accretion of the phantom fluid onto primordial bhs that had formed due to initial density fluctuations in the primordial plasma .",
    "the mini - primordial bhs evaporating now via hawking radiation would have a different initial mass and hence abundance than the standard scenario expects .",
    "this work is reported in a separate paper @xcite .",
    "notice that we have used the friedmann model which is represented by an asymptotically curved spacetime and at the same time the schwarzschild black hole , which is asymptotically flat . this may seem contradictory .",
    "schwarzschild black hole has been dealt with in the context of closed friedmann cosmology @xcite .",
    "any global problem in approximating the full situation by a schwarzschild black hole inserted into friedmann model arise near the big bang or the big crunch , defined in terms of the york time @xcite as shown elsewhere @xcite , the effect will be at extremely late times in terms of the usual time parameter .",
    "more complete analysis of the asymptotic behavior near a singularity is also available @xcite , as such if we stay near to a singularity in spacetime , the approximation will be extremely good .",
    "consequently our analysis will be satisfactory for black holes formed well after the big bang greater then @xmath120s and of the big rip ( presumably much more before @xmath120s the rip ) .",
    "it is clear that we are unable to say whether there would / would not be a big rip as our analysis excludes it .",
    "mj would like to thank m. akbar for useful discussions during the work .",
    "aq is grateful to as - ictp , trieste , italy for travel support and to infn and the department of physics of salento university at lecce , for local hospitality .",
