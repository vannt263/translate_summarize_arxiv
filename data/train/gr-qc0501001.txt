    "( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "different mathematical technique @xcite also demonstrates that the point of the closest approach of photon to the moving body plays no physical role because the time of the closest approach , @xmath108 , drops out of the final equation for the light bending and/or relativistic time delay . what matters is the retarded time @xmath101 of the lienard - wiechert solution of einstein s equations , where @xmath3 is the speed of propagation of gravity from the moving body to the point of observation .",

    "1 of the present paper clearly demonstrates the origin of the observed retarded position of jupiter as caused by the lorentz - invariant nature of the gravitational field and its finite speed of propagation . a null direction connecting observer and jupiter in the relativistic time delay eq .",
    "( [ tde ] ) is that corresponding to the null characteristic of the gravitational field .",
    "this is because of two facts : ( 1 ) it originates from the retarded lienard - wiechert solution of the gravity field equations , and ( 2 ) there is no radio or light wave emitted or reflected by and propagating from jupiter towards observer during the time of the experiment .",
    "thus , the measurement of the direction of the null characteristic of the gravitational field through the retarded coordinate of jupiter , @xmath42 , through the relativistic time delay is a direct confirmation of einstein s prediction that gravitational field has the same speed of propagation as the speed of light .",
    "the reader should not interpret the retarded position of jupiter shown in figure 2 of samuel s paper @xcite as caused by propagation of sunlight reflected from jupiter as samuel @xcite erroneously used to believe .",
    "unfortunately , this was either overlooked or ignored by referees of papers @xcite despite of our persistent attempts to draw their attention to this , inconsistent with observations , fact .",
    "as explained in @xcite the radio emission of jupiter or the sunlight reflected by jupiter can not be , and was not , observed at any vlbi station due to the specific technical limitations of vlbi .",
    "anyone who discusses the nature of the jupiter - quasar experiment must learn how vlbi operates and detect radio signals before making any statements about the nature of the measured effect of the retardation of gravity .",
    "the retarded position of jupiter , measured in the experiment through the best fit of the observed vlbi time delay to its theoretical value , is due to the finite speed of gravity and reflects the fundamental fact that the gravitational field is lorentz - invariant and its null characteristics coincide with the null characteristics of the electromagnetic field withing 20% @xcite .",
    "einstein s theory of general relativity does not require introduction of any parameter for the speed of gravity @xmath28 because it is lorentz invariant and the speed of gravity is equal to the speed of light .",
    "all general - relativistic effects associated with the speed of gravity can be easily and unambiguously identified through the retarded positions of the gravitating bodies in the post - minkowskian solutions of the gravity field equations and equations of motion .",
    "will @xcite has decided to introduce the parameter @xmath28 for the speed of gravity to facilitate discussion of the relativistic effects associated with the speed of gravity from those caused by the `` speed of light '' @xmath3 .",
    "introduction of @xmath28 to the einstein equations is not trivial and requires to retain all differential relationships of general relativity for any value of @xmath28 .",
    "this task was not fulfilled in @xcite .",
    "we have found @xcite the @xmath28-parametrization of einstein s equations which preserves all differential and algebraic properties of those equations for any value of the parameter @xmath28 .",
    "this @xmath28-parametrization requires introduction of a global unit vector field , @xmath109 , which goal is to keep the lorentz invariance of the gravity field equations .",
    "the difference between @xmath28 and @xmath3 leads to one kind of observable effects while existence of spatial components , @xmath110 , of the vector field @xmath109 leads to apperance of the preferred frame effects ( the ppn parameters @xmath111 , @xmath112 ) which have been strongly limited by pulsar timing and lunar laser ranging observations @xcite .",
    "hence , in the paper @xcite we did not analyzed the preferred frame effects caused by @xmath110 and worked in the coordinate system , where @xmath113 , to concentrate on the discussion of the retardation of gravity effect @xcite .",
    "therefore , spatial vector field @xmath110 does not appear explicitly in our derivation of the relativistic time delay equation",
    ". however , correct transformation of our time delay equation , derived in @xcite for the case of @xmath114 , from one frame to another requires accounting for the preferred frame vector filed @xmath110 , which was not done by samuel in deriving his equation ( 7.2 ) in @xcite .",
    "thus , samuel s criticism of my paper @xcite is completely unfounded and is based on his misunderstanding of the mathemtical formalism which has been worked out in @xcite .",
