    "bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) in the optical lattices have become an universal laboratory to study various quantum phenomena of the condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "a spectacular achievement in this direction is the demonstrated single - site addressability of the two - dimensional optical lattices @xcite , i.e. the atoms can be controllably removed from the lattice sites selected at will .",
    "another intriguing recent development is observation of the unconventional boson superfluidity in the higher bands of the optical lattice @xcite , described by a complex - valued order parameter and , therefore , beyond the no - node theorem of r. feynman ( see for instance , the review @xcite ) .    the purpose of the present paper is to demonstrate that the single - site addressability in the optical lattices allows one to generate the unconventional boson superfluids . to this goal",
    ", one can use the controlled removal of atoms by the technique of refs .",
    "@xcite from a periodic sublattice of the optical lattice with bec loaded in it .",
    "it is shown below that the condensate is driven to a coherent non - local bloch - like state described by a complex - valued order parameter ( in the two - dimensional case ) or the order parameter with nodes ( in the one - dimensional case ) .",
    "this is achieved by the emulation of a coherent non - local dissipation by a local one , similar as in the recently proposed scheme for generators of the non - classical states of photons @xcite .",
    "the quantum state engineering based on the dynamics in the open quantum systems @xcite , in particular in the optical lattices @xcite , is a well - known idea . as distinct from the previous proposal of the quantum state engineering in the optical lattices",
    "( see also the recent study @xcite ) , where the inter - site atomic currents are coupled to reservoirs , in our case the dissipation acts _ locally and incoherently _ on a periodic sublattice of the lattice sites , whereas the condensate is driven to a non - local coherent state .",
    "it is known that the action of dissipation in conjunction with the nonlinearity can increase coherence of the quantum state of bec .",
    "for instance , the possibility to engineer the order parameter of bec by a localized dissipative perturbation ( i.e. by a dissipative defect ) was shown in ref .",
    "it was also shown that the quantum coherence of a strongly interacting bec loaded in the double - well trap subject to the phase noise and particle loss can be completely restored by engineering the parameters of the system and controlling the dissipation rate @xcite .",
    "similar results were obtained with the optical lattices , where the particle loss at the boundary acting together with the nonlinearity resulted in restoration of the coherence and formation of the discrete breathers @xcite . whereas in the previous setups",
    "the action of a _ localized or boundary _ dissipation was considered , in the present proposal we consider the action of a",
    "_ periodic dissipation _ which profoundly affects the physics in the optical lattice .",
    "therefore , to distinguish such a setup from the usual optical lattice , it will be called below the dissipative lattice .",
    "indeed , a strong periodic dissipation effectively changes the lattice space group , it results in a bigger unit cell for the dissipative lattice as compared to the same lattice without the periodic dissipation .",
    "the dissipative lattice can have both the dissipative as well as the ( almost ) non - dissipative coherent modes , which are fourier - like expansions over some superpositions of the local modes in each unit cell .",
    "the long - term state of bec in the dissipative lattice is a lowest energy subset of the effective dark states , i.e. the states almost unaffected by the dissipation as the result of the quantum zeno effect @xcite ( see also the reviews @xcite ) . finally , in contrast to the previous works , a weak nonlinearity in our case plays only an auxiliary role ( see the honeycomb lattice example below ) , which is to break the energy degeneracy of the effective dark states and select one particular state .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we consider the simple case of the one - dimensional periodic dissipative lattice , where the action of a periodically distributed dissipative sites is discussed .",
    "then , in section [ sec3 ] , we consider a more involved case of a dissipative honeycomb optical lattice .",
    "section [ sec4 ] contains the discussion of the main results and a general perspective on the dissipative periodic lattices .",
    "here we consider the simplest case of one - dimensional dissipative lattice to illustrate the main idea .",
    "specifically , we concentrate on the one - dimensional lattice where each third lattice site is dissipative with the same dissipative rate , see fig .",
    "the selected periodicity of the dissipative sites is the most dense one within the class of the dissipative sublattices which still allow for the non - dissipative coherent modes in the unit cell ( see fig .",
    "[ fg1](a ) ) .",
    "we consider the tight - binding approximation with the nearest neighbor tunneling and a weak nonlinearity as compared to the tunneling and dissipation rates",
    ". then the standard boson hubbard hamiltonian applies , which in the notations of fig .",
    "[ fg1](a ) reads @xmath0 where the index @xmath1 enumerates the unit cells of the dissipative lattice .",
    "note that the dissipative lattice period is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the period of the original ( non - dissipative ) lattice .",
    "we assume that the atoms are removed with a constant and uniform rate @xmath4 from the sublattice of sites as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fg1 ] , which can be realized , for example , by the technique of refs .  @xcite .",
    "then , the state of the system is given by the density matrix @xmath5 satisfying the quantum master equation in the lindblad form ( see , for more details , ref .",

    "the reason to use a larger unit cell of the lattice in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) is that , for a strong dissipation rate , the population of the dissipative sites is locked to that of the non - dissipative ones ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for further details ) and can be adiabatically eliminated . in this way",
    ", the problem of finding the ground state of bec in the dissipative lattice is reduced to that of a modified non - dissipative lattice , where the boson operators in each unit cell are some coherent modes over the non - dissipative sites ( @xmath7 below ) .",

    "we focus on the limit of strong dissipation @xmath8 and neglect the nonlinearity assuming it to be too weak to have contribution on the considered time scale .",
    "specifically , we assume the condition @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the average atomic filling of the non - dissipative wells . by performing the adiabatic elimination of the dissipative sites ( @xmath11 ) ( for the details , consult ref .",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) suggests to define the coherent modes in each unit cell as follows @xmath15 , then the tunneling part of the reduced hamiltonian becomes @xmath16 since only mode @xmath17 is coupled directly ( with the coupling coefficient @xmath18 ) to the dissipative mode @xmath11 in each unit cell , the reduced master equation reads ( ref .",

    "leaves the lindblad term in the master equation ( [ eq4 ] ) invariant , i.e. eq . ( [ eq4 ] ) has the same form in the bloch basis = -[h_r,_r ] + _ n_r .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) defines a subspace of the dark states , which consists of the bloch modes decoupled from the dissipative modes @xmath23 .",
    "to find such modes we rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ eq3 ] ) in the bloch basis @xmath24 it is seen that the dark subspace contains two bloch modes @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( more precisely , the bloch modes with @xmath27 , for @xmath28 or @xmath29 , have significantly reduced decay rate due to weak coupling to the dissipative modes , since the coupling coefficient reads @xmath30 ) .",
    "moreover , since the dissipative lattice modes @xmath31 have a negative kinetic energy , see eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) , the lowest energy mode is the bloch mode @xmath26 .",
    "note that the long - term ground state @xmath26 breaks the discrete translational symmetry of the dissipative lattice ( the translation by @xmath32 ) , since in terms of the local basis we have _ , - = _ n ( -1)^n(a_n,+- a_n,- ) , which is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fg1](b ) .",
    "let us summarize the main conclusions of this simple example .",
    "the dissipative optical lattice with a strong dissipation rate is effectively equivalent to an effective non - dissipative lattice , which has unusual properties of the long - term ground state of bec . in this particular case the effectively negative kinetic energy of the non - dissipative sublattice results in the bloch state with a non - zero quasimomentum , which breaks the translational symmetry of the dissipative lattice .",
    "below we consider a more intriguing example of two - dimensional lattice , where the sublattice of the dissipative sites induces a long - term state of bec with a vortex - like phase distribution .",
    "let us now consider the lattice with the hexagonal symmetry , namely , the honeycomb optical lattice .",
    "the specific choice of the lattice has two reasons .",
    "first , in the tight - binding limit , the honeycomb lattice reduces to just four nearest - neighbor sites with equal tunneling amplitude , where three sites are arranged in the form of an equilateral triangle and one more cite is placed at its center , see fig .",
    "[ fg2](a ) . from this perspective , by application of the external dissipation to the central cite in each such triangle one arranges for the three non - dissipated sites coupled to it , thus the next possible number as compared to the one - dimensional case considered in section [ sec2 ] .",
    "second , within the class of two - dimensional lattices , the lattices with the hexagonal symmetry are known for their intriguing properties , such as the appearance of the dirac cones ( i.e. the dirac hamiltonian ) in the bloch band intersections and the related topological phase transitions @xcite , including the phase transition from the conventional to unconventional superfluidity @xcite .",
    "thus , one naturally expects the dissipative honeycomb lattice to possess an interesting long - term ground state .",
    "the simplest honeycomb optical lattice , which was experimentally realized @xcite , is created by intersection of three laser beams of of the same frequency and equal intensities .",
    "when the lasers are blue detuned from the atomic transition frequency , the lattice minima are at the vertices of honeycombs . in this case",
    ", the optical lattice potential reads @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , @xmath35 are the basis vectors of the reciprocal lattice , with @xmath36 being the vector @xmath37 rotated by @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "we note that , interestingly , the following lattice v = 8v_0 ^ 2 ( ) ^2()^2 ( ) , shown in fig .",
    "[ fg2](a ) , has also the honeycomb shape , but possesses much more pronounced minima of the lattice wells ( it can be realized with the recent optical lattice technology @xcite , see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the results obtained below , however , apply to any of the optical lattices reducible in the tight - binding limit to the honeycomb arrangement of the lattice wells , where in each equilateral triangle there are three non - dissipated sites located at the vertices and the dissipative site located at the center , i.e. as in fig .",
    "[ fg2 ] .    taking into account the discussion of section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we will use from the start the nomenclature defined by the dissipative lattice , see fig . [",
    "in particular , the lattice wells are enumerated as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg2 ] , where each elementary triangle ( shown by the thin lines in fig .",
    "[ fg2](a ) ) contains one dissipative lattice well at the center , to which we assign the boson annihilation operator @xmath40 , and three non - dissipative wells at the vertices , with the corresponding operators @xmath41 , as is schematically shown in fig .",

    "our division of the hexagonal lattice into the equivalent hexagons , as in fig .",
    "[ fg2](b ) , and the specific enumeration scheme are dictated by the geometry of the strongly dissipative sublattice .",
    "though the indices of the local operators assigned to the non - dissipative sites in each hexagon still can be distributed at will , the selected enumeration shown in fig .",

    "we have found that the strong dissipation effectively changes the lattice space group , which results in a larger unit cell than that of the original optical lattice without the dissipation .",
    "moreover , the base boson operators in the case of the dissipative lattice are linear superpositions of the local operators of the non - dissipative sites , what results in the ground state with a non - trivial complex - valued order parameter . for instance , in the dissipative honeycomb lattice the long - time ground state is a coherent superposition of the alternating discrete vortices and anti - vortices .",
    "we have considered just two examples , the simple one - dimensional case and the honeycomb lattice , where we have chosen some particular distributions of the dissipative sites which allow one to obtain the long - term ground state in explicit analytical form . however , similar results are expected to hold quite generally for the optical lattices with a sublattice of dissipative sites .",
    "moreover , similar behavior of bec is expected in dissipative optical lattices in the continuous limit ( as opposed to the tight - biding limit ) , which will be considered in a future publication ."
