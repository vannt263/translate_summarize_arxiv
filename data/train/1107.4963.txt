    "recent years have seen a distinctive surge in the formulation and application of stochastic models of biochemical reaction kinetics .",
    "this trend has resulted from a deeper , ongoing appreciation of the conditions characteristic of the intracellular environment @xcite and of their dissimilarity from _ in vitro _ conditions .",
    "typical _ in vivo _ concentrations are in the range of nanomolar to millimolar ; such concentrations realized in a macroscopic volume imply very large copy numbers of interacting molecules whereas the same concentrations in the small volume of a cell frequently implies copy numbers ranging from few tens to at most few thousands ( for a detailed experimental protein abundance study see , for example , ref .  ) .",
    "reaction kinetics is inherently a stochastic process;@xcite this noisiness is not apparent in macroscopic conditions due to an implicit averaging over a very large number of molecules but can not be overlooked when we are studying the kinetics of a system in which the copy number of at least one species is small .",
    "this is frequently the case of intracellular kinetics .",
    "the introduction of the stochastic simulation algorithm by gillespie @xcite has popularized the numerical study of stochastic reaction kinetics . however to - date",
    "the analytical study of the properties of such systems has received comparatively very little attention principally because the mathematical formalism of stochastic kinetics [ i.e. , chemical master equations , ( cmes ) ] is very different than that of deterministic kinetics [ i.e. , rate equations ( res ) which are based on ordinary differential equations ] and is less amenable to analysis .",
    "this problem is augmented by the fact that many biological networks of interest are considerably large .",
    "one of the main analytical methods for systematically exploring the stochastic properties of these networks has been the linear - noise approximation.@xcite the advantage of this method is the relative ease with which one can compute the magnitude of intrinsic noise ( i.e. , coefficients of variation and fano factors ) .",
    "the major drawback is that the linear - noise approximation gives only meaningful results provided the copy number of molecules is not small or to be more precise it is correct in the limit of infinitely large reaction volumes , i.e. , the same limit in which the res are valid .",
    "since intracellular reactions occur in the opposite limit of small volumes , it is highly desirable to calculate the finite - volume corrections to the concentrations and moments of intrinsic noise .",
    "developing a theory of finite - volume corrections presents a considerable analytical challenge .",
    "one way to obtain the latter is via the system - size expansion of the cme.@xcite the linear - noise approximation comes about by evaluating the first term ( of order @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the reaction volume ) in this expansion .",
    "the next term is proportional to @xmath2 and hence consideration of this term will necessarily give a finite - volume correction .",
    "grima@xcite calculated the first such corrections for the mean concentrations of species involved in single - substrate enzyme reactions and recently also for a general chemical reaction network of arbitrary complexity.@xcite the general result is that the kinetics of a reaction pathway confined in a volume @xmath1 can be described by the usual res plus new terms which are proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "these equations are referred to as effective mesoscopic rate equations ( emres ) .",
    "the differences between the solution of emres and the corresponding res for finite volumes stems from a coupling between the mean concentrations and the fluctuations about them .",
    "emres can be explicitly solved for pathways characterized by a handful of chemical species , but otherwise one has to resort to numerical solution . in the latter cases ,",
    "one obtains a solution at the expense of losing the insight which typically comes from analytical results .    in this article",
    "we develop an alternative , powerful method of calculating finite - volume corrections to the solutions of the res .",
    "note that in the context of this article , finite - volume corrections exclusively refer to corrections to the mean concentrations not to the moments of intrinsic noise .",
    "the method is based on the poisson representation of the cme rather than the system - size expansion used in the derivation of emres .",
    "this method unlike the system - size expansion has been applied to study systems of biochemical or biological relevance in only a handful of cases ( see , for example , refs .   and ) but as we shall show it is a tool with great potential for this field .",
    "we focus on chemical reaction networks which are composed of enzyme - catalyzed reactions , a commonly encountered case in intracellular biochemistry.@xcite we show that when the timescales of complex and substrate fluctuations are well - separated , it is possible to obtain explicit and impressively simple equations for the finite - volume corrections . for simple reactions these corrections",
    "are shown to be the same as given by the emre .",
    "the distinct advantage of the new method over the emre is that it provides analytically simple results even for complex networks with hundreds or thousands of species .",
    "this is inherently possible because of the large reduction in the effective dimensionality of the cme when timescales are well separated .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we derive the poisson representation for a general enzyme - reaction network and use the resulting fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) to obtain an exact liouville equation encoding all information about deviations from the deterministic solution of the res . in section iii we show that in the limit of well - separated timescales of complex and substrate species , the liouville equation simplifies to a compact approximate form .",
    "this is used in section iv to compute explicit expressions for the finite - volume corrections of a general network . in the latter section",
    "we show that the corrections for a simple michaelis - menten type reaction agree with those previously derived using the emre formalism .",
    "more importantly we apply the theoretical results to two common types of large - scale networks and confirm the predictions using simulations .",
    "we finish by a discussion in section v.",
    "in this section we use the poisson representation to derive a general fpe for an enzyme reaction network .",
    "the latter while being exactly equivalent to the cme is much more amenable to analysis and hence is a very convenient starting point for detailed calculation purposes .",
    "we consider a generic type of enzyme network composed of two major types of chemical processes : ( i ) the input of a substrate species @xmath4 into a subcellular compartment ; ( ii ) the transformation of @xmath4 into some final product @xmath5 via @xmath6 consecutive enzyme - catalyzed reactions of the type @xmath7{k_1 } c_i \\overset{k^i_2}{\\longrightarrow } { e}_i+a_{i+1},\\ ] ] where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the @xmath11 substrate , complex and enzyme species , respectively ; the index @xmath12 takes values from 0 to @xmath13 and the @xmath14 denote the relevant macroscopic rate constants .",
    "note that we have assumed here that the bimolecular reaction rate , @xmath15 , is the same for all substrates .",
    "note also that in such types of networks there are @xmath6 distinct substrate species , an equal number of distinct complex species and a number of enzyme species varying between 1 and @xmath6 .",
    "the freedom in choosing the number of enzyme species comes from the fact that an enzyme can generally bind to more than one type of substrate .",
    "if we assume that we have well - mixed conditions inside the compartment then the instantaneous description of the state of a chemical system at time @xmath16 is simply given by the vector of the absolute number of molecules of each species , @xmath17 .",
    "since the mesoscopic kinetics are stochastic , a full description of the system is necessarily probabilistic and is achieved by defining the probability density function , @xmath18 and its time - evolution equation , which is commonly referred to as the cme ( refs .   and )",
    "@xmath19 where @xmath1 is the compartment volume , @xmath20 is the contribution due to the input of substrate species @xmath4 into the system at a rate @xmath21 while @xmath22 describes the @xmath11 catalytic reaction step , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : singlestep ] ) , in the reaction network .",
    "the cme is compactly expressed using van kampen s step operators defined as @xmath23 .",
    "substantially , the cme depends only on the set of variables @xmath24 and @xmath25 since an enzyme molecule can be either in the free state or in the complexed state and hence the variables @xmath26 are redundant .",
    "we can express this conservation law by writing @xmath27 where the matrix @xmath28 is defined by construction to be @xmath29 the @xmath6-dimensional vector , @xmath30 , is associated with the enzyme binding substrate in the @xmath12-th catalytic reaction .",
    "its @xmath31-th entry is chosen to be equal to one if the enzyme can form a complex with the @xmath31-th substrate and zero otherwise .",
    "hence the connectivity of the network is explicitly encoded in the form of these vectors .",
    "we define the moment generating function , parameterized by the vector of continuous variables , @xmath32 , as @xmath33 multiplying the cme , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : master_general ] ) , by @xmath34 , performing the summation over all values of the variables @xmath35 and expressing the resulting equation in terms of the moment generating function @xmath36 , we obtain the moment generating function equation @xmath37 where @xmath38 abbreviates @xmath39-v^{-1}\\sum z_{c_i } \\partial_c^i$ ] and @xmath39=e_t^i / v$ ] is the total enzyme concentration associated with the enzyme binding substrate in the @xmath11 catalytic reaction step .",
    "furthermore we set @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 ( commonly referred to as the michaelis - menten constant ) and @xmath43 .",
    "note that in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : rg ] ) all derivatives are to the right .",
    "we proceed by making use of gardiner s poisson representation . at the heart of this method",
    "is the assumption that the probability density function @xmath44 can be expanded as a superposition of multivariate uncorrelated poissons @xcite @xmath45 where the function @xmath46 is usually referred to as the quasi - probability density function .",
    "the vector @xmath47 is defined to be @xmath48 .",
    "it has been shown that this superposition always exists if the range of @xmath47 is extended to the complex plane by analytic continuation of the poisson kernel .",
    "we have explicitly introduced @xmath1 in our superposition definition , which is not customarily done in the poisson representation . in doing so , we obtain the representation in intensive variables , i.e. in units of concentrations , as those encountered in the theory of rate equations .",
    "the above expansion is equivalent to writing the moment generating function as @xmath49 it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : mgf_eq ] ) and ( [ eqn : superpos_g ] ) ( see appendix [ app : rp ] for details ) @xmath50 where we have utilized the notation @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "note that @xmath53 is the variable for the product formed after @xmath6 catalytic steps .",
    "note also that @xmath54 is not a constant , but is given by the operator @xmath55- { \\sum}_{j } g_{ij } ( 1-\\nu^2 \\partial_{c_j})\\alpha_{c_j},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is essentially the poisson representation of the conservation of total enzyme molecules .",
    "the above equation generally differs from the corresponding deterministic conservation law in terms of concentrations ; the latter is described only by its average , while the former exhibits finite volume corrections due to the finite copy number of enzyme molecules . given eq .",
    "( [ eqn : eoperator ] ) , we see that the poisson representation , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ffpe ] ) , yields a fokker - planck equation in terms of substrate and complex variables . note also that for the case of @xmath56 we obtain the representation for the single - substrate single - enzyme reaction , which is usually referred to as the michaelis - menten reaction .",
    "this completes the derivation of the poisson representation of our general enzyme - reaction network .",
    "note that this is not the same fpe as that which arises from the system - size expansion method of van kampen.@xcite in the latter case , the fpe is an approximation to the cme in the limit of large volumes whereas the fpe obtained from the poisson representation is exactly equivalent to the cme .",
    "a further boon of the poisson representation is that once we have calculated the moments of the continuous variables , @xmath57 , using the fpe , we can very easily find the corresponding moments of the copy number of molecules , @xmath58 , using the following simple relationships:@xcite @xmath59 where the angled brackets imply the statistical average : on the left hand side of the above equations these are given by @xmath60 while those on the right hand side imply @xmath61 = @xmath62 .",
    "the kinetics becomes deterministic in the macroscopic limit of infinitely large volumes .",
    "this can be easily verified by noting that all second - order derivatives in the fpe are multiplied by a factor proportional to the inverse of the volume . to compute the finite - volume corrections",
    "we will need to separate the mesoscopic and macroscopic evolution equations .",
    "we now show that this can be done by applying a suitable change of variables to the poisson representation .",
    "the macroscopic corresponds to a shot noise contribution , which agrees on average with the mean - field result i.e. with the solution of the res for the substrate - enzyme network .",
    "the mesoscopic contribution reflects the non - equilibrium properties of the network due to the bimolecular character of the substrate - enzyme interaction , and depends parametrically on the mean - field expectation .",
    "we express the deviation from the deterministic path by the following change of variables : @xmath63(t ) + \\nu \\epsilon_{a_i } , [ c_i](t ) + \\nu \\epsilon_{c_i})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we shall refer to @xmath64 as the mesoscopic correction to the deterministic , macroscopic concentration @xmath65(t)$ ] of species @xmath66 . note that the above equation has the same apparent form as the van kampen ( vk ) ansatz,@xcite at the heart of the system - size expansion , but the context of the application is completely different .",
    "the vk ansatz is applied to the integer number of particles in the cme leading to an infinite series in powers of the inverse square root of the volume , which has to be truncated ; the first term of this expansion ( the one proportional to @xmath0 ) gives a linear fpe which is an approximation to the cme . in our case",
    "the change of variables , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ansatz ] ) , is applied on the fpe arising from the poisson representation which leads to a finite series and allows for exact analytical treatment ; as we shall show now , this divides the exact fpe into a macroscopic term and a term which captures _ all _ deviations from the macroscopic .",

    "it also then follows that the mesoscopic equation is simply given by @xmath80 where we have renormalized time to @xmath81 .",

    ", this is the first time that the `` mesoscopic qssa '' has been used to obtain a simple analytical picture of the stochastic dynamics of large networks in finite volumes , i.e. , considering effects beyond the conventional fluctuation - dissipation theorem or equivalently beyond those which can be predicted using the linear - noise approximation .",
    "previous studies employing the mesoscopic qssa have been principally occupied with the need to increase the speed of stochastic simulation.@xcite    in particular , using our approach , we have conclusively shown that the predictions of the rate equation models for the substrate concentrations will always underestimate the real substrate concentrations of a network confined in a finite volume .",

    "the topology of the network plays a determining role in the magnitude of these corrections and how they vary according to the `` position '' of the substrate species in the network .",
    "for example for the multi - substrate , single - enzyme network we find that the mesoscopic concentrations of all substrate species are larger than the re predictions by the same factor ( a global effect ) whereas in the multi - substrate , multi - enzyme network the factor is species specific ( a local effect ) .",
    "we note that in this study we have not considered the effects of diffusion and of finite particle size on the stochastic kinetics ; for the case of a simple single - substrate , single - enzyme reaction , these factors have been shown to induce a renormalization of rate constants which is apparent even at deterministic length scales.@xcite this suggests that the finite - volume corrections that we estimated in this paper constitute only a lower - bound on the actual differences between the real mesoscopic description ( which takes into account intrinsic noise and noise stemming from both factors ) and the conventional re description ( which ignores both factors and also intrinsic noise ) .    concluding , we have presented a complete method of calculation by which one can study the properties of large scale stochastic enzyme kinetic networks .",

    "<S> this is achieved by applying a mesoscopic version of the quasi - steady state assumption to the exact fokker - planck equation associated with the poisson representation of the chemical master equation . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure yields impressively simple and compact expressions for the finite - volume corrections . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that the predictions of the rate equations will always underestimate the actual steady - state substrate concentrations for an enzyme - reaction network confined in a small volume . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we show that the finite - volume corrections increase with decreasing sub - cellular volume , decreasing michaelis - menten constants and increasing enzyme saturation . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the corrections depends sensitively on the topology of the network . </S>",
    "<S> the predictions of the theory are shown to be in excellent agreement with stochastic simulations for two types of networks typically associated with protein methylation and metabolism . </S>"
