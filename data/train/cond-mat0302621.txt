    "in the following we discuss shot noise in the lowest- ( first- ) order perturbation theory in @xmath32 . we consider transport through a single level and allow for a finite spin splitting .",
    "such a spin splitting could be realized due to the zeeman effect of an external magnetic field ( for semiconductor quantum dots ) or an intrinsic exchange field due to atoms with magnetic moments ( for molecules ) .",
    "the molecule can acquire four possible states : the level being unoccupied , occupied with either spin @xmath125 or @xmath38 , or doubly occupied .",
    "the molecular level is characterized by level energies @xmath137 and @xmath138 , the coulomb repulsion @xmath16 , and the coupling strengths @xmath2 and @xmath3 to the electrodes .",
    "in addition , the electron distributions in the metal electrodes are governed by electrochemical potentials @xmath139 and @xmath140 and temperature @xmath141 .",
    "we choose a symmetric bias voltage , such that @xmath142 and @xmath143 . in this simple model without real spatial extent , the voltage is dropped entirely at the electrode - molecule tunnel junctions , meaning that the energies of the molecular states are independent of the applied voltage even if the couplings are not symmetric . for asymmetric coupling this might not be entirely realistic .",
    "however , we do not wish to include a heuristic parameter to describe the possibly unequal drop of the bias . in a comparison to an actual experiment",
    "this could be easily amended .",
    "we also do not include an explicit gate voltage , as its effects are straightforward to anticipate .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : i - s ] we plot the current and the current noise for a special choice of system parameters as a function of transport voltage . for this figure",
    "we consider a set of energy parameters ( @xmath130,@xmath131 , @xmath132 ) that is comparable to energies encountered in small molecules .",
    "a rescaling of energies by a factor 1/100 would be necessary to obtain energies of the order achievable in semiconductor quantum dots and by external magnetic fields .",
    "if the same scaling is applied to the couplings and the temperature , the figure would remain unchanged .",
    "this is a special feature of first - order transport .",
    "electron transport becomes possible when charge excitations on the molecule become energetically allowed .",
    "generally , at low bias , transport is exponentially suppressed , unless a degeneracy of states with different net charge is present ( this could be tailored by application of a gate voltage , which we do not consider here ) .",
    "each time when one of the four excitation energies @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , or @xmath147 enters the energy window defined by the electrochemical potentials of the electrodes , a transport channel opens .",
    "this gives rise to plateaus , separated by thermally broadened steps .",
    "due to the symmetric application of the bias , the steps occur at voltages of twice the corresponding excitation energy .",
    "the plateau heights depend on the coupling parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 only , i.e. , they are independent of @xmath16 and @xmath141 . the analytic expressions for current , noise , and fano factor of these plateaus , which are labeled by @xmath148 , are given in table  [ tab : table1 ] .    the curves in fig .",

    "[ fig : i - s ] , we show the results for @xmath150 ( dashed lines ) and @xmath151 ( dotted lines ) together with the case of symmetric coupling .",
    "the symmetry of our setup implies that all plateau heights are invariant under simultaneous exchange of @xmath2 with @xmath3 and @xmath139 with @xmath140 .",
    "however , the plateau height can change if only @xmath2 and @xmath3 are exchanged , or if only the bias voltage is reversed , as shown in our example for the two plateaus labeled by @xmath87 and @xmath152 .",
    "this opens the possibility to access the asymmetry @xmath8 experimentally by reversing the bias voltage and comparing the plateau heights .",

    "the classification of the configurations and the algorithm to find the corresponding analytic expressions in table  [ tab : table1 ] is given in table  [ tab : table - plateaus ] .",
    "without loss of generality we restrict ourselves to @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "the different configurations are classified by specifying which excitation energies lie within the energy window defined by the chemical potentials @xmath155 .",

    "this could be used in experiments to determine these parameters in a consistent way . in an experiment observing more than one plateau",
    ", the overcompleteness would give narrow constraints ( due to experimental uncertainty ) on whether a single interacting level can explain the measured values .",
    "of course , it is always possible to fit @xmath183 plateaus with @xmath183 noninteracting levels and different couplings per level , so an absolute decision on the presence of interactions is not possible without the additional application of a gate voltage .",
    "however , if a fit with an interacting level is feasible , the principle of parsimony should favor the model with fewer parameters .      in the absence of a spin splitting , @xmath185 ,",
    "the number of plateaus is reduced .",
    "an example for the fano factor as a function of bias voltage is displayed in fig .",

    "<S> we consider electrical transport through single molecules coupled to metal electrodes via tunneling barriers . approximating the molecule by the anderson impurity model as the simplest model which includes coulomb charging effects </S>",
    "<S> , we extend the `` orthodox '' theory to expand current and shot noise systematically order by order in the tunnel couplings . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that a combined measurement of current and shot noise reveals detailed information of the system even in the weak - coupling limit , such as the ratio of the tunnel - coupling strengths of the molecule to the left and right electrode , and the presence of the coulomb charging energy . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis holds for single - level quantum dots as well . </S>"
