    "binary and multiple stars have long provided a highly effective method of testing stellar evolution theory . as coeval systems , the intrinsic properties deduced for individual components ( luminosity , effective temperature , color ) should be consistent with models drawn from the same isochrone .",
    "alternatively , parameters that are observationally well determined for one component ( such as distance or metallicity ) can be associated with the other component(s ) .",
    "this is particularly useful in characterizing the intrinsic properties of faint companions , including both low - mass stars ( e.g. gould & chanam 2004 ) and brown dwarfs ( e.g. kirkpatrick et al .",
    "2001)of f , g , and early - k main sequence stars or subdwarfs .",
    "there is a long astronomical tradition of inverting the latter technique , and searching the environs of nearby stars for low luminosity companions .",
    "effectively , the main - sequence stars act as cosmic lamp posts , each illuminating a small corner of the solar neighborhood .",
    "the efficiency of this search process is well illustrated by its success in identifying the archetypical ultracool m dwarf , vb10 @xcite , the first l dwarf , gd165b @xcite , and the first t dwarf , gl229b @xcite .",
    "subsequent studies have built on this foundation , using a variety of methods , including coronagraphy ( e.g. oppenheimer et al . 2001 ) , wide - field ground - based imaging ( e.g. simons et al .",
    "1996 ) , and high - resolution imaging with both the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ; e.g. golimowski et al .",
    "2004 ) and ground - based adaptive optics ( ao ) systems ( e.g. close et al . 2003 ; siegler et al . 2005 ; burgasser et al .",
    "2006 and references within ) .",
    "this paper describes our use of ao techniques on the gemini telescope to search for low - mass brown dwarf and planetary mass companions around young , early - m dwarfs in the vicinity of the sun .",
    "section [ sampsel ] describes the sample selection and section [ obs ] describes our observations .",
    "sections [ red ] and [ ana ] outline reduction and derived system parameters and section [ dis ] discusses their implications .",
    "the primary goal of our observing program is to identify very low - mass brown dwarfs as companions to nearby stars .",
    "that goal constrains our choice of targets .",
    "the probability of detecting a companion depends on the contrast with respect to the underlying flux distribution of the primary .",
    "the contrast , in turn , depends on the relative luminosity of primary and secondary , the angular separation , and the point - spread function ( psf ) .    lacking a long - lived central energy source , brown dwarfs cool and fade over relatively rapid timescales ; moreover , low - mass brown dwarfs cool faster than high - mass brown dwarfs ( @xmath9 ; burrows et al . 2001 ) .",
    "thus , all other factors being equal , targeting young stars maximizes the probability of detecting low - mass brown dwarf companions .",
    "the nearest young star forming regions , however , lie at distances of more than @xmath10 parsecs , while even the 10 to 20 myr - old members of field associations , such as tw hya and tucana , are at distances of 50 to 100 parsecs from the sun @xcite .",
    "thus , the advantages offered by youth need to be balanced against the concomitant disadvantages of loss of linear resolution and flux .",
    "optimizing the contrast between primary and secondary presents a similar dilemma . in principle , very low - luminosity primaries offer the best prospects of detecting even lower luminosity secondaries ; hence , ( young ) ultracool dwarfs ( spectral types later than m7 ) might appear to be the best targets for our program .",
    "however , recent surveys have shown that the binary frequency decreases towards later spectral types , primarily because the maximum separation is a strong function of the total system mass .",
    "few ultracool binaries are found in the field with separations exceeding 10 au ( reid et al .",
    "2001 ; close et al . 2003 ; burgasser et al .",
    "2003 , 2006 ; bouy et al . 2003 ; gizis et al . 2003 ; martn et al . 2003 ; siegler et al .",
    "2005 ) , and it is helpful for any survey for very low - mass companions to focus on systems within the immediate solar neighborhood .",
    "the space density of ultracool dwarfs is relatively low , with only @xmath11 l dwarfs within 20 parsecs of the sun @xcite .",
    "most of those systems are likely to be older than @xmath12myr @xcite .    given these competing factors , we have chosen to target early - m dwarfs in the present survey . while these systems are more luminous than l dwarfs ( @xmath13 as compared with @xmath14 )",
    ", they are much more numerous ( @xmath15 systems within 20 parsecs ) and support binary systems with separations as wide as 400au . moreover",
    ", the relative level of coronal activity provides a mechanism for selecting the youngest systems for observation in our program .",
    "m dwarfs have active chromospheres and coronae , characterized by optical emission ( ca ii h&k and balmer lines ) and x - ray emission , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows x - ray activity ( plotting @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the flux measured by rosat ) as a function of spectral type and @xmath18 color for stars from the tw hydrae association ( @xmath19 myr ; reid 2003 ) , the pleiades ( @xmath20 myr ; micela et al .",
    "1999 ) , the hyades ( @xmath21 myr ; reid et al . 1995b ) and local field stars @xcite .",
    "there is a clear decrease in activity with age , with most of the field stars lying well below the cluster members .    ]",
    "using the data plotted in figure [ fig1 ] as a guide , we have defined selection criteria in the [ @xmath22 , @xmath18 ] plane that are designed to identify m dwarfs with activity levels comparable to or exceeding those of pleiades members : @xmath24 given the dispersion in activity levels at a given age , most single stars in this sample are likely to have ages younger than @xmath25 myr .",
    "we have applied these criteria to two data sets : @xmath26 proper motion stars from the 2mass - based nstars survey described by @xcite ; and @xmath27 previously - uncataloged late - type field dwarfs that show significant motion between the possi and 2mass surveys ( the moving m sample , reid , cruz & allen , in prep . ) .",
    "most of the former stars are drawn from the nltt proper motion catalogue @xcite , but the sample also includes lower motion dwarfs from the third catalogue of nearby stars ( cns3 ; gliese & jahreiss 1991 ) .",
    "the effective proper motion limits of both samples correspond to @xmath28 arcsec / yr , or a tangential velocity of 19 km / sec at 20pc .",
    "it is important to note that this threshold does not bias against young stars .",
    "systems like the pleiades with a relative velocity of @xmath29 with respect to the sun @xcite or tw hydrae with a relative motion of @xmath30 with respect to the sun @xcite offer exemplary proof that young stellar objects do not need to have velocities within a few km / sec of the local standard of rest .",
    "distance estimates are based primarily on photometric or spectroscopic parallaxes .",
    "both samples are drawn from the area covered by the 2mass second incremental release ( @xmath31 of the sky ) , and both were cross - referenced against the _ rosat _ bright and faint source catalogues ( voges et al .",
    "1999 ; 2000 ) , searching for counterparts within 15 arcseconds .",
    "196 stars from the first sample and 81 from the second are matched with rosat sources .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] compares the coronal activity of the stars in these two samples against our selection criteria .",
    "a total of 92 stars exceed the pleiades - like ( 100 myr ) activity threshold .",
    "however , 36 of these stars are known to be spectroscopic binaries , and it is likely that the high activity reflects rapid rotation in tidally - locked systems .",
    "we have excluded those stars from consideration in the current program , limiting observations to systems that are currently identified as single stars .",
    "nonetheless , it is probable that some of the stars targeted in this program will eventually prove to be unrecognized spectroscopic binaries , rather than pleiades - age single stars .     as a function of ( @xmath18 ) color for the @xmath32 rosat - detected sources from the nstars @xmath33 pc nltt sample @xcite .",

    "it is therefore possible that the mass ratio distribution of our early - m binaries sample has an intermediate distribution between the flat f - k distribution and the strongly peaked field vlm distribution .",
    "however , our sample of binaries is rather small .",
    "further observations of a larger number of young m stars will be needed to show if this relation holds .",
    "mass ratios @xmath462 as a function of binary separation are shown in figure [ fig12 ] .",
    "while at separations @xmath463au systems are distributed over a broad range of mass ratios , all three binaries with separations @xmath464au show mass ratios of @xmath465 .",
    "the sensitivity of the observations would have allowed for the detection of much lower mass ratios at these separations ( see figure [ fig10 ] for example ) , indicating a real lack of objects with low mass ratios and high separations .",
    "however , a sample of 14 binaries can not fill the accessible space in the @xmath466 plane uniformly , limiting the significance of this result due to low number statistics .",
    "figure [ fig13 ] shows the separation distribution of our set of 14 binaries .",
    "the physical projected separations range from 2.2 to 49.7au and possess a distribution that shows no significant peak .",
    "however , since the observations cover separations up to 15 arcseconds , which corresponds to 300au at a distance of 20pc , we conclude that the decreasing number of detected objects for separations higher than @xmath467au is a real effect .",
    "the underlying distribution therefore probably peaks within 0 to 50au .",
    "a least-@xmath468 fit of a poisson distribution to the data suggests a peak at @xmath2 .",
    "this is consistent with earlier results , for instance by @xcite , who report a broad peak at @xmath469@xmath470 for m2m4.5 binaries .",
    "bin is probably incomplete due to the finite resolution of @xmath48 corresponding to 1.6au in 20pc .",
    "[ fig13 ] ]    the separation distribution , again , shows evidence that young , early - m binaries possess transitional characteristics between earlier and later type populations . with a distribution peaking at @xmath471 @xcite ,",
    "g stars seem to have  on average  greater separations than early - m stars .",
    "field vlm binaries , however , are preferably found in significantly tighter systems .",
    "the distribution of 70 binaries with spectral types later than m5.5 shows a significant peak at @xmath472@xmath473 @xcite with a steep quantitative decrease of systems with higher separations .",
    "g  k binaries are described by a mass ratio distribution and a separation distribution that are very different from the vlm binaries characteristics ; young , early - m binaries appear to show an intermediate behavior . the higher and the lower mass distributions",
    "are apparently connected through a smooth transition embodied by early - m binaries .",
    "we have conducted a survey of 41 nearby , early - m stars of ages comparable to the pleiades cluster , searching for companions down to planetary masses using the gemini north telescope with its ao system altair . thirteen stars",
    "were observed to host fairly bright companions , 8 of these multiples ( 7 binaries , 1 triple ) are new discoveries .",
    "we derived physical parameters for each of the multiple components allowing for further analysis of the early - m star population confirming existing statistical results and contributing additional empirical constraints on star and binary formation .",
    "the binary fraction of this sample of young , early - m stars was found to be @xmath447 for mass ratios @xmath448 and @xmath449au . however , a full analysis of systematic errors and biases could not be made , this value might therefore differ significantly from the actual value for this group of stars .    the mass ratio distribution was analyzed and compared with distributions drawn from f  k stars and from vlm stars .",
    "the young , early - m binary data was shown to be best described as an intermediate distribution between the almost flat early type star distribution and the strongly @xmath474 peaked field vlm distribution , however , our sample size is relatively small .",
    "the most likely separation was found to be @xmath2 , which is less than the median value of the g binary distribution .",
    "field vlm binaries , however , tend to be bound in significantly tighter systems .",
    "we conclude that early - m binaries possess characteristics filling the gap between the very distinct field vlm population and stars earlier than m.    a sensitivity estimate to the detection of planetary mass companions was made using planetary evolution models . since we found no faint physical companions around 37 of the observed sources we can exclude  conservatively assuming an age of 500myr  companions more massive than 10m@xmath475 at separations of @xmath383 and heavier than @xmath476 at separations of @xmath382 around all these objects .",
