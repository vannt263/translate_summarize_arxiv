    "the cross - section for semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering ( sidis ) in the one - photon exchange approximation contains eight transverse - momentum dependent distribution functions @xcite .",
    "some of these can be extracted measuring the azimuthal distribution of the hadrons in the final state @xcite .",
    "three distribution functions survive upon integration over the transverse momenta : these are the quark momentum distribution @xmath6 , the helicity distribution @xmath7 , and the transversity distribution @xmath8 . the latter is defined as the difference in the number density of quarks with momentum fraction @xmath9 with their transverse spin parallel to the the transversely polarized target and their spin anti - parallel to the target .",

    "in semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering the transversity distribution @xmath12 can be measured in combination with the chiral odd collins fragmentation function @xmath13 . according to collins , the fragmentation of a transversely polarized quark into an unpolarized hadron generates an azimuthal modulation of the hadron distribution with respect to the lepton scattering plane @xcite .",
    "the hadron yield @xmath14 can be written as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the average hadron yield , @xmath17 the fraction of polarized material in the target , @xmath18 the target polarization , @xmath19 the collins asymmetry , @xmath20 the depolarization factor , and @xmath21 the fractional energy transfer of the muon .",

    "the measured collins asymmetry @xmath19 can be factorized into a convolution of the transversity distribution @xmath12 and the collins fragmentation function @xmath26 , summed over all quark flavors @xmath27 : @xmath28 here , @xmath29 is the quark charge , @xmath30 the unpolarized fragmentation function , @xmath31 the fraction of available energy carried by the hadron and @xmath32 the hadron transverse momentum with respect to the virtual photon direction .",
