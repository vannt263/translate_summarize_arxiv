    "proton and neutron ( @xmath12 ) correlation is one of the key phenomena to understand properties of @xmath1 odd nuclei ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , a deuteron - like @xmath16 @xmath12 pair plays an important role in low - lying states of light @xmath1 odd nuclei .",
    "recently , a three - body model calculation of two nucleons with a doubly magic core nucleus has been performed to study low - lying states of @xmath1 odd nuclei , and the result indicates that deuteron - like @xmath11 and di - neutron - type @xmath9 pairs ( @xmath15-coupling @xmath12 pairs ) are predominantly formed at the surface of double magic cores such as @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "moreover , in our previous work , we have studied @xmath12 correlation in @xmath18 and found the low - lying @xmath16 and @xmath19 states dominantly have the @xmath11 and @xmath9 pairs around a @xmath20 core , respectively @xcite .",
    "it indicates that @xmath15-coupling scheme is better than @xmath21-coupling scheme to understand @xmath12 pairs in light @xmath1 odd nuclei even though the @xmath15-coupling @xmath12 pairs may change to @xmath21-coupling @xmath12 pairs in heavy - mass systems because of the spin - orbit mean potential .",
    "gamow - teller transition is one of the useful observables to verify the @xmath15-coupling @xmath12 pairs because it is sensitive to the spin - isospin configuration . for light @xmath1 odd nuclei ,",
    "the gt operator flips nucleon spins and isospins of a pair and changes the di - neutron - type @xmath10 pair to the deuteron - like @xmath12 pair .",
    "this type of gt transitions correspond to the collectivity of the proton - neutron pair and dominate the gt sum rule if the core parts are spin - isospin saturated systems and give no contribution to the gt transition .",
    "these modes are different from so - called gamow - teller giant resonances which are contributed by collectivity of the excess neutrons .",
    "recently , the super - allowed gt transitions in the low - energy region have been observed and discussed in relation to the @xmath12 correlations @xcite .",
    "the @xmath15-coupling @xmath12 pairs may play an important role to the low - energy super - allowed gt transitions .",
    "however , there are a few theoretical works to systematically investigate @xmath15-coupling @xmath12 pairs in light @xmath1 odd nuclei , though proton - neutron pairing correlations in medium and heavy mass @xmath1 odd nuclei have been discussed in @xmath21-coupling scheme with mean field approaches @xcite .",
    "the authors have a constructed new framework , isospin - projected @xmath3-constraint antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( @xmath22-amd ) , which is useful in description of a @xmath12 pair in deformed or clustered systems @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the gt transitions and @xmath12 pairs in @xmath2-shell nuclei applying @xmath22-amd to @xmath23 , @xmath18 , and @xmath24 .",
    "we discuss strong gt transitions in terms of @xmath13 pair in @xmath15-coupling scheme and propose an interpretation of the initial and final states as spin - isospin partners .",
    "a particular attention is paid on the role of non - zero intrinsic spin ( @xmath25 ) of the @xmath16 @xmath12 pair and its coupling with the orbital angular momentum of @xmath12 center of mass motion and that of core rotation .",

    "for @xmath1 odd nuclei , we apply @xmath22-amd @xcite in order to deal with the @xmath12 pair formation as well as nuclear deformation and clustering . for @xmath0 nuclei , we use @xmath3-constraint amd @xcite , which has been used for structure studies of light neutron - rich nuclei as well as @xmath29 even nuclei .",
    "we here briefly explain the formulation of @xmath22-amd .",
    "details of two methods , @xmath22-amd and @xmath3-amd are described in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the original framework of amd ,",
    "a basis wavefunction is written by a slater determinant of gaussian wave packets , @xmath30,\\ ] ] @xmath31 \\ket{\\bm{\\xi}_i}\\ket{\\tau_i}.\\ ] ] in the present work , we use @xmath32 for @xmath2-shell nuclei as used in refs .  @xcite . in @xmath22-amd , we perform parity and isospin ( @xmath33 ) projections before variation as @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are parity projection operator and isospin projection operator , respectively . for the @xmath33-projected amd wavefunction , we perform energy variation under the constraint on quadrupole deformation parameters @xmath3 and obtain the optimum solution for each set of @xmath37 and @xmath38 values . in order to obtain wavefunctions for the @xmath39th @xmath40 state ( denoted by @xmath41 )",
    ", we superpose the angular momentum eigenstates projected from the obtained wavefunctions @xmath42 , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the angular momentum projection operator . here",
    ", the parameters , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , are treated as generator coordinates in the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) , and the @xmath45-mixing is taken into account .",
    "we call this method @xmath22-amd+gcm .",
    "we use the hamiltonian @xmath46 where @xmath45 is the kinetic energy , @xmath47 is the kinetic energy of the center of mass , and @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 are the central , spin - orbit , and coulomb forces , respectively . for the central and spin - orbit forces , we use the effective nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath13 ) forces same as those used for @xmath18 in the previous work @xcite .",
    "namely , we use the volkov no .  2 force of the central force with the majorana exchange parameter @xmath51 and the g3rs force of the spin - orbit force with the strength parameters @xmath52 mev .    for the bartlett and heisenberg parameters , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , of the volkov no",
    ".  2 force , we use @xmath55 for @xmath23 , which reproduce the @xmath56-wave @xmath13 scattering lengths in the @xmath16 and @xmath19 channels . for @xmath18 and @xmath24 , we adopt a parameterization @xmath57 phenomenologically modified so as to describe energy difference between the lowest @xmath16 and @xmath19 states in each nucleus . the parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 control the ratio ( @xmath58 ) of the central force in the @xmath16 channel to that in the @xmath19 channel .",
    "the present choices , @xmath55 and @xmath57 , give the ratios @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "the decrease of @xmath58 is consistent with the naive expectation that the @xmath16 interaction is somewhat suppressed by a nuclear medium effect .",
    "we should comment that , even though relative position between @xmath19 and @xmath16 spectra is sensitive to @xmath53 and @xmath54 , we obtain almost the same energy spectra in each isospin channel and also qualitatively similar results for structure properties of @xmath18 and @xmath24 in the cases of @xmath55 and @xmath57 .",
    "calculated energy spectra of @xmath23 , @xmath18 , and @xmath24 obtained by @xmath22-amd+gcm are shown in fig .  [ figure1 ]",

    "the present calculation quantitatively or qualitatively reproduces the experimental data of these properties .",
    "@xmath61 moments and @xmath26 as well as the gt transition strengths are observables that sensitively reflect spin configurations . the calculated @xmath61 moments of the ground states , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , and that of @xmath68 agree well to the experimental data . for the @xmath64 transition in @xmath23",
    ", the remarkably large @xmath69 is well reproduced by the calculation . for @xmath18 ,",

    "we have studied the gamow - teller transitions from @xmath0 neighbors to @xmath1 odd nuclei in the @xmath2-shell region by using @xmath22-amd+gcm .",
    "we have obtained that the strong gt transitions exhausting more than 50% of the sum rule for @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 . we have also found the concentration of the gt strengths of the transitions from @xmath76 states , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "these states connected with the strong gt transitions can be interpreted as `` spin - isospin partner '' states .    for further analysis ,",
    "we have introduced two - nucleon - pair densities to visualize @xmath13 pair distributions , and found that @xmath9 @xmath10 pairs and @xmath11 @xmath12 pairs are dominantly formed in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 odd nuclei , respectively .",
    "we have studied the spin and orbital configurations of the @xmath13 pairs in @xmath15-coupling scheme and discussed the behaviors of the @xmath15-coupling @xmath13 pairs in relation to the gt transitions .",
    "the ground states of @xmath0 nuclei , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 , and their partner states , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 , have major @xmath87 components , in which both the @xmath13 pairs and the core nuclei are in @xmath87 states .",
    "the excited states , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 , and their partner states have dominantly @xmath91 components mainly contributed by the @xmath13 rotation around the core , whereas @xmath92 and its spin - isospin partners have @xmath91 components with the deformed @xmath20 core rotating in @xmath91 .",
    "based on the @xmath15-coupling @xmath13 pairs , the strong gt transitions between spin - isospin partners can be understood as spin - isospin - flip phenomena from the @xmath9 @xmath10 pairs in the @xmath0 initial states to @xmath11 @xmath12 pairs in the @xmath1 odd final states .",
    "namely , the transitions @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are spin - flip phenomena of the @xmath13 pairs with @xmath93_{l=0}$ ] , whereas @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 are those with @xmath97_{l=2}$ ] . in the latter cases ,",
    "the spectra of three final states with @xmath98 are split because of the spin - orbit interaction for the @xmath11 @xmath12 pairs in @xmath99 wave .",
    "this spin - orbit splitting plays an important role in the low - energy spectra of the @xmath100 odd nuclei . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectra of @xmath101 partnered with @xmath92 show small splitting because these states have dominant @xmath102_{l=2}$ ] component , in which the spin - orbit interaction does not affect the @xmath11 @xmath12 pairs in @xmath103 wave .    in comparison with experimental data , the magnetic moments @xmath61 and the magnetic dipole transition strengths @xmath26 are reasonably reproduced in the present calculation .",
    "moreover , relatively enhanced @xmath28 for @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 show consistent features with the present results .",
    "the present calculation also succeeds in describing the concentrations of the gt strengths from the @xmath104 excited states : @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the present framework , @xmath22-amd+gcm , is a useful tool to systematically study the @xmath12 pair correlations in @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 nuclei . with this method",
    ", we can deal with nuclear deformations of the core nuclei and @xmath13 pair formation in the same footing .",
    "this is one of the great advantages superior to three - body models with a spherical inert core .",
    "as mentioned above , the strong gt transitions can be understood in terms of the transitions @xmath14 in @xmath15-coupling scheme .",
    "it means that the gt transitions is a good probe to clarify the dynamics of the @xmath12 pairs in @xmath1 odd nuclei through the connection with the @xmath10 pairs in the neighboring nuclei .",
    "we should comment that anomalous suppression of the gt transition @xmath110 is not reproduced in the present calculation and it is still a remaining problem .    in light mass nuclei ,",
    "the @xmath15-coupling @xmath12 pairs are formed . however , for heavier nuclei , the description of @xmath12 pair correlation in @xmath15-coupling scheme is no longer valid because @xmath21-coupling @xmath12 pairs and also the @xmath12 pair condensation are expected because of the spin - orbit interactions",
    ". further investigations of @xmath1 odd nuclei in a wide mass number region from light to heavy mass nuclei are required for deeper understanding of @xmath12 pair correlations .",
