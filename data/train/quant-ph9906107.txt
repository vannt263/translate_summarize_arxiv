    "the position probability distribution @xmath0 of a one - dimensional quantum particle may be represented as a probability landscape in spacetime , where hills and valleys correspond to regions of high and low probability density respectively .",
    "it has recently been discovered that generic two - dimensional structures appear across this probability landscape for a wide variety of potentials and initial conditions @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the highly - patterned nature of these structures has led to them being called  quantum carpets \"",
    ".    for the simplest case , of a one - dimensional particle moving freely between two end walls , the carpet patterns are linear , with quantised slopes and intercepts @xcite more generally , however , the patterns are curved for particles moving under the influence of a potential @xcite .",
    "colour plots of quantum carpets , for a range of examples , may be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "analogous carpet structures also arise for light diffracted by a one - dimensional periodic grating in the paraxial approximation @xcite . in this case",
    "the time variable @xmath1 is replaced by the propagation distance @xmath2 of the diffracted beam , and @xmath3 is the intensity distribution of the beam .",
    "further , it will be seen that a generalised form of these carpet structures arises for the angular distribution @xmath4 of the two - dimensional quantum rigid rotator .",
    "approaches based on interference between energy amplitudes @xcite , wigner functions @xcite , and greens function degeneracies @xcite have been used to explain the observed carpet patterns for various cases , and in particular the observed quantisation of slopes of the linear structures for the confined one - dimensional particle is well understood . however , even in this relatively simple case a number of generic features have not yet been provided with a general explanation , including the depths and widths of channel structures , the decrease of the latter two quantities with slope , and the  chopped \" nature of ridge structures ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    it will be shown in section 2 that such features can be understood to a limited extent by generalising an approach first developed by berry @xcite , based on the destructive interference of energy amplitudes ( see also @xcite ) . this generalised _ destructive interference _ approach in particular predicts valley structures along the lines @xmath5 in spacetime for a particle confined to a one - dimensional box with end walls at @xmath6 and @xmath7 , providing that the energy amplitude differences @xmath8 of the wavefunction are sufficiently small for all @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 are integers , and @xmath12 is a natural speed defined via the particle mass @xmath13 .    the destructive interference approach can be further used to show that the average channel depth is expected to decrease as @xmath10 increases ( important in resolving the olbers - type paradox that any channels at all can be discerned , given that an infinite number of them are predicted by ( [ berry ] ) in any given spacetime region ) .",
    "moreover , as shown in the appendix , it may be generalised to predict the locations of channel and ridge structures for particles moving in _ arbitrary _ one - dimensional potentials , with results in agreement with @xcite .    however , the above approach is _ not _ able to explain a number of other observed features .",
    "first , it is completely silent on the location of structures when the condition of small energy amplitude differences is not met .",
    "second , as will be shown by example , it fails to predict _ all _ observed channel and ridge structures even when this condition _ is _ met .",
    "finally , the approach yields no information on the shapes and widths of the various structures .",
    "a new approach is thus clearly called for .",
    "such an approach is developed in section 3 , based on a representation of the probability landscape as a superposition of travelling waves with velocities which are integer multiples of @xmath14 , propagating against a constant background .",
    "the primary usefulness of this decomposition is that the _ average _ of the probability distribution along any given direction in spacetime ( eg , corresponding to a channel or ridge ) is described by at most a _",
    "one of these travelling waves .",
    "in particular , the wave corresponding to velocity @xmath15 provides specific , exact information on the average locations , shapes , depths and widths of all channel and ridge structures with slope @xmath15 .",
    "connections with the destructive interference approach are briefly discussed .",
    "the averaging of @xmath0 along particular spacetime directions , to predict locations of corresponding channel structures , was first ( independently ) suggested by berry and bodenschatz @xcite in the optical grating context , who were also motivated by limitations of the destructive interference approach . that these averages arise naturally from a travelling wave decomposition of @xmath0 , and",
    "can hence be simply superposed to recover the complete probability landscape ( and to approximate it with arbitrary accuracy by considering only waves up to a given maximum speed ) has not previously been realised .    in section 4",
    "it is shown further that each travelling wave can be written as the sum of two wigner functions plus an energy amplitude term .",
    "this form is useful for showing how localisation and symmetry properties of the initial probability distribution can enhance or suppress carpet patterns . in sec .",
    "5 predictions are verified via the examples of a uniform initial wavefunction and an approximately gaussian initial wavefunction , for which analytic expressions are obtained for the travelling waves .",
    "generalisations of the results to periodic optical gratings and to the quantum rigid rotator are given in section 6 , with conclusions presented in section 7 .",
    "berry derived the locations of channel structures of a one - dimensional particle moving freely between two end walls , for the case of a _ uniform _ initial wavefunction @xcite . here",
    "his derivation is generalised to predict the quantum carpet structure for a broad class of initial wavefunctions , and in the appendix it is shown how this approach may be further generalised to predict the curved carpet structures corresponding to _ arbitrary _ one - dimensional potentials .",
    "schrdinger s equation for a free particle of mass @xmath13 confined to the interval @xmath16 , under the usual boundary conditions that the wavefunction vanishes at the endpoints , has the general solution @xmath17   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 denotes the @xmath9-th energy amplitude , @xmath14 is the speed defined in ( [ vee ] ) , and the phases @xmath19 are given by @xmath20    the position amplitude @xmath21 , and hence the position probability distribution @xmath22 , will be small if partial cancellation can be arranged between the two summations in ( [ diff ] ) .",
    "this is possible in particular if the term corresponding to summation index @xmath9 in the first summation partially cancels with the term corresponding to summation index @xmath23 in the second summation , where @xmath10 is some fixed integer .",
    "indeed , it is not difficult to show that ( [ diff ] ) can be rearranged ( to within an overall phase factor ) as @xmath24\\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\label{gen } &   + & ( 2l)^{-1/2 } \\sum_{n=1}^{\\mid k\\mid } \\psi_n   e^{i\\phi_{\\pm } ( x , t , n ) }   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the upper ( lower ) phase subscript is chosen when @xmath10 is positive ( negative ) .",
    "thus significant cancellation between energy amplitudes can take place in the first summation , leading to a small value of @xmath0 , providing that the phase - matching condition @xmath25 is met for all @xmath9 .",
    "it is the phase condition ( [ phase ] ) which leads to ( [ berry ] ) .",
    "in particular , note that channel structures in the probability landscape correspond to spacetime trajectories @xmath26 along which the position probability density is relatively low , and hence in particular to trajectories for which the phase condition ( [ phase ] ) is satisfied at all points . substituting ( [ phi ] ) into ( [ phase ] ) , differentiating with respect to time , and comparing consecutive values of @xmath9 , yields the condition @xmath27 for the slope of such a trajectory .",
    "substituting @xmath28 in ( [ phase ] ) further yields , on comparison for consecutive values of @xmath9 , condition ( [ berry ] ) .    note that while condition ( [ berry ] ) thus follows from destructive interference between pairs of energy amplitudes in ( [ gen ] ) , two further conditions are also necessary in general for channel structures to be observed .",
    "in particular , substitution of ( [ berry ] ) in ( [ gen ] ) gives the expression @xmath29 for the position amplitude along the trajectory .",
    "thus for the trajectory to correspond to a channel one requires further that ( i ) _ the differences _",
    "@xmath30 _ are small _ , and ( ii ) @xmath31 _ itself is sufficiently small_. these requirements guarantee that the first and second summations in ( [ int ] ) yield , respectively , relatively small contributions to the total amplitude , and hence to @xmath0 .",
    "they hold for a wide group of initial wavefunctions , as discussed in section 2.3 , and hence condition ( [ berry ] ) has a wide predictive power .",
    "equation ( [ int ] ) leads to a simple estimate of channel depth .",
    "in particular , the quadratic @xmath9-dependence of the phases in ( [ int ] ) implies that they are quasi - random in time , and hence the average probabilty density along a given channel can be estimated as @xmath32 note that for slowly varying energy amplitudes this expression will typically increase as @xmath31 increases , i.e. , deep channels correspond to small values of @xmath31 .",
    "it will be seen in section 3 that this expression is close to the exact average depth of the channel .",
    "a particularly simple example is when the initial wavefunction is an equally weighted superposition of @xmath33 consecutive energy eigenstates , i.e. , @xmath34 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 otherwise , for some @xmath37 . from ( [ int ] )",
    "it follows that relatively good destructive interference takes place for @xmath38 , and from ( [ pav ] ) that the average density along a channel is approximately given by @xmath39 .",
    "thus deep channels correspond to small values of @xmath31 , as expected .",
    "note moreover from ( [ chan ] ) that destructive interference is impossible for @xmath40 , and hence only a finite number of channels can be observed in this case .",
    "a previous analytic study of this example for @xmath41 confirms these results @xcite .    _ constructive _ interference between energy amplitudes in the first summation in ( [ gen ] )",
    "corresponds to adding @xmath42 to one side of the phase - matching condition ( [ phase ] ) .",
    "it follows that constructive interference takes place along trajectories as per ( [ berry ] ) , except that the product @xmath43 is now restricted to be _",
    "odd_. thus  ridges \" are predicted along such lines in the probability landscape , in agreement with numerical observations @xcite - @xcite , @xcite .",
    "moreover , the average height of these ridges may be estimated similarly to channel depths above , yielding an expression similar to ( [ pav ] ) but with subtraction replaced by addition .",
    "thus for the above example the average ridge height is predicted to be @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "finally , note that fluctuations of channel depth along a given channel are constrained to be small , simply because they are bounded by the relatively small average probability density ( which must remain positive along the channel ) .",
    "in contrast , fluctuations of ridge height are only bounded by the relatively large average ridge height , and indeed are expected to be of the same order from the quasi - random nature of the phases appearing in the analogue of ( [ int ] ) for constructive interference ( where the minus sign in the first summation is replaced by a plus sign ) .",
    "it is these relatively large fluctuations which lead to the observed generic  chopped \" nature of ridge structures @xcite .",
    "the usefulness and limitations of the generalised destructive interference approach is investigated here via two generic examples .",
    "it will be shown in particular that channels are expected as per ( [ berry ] ) for well - localised initial wavepackets ; and conversely that destructive interference fails to account for all observed channels in the case of wavepackets with periodically spaced energy amplitudes .",
    "_ * example ( i ) momentum amplitudes and localised wavepackets : * _ the probability landscapes of wavefunctions initially well - localised in a one - dimensional box have been studied in a number of special cases @xcite .",
    "here it is shown that the destructive interference approach provides a general explanation of channel locations for _ all _ initial wavepackets which have a slowly varying momentum amplitude distribution , and for well - localised wavepackets in particular .",
    "let @xmath46 denote the momentum amplitude distribution of the initial wavepacket , i.e. , @xmath47 it follows from ( [ sol ] ) and ( [ mom ] ) , recalling that @xmath48 vanishes outside the interval @xmath16 , that the energy amplitudes @xmath18 can be expressed as @xmath49   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from ( [ chan ] ) and ( [ four ] ) it follows the destructive interference approach predicts channels of slope @xmath15 , as per ( [ berry ] ) , _ providing that the momentum amplitude distribution _",
    "@xmath46 _ varies sufficiently slowly over any range of length _",
    "@xmath50 .",
    "in particular , if the initial wavepacket @xmath51 is smooth and well - localised within the box then the momentum amplitude distribution will typically be broad , with root mean square variance @xmath52 say .",
    "thus channels of slope @xmath15 are predicted for @xmath53 noting that the heisenberg uncertainty relation implies that @xmath54 , one in particular expects to see channels of slope @xmath15 for all smooth localised wavepackets such that @xmath55 .",
    "these general predictions are well borne out by the approximately gaussian initial wavepackets studied previously @xcite , @xcite - @xcite .",
    "_ * example ( ii ) periodically spaced energy amplitudes : * _ the second example to be considered here is the case where the non - zero energy amplitudes of the wavefunction are periodically spaced , i.e. , @xmath56 for some period @xmath57 and fixed integer @xmath58 .",
    "the case @xmath59 is trivial , with channels predicted as per ( [ berry ] ) just as before .",
    "the case @xmath60 corresponds to initial wavefunctions which are either symmetric or antisymmetric about @xmath61 , as @xmath58 is odd or even respectively , as can be directly seen from the form of the wavefunction in ( [ sol ] ) .",
    "the case @xmath62 will be seen to be of special significance , providing an example where the destructive interference approach breaks down .    from ( [ per ] ) it is seen that amplitudes @xmath18 and @xmath63 can only destructively interfere in the first summation in ( [ gen ] ) when @xmath10 is a multiple of the period @xmath57 and @xmath64 . accordingly , substituting @xmath65 for @xmath10 and @xmath66 for @xmath9 in the phase - matching condition ( [ phase ] ) leads to the modification @xmath67 of ( [ berry ] ) , for trajectories which correspond to channels in the probability landscape . condition ( [ pberry ] ) is equivalent to ( [ berry ] ) for @xmath59 .",
    "more generally the predicted channel locations depend upon both @xmath57 and @xmath58 , have slopes which are multiples of @xmath68 , and intersect the @xmath69-axis at multiples of @xmath70 .",
    "for example , for @xmath60 and @xmath71 ( symmetric initial wavefunctions ) , it follows that channels correspond to the trajectories @xmath72 , such that @xmath73 is even .",
    "this prediction is equivalent to eq .",
    "( 52 ) of @xcite , obtained there for the special case of an initially uniform wavefunction .    the case @xmath62 provides an example which demonstrates an incompleteness of the destructive interference approach .",
    "in particular , consider an initial wavefunction given by the equally - weighted superposition @xmath74 .\\ ] ] this corresponds to @xmath62 and @xmath71 in ( [ per ] ) , and hence from ( [ pberry ] ) _ no _ channels starting from @xmath75 are predicted .",
    "however , the density plot of the corresponding probability landscape for this example , shown in figure 1 for @xmath76 , shows that a channel of slope @xmath77 is in fact associated with this starting point .",
    "the appearance of this unexpected channel will be explained in the following section .",
    "it has been seen that the destructive interference approach successfully predicts a number of generic properties of quantum carpets , including the locations of channel and ridge structures and their corresponding average depths and heights .",
    "it does not , however , yield information on the shapes and widths of these structures ; does not predict _ all _ observed structures ( figure 1 ) ; and is in any case limited in applicability to wavefunctions with energy amplitudes which are slowly varying over ranges of length @xmath31 .",
    "thus a new , more general approach is desirable .    to introduce such an approach , it is first convenient to rewrite the wavefunction in ( [ sol ] ) in the form @xcite @xmath78 where one extends the energy amplitude coefficients @xmath18 to negative values of @xmath9 via the definition @xmath79    from ( [ sol2 ] ) one immediately has @xmath80\\pi /l}\\ ] ] for the position probability distribution",
    ". it may be seen that each term in this summation either has no spacetime dependence ( @xmath81 ) , or is a plane wave with velocity @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "collecting the @xmath81 terms into a constant background term , and grouping terms corresponding to waves propagating at velocity @xmath15 , one obtains the decomposition @xmath84\\ ] ] of the probability landscape , where the  structure functions \" @xmath85 are given by @xmath86 here @xmath87 is defined to be zero when @xmath10 is odd .",
    "equation ( [ trav ] ) is the travelling wave decomposition referred to in the introduction .",
    "the first term , @xmath88 , is a constant background term for the probability distribution , and the structure function @xmath85 is a real travelling wave travelling at velocity @xmath15 .",
    "note that @xmath85 is defined on the entire real axis , and satisfies the relations @xmath89 where the latter of these follows using ( [ extend ] ) .    the travelling wave decomposition ( [ trav ] ) provides a physical picture for the generation of the probability landscape @xmath0 , as the superposition of waves of discrete velocities propagating in spacetime against a constant background probability .",
    "however , the primary usefulness of this decomposition arises from its relationship to the statistical properties of the probability landscape .    in particular , from ( [ struc ] ) , the time average of @xmath90 is equal to @xmath91 if @xmath92 and vanishes otherwise .",
    "it follows via ( [ trav ] ) that the average of @xmath0 along the linear trajectory @xmath93 is given by @xmath94\\ ] ] for any integer k , and by @xmath88 when @xmath10 is not an integer .",
    "thus the average distribution along any direction in spacetime involves at most _ one _ structure function .      from ( [ aver ] )",
    "it is seen that @xmath91 contains all information pertaining to the average properties of linear structures of slope @xmath15 in a quantum carpet . in particular , channel /",
    "ridge structures are associated with those trajectories @xmath95 for which @xmath96 corresponds to minima / maxima respectively of @xmath85 . moreover",
    ", the average shape of these stuctures corresponds to the shape of the associated structure function .",
    "for example , @xmath97 is plotted in figure 2 for the wavefunction ( [ fig1 ] ) ( with @xmath76 ) .",
    "the deep maximum in figure 2 in the vicinity of @xmath98 implies , via relation ( [ aver ] ) , that a well - defined channel structure of slope @xmath77 crosses the @xmath69-axis at @xmath99 .",
    "this channel is precisely the unexpected channel observed in figure 1 , which was not predicted by the destructive interference approach of section 2 .",
    "note also from figure 2 that a ridge structure immediately parallel to the left of this channel is also predicted , as indeed may also be observed in figure 1 . since the structure functions in ( [ struc ] )",
    "can be trivially evaluated as sums of geometric series for this example , the average properties of all linear structures can in fact be calculated analytically via ( [ aver ] ) if desired .    in figure 3 the travelling wave decomposition ( [ trav ] )",
    "is directly illustrated , again for the wavefunction ( [ fig1 ] ) with @xmath76 , where only terms with @xmath100 have been included in the summation .",
    "comparison with figure 1 demonstrates that all linear carpet structures with slope less than or equal to @xmath101 in magnitude are reproduced in figure 3 .",
    "note finally that one can make use of ( [ aver ] ) to define the average horizontal width of a given channel or ridge structure .",
    "in particular , suppose such a structure corresponds to a trajectory passing through the @xmath69-axis at @xmath102 .",
    "define @xmath103 and @xmath104 to be the points to the right and left respectively of @xmath102 for which the average probability distribution first becomes equal to the background probability @xmath88 .",
    "the difference @xmath105 is then a natural measure of the horizontal width of the structure . from ( [ aver ] )",
    "these points correspond to the zeroes of the structure function lying either side of @xmath106 , where @xmath96 itself corresponds to a minimum or maximum of the structure function .",
    "note for a structure of slope @xmath15 that a corresponding measure of width in the direction _ perpendicular _ to the structure is obtained by dividing the horizontal width by @xmath107 .",
    "since from ( [ aver ] ) the structure functions are real , one can rewrite ( [ struc ] ) as @xmath108 replacing @xmath109 by @xmath110 in the first term of this sum and using ( [ extend ] ) then gives an alternate formula for the average probability distribution in ( [ aver ] ) : @xmath111 .\\ ] ]    the above expression clearly indicates a link between the average probability distribution and interference of the amplitudes @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "further , this interference is seen to be _ destructive _ when @xmath114 for some integer @xmath11 with @xmath43 even , thus recovering condition ( [ berry ] ) for channel structures .",
    "the destructive interference approach is thus a special case of the travelling wave approach , where condition ( [ berry ] ) corresponds to particular minima of the structure functions ( at @xmath115 ) for the case of slowly varying energy amplitudes .",
    "finally , ( [ extend ] ) can be used to rewrite ( [ comp ] ) in terms of energy amplitudes @xmath112 with @xmath116 : @xmath117 when @xmath43 is an even integer .",
    "thus the approximation in ( [ pav ] ) is seen to be quite good for small @xmath31 , and indeed is exact for @xmath31 equal to 1 or 2 .",
    "expression ( [ struc ] ) for the structure function @xmath85 is not always convenient to use .",
    "it generally involves an infinite summation , and the contributing energy amplitudes are not always easily calculated",
    ". it would therefore be useful to have a formula for @xmath85 which is directly related to the initial wavefunction @xmath48 .    to obtain such a formula , first define the normalised wavefunction @xmath118 on the interval @xmath119 by @xmath120\\\\ \\label{phi2 } & = & l^{-1/2}/(2i ) \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty } \\psi_n e^{in\\pi",

    "thus @xmath121 is an antisymmetric extension of the initial wavefunction @xmath51 .",
    "now let @xmath122 denote the wigner function of @xmath121 @xcite : @xmath123 for @xmath124 one then has , as shown further below , the remarkable relation @xmath125 - |\\psi_{k/2}|^2/2   , \\ ] ] connecting @xmath85 with @xmath126 , where @xmath127 this expression can be trivially extended to evaluate @xmath128 for all values of @xmath2 via the first of the relations in ( [ repeat ] ) .    as will be seen below , ( [ remark ] )",
    "provides a very convenient method for evaluating structure functions , and also for analysing the dependence of quantum carpets on various properties of the initial wavefunction .",
    "expansions of the probability distribution @xmath0 in terms of wigner functions have been previously obtained @xcite . however , these expansions lead only to expressions for @xmath85 involving _ infinite _ sums of wigner functions , in contrast to ( [ remark ] ) .",

    ", for example , suppose that the initial wavefunction @xmath51 is well - localised about some point @xmath137 .",
    "the corresponding wigner function @xmath138 will then be similarly localised , and hence from ( [ aver ] ) and ( [ wigpsi ] ) one predicts ( i ) a ridge structure associated with the trajectory @xmath139 ; and ( ii ) a ridge / channel structure associated with the trajectory @xmath140 for even / odd values of @xmath10 .",
    "an example verifying this prediction is given in section 5.2 below .",
    "it is also of interest to consider the cases of trajectories of the form @xmath141 ( arising from the destructive interference approach in section 2 ) . from ( [ repeat ] ) ,",
    "( [ wigpsi ] ) and ( [ int2 ] ) one has @xmath142 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath143 is the initial position probability distribution .",
    "the average probability density along these trajectories thus only depends on the phase structure of @xmath51 via @xmath87 ( which is zero for odd values of @xmath10 and typically small in general ) .    if initial distribution @xmath143 is well - localised within a region @xmath144 such that @xmath145 then from ( [ corn ] ) the average probability density along @xmath146 is essentially determined by the properties of the cosine function @xmath147 .",
    "for example , if @xmath102 satisfies @xmath148 for some integer @xmath149 , then from ( [ aver ] ) and ( [ corn ] ) one has @xmath150 corresponding to channel and ridge structures as @xmath151 is odd and even respectively ( the @xmath87 term has been ignored in ( [ local ] ) , as from ( [ psin ] ) it is typically negligible for localised wavefunctions ) . similarly , if @xmath149 is replaced by @xmath152 in ( [ max ] ) then the @xmath153 term in ( [ local ] ) vanishes , and any linear structure associated with the trajectory is suppressed .",
    "finally , rather than supposing the initial distribution to be well - localised , consider instead the case where @xmath143 has an approximate reflection symmetry about some point @xmath154 , i.e. , @xmath155 noting that @xmath143 vanishes outside @xmath16 one then has from ( [ corn ] ) that @xmath156 -    \\nonumber\\\\ \\label{supp } & = & -2\\cos\\frac{\\pi kx^*}{l } \\int_0^{\\infty}\\!\\ !",

    "linear structures associated with the trajectories @xmath158 are therefore enhanced when @xmath159 for some integer @xmath149 , and suppressed when @xmath160 .",
    "examples of such enhancement / suppression are given in the following section .",
    "the case @xmath161 on ( 0,l ) was considered by berry @xcite , who showed that the corresponding probability landscape was a fractal and explained the observed channel structures via destructive interference ( example ( ii ) of section 2.3 above ) . for this case",
    "it follows from ( [ psin ] ) and ( [ extend ] ) that @xmath162 for odd @xmath9 , with @xmath18 vanishing for even @xmath9 .",

    "it is seen that while channels are associated with trajectories @xmath72 for even values of @xmath73 , as predicted in example ( ii ) of section 2.3 , these channels are relatively broad and shallow .",

    "since the initial probability distribution is symmetric about @xmath170 for this example , one expects from ( [ supp ] ) that channels with slopes of @xmath171 are suppressed .",
    "indeed , as is most easily seen from ( [ comp ] ) ( recalling @xmath18 vanishes for even values of @xmath9 ) , one finds @xmath172 .",

    "it is easiest to evaluate the structure functions for this case via ( [ wigpsi ] ) and ( [ int2 ] ) , where one makes the ( again extremely good ) approximation that ( [ gauss ] ) can be extended over the entire @xmath69-axis .",

    "the structure function @xmath190 is plotted in figure 5 with @xmath191 and @xmath192 , for the cases @xmath193 ( dashed line ) and @xmath194 ( solid line ) . in the latter case",

    "further , from ( [ repeat ] ) one has @xmath196 , and hence there is , conversely , a high ridge associated with the trajectory @xmath197 , flanked by a deep channel on the right and a moderate channel on the left .",
    "these predicted features following from figure 5 may be directly observed in figure 6 , where the probability landscape corresponding to initial wavefunction ( [ gauss ] ) is plotted for @xmath191 and @xmath194 .",
    "the structure functions thus accurately predict the shapes of the observed linear structures .    for the @xmath193 case ( dashed line ) in figure 5 it is seen that as well as channel and ridge structures at the endpoints , there is a ridge associated with the trajectory @xmath198 , and a channel associated with the trajectory @xmath199 .",
    "these latter structures correspond to the wigner functions @xmath200 and @xmath201 discussed in section 4.2 for localised wavefunctions , and can again be observed in a plot of the probability landscape .",
    "the corresponding structures for the @xmath194 case are observed to be much less pronounced .",
    "this is because @xmath202 is localised about @xmath203 , and is thus relatively small at @xmath204 .",
    "gaussian initial wavefunctions also provide an example of the prediction in ( [ local ] ) for well localised initial wavefunctions . in particular , from ( [ gstruc ] ) ( recalling the assumption @xmath205 , @xmath206 )",
    ", one finds that @xmath207 hence ( [ local ] ) follows whenever conditions ( [ delta ] ) and ( [ max ] ) are satisfied ( with @xmath208 and @xmath209 ) .",
    "further , channels and ridges associated with trajectories @xmath210 are seen to be suppressed if @xmath211 for some integer @xmath149 .",
    "since gaussian initial wavefunctions are not only localised about @xmath185 , but are approximately symmetric about @xmath185 , one may also obtain ( [ cosi ] ) from ( [ supp ] ) , with @xmath212 .",
    "consider now a plane wave of wavelength @xmath213 incident on a one - dimensional periodic grating , of period @xmath214 in the @xmath69 direction . in the paraxial approximation",
    "the amplitude of the diffracted light then has the general form @xmath215 where @xmath2 measures distance propagated perpendicularly to the grating , the fourier coefficients @xmath216 are determined by the initial diffracted wave @xmath217 , and @xmath218 .",
    "clearly ( [ diffract ] ) is formally similar to ( [ sol2 ] ) for a quantum particle moving freely between two endwalls , and indeed analogues of quantum carpets in the grating context have been previously observed and investigated @xcite .",
    "the significant differences between ( [ diffract ] ) and ( [ sol2 ] ) are ( i ) @xmath219 is periodic on the entire @xmath69 axis whereas @xmath220 vanishes outside the interval @xmath16 ; and ( ii ) the coefficients @xmath216 need not be antisymmetric as per ( [ extend ] ) .    many of the results of sections 3 and 4 may be directly translated into the grating context .",
    "for example , the light intensity distribution @xmath221 has the travelling wave decomposition @xmath222\\ ] ] in analogy to ( [ trav ] ) , where @xmath223 is the integrated light intensity per period of the grating and @xmath224 is given by ( [ struc ] ) with @xmath18 replaced by @xmath225 .",
    "similarly , the analogue of ( [ aver ] ) is @xmath226,\\ ] ] and thus the structure function @xmath224 determines the average locations , shapes , etc of relatively dark and bright structures of slope @xmath15 in the @xmath69-@xmath2 plane .",
    "the average intensities in ( [ aver2 ] ) are precisely the  lane contrast functions \" first defined in @xcite for predicting the locations of dark structures .",
    "while one may also write down a result analogous to ( [ remark ] ) , an _ alternative _ wigner function expression for the structure functions is more useful in the grating context . in particular , define the _ periodic _ wigner function @xmath227 this differs from ( [ wig ] ) in that @xmath228 does _ not _ vanish outside the interval @xmath119 .",
    "one may then show , similarly to the proof of ( [ remark ] ) , that @xmath229 where @xmath230 is defined to vanish for odd @xmath10 .",
    "as an example of ( [ newst ] ) , suppose that a plane wave is incident on a sinusoidal phase grating , as studied in @xcite , i.e. , @xmath231 substitution into ( [ newwig ] ) and using the standard bessel integral @xmath232 = \\pi j_k(a)\\ ] ] then yields , via ( [ aver2 ] ) and ( [ newst ] ) , @xmath233 ) - |\\hat{\\phi}_{k/2}|^2\\right ] .\\ ] ] here @xmath234 is zero for odd @xmath10 , and equal to @xmath235 for even @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the last term of ( [ examp ] ) provides a correction to equation ( 25 ) of @xcite , where the average intensity along the trajectory @xmath236 was calculated for the same example . more generally , ( [ newst ] ) provides a convenient way to calculate the structure function directly from the initial amplitude @xmath217 , and ( [ inten ] ) provides a simple decomposition of the intensity distribution as a sum of travelling waves .",
    "the above results may be immediately translated into the context of the two - dimensional quantum rigid rotator , with hamiltonian @xmath237 . in particular ,",
    "@xmath238 may be interpreted as the time - dependent phase amplitude of the rotator , where one takes @xmath239 and @xmath240 .",
    "the carpet structures for this case lie on the cylinder generated by the phase and time coordinates @xmath241 and @xmath1 .",
    "the carpet structure of a quantum particle confined between two endwalls has been greatly elucidated by the travelling wave decomposition ( [ trav ] ) of the probability density , and the details afforded by this decomposition are seen to go well beyond the ambit of the destructive interference approach . in particular , the structure functions @xmath85 in ( [ trav ] ) provide _ all _ information pertaining to the average properties of linear structures in the probability landscape .",
    "the structure functions may be evaluated either from the energy amplitudes of the wavefunction , via ( [ struc ] ) ; or from the initial wavefunction , via ( [ wigpsi ] ) .",
    "the latter formula permits the dependence of generic features of carpet patterns to be directly determined from corresponding properties of @xmath51 .",
    "similarly , for the periodic grating and quantum rigid rotator one may use ( [ newst ] ) to directly evaluate structure functions from @xmath217 .",
    "one advantage remaining to the destructive interference approach is that it may be generalised to predict the carpet structure of semiclassical wavepackets moving in arbitrary one - dimensional potentials ( see appendix ) .",
    "it is hoped that a corresponding generalisation of the travelling wave decomposition ( [ trav ] ) can be found .",
    "it will be briefly indicated here how the destructive interference approach of section 2 may be generalised to predict the _ curved _ carpet structures arising in the probability landscapes of one - dimensional particles moving in general potentials @xcite . for semi - classical wavepackets",
    "the analysis is very similar to that of subsection 2.1 , and the results agree with those of kaplan et al @xcite obtained by consideration of degeneracies of the propagator for @xmath0 .",
    "now , for high energies the @xmath9-th energy eigenstate of a particle moving in a one - dimensional potential @xmath242 with two classical turning points is well approximated as @xcite @xmath243^{1/2 } \\sin [ \\hbar^{-1}\\int_{x_n}^{x } p_n(x ) dx + \\pi /4 ] , \\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the particle mass ; @xmath244 , @xmath245 and @xmath246 are the period , momentum and leftmost turning point respectively of a corresponding classical orbit of energy @xmath247 ; and @xmath247 is implicitly defined by the bohr - sommerfeld rule @xmath248    the appearance of the sine function in ( [ wkb ] ) is analogous to that in ( [ sol ] ) , and for an initial superposition @xmath249 of such states one can easily obtain the analog of ( [ gen ] ) : @xmath250\\nonumber \\\\ \\label{arb } &   + &   \\sum_{n=1}^{\\mid k\\mid } a_n ( x ) e^{i\\phi_{\\pm } ( x , t , n ) }   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath251^{1/2 } c_n    , \\\\",
    "\\label{arbphi } \\phi_\\pm ( x , t , n ) & = & \\pm \\hbar^{-1 } \\int_{x_n}^x p_n(x ) dx -\\hbar^{-1 } e_n t   \\pm \\pi /4   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as in ( [ gen ] ) , the upper ( lower ) phase subscript is chosen in ( [ arb ] ) when @xmath10 is positive ( negative ) , and an overall phase factor has been dropped .",
    "destructive interference in the first summation in ( [ arb ] ) , giving rise to a channel structure , can take place along a spacetime trajectory @xmath252 if the phase condition ( [ phase ] ) holds for @xmath253 defined in ( [ arbphi ] ) ( providing that the amplitude functions @xmath254 in ( [ amp ] ) vary sufficiently slowly with @xmath9 ) . substituting ( [ arbphi ] ) into ( [ phase ] ) and differentiating with respect to @xmath1 yields the condition @xmath255 for the trajectory @xmath256 , where the @xmath257 sign is chosen according to whether @xmath10 is positive / negative .",
    "moreover , if the trajectory passes though point @xmath102 at time @xmath258 , one requires from ( [ phase ] ) and ( [ arbphi ] ) that @xmath259 /\\hbar = \\pi /2\\bmod 2\\pi   .\\ ] ] for the case of a potential energy which is symmetric about @xmath102 , this expression may be simplified via ( [ bohr ] ) to give @xmath260    channel structures for various potentials have been numerically observed for a number of examples @xcite , and ( [ traj ] ) has been previously derived in @xcite , via a decomposition of the probability distribution rather than of @xmath21 ( which produces an extra set of trajectories , discarded as  classical \" ) .",
    "here it is seen that ( [ traj ] ) arises directly from destructive interference of energy amplitudes , in a manner entirely analogous to the case of the particle in a one - dimensional box .",
    "it is hoped to further investigate conditions ( [ traj ] ) and ( [ init ] ) elsewhere . here",
    "a simple prediction generated by ( [ traj ] ) will be pointed out . in particular , if the energy eigenvalues @xmath247 increase slowly over ranges of length @xmath31 ( at least for values of @xmath9 for which the amplitudes @xmath254 are significant ) , and @xmath261 varies slowly over such ranges , then from ( [ traj ] ) one has @xmath262 .",
    "thus , if two channels coresponding to two values @xmath10 and @xmath263 intersect at some point in spacetime , their slopes at the point of intersection are predicted to be approximately in the ratio @xmath264 this provides a simple test of the applicability of this approach to a given quantum carpet structure : the strongest channels , corresponding to small values of @xmath31 , are predicted to intersect with slopes related by simple rational numbers . note from ( [ arb ] ) that conditions ( [ traj ] ) and ( [ init ] ) for destructive interference need in fact only hold over the range of @xmath9 for which the amplitudes @xmath254 are significant , to ensure effective destructive interference .",
    "this is fortunate , as these conditions can not in general hold for all @xmath9 ; however , it implies that this approach can in general only be applicable to superpositions of a relatively narrow band of energy eigenstates .",
