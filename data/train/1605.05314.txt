    "the size growth rate of galaxies is indicative of the mechanisms that drive galaxy evolution .",
    "quiescent galaxies with @xmath13 have demonstrated an accelerated growth having sizes @xmath14 times larger at @xmath15 compared to @xmath16 , while star - forming galaxies with similar masses have only grown by a factor of 2 since @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the dramatic size growth of quiescent galaxies is partly attributed to their decedent nature ; some fraction of their population form when already massive star - formers collide in major mergers or quench .",
    "once they have formed , it is thought that the majority of their size growth comes from adiabatic expansion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or minor and major merging events ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , studies have shown that the rate of minor mergers at @xmath18 is not sufficient to be the dominant means of growth for passive galaxies @xcite .",
    "therefore , the mechanisms that drive the accelerated growth of quiescent galaxies are still not well understood .    on the other hand , the steady growth of star - forming galaxies",
    "is attributed mainly to the production of new stars from cold gas reservoirs and inflowing streams , and possibly via minor mergers @xcite .",
    "while observations and simulations have provided some insight into the channels that drive galaxy growth , one important aspect is still debated : the role of environment .    at @xmath15",
    ", there is a clear relation between the morphology of galaxies and the environment they inhabit @xcite with elliptical galaxies being more prevalent in high density regions .",
    "it has become apparent that as early as @xmath19 these large scale structures began to form .",
    "therefore , the role of environment must be understood to better constrain the instruments that drive galaxy growth .",
    "it is thought that high density environments are efficient at removing the cold gas from star - forming galaxies via galaxy - galaxy interactions , strangulation , and harassment @xcite .",
    "the depletion of cold gas and quenching of star - forming galaxies , could stunt their size growth , creating an observable difference between their sizes / star - formation rates and those of field star - forming galaxies .",
    "in fact , the star - formation density relation has been observed from @xmath20 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , providing direct evidence that environment is effective at quenching star - forming galaxies .    however , the effects of environment on star - forming galaxies may not be completely destructive . at @xmath21 the cores of clusters are hosts to galaxies with star - formation rates ( sfrs ) up to @xmath22m@xmath23 yr@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the elevated sfrs of these galaxies could lead to bulge growth and a transformation from late - type morphologies to bulge dominated early - type morphologies .",
    "in fact , @xcite have confirmed a substantial population of star - forming early - type galaxies clusters at @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the mass@xmath8size relation of these cluster galaxies follows that of passive early - type cluster galaxies at @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , @xcite found that star - forming galaxies with @xmath27 have bulge to total ratios ( b / t ) of @xmath28 . assuming imminent quenching , then significant bulge growth and a transformation of late - type to early - type is expected for massive star - formers transitioning into quiescence .",
    "therefore , measuring the properties of star - forming galaxies at different cluster radii may provide answers to the level of impact environment plays on their size growth .",
    "simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate a strong dependence of median galaxy size on halo mass with quiescent galaxies in higher mass halos having larger sizes by a factor of @xmath29 .",
    "if quiescent galaxies are undergoing accelerated growth due to higher merger rates in clusters , then a measurable size difference should be present .",
    "therefore , it is important to compare the sizes of quiescent galaxies in different environments to understand if their accelerated growth can be attributed to major merger events .    to date , there are a number of studies that have used a combination of high resolution imaging , multi - band photometry , and spectroscopy to study the stellar mass - size relation as a function of environment .",
    "these studies span @xmath30 and show that the effect of environment on the sizes of quiescent galaxies is either weak or non - existent @xcite .",
    "there are few studies that have examined the effect of environment on star - forming galaxy sizes up to @xmath31 . at @xmath32 , @xcite",
    "find that field late - type galaxies with @xmath33 are up to @xmath34 larger in size than cluster late - type galaxies of similar mass . at @xmath35 , @xcite",
    "find no significant difference in the sizes of field and cluster late - type galaxies with @xmath36 . at @xmath37",
    ", @xcite found that the mass@xmath8normalised sizes of star - forming cluster galaxies with @xmath38 , are @xmath39 larger than their field counter - parts .",
    "the conflicting results and lack of a strong size difference could be due to an evolution in the sfr - density relation as well as differences in galaxy sample selection .    to understand if there is truly a size dependence on environment , it is important to determine at what epoch these differences emerged and to trace their evolution .",
    "however , finding and quantifying environment at @xmath40 is difficult because accurate redshifts are necessary , and spectroscopy becomes time expensive .",
    "the galaxy environment evolution collaboration 2 ( geec2 ) spectroscopic survey @xcite has identified 11 galaxy clusters in the cosmos field with @xmath41 ( @xmath42 , @xmath43  km  s@xmath3 ) .",
    "these clusters were found as part of a follow up survey that utilises the spectroscopic catalog of zcosmos @xcite and the x - ray catalog of @xcite . with the use of spectroscopy ,",
    "@xcite have confirmed over - densities that can be used to probe the effects of environment on galaxy evolution .",
    "while spectroscopy produces accurate redshifts , it is biased towards bright and/or blue objects .",
    "the photometric data obtained from ground based surveys such as the newfirm medium - band survey ( nmbs ) , can be used to calculate very accurate photometric redshifts , rest - frame colors , stellar masses , sfrs , and other galaxies properties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite , public imaging provides coverage in multiple wavelengths of several legacy fields .",

    "we now test if selecting by index / morphology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "we find that there is no significant change in our results .      in figure",
    "[ fig : n ] , we show the area - normalised distribution of indices and their averages for field and cluster , star - forming and quiescent galaxies obtained from galfit .",
    "errors in the average values are estimated using the error in the mean .",
    "in table  [ table : gal ] , we show these averages and their errors as well as the significance of their difference between field and cluster .",
    "the top panels of figure  [ fig : n ] are for 2  r@xmath4 cluster galaxies while the bottom panels are for 0.5  r@xmath4 cluster galaxies .",
    "the distribution of indices is similar for both field and cluster quiescent galaxies , regardless of cluster - centric radius .",
    "the fraction of quiescent field galaxies with @xmath161 is @xmath162 , compared to @xmath163 for the cluster outskirts , and @xmath164 for the cluster core . where the average index for field quiescent galaxies is @xmath165 compared to the cluster outskirts , @xmath166 , and cluster core , @xmath167 .",
    "the lack of a difference in the distributions or averages in index for field and cluster quiescent galaxies , regardless of cluster distance , suggests that these galaxies are most likely similar in morphologies , and we can not use index to differentiate their growth mechanisms .",
    "+    the distributions of indices and the average index of field and cluster star - forming galaxies at 2  r@xmath4 are consistent .",
    "we do note , however , that the 0.5  r@xmath4 cluster galaxies have a different distribution of @xmath116 relative to the field galaxies .",
    "galaxies within 0.5  r@xmath4 have an equal fraction of @xmath10 and @xmath168 indices .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the field , where the fraction of galaxies with @xmath168 is 0.69 , see figure  [ fig : n ] .",
    "the distribution in indices of the cluster core galaxies could be indicative of a distribution in spectral types , as observed in @xcite , while the field star - forming population may be more uniform .      by comparing the sfrs of field and cluster , star - forming galaxies we can quantify possible differential growth .",
    "we use the sfrs from the nmbs uv@xmath169ir sfr catalog for individual galaxies . for more details on the derivation of sfrs",
    ", please see @xcite .    because there is a known trend of increasing sfr with mass ( e.g. ,",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we compare sfrs between field and cluster by determining mass - normalised average sfrs .",
    "we fit the mass@xmath8sfr relations using the same parameterisation used to fit our mass@xmath8size relations .",

    "fig : sfr2 ] , we show the mass@xmath8sfr distributions and their best - fits for our samples of star - forming galaxies . the error in the average sfr is derived by bootstrapping the fit , and can be seen in figure  [ fig : sfr2 ] as filled and open contours .",
    "the average sfrs , their errors , and the significance at which they differ from each other can be seen in table  [ table : sfr ] .",
    "field galaxies have an average sfr of @xmath170  yr@xmath3 compared to @xmath171  yr@xmath3 for the cluster outskirts and @xmath172  yr@xmath3 for the cluster core .",
    "while this difference has a significance of @xmath12 , it can be seen in figure  [ fig : sfr ] , that the larger difference in sfr between field and cluster occurs for galaxies with @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the higher mass galaxies drive the difference in sfrs , and that the cluster environment is effective at suppressing or quenching the star - formation of massive galaxies , while lower mass cluster and field galaxies have similar sfrs .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sfr ] , we show the mass - normalised average sfrs as a function of clustocentric radius .",
    "the average sfr drops by a factor of two within 2  r@xmath4 , however , the the average sfrs between the cluster outskirts and core are consistent , suggesting that environmental effects extend to 2  r@xmath4 .",
    "we have used a sample of star - forming and quiescent , field and cluster galaxies at @xmath1 to study the influence of environment on galaxy properties . for the first time",
    ", we use different values of r@xmath4 to probe the effects of environment on galaxy sizes .",
    "it appears that only the star - forming galaxies found within 0.5  r@xmath4 of the cluster centres show a significant difference in size and index compared to their field counter - parts at @xmath1 .",
    "the difference of these two populations is further supported by the suppressed sfrs of cluster star - forming galaxies compared to field star - forming galaxies . on the other hand , quiescent field and cluster galaxies have consistent sizes indices , and sfrs , independent of cluster - centric radius .",

    "this result is consistent with other studies regardless of sample selection or redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to illustrate this , we plot the difference in r@xmath178 between field and cluster quiescent galaxies at several redshifts , see figure  [ fig : del ] .",
    "we adopted this approach from @xcite and use their data and as well as the work of this study , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    when we assume zero slope and preform a linear fit to the data we find an average difference of @xmath179 kpc ( @xmath180 ) between the sizes of field and cluster quiescent galaxies .",
    "for an average quiescent cluster galaxy with = 10.7 and r@xmath181 kpc , this difference would only represent a size offset of @xmath182 from a field quiescent galaxy with the same mass .",
    "we conclude that environment does not affect the size evolution of quiescent galaxies .",
    "the two data points from @xcite deviate from zero size difference by a significant amount ( see figure  [ fig : del ] ) .",
    "the halo masses of the clusters in their study are on the order of @xmath183 m@xmath23 where those in our work are on the order of @xmath67 m@xmath23 .",
    "larger sizes are expected for cluster galaxies that reside in larger mass halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , therefore , the lack of size difference measured in our work could be due to the lower mass halos of our clusters .    while it seems that there is little to no size difference between field and cluster quiescent galaxies ,",
    "more studies are needed that consider the effects of different mass halos and different cluster - centric radii to constrain this apparent lack of environmental effects .",
    "we found no significant difference between the sizes and indices of star - forming galaxies in the outer cluster region ( @xmath5r@xmath4@xmath184 ) and field .",
    "however , within the cluster core ( r@xmath4@xmath7 ) , star - forming galaxies have smaller sizes and indices with equal frequency above and below @xmath185 , compared to the field . here , we explore what phenomena would cause environment to have a significant effect on star - forming galaxy sizes at r@xmath4@xmath7 , and star - forming galaxy sfrs within 2  r@xmath4 .",
    "the smaller sizes of the cluster core galaxies may be due to a combination of tidal stripping and harassment .",
    "therefore , a difference in dynamical timescales of galaxies that reside in the outer cluster regions versus the cluster core could explain the difference in their structural properties .",
    "we use the velocity dispersions calculated in @xcite to estimate the different dynamical times , @xmath186 , as a function of r@xmath4 for galaxies in this study .",
    "galaxies in the outer cluster have @xmath187 gyr compared to @xmath188 gyr for galaxies in the cluster core .",
    "therefore , galaxies in the cluster core have most likely been exposed to environmental effects such as tidal stripping and harassment more frequently than those in the outer cluster .",
    "environmental effects would also cause suppressed star - formation that could be contributing to the smaller sizes ( in rest - frame b - band ) .",
    "this is consistent with our results where the average sfr of the core is a factor of 2.5 lower than the field .",
    "however , the average sfr of the cluster outskirts is also suppressed compared to the field , but the average sizes between the outskirts and field are consistent .",
    "this may be a result of a timescale issue where galaxies in the cluster outskirts have begun to quench , but that is not yet reflected in their sizes . this is consistent with @xcite who found that satellite galaxies remain star - forming for @xmath189 gyr after their first cluster infall and then rapidly quench .",
    "furthermore , the difference in sfr between the field and cluster is likely driven by galaxies with @xmath110 , while the sfrs of lower mass galaxies are similar regardless of environment .",
    "this is consistent with previous studies that find higher quenching efficiencies and lower specific sfrs for massive star - forming galaxies in groups ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , it is likely that environmental effects extend to 2  r@xmath4 , however , the timescale for which a difference in size can be seen is longer than for the cluster core .",
    "there are few studies that compare the sizes of field and cluster star - forming galaxies at any redshift . in figure",
    "[ fig : del ] , we show all of the current studies that measure the size difference for field and cluster star - forming galaxies . from these few results",
    "it is unclear what role environment plays in the growth of star - forming galaxies . to understand what is driving this size difference in the cores of clusters at @xmath1 and if it is occurring at lower or high redshifts , more studies that consider the effects of environment as a function of r@xmath4 are needed .",
    "while we chose to use clustocentric distance to define environment , it has been shown that surface density more strongly traces changes in galaxy populations in over - dense environments , such as spectral type and index @xcite . to really understand how clusters affect their galaxies , it is important to understand how both environmental density and clustocentric radius play a role .",
    "we have studied the dependence of the mass@xmath8size relation on environment at different intervals of cluster r@xmath4 using @xmath190 field and cluster galaxies at @xmath1 . from the geec2 and nmbs surveys , we utilised accurate rest frame colors and stellar masses to select our mass - complete sample ( down to @xmath0 ) of star - forming and quiescent galaxies .",
    "our main results are as follows .",
    "+ for quiescent galaxies :    *  we rule out a size difference of more than 6% , regardless of the cluster - centric radius . combining previous results from the literature",
    ", we determine that quiescent cluster galaxies are at most @xmath191 kpc larger in size than their field counter - parts .",
    "*  field and cluster galaxies are consistent in index , regardless of the cluster - centric radius .      *  we find that the mass normalised ( @xmath192 average size of cluster star - forming galaxies within 0.5  r@xmath4 is @xmath9 smaller , than field star - forming galaxies",
    ". however , this difference disappears if cluster star - forming galaxies are at a larger radius of 2  r@xmath4 . *",
    "the fraction of galaxies with indices with @xmath10 for cluster star - forming galaxies within 0.5  r@xmath4 is @xmath193 compared to a fraction of @xmath194 for field star - forming galaxies .",
    "again , this difference disappears for a cluster sample at larger radius . *  the mass - normalised average sfr of field star - forming galaxies",
    "is elevated by a factor of 2 ( significance of @xmath12 ) compared to cluster star - forming galaxies , regardless of clustocentric radius .",
    "however , this trend appears to be driven by the high mass end , indicating that environment is more efficient at quenching galaxies with @xmath110 .",
    "our results are consistent with previous works which all show that the dependence of the mass@xmath8size relation on environment for quiescent galaxies is minimal at best .",
    "this continues to be surprising because quiescent galaxies are thought to be built up via mergers which should occur more frequently in clusters .",
    "these mergers are likely responsible , at least in part , for producing the morphology - density relation .",
    "it is , however , clear that the cluster environment plays an important role controlling the gas content of galaxies .",
    "thus , perhaps it is more useful to study star - forming galaxies where environment can have its greatest effect on gas content , sfrs and sizes and possibly transition active galaxies into passive ones .",
    "while there are few studies that examine the mass@xmath8size relation of star - forming galaxies as a function of redshift , we can use those results to infer that environment does appear to influence the size of star - forming galaxies .",
    "the lower average sfrs of cluster star - forming galaxies could mean that they have lost access to cold gas reservoirs in the cluster core and can not grow via star - formation at the same rate as galaxies in the field .",
    "additional studies are needed to constrain the effects of environment on the growth mechanisms of star - forming galaxies , preferentially spanning @xmath195 so that it is clear at what epoch massive cluster star - forming galaxies are becoming quenched .",
