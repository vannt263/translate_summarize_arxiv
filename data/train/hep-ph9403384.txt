    "among the quantities studied in the rich field of rare and cp - violating decays @xcite the branching ratio @xmath9 , the ratio @xmath5 of @xmath10 to @xmath11 mixing and a class of cp - asymmetries in neutral b - decays , all being essentially free from any hadronic uncertainties , stand out as ideally suited for the determination of the ckm parameters .",
    "simultaneously they appear to be in the reach of experimentalists in the next five to ten years .",
    "the decays @xmath12 and @xmath13 are also theoretically very clean but much harder to measure .",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath5 are probably the best quantities for the determination of the ckm element @xmath15 and consequently play important roles in constraining the shape of the unitarity triangle .",
    "the decay @xmath16 is dominated by short distance loop diagrams involving the heavy top quark and receives also sizable contributions from internal charm quark exchanges .",
    "the qcd corrections to this decay have been calculated in the leading logarithmic approximation long time ago @xcite .",
    "the recent calculation @xcite of next - to - leading qcd corrections reduced considerably the theoretical uncertainty due to the choice of the renormalization scales present in the leading order expression .",
    "since the relevant hadronic matrix element of the operator @xmath17 can be measured in the leading decay @xmath18 , the resulting theoretical expression for @xmath14 is only a function of the ckm parameters , the qcd scale @xmath19 and the quark masses @xmath0 and @xmath20 .",
    "moreover due to the work of ref .",
    "@xcite the scales in @xmath0 and @xmath20 are under control so that the sensitivity of @xmath14 to @xmath20 stressed in refs .",
    "@xcite is considerably reduced .",
    "the long distance contributions to @xmath21 have been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite and found to be very small : two to three orders of magnitude smaller than the short distance contribution at the level of the branching ratio .    the top quark mass dependence and the qcd corrections to @xmath22 mixing cancel in the ratio @xmath5 which depends only on the ckm parameters and su(3)-flavour breaking effects in the relevant hadronic matrix elements .",
    "these su(3 ) breaking effects contain much smaller theoretical uncertainties than the hadronic matrix elements present in @xmath23 and @xmath24 separately .",
    "the measurement of @xmath5 gives then a good determination of the ratio @xmath25 and consequently of one side of the unitarity triangle .",
    "the cp - asymmetry in the decay @xmath26 allows in the standard model a direct measurement of the angle @xmath27 in the unitarity triangle without any theoretical uncertainties @xcite .",
    "similarly the decay @xmath28 gives the angle @xmath29 , although in this case strategies involving other channels are necessary in order to remove hadronic uncertainties related to penguin contributions @xcite .",

    "we would like to address the following questions :    * what accuracy of theoretical predictions for @xmath39 ) , @xmath24 , @xmath40 and the unitarity triangle could one expect around the year 2000 assuming reasonable improvements for the values of @xmath33 , @xmath41 , @xmath0 and the non - perturbative parameters in question ? * what would be the impact of a measurement of @xmath38 ) on the ckm parameters and in particular on the value of @xmath42 ? * what would be the impact of a measurement of @xmath24 ?",

    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we extend the wolfenstein parametrization and the analysis of the unitarity triangle beyond the leading order in @xmath8 and we give improved formulae for @xmath40 . in section 3",
    "we collect the formulae for @xmath49 , @xmath50 mixing and @xmath51 beyond leading order in @xmath8 . in section 4",
    "we list several analytic results which can be derived using wolfenstein parametrization beyond leading @xmath8 , which to a very good accuracy represent exact numerical analysis . in section 5",
    "we systematically address the questions posed above .",
    "we end the paper with a brief summary and a number of conclusions .",
    "we will dominantly use the standard parametrization @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 with @xmath55 and @xmath56 being generation labels ( @xmath57 ) . @xmath58 and @xmath59",
    "can all be chosen to be positive .",
    "the measurements of the cp violation in k decays force @xmath60 to be in the range @xmath61 .",
    "the extensive phenomenology of the last years has shown that @xmath62 and @xmath63 are small numbers : @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively . consequently to an excellent accuracy @xmath66 and",
    "the four independent parameters are given as follows @xmath67 with the phase @xmath60 extracted from cp violating transitions or loop processes sensitive to @xmath42 .",
    "the latter fact is based on the observation that for @xmath68 , as required by the analysis of cp violation , there is a one  to ",
    "one correspondence between @xmath60 and @xmath69 given by @xmath70      we will also use the wolfenstein parametrization @xcite .",
    "it is an approximate parametrization of the ckm matrix in which each element is expanded as a power series in the small parameter @xmath71 : @xmath72 and the set ( [ 2.73 ] ) is replaced by @xmath73 the wolfenstein parameterization has several nice features . in particular",
    "it offers in conjunction with the unitarity triangle a very transparent geometrical representation of the structure of the ckm matrix and allows to derive several analytic results to be discussed below .",
    "this turns out to be very useful in the phenomenology of rare decays and of cp violation .    when using the wolfenstein parametrization one should remember that it is an approximation and that in certain situations neglecting @xmath74 terms may give wrong results .",
    "the question then arises how to find @xmath74 and higher order terms ?",
    "the point is that like in any perturbative expansion the @xmath74 and higher order terms are not unique .",
    "this is the reason why in different papers in the literature different @xmath74 terms can be found .",
    "the non - uniqueness of higher order terms in @xmath8 is not troublesome however . as in any perturbation theory",
    "different choices of expanding in @xmath8 will result in different numerical values for the parameters in ( [ 2.76 ] ) extracted from the data without changing the physics when all terms are summed up . here",
    "it suffices to find an expansion in @xmath8 which allows for simple relations between the parameters ( [ 2.73 ] ) and ( [ 2.76 ] ) .",
    "this will also restore the unitarity of the ckm matrix which in the wolfenstein parametrization as given in ( [ 2.75 ] ) is not satisfied exactly .    to this end",
    "we go back to ( [ 2.72 ] ) and we impose the relations @xmath75 to _ all orders _ in @xmath8 . in view of the comments made above this can certainly be done .",
    "it follows that @xmath76 we observe that ( [ 2.77 ] ) and ( [ 2.84 ] ) represent simply the change of variables from ( [ 2.73 ] ) to ( [ 2.76 ] ) . making this change of variables in the standard parametrization ( [ 2.72 ] ) we find the ckm matrix as a function of @xmath77 which satisfies unitarity exactly !",
    "we also note that in view of @xmath78 the relations between @xmath59 and @xmath79 in ( [ 2.73 ] ) are satisfied to high accuracy . the relations in ( [ 2.84 ] )",
    "have been first used in ref .",
    "however , our improved treatment of the unitarity triangle presented below goes beyond the analysis of these authors .",
    "the procedure outlined above gives automatically the corrections to the wolfenstein parametrization in ( [ 2.75 ] ) . indeed expressing ( [ 2.72 ] ) in terms of wolfenstein parameters using ( [ 2.77 ] ) and then expanding in powers of @xmath8 we recover the matrix in ( [ 2.75 ] ) and in addition find explicit corrections of @xmath74 and higher order terms .",
    "@xmath80 remains unchanged .",
    "the corrections to @xmath81 and @xmath46 appear only at @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively . for many practical purposes the corrections to the real parts can also be neglected .",
    "the essential corrections to the imaginary parts are : @xmath84 these two corrections have to be taken into account in the discussion of cp violation . on the other hand the imaginary part of @xmath85 which in our expansion in @xmath8 appears only at @xmath86 can be fully neglected .    in order to improve the accuracy of the unitarity triangle discussed below we",
    "will also include the @xmath87 correction to @xmath15 which gives @xmath88 with @xmath89 in order to derive analytic results we need accurate explicit expressions for @xmath90 where @xmath91 .",
    "we have @xmath92 @xmath93 @xmath94 expressions ( [ 2.51 ] ) and ( [ 2.52 ] ) represent to an accuracy of 0.2% the exact formulae obtained using ( [ 2.72 ] ) .",
    "the expression ( [ 2.53 ] ) deviates by at most 2% from the exact formula in the full range of parameters considered . in order to keep the analytic expressions in sections 3 and 4 in a transparent form",
    "we have dropped a small @xmath82 term in deriving ( [ 2.53 ] ) . after inserting the expressions ( [ 2.51])([2.53 ] ) in exact formulae for quantities of interest , further expansion in @xmath8 should not be made .",
    "the unitarity of the ckm - matrix provides us with several relations of which @xmath95 is the most useful one . in the complex plane",
    "the relation ( [ 2.87h ] ) can be represented as a triangle , the so - called `` unitarity  triangle '' ( ut ) .",
    "phenomenologically this triangle is very interesting as it involves simultaneously the elements @xmath80 , @xmath46 and @xmath15 which are under extensive discussion at present .    in the usual analyses of the unitarity triangle only terms @xmath96",
    "are kept in ( [ 2.87h ] ) @xcite .",
    "it is however straightforward to include the next - to - leading @xmath87 terms .",
    "we note first that @xmath97 thus to an excellent accuracy @xmath98 is real with @xmath99 . keeping @xmath87 corrections and rescaling all terms in ( [ 2.87h ] ) by @xmath100",
    "we find @xmath101 with @xmath102 and @xmath103 defined in ( [ 2.88d ] ) .",
