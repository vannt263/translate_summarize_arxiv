    "the past decade has witnessed a synergy of x - ray and radio observations revealing a diversity of young isolated neutron stars with magnetic fields spanning five orders of magnitude .",
    "these include the magnetars ( the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and the soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) ) , high - magnetic field radio pulsars ( hbps ) , rotating radio transients , and the central compact objects in supernova remnants ( snrs ) , in addition to the more ` classical ' rotation - powered pulsars like the crab .",
    "x - ray observations of the hbp j18460258 in the snr kes 75 showed the first evidence of a magnetar - like behaviour from a crab - like pulsar , suggesting that the class of hbps is linked to magnetars ( kumar & safi - harb 2008 , gavriil et al .",
    "more recently , a magnetar was discovered with a relatively low magnetic field ( rea et al .",
    "2010 ) , a surprising result questioning the need for a high dipolar field ( @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3=4.4@xmath410@xmath5  g ) for magnetar - like activity .",
    "this also suggests that these objects are more common than commonly believed and that there is likely an evolutionary link between the different classes of neutron stars .",
    "while observationally there is so far no consensus on magnetars progenitors , there is accumulating evidence for them originating from very massive progenitors ( @xmath6@xmath730@xmath8 ) , as inferred for sgr  180620 and cxou j164710.2455216 associated with very massive clusters ( figer et al .",
    "2005 , muno et al .",
    "2006 ) , the presence of a stellar - wind blown bubble around axp 1e 1048.15937 ( gaensler et al .",
    "2005 ) , and the wolf - rayet progenitor inferred for kes  75 hosting hbp j18460258 ( morton et al .",
    "however a lower progenitor mass of 17 @xmath8 has been suggested for sgr  1900 + 14 ( davies et al .",
    "2009 ) .    to further address the link between hbps and magnetars and their progenitors , we investigate their associated snrs in x - rays .",
    "x - ray spectroscopy provides a powerful tool to infer the mass of the progenitor .",
    "this is achieved by fitting the x - ray spectra of young , ejecta - dominated , snrs and comparing the fitted metal abundances to nucleosynthesis model yields .",
    "furthermore , the parameters inferred from fitting the x - ray spectrum of the blast wave yield other intrinsic properties of the snr ( explosion energy , age , ambient density ) , thus shedding light on their environment and evolutionary stage .    currently , there is only a handful of associations : two snrs securely associated with hbps : g292.20.5/j11196127 and kes  75/j18460258 , and four snrs associated with magnetars : kes  73/1e  1841045 , ctb  109/1e  2259 + 586 , g327.20.1/1e  1547.05408 , and g337.00.1/sgr  162741 .",
    "other proposed associations are : w41/magnetar swift j1834.90846 , g29.6 + 0.1 and ctb  37b with magnetars candidates ax  j18450258 and cxou j171405.7381031 , respectively , the candidate snr g333.9 + 0.0/radio magnetar psr j16224950 , g42.8 + 0.6/sgr  1900 + 14 , g353.60.7/magnetar candidate xmmu j173203.3344518 , and n49/sgr 052666 in the lmcpulsar / magnetar / main.html for the magnetars catalogue , and http://www.physics.umanitoba.ca/snr/snrcat for the galactic snrs high - energy catalogue , associations with compact objects , and references not listed here due to space limit . ] .",
    "we here briefly summarize our dedicated studies of g292.2@xmath00.5 and kes  73 ( kumar et al .",
    "2012a , b ) , and conclude with a summary of the properties of their associated snrs studied in x - rays .",
    "the snr g292.20.5 is associated with the hbp j11196127 which has a rotation period @xmath9@xmath10408 ms , a characteristic age @xmath11@xmath101.6  kyr ( with an upper limit on its age of 1.9  kyr ) , and a dipole magnetic field @xmath1@xmath104.1@xmath410@xmath5  g. the combined _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _",
    "study shows that the plasma is best described by a two - component thermal+non - thermal model .",
    "the thermal component is fitted with a non - equilibrium ionization model with a high temperature @xmath12 ranging from 1.3  kev in the western side to 2.3 kev in the east , a column density increasing from 1.0@xmath410@xmath13  cm@xmath13 in the west to 1.8@xmath410@xmath13  @xmath15 in the east , and a low ionization timescale ranging from 5.7@xmath410@xmath16  @xmath17  s in the snr interior to 3.6@xmath410@xmath18  @xmath17  s in the western side .",
    "an additional hard non - thermal component for the eastern and western sides of the pulsar can be partly attributed to leakage of relativistic particles from the pulsar or its associated nebula .",
    "the spatial and spectral differences across the snr are consistent with the presence of a dark cloud in the eastern part of the snr absorbing the soft x - ray emission .",
    "the metal abundances inferred for the western side of the snr are consistent with solar or sub - solar values , characterizing the emission from the supernova blast wave ; while the interior regions indicate the presence of slightly enhanced abundances from ne , mg , si , hinting for the first time at the presence of reverse - shocked ejecta .",
    "we infer a high progenitor mass of @xmath1030@xmath8 suggesting a type ib / c supernova , an snr age of @xmath1047  kyr , and a low ambient density ( table  1 ) .",
    "the discrepancy between the snr and pulsar s age can be attributed to a variable braking index for the pulsar which recently showed unusual timing characteristics in the radio .    for the snr",
    "kes  73 associated with axp 1e 1841@xmath0045 ( @xmath9@xmath1011.8  s , @xmath11@xmath104.7  kyr , @xmath1@xmath107@xmath410@xmath19  g ) , our _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ spatially resolved spectroscopic study requires a two - component non - equilibrium ionization thermal model .",
    "the soft - component has temperatures @xmath100.30.5 kev and ionization timescales @xmath2010@xmath21  @xmath17  s with enhanced metal abundances ; while the hard - component exhibits plasma temperatures @xmath101.11.7  kev and low ionization timescales @xmath10(0.52.8)@xmath410@xmath22  @xmath17  s with solar abundances .",
    "these results indicate that the soft - component arises from the reverse - shocked ejecta with most regions showing plasma that has reached ionization equilibrium , while the hard - component originates from the blast wave shocking an ambient medium with an average density of @xmath23@xmath100.5  @xmath17 .",
    "we infer a progenitor mass of @xmath10(2530 ) @xmath8 , supporting the earlier prediction of a sn type iil / b for the remnant , and an snr age of @xmath242.1  kyr ( table  1 ) .",
    "in summary most current studies point to highly magnetized neutron stars originating from very massive progenitors .",
    "table  1 highlights the snr properties of the x - ray studied associations .",
    "these results also suggest young snrs ( age @xmath2510  kyr ) expanding in a relatively low - density medium for the galactic snrs .",
    "further dedicated studies in x - rays and other wavelengths , as well as improved nucleosynthesis models , are needed to confirm these calculations and increase the sample of neutron star  snr associations .",
    "_ notes : _",
    "@xmath26 is the volume filling factor .",
    "the lower and upper age estimates for g292.20.5 and kes  73 correspond to the free expansion and sedov phases , respectively . for the other snrs",
    ", the age was mainly estimated assuming the sedov phase ( for ctb  37b using the ionization timescale ) .",
