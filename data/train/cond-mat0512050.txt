    "<S> i use an interpolation formula , introduced recently by guerra and toninelli in order to prove the existence of the free energy of the sherrington  kirkpatrick spin glass model in the infinite volume limit , to investigate numerically the finite size corrections to the free energy of this model . </S>",

    "<S> many years after their experimental discovery , spin glasses remain a challenge for experimentalists , theoreticians and more recently computer scientists and mathematicians . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations have been used heavily in order to investigate their physical properties . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations are obviously limited to finite systems . </S>",
    "<S> simulations of spin glasses are indeed limited to very small systems , due to the need to repeat the simulation for many disorder samples ( this is related , at least for mean field models , to the lack of self - averaging ) , and to the bad behavior , as the system size grows , of all known algorithms . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed understanding of finite size effects of spin glass models is accordingly highly desirable . </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath23 loops term goes like @xmath24 , with the most diverging contribution as @xmath25 ( namely @xmath26 ) coming from the order @xmath27 term in the hamiltonian . summing up these contributions , one obtains  @xcite at the critical temperature    @xmath28    the computation  @xcite of the constant @xmath29 requires a non - perturbative extrapolation . </S>",
