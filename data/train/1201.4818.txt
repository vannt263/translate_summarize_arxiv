    "the discrete markus - yamabe conjecture and remains unproven .",
    "it may be stated as follows :    discrete markus - yamabe conjecture : let @xmath6 be a @xmath7 map from @xmath8 to itself such that @xmath9 . if all the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix at every point have modulus less than one , then the origin is a global attractor .",

    "let @xmath256 be the set of @xmath2-invariant function germs from the plane to the reals .",
    "this is a ring generated by the following hilbert basis @xmath257 in the sense that every germ in @xmath256 can be written in the form @xmath258 where @xmath259 is a smooth function of three variables .",
    "two map - germs , @xmath107 and @xmath262 , are @xmath2-contact - equivalent if ( see mather @xcite , even though we follow the notation in @xcite , chapter xiv ) there exists an invertible change of coordinates @xmath263 , fixing the origin and @xmath2-equivariant , and a matrix - valued germ @xmath264 satisfying for all @xmath265 @xmath266 with @xmath267 and @xmath268 in the same connected component as the identity in the space of linear maps of the plane , and such that @xmath269 the set of matrices satisfying the @xmath2-equivariance described above is denoted and generated as follows @xmath270 with @xmath271 note that , in the @xmath272-equivariant context , all map germs preserve the origin . in such cases as these , the tangent space @xmath273 to the @xmath2-contact orbit coincides with the restricted tangent space , @xmath274 .      given @xmath43 and dividing both components by @xmath118 as it does not affect the singularity , we have @xmath280 note that all rows of this matrix have the common factor @xmath281 , which does not affect the singularity .",
    "also , all the products with @xmath43 will exhibit the common factor @xmath282 , which again does not affect the singularity .",
    "we therefore present the generators of @xmath283 after a multiplication by the corresponding common factor . to exemplify ,",
    "@xmath284 is reported as @xmath285 .",
    "this stated , we have the following list of generators of @xmath283 , where the symbol @xmath254 indicates that a simplification was made through a product by a non - zero invariant : @xmath286 ; \\\\ ( df_4)x_4 & = & \\frac{1}{4}[(n^3 + 6a+3n^2)x_1+(2a-3n^2 - 9n)x_3 ] ; \\\\ s_1f_4 & = & 3nx_2+x_4 \\\\ s_2f_4 & = & -3bx_1-ax_2+nx_4 \\\\ s_3f_4 & = & \\frac{1}{4}(nx_4-n^2x_2 ) \\sim n^2x_2-nx_4 \\\\ s_4f_4 & = & ( -\\frac{1}{16}n^3-\\frac{5}{32}na)x_2+\\frac{1}{8}bx_3+\\frac{7}{32}n^2x_4 \\\\ t_1f_4 & = & \\frac{1}{4}(3nx_1+x_3 ) \\sim 3nx_1+x_3 \\\\ t_2f_4 & = & -bx_2 ; \\\\ t_3f_4 & = & \\frac{1}{4}(a - n^2)x_1-bx_2 ; \\\\ t_4f_4 & = & \\frac{1}{16}[(na - n^3)x_1 - 14nbx_2 - 2bx_4].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we use a filtration by degree @xmath287 of @xmath288 where @xmath289 is the set of germs in @xmath288 with all coordinates homogeneous polynomials of the same degree @xmath290 and @xmath291 . note that @xmath292 for all @xmath293 and each @xmath294 is a finitely generated @xmath256-module .",
    "moreover , denoting as @xmath295 the unique maximal ideal in @xmath288 , we have @xmath296 we show that @xmath297 by showing that @xmath298 and invoking nakayama s lemma .",
    "we have that @xmath299 is generated over @xmath256 as @xmath300 we point out that there are no equivariants of degree @xmath301 and therefore @xmath302 contains germs of degree @xmath303 or higher .",
    "multiply by @xmath304 the lower order generators of @xmath283 , that is , @xmath305 , @xmath306 , @xmath307 and @xmath308 and append @xmath309 at the end of the list ; add or subtract as necessary terms in @xmath310 to the generators of @xmath283 . after performing these two operations",
    ", we obtain the matrix @xmath311 below , where the entry @xmath312 is the coefficient of generator @xmath290 in ( [ generators ] ) coming from the term @xmath313 in the list of generators of @xmath283 : @xmath314 the matrix @xmath311 is of rank @xmath315 , establishing our claim that @xmath297 .",

    "a universal unfolding is given by @xmath319 of course a choice using @xmath320 as a complement is just as good from the point of view of singularity theory .",
