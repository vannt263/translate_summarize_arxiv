    "the forward search algorithm was suggested for the multivariate location model by hadi @xcite and for multiple regression by hadi and simonoff @xcite and developed further by atkinson @xcite and atkinson and riani @xcite , see also atkinson , riani and cerioli @xcite .",
    "it is an algorithm for avoiding outliers in a regression analysis by recursively constructing subsets of `` good '' observations .",
    "the algorithm starts with a robust estimate of the regression parameters based on all observations , and constructs the set of observations with the smallest @xmath0 absolute residuals .",
    "it continues by estimating the parameters by least squares based on the @xmath0 observations selected . from this estimate ,",
    "the absolute residuals of all observations are computed and ordered .",
    "the @xmath1st largest absolute residual is the forward residual and it is used to monitor the algorithm .",
    "the set of @xmath2 observations with the smallest absolute residuals is the starting point for the next iteration .",
    "the results of the analysis are plots of the recursively estimated forward residuals and robust parameter estimates .",
    "this paper provides an asymptotic theory for these forward plots when applied to multiple regression under the assumption of no outliers .",
    "the forward search is used as a diagnostic tool in regression analysis .",
    "the idea is that most observations are `` good '' in the sense that they conform with a regression model with symmetric , if not normal , errors .",
    "some observations may not conform with the model  they are the outliers .",
    "when building a statistical model , the user can apply the forward search in combination with considerations about the substantive context to decide which observations are `` good '' and how to treat the `` outliers '' in the analysis . in order to use the algorithm , we need to understand its properties when all observations are `` good '' with symmetric or even normal errors .",
    "currently this understanding comes from simulations reported in , for instance , the above mentioned papers . in the present paper , we analyse the algorithm using asymptotic tools . in the future",
    ", we hope to analyse the algorithm in the presence of outliers that may or may not be of a symmetric nature .      in this paper ,",
    "the forward plots are analysed for a multiple regression model .",
    "the model for the `` good '' observations has symmetric zero mean errors with unknown scale , while the regressors can be stationary as well as stochastically and deterministically trending .",
    "the plots of forward residuals and estimators are embedded as stochastic processes in @xmath3 $ ] , and their asymptotic properties are derived using new results on empirical processes and martingales .",
    "the results can be applied to construct pointwise and simultaneous confidence bands for the forward plots .",
    "the first result is that the process of forward residuals behaves asymptotically as if the parameters were known .",
    "that is , as the process of ordered absolute errors from an i.i.d .",
    "sample from the error distribution .",
    "such empirical quantile processes are studied by analysing the empirical distribution function as an empirical process . in order to show that the estimation uncertainty is negligible",
    ", we introduce a class of weighted and marked empirical processes , where the weights represent functions of the regressors and the marks are functions of the regression error .",
    "a technical difficulty is , that because the empirical processes are constructed from estimated residuals , the argument of the empirical process is stochastically varying .",
    "we develop the theory of such processes , applying and generalizing the results of koul and ossiander @xcite .    in the second result",
    ", the process of forward residuals is scaled by recursive estimates of the unknown standard error .",
    "the limiting process is gaussian and the variance function is found .    in the study of weighted and marked empirical processes , the well - known method of replacing the discontinuous processes by their smooth compensators",
    "is applied .",
    "the difference is a martingale . to justify this replacement , some new iterated exponential martingale inequalities for the variation of the maximum of finitely",
    "many martingales are developed by an iterative application of an exponential inequality of bercu and touati @xcite .",
    "the forward search starts with a robust estimator .",
    "examples of robust regression estimators are the least median squares estimator and the least trimmed squares estimator of rousseeuw @xcite .",
    "these estimators are known to have good breakdown properties , see rousseeuw and leroy  @xcite , section  3.4 and an asymptotic theory for the least trimmed squares regression estimator is provided by vek @xcite .",
    "we will allow initial estimators @xmath4 converging at a rate slower than the usual @xmath5-rate , for the stationary case , as , for example , the least median squares estimator , which is @xmath6-consistent in location - scale models .",
    "broadly speaking , we require three asymptotic tools . first , a theory for weighted and marked empirical processes to describe the least squares statistics .",
    "second , an analysis of the corresponding quantile processes to describe the forward residuals .",
    "third , a fixed point result to describe the iteration involved .    in empirical process theory , the weights represent functions of the regressors and the marks are functions of the regression error .",
    "the results generalise those of johansen and nielsen @xcite who did not allow stochastic variation in the quantiles and those of koul and ossiander @xcite who did not allow marks .",
    "the proof combines a chaining argument with iterations of an exponential inequality for martingales by bercu and touati @xcite .",
    "the quantile process theory draws on the exposition of csrg @xcite .",
    "it is found that in the case of a known variance , the forward residuals satisfy a bahadur representation , so that , asymptotically , the forward residuals have the same distribution as the order statistics of the absolute regression errors .",
    "when the variance is estimated , an additional term appears in the asymptotic distribution .",
    "the last ingredient is a fixed point result to describe the iterative result .",
    "a single step of the algorithm has been discussed for the location - scale case by johansen and nielsen @xcite . starting with bickel @xcite ,",
    "see also simpson , ruppert and carroll @xcite , there are a number of asymptotic results for one - step l- and m - estimators .",
    "these are predominantly concerned with objective functions that have continuous derivatives , thereby excluding hard rejection as for the one - step huber - skip function .",
    "the forward search gives a sequence of one - step estimators .",
    "because the estimators are based on least squares in a sample selected by truncating the residuals , each estimator is a one - step huber - skip estimator .",
    "such estimators have been studied by ruppert and carroll @xcite , johansen and nielsen @xcite , theorem  3.3 , welsh and ronchetti @xcite , and hawkins and olive @xcite .",
    "there appears to be less work on iteration of one - step estimators .",
    "the case of smooth weights was considered by dollinger and staudte @xcite , but the case of 01 weights does not appear to have been studied until recently . cavaliere and georgiev @xcite analysed a sequence of huber - skip estimators for a first order autoregression with infinite variance errors , while johansen and nielsen  @xcite , theorem  3.3 , analysed sequences of one - step huber - skip estimators with a fixed critical value .",
    "here we need a critical value which changes with @xmath7 , the chosen number of observations , so we need a generalisation of the fixed point result of the latter paper .",
    "outline of the paper : the model and the forward search algorithm are defined in section  [ smodel ] .",
    "the main asymptotic results are given in section  [ smainresults ] .",
    "the weighted and marked empirical process results are given in section  [ sempproc ] , while the iterated exponential martingale inequalities are presented in section  [ smartingale ] with proofs following in appendices [ appendixa][sfproof ] .",
    "the proofs of the main results follow in appendix  [ sgproof ] .",
    "finally , appendix  [ st - order ] gives a result on order statistics of @xmath8-distributed variables .",
    "the multiple regression model is presented , and the forward search algorithm is defined including the forward residual and forward deletion residual .",
    "we assume that @xmath9 , @xmath10 satisfy the multiple regression equation with regressors of dimension @xmath11 @xmath12 the errors , @xmath13 , are assumed independent and identically distributed with mean zero and variance  @xmath14 , and @xmath15 has known density @xmath16 and distribution function @xmath17 . in practice , the distribution @xmath18 will often be standard normal .",
    "the forward search is an algorithm based on ordering absolute residuals and calculation of least squares estimators from the selected observations .",
    "both these choices implicitly assume a symmetric density . because , unless symmetry is assumed , truncating the errors symmetrically gives in general an error distribution with mean different from zero and hence biased least squares estimators , at least for the location parameter .",
    "the distribution function of the absolute errors @xmath19 of a symmetric density is @xmath20 with density @xmath21 .",
    "we define the quantiles of the absolute errors as@xmath22 and the truncated moments @xmath23 then the conditional variance of @xmath24 given @xmath25 is @xmath26 this will serve as a bias correction for the variance estimator based on the truncated sample . using lhpital s rule , it is seen that @xmath27 if @xmath28 is gaussian , then @xmath29 .",
    "the forward search algorithm is designed to avoid outliers in a linear multiple regression .",
    "the first step is given by the choice of a robust estimator , @xmath4 , of the regression parameter , and the choice of the size @xmath0 of the initial set of `` good '' observations .",
    "the algorithm generates a sequence of sets of `` good '' observations and least squares regression estimators based on these .",
    "the @xmath30st step of the algorithm is given as follows .",
    "[ alestimators ] given an estimator @xmath31 compute absolute residuals @xmath32 , @xmath10 .",
    "find the @xmath30st smallest order statistic @xmath33 .",
    "find the set of @xmath34 observations with smallest residuals @xmath35 .",
    "compute the new least squares estimators on @xmath36 @xmath37    note , that @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the full sample least squares estimators , and that for @xmath40 , see theorem  [ tshat ] , @xmath41 we therefore introduce also the ( asymptotically ) bias corrected variance estimator using @xmath42 , see ( [ biascorr ] ) , so that@xmath43 applying the algorithm for @xmath44 , results in sequences of order statistics @xmath33 , least squares estimators @xmath45 , along with the scaled forward residuals @xmath46 atkinson and riani @xcite propose to use the minimum deletion residual @xmath47 instead of the forward residuals .",
    "thus , the deletion residual is based on the smallest residual with respect to @xmath48 among those observations that were not included in @xmath49 which in turn is based on @xmath50 , and the forward residual is the largest absolute residual in @xmath36 which is based on  @xmath48 .",
    "the plots of @xmath48 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 against @xmath7 are called forward plots , see atkinson and riani @xcite , pages  1213 .",
    "the primary objective of this paper is to derive the asymptotic distribution of these plots .",
    "when the method was proposed by hadi and simonoff @xcite , they also suggested scaling the residual by a leverage factor and replace the scaled residuals @xmath53 above by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the leverage factor .",
    "johansen and nielsen @xcite prove that such a leverage factor does not change the asymptotic distribution for the one - step huber - skip estimator , and the methods presented there can be used to prove a similar result for the forward search .",
    "another small sample correction would be to replace @xmath56 with @xmath57 in ( [ sigma^m ] ) , but we are mainly concerned with asymptotic properties in this paper .",
    "johansen and nielsen @xcite , theorems 5.15.3 , analysed a single step of the forward search applied in a location - scale setting .",
    "those results show that the one - step version of the scaled residuals @xmath58 has an asymptotic representation involving an empirical process and a term arising from the estimation error for the variance .",
    "the subsequent analysis shows how this result generalises to a fully iterated forward search .",
    "this section first gives the assumptions , then the results , and finally presents some simulations .",
