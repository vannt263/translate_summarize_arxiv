    "the omega background was first introduced in @xmath1 susy gauge theories to regularise the infinite volume of @xmath4 in the computation of instanton contributions to the partition function by localisation @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has also proven to be a formidable way to preserve integrability of these theories upon deformation .",
    "in fact , this background is characterised by two equivariant deformation parameters @xmath5 and @xmath0 associated to the breaking of the lorentz invariant four dimensional space into @xmath6 , but still the nekrasov instanton partition function exhibits an integrable structure in the form of covariance under the spherical hecke central ( shc ) algebra @xcite ( which is formally equivalent to a @xmath7 algebra ) . the presence of this algebra shed light on the conjecture by @xcite of a duality between these four dimensional theories and the family of toda conformal field theories in two dimensions .",
    "moreover , the shc algebra is closely related to a tensorial version of the integrable calogero - moser hamiltonian and led to the construction of one of the most basic objects of quantum integrable theories , namely a ( instanton ) @xmath8-matrix @xcite .    in the nekrasov - shatashvili ( ns )",
    "limit @xmath2 , the theory possesses only one ( non - zero ) equivarant parameter @xmath5 and , besides , its 2d underlying integrable structure is better understood @xcite .",
    "the latter defines , indeed , a quantisation of a hitchin system associated to the seiberg - witten curve ( see @xcite and references therein ) which can now be characterised by a quantum curve @xcite .",
    "and this curve is , actually , equivalent to a tq - relation upon a ( quantum ) change of variables @xcite , while the new integrable system is the bi - spectral dual of the previous one @xcite .",
    "of course , of great interest for integrable model theory is the tq - relation , which can also be obtained directly from the nekrasov partition function by extremising the sum over young diagrams @xcite , a technique that goes back to @xcite .",
    "moreover , another key feature of integrability has come out of the blue since the original paper @xcite in the form of a non - linear integral equation ( nlie ) in the complex plane @xcite resembling a thermodynamical bethe ansatz ( tba ) equation @xcite .",
    "subsequently , this equation was derived in full detail by @xcite upon using the mayer cluster expansion technique @xcite .    in the present manuscript",
    ", we go beyond this limit and present an explicit formula for the first @xmath0-correction to the prepotential",
    ". this result should pave the way to a better understanding of the full @xmath0-deformation and its meaning as quantum integrable system characterised by a tba / nlie .",
    "this should ultimately lead to a richer algebraic structure similar to the shc hopf algebra as we know how , along the other way around , the ns limit of the shc algebra can be obtained @xcite . for convenience , we focus on @xmath1 sym with a single @xmath9 gauge group and a number of fundamental flavours",
    ". however , we believe that our mathematical construction and results be easily generalisable to arbitrary quivers ( along the lines of @xcite ) .    in fact , with respect to the latter reference ( exploiting the methods of mayer cluster expansion ) we shall add an efficient field theory argument .",
    "the latter is firstly used to disentangle the long- and short - range interactions between instantons : this is performed in section @xmath10 .",
    "then , we treat the short - range interactions by the mayer cluster expansion technique in section @xmath11 and achieve formul ( [ short_1 ] ) and ( [ fshort ] ) concerning the ( short - range ) prepotential . eventually , the two arguments are combined in section @xmath12 to build up our proposal for the prepotential at the order @xmath13 . in the last section ,",
    "this proposal is checked in the simple case of pure @xmath14 sym up to the order @xmath15 .",
    "a more detailed computation involving only the combinatorics of the mayer expansion is to appear shortly @xcite .",
    "in the expression derived by n. nekrasov in @xcite , the gauge coupling expansion of the instanton partition function for @xmath1 @xmath9 sqcd takes the form of a series over coupled integrals @xmath16 where the @xmath17-background equivariant deformation parameters @xmath18 are supposed to have a positive imaginary part , @xmath19 is the dynamical scale and @xmath20 . in formula ( [ pf ] ) and",
    "then in the following , integrations are performed along a contour that surrounds the upper half - plane , including the real axis but excluding possible singularities at the complex infinity .",
    "the potential @xmath21 is a rational function that can be expressed as the ratio of matter and gauge polynomials , @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote respectively the number of flavors ( fundamental massive hypermultiplets ) and colors ( adjoint gauge multiplets ) .",
    "the coulomb branch vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) are assumed to be real but inside the integration contour , i.e. @xmath25 . the universal kernel for @xmath1 sym with a single gauge group ( @xmath26 quiver ) is @xmath27 since we consider nested integrals , we need a prescription for the poles at @xmath28 and @xmath29 : we assume that the variable @xmath30 is real , taking the poles at @xmath31 and @xmath32 , but not their counterparts at @xmath33 and @xmath34 . for other gauge groups ,",
    "the prescription is more subtle and has been discussed in @xcite .    in order to exploit quantum field theory methods ,",
    "we factorise the kernel into two pieces @xmath35 where the universal kernel @xmath36 contains singularities at @xmath37 that pinch the integration contour only in the ns limit @xmath38 .",
    "it can be interpreted as a strong short - range interaction responsible for the formation of bound states of instantons @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "the long - range interaction @xmath39 is free of such singularities and can be treated by standard mayer expansion methods @xcite .",

    "the ns prepotential is related under the agt correspondence to the semi - classical conformal block of liouville field theory .",
    "this conformal block can be obtained by solving in the classical limit @xmath201 the null vector decoupling equation ( nvde ) obeyed by a five - points correlator with a degenerate operator of level two inserted .",
    "this operation corresponds to insert a surface operator in the agt dual instanton partition function @xcite .",
    "the nvde is identified in @xcite with a schrdinger equation obtained in a quantised version of the sixth painlev equation @xcite .",
    "our result should be connected to the @xmath202 corrections to the wkb solution of this schrdinger problem .    still in the case of @xmath200 sym",
    ", it is possible to take the colliding limit of the potential @xmath21 in which the leading order prepotential compute the classical irregular conformal blocks @xcite .",
    "this quantity is related to the accessory parameter of a mathieu equation ( i.e. the energy in the schrdinger form ) obtained as the aforementioned classical limit of the nvde @xcite .",
    "the formula presented here allows the computation of the first semi - classical correction to the irregular conformal block .",
    "this correction could be related to a deformation of the mathieu equation .",
