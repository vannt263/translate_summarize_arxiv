    "in the lmc and smc , red giant variables follow at least five period - luminosity relations , originally named sequences a to e @xcite .",
    "sequence a , b and c are radial pulsation sequences and sequence d , which is parallel to sequences a , b and c but of longer period , is still of unknown physical origin @xcite .",
    "sequence e stars follow a loose period - luminosity relation between sequences c and d , but they extend to lower luminosities .",
    "sequence e stars are widely accepted to be binaries @xcite .",
    "the orbital periods of the sequence e red giants are typically 100600 days and the full light curve amplitudes are less than 0.6 mag in the macho red ( @xmath2 ) band .",
    "they lie on the first giant branch in the case of low - mass stars , or the equivalent pre - core helium burning giant phase of intermediate mass stars @xcite .",
    "some of the sequence e stars also extend to the agb @xcite . as a whole ,",
    "sequence e stars make up approximately 0.52% of the rgb and agb stars in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "sequence e variables show ellipsoidal light variations @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "the primary star has evolved to the red giant phase and substantially filled its roche lobe . because the orbital separation of the system is similar to the size of the red giant , the red giant is distorted from spherical symmetry to an ellipsoid or pear - like shape by tidal interactions with its unseen companion .",
    "it is the orbital rotation of this shape that gives rise to the ellipsoidal light variations .",
    "about 7% of sequence e variables show eclipses in addition to the ellipsoidal light variations @xcite .",
    "the first radial velocity curves of sequence e stars were presented in @xcite and from their observations , the mean full velocity amplitude is about 43 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "this is consistent with the amplitudes expected for close red giant binaries with roughly solar - mass components .",
    "the velocity variation of the ellipsoidal variable is regular , dominated by its orbital motion . for every single cycle of the velocity variation",
    "there are two cycles of light variation , the latter being caused by the change in apparent surface area .",
    "in past and ongoing radial velocity studies of sequence e stars in the lmc , we have obtained spectra for 110 systems . in none of these systems",
    "do we see the emission lines characteristic of symbiotic stars .",
    "this means that the companion is unlikely to be a white dwarf or neutron star .",
    "it is presumably a main - sequence star so that the red giant is usually the primary star in the binary system .",
    "as the roche lobe of the sequence e red variables is already substantially filled , further expansion of the red giant as it evolves is expected to soon cause roche lobe overflow . the binary system will suffer a common envelope ( ce ) event ( except in the rare case that the red giant has previously lost sufficient mass that mass transfer is stable ) . a ce event will lead to the ejection of the red giant envelope and the termination of rgb or agb evolution .",
    "if the two stellar cores do not merge in the ce event , a luminous compact close binary system will be left . in the case of a ce event occurring on the rgb",
    ", the compact system will be a low mass white dwarf binary ; while on the agb , the remnant stellar core will be the central star of a planetary nebula ( pn ) .",
    "if the two stellar cores do merge they should form a rapidly rotating red giant of the fk comae class @xcite .",
    "the fraction of the rapidly rotating red giants is about 2% @xcite , although many of these stars may be tidally locked binaries rather than single stars .",
    "the most common morphology of pne is nonspherical and there are several theories attempting to explain the underlying mechanisms responsible for the shaping . among all the mechanisms ,",
    "the binary hypothesis is most favoured @xcite and it has been confirmed by observations in some cases .",
    "in fact , the shape of pne with close binary central stars is definitely observed to be asymmetric .",
    "it has been suggested that binary interaction plays a major role in the formation and shaping of many @xcite , or even most pne @xcite .    at the present time , the actual fraction of pne with close binary central stars is not clear .",
    "the short periods of the known central stars of binary pne mean that these stars have been through a ce phase since the companion currently lies well within the radius of the precursor star when it was a red giant .",
    "it seems fairly clear that the brighter sequence e stars are indeed the immediate precursors of the known binary pne central stars . at lower luminosities , the low mass white dwarf binaries , which are produced from rgb binaries ( e.g.",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , should be descendants of sequence e stars .",
    "it is our aim to use the observed fraction of sequence e stars among all red giants to estimate the fraction of pne with close binary central stars .",
    "we also use the sequence e fraction and the overall population of rgb stars in the lmc to estimate the birthrate and population of all pne there , along with the birthrate of low mass white dwarf binaries .    in a study using macho light curves of stars in a central part of the lmc bar , @xcite found that @xmath00.5% of the red giants in the top one magnitude of the rgb were detected as sequence e variables in the @xmath2 band .",
    "similarly , @xcite and @xcite using ogle ii data found that 12% of red giants were detected as sequence e variables .",
    "these numbers provide the calibrating input for the fractions of close binary pne and low mass helium white dwarfs produced by ce events . simultaneously , with this calibration , we can also estimate the fraction of red giants that are in wider binaries which reach the agb tip without roche lobe filling , and the fraction of pne that are descended from single stars .",
    "the prediction of the evolutionary fate of binary and single red giants is made by a monte carlo simulation .",
    "one million red giant binary systems are generated using orbital element distributions derived from observations of stars in the solar vicinity .",
    "the evolutionary fate of these binary systems is then examined .",
    "single stars are added to the total stellar population in order to reproduce the observed fraction of sequence e stars on the red giant branch .",
    "details of the standard simulation model are described in section [ standard ] . besides the standard model , we adjust the inputs to see how dependent the results are on the model assumptions .",

    "the evolutionary tracks of show that the minimum mass of low - mass stars in the lmc that are currently on the first giant branch is about @xmath19 .",
    "stars with @xmath20 have not yet evolved to the rgb since such stars have a main sequence lifetime longer than the time since the first stars formed .",

    "stars with mass larger than this do not reach the high luminosities of the observed sequence e stars in the lmc until they enter the early - agb ( eagb ) . as the lmc star formation is assumed to cease 0.5 gyrs ago , the maximum mass for agb stars is @xmath22 . in the monte carlo simulation , we adjust ` @xmath13 ' so that @xmath23 , and draw the primary mass from the normalized @xmath16",

    "the mass ratio distribution follows a gaussian - type relation , with a peak at 0.23 .",
    "the reason we use the distribution from the solar vicinity ( as well as the orbital period distribution described below ) is that the mass ratio distribution is unknown observationally in the lmc .",
    "+ given that we now know both masses in the binary system , we can decide which component is ` currently ' being seen as the red giant .",
    "this is done by randomly assigning the primary or the secondary as the current red giant with probabilities that are proportional to the star formation rate at the time the system would have been born if the primary or secondary , respectively , was the current red giant . in the case",
    "where the secondary is the current red giant , the full evolution of the primary is followed before the evolution of the secondary is considered .",

    "many binary stars in the simulation reach luminosities on the agb where a superwind causes agb termination , just as happens for a single star .",
    "this termination is assumed to occur over a brief interval and it is treated by specifying an agb termination luminosity ( see section  [ term_lim ] ) .",

    "the orbital evolution resulting from mass loss and accretion is calculated using equation ( 20 ) in @xcite .",
    "when a red giant substantially fills its roche lobe , tides induced in the red giant by the orbiting companion cause the conversion of orbital angular momentum into spin angular momentum of the red giant .",
    "we treat this process using the equations in section 2.3.1 of @xcite .",
    "in particular , the rate of change of spin angular momentum is given by equations ( 26 ) and ( 35 ) of @xcite , with the spin angular momentum change being extracted from orbital angular momentum of the binary system .",

    ", the amplitude of the light variation depends on the fractional filling of the roche lobe by the red giant , the mass ratio and the orbital inclination .    rather than using an analytic approximation to the ellipsoidal light variations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we use the program nightfall to model the observed ellipsoidal light variations of partial - roche lobe filling systems as a function of binary parameters . in these models , the effective temperature of the red giant is set to 4000 k , as most of our sequence e stars are k or m type stars .",
    "a blackbody flux distribution is assumed .",
    "since the companions of the sequence e stars are expected to be mostly main sequence stars , the radius and luminosity of the secondary star are set to small values so they do not affect the light variation . as noted in section  [ generation ] , we assume zero eccentricity",

    "there are three possible outcomes of such ce events",
    "a ce event leads to the formation of a close binary consisting of a red giant core and a secondary star .",
    "in this case , evolution of the red giant core to high effective temperatures is too slow to lead to creation of a pn ( see the post - rgb evolution tracks of but note the comments at the beginning of section  [ stand_mod ] ; the cores of eagb stars also evolve slowly as they are burning he in a shell ) .",
    "we will generally call these stars post - rgb stars even though some of them come from the eagb .",
    "theoretical considerations suggest that the outcome of a ce event in a close binary on the rgb ( or eagb ) is likely to be a post - ce binary consisting of a low - mass he - core ( or co - core ) white dwarf and a basically unaltered low - mass secondary @xcite .",
    "we suggest that some population ii cepheids , uu herculis variables and rv tauri stars with luminosities below the rgb tip are also formed in this way .",
    "most , if not all , rv tauri stars are binary systems that have mid - infrared dust emission and circumbinary disks , as expected from terminating red giant evolution on the rgb or agb by roche lobe filling .",
    "observationally , some of the population ii cepheids , uu herculis variables and rv tauri stars in the lmc have luminosities below the rgb tip luminosity @xcite .",

    "some of the binary population ii cepheids , uu herculis variables and rv tauri stars with dust disks could be produced in this way .",
    "we use the well determined fractions of the sequence e stars on the top one magnitude of the rgb ( section [ macho_ogle ] , wood s 0.61% and soszyski s 1.33% ) to normalize our calculations . given our adopted imf , period distribution and mass ratio distributions , some binary stars will have parameters such that the roche lobe fills or nearly fills at these luminosities ( @xmath40 ) , and the star will exhibit detectable ellipsoidal light variations characteristic of sequence e stars over a luminosity sub - interval of one magnitude .",
    "the lifetime as a sequence e star , corresponding to this luminosity sub - interval , is calculated by using the evolutionary rate described in section [ mass_loss ] .",
    "some of the other binaries will have their evolution terminated by interaction before reaching @xmath120 and some will evolve through the full interval without showing any detectable light variations . in the latter case , the lifetime is also calculated using the evolutionary rate described in section [ mass_loss ] .",
    "we calculate and sum the sequence e lifetimes of all rgb and eagb stars in the interval @xmath121 and we also calculate and sum the total lifetimes of all red giants as they pass through this interval .",
    "the ratio of the summed sequence e lifetimes of those binaries showing detectable ellipsoidal variations to the total summed lifetimes of all binaries gives the apparent fraction of sequence e stars .",
    "this apparent fraction due to binaries alone is always greater than the observed fraction .",
    "therefore , after we have considered @xmath122 binary stars in the monte carlo simulation , we add single stars to the population of stars , assuming they evolve through the full interval @xmath40 , until the predicted and observed sequence e fractions match .",
    "note that we are implicitly assuming here that the ratio of binary to single stars in the lmc is a free parameter and that it can differ from the ratio estimated for stars in the solar vicinity .",
    "according to the percentage of solar - type stars that are single is @xmath033% while @xcite , who derive a period distribution quite similar to that of , estimate the percentage of single solar - type stars to be @xmath056% .",
    "we emphasize that our main purpose in this study is to use the observed sequence e star population , which has initial orbital periods of @xmath0100 - 600 days , to estimate the population of red giants whose evolution is affected by binary interactions .",
    "these interacting stars typically have initial orbital periods of @xmath1233000 days .",
    "the observed period distribution of binary stars is very broad with a peak at @xmath0@xmath124 days and the stars we are primarily concerned with occupy only a small part of the overall period distribution .",
    "our predictions related to red giant evolution should thus be relatively insensitive to the overall period distribution ( provided it is smooth ) .",
    "however , estimates of the numbers of stars with periods @xmath1253000 days , and the number of single stars , will depend more sensitively on the overall period distribution .",
    "in this section , we present the results for our standard model using both the wood and soszyski frequencies for sequence e stars .",
    "the models produce the relative birthrates of stars that terminate their agb or rgb evolution .",
    "the numbers in table  [ results_tab ] give these relative birthrates .    throughout this paper",
    "we make some assumptions .",
    "firstly , we assume that all stars that leave the agb produce a pn . secondly ,",
    "when we compare ratios of populations of different types of pne ( for example close binaries pne and all pne ) we assume that the pn lifetimes is independent of the agb termination process ( ce event or wind ) although this may not be the case ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "similar considerations apply for the post - rgb stars .",
    "it should be kept in mind that we are really comparing birth rates .",
    "an example of how evolution rates could be different for post - ce stars and single or non - interacting binaries is provided by the class of post - agb ( perhaps post - rgb ) star that consists of a binary system with a dusty circumbinary disk , an orbital period of a few hundred days or more , and a large eccentricity @xcite .",
    "these stars could result from agb or rgb termination by stable mass transfer .",
    "alternatively , their evolutionary path could be caused by the high eccentricity of their orbits .",
    "the disks around these stars may provide a reservoir of hydrogen that can be accreted back onto the high luminosity star to fuel nuclear burning for an extended period , at the same time keeping the hydrogen envelope thick enough to maintain a relatively low @xmath89 which is insufficient to excite a pn .    at the other extreme",
    "is the possibility that a common envelope event in a rgb star can remove enough of the hydrogen above the burning shell that the star comes out of the ce event with @xmath89 large enough to excite a pn almost immediately @xcite . in our modelling",
    ", we assume that this does not happen and that the evolution of post - rgb stars is so slow that the circumstellar shell has dispersed before @xmath89 reaches values high enough to produce a pn ( see section  [ outcome ] , item 3a ) .      with the standard inputs and the evolutionary scenarios described above , we examine which binary systems form close binary pne , intermediate period binary pne , wide binary pne , single binary pne , and post - rgb binaries . the predicted pne fractions of the standard model are listed in the first two lines of table [ results_tab ] . in the total population of planetary nebula nuclei ( pnne ) ,",
    "close binaries make up 9% or 7% , intermediate period binaries make up 27% or 23% , wide binaries make up 55% or 46% , and single stars make up 3% or 19% , using wood s ( 0.61% ) or soszyski s ( 1.33% ) frequency , respectively .",
    "the ratio of post - rgb star births to close binary pnne births is @xmath050% . of those binaries undergoing a ce event on the agb , we find @xmath01.4% suffer a merger while the remainder produce a close binary . due to the relatively higher binding energy of stars on the rgb ,",
    "the frequency of mergers happening on the rgb is much higher than that on the agb .",
    "below @xmath126 , essentially all red giants with a main sequence companion merge when roche lobe overflow occurs .",
    "however , if the companion is a white dwarf , a double degenerate binary can be produced down to low luminosities .",
    "our standard model predicts that merged stars , which are likely to be rapidly rotating red giants , would make up about 5% of the red giants on the rgb above @xmath126 .",
    "lower on the giant branch , the merged fraction will be less than 5% .",
    "@xcite estimate the observed fraction of rapidly rotating red giants to be @xmath02% .",
    "our results can be compared to the binary evolution models of @xcite .",
    "their models 4 and 11 have input parameters similar to our standard model except that our initial period distribution is different from theirs ( they assume a constant number of binaries per interval of @xmath127 , where @xmath35 is the binary separation ) . in our standard model",
    ", we find that about 8% of pnne are close binaries whereas @xcite predict that about 45% of pnne are close binaries ( see the column `` ce ejection ( agb ) '' in table 1 of @xcite and column `` binary pnne / ce '' in this paper ) .",
    "the reason for our higher fraction can be traced to the different initial period distributions .",
    "binary systems that undergo ce ejections on the agb have initial orbital periods of about 2301400 days or separations of about 230760 r@xmath53 ( assuming the binary component masses are @xmath01.5 m@xmath53 ) . all binary systems with initial periods ( or separations ) greater than these values",
    "will produce pne through wind mass loss , as will single stars .",
    "the number of binaries with initial periods ( or separations ) that lead to a ce event on the agb , relative to the number of all binaries plus single stars that produce pne , is roughly twice as large in our standard model as in models 4 and 11 of @xcite .",
    "this explains the higher fraction of close binary pnne produced in our standard model .",
    "( we note that our models 15 and 16 , described in section  [ non - standard ] , have similar period distributions to models 4 and 11 of @xcite .",
    "both sets of models predict that about 45% of pnne are close binaries indicating similar outcomes for similar input physics . )",
    "finally , we note that the fractions of close binary pnne given by @xcite are somewhat arbitrary since these fraction depends on the maximum binary separation allowed for their binary systems ( they adopt , without giving justification , a maximum separation of @xmath128 r@xmath53 ) .",
    "they also make the assumption that there are no single stars . in our models ,",
    "the fraction of stars that are single or in wide or intermediate period binaries is observationally constrained by the fraction of stars showing ellipsoidal variability on the rgb .",
    "we now examine observational estimates of the fraction of close binary pne .",
    "searches carried out by bond and collaborators for close binary central stars of pne using photometric variability techniques obtained a fraction of 1015% for close binary pne @xcite .",
    "however , the survey bias is not well understood since the pne samples were monitored over 30 years with many different observing campaigns @xcite .",
    "a new survey for close binary central stars by got a fraction of 1221% for close binary pne .",
    "this survey is more efficient and was carried out in a relatively uniform manner , by searching for periodic photometric variability of homogeneous pne samples .",
    "however , their 1221% is not a definitive fraction for close binary central stars .",
    "for example , the four close binary central stars phr 1744 - 3355 , phr 1801 - 2718 , phr 1804 - 2645 and phr 1804 - 2913 in the sample of 22 have been subsequently questioned and excluded by @xcite which would reduce their close binary fraction to 1016% . on the other hand , accounting for the effect of orbital inclination on the light curve amplitude , the derived close binary fraction could increase .",
    "our standard model prediction of @xmath079% for close binary pne , is lower than the fractions estimated from the observations mentioned above .",
    "however , our simulation is strongly constrained by the observed fractions of sequence e stars . in addition",
    ", our model reproduces the observed light amplitude , period and velocity amplitude distributions of sequence e stars as well as the fraction of low mass he white dwarfs in the total white dwarf population ( see section [ wd_mdist ] ) .",
    "this suggests that our estimated fraction of pne with close binary central stars is reliable .",

    "<S> sequence e variables are close binary red giants that show ellipsoidal light variations . </S>",
    "<S> they are likely the immediate precursors of planetary nebulae ( pne ) with close binary central , stars as well as other binary post - agb and binary post - rgb stars . </S>",
    "<S> we have made a monte carlo simulation to determine the fraction of red giant binaries that go through a common envelope ( ce ) event leading to the production of a close binary system or a merged star . </S>",
    "<S> the novel aspect of this simulation is that we use the observed frequency of sequence e binaries in the lmc to normalize our calculations . </S>",
    "<S> this normalization allows us to produce predictions that are relatively independent of model assumptions . in our standard model , and assuming that the relative numbers of pne of various types are proportional to their birthrates , we find that in the lmc today the fraction of pne with close binary central stars is 79% , the fraction of pne with intermediate period binary central stars having separations capable of influencing the nebula shape ( orbital periods less than 500 years ) is 2327% , the fraction of pne containing wide binaries that are unable to influence the nebula shape ( orbital period greater than 500 years ) is 4655% , the fraction of pne derived from single stars is 319% and 5 - 6% of pne are produced by previously merged stars . </S>",
    "<S> we also predict that the birthrate of post - rgb stars is @xmath04% of the total pn birthrate , equivalent to @xmath050% of the production rate of pne with close binary central stars . </S>",
    "<S> these post - rgb stars most likely appear initially as luminous low - mass helium white dwarf binaries . </S>",
    "<S> the average lifetime of sequence e ellipsoidal variability with amplitude more than 0.02 magnitudes is predicted to be @xmath00.95  myr . </S>",
    "<S> we use our model and the observed number of red giant stars in the top one magnitude of the rgb in the lmc to predict the number of pne in the lmc . </S>",
    "<S> we predict 548 pne in good agreement with the 541@xmath189 pne observed by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since most of these pne come from single or non - interacting binary stars in our model , this means that most such stars produce pne contrary to the `` binary hypothesis '' which suggests that binary interaction is required to produce a pn .    </S>",
