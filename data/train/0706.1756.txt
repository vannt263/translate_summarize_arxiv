    "@xcite , several new excited states and transitions have been reported .",

    "@xcite the authors proposed to consider the isotopes between @xmath7ru and @xmath8ru as belonging to a transition from the u(5 ) to the so(6 ) limit of the interacting boson model ( ibm )  @xcite .",
    "in geometrical terms this would be equivalent to a transition between a spherical vibrator  @xcite and a @xmath1-unstable rotor  @xcite .",
    "the authors of  @xcite used a schematic hamiltonian , which can describe the main features of the u(5 ) to so(6 ) transition in even - even ru isotopes . in their conclusion",
    "they viewed this simplified treatment only as a guideline .",
    "a more detailed approach is necessary for a comparison of the data with the model for each nucleus .",
    "even - even ru isotopes were studied in  @xcite , where the ibm-2 was used . in this variant of the model ,",
    "separate proton and neutron bosons are considered .",
    "the authors focussed their attention on mixed - symmetry states  @xcite .    more recently",
    "a search for a possible phase transition in these nuclei was carried out in  @xcite .",
    "again , a schematic hamiltonian was used to describe the u(5 ) to so(6 ) transition .",
    "the use of coherent states  @xcite allowed the authors to keep track of the dependence on deformation of the total energy surface .",
    "the authors came to the conclusion that a phase transition takes place at @xmath6ru , which can be considered as an example of the e(5 ) critical symmetry proposed by iachello  @xcite .",
    "other models have also been used for the calculation of excitation energies and transition strengths .",
    "the rotation - vibration model  @xcite and the generalized collective model  @xcite were applied to @xmath9ru .",
    "a microscopically based quadrupole bohr hamiltonian was applied to @xmath6ru  @xcite .",
    "recently excited states in @xmath10ru were populated in a @xmath11 fusion - fission reaction  @xcite .",
    "the bands above the backbending were interpreted with the cranked shell model .",
    "the main aim of this work is to describe the most important observables of the heavy @xmath0ru isotopes such as excitation energies , e2 branching ratios and the odd - even staggering in the quasi-@xmath1 bands by using the interacting boson model .",

    "if observed ) is closer to the @xmath21 state , and it looks like belonging to a @xmath22 multiplet , as predicted by the wilets - jean model  @xcite or the so(6 ) symmetry of the ibm .",
    "the energy ratios fit into the picture too .",
    "this is a good reason for trying to describe the even - even ru isotopes in the framework of the algebraic .",
    "the building blocks of the are @xmath23-bosons with an angular momentum 2 , and @xmath24-bosons , with an angular momentum 0 .",

    ", the @xmath23-boson seniority @xmath36 is again a good quantum number .",
    "the  standard \" hamiltonian contains only one- and two - body operators .",
    "the excitation spectrum of a single nucleus ( at fixed total boson number @xmath27 ) depends on a maximum of six free parameters in the hamiltonian .",
    "a less general hamiltonian which is suitable for the description of the transition between the u(5 ) and so(6 ) ds is  @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the quadrupole operator .",
