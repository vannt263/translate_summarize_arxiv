    "pluto was the first body to be discovered in the kuiper belt of icy planetesimals orbiting in the outer solar system .",
    "although now only the second - largest body known in the belt ( after eris ) , pluto is intensively studied , and is the primary target of the new horizons mission @xcite , with a spacecraft flyby scheduled in 2015 . in particular",
    ", pluto offers the rare opportunity to study a very cold planetary atmosphere which also evolves strongly with time , and may in fact be transient , settling and freezing out on the surface @xcite as pluto recedes from the sun in its highly elliptical orbit . as pluto s",
    "last perihelion was in 1989 , subsequent contraction of the atmosphere was expected , but in fact when observed by occultation of stars the atmospheric pressure and size had increased between 1988 and 2002 @xcite . around the same time , the surface ice had become redder , and also brighter around the northern pole as it came more into sunlight @xcite . many of these results were surprising , such as changes in albedo over as little as a year , and darkening of the southern regions , contrary to expectations if ices have been sublimating from here most recently .    the atmosphere and surface must be strongly coupled , since sublimation of ices supplies the atmosphere ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) , and so as the composition of the surface changes seasonally @xcite , the gas abundances should also evolve .",
    "atmospheric temperatures of around 100  k @xcite are much warmer than the surface at only 40 k @xcite .",
    "this requires a complex thermal balance controlled by the relative abundances of molecules that absorb radiation and re - emit in cooling lines , plus there is an overall influence of the level of sunlight , particularly in the ultra - violet @xcite .",
    "the atmosphere is also very fragile , with a solar - driven slow wind predicted to be removing it into space ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) .",
    "[ fig1 ]     such a cold diffuse atmosphere is difficult to study by remote observation , and most conclusions are presently model - based .",
    "the trace gas methane is the only one to have been confirmed spectroscopically @xcite .",
    "surface - ice spectroscopy shows frozen nitrogen dominates @xcite , with methane and carbon monoxide also present , plus possibly ethane @xcite and nitriles @xcite .",
    "n@xmath1 must dominate the atmosphere as it vaporizes readily and is by a factor of 50 the most abundant ice @xcite , but sublimated co is the strongest coolant @xcite and so should act as the thermostat .",
    "some evidence for co includes the brightest patch on pluto s surface , suggested to be co ice ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , and an extinction layer seen in atmospheric occultation , interpreted as droplets of n@xmath1 or co @xcite .",
    "prior searches for gaseous co have been made with ground - based telescopes .",
    "infrared absorption spectroscopy has recently constrained co : n@xmath1 to be @xmath20.5  % near the surface @xcite , an order of magnitude below an earlier limit @xcite .",
    "there is also a long history of millimetre - wavelength searches , looking for rotational transitions of co from the higher atmosphere @xcite . as the atmosphere is warmer than the surface , and extends beyond the planetary disc , emission lines",
    "are predicted .",
    "the major difficulty is that pluto is small and distant , subtending less than a percent of the beam solid angle , even for telescopes of 10 - 30 m class .",
    "an upper limit was first obtained using the haystack 37 m in 1993 , for the co j=1 - 0 transition rotational line at 2.6 mm wavelength @xcite .",
    "this limit was improved by the equivalent of eight - fold in 2000 , with the iram 30 m telescope @xcite , and this group also searched for the j=2 - 1 transition at 1.3  mm with better sensitivity .",
    "a tentative positive signal was seen , with the brightest spectral channel observed at 28 mk in main - beam brightness temperature , versus 1@xmath3 noise of 10 mk per 0.1  km / s spectral channel .",
    "however , the observation was severely affected by a strong line from a background galactic cloud , coming as close as 0.5 km / s to potential pluto emission @xcite .",
    "the 2000 data suffered from an unfortunate coincidence in sky position with an uncatalogued galactic source , but pluto s orbit as seen from the earth has brought it closer to the galactic plane over the last couple of years .",
    "here we present results from the 15 m james clerk maxwell telescope , making a new search for the j=2 - 1 line , at epochs chosen to minimise galactic contamination behind pluto .",
    "the search was motivated by time availability at an excellent millimetre - site , and the opportunity to examine the evolution of pluto s atmosphere in the exciting run - up period to the arrival of new horizons @xcite .",
    "we report the confirmation of atmospheric co ( after two decades of searches ) , making it only the second gas - phase species to be detected , after methane @xcite .",
    "[ fig2 ]      [ fig3 ]     we used the jcmt at 4000 m altitude on mauna kea , hawaii , observing over 3 nights in august 2009 and 8 nights in april to may 2010 .",
    "conditions were good to average for the site , with zenith sky opacity at 1.3  mm typically around 0.1 .",
    "the setup used the acsis spectrometer @xcite together with the a3 receiver @xcite ( the instrument described was subsequently rebuilt by the herzberg institute of astrophysics with a 1.3  mm - band mixer ) .",
    "total on - source integration times were 12 and 19 hours in 2009 and 2010 respectively , with individual observations lasting approximately 20 minutes .",
    "the observing mode was frequency - switching , with a throw of 35.5 km / s within the passband .",
    "the telescope tracked pluto s sky position but not its velocity , so spectra were shifted in software to the dwarf planet s reference frame .",
    "the spectrometer channel spacing was set to 0.04  km / s and there are systematics of around @xmath40.025  km / s for velocity - drifts of pluto within each observation that have not been corrected .",
    "data are shown on the main - beam antenna temperature brightness scale , with a beam efficiency of 0.75 at 230.538 ghz frequency .    for each night of data ,",
    "the shifted spectra were co - added , and then the appropriate positive and negative frequency - switched features were averaged .",
    "the region of the net positive line was blanked and replaced with a linear interpolation of surrounding channels . a running average over 12 channels",
    "was then generated from this and subtracted from the pre - blanked spectrum as a baseline .",
    "the 11 nightly spectra made in this way were finally combined , weighted by 1/noise@xmath5 factors to take into account their different conditions and observing durations .",
    "rejected data include two earlier nights using a smaller frequency - switch , and two later nights when pluto had approached within 1.5@xmath6 of the galactic plane .",
    "these spectra show ripples and complex baselines , degrading the final line profile .",
    "the weight of these rejected data represent only 15  % of the total observations made .",
    "the observations were planned to maximise the height of pluto from the galactic plane , which varies as seen from the earth , to minimise contamination problems .",
    "galactic latitude in 2009 was + 2.2@xmath6 , and in 2010 was -2.0@xmath6 to -1.7@xmath6 , with longitudes of @xmath7 . using two periods",
    "well spaced around the year ( aug and apr / may ) also caused large changes in pluto s velocity relative to the telescope , from + 26 km / s in 2009 to -27 to -19 km / s in 2010 .",
    "thus any narrow line seen persistently at pluto s velocity in the co - added data can only be from the planetary atmosphere , as any galactic background emission is different every night .",
    "galactic lines were seen around pluto s velocity in the spring data , but were much broader than the pluto line .",
    "figure  1 shows the co - added pluto spectrum from 2009/10 , in the dwarf planet s rest - frame .",
    "a clear line is seen at zero velocity , with 6.5@xmath3 confidence in the integrated antenna temperature .",
    "there are no other significant narrow features ; the next brightest ( at -5 km / s ) , is at only 2.7@xmath3 over three spectral channels , and was traced to a signal from a pair only of the 11 observing nights .",
    "the broad features are residuals from the running - average subtraction process , arising from broad lines of galactic clouds from different nights . a detail spectrum",
    "( figure  2 ) shows the very flat baseline achieved near pluto s velocity , while a test made by blanking a broader region ( 20 channels instead of 12 ) showed a change in integrated brightness of only around 10  % .",
    "this argues for a robust signal measurement of the narrow line seen , and also implies that broad line wings are faint .",
    "the co line from pluto was independently detected in both the 2009 and 2010 epochs , at levels of 3.9@xmath3 and 5.4@xmath3 respectively , and with the same integrated brightness within the errors ( figure  2 , right panel ) .",
    "the antenna temperatures are calibrated to about 20  % , based on rms scatter of the line - peak signal of spectral standards taken every night on the nearby source oh17.7 - 2 .",
    "also , inclusion of the two nights of early data taken with a smaller frequency - switch was found to reduce the final integrated line intensity by @xmath8  % .",
    "the brightness measurements could be affected by broad structure in the baseline , and figure  3 demonstrates the spectrum obtained if the data are co - added without baselining .",
    "the curvature due to galactic residuals makes it difficult to establish the nature of faint line wings .",
    "the integrated antenna temperature of co j=2 - 1 over 8 spectral channels ( 0.32 km / s ) is 6.3@xmath41.0 mk km / s on a main - beam brightness temperature scale .",
    "the mean @xmath9 is 20  mk , and the 1@xmath3 noise per 0.04  km / s spectral channel is 8.6 mk ( twice as deep as @xcite for a common spectral resolution ) .",
    "the full - width at half - maximum intensity is approximately 0.28  km / s .",
    "the velocity centroid is @xmath10  km / s , including errors from comparing adjacent half - line intensities of 0.03  km / s and systematics of the 0.04  km / s channel spacing and @xmath11  km / s velocity drifts within scans .",
    "hence , the centroid velocity may be marginally positively offset from pluto .",
    "figure  2 also shows the co j=2 - 1 spectrum obtained in 2000 by @xcite .",
    "their @xmath9 values have been scaled downwards by a factor of four , to account for the greater beam - dilution for a compact source with the jcmt 15 m versus the iram 30 m telescope . on this ` jcmt - equivalent ' scale , the 2000 spectrum has a 3@xmath3 upper limit of 7.5 mk in each 0.10 km / s channel , and the brightest channel near zero velocity is 7  mk .",
    "weak positive signals were seen in line wings , and the integrated signal over @xmath12  km / s was 5.9 mk km / s , at signal - to - noise ratio of 4.5 .",
    "the integrated intensity appears similar in 2000 and 2009/10 , but the earlier spectrum has a greater contribution from possible line wings ( figure  2 )",
    ". a voigt - profile fit to the new spectrum suggests broad wings now contribute @xmath13  % .",
    "figure  2 shows that the line - centre emission in 2009/2010 significantly exceeds that in the observation from april 2000 @xcite . in the brightest 0.1 km / s channel ,",
    "the signal was @xmath14  mk , compared to @xmath15  mk now when averaged over the same region from the jcmt spectrum .",
    "thus the ratio is at least 22/10.5 from the @xmath16 bounds , implying the line - centre intensity has more than doubled over a decade .",
    "the core of the line now seen is narrower than previously predicted in models @xcite .",
    "model line profiles as plotted by @xcite are over twice as wide as observed , with full - width half - maxima of approximately 0.7  km / s .",
    "these models had atmospheric temperatures of 80 - 106 k , but our measured line width of 0.28 km / s implies that thermalised co can not be warmer than @xmath17  k. this estimate includes only thermal broadening , and so the gas could be even cooler if there is another source of velocity dispersion .",
    "@xcite find evidence for large - scale atmospheric waves , but with horizontal wind speeds of under 3  m / s , while upwards sublimation flows should be at only a few cm / s @xcite .",
    "the latter would also be in the contrary sense to the tentative red - shift noted above , since upwelling would produce a blue - shift from the near - side of the atmosphere that is preferentially observed .",
    "the marked increase in co line - peak brightness could be due to recent sublimation of surface ice  for example , the largest bright patch seen on pluto s surface is attributed to carbon monoxide frost @xcite . while this is a long - term feature in albedo maps , it could be a rich source of sublimating co. alternatively , a large expansion in isobar heights was detected between 1988 and 2002 @xcite , and such increases in atmospheric pressure could raise the effective emitting area for trace molecules .",
    "however , these occultation data only detect the atmosphere up to around 135  km ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) , so effects at higher altitudes are uncertain .",
    "regarding timescales , marked surface changes have occurred over intervals as short as a year @xcite , while vertical sublimation speeds @xcite imply a molecule could rise thousands of kilometres within a decade .",
    "hence it is reasonable that temporal changes in gas densities and/or abundances as surface ices sublimate could result in the co lines being quite different over observations a decade apart ( figure  2 ) .",
    "finding cold co points to gas at very large heights  for example temperatures as low as 50  k have been predicted for about 4500 km above the centre of pluto @xcite .",
    "this is under solar minimum conditions , as actually present in 2009/10 .",
    "if the top of the co layer is at 4500  km , then the atmosphere would subtend a diameter of 0.4 arcsec , as it was seen in 2009/10 with pluto at 31  au from the earth . from this , in the simplest approximation of a filled opaque shell of co molecules thermalised at 50 k , the beam - filling factor would be @xmath18 , giving an expected line brightness of 18  mk .",
    "this is in good agreement with our mean @xmath9 of 20  mk .",
    "lower atmospheric layers should be warmer and so add line brightness , but as an example , gas twice as hot ( 100  k ) is predicted to lie below 2000  km @xcite , and thus be five times more beam - diluted .",
    "exact calculations for the co line profile require radiative transfer calculations and an atmospheric model , beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "however , some estimates can be made for the heights of the emitting layers .",
    "the density profile should decline approximately as a power - law @xcite , if co has a constant mixing ratio with n@xmath1 .",
    "then the height below which the co emission becomes opaque can be estimated , or more strictly , the height of the tangent where the column of co molecules excited to the j=2 level produces @xmath19 , for opacity @xmath20 of unity and @xmath21 equal to the line fwhm of 0.28 km / s . in an isothermal 50  k approximation ,",
    "this height is 2750  km for a power - law density profile approximating that at solar maximum @xcite , and 2250  km for a solar minimum profile .",
    "the respective heights which contribute opacity of 0.01 are about 4600 and 3200  km .",
    "these values are for co : n@xmath1 of 0.005 , following @xcite and at an upper limit observed in july 2009 @xcite .",
    "if contributions to the co signal come from as high up as 4500  km , as estimated above from beam - filling arguments , then it appears that atmospheric densities must be at the high end of the models , or upper - level co must be more abundant than assumed . also , in the models high densities are associated with warmer temperatures than infered here  this anomaly may be related to heating from ch@xmath22 molecules absorbing solar uv , noting that recent estimates of the methane mixing ratio @xcite are up to @xmath23 times lower than assumed by @xcite .    the co upper boundary estimated to be at about 4500  km above the centre of pluto corresponds to @xmath24 radii , for @xmath25  km @xcite .",
    "this is a reasonable upper bound , given that above @xmath26  3 - 5 r@xmath27 , the gas should become so diffuse that is is collisionless @xcite , and thus the co j=2 level will not be populated .",
    "also , interaction with the solar wind will cause ionised gas ( and any swept - up neutrals ) to flow away into space , above @xmath28 r@xmath27 in the simulations of @xcite .",
    "the co layer estimated to extend out to @xmath24 r@xmath27 is thus inside this flow zone and can be expected to be stable .",
    "@xcite models a slower hydrodynamic outflow inside this region , but predicted speeds only exceed our 0.04  km / s velocity resolution above 4500  km , so effects on the spectrum would be negligible .",
    "it is however possible that the marginal co line red - shift , if real , could indicate a flow forming into a comet - like tail directed away from the sun .",
    "co gas should be chemically stable even at large altitudes , and at low densities , cloud models imply that it will stay in the gas phase .",
    "co ice could only form if seed particles existed  akin to noctilucent clouds on earth , where highly supersaturated water can condense out on rare solid particles , such as meteoritic dust raining in from space .",
    "such interplanetary dust is however sparse out in the kuiper belt @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed cloud decks lower down in pluto s atmosphere , with droplets of co or n@xmath1 that could explain an extinction layer @xcite . however , heterogeneous nucleation ( i.e. chemical reactions on a surface leading to increase of the droplet volume ) is only efficient inside a limited temperature interval , and it yields no droplets above heights of @xmath2930 km in these pluto models @xcite .",
    "since surface changes @xcite and the gaseous methane abundance @xcite are seen to be temporally variable , time - dependent models will be needed to balance the effects of heating , cooling , sublimation and solar irradiation .",
    "further co line monitoring is underway , and n@xmath1 gas can be detected for the first time with ultraviolet spectroscopy @xcite by the alice spectrograph on new horizons @xcite .",
    "hence atmospheric models can be tested from data taken before and during the 2015 flyby .",
    "carbon monoxide is confirmed in the atmosphere of pluto , and gives the first detection of high - altitude gas .",
    "there have been large temporal changes in the co line profile over the last decade , in parallel to major alterations of the surface ices .",
    "pluto s rapidly changing and fragile atmosphere could provide an interesting test - bed for models of global climates .",
    "this work was supported by the scottish universities physics alliance .",
    "the data were obtained under programme m09bu12 at the jcmt , with invaluable assistance from i. coulson and j. hoge .",
    "the james clerk maxwell telescope is operated by the joint astronomy centre on behalf of the science and technology facilities council of the united kingdom , the netherlands organisation for scientific research , and the national research council of canada .",
