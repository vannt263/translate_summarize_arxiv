    "the galactic center source sagittarius  a * ( sgr  a * ) provides the best case for high - resolution , detailed observations of the accretion and outflow region surrounding the event horizon of a black hole .",
    "there are several compelling reasons to observe sgr  a * with very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) at ( sub)millimeter wavelengths .",
    "the spectrum of sgr  a * peaks in the millimeter ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "interstellar scattering , which varies as the wavelength @xmath3 , becomes less than the fringe spacing of the longest baseline available to vlbi in the millimeter - wavelength regime .",
    "indeed , vlbi on the longest baselines available at 345  ghz probes scales of twice the schwarzschild radius ( @xmath4 ) for a @xmath1  m@xmath2 black hole . from previous observations at 230  ghz , it is known that there are structures on scales smaller than a few @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "such high angular resolution , presently unattainable by any other method ( including facility instruments such as the very long baseline array ) , is necessary to match the expected spatial scales of the emitting plasma in the innermost regions surrounding the black hole and will be required to unambiguously determine the inflow / outflow morphology and permit tests of general relativity .",
    "this sensitivity to small spatial scales also makes millimeter polarimetric vlbi possible . although the linear polarization fraction of sgr  a * integrated over the entire source is only a few percent ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the fractional polarization on small angular scales is likely much larger . in general ,",
    "relativistic accretion flow models predict that the electric vector polarization angle ( evpa ) will vary along the circumference of the accretion disk @xcite , indicating that single - dish observations and connected - element interferometers probably underestimate linear polarization fractions due to beam depolarization .",
    "polarized synchrotron radiation coming from sgr  a * was detected by @xcite at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "multiple observations since then have demonstrated that the polarized emission is variable on timescales from hours to many days @xcite . in one case ,",
    "the timescale of variability and the trace of polarization in the stokes @xmath5 plane of the millimeter - wavelength emission are suggestive of the detection of an orbit of a polarized blob of material @xcite .",
    "near infrared observations by @xcite are also consistent with a hot spot origin for periodic variability .",
    "it is possible that connected - element interferometry may suffice to demonstrate polarization periodicity , but millimeter - wavelength vlbi , which effectively acts as a spatial filter on scales of a few to a few hundred @xmath4 , can be more sensitive to changing polarization structures .",
    "initial millimeter vlbi observations of sgr  a * will necessarily utilize non - imaging analysis techniques , for reasons outlined in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth paper  i ) .",
    "one way to do this is to analyze so - called interferometric `` closure quantities , '' which are relatively immune to calibration errors @xcite . in paper",
    "i , we considered prospects for detecting the periodicity signature of a hot spot orbiting the black hole in sgr  a * via closure quantities in total - intensity millimeter - wavelength vlbi . in the single polarization case , it is necessary to construct closure quantities from at least three or four antennas in order to produce robust observables , since the timescales of atmospheric coherence and frequency standard stability do not permit standard nodding calibration techniques .",
    "closure quantities can be used in full - polarization observations as well , but it is also possible to construct robust observables on a baseline of two antennas by taking visibility ratios between different correlation products . in this work , we extend our techniques to explore polarimetric signatures of a variable source structure in sgr  a * , with emphasis on ratios of baseline visibilities .",
    "we employ the same models discussed in paper  i to describe the flaring emission of sgr  a * , and shall only briefly review these here , directing the reader to paper  i , and references therein , for more detail .",
    "these models consist of an orbiting hot spot , modelled by a gaussian over - density of power - law electrons , embedded in a radiatively inefficient accretion flow , containing both thermal and non - thermal electron populations .",
    "the primary emission mechanism for both components is synchrotron .",
    "we model the emission from the thermal and nonthermal electrons using the emissivities described in @xcite and @xcite , respectively , appropriately modified to account for relativistic effects ( see @xcite for a more complete description of polarized general relativistic radiative transfer ) . since we necessarily are performing the fully polarized radiative transfer , for the thermal electrons we employ the polarization fraction derived in @xcite . in doing",
    "so we have implicitly assumed that the emission due to the thermal electrons is locally isotropic , which , while generally not the case in the presence of ordered magnetic fields , is unlikely to modify our results significantly .",
    "for both electron populations the absorption coefficients are determined directly via kirchoff s law .",
    "as described in paper i , the assumed magnetic field geometry was toroidal , consistent with simulations and analytical expectations for magnetic fields in accretion disks , though other field configurations are possible ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "while the overall flux of our models is relatively insensitive to the magnetic field geometry , the polarization is dependent on it .",
    "however , polarization light curves and maps with considerably different magnetic field geometries ( e.g. , poloidal ) are qualitatively similar , showing large swings in polarization angle and patches of nearly uniform polarization in the images .",
    "generally , synchrotron emission has both linearly and circularly polarized components .",
    "however , the circular polarization fraction is suppressed by an additional factor of the electron lorentz factor . for the electrons producing the millimeter emission , this corresponds to a reduction by a factor of @xmath6@xmath7 in stokes @xmath8 in comparison to stokes @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this is consistent with observations by @xcite , who obtain an upper limit of @xmath11 circular polarization at 340  ghz .",
    "therefore , we explicitly omitted the circular polarization terms in the computation of flaring polarization .",
    "in addition , we have neglected the potentially modest intrinsic faraday rotation . within @xmath12@xmath13",
    "the accreting electrons are expected to be substantially relativistic , and thus not contribute significantly to the rotation measure within the millimeter - emitting region .",
    "this is consistent with the lack of observed faraday depolarization at these wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which itself implies the absence of significant in situ faraday rotation .",
    "similarly , beam depolarization caused by variations within an external faraday screen on angular scales comparable to that of the emission region are empirically excluded .",
    "this leaves the possibility of a smoothly varying external faraday screen , which manifests itself in the vlbi data as an additional phase difference between right and left circularly polarized visibilities , but does not affect our analysis otherwise .",
    "model images are created in each of the stokes parameters @xmath14 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "six models differing in hot spot orbital period , black hole spin , and accretion disk inclination and major - axis orientation are produced at 230 and 345  ghz , as in paper  i. model properties are summarized in table  [ tab - models ] .",
    "source - integrated linear polarization fractions range from 0.8 to 26% for models including both a disk and a hot spot , depending on the model and hot spot orbital phase , with typical integrated quiescent polarization fractions ( of the disk alone ) of 10 to 15% . integrated evpa variation over the course of the hot spot orbit ranges from 4 to 57 , depending on the model .",
    "the integrated polarization fractions and evpa variations as well as the polarization traces in the stokes @xmath5 plane ( fig .  [ fig - qu ] ) are all broadly consistent with the range of variability seen in the submillimeter array ( sma ) observations reported by @xcite",
    ". the local linear polarization fraction can be much higher , exceeding 70% in some parts of the accretion disk .",
    "simulated array data are produced by the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) task uvcon for each of the stokes parameters .",
    "the array is taken to consist of up to seven stations : the caltech submillimeter observatory , james clerk maxwell telescope , and six sma telescopes phased together into a single station ( hawaii ) ; the arizona radio observatory submillimeter telescope ( smt ) ; a phased array consisting of eight telescopes in the combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) ; the large millimeter telescope ( lmt ) ; the 30 m institut de radioastronomie millimtrique dish at pico veleta ( pv ) ; the plateau de bure interferometer phased together as a single station ( pdb ) ; and a site in chile , either a single 10 or 12 m class telescope ( chile 1 ) or a phased array of 10 dishes of the atacama large millimeter array ( chile 10 ) .",

    "these phase differences also enter into closure phases of cross - hand correlations as @xmath41 .",
    "fortunately , the right - left phase differences vary slowly with time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since the atmospheric transmission is not significantly birefringent at millimeter wavelengths and both polarizations are usually tied to the same local oscillator .",
    "we will henceforth assume that the @xmath42 terms can be properly calibrated ( for instance by observations of an unpolarized calibrator source ) , although proper calibration may not be strictly necessary for periodicity detection , since the expected timescale of variation of source structure is significantly faster than the timescale of variation of @xmath42 .",

    "even absent any complex gain calibration , it is probable that the contamination of the time series of cross - to - parallel amplitude ratios and ( especially ) phase differences by changes in @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively will also be seen in the @xmath46 amplitude ratio and @xmath48 phase difference .",
    "thus , large deviations seen in the cross - to - parallel quantities but not in the parallel - to - parallel quantities will likely be due to source structure differences , not gain miscalibration .",

    "however , it is unknown how large the @xmath38-terms will be for potential vlbi arrays at @xmath50 and @xmath51  mm , as many of the critical pieces of hardware ( including feeds , phased - array processors , and even the antennas themselves ) do not yet exist for some of the elements of such arrays . in any case",
    ", contributions from the @xmath38-terms may be comparable to or larger than contributions from the source polarization , at least on the shorter baselines .",

    "linear polarization fractions derived from single - dish and connected - element millimeter observations of sgr  a * are likely underestimates of the linear polarization fractions that will be seen with vlbi , since partial depolarization from spatially separated orthogonal polarization modes may occur when observed with insufficient angular resolution to separate them . that is , the small - scale structure that will be seen by vlbi is likely to have a larger polarization fraction than that observed so far with connected - element interferometery .",
    "calibration of the electric vector polarization angle ( evpa ) may be difficult , at least in initial observations , due to the lack of known millimeter - wavelength polarization calibration sources ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "evpa calibration will eventually be important for understanding the mechanism of linear polarization generation in sgr  a * , assuming that the linear polarization can be unambiguously corrected for faraday rotation .",
    "however , the ability of cross - hand correlation data to detect _ changes _ in the evpa is unaffected by absolute evpa calibration .    in the low signal - to - noise ( snr ) regime",
    ", the ratio of visibility amplitudes can be a biased quantity .",
    "visibility amplitudes are non - negative by definition , and the complex addition of a large noise vector to a small signal vector in the visibility plane will bias the visibility amplitude to higher values .",
    "nevertheless , even biased visibility amplitudes may be of some utility in detecting changing polarization structure . since the complex phase of noise is uniform random , phase differences are unbiased quantities .",
    "while lower - resolution observations of sgr  a * find polarization of less than 10% , the effective fractional polarization on smaller scales can be much larger .",

    "that would be produced by a disk and persistent , unchanging orbiting hot spot with parameters as given in model  a at 230  ghz .",

    "all of our models produce much higher polarization fractions on small angular scales than at large angular scales , and all models except for model  f at 345  ghz produce a substantial set of cross - to - parallel visibility amplitude ratios in excess of unity on angular scales of 4080  @xmath55as and smaller .",

    "these effects are much more pronounced on the short baselines , especially pv - pdb and smt - carma , because the fractional source polarization on large scales is small ( and thus @xmath69 ) . in most cases , the cross - to - parallel amplitude ratios and phase differences behave similarly whether instrumental polarization calibration is included or not simply by virtue of the fact that the polarized intensity is a large fraction of the total intensity .",
    "deviations in the cross - to - parallel phase difference response appear qualitatively large when the cross - hand amplitudes are near zero because small offsets from the source visibility , represented as a vector in the complex plane , can produce large changes in the angle ( i.e. , phase ) of the visibility .",

    "[ fig - acfs ] ) , but the lack of contrast is not so severe as in the total - intensity case ( cf .",
    "paper i ) due to the sensitivity of short - baseline cross - to - parallel phase differences to the source - integrated evpa .",
    "an array consisting of hawaii , smt , and carma is sufficient to confidently detect periodicity at a total bit rate of 2  gbits@xmath58 ( i.e. , 0.25  ghz bandwidth per polarization ) over 4.5 orbits of data for models  a - e .",
    "this contrasts with the total intensity case , in which a substantially higher bit rate is required on the same array , depending on the model ( paper i ) .",
    "the key point is that the cross - to - parallel visibility ratios on the short baselines trace the overall source polarization fraction and evpa , which are readily apparent even at the much coarser angular resolution afforded by connected - element interferometry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "long baselines are thus not strictly necessary to detect periodic polarimetric structural changes , although they will be important for modelling the small - scale polarimetric structure of the sgr  a*. in contrast , significantly higher bit rates and 4-element arrays are usually required to detect periodic source structure changes in total intensity ( paper i ) .",
    "long - period models ( e.g. , model  f ) are problematic for millimeter vlbi periodicity detection because it may not be possible to detect more than two full periods during the window of mutual visibility between most of the telescopes in a potential vlbi array .",
    "as with the total intensity case ( paper  i ) , the most promising approach for millimeter vlbi is to observe with an array of four or five telescopes , since large changes in cross - to - parallel phase differences and visibility amplitude ratios tend to be episodic across most or all baselines . the lmt is usefully placed because it provides a long window of mutual visibility to chile and the us telescopes as well as a small time overlap with pv , thus enabling a large continuous time range over which sgr  a * is observed .",
    "assuming that the flare source can survive for several orbital periods , connected - element interferometry may suffice to demonstrate periodicity .",
    "sgr  a * is above 10  elevation for approximately 9  hr from hawaii and 12  hr from chile .",
    "vlbi polarimetry has several key advantages over single - dish and connected - element interferometry for understanding the polarization properties of sgr  a*. first , even the shortest baselines likely to be included in the array will filter out surrounding emission .",
    "reliable single - dish extraction of polarization information requires subtracting the contribution from the surrounding dust , which can dominate the total polarized flux at 345  ghz and is significant even at 230  ghz @xcite .",
    "contamination by surrounding emission is much less severe for sma measurements , where the synthesized beamsize is on the order of an arcsecond , depending on configuration ( for instance , @xmath79 in the observations of * ? ? ?",
    "vlbi will do much better still , with the shortest baselines resolving out most of the emission on scales larger than @xmath80  mas ( @xmath81 ) , effectively restricting sensitivity to the inner accretion disk and/or outflow region .",
    "second , the resolution provided by millimeter vlbi will greatly reduce depolarization due to blending of emission from regions with different linear polarization directions",
    ". models of the accretion flow predict that linear polarization position angles and faraday rotation will be nonuniform throughout the source @xcite . for this reason , ratios of cross - hand to parallel - hand visibilities ( which are the visibility analogues of linear polarization fractions ) can greatly exceed the total linear polarization fraction integrated over the source ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig - uvplt ] and table  [ tab - models ] ) .",
    "third , vlbi polarimetry has the potential to identify whether changes in detected polarization are due to intrinsic source variability or changes in the rotation measure at larger distances .",
    "the former would be expected to be variable on relatively short timescales ( minutes to tens of minutes ) , consistent with the orbital period of emission at a few gravitational radii .",
    "the latter would be expected to vary more slowly and affect only the polarized emission , not the total intensity .",
    "a cross - correlation between polarized and total - intensity data may allow the two effects to be disentangled .",
    "linear polarization at millimeter wavelengths can be used to estimate the accretion rate of sgr  a * ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at frequencies below @xmath82",
    "ghz , no linear polarization is detected due to faraday depolarization in the accretion region @xcite .",
    "linear polarization is detected toward sgr  a * at higher frequencies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. , ) , where the effects of faraday rotation are smaller .",
    "ultimately , accretion rates are constrained by the lack of linear polarization at long wavelengths and its existence at short wavelengths .",
    "measurements of the faraday rotation exist , although it is unclear whether changes in detected polarization angles are due to changing source polarization structure or a variable rotation measure @xcite .",
    "longer term , imaging may be possible if all seven millimeter telescope sites heretofore considered ( and possibly others as well ) are used together as a global vlbi array ( e.g. , an event horizon telescope ; * ? ? ?",
    "imaging the quiescent polarization structure of sgr  a * may allow the characteristics of the source emission region to be distinguished from those of the region producing faraday rotation ( which may overlap or be identical with the emission region ) .",
    "contemporaneous millimeter vlbi observations at two different frequencies would allow separate maps of the intrinsic polarization structure and the rotation measure to be produced .",
    "it may also then be possible to place strong constraints on the density ( @xmath83 ) and magnetic fields ( @xmath84 ) in sgr  a*. briefly , the rotation measure is related to @xmath85 , while the total intensity is proportional to @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the optically thin spectral index @xcite . obtaining these results will require the ability to fully calibrate the data for instrumental polarization terms and the absolute evpa .",
    "it may also require higher image fidelity than a seven - telescope vlbi array can provide @xcite .",
    "there are possibilities for extending a millimeter vlbi array beyond these seven sites by adding other existing ( e.g. , the south pole telescope ) or new telescopes @xcite , but full consideration of the scientific impact of potential future arrays is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the inclusion of a screen of constant faraday rotation alters the phases of the cross - hand terms ( and therefore the cross - to - parallel phase differences ) but does not materially affect the detectability of changing polarization structure .",
    "the mean rotation measure of sgr  a * averaged over multiple epochs is @xmath88  radm@xmath89 @xcite , which corresponds to a rotation of polarization vectors by @xmath90 at 230  ghz and @xmath91 at 345  ghz .",
    "persistent gradients of rotation measure across the source are virtually indistinguishable from intrinsic polarization structure in the case of a steady - state source , but it is possible that the source structure and rotation measure change on different timescales , which would allow the two effects to be disentangled @xcite .",
    "comparison of changes in the polarization data with total intensity data ( obtained from the parallel - hand correlations ) and total polarization fraction ( obtained from simultaneous connected - element interferometric data if available , else inferred from the shortest vlbi baselines ) may be useful for identifying whether observed polarization angle changes are due to a variable rotation measure @xcite .",
    "the physical mechanism that produces flares in total intensity and polarization changes is poorly understood .",
    "connected - element interferometry at millimeter wavelengths has not been conclusive as to whether orbiting hot spots are the underlying mechanism that produces flares in sgr  a * ( cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) , or even as to whether multiple mechanisms may be responsible for flaring .",
    "polarization variability can be decorrelated from total intensity variability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and each shows variability on time scales ranging from tens of minutes to hours ( and possibly longer ) . spatial resolution will be key to deciphering the environment of sgr  a * , and thus there is a critical need for polarimetric millimeter - wavelength vlbi .",
    "our results are generalizable to any mechanism producing changes in linear polarization , whether due to orbiting or spiralling hot spots , jets , disk instabilities , or any other mechanism in the inner disk of sgr  a*. visibility ratios on baselines available for millimeter - wavelength vlbi will provide reasonably robust observables to detect changes in the polarization structure on relevant scales from a few to a few hundred @xmath4 , regardless of the cause of those changes .",
    "clearly , periodicity can only be detected if the underlying mechanism that produces polarization changes is itself periodic , but baseline visibility ratios will be sensitive to any changes that are rapid compared to the rotation of the earth .",
    "future millimeter - wavelength vlbi observations of sgr  a * should clearly be observed in dual - polarization unless not allowed by telescope limitations .",
    "total - intensity analysis via closure quantities , as outlined in paper i , can be performed regardless of whether the data are taken in single- or dual - polarization mode , but the cross - hand correlations can only be obtained from dual - polarization data .",
    "the cross - hand correlation data provide additional chances to detect variability via changing source polarization structure .    by virtue of its size and location , which produces medium - length baselines to chile and hawaii as well as a long window of mutual visibility with chile ,",
    "the lmt is a very useful telescope .",
    "the sensitivities assumed in this work for first light on the lmt may lead to biased amplitude ratios on the hawaii - lmt baseline ( fig .",
    "[ fig - amp230 ] ) , but this will not prevent detection of periodicity ( fig .  [ fig - acfs ] ) .",
    "thus , strong consideration should be given in favor of including the lmt in a millimeter - wavelength vlbi array observing sgr  a * as soon as possible .",
    "if the parameters of the fully - completed lmt are assumed , the bias disappears and the scatter of points on the hawaii - lmt baseline in figure  [ fig - amp230 ] is similar to that seen on the shorter hawaii - carma baseline , and baselines between continental north america and the lmt will be of comparably good snr to the lower - resolution pv - pdb baseline .",
    "eventually , the lmt and alma will be the most sensitive stations in a millimeter vlbi array and will enable sensitive modelling of the sgr  a * system .    if possible , it would be advantageous to obtain connected - element interferometric data of sgr  a * simultaneously with vlbi data .",
    "while amplitude ratios and phase differences on the pv - pdb and ( to a lesser extent ) smt - carma baselines track the large - scale polarization fraction and evpa fairly well in these models , it is not known what fraction of the polarization structure arises from larger - scale emission in sgr  a*. if interferometer stations can be configured to produce both cross - correlations betweeen telescopes as well as a phased output of all telescopes together , opportunities for simultaneous connected - element interferometry may exist with the pdb interferometer , the sma , carma , or alma .",
    "if system limitations prevent this , it may still be possible to acquire very - short - spacing data with those telescopes in carma or alma that are not phased together for vlbi .",
    "( sub)millimeter - wavelength vlbi polarimetry is a very valuable diagnostic of emission processes and dynamics near the event horizon of sgr  a*. we summarize the findings in this paper as follows :    * millimeter - wavelength polarimetric vlbi can detect changing source structures . despite low polarization fractions seen with connected - element interferometry",
    ", the much higher angular resolution data provided by vlbi will be far less affected by beam depolarization and contamination from dust polarization .",
    "polarimetric vlbi provides an orthogonal way to detect periodic structural changes as compared with total intensity vlbi .",
    "* ratios of cross- to parallel - hand visibilities are robust baseline - based observables .",
    "short vlbi baselines approximately trace the integrated polarization fraction and position angle of the inner accretion flow of sgr  a * , while longer vlbi baselines resolve smaller structures .",
    "* calibration of instrumental polarization terms is not necessary to detect a changing source structure , including periodicity , in sgr  a*. * polarimetric vlbi may be able to disentangle the effects of rotation measure from intrinsic source polarization .",
    "initial results will likely come from observations of the timescale of polarimetric variability .",
    "if the initial array is expanded to allow high - fidelity imaging , polarimetric vlbi may be able to map the faraday rotation region and directly infer the density and magnetic field structure of the emitting region in sgr  a*."
