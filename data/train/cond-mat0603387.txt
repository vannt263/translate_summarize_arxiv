    "in the last years , fractal structures with noninteger hausdorff dimension ( @xmath2 ) have attracted the interest of researchers because these systems , besides serving to model natural materials such as porous rocks , aerogel , etc . @xcite , also offer the possibility of theoretically exploring systems exhibiting critical behavior close to their lower critical dimension , i.e. , the larger integer dimension in which the system does not exhibit any phase transition at a finite temperature .",
    "the first studies of phase transitions using fractal structures are those of gefen and co - workers @xcite . based on renormalization methods",
    ", it has been shown that a second - order phase transition at nonzero temperature occurs only if the fractal substrate has an infinite ramification order .",
    "moreover , since translational symmetry is a necessary condition to proceed with dimensional perturbation @xcite , the disagreement between the critical exponents determined by current methods @xcite and those obtained by continuation of @xmath3expansions to noninteger dimension @xcite can be related to the topological features of the fractal structure .",
    "it is well known that for systems with translational symmetry , the influence of the underlying structure becomes negligible at the critical point , i.e. , when the correlation length    is much larger than the cell spacing , and only the dimensionality , the number of components of the order parameter together with its symmetry and the nature of the couplings concur to determine the values of the critical exponents and the corresponding universality class",
    ". however , in fractal systems , where the translational symmetry is replaced by scale invariance , the topological details of the generating cell are present at any scale and such universal behavior is said to be weak .",
    "the critical exponents and the critical temperature depend not only on @xmath2 , but also on the connectivity and lacunarity of the fractal @xcite .",
    "a direct quantitative study of topological effects has been recently published @xcite .",
    "most of the previously cited studies are based on the same type of fractal , i.e. , the sierpiski carpet ( sc ) , which has an infinite ramification order .",
    "although the same kind of magnetic interaction ( ising model ) has been considered , these previous studies yield controversial results .",
    "table [ tab1 ] summarizes the list of published results for the case of the two dimensional sc with @xmath4 , where the generating cell is built by segmenting a square into nine subsquares and removing the central one , so that this fractal is termed sc(3,1 ) .",
    "in particular , different values have been obtained by different authors for the critical temperature ( @xmath5 , see table [ tab1 ] ) , which in most cases is lower than @xmath6 of the ising model in 2d . also , a considerable scattering in the data corresponding to the critical exponents @xmath7 and @xmath8 can be observed .",
    "it should also be noticed that monte carlo simulations and fss may either predict @xmath9 @xcite or @xmath10 @xcite .",
    ".list of critical temperatures and critical exponents reported in the literature for the ising model in the sc(3,1 ) fractal .",
    "the methods used to obtain the data are : rsgr @xmath11 real space group renormalization ; mc - fss @xmath11 monte carlo simulations and finite - size scaling ; mc - rng @xmath12 monte carlo renormalization group ; mc - slope @xmath11 monte carlo simulations and the slope method @xcite .",
    "the index @xmath13 indicates the generation of fractal used .",
    "the boundary conditions ( bc ) used are either periodic ( p ) or free ( f ) . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     on the other hand , the decay of the autocorrelation function ( see figure [ fig6 ] ) slightly depends on @xmath14 , allowing us to confirm our estimation , namely @xmath15 , and the corresponding error bars , already evaluated using simulations started from ordered configurations .",
    "the exponent @xmath16 evaluated by fitting the data at criticality ( see inset of figure [ fig6 ] ) is also listed in table [ tab5 ] .",
    "it is worth mentioning that by inserting the value of @xmath17 already determined in the exponent of the autocorrelation function , one can also calculate @xmath18 , as listed in the 4th column of table [ tab5 ] .",
    "the obtained results are in full agreement with the determination performed by starting simulations from ordered states , see table [ tab4 ] .",
    "1.0 true cm    also , inserting the exponent @xmath19 determined by means of simulations started from the ordered state ( see the 2nd column of table [ tab4 ] ) in the expression of the exponent of the second moment of the magnetization , given by @xmath20 , one can obtain an additional estimation of @xmath18 , as listed in the 5th column of table [ tab5 ] , which is slightly smaller than the estimations already performed by means of different procedures .",
    "we attribute this small difference to the propagation of errors in the evaluation of exponents by combining results from different measurements .",
    "1.0 true cm      although the application of fss techniques to the evaluation of critical exponents in systems with fractal structure is questionable , as we have already mentioned in the introduction , we used it at this point in order to obtain a first estimation of dynamic exponent @xmath1 .",
    "however , we will perform a critical analysis of the obtained results and subsequently we will perform a second ( more accurate ) estimation of @xmath1 .",
    "we carried out simulations up to @xmath21 mcs for segmentation steps @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively ) and determined the dynamic exponent @xmath1 using an fss analysis of the binder s cumulant .",
    "in fact , right at @xmath5 , the dynamic exponent @xmath1 can be determined from the binder s cumulant according to the following scaling relation    @xmath26    where @xmath27 .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] shows the data collapse obtained when the time scale of the system of size l@xmath28 size is rescaled by a factor @xmath29 .",
    "the results obtained by rescaling lattices of sizes @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "so , we observed a systematic decrease in @xmath1 when the segmentation step of the fractal is increased , and consequently it is no longer valid to set a single value of the dynamic exponent for all segmentation steps .",
    "this observed behavior is similar to an observation reported previously @xcite where the fixed point intersection of the binder s cumulant for different sizes was replaced by a sequence of intersection points occurring at `` effective '' critical temperatures , while the actual critical temperature was defined as the limit for @xmath35 .",
    "1.0 true cm    summing up , the fss method applied to the dynamic behavior of binder s cumulant only allow us to establish an upper bound to the dynamic exponent given by @xmath36 .    in order to obtain an independent estimation of the dynamic exponent @xmath1 that does nt involve calculations with segmentation steps smaller than 6 we study the scaling behaviour of the time correlation function :    @xmath37 ,   \\label{ec91}\\ ] ]    where @xmath38 indicates a site displaced by @xmath39 lattice spacings relative to site @xmath40 .",
    "our purpose is to study the onset of correlations between spins when an initially completely disordered system ( @xmath41 ) has been quenched to @xmath42 .",
    "conventional critical scaling implies the following scaling form for @xmath43 :    @xmath44    assuming that the hyperscaling relation given by @xmath45 holds for this system , and using @xmath46 , we may replace @xmath47 in equation ( [ ec92 ] ) by @xmath48 .",
    "as @xmath49 has already been obtained directly in the simulations from the decay of the magnetization from the ordered state ( equation ( [ ec6 ] ) ) , and @xmath50 is expected to behave as @xmath51 , we may plot    @xmath52    and look for the value of @xmath1 that make the curves to collapse .",
    "this procedure has been applied for humayun and bray @xcite to obtain @xmath1 for the ising model for @xmath53 .    in figure [ fig9 ]",
    "we show plots of @xmath43 as a function of @xmath54 obtained for different values of @xmath39 ranging from 4 to 23 .",
    "the inset shows the best collapse of the curves obtained for @xmath55 .",
    "this value was obtained performing a fit of the scaled data to a 4-parameter function given by    @xmath56    that we have empirically found to fit the data quiet well .",
    "we have also checked that other functional dependences for @xmath57 that also fit the data only modifies the value of @xmath1 by less than 0.01 .",
    "the obtained value for @xmath58 , i.e. @xmath59 is consistent with the trend observed from the fss analysis of binder s cumulant and sets our upper bound for the dynamic exponent .",
    "1.0 true cm    the relationship @xmath60 has been determined quite accurately by using three different kinds of measurements : the binder s cumulant , the slope of the second moment of the order parameter and the autocorrelation function ( see table [ tab4 ] ) .",
    "so , taking @xmath61 the effective dimension becomes @xmath62 , i.e. a figure that is noticeably smaller than the haussdorf dimension @xmath63 of the sc(3,1 ) .",
    "it should be noted that previous estimations using fss studies gave values of @xmath64 very close to @xmath65 ( for a compilation of published results see table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "however , pruessner _ et .",
    "@xcite , have estimated @xmath66 , also smaller than the haussdorf dimension .",
    "on the other hand , using the value @xmath67 determined from the slope of the logarithmic derivative of the order parameter ( see equation ( [ ec7 ] ) and @xmath61 , our estimation for the lower bound of the correlation length exponent becomes @xmath68 , which is significantly larger than the exact value of the ising model given by @xmath69 .",
    "it is shown that the short - time dynamics approach is a powerful method for the study of the critical behavior of the ising model embedded in a fractal structure , where the translational symmetry is changed for the scale invariance .",
    "this method allows us to obtain a self - consistent determination of the critical temperature and the complete set of the critical exponents .",
    "this self - consistence is achieved by using three different initial conditions for the study of the dynamics .",
    "the critical temperature determined in the present work for @xmath70 ( an upper bound for this system ) is in agreement with the value reported by prussener et al .",
    "@xcite , which was obtained from equilibrium measurements .",
    "we note that these authors have used the slope method , a procedure that is free of the finite size effects involved in fss calculations . a critical discussion of the values reported by other authors employing different techniques is presented in the discussion of the results listed in tables [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] .",
    "the exponent @xmath0 of the initial increase in @xmath71 determined for the segmentation step @xmath58 and extrapolated to the @xmath72 limit is slightly smaller than the value corresponding to the two dimensional ising model ( see table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "our result is also in agreement with that reported by zheng et al .",
    "@xcite , obtained by locating the spins at the vertices of the sc(3,1 ) and for the same segmentation step . in this way , these results suggest that the fractal structure does not significantly affect the exponent @xmath0 .",
    "the dynamic exponent @xmath1 has been obtained by means of two independent measurements .",
    "binder s cumulant method allow us to determine the decreasing trend of @xmath1 when @xmath13 is increased , so we obtained an upper bound given by @xmath73 .",
    "further analysis of correlation functions allow us to improve the estimation of such an upper bound which is given by @xmath61 .",
    "our value for the exponent @xmath74 of the order parameter for the segmentation step @xmath58 , is also in agreement with the trend of the results reported by pruessner et al .",
    "@xcite for segmentation steps @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( see table ii ) , suggesting that our estimation can be taken as a lower bound .",
    "this value is only slightly smaller than the exact exponent corresponding to the 2d ising magnet , namely @xmath77 .",
    "so , we should not disregard the possibility that for @xmath78 the order parameter critical exponent may adopt the same value for both systems .    on the other hand , our estimations of the exponents @xmath79 of the susceptibility and @xmath80 of the correlation length ,",
    "are significantly larger than those obtained for the 2d ising system , namely @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively . observing the trend reported by pruessner et al .",
    "@xcite ( see table ii ) it is expected that our estimation for @xmath83 could be taken as a lower bound .",
    "also , @xmath84 may be taken as a lower bound because it is evaluated from the measurement of @xmath85 that involves our estimation of an upper bound for @xmath1 .",
    "finally we would like to remark that due to the huge statistic achieved in the evaluation of the dynamic properties , a soft oscillation around the power - law decay of the magnetization was observed at criticality ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the same oscillation was also observed for the disordered initial state in the behavior of the autocorrelation ( see figure [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "the oscillation can clearly be detected by subtracting the fitted power law from the actual data , as shown in figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "this oscillation is very nicely reproduced in both measurements ( up to t @xmath88 in figure [ fig8 ] ) and , to the best of our knowledge this is the first evidence reported about this interesting behavior of the dynamic properties of the ising model in a fractal substrate .",
    "we have clear signs that the observed oscillations are related to the topological properties of the fractal lattice .",
    "a more detailed investigation of these oscillations for the sc(3,1 ) and other fractals will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we would finally like to remark the self - consistency of our results obtained upon the application of the std method to the study of the critical behavior of the ising model on fractal structures .",
    "however , it should be recognized that there are still discrepancies in the values of the critical exponents when std - results are compared to those obtained using standard finite - size scaling of equilibrium data .",
    "for example , in contrast to our data , recent fss results of carmona et al @xcite and monceau et al .",
    "@xcite lead to an effective dimension almost equal to the hausdorff one .",
    "so , we conclude that the origin of the discrepancies may be related to the fact that the critical behavior of the ising magnet on fractal substrata is very particular , since it is linked to the dependence of most physical observable upon the number of iteration steps of the structure .",
