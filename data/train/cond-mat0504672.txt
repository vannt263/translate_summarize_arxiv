    "starting quite a long time ago , auluck and kothari @xcite , then may @xcite and finally viefers , ravndal , and haugset @xcite , discovered idependently that the specific heat of nonrelativistic ideal gases in two - dimensional ( 2d ) boxes does not depend on the exclusion statistics .",
    "this interesting result eventually did not receive the attention it deserved until 1995 , when lee @xcite rederived it by introducing an unified way of writing the thermodynamic properties of ideal gases in terms of polylogarithmic functions @xcite .",
    "this formulation represented also an important extension of the auluck and kothari result and triggered further investigations ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "since under _",
    "canonical conditions _ a bose and its corresponding fermi gas are similar at the thermodynamic level , they have been called _",
    "thermodynamically equivalent_. if we denote by @xmath0 the heat capacity of a system at temperature @xmath1 , volume @xmath2 and particle number @xmath3 , then the heat capacities @xmath4 and @xmath5 of two thermodnamically equivalent systems are identical functions of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . using this property ,",
    "all the thermodynamic systems may be divided into equivalence classes @xcite and by doing this one may observe that all the systems of ideal particles of the same constant density of states ( dos ) , but obeying bose , fermi , or even _ fractional exclusion statistics _",
    "@xcite , belong to the same equivalence class @xcite .",
    "the equivalence between bose and fermi gases was critically examined by pathria @xcite .",
    "he showed that the lee s unified formulation of 2d ideal gases does not hold anymore below the bose - einstein condensation temperature of the bose gas .",
    "aparently , the 2d ( or , more exactly , constant dos ) _ thermodynamic equivalence holds only above the bose - einstein condensation temperature_.    on the other hand , crescimanno and landsberg @xcite and one of us @xcite showed that there is a one - to - one mapping between microscopic configurations of bosons , fermions or haldons , in systems with the same , constant dos , which preserves the total excitation energy ( i.e. the energy of the particles in the given configuration minus the energy of the system at zero kelvins is the same ) . based on this theorem ,",
    "the thermodynamic equivalence of systems with equally spaced spectra _",
    "should hold at any temperature in any detail _",
    ", so pathria s conclusion must be wrong .",
    "but what was overlooked there ?",
    "the method of mapping microscopic configurations between systems of different exclusion statistics introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite for systems with constant dos was extended in ref .",
    "@xcite for systems with any dos and was called _ exclusion statistics transformation _",
    "systems connected by est are thermodynamically equivalent by construction .",
    "if we take for example a fermi system , transform it by est into a bose system , and then calculate independently the thermodynamical properties of these two systems by maximizing the entropy in each of them , for constant @xmath6 ( total energy ) and @xmath3  i.e. assuming grandcanonical distribution on the single particle energy levels  we loose again the thermodynamic equivalence that we started with , at least is most of the cases @xcite !",
    "the obvious conclusion is that one or both of these grandcanonical distributions lead to results in dezacord with the canonical ensemble .",
    "the question which of these grandcanonical distribution is closest to the canonical distribution is very dificult to answer , since _ ab initio _ canonical calculations are not easy to perform on general , large systems .",
    "the concept of fermi condensate was introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite . for a general system , of spectrum consisting of single particle energy levels @xmath7 ( we enumerate them such that @xmath8 )",
    ", one can calculate the grandcanonical probability , @xmath9 , of having the lowest @xmath10 energy levels occupied , the level @xmath11 free and all the other energy levels with any occupation number @xcite : @xmath12\\cdot{{\\mathcal z}_{\\rm ex}}(n_0,\\beta,\\beta\\mu ) \\equiv \\frac{{{\\mathcal z}}_{n_0}}{{{\\mathcal z } } } \\ , .\\ ] ] here @xmath13 is the partition function of the system and @xmath14\\right\\}$ ] is the partition function of the levels @xmath15 .",
    "obviously , @xmath16 the probability distribution ( [ wn0 ] ) may have a maximum at , say @xmath17 .",
    "the statistical interpretation of such a maximum is that in a physical system in contact with a particle reservoir , the lowest @xmath18 energy levels are always occupied .",
    "these @xmath10 particles form the _ fermi condensate_. at any finite temperature , @xmath10 is subject to fluctuations , denoted by @xmath19 .",
    "the configurations of fermions may be transformed by est into configurations of bosons @xcite . by this transformation",
    "the @xmath10 degenerate fermions will be transformed into the bose - einstein condensate of the corresponding bose system , and hence the name of fermi condensate .",
    "for this reason the degenerate fermions will also be called fermi condensate . for canonical bose systems of constant dos ,",
    "the probability distribution of having @xmath10 particles in the condensate , @xmath20 , have been studied in detail before ( see for example ref.@xcite for a review ) . by construction ,",
    "the canonical probability distribution of having @xmath10 fermions in the condensate is also @xmath20 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that in a system of constant density of states , @xmath17  which corresponds to the maximum of @xmath9 ( [ wn0 ] )  is close to the average canonical ocupation of the ground state , but the two numbers are not the same .",
    "the distribution @xmath9 is not symmetric around the maximum , so @xmath21 ( where by @xmath22 and @xmath23 we shall denote grandcanonical and canonical averages , respectively ) . since if the bose and fermi condensates are separated from the rest of the particles , the grandcanonical bose and fermi distributions map onto each - other ( see section 5 , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the average number of particles in the fermi condensate should be equal to the average ocupation of the bosonic ground state and in the fermi system below the condensation temperature the usual fermi distribution applies only to the particles above the condensate .",
    "for simplicity , to the fermions above the condensate we shall refer to as the particles in the _ thermally active layer_.    it is well known that fermi canonical and grandcanonical ensembles are equivalent . in this paper",
    "we shall investigate the equivalence between the grandcanonical description of the fermi gas and its correspondent canonical description in terms of the bose gas .",

    "@xcite and which seems not to hold for general systems . here",
    "we shall discuss the simplest systems , namely the ones with constant density of states , @xmath24 , and we shall compare @xmath9 and @xmath20 .",
    "an important parameter of the system is the quantity @xmath25 . for large @xmath25 we can do some analytical calculations , assuming that @xmath9 has a gaussian shape , but , as we shall see in seection [ analytical ]",
    ", this approximation is not too good for the evaluation of @xmath26 , the mean square fluctuation of @xmath10 . to correct this and to extend our calculations to lower values of @xmath25 , in section [ exact ] we do numerical calculations of @xmath9 , @xmath20 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "( for simplicity we use the somewhat simpler notations @xmath26 and @xmath27 instead of the more rigorous @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively . )",
    "we reobtain the known result : @xmath30 , i.e. the mean square fluctuation of @xmath10 is of the same order as the number of particles in the thermally active layer or the number of particles on the excited states in the bose gas .",
    "we also obtain that @xmath31 converge to a constant value , 0.39 , as @xmath25 increases .",
    "this asymptotic behavior is proved analytically by the end of section [ exact ] .",
    "first we analyse eq . ( [ wn0 ] ) analytically in the limit @xmath32 . to do this we take @xmath33 , and transform all the summations into integrals .",

    "the thermodynamic equivalence between ideal bosons and fermions with the same constant density of states @xmath24 @xcite apparently is lost below the bose - einstein condensation temperature @xcite . on the other hand",
    "it was proven that if the bose and the fermi systems have the same spectrum consisting of nondegenerate , equidistant single particle states ( like for example particles in a one - dimensional harmonic potential ) , then the canonical thermodynamic equivalence between the two systems is preserved down to zero temperature in the smallest details @xcite .",
    "this apparent contradiction is due to the fact that below the condensation temperature @xmath138 , in the fermi gas the values of intensive parameters like the chemical potential and also the population of single particle levels in the canonical ensemble are changed slightly from their corresponding values in the grandcanonical ensemble .",
    "below @xmath138 , to the bose - einstein condensate in the bose system it corresponds in the fermi system a degenerate gas of the same number of particles , at the lowest part of the spectrum .",
