    "together with very small thickness , extreme sharp edges in rings of saturn are one of the most outstanding features of planetary rings ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , for example the outer b ring edge has a density drop by an order of magnitude on a distance @xmath0 that is enormously sharp compared to the edge distance to saturn ( @xmath1 ) , the b ring width ( @xmath2 ) and the width of cassini division ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this is especially surprising since the life time of the rings is enormously large being of about @xmath4 orbital periods @xcite and the particles inside the b ring are quite dense ( e.g. there are particles of size @xmath5 down to @xmath6 and smaller with a distance between them of about a few meters and less ) @xcite . due to this",
    "about @xmath7 collisions between particles per orbit should wash out all sharp density contrasts in only a few orbital periods .    in many cases , and perhaps always , these sharp edges are associated with the gravitational perturbation by a moon inside or outside the rings .",
    "the abruptness of the transition from nearly opaque to practically transparent regions was constrained by the voyager photopolarimeter data @xcite to be smaller than about 100 meters .",
    "cassini uvis occultation profiles show edges sharper than tens of meters , and in fact the assumption of a knife - edge sharpness is used to constrain the local ring thickness near the edge to be on the order of 5 meters only ( @xcite ; ring thickness and sharpness of the edge should be of the same order ) .    after the pioneering work of @xcite",
    "extensive numerical simulations of particle dynamics have been performed by different groups ( see e.g. @xcite ) that allowed to establish a number of interesting properties of ring dynamics .",
    "however , the problem of sharp ring edges still remains a mystery .",
    "its solution requires extensive large scale numerical simulations with particles of different scales , it also may require to go beyond local box simulations invented by @xcite .",
    "in view of these difficulties it seems to be useful to explore certain simplified models that bring to surface new qualitative physical effects which can be analyzed more directly due to model simplicity . here",
    ", we introduce such a simplified model of ring dynamics for outer b ring edge called the sync model in the following .",
    "numerical investigations of this model show a striking phenomenon of synchronization of the epicycle motions of particles in the ring induced , under certain conditions , by a periodical gravitational force of mimas . in a general context , the synchronization phenomenon , which has abundant manifestations in science , nature",
    ", engineering and social life @xcite , can be roughly described as an adjustment of frequencies and phases of oscillators due to interaction and/or forcing . in the present context ,",
    "the phases of the epicycle rotation of various particles become synchronized with the phase of periodic gravitational force of mimas , and as a result the collisions between particles become suppressed by orders of magnitude so that the diffusion in the ring also becomes suppressed by orders of magnitude .",
    "this leads to a maintaince of sharp edges in a certain frequency range of ratios of epicycle frequency @xmath8 to the mimas frequency @xmath9 .",
    "we note that the data of the cassini mission show that the outer b ring edge has the frequency @xmath10 which is very close to @xmath11 resonance with mimas frequency @xmath9 , actually @xmath12 that corresponds to the accuracy in coordinate position of about @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "thus @xmath10 is located directly in the middle of the synchronization arnold tongue where the synchronization effects are the strongest . as a noticeable remark",
    "we mention , that it was christiaan huygens who discovered both the saturn s rings ( see , e.g. references in book  @xcite ) and the synchronization phenomenon ( see , e.g. references in book  @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is composed as follows : the sync model of dynamics in the ring is described in section 2 ( with additional details given in appendix a , b ) , the numerical and analytical results are presented in section 3 , the discussion of the results is given in section 4 .",
    "the sync model of the ring dynamics is based on the four main ingredients :    1 .",
    "the individual particle dynamics is given by the hill equations and is considered in a local box as it is proposed by @xcite , the particles are assumed to be identical , the dynamics is considered only in the two - dimensional plane of the ring ; 2 .   the gravitational force of mimas is considered as a sequence of periodic kicks of fixed amplitude ; 3 .   the collisions between particles are treated on the basis of the mesoscopic multi - particle collision model proposed by kapral ( see e.g @xcite ) ; 4 .   the total energy balance ( the process where the injection of energy provided by the shear flow @xcite and the gravitational force of mimas is equilibrated by dissipation ) is ensured via the nos - hoover thermostat which is broadly used in molecular dynamics simulations of large ensembles of interacting particles ( see e.g @xcite ) .",
    "let us now describe the elements of the model in more details :    \\(i ) the hill equations of motion inside a local box @xcite are @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the kepler frequency of a particle of mass @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the kepler shear velocity , @xmath19 is the gravitational force of mimas along axis @xmath20 directed to saturn . here",
    "@xmath21 are velocities of local motion in the presence of the shear flow . with @xmath22 and the radius @xmath23",
    "we have at the edge of b ring @xmath24 .",
    "we normalize all velocities by a typical value of epicycle velocity @xmath25 that gives us equations of motion in a dimensionless form .",
    "after that the distance is measured in units of a typical epicycle radius @xmath26 and time @xmath27 is replaced by @xmath28 .",
    "the local box has the periodic boundary conditions as those used by @xcite .",
    "the size of the box is usually taken as a square @xmath29 . in presence of the nos - hoover thermostat ( see ( iv ) ) and the shear flow we found convenient to use the hamiltonian form of the hill equations as it is described by @xcite . in this formulation the hamiltonian of the epicycle motion has the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the action of the oscillator motion .",
    "more details are given in appendix a.    \\(ii ) the computation of the field strength @xmath32 is described in appendix b. because mimas passes the local box rather fast , the force in dimensionless units has a form of periodic delta - function @xmath33 with the period @xmath34 defined by the dimensionless orbital period of mimas @xmath35 and dimensionless kick strength @xmath36 corresponding to the fixed choice of the typical epicycle velocity @xmath37 .",
    "the force in @xmath38-direction is neglected since it is much smaller compared to the force in @xmath20-direction and gives a small change of @xmath39 compared to the shear velocity .",
    "\\(iii ) the collisions of particles are performed according to the kapral algorithm @xcite .",
    "namely , the whole local box @xmath40 is divided on @xmath41 cells .",
    "usually we use about @xmath42 cells with the total number of particles @xmath43 corresponding to @xmath44 particles inside one epicycle circle and the particle density in a cell being @xmath45 . after a time @xmath46",
    "the relative velocities ( with respect to the motion of the center of mass of the cell ) of all particles in a given cell are rotated by a random angle . in this way the total momentum and energy inside a given cell are preserved while the directions of the velocities become mixed .",
    "it is important to note that during the collision the velocities inside the cell are taken as the total physical velocities of particles , namely @xmath47 including the shear velocity .",
    "thus , due to a finite size of the kapral cells , the shear velocity always generates appearance of a spreading of local velocities @xmath21 : even if @xmath48 and @xmath39 of two particles coincide before the `` collision '' , this is not true for the total velocities @xmath47 , and random rotation of the latter leads to the appearance of non - equal @xmath21 . in a certain sense",
    "the finite size of kapral cells physically acts as a finite size of colliding bodies .",
    "usually we used @xmath49 but the variation of this parameter did not affect the main results .",
    "\\(iv ) in presence of collisions the shear flow and the driving mimas force inject additional energy in the system , that is dissipated via different mechanisms , including nonelasiticity of collisions , interactions with dust , etc . in our simplified model , to keep the energy balance , we use the nos - hoover thermostat which is commonly used for molecular dynamics simulations of interacting particles , also in presence of external fields @xcite . in this thermostat , which mimics a canonical ensemble , an additional friction force acts on a particle @xmath50 according to @xmath51/{\\tau_h}^2\\ ] ] where @xmath52 are the momentum and coordinate of particle @xmath50 , @xmath53 is an effective `` friction '' force acting on a particle due to collisions and external fields , @xmath54 is the relaxation time in the nh thermostat [ usually we used @xmath55 but we also checked that the variation of @xmath54 does not affect the synchronization phenomenon ( see examples below ) ] and @xmath56 means the average over all @xmath57 particles , @xmath58 is a given temperature of the thermostat .",
    "one can see that the `` friction '' changes the sign with @xmath59 , and the variable @xmath59 is driven by the deviations of the mean kinetic energy from that at the given temperature @xmath60 , in this way the system is kept near this temperature as it should be for the canonical ensemble .    for the hamiltonian form of the hill equations ,",
    "the friction acts only on the action variable that gives in dimensionless variables @xmath61/{\\tau_h}^2 $ ] , where @xmath62 means the averaging over all @xmath57 particles ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the physical origin of the appearance of such an effective friction can be attributed to an average friction force acting on a relatively large particle as a result of multiple collisions with a dust of small size particles .    in a ring with extended size distribution",
    "the smaller particles have in equilibrium generally larger dispersion velocities @xcite .",
    "since the collisions are inelastic , the system does however not assume a state of energy equipartition . typically , the dispersion velocity of the smallest particles is by a factor of several larger than the one of the largest particles , depending mildly on the width of the size distribution and the inelasticity of the particles .    at opposition",
    "the perturbing moon induces an equal excess velocity @xmath63 to all ring particles , regardless of their size .",
    "this means that compared to collisional equilibrium the large particles have now a higher excess in random kinetic energy than the small ones . in this sense",
    "the return to equilibrium , mediated by dissipative collisions , affords a cooling of the large particles relative to the small ones , and thus , an effective friction on large particles .",
    "this friction vanishes in equilibrium like the nose - hoover thermostat .",
    "large particles determine the dynamical properties of the ring .",
    "another dissipative process could be an ongoing exchange of ring - matter between particles of all size groups due to a balance of coagulation and fragmentation ( dynamic ephemeral bodies , deb s , @xcite ) causing an effective dissipation , since the composition and destruction of agglomerates are irreversible processes .",
    "it is interesting to note that the epicycle dynamics is rather similar to motion of charged particles in a magnetic field @xcite and due to that there is a certain analogy with the synchronization of the larmor motion for two - dimensional electron gas in magnetic and microwave fields as it was discussed by @xcite .",
    "the main difference to the present problem is that for the electron gas there is no shear .",

    "for @xmath74 the distribution of velocities is close to the maxwell distribution of elliptical form appearing due to shear and ellipticity of motion given by the hill equations ( the distribution becomes close to a symmetric one in rescaled velocities @xmath75 ) .",
    "the distribution is drastically changed for @xmath76 : almost all density is concentrated on a spiral in the velocity plane .",
    "the physical meaning of this phenomenon is the following : for the resonant ratio @xmath77 the phases of the epicycle rotations become synchronized with the phase of periodic mimas kicks given by @xmath78 . while out of the resonance ( e.g. @xmath74 ) all epicycle phases are random and independent , in the synchronization regime they are all adjusted to the phase of mimas . as a result",
    ", mimas gives a kick in @xmath48 , between kicks the particle velocity decreases doing two rotations over the spiral , then again it is kicked by mimas in the same state as at previous kick , and so on .",
    "thus the phases of this rotational motion are equal to the phase of mimas and equal to each other .",
    "this means that the particles rotate in synchrony , at each moment of time their rotational velocities are equal both in the amplitude and in the direction .",

    "[ fig5 ] ) the decrease of density goes in a more smooth way ( on a scale of about @xmath164 ) .",
    "the difference of scales in two cases is not so large since in both cases the diffusion is zero in the region without particles .",
    "however , the most important difference is that the rapid diffusive propagation goes unlimitedly in the non - synchronized case while inside the synchronization window the propagation front moves very slowly with the formation of sharp density drop on a scale of about @xmath165 .",

    "our studies based on the sync model of dynamics in the rings of saturn show the emergence of synchronization in the vicinity of the outer b ring edge . like the maxwell demon this synchronization makes the epicycle motion of particles to be synchronous that practically eliminates collisions between them .",
    "this gives a suppression of diffusion by orders of magnitude and a formation of a diffusive shock wave slowly propagating inside the synchronization domain .",
    "the size of this front or the edge of the ring is of the order of a few epicycle radius being of about of a few tens of meters .",
    "this is in agreement with the present observation data which give its size to be about 10 meters .",
    "the size of the synchronization domain created by mimas is of the order of @xmath170 ( remarkably , the total number of synchronized particles , which can be estimated as @xmath171 , is huge ) .",
    "the front moves most slowly in the center of the synchronization domain so that it is most probable to observe it at the exact resonance 2:1 between the edge frequency and the frequency of mimas .",
    "the observations show that the actual position is close to this value with a relative accuracy of @xmath172 .",
    "similar synchronization effects should exist at other resonances with other satellites .",
    "our preliminary data give a similar picture for the outer a ring edge which is closely located to the 7:6 resonance with janus ( here the dimensionless kick strength is @xmath173 but the relative frequency size of the synchronization window is approximately twice smaller due to higher order of the resonance ) .",
    "the synchronization mechanism proposed here can also be responsible for existence of very narrow planetary rings .",
    "indeed , if initially particles are distributed inside the resonance then those which are inside the synchronization window will remain there practically forever since the collision induced diffusion is switched off , while those outside of the window will diffuse away living a narrow ring of particles inside the synchronization window .    the sync model used in this paper is based on several significant simplifications of the real particle dynamics .",
    "the use of the mesoscopic kapral method for incorporating the collisions appears to imply no additional physical mechanisms , but the basic physics of the collisions remains hidden inside the parameters of the kapral method - the number of the cells and the frequency of the reshuffling of velocities . to make the calculations more realistic",
    ", one needs to incorporate realistic collision models with reasonable mechanical properties of the particles , to include a distribution of the sizes , etc .",
    "such an extension goes far beyond the scope of our preliminary study .",
    "thus we can hardly make direct predictions , in particular , compare properties of a and b ring edges .",
    "moreover , it appears that another simplification of our computational model  the use of the nos - hoover thermostat  is less `` repairable '' and requires a further justification .",
    "indeed , if there is some average dissipation due to particle collisions , this justifies the use of the thermostat for modeling the saturation of the energy pumped to the system due to shear . on the other hand , in our setup in the synchronized state collisions",
    "are rare so at the first glance there is no mechanism for energy saturation . here",
    "it is important to mention , that we restricted our analysis to an ensemble of identical particles . for a particular situation in the outer b ring",
    "this means that we consider only large particles that have low characteristic epicyclic velocities .",
    "if there is a whole range of particles of different sizes , they are all subject to resonant kicks by mimas , but because their characteristic epicyclic velocities are different , the effect of the kicks is also different .",
    "if we assume rough equipartition of epicylic kinetic energies , then smaller particles have larger velocities , therefore for them the effective forcing parameter @xmath79 is smaller , and as a result they only weakly synchronize or not synchronize ( if they lie near the bottom of fig .  [ fig2 ] ) . collisions with these randomly moving particles",
    "may provide an additional dissipation that justifies the use of the nos - hoover thermostat .",
    "further investigations ( which however go far beyond the scope of this paper ) of different dissipation effects influencing the energy balance are needed to clarify this issue .",
    "another simplification made  a consideration of a relatively small box of particles  is also crucial .",
    "indeed , parts of the ring at different angular coordinates are statistically equivalent , but the dynamical equivalence is broken by the influence of mimas , as the latter kicks the particles at different phases .",
    "thus the synchrony of the velocities may be only local , i.e. the velocities of particles are synchronized with the local phase of the mimas , but this phase changes gradually along the ring angular coordinate . because of the differential rotation , the particles synchronized at different phases will mix , but this effect is not taken into account in the box model , it has to be addressed in future studies .    in this respect",
    "the important issue is that of how the synchronization of particles velocities could be tested experimentally .",
    "indeed , the theory above predicts a drastic narrowing of the width of the velocities distribution , cf .",
    "however , because the velocities themselves are very small , there is no much hope to observe the distribution of them directly , e.g. by doppler measurements or image analysis .",
    "thus one has to rely on implicit observations .",
    "for example , one may expect that the adjustment of velocities influences other dynamical features recently observed in the rings , like propeller structures ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , for such an implicit test one has to find such structures quite near to the sharp edges described above .",
    "remarkably , near the outer edge of ring b a scrambled pattern is observed in recent cassini images ( see url : http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/photos/imagedetails/  index.cfm?imageid=2984 ) that is probably due to a gravitational clumping of particle ( cf .",
    "simulations by @xcite of a similar structure at the encke gap ) .",
    "we can speculate that the synchronization of large particles would generally enhance their ability to clump due to gravitational and adhesive forces , because their relative collision velocities become rather small . on the other hand ,",
    "if smaller , non - synchronized particles , leave the ring and enter the gap , where large particles are missing , their diffusion will be reduced as well , because the collisions between small particles are rare .",
    "observation of such a gradient in the size distribution of particles near the edge may also be interpreted as an implicit confirmation of the suggested mechanism .",
    "we note that in the literature several mechanisms for explanation of sharp edges of rings have been discussed .",
    "one process to form and maintain a sharpness is a shear reversal induced by a strong gravitational perturbation near a resonance with a moon . in the unperturbed ring keplerian shear",
    "leads to an outward viscous transport of angular momentum .",
    "the distortions induced by a perturber may locally reverse the shear and , when integrating over the azimuth , to a net angular momentum transport that is directed radially inward @xcite .",
    "this process can lead to an inward migration of material from the close vicinity of the resonance location with the moon , and in this way clear a gap at this radial position in the ring .",
    "recently lewis et al . reported on a `` negative diffusion '' mechanism , where the particles migrate to areas of high density ( @xcite ) .",
    "in their calculations , however , only a single pass by the moon was simulated so no resonant effects , like those we focus on in this study , were possible .",
    "probably , further observations , together with further extensive numerical simulations , will allow one to test which mechanism is responsible for the sharp edges of the rings .",
    "it appears highly desirable to compare various setups in numerical simulations as well .",
    "finally , we note that , as discussed by @xcite , the elimination of collisional diffusion may appear also for charged particles in a magnetic field like 2d electron gas ( see @xcite ) and electron and ion clouds in a paul trap ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . due to",
    "that it can be rather interesting to try to make laboratory experiments with traps ( see e.g. @xcite ) which would allow to model rings of saturn in laboratory experiments with cold ions .",
