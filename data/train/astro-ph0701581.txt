    "in contrast , a large class of alternatives to cdm , here generically called warm dark matter ( wdm ) , are expected to have lower central densities and constant density cores at small radii @xcite . in the majority of wdm models ,",
    "phase space arguments predict that density cores will be more prominent in lower mass halos .",
    "current observations of the smallest rotationally - supported galaxies are somewhat ambiguous .",
    "some galaxies prefer cored halos , some prefer cusps , and others are well fit by either @xcite .",
    "moreover , the effects of non - circular motions and other systematic issues are yet to be sorted out for these systems .",
    "the dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) satellite galaxies of the milky way provide a potentially superior laboratory for studying the nature of dark matter .",
    "observationally , their proximity ( @xmath3 kpc ) allows kinematic studies of individual stars .",
    "theoretically , their small masses make them ideal candidates for prominent wdm cores .",
    "moreover , the cdm prediction of cuspy central density profiles is robust for these satellite systems because the cusps are stable to any tidal interactions that may have occurred @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , obtaining dsph density profile slopes has been difficult .",
    "the best current constraints on their mass profiles come from analyses of @xmath4 line - of - sight ( los ) velocities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the stellar velocity anisotropy is a major source of degeneracy in los velocity dispersion modeling , and , as we show below , the log - slope of the underlying density profile remains practically unconstrained even if the number of observed stars is increased by a factor of @xmath5 .    in this _",
    ", we examine the prospects of constraining the dark matter density profiles of dsphs by combining stellar los velocities with proper motion measurements .",
    "we show that @xmath4 proper motions at @xmath6 km s@xmath7 accuracy can break the relevant degeneracies and determine the dark matter distribution in the vicinity of the dsph stellar core radius , @xmath8 . specifically both the dark halo density and the local log - slope of the dark halo density profile at @xmath9 may be determined with @xmath10 times higher precision than from los velocity dispersion data alone . using two well - motivated examples of a cusp and core halo ,",
    "we show that the local log - slope measurement can distinguish between them at greater than the 3-@xmath11 level .",
    "we discuss our results in the context of nasa s _ sim planetquest _ ( space interferometry mission ) which will have the sensitivity to measure proper motions of stars at this accuracy in multiple dsphs .",
    "astrometry as a means to constrain the central density profiles of dsphs was previously considered by @xcite . using a two - parameter family of models for the dsphs",
    ", these authors show that proper motions will be enough to completely reconstruct the profile if the underlying shape follows their adopted form",
    ". however , cdm halos , and likely their wdm counterparts , are described by a minimum of four unknown parameters : a scale density , a scale radius , an _",
    "asymptotic _ inner slope , and an _",
    "asymptotic _ outer slope . by marginalizing over all of these parameters as well as the velocity anisotropy of the stars ,",
    "we demonstrate that the asymptotic slopes are never well - determined , even with proper motions .",
    "we show that what is best constrained is the log - slope , @xmath12 , at a radius @xmath13 comparable to the king core radius , specifically @xmath14 .",
    "we note that unlike the asymptotic @xmath15 slope , the log - slope at @xmath16 kpc is known from cdm simulations .",
    "this radius corresponds to @xmath17 of the relevant halo virial radius , and is well - resolved in current simulations .",
    "we define the three - dimensional ( spatial , not projected ) components of a star s velocity to be @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 . the velocity component along the line of sight is then @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the line - of - sight direction . the components parallel and tangential to the radius vector @xmath24 in the plane of the sky are @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively . for each component ,",
    "the velocity dispersion is defined as @xmath27 .",
    "we will assume @xmath28 .",
    "the velocity dispersion for each observed component can be constructed by solving the jeans equation for the three - dimensional stellar radial velocity dispersion profile @xmath29 and integrating along the line of sight .",
    "we note that even in the case of tidally disturbed dwarfs , @xcite have shown that dsph velocity dispersions are well modeled by the jeans equation , as long as unbound , interloper stars are removed with standard procedures .",
    "we derive the three resulting observable velocity dispersions : @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the stellar velocity anisotropy , @xmath32 is the surface density of stars , and @xmath33 is the three - dimensional density of stars .",
    "it is clear from inspection that each component depends on @xmath34 in a different fashion , and therefore can be used together to constrain its value . for @xmath32 and @xmath35 we use a king profile @xcite , which is characterized by a core radius , @xmath36 , and tidal radius , @xmath37 .",

    "we use @xmath49 , corresponding to a burkert profile @xcite .",
    "we take these two models to be representative of the predictions of cdm and wdm models .",
    "the burkert profile for the core case is motivated by the expectation that wdm halos will mimic cdm halos at large radius .",
    "this was seen in the wdm simulations of @xcite .",
    "the burkert choice is also conservative compared to the often - used isothermal core with @xmath50 , which is more divergent in shape from an nfw and would be easier to distinguish observationally .",
    "regardless , our methods are robust to changes in the underlying form of the density profile .",
    "( [ eq : densityprofile ] ) allows considerable flexibility in overall form , and the five _ shape _ parameters ( @xmath51 ) are in many cases degenerate .",
    "however , there are a number of physically relevant quantities that may be derived for any set of the five shape parameters .",
    "the first is the log - slope of the dark matter density profile , defined as @xmath52 . for the density profile in eq .",
    "( [ eq : densityprofile ] ) this is given by @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "other quantities of physical interest are the integrated mass within a given radius , @xmath54 , and the physical density at a given radius , @xmath55 , which are clearly obtained for a degenerate set of shape parameters .",
    "below , we show that while the _ shape _ parameters are not well constrained by dsph velocity data , the _ physical _ quantities of interest at the scale of the stellar core radius , @xmath56 , may be constrained to high precision .",
    "our goal is to estimate the accuracy with which the velocity components of stars in dsphs can be used to probe the underlying dark matter distribution . we will consider a model with six independent parameters : @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 constant",
    ". we will consider generalized @xmath60 forms below . in order to keep the profile shape relatively smooth ( as is expected for dark matter halo profiles ) we restrict the range of @xmath46 and @xmath47 by adding gaussian priors of @xmath61 .",
    "the errors attainable on these parameters will depend on the covariance matrix , which we will approximate by the @xmath62 fisher information matrix @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "the inverse of the fisher matrix , @xmath64 , provides an estimate of the covariance between the parameters , and @xmath65 approximates the error in the estimate on the parameter @xmath66 .",
    "the cramer - rao inequality guarantees that @xmath65 is the minimum possible variance on the @xmath67th parameter for an unbiased estimator . using @xmath64 in place of the true covariance matrix",
    "involves approximating the likelihood function of the parameters as gaussian near its peak , so @xmath64 will be a good approximation to the errors on parameters that are well - constrained .",

    "the power of velocity dispersions to constrain the density and mass at @xmath120 is relatively simple to understand by examining the observable velocity dispersion components ( eqs .",

    "with the constraints on @xmath132 , are we able to distinguish cored from cusped models ?",
    "to answer this question , in figure  [ fig : contours ] we present @xmath133 and @xmath134 error contours in the two - dimensional plane of @xmath132-@xmath34 .",
    "this figure clearly shows the utility of combining both los and proper motions . due to the degeneracy with @xmath34 ,",
    "a sample of @xmath135 line - of - sight stars is unable to distinguish between our two fiducial models , though the models can be clearly distinguished with the addition of proper motions . in the @xmath34-@xmath132 plane ,",
    "the principal constraining power comes from combining the los and @xmath136 velocity dispersions because the @xmath34 dependence in these two quantities comes with opposite signs ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : losdispersion ] ,  [ eq : rdispersion ] ) .",
    "finally , we address the fact that @xmath34 could in principle vary significantly with radius .",
    "we have repeated our analysis assuming that @xmath137 , and marginalize over @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "we find very small changes to the @xmath141 error .",
    "for reasons similar to those given above , the three different velocity dispersion profiles constrain @xmath142 to high accuracy , breaking the @xmath34-@xmath143 degeneracy .",
    "we have shown that the measurement of proper motions for @xmath4 stars in a typical dsph can be combined with current line - of - sight velocity measurements to constrain the dark halo log - slope to @xmath0 and normalization to @xmath144 at about twice the king radius .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath6 better than currently possible with los velocity dispersion data alone .",
    "the results from such observations will provide a very sensitive test of the cdm paradigm and an incisive tool for investigating the microscopic nature of dark matter .",
    "we estimate that with @xmath3 days of observing time over the 5 year lifetime of sim , it will be possible to obtain the proper motions of @xmath4 stars in multiple dsphs @xcite .",
