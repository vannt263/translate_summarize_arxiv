    "although the global _ total _ energy - momentum is well defined ( for spaces with suitable asymptotic regions ) , for any gravitating system  and hence for all real _ physical _ systems  the localization of energy - momentum is still an outstanding fundamental problem .",
    "@xcite unlike all matter and other interaction fields , the gravitational field itself has _ no _ proper energy - momentum density . in view of the fact that energy - momentum is conserved , and that sources _ exchange _ energy - momentum _ locally _ with the gravitational field , one expects some kind of `` local description '' of the energy - momentum density of gravity itself .",
    "but all attempts at constructing such an expression led only to reference frame dependent quantities , generally referred to as _",
    "pseudotensors_.  @xcite physically this can be understood as a consequence of _ einstein s equivalence principle _ : gravity can not be detected at a point .",
    "the energy - momentum of gravity  and thus for all physical systems is inherently _ non - local_. the modern idea is _ quasi - local _ : energy - momentum is associated with a closed surface bounding a region .",
    "the _ first order _ lagrangian  @xcite for an _ @xmath0-form field @xmath1 _ and its _ conjugate momentum @xmath2 _ is given by @xmath3 the variation ( with respect to @xmath1 and @xmath2 independently ) @xmath4 gives the equations of motion , with @xmath5 , @xmath6 diffeomorphism invariance ( in terms of the lie derivative @xmath7 ) leads an identity for _ any vector @xmath8 _",
    "@xmath9 from this one gets a conserved `` translational current '' 3-form : @xmath10 note that @xmath11 is not unique : @xmath12 furthermore it can be written in the form , @xmath13 then @xmath14 \\equiv d n^\\mu \\wedge { \\cal h}_\\mu + n^\\mu d { \\cal h}_\\mu \\\\ \\rightarrow & & { \\cal h}_\\mu \\ ; \\textrm{vanishes `` on shell''}. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence for gravitating systems the noether translational `` charge ''  _ energy - momentum _  is _ quasi - local _ , it is given by the integral of the boundary term , @xmath15 .",
    "but this boundary term can be completely modified to any value . however , the hamiltonian approach tames the ambiguity .",
    "quasi - local quantities are determined only by the surface integral @xmath16 = \\oint_{\\partial\\sigma } { \\cal b}(n).\\ ] ] the two parts of the hamiltonian have distinct roles : the 3-form part @xmath17 generates the equations of motion . as mentioned , for diffeomorphic invariant theories it has vanishing value .",
    "the hamiltonian generally also includes a boundary term @xmath15 : ( i ) it determines the values of the quasi - local quantities , and ( ii ) it determines the boundary conditions .",
    "@xcite      the hamiltonian boundary terms determines the values of the quasi - local quantities :    * energy is given by a suitable _ timelike _ displacement ; * linear momentum is obtained from a _ spatial _ translation ; * angular momentum from a suitable _ rotational _ displacement ; * a spacetime displacement which is asymptotically a _ boost",
    "_ will give the center - of - mass moment .",
    "our noether analysis has revealed that @xmath15 can be adjusted , changing the conserved value to a new value .",
    "however the variational principle contains an additional ( largely overlooked ) feature which distinguishes all of these choices .",
    "the boundary variation principle , i.e.  the boundary term in the variation , tells us what to hold fixed on the boundary  it determines the _ boundary conditions_.  @xcite    the different hamiltonian boundary terms are each associated with distinct boundary conditions . as in thermodynamics or electrostatics",
    "there are various `` energies '' which correspond to how the system interacts with the outside through its boundary . in general ( in particular for gravity )",
    "it is necessary ( in order to guarantee functional differentiability of the hamiltonian on the phase space with the desired boundary conditions ) to adjust the boundary term @xmath18 which is naturally inherited from the lagrangian  .",
    "the variation of the hamiltonian implies @xmath19 there is a freedom for modifying the boundary term @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , a reference configuration , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , ( which determines the ground state ) is essential especially for gravity , in particular to allow the desired phase space asymptotics .    with @xmath23 , @xmath24 ,",
    "we found two boundary choices ( essentially _ dirichlet _ and _ neumann _ ) which have the indicated covariant boundary terms in @xmath25 : @xmath26 we also found two other physical interesting choices : @xmath27 let us look at the following two applications .",
    "the first order lagrangian 4-form for the source free @xmath28 gauge field one - form @xmath29 and its conjugate momentum @xmath30 is @xmath31 the pair of first order equations are @xmath32 these are just the vacuum maxwell equations with @xmath33 ; hence @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the natural reference in electromagnetism is @xmath36 .",
    "the best boundary choice is @xmath37 , which vanishes for this reference choice .",
    "the first order lagrangian for einstein s ( vacuum ) gravity theory is @xmath38 where the curvature 2-form is @xmath39 , and the dual basis 2-form is @xmath40 . for gravity itself , two different choices of boundary condition",
    "correspond to the quasi - local expressions which asymptotically give ( a ) the adm energy , ( b ) the bondi energy and , moreover , ( c ) the bondi flux : the celebrated outgoing flux plus an incoming flux .",
    "@xcite our general formalism with @xmath41 and @xmath42 gives 4 quasi - local expressions .",
    "there is a distinguished energy expression with a very desirable property : it corresponds to imposing boundary conditions on a _ manifestly covariant object _ : @xmath43 the associated energy flux expression is @xmath44 and the natural reference in gravity for the asymptotic flat spacetime is the minkowski spacetime : @xmath45",
    "now let us turn to how to select the reference ; effectively one should embed the 2-boundary into minkowski space .",
    "@xcite in a neighborhood of the desired spacelike boundary 2-surface @xmath46 , 4 smooth functions @xmath47 with @xmath48 define a minkowski reference : @xmath49 the reference connection is @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 with vanishing minkowski reference connection coefficients .",
    "@xmath53 is a _ translational killing field _ of the minkowski reference , then the second quasi - local term vanishes .",
    "our quasi - local expression then takes the form @xmath54 to determine the reference choice @xmath55 in terms of quasi - spherical foliation adapted coordinates @xmath56 , the isometric matching on the 2-surface implies @xmath57 where the reference metric on the dynamical space has the components @xmath58 . from a classic",
    "closed 2-surface into @xmath59 embedding theorem , we expect that  as long as one restricts @xmath46 and @xmath60 such that on @xmath46 @xmath61 is convex  one can prove that there is a unique isometric embedding .",
    "( but , unfortunately , there is no explicit formula . )",
    "complete 4d isometric matching on @xmath46 has 10 constraints :  @xcite @xmath62 there are 12 embedding functions on the constant @xmath63 2-surface : @xmath64 the 10 constraints split into 3 for the already discussed 2d isometric matching : @xmath65 which constrain the 4 @xmath66 ; 3 normal bundle algebraic quadratic expressions : @xmath67 ; and 4 mixed linear algebraic expressions : @xmath68 .",
    "the 2d isometric matching can be regarded as a given @xmath69 uniquely determining @xmath70 on @xmath46 .",
    "the remaining 7 algebraic equations can be regarded as finding all the other embedding variables in terms of @xmath66 and @xmath71 on @xmath46 .",
    "thus one can take @xmath72 as the embedding control variables .",
    "geometrically @xmath71 controls a boost in the plane normal to @xmath46",
    ".      one can regard the value of the boundary term as a measure of the difference between the dynamical boundary values and the reference boundary values .",
    "however , how to find the `` best matched '' reference geometry ? because 12 embedding variables are subject to 10 isometric conditions , one will obtain the best matched reference geometry as long as one can obtain the two unknown variables .",
    "@xcite    for a given @xmath46 there are 2 different quantities which can be considered : @xmath73 and @xmath74 . for the latter",
    "there are 2 different ways to fix @xmath8 .",
    "the critical points are distinguished : ( 1 ) the critical points of @xmath75 .",
    "this determines the reference up to poincar transformations .",
    "( 2 ) the critical points of @xmath76 .",
    "( if @xmath77 , this may equivalent to ( 1 ) . )",
    "( 3 ) the critical points of @xmath74 for a given dynamical vector field @xmath8 . ( afterward one could find the extreme choice of @xmath8 . )",
    "the first two approaches lead to quasi - local quantities associated with @xmath46 , the third alternative gives a quasi - local energy associated with an observer .",
    "@xcite based on some physical and practical computational arguments , it is reasonable to expect a unique solution . for our quasi - local values for axisymmetric solutions including kerr see ref .  .",
    "for any gravitating system  and hence for all _ physical _ systems  the _ localization _ of energy - momentum is an outstanding problem .",
    "we ve displayed the relation between covariant hamiltonian boundary term and the quasi - local quantities .",
    "for gravitating systems , we have obtained four quasi - local energy - momentum expressions ; each is associated with a physically distinct , and geometrically clear , boundary condition . with",
    "the `` _ _ best matched _ _ '' reference , we have a satisfactory way of fixing the hamiltonian boundary term quasi - locally for locally poincar gauge invariant gravity including gr .",
