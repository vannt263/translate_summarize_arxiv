    "dwarf novae ( dne ) are a class of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , which are close binary systems consisting of a white dwarf and a red - dwarf secondary transferring matter via the roche - lobe overflow .",
    "su uma - type dwarf novae are a class of dne exhibiting superhumps during their long , bright outbursts ( superoutbursts ) , which is believed to be a result of tidal instabilities caused by the 3:1 orbital resonance in the accretion disk [ see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite for basic observational properties ; see @xcite for a theoretical review ] .",
    "wz sge - type dwarf novae ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) are a subgroup of dwarf novae characterized by large - amplitude ( typically @xmath1 8 mag ) superoutbursts with long ( typically @xmath1 10 yr ) recurrence times . although it has been proposed that the properties of outbursts in wz sge - type dwarf novae can be basically understood within the framework of the thermal - tidal disk - instability model ( see e.g. @xcite ) without requiring an enhanced mass - transfer ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , the existence of an enhanced mass - transfer still remains controversial ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "wz sge - type dwarf novae are known to show several unusual properties during outburst , which are rarely seen in ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "they include double - wave early superhumps with periods close to the orbital periods during the early stage of superoutbursts @xcite , which are considered to be a result of 2:1 resonance @xcite .",
    "the frequent existence of post - superoutburst rebrightenings is also characteristic to wz sge - type dwarf novae .",
    "@xcite classified these rebrightening by their morphology ( see also the activity sequence in @xcite ) .",
    "type - a superoutbursts ( long - lasting distinct plateau after the termination of the main superoutburst ) and type - b superoutbursts ( superoutburst followed by distinct multiple rebrightenings ) are unique to wz sge - type dwarf novae . up to now , several objects are known to have shown type - b superoutbursts at least once : uz boo , eg cnc ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , al com @xcite , 1rxs j023238.8@xmath2371812 , asas 153616@xmath20839.1 , ot j074727.6@xmath0065050 ( for a general review on these objects , see kato et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the mechanism of these rebrightening is still in dispute : @xcite suggested that these rebrightenings are produced by an enhanced mass - transfer following the superoutburst while @xcite , @xcite proposed that they can be reproduced if the viscosity in the accretion disk remained higher after the termination of the superoutburst . a search for the observational evidence for the existence of an enhanced mass - transfer is a key in discriminating these possibilities .",
    "wz sge - type dwarf novae have also been shown to exhibit long - lasting superhumps whose periods are longer than the those of superhumps during the superoutburst plateau .",
    "@xcite argued that these superhumps arise from the matter outside the 3:1 resonance , and suggested that the stability of their periods can be understood if the outer edge of the accretion disk is limited by the tidal truncation radius .",

    "for the complex rebrightening phase , we subdivided the light curve into segments of @xmath11-d duration , and subtracted the trend by fitting third order polynomials to individual segments that have sufficient numbers of data points .",
    "we measured the times of superhump maxima by numerically fitting a template superhump light curve around the times of observed maxima .",
    "this fitting methods have been proven to give three times the precision compared to eye estimates we did not use the full superhump cycle but used phases @xmath20.3 to 0.3 in order to pick the features of the hump maxima .",

    "the light curve during these mini - outbursts somewhat resembles the orbital light curve during the rebrightening and final fading phases .",

    "these was an excess component longer than the orbital period , as was seen in the rebrightening and final decline phases .",

    "the basic period was 0.01496(6 ) d , close to the one fourth of the superhump period ( figure [ fig : j0804minipdm ] ) .",
    "the period was different from the 12.6-min periodicity supposed to arise from the pulsation of the white dwarf @xcite .",
    "we regard that superhumps were transiently excited during these mini - outbursts , although it was insufficient to trigger a true outburst .",
    "the brightness increase may be understood as a result of increased tidal dissipation .",
    "based on the presence of eleven rebrightenings , we classified the superoutburst as type - b according to the classification scheme by @xcite .",
    "the apparent absence of flat quiescence between rebrightenings , short ( @xmath1 3 d ) recurrent time of rebrightenings , and the relatively small ( 1.52.0 mag ) amplitudes of rebrightenings might place the superoutburst intermediate between type - a and type - b .    although @xcite argued that the amplitude of the outburst ( up to 5 mag ) is relatively small for a wz sge - type dwarf nova , this is probably because the early stage of the superoutburst was missed .",
    "if the evolution of the superoutburst was similar to that of v455 and , another high - inclination wz sge - type dwarf nova , the true maximum might have reached 11 magnitude .",
    "the high orbital inclination probably partly contributes to the low outburst amplitude .",
    "the overall behavior of superhumps , however , and their @xmath7 , persistent long - period superhumps even after the rebrightening phase , and the low @xmath16 all support the classification of this object as a genuine wz sge - type object .",
    "a detection of early superhumps during future superoutbursts is awaited .",
    "although no 2mass counterpart of this object was detected , we performed quiescent infrared photometry using oao / isle @xcite in 2007 march , about one year after the superoutburst .",
    "the infrared magnitudes were estimated to be @xmath17=17.29(0.05 ) , @xmath18=16.97(0.05 ) and @xmath19=16.41(0.06 ) , respectively .",
    "the resultant color indices ( assuming mean @xmath20=17.1 at this epoch , @xcite ) @xmath21 and @xmath22 are compatible with insignificant contribution in the near - infrared as expected from the small @xmath16 , and consequently , a small mass of the secondary ( cf .",
