    "it has purely imaginary eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors form a complete orthonormal basis .",
    "splitting the trace computation into two parts , the trace over the nonzero eigenvalues can be done easily as follows . since @xmath53 , for every eigenvector @xmath54 with nonzero eigenvalue @xmath55",

    "we also computed the susceptibility using the wilson fermions and compared the results with those above .",

    "( [ eqn : wilopmu ] ) , we make a proposal valid for all fermions .",
    "because of the infamous sign / phase problem for the fermion determinant with nonzero chemical potential , it has been proposed to look for the qcd critical point @xcite by looking for the radius of convergence of the taylor expansion @xcite in @xmath0 of the baryonic susceptibility .",
    "computations have been done up to the eighth order so far @xcite . extending these calculations to higher",
    "order is both necessary and desirable to confirm the results already obtained .",
    "our proposal can permit such an endeavor .",
    "we denote @xmath175 ) to be any generic lattice fermionic operator with the chemical potential @xmath0 :    @xmath176    here @xmath177 can be the staggered , overlap , wilson - dirac or any other suitable fermion operator , and @xmath178 is the corresponding point - split and gauge invariant number density .",
    "( [ eqn : wilopmu ] ) provides a concrete example of the above for the overlap fermions .",
    "note that any improvements in the fermion operator @xmath177 or the number density @xmath179 are generically included as long as the classical continuum limit is the same and @xmath0 appears linearly .",
    "it is easy to see that only the first derivative of @xmath110 with @xmath0 is nonzero .",
    "all others are zero . thus denoting by @xmath180 the first derivative of @xmath110 with respect to @xmath0 and adding more primes in the superscript for successively higher orders , @xmath181 for our proposal to incorporate @xmath0 in contrast to the popular exp(@xmath182 ) prescription where _ all _ derivatives are nonzero : @xmath183    as a consequence , the various nonlinear susceptibility expressions , or equivalently the expressions for taylor series coefficients , are a lot simpler and have a lot fewer terms .",
    "for example , let us write down a fourth - order coefficient [ by combining eqs .",
    "( a.4 ) , ( a.7 ) , and ( a.8 ) of @xcite ] : @xmath184.\\ ] ] here the notation @xmath185 stands for the product , @xmath186 .",
    "the expressions for @xmath187 , @xmath188=1,4 for our proposal above are @xmath189    in contrast with those for the usual case given in @xcite : @xmath190 the eighth - order term needs @xmath191 , which has 18 terms in the usual case whereas it will simply be @xmath192 for our proposal .    the number of matrix inversions required to compute the higher order susceptibilities",
    "is also drastically reduced in this way of incorporating the chemical potential .",
    "this would save a considerable amount of computer time , as matrix inversions are the most time intensive operations .",
    "following fig . 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite , one can see that all computations referred to on the leftmost branch of the algorithm tree need to be performed when @xmath110 has a linear @xmath0 dependence .",
    "thus for the eighth - order susceptibility computation we need to compute only eight matrix inversions as compared to the 20 required there , saving 60% of the computer time . for higher order susceptibilities ,",
    "the number of matrix inversions is reduced by at least half , enabling us to compute even higher orders of the taylor series of thermodynamic quantities and thus constrain the radius of convergence and the estimated location of the critical point better .",
    "of course , there is a price to pay , and we hope to demonstrate in the future from our ongoing work that it is not very big .",
    "all the coefficients that one evaluates this way will have the remnants of the terms which are otherwise eliminated by the usual prescriptions @xcite . based on our computations in the previous section , we suggest that the zero temperature contribution to each of them be subtracted by evaluating them on a symmetric @xmath193 lattice at the same @xmath194 as the finite temperature computation on the @xmath195 lattice . since the second - order susceptibility @xmath196 has a divergence in the continuum limit",
    ", its computations may need higher precision to ensure the absence of the cut - off effects but the higher order coefficients have no such difficulties .",
    "one will also have to rescale the fourth - order susceptibility by a factor of 1.25 in order to use it in the ratio or the root method of estimating the radius of convergence .",
    "we hope that tenth- or even twelfth - order coefficient may thus be computable .",
    "we have shown perturbatively from the computation of the triangle diagram at zero temperature that the anomaly equation does not have any finite density correction terms .",
    "we have extended our calculations to the nonperturbative case where we have used fujikawa s method to show that the anomaly relation is unaffected in the presence of a finite chemical potential .",
    "this has an important implication for the lattice field theory in designing the lattice dirac operator for nonzero @xmath0 : it should lead to a @xmath0-independent anomaly relation on the lattice .",
    "the recent bloch - wettig proposal for chiral fermion operators at finite density violates the chiral invariance on the lattice itself .",
    "while a @xmath0-dependent modification of the chiral transformation can restore the chiral invariance , it leads to a @xmath0-dependent anomaly relation unlike in the continuum theory .",
    "such a modification has other physical consequences discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have proposed a physically more justified way of introducing @xmath0 in the overlap dirac operator . in this method",
    "the chiral symmetry is explicitly broken as well , but the contribution to the anomaly relation from the measure is likely to remain @xmath0 independent , with the lattice corrections to the anomaly relation falling off as a power law in the continuum limit .",
    "it has the expected @xmath144-type divergences in the continuum limit .",
    "we showed how a simple subtraction scheme can take care of them in the free case .",
    "we proposed to use the simple linear in @xmath0 form for the taylor series expansion technique of locating the qcd critical point .",
    "it has the advantage that the number of fermion matrix inversions goes down drastically when computing the higher order quark number susceptibilities .",
    "the higher order susceptibility computations are clearly important to accurately locate the critical point in the @xmath197-@xmath198 phase space for qcd .",
    "our proposal would save much of the computational effort required for obtaining higher order susceptibilities , even for the staggered fermions .",
