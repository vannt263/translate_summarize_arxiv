    "a quantum system is referred to as controllable if it can be transferred from an arbitrary state to another through engineering the dynamics . as a fundamental aspect of quantum control theory ,",
    "controllability has been widely studied for various types of systems including infinite - dimensional@xcite and finite - dimensional@xcite closed systems and markovian open systems@xcite .",
    "however , the practical necessity for controllability is still unclear as it may not be required in many realistic applications and may not always be available .",
    "for example , the goal of realizing only a specific unitary transformation related to achieving a quantum computation algorithm , or reaching particular excited states of a molecule generally do not require full controllability .",
    "no apparent advantage can be seen by merely gaining additional controllability .",
    "the study of this issue is also motivated by the growing number of successful adaptive control experiments utilizing shaped laser pulses as the controls @xcite . in most of these systems , there is no assessment of controllability and a simple yes - or - no controllability answer , likely has little practical relevance .",
    "here we study this matter in the framework of the quantum control landscape @xcite , which was developed for understanding the complexity of optimizing quantum dynamics @xcite .",
    "a quantum control landscape is formally defined as a target functional , @xmath2 $ ] , to be maximized ( minimized ) over the set of implementable control fields @xmath3 that steer the following @xmath4-level quantum control system : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the system propagator at time @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the internal hamiltonian and @xmath9 are the control hamiltonians .",
    "a major goal of quantum control landscape theory is performance of a topological analysis of the critical points ( i.e. , the critical topology ) from which insights can be gained about the complexity of optimizing quantum system dynamics .",
    "consider the class of control landscapes in the form of @xmath10 , where the system propagator @xmath11 at @xmath12 is an implicit functional of the control field through the schrdinger equation ( [ quantum control system ] ) .",
    "the control landscape can be displayed either on the space of the control fields ( i.e. , in the dynamical picture ) or on the set of realizable propagators @xmath11 ( i.e. , in the kinematic picture ) . in prior studies",
    "@xcite , we have shown that the main topological characteristics of the critical points in the dynamical picture are preserved when mapped onto the critical points in the kinematic picture except for what appear to uncommon singularity issues .",
    "thus , almost all maxima , minima and saddle points in the dynamical picture should correspond to the same type of critical points in the easier to analyze kinematic picture without distortion of the topological features .",
    "the kinematic control landscape may be constructed from the ( low - dimensional ) set of realizable propagators . if the system is controllable , then the set of realizable propagators form the unitary group .",
    "this circumstance has been studied for practical optimization objectives ( e.g. , the state transfer probability @xcite , ensemble average @xcite and gate fidelity @xcite ) , which collectively show that none of these landscapes possess local suboptima that may impede the search for the ultimate global optima .",
    "this behavior provides a basis to explain the large and growing body of experimental quantum control successes , although in the laboratory many ancillary issues and constraints may be present .",
    "realistic quantum systems may not be always fully manipulable .",
    "a typical circumstance is when the system is under some dynamic symmetry that restricts the system s evolution .",
    "even if the system is not subject to a dynamic symmetry , the restrictions on available control resources ( e.g. , the amplitude , bandwidth and center frequency of the applied field ) can still cause a practical loss of full controllability , in which case movement over the landscape when searching for an optimal control can become limited on the otherwise trap free landscape . whether these uncontrollable systems still have",
    "a physically attractive landscape topology becomes practically important for assessing the complexity of searching for optimal controls , which is explored in this paper .",
    "the loss of controllability poses restrictions on the set of reachable states , which impacts the kinematic analysis .",
    "the set of reachable states for control - restricted systems is generally very complex to identify , while that for systems with dynamic symmetry may be simply revealed ( e.g. , as a lie subgroup of @xmath13 ) .",
    "the landscape topology for systems with dynamic symmetry has been identified for gate fidelity under certain special symmetries @xcite , where no false traps were observed . however , as will be seen in this paper , false traps ( i.e. , yet appearing as real in practice ) can occur in the landscape of symmetry induced uncontrollable quantum systems .",
    "the paper will be organized as follows .",
    "section ii discusses the general conditions for the existence of critical points on such landscapes .",
    "section iii analyzes the case of the fidelity control landscape of transformations with @xmath14 dynamic symmetry , where for @xmath15 or @xmath16 we derive the analytic structure for simple cases and graphically compare the landscapes for different symmetry types .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section iv .",
    "let @xmath17 be the lie algebra spanned by @xmath18 , then the quantum propagator must evolve within the lie group @xmath19 generated by @xmath17 , which forms the dynamic symmetry of the system . if @xmath17 forms a proper lie subalgebra of @xmath20 , the system must be uncontrollable .",
    "however , owing to the compactness of the unitary group , the set of realizable propagators can fill up the group @xmath21 if the control is not limited and the evolution time is sufficiently long .",
    "hence , in a kinematic analysis , one can suitably study the landscape of symmetry induced uncontrollable quantum systems on the corresponding symmetry group .    the condition for @xmath22 to be a landscape critical point",
    "can be derived through parameterizing its neighborhood in @xmath21 as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 represents the local coordinates .",
    "the variation of the landscape function with respect to @xmath25 can then be written via the chain rule @xmath26where @xmath27 is the gradient function over @xmath13 and the matrix inner product @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath29 , then the condition for @xmath22 to be critical is that @xmath30 which requires that the vector @xmath31 be orthogonal to the subspace @xmath17 .",
    "for example , @xmath32 $ ] corresponds to the ensemble control landscape @xmath33 and @xmath34 corresponds to the gate fidelity control landscape @xmath35 .",
    "the set of critical points with @xmath21 dynamic symmetry can then be expressed as @xmath36    the condition ( [ projection ] ) provides a clear geometric picture for the critical points , however , it is difficult to use for directly determining the critical topology with an arbitrary dynamic symmetry , except in the extreme case that the system is controllable ( i.e. , @xmath37 ) , where the condition can be simplified to @xmath38 on @xmath13 .",
    "it is also possible , as will be shown below , to simplify the analysis by making use of the symmetric form of the landscape function , from which we can either solve for the critical topology or easily visualize it for low dimensional symmetries .",
    "the quantum gate fidelity landscape is defined as @xmath39 where @xmath4 is the dimension of the system and @xmath40 is the target unitary transformation . in eq .",
    "[ w ] is still trap - free for controllable systems @xcite . ]",
    "if the target transformation @xmath41 is realizable , i.e. , @xmath42 , then we can use the transformation @xmath43 to change the landscape function into a canonical form @xmath44 .    from group representation theory ,",
    "a dynamic symmetry group @xmath45 can be taken as a @xmath4-dimensional unitary representation of the abstract lie group @xmath21 , which thereby can be decomposed into smaller unitary irreducible representations ( uir ) , i.e. , one can always find a constant unitary similarity transformation in @xmath21 that turns each @xmath46 into a block diagonal form : @xmath47where @xmath48 , and each sub - block @xmath49 can not be decomposed into smaller ones .",
    "for the gate fidelity control landscape , the landscape function with @xmath21 carrying a reducible representation can be written as the sum of the landscape function values evaluated on its irreducible components .",
    "hence , it is convenient to start with the case that @xmath21 is a unitary irreducible representation of some abstract lie group in @xmath13 .    a classification scheme of uncontrollable systems was proposed @xcite based on the lie algebra @xmath17 and their unitary irreducible representations ( uir ) .",
    "here we only consider the class of @xmath14 dynamic symmetry ( i.e. , the group of @xmath50 unit trace unitary matrices ) .",
    "for example , the @xmath51 dynamic symmetry may arise when the free and control hamiltonians of spin-@xmath52 particles ( or a rigid rotor whose angular momentum is @xmath53 ) in a magnetic field are a linear combination of the spin operators @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 that possess an @xmath57 dimensional uir ( denoted by @xmath58 ) .",
    "similarly , two non - interacting spin particles with spin-@xmath59 and spin-@xmath60 in a magnetic field ( e.g. , two electrons in a multi - electron molecular system ) possess a tensor product of @xmath51 uirs @xmath61 , which can be decomposed into the direct sum of smaller uirs of @xmath51 .",
    "suppose that @xmath21 carries an @xmath4-dimensional uir of @xmath14 , then there must be a homeomorphic mapping @xmath62 that transforms any unitary matrix @xmath63 to an @xmath50 unitary matrix @xmath64 such that @xmath65 .",
    "let the complex numbers @xmath66 be the eigenvalues of @xmath67 corresponding to @xmath68 , which satisfy @xmath69 , then according to the well - known weyl formula @xcite , the uirs of @xmath14 are labeled by a group of integers @xmath70 @xcite , and the trace of @xmath68 can be expressed as the following character function @xmath71 where @xmath72this formula shows that the original landscape function on an @xmath73-dimensional group manifold @xmath21 can be reduced to a function of @xmath74 independent variables @xmath75 on the @xmath76-tori @xmath77 , thereby all @xmath46 corresponding to a critical point @xmath78 form a subset of the critical submanifold with the same @xmath79 value .    as a direct application of the above formula , the case of @xmath51 can be computed .",
    "suppose that @xmath21 carries a uir @xmath80 of @xmath51 , then the landscape function is @xmath81according to ( [ xi ] ) .",
    "let @xmath82 and @xmath83 , where @xmath84 , then ( [ su2e1e2 ] ) can be reduced to a single variable function @xmath85}{(2j+1)\\sin\\beta}\\big|,\\]]whose critical points @xmath86 characterize the critical topology .",
    "besides @xmath51 , the @xmath87 case is relatively simple , but a universal solution is still not available for the critical topology of all its uirs .",
    "however , as the corresponding character formula involves only two independent variables , it is possible to solve for the critical topology of low dimensional uirs , and , numerically , it is easy to visualize the landscape in a 3d image for any individual uir ( labeled by two integers @xmath88 ) .",
    "the dimension of the @xmath89 uir is given by @xmath90 . in the following",
    ", we will use @xmath51 and @xmath87 examples to study the impact of the symmetry group , the uir dimensionality and the influence of realizability of the target gate upon the landscape topology .",
    "the case @xmath14 for @xmath91 will not be discussed in this paper .",
    "consider the @xmath51 case with @xmath41 being realizable .",
    "1 shows two examples with @xmath92 and @xmath93 for @xmath94 $ ] ( the remaining part @xmath95 $ ] is repeating and thus omitted ) according to the formula ( [ j(beta ) ] ) , respectively , corresponding to dimensions @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "both landscapes possess four local maxima , and their local minima are all of value zero .",
    "no saddle points are found .",
    "there are three traps on the landscape , and the results obtained from the two examples can be generalized as below :    denote @xmath98 as the largest integer that is no greater than @xmath52 .",
    "the control landscape @xmath99 has @xmath100 local suboptima .",
    "the systems that carry higher - dimensional uirs ( i.e. , with a larger @xmath52 in @xmath58 ) are less controllable because the number of degrees of freedom is always 3 ( versus the total number @xmath101 in @xmath102 ) .",
    "thus , we can see from the theorem that the search for an optimal control is more likely to be trapped on such landscapes because there tends to be a larger of number of traps .",
    "moreover , the convergence region of the global optimum @xmath103 can be identified as @xmath104 $ ] according to ( [ j(beta ) ] ) , which also shrinks when @xmath52 increases , leaving the system more likely to be trapped by some of the @xmath105 local suboptima outside the region .",
    "therefore , the loss of controllability leads to an increase of the ruggedness of the landscape .     and @xmath106 uirs.,width=288,height=192 ]",
    "consider again the dynamic symmetry @xmath51 .",
    "if the target gate is not realizable , i.e. , @xmath107 , then the dynamic symmetry group @xmath21 is not invariant under the transformation @xmath108 , and hence the approach used above for realizable @xmath41 is no longer applicable . in this case , the landscape function can not be reduced to having a single characterizing parameter , and we have to analyze it on the original three - dimensional group manifold . here",
    "we adopt the well - know euler decomposition @xmath109 which parameterizes the landscape function by @xmath110 . to facilitate visualization of the results , we consider the special case that the target gate @xmath41 commutates with @xmath111 , i.e. , @xmath112=0 $ ] , for which the landscape function reduces to the following two - variable form : @xmath113where @xmath114 .",
    "for example , suppose that @xmath111 is diagonal under some chosen uir basis , then the landscape function can be reduced to a two - variable function if the target gate is a diagonal @xmath4-dimensional unitary matrix , whose diagonal elements affect the landscape topology .",
    "for such a class of unrealizable target gates , one can easily depict the two - dimensional landscape topology as exemplified in fig.[d4d5 ] . compared to the case of a realizable @xmath41 , the landscape hight ( i.e. , the maximal fidelity ) decreases to @xmath115 due to the inability of perfectly realizing the gate @xmath41 .",
    "in addition , the landscape with realizable @xmath41 possesses three critical submanifolds ( owing to the intrinsic dependence upon a single variable ) , while the landscape with an unreachable @xmath41 is much more rugged , implying that having an unattainable target state not only degrades the maximal achievable fidelity but also increases the complexity of the landscape topology .",
    "consequently , local search algorithms ( e.g. , gradient based methods ) on such a control landscape likely will be less effective .     with ( a ) @xmath116 ; ( b ) @xmath117.,width=480,height=240 ]      to compare the influence of different dynamic symmetry groups , we choose the @xmath118 and @xmath119 uirs of @xmath87 and the uir @xmath120 of @xmath51 , whose dimensions are all fifteen ( i.e. , corresponding to different dynamic symmetries in the same physical system ) .",
    "we directly show the 3d landscape profiles in fig .",
    "the landscape topology is less rugged for the @xmath87 case , as all critical points are isolated .",
    "moreover , the region of attraction for the global maximum is rather large , while that of the @xmath51 symmetry is small , making its peak very sharp .",
    "this shows from another perspective that the enhanced controllability ( corresponding to a larger dynamic symmetry group ) helps to improve the search efficiency for global optimal controls by smoothing the landscape topology .",
    "it is also interesting that the landscapes of different uirs of the @xmath87 symmetry group can be distinct ( i.e. , the uir @xmath118 landscape is less rugged ) even when their dimensions are identical .",
    "-dimensional systems under @xmath51 and @xmath87 dynamic symmetries : ( a ) the landscape with @xmath51 symmetry with uir @xmath120 ; ( b ) the landscape with @xmath87 symmetry with uir labeled by @xmath119 ; ( c ) the landscape with @xmath87 symmetry with uir labeled by @xmath118 .",
    "their landscape ruggedness is in decreasing order.,width=480,height=480 ]",
    "the present study on the landscape of uncontrollable systems with @xmath51 and @xmath87 dynamic symmetries show that controllability plays an important role in maximizing unitary gate fidelity , whether or not the desired target is attainable .",
    "the loss of controllability can lead to false traps over the corresponding restricted kinematic control landscape on the dynamic symmetry group .",
    "the ruggedness generally increases when controllability is weakened , i.e. , either with a smaller dynamic symmetry group or an unattainable target unitary transformation , making the search for global optimal controls much more difficult .",
    "the details of the landscape topology depend on the particular structure of the dynamic symmetry group and the unitary representation it carries ( see @xcite for a classification of such systems ) .",
    "uncontrollable systems with dynamic symmetry generally possess rugged control landscapes , but this may not always be the case .",
    "for example , the gate fidelity landscape with @xmath41 realizable and the following reachable sets in @xmath13 were found ( or can be easily proved ) to be devoid of local suboptima :      the landscape structure for the observable control problem @xcite also becomes rugged when the system is under dynamic symmetry .",
    "the corresponding the critical topology structure is dependent on the spectra of the system density matrix and the observable , and will be more complicated than the case of unitary fidelity landscape",
    ". this important problem will be explored in future studies ."
