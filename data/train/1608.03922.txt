    "also it is used for the study of microphysical process in clouds and for climate modeling @xcite .    the need for more accurate theoretical models to simulate clouds",
    "has increased the requirement of more detailed measurements of relationships between the settling velocity , masses , and dimensions for a large spectrum of ice crystal types .",
    "a precise determination of these relationships allow us to obtain accurate parameterizations of the settling velocity of cloud particles .",
    "these parametrizations are essential to have an accurate simulation of cloud in general circulation models ( gcms ) of precipitation amount , cloud dissipation and cloud optical properties @xcite .",
    "although there have been many proposals in literature , the ice crystal sedimentation in the atmosphere has not been completely characterized @xcite .",
    "there are analytical solutions that precisely determine the sedimentation falling velocity for spheres particles . due to the large variety of shapes , sizes and masses of ice crystals , and the range of reynolds numbers involved in these problems , there is no precise analytical estimation to predict the falling velocity for shapes other than spheres .",
    "many works in literature @xcite provide schemes to parameterize the ice crystal masses , shapes and size to predict the settling velocity .",

    "the proposals by @xcite have shown quite good approximations to the falling speed of ice particles for @xmath3 .",
    "these proposals proved to be in good agreement with experimental data for a variety of particle types .",
    "however @xcite showed that for viscous flow regimes ( @xmath4 ) these formulations overestimate the crystal falling velocity .",

    "the sedimentation of an ice crystal in the atmosphere is a fluid mechanical problem that can be modeled as a rigid body moving immersed in a fluid flow .",
    "this rigid body moves under the action of its own weight , buoyancy force and interacting with others crystals and with the fluid that surrounds it .    given a characterization for the shape , size and mass density of the crystals , together with its atmospheric habitat",
    ", it is possible to completely determine the dynamical behavior of the crystals by using some adequate computational fluid dynamic ( cfd ) method .",
    "having an accurate numerical method to solve these problems allows us in turn to test and to improve the parametrization laws , and to compute the settling velocities for sizes , shapes and masses for which experimental data are not available .",

    "the behavior of particles in sedimentation have been analyzed using lbm in a variety of problems @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use lbm to study the dynamical behavior of ice crystals with two different shapes : simple columns and six bullet policrystal ( a combination of columns or bullets ) .",
    "in particular , the ice crystal settling velocity is obtained numerically for both shapes in a range of masses and sizes ( characteristic lengths of @xmath6 ) .",
    "the lbm results for the fluid mechanical problems are obtained in a pure viscous regime ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "this is the flow regime of the smallest particles falling in a cloud .",
    "the accuracy in the lbm to treat this problem is evaluated by comparison with some well known experimental data in literature @xcite , and with theoretical proposal from @xcite and @xcite .    in order to prove the correctness and accuracy of the proposed lbm algorithm , two fluid mechanical problems at low reynolds number",
    "were tested .",
    "the idea of these benchmarks is to test our algorithm in translational and rotational problems , within the @xmath1 regime that include the ice crystal sedimentation problems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : lbm ] we present the basic equations of the lbm , introduce notation and some details about the boundary conditions methods , force evaluation , and grid refinement techniques . in section [ sec : lbm_benchmarks ] we evaluate the correctness of the proposed lbm algorithm to solve two benchmarks , _ sphere sedimentation in a square duct _",

    "in addition to the lattice boltzmann equation that govern the physics of the bulk fluid ; one needs to prescribe a method to apply boundary conditions , to evaluate the fluid force on a body and to implement grid refinement where necessary . in the next sections we briefly review these topics .",

    "specific values of @xmath34 s and @xmath35 s , @xmath36 are made so that these quadratures give exact results for the @xmath9-moments of order 0 , 1 and 2 @xcite .",

    "the problems we are interested in are those in which rigid bodies move inside an unbounded fluid domain . because the impossibility to model an infinite fluid domain",
    ", we have to restrict the problem to a finite computational fluid domain .",
    "the size of the computational fluid domain has to be a compromise between minimizing the computational work ",
    "the smaller the size the better , and minimizing the undesirable effect of the boundary conditions  the larger the domain the better .    the computational fluid domain is a block of fluid bounded by regular borders .",
    "the rigid bodies that move inside the domain are described by geometries as required .",
    "the flow in the interior of the domain is computed by solving the lbe .",
    "close to the boundaries a special treatment is used so that the flow obeys the physical boundary conditions . in the present work ,",
    "we use both dirichlet and outflow open - boundary conditions ( convective boundary conditions or sommerfeld like ) . the correct imposition of the boundary conditions on arbitrary boundary geometries , like the boundary of rigid bodies , has been one of the main issues in lbm .    to impose dirichlet boundary conditions , for the velocity or pressure , on a regular boundary which is coincident with the grid ,",
    "we use the method proposed in @xcite .",
    "these regular boundaries are adequately represented by linked lattice nodes . to impose dirichlet conditions for the velocity on boundaries of arbitrary shape we use the method proposed by @xcite .",
    "we also use the method shown in @xcite and obtain no significant differences in the results .    in order to reduce the length of the numerical flow domain",
    "we apply a convective , or sommerfeld like , boundary conditions on the open boundaries of the domain .",
    "these boundary conditions allow us to model a long or quasi - infinite physical domain with a reduced computational domain .",
    "these type of conditions have been extensively applied in computational fluid mechanics .",
    "we make a particular implementation of convective boundary condition in the lbm context .",
    "more details about our implementation are given in section [ subsec : lbm_cbc ] .",
    "the outflow open - boundary conditions allow us to represent a long or quasi - infinite physical domain by a finite computational domain .    in many fluid mechanical problems on a large , quasi - infinite fluid domain ,",
    "the region in which the velocity gradients , viscosity and inertial forces are significant is rather small .",
    "it is a challenge to adequately represent such a fluid mechanical problem on a bounded , as small as possible , computational domain in such a way that the interesting physics is captured accurately and at the same time the computational cost is reduced significantly .",
    "strictly speaking , one needs to apply convenient boundary conditions at the finitely close computational boundaries so that these conditions do not affect the physical behavior of the flow in the interior or ruin the intrinsic lbm accuracy .",
    "there are different approaches in the literature to treat the outflow open - boundary conditions in the lbm context .",
    "we can divide these approaches in at least two categories , the ones based on mesoscopic variables @xcite and the ones based on macroscopic variables @xcite .",
    "the latter are generally extensions of boundary conditions extensively applied in classical methods ( finite difference ( _ fd _ ) , finite volume ( _ fv _ ) and finite element ( _ fe _ ) methods ) of computational fluid mechanics ( _ cfd _ ) to solve the navier - stokes ( _ ns _ ) equations .",
    "we are mainly interested in non - stationary quasi - incompressible problems . in the lbm context",
    "the convective boundary condition ( cbc ) proposed in @xcite to treat outflow open - boundaries has shown acceptable results in these kind of problems .",
    "also , in @xcite it is shown that cbc gives better results than neumann boundary conditions ( _ nbc _ ) when using fv methods to solve the incompressible ns equation .",
    "the nbc are based on macroscopic variables , and were also tested in lbm @xcite .",
    "the results presented in @xcite show that cbc are a better option than nbc in non - stationary problems .",
    "these works show that nbc introduce undesirable perturbations in the fluid domain , specially in non - stationary problems .    in our numerical tests we use cbc to fix the velocity in the outflow open - boundaries .",
    "to complete the cbc method we use some dirichlet boundary condition method to fix the unknown mesoscopic ( @xmath50 ) variables that have to satisfy the macroscopic cbc .",
    "the cbc is defined as : @xmath51\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is a velocity or pressure function , and @xmath53 is a reference velocity that have to be defined adequately .",
    "@xmath54 is the boundary of the fluid domain @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is the outward normal vector in @xmath54 . in our numerical implementation cbc are applied on straight , grid - coincident boundaries only .    to show the implementation of the cbc , we consider as an example a boundary with normal vector @xmath57 .",
    "given the lbe solution at time @xmath16 [ eq : cbcgeneral ] gives , for @xmath58 @xmath59 where we have approximated the space derivative by a second order accurate , backward difference operator and the time derivative by a first order accurate , forward difference operator .",
    "from equation [ eq : u_incbcborder ] the velocity @xmath60 that satisfy the cbc can be determined .",
    "knowing the boundary velocity at @xmath45 some dirichlet boundary condition can be used to determine the corresponding mesoscopic variables .",
    "we implement the cbc method coupled with the proposal of @xcite to impose the boundary velocity determined from equation [ eq : u_incbcborder ] .",
    "equation [ eq : u_incbcborder ] is incomplete until we provide a prescription for the value of @xmath61 .",
    "various criteria can be found in the literature to do this .",
    "@xcite sets this quantity equal to the mean velocity on the outflow open convective boundary .",
    "@xcite sets @xmath53 equal to the upstream free velocity @xmath62 with some additional conditions to ensure mass conservation in the fluid domain .",
    "mass conservation problems are also observed in the case of @xcite .",
    "in our implementation we set @xmath53 as a constant : the upstream mean velocity .",
    "we have observed , by performing typical benchmark tests , that mass is acceptably conserved by the resulting scheme .",
    "it is of crucial importance , in many applications that involve moving bodies surrounded by a fluid flow , to have a good method or algorithm to compute the flow force and torque acting on the bodies . by good we mean a method that is simple to apply , that is accurate and fast , so as not to spoil the efficiency of the flow computing method .",
    "the accuracy in the determination of the force and torque acting on a moving body directly affects the body s movement . for a review of lbm methods that involve flow force evaluation on suspended particles we refer to section 6 of @xcite and references therein .    the classical way to compute forces , and",
    "so torque , on submerged bodies is via the computation and integration of the stress tensor on the surface of the body . in lbm",
    "the stress tensor is a local variable , its computation and extrapolation from the lattice to the surface is computationally expensive , which ruins the efficiency of the lbm .",
    "however , this method is widely used in lbm @xcite .    an standard method to evaluate forces on submerged bodies in lbm is the _ momentum exchange _ ( _ me _ ) , introduced firstly by @xcite in lbm applications . the me algorithm is specifically designed and adapted to lbm",
    "; it is therefore more efficient than stress integration from the computational point of view .",
    "some improvements to ladd proposal have been introduced in @xcite , and different approaches to improve the methods in problems with moving bodies were made @xcite . in this work ,",
    "force and torque are evaluated by using the methods presented in @xcite .",
    "the motion of each body is determined by solving the newton s equations of motion with rotations formulated using quaternions @xcite .",
    "the forces acting over bodies are given by the fluid flow forces , weight and buoyancy forces .",
    "to integrate in time we use euler forward numerical scheme , which is first order accurate as the lbm method itself .",
    "many problems in fluid mechanics are such that big gradients of the fluid variables appear only in regions which are small as compared with the whole computational domain .",
    "to resolve well the space variations of the fluid variables one needs a grid size which is small enough .    in lbm",
    "a simple lattice is a cartesian grid of equispaced nodes .",
    "the distance between two nearest neighbor nodes , the grid size , is @xmath63 for a real problem , the computational domain is covered by an arrangement of grids",
    ". this arrangement can be as simple as a unique lattice  or block grid  with a single size @xmath25 , or a complex arrangement of grids with different grid sizes .    in a problem with more or less uniform space variations all over , a single block grid that covers the whole computational domain may be suitable . in a problem where high space variations occur in a small region , a small grid size needs to be used in that region . but using this small grid size on the whole computational domain would be a waste of computational effort .",
    "the right thing to do is to use an arrangement of grids with different grid sizes .",
    "the methods to integrate various grid blocks with different grid sizes into a single computational domain are known as grid refinement methods .    in lbm",
    "there are at least two grid refinement methods : _ multi - grid method _ ( mg ) @xcite and _ multi - domain method _",
    "( md ) ( or multi - block ) @xcite . in the mg method , a grid block with small grid size is always superimposed to a grid block with larger grid size .",
    "several layers of grids can be superimposed in this way . in md method",
    "the grids with different grid sizes overlap just in a selected set of lattice nodes .",
    "this overlapping occurs only on a small region with two adjacent grid blocks of different grid sizes , see @xcite .    in this work",
    "we use md methods .",
    "we select this method because it has better numerical performance and lesser memory requirement than mg method .",
    "a disadvantage of the md method , though , is that its implementation is more complex than that of mg where some additional grids are used as interface to interchange data between different levels of grid size .",
    "we use a priori refinement method .",
    "this means that we chose the arrangement of refined grids in the domain before solving the fluid problem , and this arrangement is fixed in time .",
    "this last characteristic becomes the main numerical performance limitation of our method . in non - stationary fluid problems the smallest scales to solve and",
    "its position within the fluid domain are not easy to predict .",
    "a priori refinement methods are not the most efficient option in non - stationary fluid problems , one frequently needs to implement _ adaptive refinement methods _ @xcite .",
    "this adaptive methods are able to change the refined grids arrangement at run time .",
    "in this section we show lbm results for two fluid mechanical problems well known in the literature . our purpose is to test the correctness of the proposed lbm algorithm to solve problems at low reynolds numbers as those in ice crystals sedimentation .",
    "the rigid body equations of movement are independently solved for translations and rotations , they are only coupled through the fluid forces .",
    "therefore we chose two particular problems , with well known results , to test pure translations and pure rotations .",
    "we are interested in the problem of an sphere sedimenting inside a square section duct full of a viscous fluid .",
    "we are particularly interested in the determination of the sphere s terminal falling velocity @xmath64 in figure [ fig : schematicfallingsphereandresults]@xmath65 we show a scheme of the problem configuration .",
    "we compute @xmath66 for different values of the relation @xmath67 between the sphere s diameter @xmath68 and the length @xmath69 of the square cross section .",
    "we are looking for the relation @xmath70 , as a function of @xmath67 , where @xmath71 is the sphere s terminal falling velocity in an unbounded fluid domain .",
    "the ratio @xmath70 is commonly named _",
    "wall correction factor_.    the terminal falling velocity is the stationary velocity that a body ( sphere ) reaches in a sedimentation process ; the body and viscous forces are equal in magnitude in this stationary regime .",

    ", being the rigid body at an approximately constant position , relative to the computational fluid domain , reduces the region of refinement and simplifies the refinement algorithm , since we can keep the refinement region fixed ( no dynamical refinement process is necessary ) . on the other hand , the constant velocity fluid domain with adequate boundary conditions allows us to reduce the length of the domain .",
