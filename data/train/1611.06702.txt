    ", we used their candidate sources of class i and ii .",
    "figure [ fig:13]a shows the plot of distribution of the ysos . as their field is not fully covered our mapping area of 3  observations , we supplemented by the spitzer yso catalog ( catalog 1 ) of @xcite . that is why the surface density of class ii sources in the southern region appears to be low .",
    "a rich clustering of class 0/i objects is seen along  and in the core region , where the southern - maser source and 3  peak lie .",
    "although in the spitzer catalog 1 clusterings are not found around the positions of two iras sources because of confusion by the bright infrared nebulosities , the deep nir observations by @xcite clearly revealed some peaks of the yso surface density associated with  and its surroundings .",

    "the peak of yso surface distribution at the south of iras02244@xmath16117 is also evident . as the northern part of",
    "is located between these two iras sources , @xcite suggested the star formation activity of  has been induced by these two sources .",
    "the substructure of   could be affected by the feedback from the young stellar activities .",
    "sfo05 at the northern end of  is the typical case of star formation triggered by radiation - driven implosion .",
    "a pre - existing condensation of about @xmath121 was compressed by the pressure of the ionizing radiation of w4 @xcite . and",
    "the compact  region g134.2 + 0.8 lies at the interface between the  and w4 .",
    "this implies that the b0.5 star exciting the  region g134.2 + 0.8 @xcite could have been formed due to the influence of the expanding bubble of w4 .",
    "the large - scale temperature enhancement in the eastern side of the  suggests an interaction between the dense ridge and the w4 bubble .",
    "the interaction with the compact  region may be limited to only the periphery or the north - south direction where large velocity widths were observed .",
    "the low ionizing flux can erode the cloud , but would not trigger the formation of stars @xcite .",
    "previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) support a triggered or induced mode of star formation to be responsible for the formation of the stars at the interface between the w4 and the dense cloud , .",
    "we suggest the overall structure of  has been made by the external feedback from w4 .",
    "although the local stellar feedback was also acting to make small - scale structure of the cloud , the convergent constructive process @xcite did not work effectively in this region .",
    "quiescent mode of star formation can be described as a mode of star formation with minimal external influence .",
    "based on the evidence seen in small velocity widths in the 3  lines around this region , the younger generation of ysos distributed around the center of the peak of the 3  ( 1,1 ) emission at the core of   may have formed spontaneously .",
    "@xcite gave a warning in distinguishing triggered population from spontaneously formed ones , and interpreting the observational data of star forming region in terms of triggering .",
    "although our observations show g134.2 + 0.8 and the w4 bubble are interacting with  and has affected its structure , it is not evident that most stars in this region were formed by the induced mode . @xcite compared the star formation efficiency and rate with w3 main and the nearby low - mass star forming regions , and showed the star forming activity in afgl333 region is comparable to other low - mass regions . as the mass of the cloud estimated by them is consistent with ours , the star formation efficiency ( sfe @xmath122 ) ) is as low as 3% .",
    "the stellar feedback has not globally enhanced the star forming activity in this region .",
    "our finding of the small velocity width of 3  line in the   and the existing literatures as an older population in the western side of the afgl333 region suggest apparent coexistence of induced and quiescent modes of star formation within several parsec scale .",

    "* ) . in the case of gem",
    "ob1 cloud , the dense cloud in contact with an expanding  region showed no obvious observable interaction between them @xcite . on the other hand , the observed large velocity widths found in the northern and southern surroundings of  region g134.2 + 0.8 ( see figure [ fig:04 ] ) is evident , and these feature suggests g134.2 + 0.8 is interacting with the dense molecular gas of .",
    "no 3  emission was detected in and to the east of g134.2 + 0.8 , but the 3  emission detected to the west of it ( around the center of ) showed no significant velocity width .",
    "the surface of the cloud might be irradiated by uv photons from the g134.2 + 0.8 .",

    "these photon flux is approximately one order of magnitude smaller than for the typical star forming clouds at the edge of  bubbles described in the collect - and - collapse model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the activity of young stars embedded in the cloud might be a source of turbulent motion , but there is not so many young objects in these regions .",
    "one explanation for the north - south alignment of this interaction could be an injection of mechanical energy from yso jets or high - velocity outflows located near the center of g134.2 + 0.8 , interacting with the dense cloud around it .",
    "although , such shock activities provide possible explanation for the observed large velocity widths , co observations by @xcite show no sign of a high velocity component expected in the case of such outflows .",
    "the systematic outflow survey of iras sources by @xcite also reported negative results for the afgl333 region .",
    "however , we should notice that co observations by @xcite were not so deep to detect faint high velocity wing , because their work was to study the physical and chemical states of the cloud . and",

    "the radio continuum emission of g134.2 + 0.8 fits into the hole of the @xmath3co map . the cavity or shell - like structure of @xmath3co emission with the size of 2  ( 1.2 pc ) hosting the dense ionized gas is reminiscent of the molecular dissociation or dynamical effect of the  region on the molecular cloud .",

    "the synthesized radio continuum map of g134.2 + 0.8 @xcite shows steep decline of intensity toward the eastern direction ( see figure [ fig:13]b ) .",

    "such a structure also shows the evidence of the shell with the expanding motion of @xmath130 .",
    "contrary to the north and south of g134.2 + 0.8 , the reason for the 3  velocity width of @xmath131 at the west , nearly as low as the main part of the cloud , might be the geometrical effect .",
    "the most dense part of the 3  ridge is deeply embedded in  along the line of sight .",
    "g134.2 + 0.8 is mostly expanding into the west at the foreground of the 3  ridge , and could not interact in the western boundary of the compact  region . the interaction is limited in the northern and the southern less dense part of the 3  ridge .",
    "the large velocity width around @xmath132 in figure [ fig:15 ] corresponds to the northern large width 3  region .",
    "although sed of the exciting star candidate ( see subsection 4.2 ) suggests that it is class i source @xcite , there is no other characteristic signatures of young activity .",
    "furthermore , because of its relatively low density , g134.2 + 0.8 is not as young @xcite as the other compact or ultracompact  regions , like g133.8 + 1.4 ( w3n ) and w3(oh ) @xcite , associated with infrared sources in the w3/w4 region . for the large line width regions of 3  emission ,",
    "the explanation invoking interaction by the expanding motion of the ionized gas at the periphery of  is more preferable at present .",
    "the large line width could be due to turbulent motion supplied through the shock front of g134.2 + 0.8 in the low ambient density .",
    "molecular line observations with higher resolution is needed to clarify the activity of the ysos in g134.2 + 0.8 .",
    "through our 3  mapping observations of afgl333 in the w4 region using the nobeyama 45 m radio telescope and archival co and other data , we have explored the physical properties of this region and studied ysos in two iras sources .",
    "our results and conclusions are summarized as follows :    \\1 .",
    "we derived a size of @xmath31 pc , the rotational temperature of @xmath61 k , and lte mass of @xmath85 for the  molecular cloud .",
    "the viral mass was estimated to be @xmath90 . possibly indicating that the  is not close to a virialized state .",
    "we found two regions of large 3  line width at the eastern side of .",
    "the large 3  line width at the north and the south of iras02245@xmath16115 suggests an interaction by the expanding motion of the ionized gas from the compact hii region g134.2 + 0.8 at the periphery of .",
    "@xmath3co data obtained by hht and nro reveal a cavity structure with the size of 1.2 pc in the integrated intensity maps , with an expanding motion of a few  in the position velocity maps .",
    "however , the small velocity widths in 3  gas observed west of iras02245@xmath16115 , around the center of the dense molecular gas , suggest that interaction with the compact  region is limited .",
    "two 2o  masers were detected .",
    "the southern - maser at the core of  was a new finding .",
    "a co bipolar outflow , a signpost of active star formation , was found near this maser source and it appears to be associated with some class i / ii sources .",
    "we examined the distribution of ysos in the afgl333 region , especially around iras02245@xmath16115 and iras02244@xmath16117 .",
    "we confirmed that g134.2 + 0.8 associated with iras02245@xmath16115 is excited by a deeply embedded young intermediate - mass star .",
    "although the w4 bubble and   have previously interacted , and induced mode of star formation could be responsible for the formation of sfo05 and iras02245@xmath16115 , the small velocity width , low rotational temperature of 3  line , and low sfe suggests that most stars in this region were formed by the quiescent mode in the feedback - driven structure . depending on the local environment , both of the two modes of star formation , induced and quiescent , coexist in scales of several pc or less .",
    "it appears that star formation in this region has taken place mainly without an external trigger , but accompanying stellar feedback environment .",
