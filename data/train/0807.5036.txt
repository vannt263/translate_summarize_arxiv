    "it is well known that the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , successful as it is in describing the strong , electromagnetic , and weak interactions , can not be complete .",
    "it does not allow for the incorporation of gravitation ; and the mass of its scalar higgs boson receives quadratic radiative corrections , making it unnatural for it to be as low as the order of the electroweak symmetry breaking scale , several hundred .",
    "the most popular extension of the sm designed to address these issues is supersymmetry or susy . for each sm particle",
    ", it introduces a partner with spin differing by half a unit but with otherwise the same properties .",
    "this allows for a cancellation of radiative corrections due to loops of sm particles and their superpartners .",
    "but supersymmetry must be broken , for otherwise the superpartners masses would equal those of the sm particles , and susy would have long been discovered .",
    "the precise breaking mechanism depends on the interactions at energy scales inaccessible by the present - day colliders , and is not known .",
    "a practical approach towards a description of susy phenomena at the energy scales accessible at experiments being conducted or in preparation is to consider the general _ effective _ theory obtained upon susy breaking : this is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . besides susy conserving interactions",
    ", it features _ soft susy breaking _ interactions that still maintain the cancellation of quadratic corrections to scalar masses , one of the reasons to introduce susy in the first place .",
    "the mssm constructed in this fashion does have one severe drawback , however : it features 105 new and _ a priori _ arbitrary parameters .",
    "even if many of these would give rise to unobserved features such as lepton flavour violation , and are hence constrained by measurements , the exploration of the full mssm parameter space is a daunting task .",
    "in contrast , the same higgs sector that is at the root of the problems with the sm is described ( at tree level ) by a mere two parameters .",
    "susy requires the existence of two higgs doublets ( of hypercharge @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) . upon electroweak symmetry breaking , this results in five physical higgs bosons : two charged ones , @xmath2 , two cp - even neutral ones , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( by convention @xmath5 ) , and one cp - odd one , @xmath6 . at tree level",
    ", all masses can be expressed as a function of only two parameters , usually taken to be @xmath7 and the ratio of the two higgs doublets vacuum expectation values @xmath8 .",
    "also the higgs boson couplings to sm particles can be expressed as a function of @xmath7 and @xmath9 .",
    "table  [ tab : couplings ] shows the neutral higgs boson couplings ( here , @xmath10 is not a free parameter but itself depends on @xmath9 and @xmath7 ) ; the @xmath11 coupling is proportional to @xmath12 .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a remarkable feature is that ( again at tree level ) @xmath13 . this sole fact would be enough to exclude the mssm , were it not for the fact that radiative corrections relax these constraints . in principle , these radiative corrections involve the whole mssm , but the number of parameters contributing substantially is still small . as a general matter , a constraint @xmath14 remains .",
    "the radiative corrections affect the higgs bosons couplings as well as their masses . rather than considering the whole mssm parameter space , several representative _ scenarios",
    "_ are typically considered that evade the bounds set by searches for higgs bosons conducted at the lep @xmath15 collider .",
    "specifically , the scenarios considered here are @xmath16  scenario ( with mssm parameters tuned to obtain the highest possible @xmath17 ) and the no - mixing scenario ( with parameters tuned to switch off the mixing between the @xmath18 and @xmath19 superpartners of the top quark )  @xcite . within these scenarios ,",
    "the higgsino mass parameter @xmath20 is in principle fixed ; however , given the sensitivity to this parameter , both @xmath21 and @xmath22 are considered in some of the analyses below .",
    "previous searches at lep for neutral higgs bosons have excluded a large region of the ( @xmath7,@xmath9 ) parameter space where the lightest higgs boson becomes sufficiently light to be accessible at lep . in particular ,",
    "the low @xmath9 region has been excluded up to large values of @xmath7 .",
    "the searches conducted at the tevatron collider are largely complementary to those earlier searches . at large values of @xmath9 ,",
    "the enhanced couplings to @xmath23 quarks and @xmath24 leptons lead to significantly increased production cross sections .",
    "this fact , in combination with the particular signatures of @xmath23-quark jets and @xmath24 leptons , is exploited below .    as a consequence of large @xmath9 , the masses of the @xmath6 and @xmath4 bosons ( or @xmath6 and @xmath3 , for low values of @xmath7 ) become almost degenerate ( their mass difference becomes less than the corresponding detector resolution ) .",
    "this allows for a significant simplification in the analyses : rather than attempting to identify the two nearby resonances , they are simply lumped together , and denoted as @xmath25 below . by comparison , the contribution from the `` third '' neutral higgs boson becomes negligible .",
    "the @xmath23 quark being the heaviest sm isospin @xmath27 fermion , the @xmath26 branching fraction is the largest one for high values of @xmath9 , becoming as high as @xmath28 0.9 . as a consequence",
    ", it constitutes one of the dominant search channels .",
    "unfortunately , this decay can not be identified inclusively , due to an overwhelming qcd @xmath29 production background . instead , one looks for the final state in which the @xmath25 is radiated off an initial state @xmath23 quark .",
    "a significant ( @xmath30 ) cross section enhancement occurs also in this final state ; the identification of a third @xmath23 jet , typically of lower @xmath31 , suppresses greatly the qcd background .",
    "the cdf collaboration has searched for the @xmath32 channel in a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.9 fb@xmath33 , requiring all jets in a three - jet sample to be @xmath23-tagged by a displaced vertex algorithm  @xcite .",
    "even this triple - tagged sample is dominated by qcd backgrounds .",
    "each jet may be a genuine @xmath23-quark jet , or a fake ( charm or light - flavour ) jet .",
    "the two leading jets , hypothesized to result from the @xmath25 decay , are treated on an equal footing .",
    "therefore , considering only those final states containing at least two genuine @xmath23-quark jets leads to five background categories : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 ( here , @xmath39 denotes a light - flavour jet ) .",
    "the distribution of the invariant mass @xmath40 of the two leading jets for the signal is taken from simulation .",
    "for the backgrounds no adequate simulation exists , and templates for each of the above categories are obtained starting from a data sample containing at least two @xmath23 tags .",
    "for the first three categories , this starts from a @xmath41 sample to which parametrized efficiencies for tagging the third jet ( @xmath23 , @xmath42 , or @xmath39 ) are applied ; for the @xmath38 category , a similar procedure is applied to events with the third and one of the two leading jets already tagged .",
    "an additional correction , derived from simulation , is applied to account for the different processes contributing to final states with more than two @xmath23 jets .",
    "finally , the @xmath37 distribution is assumed to look like the @xmath34 one , but with only a subset of processes contributing ; another simulation - derived correction is applied to account for this .    the normalization of the distributions obtained in this fashion are adjusted to fit the data distribution . however , as can be observed from fig .",
    "[ cdf - hbb ] , some of the background templates can not be distinguished .",
    "therefore , a second variable involving the vertex masses ( the invariant mass of all tracks , assuming they are @xmath43 , attached to the displaced vertices ) is constructed .",
    "this is done starting from the same data samples above , and uses the same information in addition to known vertex mass distributions for different flavours .",

    "no significant improvement in the fit likelihood is observed upon inclusion of a signal component ; limits on a possible signal component are set in a modified frequentist framework based on  @xcite .",
    "a complication is that for sufficiently high values of @xmath9 , the neutral higgs boson decay width exceeds the experimental invariant mass resolution .",
    "the resulting broadening of the signal @xmath40 distribution reduces the discrimination power between signal and backgrounds , and needs to be taken into account explicitly .",
    "a similar analysis has been carried out by the d0 collaboration on a 1 fb@xmath33 dataset  @xcite . an artificial neural network @xmath23-tagging algorithm exploiting lifetime information was employed . rather than using a second discriminating variable to determine the various background components , multiple @xmath23-tagging criteria ( with known efficiencies ) are used to determine the composition of the double - tagged sample .    a second discriminating variable , based on kinematic information ,",
