    "the discovery of new spin - orbit related phenomena and states of matter lead to an immense increase of interest in materials containing @xmath0 elements , ir and os in particular .",
    "@xcite among the new effects ,  @xcite recently proposed a possibility of excitonic condensation in @xmath1 materials with cubic local symmetry .",
    "the singlet atomic ground state promises no interesting low - energy physics .",
    "however , if the energy of the lowest excitation , a magnetic moment carrying triplet , is sufficiently small , the inter - atomic exchange due to electron hopping may lead to formation of an ordered state - excitonic magnet .",
    "thanks to the singlet - triplet exchange processes , the excitations can be viewed as mobile quasi - particles propagating on the singlet background with a non - trivial dispersion .",
    "if the the bottom of this dispersion touches the singlet level a phase transition ( bose - einstein condensation ) takes place . in some systems pairwise creation and annihilation of s on the neighboring atoms",
    "plays a role similar to the hopping .",
    "realization of the s proposal  @xcite is an interesting challenge since the spin - orbit coupling must be strong enough to enhance the correlation physics , but not too strong to allow sufficiently small singlet - triplet gap .",
    "recently , a curious magnetic behavior was observed in ( syio ) , which was interpreted as excitonic magnetism .",
    "@xcite in particular , it was argued that non - cubic crystal field splits the triplet state and thus reduces the first excitation energy of the ir ion .",
    "subsequent band structure calculations  @xcite found only moderate non - cubic crystal field on ir site and found that the physics of syio is similar to its cubic analog ( byio ) .",
    "the gga+u calculations to a magnetically ordered ground state , which the authors interpreted as confirmation of the experimental data .    in article we combine several methods to analyse the physics of byio and syio .",
    "our results contradict the conclusions of refs .   as we find byio and syio to be insulators with singlet local ground state .",
    "we show that using the same gga+u approach as in ref .",
    "a solution corresponding to the singlet ground state has a lower energy than the solution containing magnetic moments .",
    "this result is supported by dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) calculations performed with full interaction vertex .",
    "we conclude with a sufficient margin for uncertainties of various model parameters that the inter - atomic exchange processes in the studied double perovskites are too weak to overcome the singlet - triplet splitting due to the spin - orbit coupling . this result can be put to the perspective of the recent observation of signatures of excitonic magnetism in ca@xmath2ruo@xmath3  @xcite , a @xmath4 perovskite where spin - orbit coupling is weaker and",
    "ru - ru hopping is stronger than in ir double perovskites .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after introducing the computational methods in sec .",
    "[ sec : comp ] we discuss the bonding in double perovskite structure and construct an effective hubbard model on the basis of band structure calculations ( sec .",
    "[ sec : gga ] ) . to compare with previous studies we have performed hartree - like gga+u calculations reported in sec .",
    "[ sec : ldau ] . in the rest of the paper",
    "we analyze the multi - band hubbard model .",
    "first , we study the single - site problem with the focus on singlet - triplet splitting and van vleck susceptibility using exact diagonalization ( sec .  [",
    "sec : ed ] ) .",
    "next , we calculate the one - particle properties of the lattice problem using dmft ( sec .  [ sec : dmft ] ) and the dynamic of two - particle excitations in the strong - coupling expansion ( sec .  [",
    "sec : t2u ] ) .",
    "in this work we combine several numerical and semi - analytical approaches . all the below described calculations",
    "were performed for cubic byio .",
    "the key steps were performed also for orthorhombic syio .",
    "we start with gga  @xcite density functional calculations employing the wien2k  @xcite package .",
    "all the results reported here were obtained with the spin - orbit coupling included   @xcite .",
    "the crystallographic as well as other parameters used in the calculations are summarized in supplemental material ( sm )  @xcite .    to include the correlation effects on the ir site beyond the effective non - interacting picture of gga we follow two paths .",
    "first , we use the static mean - field approach of gga+u . since this approach is known to often lead to multiple solutions we have run series of calculations for various initial conditions .",
    "in particular , we used the spin - polarized gga solution and atomic ground state as starting points .",
    "the calculations were performed for interaction parameters @xmath5 of 2 , 4 and 6  ev and @xmath6 from 0.1 to 0.7  ev . the so called fully localized limit double counting correction was used  @xcite .",
    "although it should be a standard for systems with strong spin - orbit coupling , we note explicitly that spin - off - diagonal terms of the +u orbital potential were included in the calculation .",
    "second , we use the non - spin - polarized gga band structures to construct effective hubbard models . employing wien2wannier  @xcite and wannier90  @xcite codes to construct the wannier representation of the gga bands we can extract the crystal - field  @xcite and spin - orbit parameters as well as the inter - atomic hoppings . for the calculation of the partially screened coulomb interaction",
    ", we used the density response code for elk  @xcite . in the calculation of the constrained susceptibility , we excluded the contribution of particle - hole excitations within the target bands ( the @xmath7 bands for the @xmath8-model , and @xmath7 and o @xmath9 bands for the @xmath10 model ) and took 80 unoccupied bands .",
    "we used 4@xmath114@xmath114 @xmath12 and @xmath13 meshes for the double fourier transform with the cutoff @xmath14=1 , 2 , 3.5 ( 1/a.u . ) , where @xmath15 is the reciprocal vector , and then extrapolated the result to @xmath16 .",
    "we study two types of model hamiltonians : ( i ) @xmath8-model in the space of ir - like @xmath7 bands and ( ii ) @xmath10-model covering the space of ir-@xmath8 and o-@xmath9 bands .",
    "the two models were expressed in two bases : ( a ) real cubic harmonics with sharp spin and ( b ) the eigenbasis of the local one - particle hamiltonian with doublet and quadruplet ( @xmath17-basis ) .",
    "the two bases are equivalent and their use followed numerical convenience .",
    "we use both @xmath8- and @xmath10-model primarily to demonstrate robustness of our results .",
    "the questions of @xmath8 vs @xmath10 model was discussed by several authors  * ? ? ? * in the context of oxides of @xmath18 elements .",
    "the basic difference between the two models consists in how they describe low - energy one - particle excitations , whose orbital character is a mixture of atomic - like ir-@xmath8 and o-@xmath9 orbitals . in @xmath8-model",
    "these excitations are molecular orbitals ( anti - bonding @xmath10 combinations ) whose structure is determined solely by the @xmath10 hybridization and does not depend on the interaction strength . in the @xmath10-model the orbital structure of the excitations",
    "is affected by the interaction and can evolve from the non - interacting molecular orbital limit to the heitler - london limit where the double occupancy of the atomic orbitals is suppressed . while the @xmath10-model , which can describe richer physics , appears superior to the @xmath8-model , in practice it is not necessarily so .",
    "larger hilbert space of the @xmath10-model involves more uncertainties in its construction , the most prominent of which is the so called double - counting correction which is directly related to the @xmath10 charge transfer energy .    the basic information about the models is obtained by analyzing the local electronic structure .",
    "we performed exact diagonalization of the single - site @xmath8-model where the six @xmath7 wannier orbitals are treated as the atomic @xmath8 orbitals , and iterative lanczos diagonalization of the iro@xmath19 cluster where the complete ir @xmath8 shell is hybridized with the o @xmath9 states .",
    "this step served to determine the singlet - triplet splitting and to assess the differences between the two models , mainly the consequences of the explicit inclusion of the @xmath10 hybridization in the cluster model .    to extend the many - body calculations on the lattice we have run dmft simulations for both the @xmath8 and the @xmath10 model with the interaction parameters obtained in the crpa calculations . to this end",
    "we used our implementation of the self - consistent cycle  @xcite and the triqs hybridization - expansion continuous - time quantum monte carlo solver  @xcite ( based on the triqs library  @xcite ) .",
    "the calculations , with full coulomb vertex @xmath20 , were performed in - basis ( @xmath17-basis ) in which the on - site one - particle hamiltonian is diagonal .",
    "this choice of basis helps to avoid the monte carlo sign problem .",
    "@xcite the reported calculations were performed at the temperature of 290  k. the spectral functions were obtained by analytic continuation of the self - energy using the maximum entropy method  @xcite .",
    "while our dmft calculations were limited to studying one - particle dynamics , we use large-@xmath5 expansion of the @xmath8-model to investigate the two - particle excitations .",
    "we have eliminated the charge fluctuations by the schrieffer - wolff transformation  @xcite to the second order and constructed an effective hamiltonian on a local hilbert space spanned by the singlet and lowest triplet states .",
    "the dynamics of this effective model was studied in the linear spin wave approximation . to check the consistency of our results",
    "we have started from two different one - particle bases : the real cubic harmonics and @xmath17-basis .",
    "first , we report the unpolarized gga solution for byio , which served as a starting point to construct the effective models .",
    "the results for lower - symmetry syio are similar .      unlike in simple perovskites , where the o@xmath21 octahedra around neighboring metal atoms share corners , in double perovskites the iro@xmath21 octahedra are not touching .",
    "this geometry suggests that the double perovskites can be possibly viewed as molecular crystals built out of iro@xmath21 molecules plus some filler atoms . irrespective of whether this picture is useful for interpretation of the physics",
    ", one can use molecular orbitals ( mos ) - linear combinations of atom - centered wannier functions ( wfs ) on the o@xmath21 octahedron - as an alternative to the atom - centered wf basis .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mo ] we show the gga spectral density decomposed into the projections on the mos classified by their symmetry .",
    "first , we note the magnitude of the @xmath10 hybridization .",
    "nominally ir-@xmath8 orbitals around fermi level are superpositions of the atomic ir-@xmath8 orbital and its mo partner . for states",
    "the mixture is essentially fifty - fifty , while for and @xmath22 states the ir-@xmath8 weight is somewhat larger .",
    "we further observe that bands of distinct symmetry exhibit little hybridization .",
    "the filled non - bonding mos therefore do not play an active role in the low - energy physics .",
    "the gga+so spectral density of byio projected on the irreducible representations of the cubic symmetry in the space of @xmath10 wannier functions .",
    "top panel : projection on wfs centered on the ir atom ( the @xmath7 functions were further resolved into the and states ) .",
    "bottom panel : projection on wfs centered on the o atoms .",
    "the @xmath23 , @xmath22 and @xmath24 mos are built from atomic o-@xmath9 orbitals pointing to the central ir atom , while the remaining mos are built from atomic o-@xmath9 orbitals perpendicular to the ir - o bond . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bands ] it is demonstrated that they can be dropped from the model . we compare the gga band structure with the bands of a truncated @xmath10 model where only ir and o@xmath21 @xmath7 orbitals were kept , while the @xmath22 and non - bonding orbitals were simply left out without any adjustment of the @xmath7 subspace .",
    "the model dispersion reproduces very well the anti - bonding bands around the fermi level and does a fairly good job also for the bonding bands which overlap with the @xmath22 and @xmath23 bands .",
    "this suggests that the molecular crystal provides a useful picture of the studied double perovskites . the large bonding ",
    "anti - bonding splitting allows straightforward construction of the wannier representation of the anti - bonding bands only - the @xmath8 model .     the gga+so band structure of byio ( black ) .",
    "the bands of the @xmath10 model with @xmath7 orbitals described in the text ( red ) . ]",
    "the crpa calculations were performed for @xmath8 and @xmath10 models .",
    "the calculated direct and exchange interaction parameters in the low frequency limit can be found in sm . in our model calculations",
    "we make the common assumption of atomic form of the interaction , which is then parametrized by @xmath5 and @xmath6 which are chosen to match the crpa data . for the @xmath8-model we can fairly accurately fit the crpa data with the values @xmath5=1.8  ev and @xmath6=0.4  ev , while we get @xmath5=4  ev and @xmath6=1.1  ev for the @xmath10-model .",
    "the values of @xmath6 should be viewed as upper estimates obtained by the extrapolation of the fourier cut - off to infinity .",
    "our main conclusions in this work hold for smaller @xmath6 , but eventually break for large @xmath6 .",
    "therefore we try to use conservative ( upper limit ) values in our calculations .      allowing ferromagnetic spin - polarized solutions we arrive at similar results as reported in ref .",
    ". however , these solutions are metallic , contrary to experiment , suggesting that inclusion of electronic correlations beyond gga is desirable .",
    "the gga+u approach provides a computationally cheap way to include the electronic correlations on a hatree - fock level .",
    "the gga+u method is formally analogous to the weiss mean - field theory and as such it is prone to multiple self - consistent solutions that could be thermodynamically unstable .",
    "the authors of ref .   started from their spin polarized solutions for byio and syio and including the + u orbital potential they found these solutions to be modified , but qualitatively unchanged . while we were able to find similar spin - polarized solutions ( sm )",
    ", we extended the search for possible stable solutions by starting from the occupation matrices corresponding to the atomic ground state reported below .",
    "this way we obtained non - magnetic solutions with energies lower than their spin polarized counterparts .",
    "the spectral density of the non - magnetic solution for byio , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldau ] , confirms the picture of a local singlet ground state with filled orbitals and empty ones .     the ir @xmath7 spectral densities for the non - magnetic gga+u solutions obtained with @xmath25  ev and two values of @xmath5 .",
    "]      in the following , we present the results obtained for the @xmath8 and @xmath10 models of syio and byio .",
    "the parameters of the models obtained using the wannier projection can be found in sm .",
    "we start by discussing the physics of an isolated lattice site .",
    "the key quantity of interest is the singlet - triplet excitation energy @xmath26 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] we show the single - ion spectra of byio and syio of the @xmath8-model obtained by diagonalization of the single - site hamiltonian with 4 electrons . similar to ref .",
    "we find that the non - cubic crystal - field in syio has only minor effect and the spectrum is controlled by the spin - orbit coupling and hund s exchange @xmath6 ( note that the isotropic part @xmath5 of the on - site interaction does not affect level splitting within a given valence state . ) since the singlet - triplet splitting decreases with @xmath6 , the excitation energy @xmath26 of 270  mev is a conservative lower estimate .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > \" , ]     besides the multiplet structure we have calculated the van vleck susceptibility of the ir atom in the @xmath8-model  @xcite of syio .",
    "the susceptibility increases with @xmath6 and it exhibits an anisotropy : for @xmath6=0.4  ev its values along a , b and c axes are 0.0011 , 0.0016 and 0.0009 emu / mol ( the corresponding values for @xmath6=0.2  ev are 0.0009 , 0.0009 and 0.0008 emu / mole ) .",
    "these numbers correspond rather well to the experimental data of ref .",
    "which exhibit only a weak temperature dependence above 50  k ( @xmath270.0015  emu / mole@50  k and @xmath270.0011  emu / mole@330  k ) .",
    "next , we study the local physics of byio within the @xmath10-model , i.e. we diagonalize the iro@xmath21 cluster .",
    "we treat the o-@xmath9 states as non - interacting and put the interaction on the central ir atom only . unlike for the isolated @xmath8-shell above , the isotropic part of the interaction @xmath5 affects the results strongly .",
    "the dependence of the excitation spectrum on @xmath5 is , however , to a large extent compensated by the double - counting correction @xmath28 which renormalizes the splitting between the @xmath8 and @xmath9 orbital energies and which must be included to take into account the interaction energy present in gga .",
    "since @xmath28 is not rigorously defined , we treat it as an adjustable parameter . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] we show the singlet - triplet excitation energy @xmath26 for the iro@xmath21 cluster . rather than @xmath28",
    ", we plot our results as a function of the closely related ir-@xmath8 occupancy @xmath29 with clear physical meaning . for fixed @xmath29",
    "the excitation energy @xmath26 is practically independent of @xmath5 .",
    "we take the ir-@xmath8 occupancies between @xmath30 ( @xmath31 is the gga value ) to be physically reasonable .",
    "the corresponding singlet - triplet splitting falls into the interval 190 - 280 mev and is consistent with 270  mev obtained from the @xmath8-model .    as a side remark",
    "we point out that a popular approximation of the interaction to the density - density terms in the @xmath17-basis leads to the substantially smaller values of singlet - triplet splitting of around 100  mev .",
    "this can be traced back to the missing pair - hopping terms which contribute to lowering of the singlet energy .      in the following ,",
    "we extend our analysis to the lattice problem .",
    "we address three questions .",
    "is there a charge gap in the one - particle spectrum and what is its nature ?",
    "it there a global ground state with broken symmetry predicted by ref .  ?",
    "what is the dynamics of two - particle excitations and can they condense in the sense proposed by  @xcite ?",
    "the first and , to some extent , the second questions are studied using dmft . the second and the third questions",
    "are addressed using the effective strong coupling hamiltonian .",
    "the dmft technique incorporates local quantum and thermal fluctuations and does not typically suffer from the problem of multiple solutions with distinct local states .",
    "when several local states are quasi - degenerate the method can naturally describe their statistical mixture ( most common example being local moment fluctuations ) or even their condensate  @xcite .",
    "moreover , modern dmft implementations can treat full coulomb vertex without approximations . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmft ] we show the dmft one - particle spectra of the @xmath8 model .",
    "the dominant correlation effect is the static hartree shift of the empty band with dominant character with respect to the occupied band dominated by the character .",
    "the dynamical effects , arising from the pair - hopping terms in the interaction play only a minor role .",
    "the picture provided by dmft is therefore consistent with the gga+u non - magnetic solution .     the one - particle spectral density for the @xmath8-model of byio along high symmetry directions in the brillouin zone obtained with dmft .",
    "the side panel shows the k - integrated density resolved into ( red ) and ( black ) orbital contributions .",
    "the calculation were performed with @xmath321.8  ev , @xmath330.4  ev at the temperature of 290  k. ]      in order to assess the possibility of excitonic condensation we have to investigate the two - particle dynamics . while it can , in principle , be studied by dmft , in practice",
    "this is a difficult task which has been executed only for simple models or involving approximation .",
    "@xcite moreover , the results so far suggest that byio ( and syio ) can be viewed as strongly coupled systems with suppressed charge fluctuations .",
    "an effective strong coupling model provides a much more accessible description of the physics . in the following ,",
    "we derive such a model and solve its dynamics using the linear spin - wave theory . the model in the space spanned by the singlet and triplet states is obtained by second - order schrieffer - wolff transformation of the @xmath8 model .",
    "the classical ground state is a product of singlets .",
    "the excitations in the limit of low -density are described by an effective hamiltonian describing propagation of a single @xmath34-excitation , i.e. , we neglect for example interactions between @xmath34s , @xmath35 here , @xmath36 is the singlet - triplet splitting @xmath26 renormalised by hopping processes of the type @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the amplitude of the process @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the amplitude of the process @xmath42 . hopping to the first and second neighbors on the fcc lattice is considered . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lsw ] we present the spectrum of ( [ eq : spw ] ) along the high symmetry directions of the cubic lattice .",
    "the main observation is the large excitation gap . in the language of the s proposal the excitonic condensation takes place when the energy of the lowest triplet excitation touches the singlet ( vacuum ) level .",
    "our results show that the width of the @xmath34-dispersion is at least an order of magnitude too small for that to happen .",
    "since the parameters of ( [ eq : spw ] ) for syio are of similar magnitude as for byio we conclude that our result holds for syio as well .",
    "dispersion of a triplet excitation in singlet background obtained from @xmath8-model with @xmath43  ev and @xmath44  ev . ]",
    "the double perovskite structure with large ir - ir distance and small hopping amplitude @xmath34 is not very promising for observation of excitonic magnetism .",
    "the electronic bandwidth @xmath45 does not have to be unusually small thanks to the high number of nearest neighbors @xmath46 .",
    "the effect of small @xmath34 is much more pronounced in the dispersion of two - particle excitations with a bandwidth @xmath47 which scales as @xmath48 for fixed @xmath49 .",
    "we have combined several theoretical approaches to study the low - energy properties of ir double perovskites byio and syio .",
    "the two compounds are quite similar , in particular , the non - cubic crystal field of syio is found to be rather weak , a result that agrees with the conclusions of theoretical study of bhowal _ et al . _",
    "our main conclusion is that excitonic magnetism in byio and syio is not favored .",
    "small ir - ir hopping in double perovskite structure gives rise to valence and conduction bands that are sufficiently narrow to become orbitally polarized and gapped by a moderate on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "another consequence of the small electron hopping are small amplitudes for propagation of two - particle excitations .",
    "the bandwidth of such excitations is an order of magnitude smaller than the singlet - triplet excitation energy determined by the spin - orbit coupling and hund s exchange @xmath6 , which prevents the possibility of their exciton condensation .",
    "our conclusions contradict the conclusions of the experimental study  @xcite . while our calculated van vleck susceptibility reproduces quite well the experimental susceptibility of ref .   above 50  k",
    ", we do not find any tendency towards a magnetic phase transition at low temperatures .",
    "instead , we predict a large spin gap in the 200 mev range .",
    "our results thus call for reexamination of the experimental data considering the possibility of an extrinsic origin of the observed low temperature behavior .",
