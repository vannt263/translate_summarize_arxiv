    "temporal variations in the strengths and/or velocities of interstellar absorption lines have now been observed in a number of sight lines sampling different regions in the galactic ism ; see , e.g. , the reviews by crawford ( 2003 ) and lauroesch ( 2007 ) . the changes in the profiles of the and/or lines observed toward several stars in the direction of the vela supernova remnant ( hobbs et al .",

    "for some of those variable features , high @xmath4()/@xmath4 ( ) ratios suggest significant shock processing of the interstellar dust grains . in a number of other sight lines , however , the narrow line widths ( @xmath13 @xmath5 0.30.6 km s@xmath2 , or fwhm @xmath5 0.51.0 km  s@xmath2 ) and/or low @xmath4()/@xmath4 ( ) ratios characterizing the variable components suggest that the gas is relatively cool and quiescent ( blades et al . 1997 ; price et al .",

    "the variations appear to be due to significant transverse motion of the target stars , such that the lines of sight sample different paths through the intervening ( inhomogeneous ) interstellar clouds at different times .",
    "the observed temporal variations would then imply corresponding spatial variations in cloud properties over scales typically of tens of au .",
    "variations in absorption over somewhat larger spatial scales ( 10@xmath1510@xmath16 au ) have been observed toward a number of binary / multiple star systems ( watson & meyer 1996 ) and toward both open and globular clusters ( langer et al .",

    "the seeming ubiquity of such variations has suggested that sub - parsec - scale structure is common in the diffuse galactic ism . because and generally are trace ionization stages , however , it has not been clear whether that structure is in the overall hydrogen column density or just in the local physical conditions affecting the ionization balance . while small - scale spatial and/or temporal variations in @xmath4 ( ) have been inferred from vlbi observations of extended extragalactic radio sources ( e.g. , dieter et al .",

    "this apparent small - scale structure in predominantly neutral interstellar gas has been difficult to understand .",

    "such high densities are difficult to reconcile with clouds in thermal pressure equilibrium at typical interstellar values of @xmath18 = @xmath19 @xmath5 2500 @xmath10k ( jenkins & tripp 2001 ) .",
    "several solutions for this `` density problem '' have been proposed : ( 1 ) the differences may reflect a population of cold , dense filaments or sheets , embedded in warmer , less dense neutral gas and containing 1030% of the total column density of cold , neutral gas ( heiles 1997 ) .",
    "( 2 ) the differences may just be due to statistical fluctuations in the distribution of material at all scales along the sight lines ( deshpande 2003 ) .",

    "uv spectra of hd  219188 , covering lines from a number of species , have been obtained with the _ hst_/ghrs ( 1994.43 , 1995.37 ; fwhm @xmath5 3.5 km  s@xmath2 ) and with the _ hst_/stis ( 2001.74 , 2003.43 , 2004.42 ; fwhm @xmath5 2.3 km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "comparisons between the column densities of , , and suggest that the gas at @xmath138 km  s@xmath2 is partially ionized .",
    "no significant variations are seen for the column densities of species that are dominant in such gas ( e.g. , , , )  suggesting that both the inferred hydrogen column density [ @xmath4(h ) @xmath5 6 @xmath6 10@xmath7 @xmath8 ] and the relatively mild depletions in the @xmath138 km  s@xmath2 component were essentially unchanged between 1994 and 2004 .",
    "the column densities of the trace neutral species ( and its excited fine - structure states ) and of the excited state * , however , increased by factors of 25 between 1995 and 2001 , then declined slightly through 2003 and 2004  behavior roughly similar to that of @xmath4 ( ) over that period .",
    "the hydrogen column densities inferred from the uv data are much lower than the values that would be estimated under the assumption of `` typical '' @xmath4()/@xmath4(h ) ratios  suggesting that -based estimates of @xmath4(h ) ( and corresponding pressures and densities ) made for spatially or temporally variable components in other sight lines should be viewed as very uncertain .",
    "the variations in the fine - structure excitation imply that the thermal pressure @xmath19 in the @xmath138 km  s@xmath2 component increased by a factor of about 2 between 1995 and 2001 , then declined slightly in 20032004 .",
    "the relative excited state populations are consistent with those expected for gas at a single pressure not much higher than the values `` typically '' found for local diffuse clouds  i.e. , no high - pressure component is required .",
    "if @xmath11 = 100 k , then the local hydrogen densities would have been about 20 @xmath10 in 1995 and about 4534 @xmath10 in 20012004  slightly higher than the limits estimated for several other sight lines with observed variations in @xmath4 ( ) but much smaller than the values that would be inferred from `` typical '' /h ratios .",
    "the variations in both the @xmath4()/@xmath4 ( ) ratio and the fine - structure excitation imply that the electron density @xmath12 increased by a factor of a few between 1995 and 2001 , then declined somewhat by 20032004 .",
    "the higher values of @xmath4(*)/@xmath4 ( ) found in 2001 - 2004 imply that the temperature in the @xmath138 km  s@xmath2 component must be greater than about 50 k. while the values for @xmath12 derived from the excitation are lower by factors of 2.58.5 than the corresponding values estimated from @xmath4()/@xmath4 ( ) under the assumption of photoionization equilibrium , they still indicate that hydrogen is partially ionized .",
    "the high observed abundances of the various trace species and * ( which is excited primarily via collisions with electrons ) may be ascribed to the relatively high fractional ionization , and the variations in the column densities of , other trace species , and * appear to be due to variations in density and/or ionization  and not @xmath4(h )  on scales of tens of au .",
    "it is not clear , however , how that ionization is produced  or how the observed differences could be maintained over such small spatial / temporal scales . in any case , the variable component at @xmath138 km  s@xmath2 toward hd  219188 is not a very dense clump or filament ( although it is much thicker than it is wide ) , but may be related to a population of cold , low column density clouds ( perhaps due to turbulence ) recently detected in absorption .",
