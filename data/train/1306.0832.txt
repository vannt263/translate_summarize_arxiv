    "the semi - quasi - z - source inverter introduced in @xcite is a single - phase single - stage low - cost ( only two active components ) transformerless inverter whose input and output terminals share the same ground .",
    "this semi - quasi - z - source inverter is especially suited for renewable - energy distributed - generation photovoltaic applications and its name derives from the z - source inverter @xcite because it also contains an lc network , the distinguishing feature of the z - source inverter .",
    "however , the shoot - through state responsible for the boost capability of the z - source inverter is not applicable to the semi - quasi - z - source inverter and hence the principle of operation of the latter inverter is quite different .",
    "the semi - quasi - z - source inverter contains two active components ( such as igbts or mosfets ) which conduct in a complementary manner during normal operation ( continuous conduction mode , ccm ) .",
    "the steady - state input - output voltage gain of this inverter can theoretically be any value in the interval @xmath0 , provided the circuit is operated at a constant duty cycle with a sufficiently high switching frequency . to obtain a sinusoidal voltage waveform at the output of the inverter",
    ", @xcite asserts that if the frequency of the desired output sine wave is small enough , then the steady - state input - output gain equation would be approximately valid at every time instant ( after a possible initial transient ) and hence the required time - varying duty cycle can be deduced from this gain equation .",
    "this inverter operation strategy was tested on a 40w prototype connected to a linear purely resistive load .",
    "operating the inverter in this manner necessarily produces large - signal behavior , meaning that the linearized averaged model ( @xcite ) is not an accurate model of the evolution of the circuit variables .",
    "also , note that the inverter operation strategy as tested on the prototype is an open - loop strategy since no feedback from the circuit variables is involved in the computation of the applied duty cycle .",
    "although the inverter operation strategy proposed in @xcite was experimentally tested and showed acceptable results , the fact that such a strategy is open - loop and time - varying raises the following issues .",
    "first , extinction of the initial transient , i.e. , convergence of the state trajectory to the steady - state ( time - varying ) one , should be established for _ every possible _ initial condition and _ every possible _ value of the circuit capacitors , inductors and load .",
    "second , operation of the converter under closed - loop control , which is a necessity in order to compensate for input voltage and load variations , should be ensured not to cause unstable behavior .    in this work ,",
    "we address the aforementioned issues by showing that if the load is linear and purely resistive then neither the averaged nor the switched models state trajectories can become unbounded irrespective of the ( time - varying ) duty cycle applied ( even if it involves feedback ) , provided the duty cycle does not reach the extreme values 0 or 1 and , for the switched model , the maximum pulse - width modulator ( pwm ) switching period is suitably limited .",
    "based on these results , we show that convergence to the periodic steady - state behavior that corresponds to a periodic duty cycle ( such as that proposed in @xcite ) is ensured when the load is linear and purely resistive .    for both the averaged and the switched models , our stability results are derived by exploiting the natural energy function of the circuit , even though the quadratic term of its derivative along trajectories is only negative semidefinite . in the case of the averaged model , we show how to modify the natural energy function in order to analytically construct a suitable quadratic lyapunov function .",
    "the stability results for the averaged model provide a starting point for more complicated stability analyses , since it is known that if the switching frequency is sufficiently high , then the averaged model trajectories will be close to those of the switched model @xcite . in the case of the switched model , we remark that neither of the switching modes ( neither of the subsystems , employing switched systems terminology @xcite ) is asymptotically stable nor detectable from the output voltage , and hence stability is dependent on the limitations imposed on switching . in addition , since neither mode is asymptotically stable , then a dwell - time condition is not sufficient in order to ensure asymptotic stability .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : inverter ] , we provide a brief description of the semi - quasi - z - source inverter , derive the switched and the averaged models , and explain the duty cycle computation method of @xcite . in section  [ sec : stab - results ] , we derive the stability results for the averaged model and in section  [ sec : sw - model - stab ] those for the switched model . conclusions and future research directions are outlined in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
