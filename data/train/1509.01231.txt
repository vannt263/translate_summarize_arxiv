    "special mention in this regard should be made of mr hoffman , my high school physics teacher , who was instrumental in me pursuing a career in science and prof geyer who encouraged my pursuit of theoretical physics especially .",
    "i must also mention the extraordinary lengths that prof mller - nedebock went through at the end of 2010 and 2011 .",
    "his assistance and support over that time fills me with immense gratitude and it stands as one of the most formative times in my life .",
    "+   + the undertaking of my studies would not have been possible without the financial contributions of the wilhelm frank trust , the national institute for theoretical physics and the institute of theoretical physics at stellenbosch university .",

    "since the publication of the famous maldacena conjecture @xcite the study of the @xmath5 correspondence ( or more generally the gauge / gravity duality ) has grown into a substantial field of research . indeed , this has lead to the paper @xcite becoming one of the most cited works in history .",
    "though not the first work that probed the equivalence of gravitational theories and gauge theories ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the conjecture provided the first explicit example of the so - called gauge / gravity duality .",
    "the duality is a conjectured correspondence between certain gauge theories and theories of gravity i.e. the physical information contained in each is equivalent , only packaged differently .",
    "if a physical quantity in the one theory can be calculated in some domain of the theory s parameters then the value for a physical quantity of the dual theory can be extracted from it . in order to apply such a procedure",
    "one requires the dictionary i.e. how the physical quantities of the one theory are related to the physical quantities of the other .",
    "the seminal works in the development of the dictionary @xcite , @xcite still form the cornerstone of it @xcite , @xcite .",
    "+   + the gauge / gravity duality is significant on a conceptual level @xcite .",
    "if understood properly it holds the promise of reformulating theories of quantum gravity in terms of their dual gauge theories .",
    "this would be of great benefit since even the most well - studied model of quantum gravity , string theory , can only be formulated consistently as a perturbative theory @xcite .",
    "reformulating it in terms of its gauge theory dual would thus allow one to go beyond the perturbative expansion and formulate it consistently for all parameters .",
    "+   + this only explains part of the great interest that was sparked by the maldacena paper @xcite .",
    "the conjecture goes further to claim that , at least in some cases , the gauge / gravity duality is a strong / weak duality .",
    "this means the dual theory is solvable in a region of parameter space where the original theory is not i.e. the dual theory is weakly coupled when the original theory is strongly coupled .",
    "it thus provides one of the few ( if , in some cases , not the only ) tool to study gauge theories at strong coupling .",
    "this remarkable feature of the conjecture lies at the core of its power and has been applied in problems varying from the quark - gluon plasma @xcite to holographic superconductors @xcite and condensed matter physics @xcite , @xcite .",
    "+   + as we will illustrate with reference to the maldacena conjecture @xcite , symmetries play a key role in the formulation and application of the gauge / gravity duality .",
    "the intuitive reasoning for this is reasonably clear .",
    "critical points of a quantum model can not be treated perturbatively due to a vanishing energy gap which implies a strongly coupled problem @xcite .",
    "however , the vanishing gap also implies a high degree of symmetry at the critical point .",
    "if the treatment of the quantum model is thus rearranged around the symmetries then the problem may possibly become simpler .",
    "+   + this idea that the treatment of a problem can be made simpler by rearranging it has at least one rigorous example .",
    "it is known that gauge theories permit a @xmath20 expansion in the large @xmath21 limit where @xmath21 is the dimension of the gauge group @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this simplification is , at first glance , counter - intuitive .",
    "one would expect that a gauge theory becomes more complicated as the dimension of the fundamental representation increases .",
    "the results @xcite , @xcite shows the opposite is true as long as the theory is repackaged or rearranged appropriately . in particular the large @xmath21 expansion",
    "is a topological rearrangement of feynman diagrams .",
    "it is also interesting to note that this sidesteps the issues of a perturbative expansion in the coupling constant precisely because the expansion parameter in this topological series , @xmath20 , is independent of the coupling constant . +   + though a very powerful and widely used calculational tool the gauge / gravity duality remains largely unproven .",
    "this is due , in no small part , to the theories involved in the duality being difficult to work with in their own right .",
    "the applications of the duality are numerous and consequently proving the duality is of great importance .",
    "as one may expect this is not a simple task and it is a sensible strategy to target smaller goals aimed at an eventual proof . in this",
    "regard we note , as least as far as this writer s knowledge of the literature is concerned , that there is a lack of fully systematic procedures that can construct the appropriate gravitational dual from a given quantum model .",
    "+   + in this thesis we undertake what can be viewed as a first step to realising this goal of a systematic procedure",
    ". specifically we will investigate how gravitational duals can be constructed from quantum mechanical models in a systematic way .",
    "such a procedure holds the great benefit of granting us direct access to a quantum mechanics / gravity dictionary .",
    "this would allow us to address pertinent questions . under what circumstances",
    "does a quantum mechanical model permit a dual description ? is the dual description a unique theory ?",
    "can we find evidence that repackaging a quantum mechanical theory in a dual description is useful ?",
    "of course , it is likely that numerous systematic constructions can be made .",
    "a question that we will be dealing with regularly in this thesis is whether the construction we choose reproduces existing results in the literature . if so then the systematic procedure may allow us to progress beyond these existing results in a natural way .",
    "+   + it should be emphasised that our focus in this thesis will be on quantum mechanical models and not field theories .",
    "the most notable difference is that we do not consider models with gauge symmetry so that only the global symmetries will feature in our construction . at first glance",
    "this may appear to be an oversimplification as the large @xmath21 expansion @xcite , @xcite ( @xmath21 is the dimension of the gauge group ) is no longer applicable .",
    "nonetheless , this simplification will allow the construction of simple gravitational duals and , when we focus on the simplest quantum models , we will find very good agreement with existing works in the @xmath5 literature .",
    "the construction we will employ must be seen as a toy model of holography , but one that may hopefully be extended to the more intricate setting of quantum field theory in future .",
    "+   + we will start with a discussion of the gauge / gravity duality with specific reference to the famous maldacena conjecture @xcite in chapter [ backchap ]",
    ". our discussion will be basic and only highlight the aspects of the conjecture that will be relevant to this thesis and some proposed future generalisations .",
    "+   + in chapter [ constrchap ] we will introduce the construction that takes as input a family of quantum states and produces as output a metric and anti - symmetric two - form that encodes the symmetries of the states as isometries .",
    "we will motivate why this metric , and not some other geometric construction , is a sensible first choice for a systematic procedure . in a natushell",
    "it is a relatively simple construction that respects the symmetries of the quantum model .",
    "one of the first features that will be appealing with this construction is that , if the family of quantum states is non - normalisable , we have to include additional parameters that regularise the states .",
    "these additional parameters will have the natural interpretation of  bulk \" coordinates .",
    "the quantum states then live on the  boundary \" of this manifold .",
    "both of these features fit well with the conventional gauge / gravity duality .",
    "+   + we will proceed to apply the construction to the simplest family of quantum states in chapter [ geomchap ] , time - evolved states .",
    "these are the states generated by some time - evolution of a reference state .",
    "if the reference state is non - normalisable , the hamiltonian is time - independent and we regularise the states by complexifying time then the geometry is asymptotically @xmath1 .",
    "the geometries can be much more general than this , however .",
    "we will show how de sitter and flat geometries result from the appropriate coherent states .",
    "a general feature of the geometries is that states with the same set of dynamical symmetries produce metrics that are the same up to coordinate transformation .",
    "this will imply , for example , that the duals of the free particle and harmonic oscillator states are geometrically equivalent , a rather counterintuitive result that we will discuss in further detail . at this point , without any gravitational content , we will have acquired enough results to extend one of the existing results in the @xmath2 literature @xcite",
    ". +   + chapter [ gravchap ] contains the most well - developed of our results .",
    "we proceed from the two - dimensional families of states to a gravitational dual description . by using properties of the geometric reformulation of quantum mechanics",
    "@xcite we are able to write down equations of motion for the expectation values of quantum mechanical operators .",
    "we show that , in general , these equations of motion can be matched with the on - shell field equations of a model of dilaton gravity .",
    "depending on the manifold symmetries and the expectation value being solved for , an appropriate energy momentum tensor may have to be included .",
    "+   + as a specific example we examine the dilaton gravity duals of the @xmath22 class of hamiltonians .",
    "we find very good agreement with the work of @xcite-@xcite and find interpretations for the dilaton black hole mass in terms of the @xmath0 operators . with our machinery",
    "we are able to reproduce these results very naturally .",
    "we draw particular attention to the calculation of the @xmath23 central charge from the dilaton gravity description which , in our construction , can be related directly to conformal transformation which are in turn related to the unconstrained field equation solutions .",
    "this picture of the calculation makes matters very clear . we will , furthermore , be able to extend these existing results beyond the expectation values of symmetry generators .",
    "we will also briefly explore the dual descriptions of states that lead to a de sitter geometry .",
    "the results are not as well - developed as the @xmath22 class of hamiltonians , but interesting nonetheless .",
    "+   + our attention will then move to the higher dimensional families of states . in chapter [ highdim ]",
    "we add spatial translations to the time - evolved states and examine their dual descriptions .",
    "the generators of dynamical symmetry of the simplest model , the free particle , are generated by the so - called schrdinger algebra .",
    "even for this simple case we encounter several difficulties in putting together the dictionary .",
    "firstly , the metrics we find are no longer conformally flat .",
    "the non - zero weyl tensor complicates the equations of motion .",
    "we show how this can be remedied by only considering the trace of the equations of motion thereby exchanging the equations we do not consider for boundary conditions .",
    "a second difficulty is more problematic . in the regularisation scheme",
    "we employ in the chapter , the manifolds are also not einstein , even for the free particle , so that the expectation values require quite a bit of calculational maneuvering to recover .",
    "the scheme is presented at the end of chapter [ highdim ] but further work is needed to understand it fully .",
    "+   + we proceed to centrally extend the schrdinger algebra and consider this central extension ( the mass ) as a dynamical variable in chapter [ mcgchap ] .",
    "this will allow us to write down a simple dictionary for the @xmath8-dimensional schrdinger algebra hamiltonians dual to a massive scalar field action on an appropriately chosen background .",
    "+   + these results do not have analogues in the @xmath5 literature , however .",
    "the most obvious departure from the conventional approach is that we have too many dimensions added in the bulk .",
    "we show that when we restrict ourselves to only a submanifold then we again recover a number of geometries studied in the literature @xcite , @xcite .",
    "unfortunately what we lose by focussing on the submanifold is the developed dictionary itself since we rely throughout on the fact that the family of quantum states is parametrised by complex coordinates in order to put it together .",
    "the states that live on the submanifold do not , in general , possess this property .",
    "we propose that one may possibly use the existing dictionary to extract the submanifold dictionary .",
    "the chapter concludes with speculations as to how this may be done . +   + what we hope to achieve in the chapters that follow is twofold .",
    "first , we showcase how a systematic procedure to build gravitational duals from quantum mechanical models is possible .",
    "even if our construction is only applicable to the simple models we study in this thesis we hope that it shows that the development of a systematic procedure for building duals is an attainable goal .",
    "secondly , we intend to show that the construction we have chosen is , at least for the problems we study , an applicable and beneficial one . the evidence for this will be the many works in literature we may add clarity to and extend .",
    "this should serve as good motivation to investigate the generalisations of this construction in future .",
    "the duality first formulated by maldacena @xcite , that of type @xmath24 string theory on @xmath25 dual to @xmath26 super yang - mills ( @xmath27 ) with an @xmath28 gauge group on the boundary , remains the most famous example of the gauge / gravity duality , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "indeed , this duality is responsible for the conjecture s historical name , the @xmath5 correspondence .",
    "the historical name originates from the type @xmath24 string theory living on anti - de sitter space ( the @xmath7 part ) and from the @xmath27 theory being a conformal field theory ( the @xmath9 part ) . in this chapter",
    "we will define all the concepts mentioned in this paragraph concretely , all in due course .",
    "good reviews on the gauge / gravity duality and its applications can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . a good discussion can also be found in @xcite .",
    "these examples cover a very small fraction of the available literature on the @xmath5 correspondence but will be sufficient for our purposes in this thesis .",
    "+   + the conjectured correspondence is remarkable first and foremost since both of these theories ( string theory and super yang - mills ) are difficult to work with in their own right .",
    "consequently it is also a very hard ( and still an unaccomplished ) task to prove the conjecture in full , even for this well - studied example @xcite .",
    "this famous example is exceptionally well understood and it thus still serves as a means to lay out the holographic dictionary in a clear way .",
    "we will proceed to do exactly that in this chapter .",
    "the purpose of this exercise is to illuminate the status of the construction that will be made in this thesis as a toy model of holography .",
    "this will allow us , firstly , to show which aspects of dualities may be understood and learned from by means of this toy model and secondly to identify its limitations .",
    "these limitations are important to take note of especially for future generalisations .",
    "+   + it is important to emphasise that the power of the construction we will employ lies not in its ability to capture all aspects of dualities ( consequently its status as a toy model ) . rather the power of the construction lies in its systematic nature .",
    "many familiar features of the gauge / gravity duality arise naturally in this toy model and , we believe , to a sufficient extent to warrant future attempts to generalise the construction .",
    "+   + the aim of this chapter is to partition the correspondence , with specific reference to the maldacena conjecture @xcite , into what will become aspects included in the toy model and aspects not included in the toy model .",
    "we will then develop our construction in the course of the ensuing chapters with this background knowledge and context in mind .",
    "one of the key motivations for the @xmath5 correspondence is the coincidence of the isometries of @xmath29 and the symmetries of @xmath30 where @xmath8 refers to the spacetime dimension @xcite .",
    "indeed , it is hard to imagine that two physical models can be equivalent if they do not share the same symmetries .",
    "this matching of symmetries can thus easily be seen to be a necessary condition for duals .",
    "the coincidence of symmetries is even more significant .",
    "indeed , a `` trick '' may be employed to generate conformally invariant partition functions starting from gravity actions defined on @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "a ( consistent ) theory of gravity defined on @xmath7 thus carries a consistently defined conformal field theory on its boundary .",
    "it is not clear though whether all @xmath9s can be generated in this way @xcite .",
    "+   + it is important for the purpose of the discussion we now undertake that we distinguish between global symmetries and local symmetries .",
    "we first discuss the global symmetries as these will be of particular relevance later . by global symmetry",
    "we mean that the action remains invariant if we perform the same transformation at every point .",
    "this is typically associated with a unitary operator @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the generator and the parameter @xmath33 does not have coordinate dependence .",
    "local symmetries , where the coefficient can have coordinate dependence , play a different role in the conjecture .",
    "+   + in the maldacena conjecture @xcite the global symmetry corresponds to the @xmath26 @xmath27 part .",
    "this means that the field theory is superconformal with four supercharges ( for supersymmetry ) . for the gravitational theory ( the type @xmath24 string theory )",
    "the symmetries are manifest as the isometries of @xmath25 .",
    "we will now examine these global symmetries on both sides of the maldacena conjecture more closely .",
    "as the name suggests conformal field theory ( @xmath9 ) is a quantum field theory that is invariant under conformal group transformations .",
    "the @xmath8-dimensional conformal group , @xmath35 i.e. @xmath36 , can be defined as the transformations that leave the @xmath8-dimensional flat metric in arbitrary signature , @xmath37 invariant up to a local scale factor i.e. a conformal factor @xcite . note that the integer @xmath38 is related to the signature of the metric .",
    "by @xmath39 we mean the kronecker delta function . throughout this discussion",
    "we refer to the coordinates of the conformal field theory as @xmath40 . in @xmath41 dimensions",
    "( we will discuss the @xmath42 case separately ) these are @xmath43 lorentz transformations , @xmath8 translations , @xmath8 special conformal transformations and one dilatation or scaling .",

    "the operators obtained by this differentiation process are known as descendants @xcite . +   + the desired quantities from our calculations are thus the 2- and 3-point correlation functions of primaries which take a very specific form @xcite , @xcite for @xmath9s due to the very restrictive symmetry requirements , namely @xmath75 where the coefficients",

    "specifically , a transformation is an isometry if @xmath79 i.e. the metric in the new coordinates has the same functional dependence on these new coordinates as the metric in the old coordinates had on the old coordinates .",

    "the construction ( [ prov2 ] ) takes as input a family of quantum states ( possessing some symmetries ) and gives as output a metric ( with corresponding isometries ) , @xmath508 and an anti - symmetric two - form @xmath509 ( [ provsym ] ) from this family of states .",
    "+   + a case that is of special importance is when the family of states are parametrised by @xmath114 complex coordinates @xmath510 .",
    "this is typical of coherent states but can be more general . in this special case the metric and anti - symmetric two - form",
    "are closely related , most easily seen by considering them with one co - variant and one contra - variant index . in general for these states one finds @xmath511 and , consequently @xcite , that @xmath512 by @xmath513 we mean the covariant derivative , see appendix [ appgeo ] .",
    "note that the indices of @xmath514 transform like a tensor ( the indices are raised and lowered by the metric ) .",
    "however , @xmath515 is not the inverse of @xmath516 but rather @xmath517 note that in these complex coordinates the anti - symmetric two - form is now a symplectic form .",
    "+   + in section [ georeform ] we showed explicitly how vector fields can be related to operators .",
    "if an operator @xmath12 is hermitian then the vector fields are @xmath518 where @xmath519 is the vector field and @xmath520 , the normalised expectation value of the operator @xmath12 . in the present context",
    "the dynamical symmetries are generated by hermitian operators so that the first vector field in ( [ operatorvector ] ) will be applicable .",
    "note that the vector field associated with the operator @xmath12 and @xmath521 where @xmath112 is a constant is the same .",
    "this freedom will prove useful later . as a specific example of ( [ operatorvector ] )",
    "consider the killing vectors which satisfy killing s equations ( [ killing ] ) and are related , via ( [ operatorvector ] ) , to the normalised expectation values of symmetry generators . in general , the vector fields ( [ operatorvector ] ) satisfy the relation @xmath522 where we will refer to the tensor @xmath523 as the flow parameters .",
    "the flow parameters can be viewed as an indication of how far the vector field deviates from a killing vector . for conformal killing vectors , which transform the metric up to a conformal factor ,",
    "the flow parameters are given by @xmath524 where @xmath525 is an arbitrary function of the coordinates .",
    "+   + the mapping ( [ prov2 ] ) from quantum states to metric encodes all the symmetries of the quantum states as isometries of the metric .",
    "the killing vectors of the metric are thus related to the normalised expectation values of symmetry generators of the original quantum states in a simple way .",
    "this relation is of critical importance .",
    "the killing vectors , vector fields on the manifold - a  geometric concept \" - is directly related to the normalised expectation value of a generator of symmetry - an operator , a quantum observable .",
    "similarly the expectation value of an arbitrary operator on the quantum side may be related to a corresponding vector field on the geometric side of the construction ( [ flowkill ] ) . in this way",
    "there exists a duality between the quantum mechanical operators and the vector fields .",
    "+   + note that we have not even begun to bring any sort of gravitational theory into the discussion .",
    "the relation between the quantum mechanical expectation values and vector fields on the manifold relate the quantum mechanics to purely geometric quantities .",
    "as is clear from the work of @xcite , a dual geometric description of quantum mechanical models can be constructed along these lines .",
    "+   + our interest , due to the @xmath5 correspondence , is to find a dual gravitational theory to a given quantum mechanical model .",
    "we will , for the purposes of this thesis , think of gravitational theories in terms of an action formulation .",
    "consider , then , an action that is a functional of a metric and some set of fields @xmath526 $ ] .",
    "a simple way in which our metric can be linked to a classical theory of gravity is to interpret it as the metric that yields a stationary value for the action i.e. @xmath527 where @xmath528 are the values for the fields that , along with our metric , solve the equations of motion of the classical gravitational model . since the metric is tied to the gravitational theory by means of the stationary action we can expect that our dual theories will likely be built around the semi - classical approximations of gravity models .",
    "as a first attempt to constructing duals this is a workable simplification . if this first attempt gives sensible results then we can ask the question how one may interpret the fluctuations around the stationary action .",
    "we leave this topic for future work .",
    "+   + of course , the simplest subset of these gravitational theories is where no fields are present so that the action is a functional of only the metric .",
    "we will not be considering actions of this type for two reasons .",
    "firstly , in the @xmath5 correspondence the fields that feature in the theory of gravity play a vital role since their boundary values are the sources of the generating functional ( [ pathint ] ) .",
    "any gravitational dual that would hope to be comparable to existing literature must thus contain fields .",
    "secondly , for the two - dimensional manifolds - our starting point - the einstein equations are trivial .",
    "we will speak more to this in section [ jtsection ] .",
    "+   + we will be looking to construct a dual theory where the gravitational action is a functional of both the metric and fields .",
    "the immediate question is then - what interpretation can we attach to the fields ? as mentioned in section [ corrgenf ] ,",
    "the conventional interpretation of the fields is that their boundary values are the sources of the generating functional .",
    "however , our metric ( [ prov2 ] ) is constructed from the overlap of states which carries no knowledge of the sources . in order to proceed with this interpretation and",
    "analyse it systematically we will probably have to develop a rather sophisticated algorithm .",
    "it should be possible to investigate this - a topic for future research .",
    "the interpretation we will propose for this thesis is a much more direct and simple one and it will allow us to generate some interesting results . +   + it is worthwhile to recall that the quantities of interest are the correlation functions ( [ corrfuncsdef ] ) i.e. the expectation values of arbitrary strings of observables .",
    "the simplest , most direct way that we can extract these expectation values is to interpret the fields that solve the equations of motion ( [ actionfield ] ) as these same expectation values .",
    "this may be a beneficial choice as well .",
    "we know already from our discussion in section [ georeform ] that the expectation values of operators are related to vector fields on the manifold",
    ". the equations of motions that expectation values of the generators of symmetry should solve are thus likely to be of a simple form , since these should be related to the killing equation ( [ killing ] ) .",
    "+   + we will show in the chapters ahead how , despite being at odds with the conventional interpretation in @xmath5 , this interpretation of the fields in the gravitational model will allow us to calculate the expectation values of arbitrary string of symmetry generators , at least for the simplest quantum models .",
    "also , intriguingly , we will reproduce several existing results of the @xmath2 literature which seemingly indicate that these are sensible choices .",
    "+   + now that we have selected the criteria for our dual gravitational model ( [ actionfield ] ) we can proceed to find one that fits them . before we do this",
    "we will first discuss a general way in which the symmetries of the quantum states can be used to calculate the expectation values of arbitrary strings of symmetry generators .",
    "this procedure will again highlight the key role played by symmetries .",
    "the relation between the expectation values of symmetry generators and killing vectors may be verified for the metrics ( [ fullmetric ] ) of the @xmath22 family of states and the corresponding killing vectors ( [ killingsu11 ] ) by using the normalised expectation values @xmath529 } \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\langle \\beta , t| d | \\beta , t\\rangle & = & \\frac { k \\sin(2 \\omega t ) } { \\sinh(2 \\omega \\beta ) } \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\langle \\beta , t| k | \\beta , t\\rangle & = & \\frac { k ( \\cosh(2 \\omega \\beta ) - \\cos(2 \\omega t))}{\\omega \\sinh[2 \\beta \\omega ] } \\label{hoexpect}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the harmonic oscillator states . applying eq .",
    "( [ operatorvector ] ) to the expectation values ( [ hoexpect ] ) yields the killing vectors ( [ killingsu11 ] ) .",
    "note that , as it should , the vector fields are related to the expectation values even though they are not written in complex coordinates .",
    "the choice of coordinates does not affect these relations .",
    "we will now show how many physical quantities can be calculated using only the expectation values of symmetry generators and symmetry transformations .",
    "first we will derive results for an arbitrary set of real coordinates , @xmath530 and then show some noteworthy features particular to the complex coordinates .",
    "+   + we note the following general feature . given a generator of symmetry @xmath531 and its corresponding killing vector @xmath532 we note that @xmath533 where @xmath534 is an arbitrary bra independent of the coordinates and @xmath535 a normalisation factor associated with the dynamical symmetry ( [ dynamicsymm ] ) .",
    "+   + the consequence of ( [ killop ] ) is that @xmath536 where @xmath12 is an arbitrary operator . from this",
    "we derive ( from the leading order in @xmath33 ) that @xmath537 \\",
    "| \\vec{s } \\rangle .",
    "\\label{killcomm}\\ ] ] in the complex coordinates @xmath538 we can exploit another property .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath539 where the derivatives @xmath540 are with respect to the holomorphic coordinates only and @xmath541 .",
    "this procedure thus inserts an operator into the existing expectation value . note that we require the expectation value of an operator as a starting point for this insertion procedure .",
    "the derivation of the result is almost identical to ( [ killcomm ] ) . from the overlap ( [ killgen ] )",
    "one may calculate the overlap @xmath542 by algebraic means if the overlap @xmath543 is also known . a more general expression than eq .",
    "( [ killgen ] ) is given by @xmath544 where @xmath234 is hermitian and @xmath12 is an arbitrary operator .",
    "the two lemmas ( [ killcomm ] ) and ( [ killgen ] ) now allow one to generate an arbitrary string of symmetry generators @xmath545 inside the expectation value .",
    "it is crucial , for this procedure to work that the states can be parametrised by complex coordinates and that the normalised expectation values of the symmetry generators are known .",
    "the results of ( [ killcomm ] ) and ( [ killgen ] ) indicate that , by using only the expectation values of symmetry generators and complex coordinates as a starting point , the expectation value of an arbitrary string of symmetry generators can be calculated .",
    "the symmetry transformations can be calculated by solving the killing equations ( [ killing ] ) and the normalised expectation values can be calculated from their relation to the killing vectors ( [ operatorvector ] ) .",
    "of course , the larger the symmetry group the more expectation values can be calculated in this way . for coherent states of some group",
    "we can calculate any string of operators from the enveloping algebra using only these quantities .",
    "+   + two comments are in order here .",
    "firstly , it is clear that if our interest is limited to the expectation values of symmetry generators there is no need to consider a gravitational dual since the geometry will suffice .",
    "the killing vectors capture the symmetries and the expectation values of the corresponding symmetry generators may be calculated from these ( [ operatorvector ] ) . as shown in section [ symmcalc ] , these quantities are all that are required to calculate an arbitrary string of symmetry generators , when dealing with complex coordinate states . in terms of the goal of constructing a gravitational dual",
    "this is a promising feature since it guarantees that these same quantities of interest can be extracted from the gravitational dual .",
    "however , it also muddles the motivation for seeking a gravitational dual in the first place - why bother if the geometry is already sufficient to calculate the quantities of interest ?",
    "+   + it needs to be remembered that the results we have derived thus far depend on the fact that we have states parametrised by complex coordinates .",
    "certainly , there are many interesting choices of normalisable states that do not have this feature and , indeed , we will encounter examples in chapter [ mcgchap ] .",
    "the choice of complex coordinates is beneficial since it has very useful properties and will allow us to construct gravitational duals more simply .",
    "it thus serves as a useful benchmark before less favourable examples are considered .",
    "in addition it is likely that there may be quantities of interest that are not expectation values e.g. the central charge .",
    "our aim is to proceed from the relation between the expectation values of operators and vector fields on the manifold ( [ operatorvector ] ) to a gravitational dual .",
    "as mentioned , our strategy is to identify an action where the metric and expectation values of operators leave the action integral stationary . in order to gain some insight into",
    "how such an action may be chosen we will now proceed to write down equations of motion for the expectation values of operators .",
    "once we have these equations of motion our second step will be to match these to the field equations of a theory of gravity .",
    "the discussion presented here will make no assumptions of the dimension of the manifold but we will specialise to the two - dimensional case in section [ twodimeom ] and proceed with that in the remainder of this chapter",
    ". we will return to the higher - dimensional case in chapters [ highdim ] and [ mcgchap ] .",
    "again , we emphasise that we assume that the quantum states may be parametrised by a set of complex coordinates . +   + a general vector field on the manifold satisfies ( [ flowkill ] ) , restated here for convenience , @xmath546 where @xmath523 are what we refer to as the flow parameters .",
    "two notable examples are the killing vectors which have @xmath547 and conformal killing vectors with @xmath548 ( [ kappadef ] ) .",
    "furthermore , like any vector field , they also satisfy @xmath549 where @xmath550 is the riemann curvature tensor .",
    "combining cyclic permutations of ( [ riemdef ] ) and using ( [ floweq ] ) leads to @xcite @xmath551 where the tensor @xmath552 is defined in the second expression .",
    "the vector fields , as discussed , are related to the normalised expectation values of operators ( [ operatorvector ] ) .",
    "we label the arbitrary expectation value by @xmath553 , which then satisfies @xmath554 after using the property that @xmath508 and @xmath509 have zero covariant derivative ( [ compat ] ) .",
    "( [ eom ] ) can be thought of as an equation of motion for the scalar @xmath553 . on the left hand side",
    "we have a third order differential operator while on the right hand side we have a first order differential operator .",
    "+   + in order to link these equations of motion to the equations of motion of a theory of gravity we would like them to have at most second order derivatives .",
    "we should then be able to find a theory of gravity that yield , as the field equation solution , the expectation value of some operator .",
    "it is worthwhile to note an alternative , namely that we may consider the equation ( [ eom ] ) as a second order differential equation for the vector @xmath555 . it should be possible to find a gravitational action , which is a functional of a metric and vector fields , that matches these equations of motion as the field equations of the action",
    "this is a possible avenue of future study . for our purposes",
    "a second order differential equation for the scalar fields @xmath553 will be convenient especially in two dimensions . this will allow us to give elegant interpretations for the expectation values of symmetry generators and conformal symmetry generators in the context of a gravitational dual .",
    "extracting simple and elegant equations of motion with at most second order derivative from ( [ eom ] ) is not always possible . in order to simplify matters",
    "we will focus our attention on the two - dimensional manifolds . in two dimensions we can find exact second order expressions for these equations of motion owing to the special form for the riemann curvature tensor ( see appendix [ appgeo ] ) @xmath556 where @xmath557 is the scalar curvature .",
    "one may use the identity ( [ 2driem ] ) in ( [ eom ] ) to find @xmath558 we may further use the property ( [ sigmainverse ] ) to rewrite ( [ eom ] ) as @xmath559 this then implies that @xmath560 which in turn implies that @xmath561 where @xmath158 is a constant .",
    "note that the tensor @xmath562 has been defined in the last step of ( [ energymom ] ) .",
    "the undetermined term proportional to the metric is a consequence of the fact that the metric has zero covariant derivative and that the expression is symmetric ( so that a term proportional to the symplectic form is not applicable ) .",
    "we will show later how the tensor @xmath563 may be interpreted as an energy momentum tensor in a gravitational model .",
    "we will , however , not be calculating it explicitly here for any scalar curvature and flow parameter .",
    "note that if the scalar curvature is constant and @xmath553 is the expectation value of a generator of symmetry then @xmath564 .",
    "+   + not all of the three equations in ( [ eomfinal ] ) are independent @xcite .",
    "we may extract two independent equations as follows .",
    "the first comes from a contraction of indices in ( [ eomfinal ] ) .",
    "this yields @xmath565 the second can be extracted by multiplying ( [ eomfinal ] ) by @xmath566 and contracting the index @xmath98 with one of the existing indices @xmath567 the potential @xmath568 is defined in the last line . to be more specific , the quantity @xmath568 is defined as @xmath569 while the field equation is @xmath570 note that @xmath571 where @xmath112 is a constant will satisfy the same field equation . in the discussions of the gravity models from section [ jtsection ] onwards we will give a physical interpretation to the potential @xmath568 .",
    "it is customary to normalise the potential appropriately ( see e.g. @xcite ) i.e. @xmath572 but we will only do this later .",
    "the discussion up to that point will be independent of this normalisation .",
    "we may simplify the equations of motion even further in the case of a constant , non - zero scalar curvature since we have the freedom to add a constant to the scalar @xmath553 , as mentioned . by now adjusting @xmath573",
    "we can get rid of the constant @xmath158 in ( [ eomfinal ] ) i.e. @xmath574 furthermore , for the constant scalar curvature case , if @xmath553 is the expectation value of a conformal symmetry generator ( [ floweq ] ) , we can again derive simple equations of motion .",
    "we start from ( [ eom2 ] ) and contract indices so that @xmath575 here we have again shifted the scalar @xmath553 to get rid of the arbitrary constant @xmath158 .",
    "the function @xmath576 that appears in ( [ conffield ] ) is defined in ( [ kappadef ] ) and features here because we are considering conformal transformations .",
    "+   + we note finally that the field equations are a condition on the second order covariant derivative of the expectation values @xmath553 .",
    "the @xmath553 s will be the solutions of the equations of motion of the gravitational model . in the gravity model",
    "we have to give as input the appropriate energy momentum tensor @xmath563 in order to ensure that we will get the desired @xmath553 s as the solutions .",
    "the discussion here shows that , equivalently , we can specify the values of @xmath568 ( [ massfield ] ) and @xmath577 ( [ scalarfieldeq ] ) instead of the value for @xmath563 .",
    "before we proceed to specific examples of the duality we will summarise our steps from a quantum model to gravitational dual carefully .",
    "we start from a family of quantum states , which for simplicity we assume to be parametrisable in terms of complex coordinates .",
    "the quantities we are interested in on this quantum mechanical side are the expectation values of arbitrary strings of observables . on the quantum mechanical side",
    "these can be calculated using , for instance , commutation relations of the operators .",
    "+   + our focus for this thesis is rather on how these quantities can be calculated in a dual gravitational description . in this regard",
    "we showed that the expectation values of operators can be thought of as the solutions to field equations characterised by a metric and an energy momentum tensor .",
    "in other words , you give as input an energy momentum tensor and some boundary conditions and the output is the desired expectation value . the components of the energy momentum tensor , in two dimensions , can not all be chosen arbitrary .",
    "indeed , we only have the freedom to specify two of them . from these we extracted two scalar quantities from two different contractions of the energy momentum tensor - the trace of the energy momentum tensor and the potential @xmath568 . if you give as input the trace and @xmath568 , one can write down the field equations which have as solution the desired expectation value .",
    "+   + the expectation value of an operator can thus be calculated either directly from the commutation relations ( on the quantum side ) or by solving the appropriate field equations ( on the gravity side ) . the natural question to ask",
    "is how the energy - momentum tensor is to be chosen ? to this we can only provide an answer in the simplest cases e.g. where the scalar curvature is constant and one is interested in the expectation value of a generator of symmetry . for this reason",
    "the method we show here should not be thought of as a calculation tool but a proof of concept - that such a repackaging of a quantum mechanical into a gravitational theory is possible .",
    "if we have the quantum expectation values we can calculate the appropriate energy momentum tensor and vice versa . +   + what we have not shown , up to this point , is that the equations of motion ( [ eomfinal ] ) belong to a proper theory of gravity .",
    "we will address this point now .",
    "when we discussed ( qualitatively ) possible gravitational duals in section [ procgravdual ] we mentioned briefly that einstein gravity ( general relativity ) in two dimensions is not a sensible choice .",
    "this is due to the fact that any metric in two dimensions is einstein ( see appendix [ appgeo ] ) so that the field equations are always trivial and physical quantities such as the energy momentum tensor can not be imprinted on the metric .",
    "we have to consider an alternative model of gravity as a gravitational dual for two dimensional quantum states .",
    "+   + such an alternative model of gravity in two dimensions is dilaton gravity .",
    "the dilaton is a field in these models that has the physical interpretation of the volume of compactified dimensions ( which is allowed to fluctuate ) .",
    "the presence of a dilaton field is a quite general consequence when a higher dimensional model of gravity is compactified to give an equivalent lower dimensional one @xcite , @xcite .",
    "+   + this choice of gravitational model is made for two main reasons .",
    "firstly , it is a relatively simple choice of a gravitational model and indeed , the jackiw - teitelboim ( jt ) model which is only linear in the dilaton field , is arguably the simplest model of gravity one can consider beyond einstein gravity .",
    "secondly , it is precisely this model of jackiw - teitelboim gravity that has been studied in the context of the @xmath2 correspondence @xcite-@xcite . with this choice of gravitational model",
    "we can hopefully relate our construction to these existing results . for this reason we will discuss the main results of these works before we proceed to analyse the dilaton gravity",
    "duals ourselves .",
    "+   + we will first define the model of dilaton gravity and show that its field equations may be matched to the equations of motion we have derived ( [ eomfinal ] ) .",
    "it is a well - studied fact that @xcite a generic dilaton model with at most second order derivatives can be transformed by appropriate redefinitions of the fields and metric into the form @xmath578 = \\int{d^2 x \\sqrt{|g|}\\left ( r\\eta + v(\\eta , l_m ) \\right ) } \\label{jtaction}\\ ] ] where @xmath579 and @xmath145 is the dilaton .",
    "we will , however , be referring to the field @xmath269 as the dilaton for conciseness .",
    "@xmath580 is a functional of both the dilaton and matter content @xmath581 .",
    "the dilaton can be coupled to both the metric and the matter content , ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "+   + several sets of field equations can be derived from this model depending on which degrees of freedom are considered dynamic and which static .",
    "see appendix [ fieldeqapp ] for some of the detailed derivations .",
    "for instance , varying with respect to the dilaton , @xmath269 , yields @xmath582 varying the action ( [ jtaction ] ) with respect to the inverse metric yields @xmath583 we single out the quantity @xmath584 which is an energy momentum tensor .",
    "the field equations can be rewritten after multiplying by @xmath585 and summing over the indices @xmath586 the equation ( [ dilatoneq ] ) is written in this form so that it may be compared easily with the left hand side of ( [ eomfinal ] ) . by comparing ( [ dilatoneq ] ) and ( [ eomfinal ] ) it is clear that we could make a choice for the function @xmath587 that will ensure that the dilaton gravity field equations match the equations of motion of the expectation values of operators .",
    "specifically , we can make a choice for @xmath580 linear in the dilaton i.e. @xmath588 which determines the geometry independent of the dilaton ( [ dilfield ] ) i.e. @xmath589 .",
    "we use the symbol @xmath590 to emphasise that @xmath591 .",
    "@xmath32 is some functional of the matter content .",
    "note that , as before , of the three field equations ( [ dilatoneq ] ) only two are independent .",
    "the energy momentum tensor @xmath592 therefore only contains two independent entries . for this purpose",
    "we use the trace of the energy momentum tensor and the potential ( [ massdefine ] ) @xmath593 .",
    "the energy momentum tensor can be reconstructed from these two quantities .",
    "+   + having now identified dilaton gravity as fitting all our requirements we can proceed with building the quantum mechanics / dilaton gravity dual in two dimensions . before we proceed with this we take note of some important works from the @xmath2 literature .",
    "these will guide our discussions and place our findings into context .",
    "dilaton gravity , and specifically the jackiw - teiltelboim model @xcite , has been studied in a series of works ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) centered around the @xmath2 correspondence .",
    "one of the motivations behind these works is to calculate the entropy of a two - dimensional dilaton gravity black hole by using its @xmath23 dual .",
    "though this calculation can be carried out without the @xmath2 dictionary it serves to show that quantities in @xmath594 dilaton gravity can be calculated from the dual quantum theory . since the conformal group in one and two dimensions is infinite dimensional the @xmath23 and @xmath595 e- and higher - point correlation functions are more restricted @xcite .",
    "these low dimensional examples , where the field theory is comparatively simple , thus provide a good opportunity to study low - dimensional gravity by using its dual theory .",
    "+   + the development of these works is a progressively more refined calculation of the conformal algebra central charge culminating in @xcite with the correct value for the black hole entropy . in this final work",
    "it was identified that the on - shell equations for the asymptotic fluctuations of the dilaton and metric can be matched with the equations of motion for a scale invariant system coupled to a time - dependent quadratic source .",
    "this is the model of cqm discussed in section [ cqmsection ] .",
    "+   + we sketch their calculations and arguments here for the sake of completeness and to later relate it to our framework . to relate it more explicitly we use a choice of coordinates more akin to those used in this thesis .",
    "the model of gravity under consideration is the jt - model of dilaton gravity @xmath578 = \\int{d^2 x \\sqrt{|\\det(g_{\\mu\\nu})|}\\left ( r\\eta + \\frac{4}{k } \\eta \\right)}.    \\label{su11jt}\\ ] ] varying with respect to the dilaton and inverse metric yields the field equations which are of the form ( [ dilfield ] ) and ( [ jtdilmetric ] ) .",
    "the on - shell geometry is thus locally @xmath1 .",
    "however , the dilaton must also be taken into account in the geometry .",
    "in particular the dilaton allows the definition of the potential @xmath568 ( [ massfield ] ) .",
    "the presence of the dilaton now gives rise to three inequivalent solutions of the field equations .",
    "these are labelled @xmath596 , @xmath597 and @xmath598 where the subscript is the sign of @xmath568 .",
    "the reason these solutions are inequivalent is because , firstly , @xmath568 is unaffected by coordinate transformations . secondly , one may rescale the dilaton @xmath599 which yields @xmath600 so that a ( real ) rescaling can change the magnitude but not the sign of @xmath568 .",
    "complex rescalings are not allowed since the dilaton is a real scalar function .",
    "there is thus no legitimate transformation that can map between these three different solutions .",
    "+   + dilaton gravity in two dimensions permits the definition of a two - dimensional black hole , if @xmath568 is positive @xcite . the black hole does not give rise to a curvature singularity but has the same causal structure as a conventional black hole @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the potential @xmath568 we have defined is a normalisation factor away from the black hole mass @xmath601 . for our current analysis",
    "this normalisation is not important but we will show how it may be calculated in section [ dilnorm ] . +   +",

    "the dual dilaton gravity action is thus @xmath641 where @xmath32 must be chosen so as to produce the appropriate energy momentum tensor and is only a functional of matter .",
    "our task is now to find the matter content that would source a desired expectation value .      in the section [ eomsection ]",

    "+   + unlike its two - dimensional counterpart these higher dimensional duals do not resemble many similar works in the literature .",
    "the primary reasons for this are that an @xmath7 geometry can not be achieved and that there are more than one additional dimensions .",
    "the lack of comparable examples in the literature is precisely why this case is not investigated to the same level of detail as its two - dimensional counterpart . for this case we did provide a simple dictionary .",
    "+   + at first glance it may appear as if this construction for the higher dimensions , though possessing a sensible and systematic dictionary , departs from the traditional @xmath5 approach too much to provide insight therein",
    ". however , we showed explicitly that several important metrics , often the starting point of analysis e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , are easily identifiable submanifolds of the khler manifold .",
    "we thus supplemented their study by identifying the quantum states on the boundary explicitly , providing the explicit origins of the extra dimensions and an interpretation for the scalar curvature . in terms of the question of establishing a gravitional dual (",
    "as opposed to just calculating the metrics ) we currently have no answer .",
    "since we lose the khler structure on the submanifold we also lose the dictionary we have developed throughout the rest of the thesis .",
    "we proposed that it is possible that one may utilise the khler dictionary to learn from the dictionary on the submanifold .",

    "this yields a term of the form @xmath808 .",

    "this connection between the complex conformal group and conformal galilei group can already be seen on the level of the relevant wave equations ( for @xmath816 ) , the free schrdinger equation and the free klein - gordon equation .",

    "the equation ( [ schrconf ] ) now becomes @xmath829 which can be identified as the free klein - gordon equation in euclidean flat space , the symmetry generators of which form the conformal algebra .",
    "though this matching of the wavefunction is instructive , we will start our analysis with the @xmath822 algebra in its abstract form and show the subalgebra structure explicitly .",
    "the @xmath830-dimensional conformal algebra consists of @xmath662 translations , @xmath662 lorentz transformations , @xmath54 rotations and one dilitation / scaling .",

    "we will now proceed to classify the elements of the complex conformal algebra in terms of scaling behaviour and show that the @xmath773 algebra can be identified as a subset of a real form of this complex algebra .",
    "we select and complexify one of the rotation operators which , without loss of generality , we choose as @xmath835 . +   + we may now classify the elements of @xmath822 in terms of their scaling with the operators @xmath834 and @xmath836 .",
