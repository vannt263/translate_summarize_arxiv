    "symmetry classification of possible gap structures established the framework for separating conventional superconductors from their unconventional counterparts @xcite .",
    "superconductors with the order parameters that transform according to the trivial irreducible representation of the point symmetry group of the crystal are usually labeled conventional .",
    "if the order parameter transforms according to a non - trivial representation of the same group , the superconductor is called unconventional .    in the latter class",
    "the symmetry of the order parameter is lower than the full group symmetry .",
    "this lowering of symmetry is usually believed to be related to strong repulsive coulomb interactions and specific pairing mechanisms ( for example , due to magnetic fluctuations ) . as a result ,",
    "determining the gap structure is one of the crucial steps in testing our understanding of the origin of superconductivity in a given material .",
    "an important group of unconventional superconductors are those with order parameter that vanishes ( has nodes ) for some directions at the fermi surface .",
    "thermal conductivity is an exceptionally powerful probe for testing the shape of the gap in nodal superconductors since only the unpaired electrons ( with momenta close to the nodal directions ) carry entropy .",
    "the presence or absence of the nodes , and sometimes their type ( point or line ) , can be inferred from the dependence of the thermal conductivity on the magnetic field and temperature .",
    "an additional test for the existence of line nodes is the so - called universality of the low - temperature coefficient of the thermal conductivity , @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the universal behavior refers to the relative insensitivity of @xmath3 to the concentration of the impurity atoms and to the details of the scattering on individual impurity centers @xcite .",
    "physically , since impurity scattering is pairbreaking , it generates near - nodal quasiparticles which can carry heat , and whose lifetime is , in turn , is limited by scattering on the same impurities . for linear nodes",
    "the two effects cancel nearly exactly . in the high - t@xmath4 cuprates , for example",
    ", the quantitative agreement between theoretical estimates of @xmath3 and the measured thermal conductivity was established @xcite . however , determining the location of the nodes in the momentum space from such measurements is much harder .",
    "the most direct tests measure the variation in the heat transport with the orientation of the applied magnetic field with respect to the nodal directions @xcite .",
    "long before such experiments were attempted , it was proposed that the _ anisotropy _ of the thermal conductivity along two different directions as a function of temperature allows to infer information about the gap structure @xcite .",
    "essentially , the measurement determines the predominant direction of the fermi velocity for the nodal quasiparticles .",
    "combined with the knowledge of the fermi surface , measurements of the evolution of the anisotropy in the superconducting state impose stringent constraints on the possible loci of the nodes .",
    "this method was applied to upt@xmath5@xcite , and the results argued convincingly for a line of nodes at @xmath6 .",
    "the main reason this experiment did not uniquely determined the gap structure is that theoretically expected results depend on the detailed shape of the fermi surface and the superconducting gap , i.e. on the basis functions for the particular representation @xcite .",
    "this detail apart , it is believed that the measurement provides a good test for the horizontal vs. vertical linear nodes .",
    "very recently the anisotropy of the thermal conductivity along inequivalent crystalline directions was measured in heavy fermion ceirin@xmath0 by shakeripour et al .",
    "the ratio of the @xmath7-axis to the in - plane thermal conductivity , @xmath8 , rapidly decreases in the superconducting state .",
    "similarity of the anisotropy evolution to that for upt@xmath5 , where equatorial line of nodes is believed to exist , led the authors of ref .   to suggest that the superconducting gap in ceirin@xmath0 also has a horizontal line of nodes .",
    "this is surprising since cecoin@xmath0 , a close relative of ceirin@xmath0 , has vertical lines of nodes @xcite , and the prevailing belief is that the two compounds are quite similar ( although some evidence points to different origin of superconductivity in the two systems @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , in this paper we re - visit the analysis of the temperature dependence and the anisotropy of the thermal conductivity in nodal superconductors . since both de haas - van alphen measurements , and band structure calculations show that ceirin@xmath0 has an open , quasi - two dimensional piece of the fermi surface with significant @xmath9-electron contribution @xcite , our main focus here is on such anisotropic systems .",
    "we discuss the implications of the measurements for the symmetry of the order parameter , and compare the anisotropy of the thermal conductivity for several models relevant not only to ceirin@xmath0 , but also to other systems with a quasi - two dimensional fermi surface .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in next section",
    "we introduce the basic experimental facts and theoretical considerations , formulating the models .",
    "the subsequent sections are devoted to the analysis of the proposed models .",
    "we then critically compare our results with experiment , and propose further measurements to test the gap symmetry in ceirin@xmath0 .",
    "ceirin@xmath0 is a member of the so called 115 series , which also include cecoin@xmath0 and cerhin@xmath0 . while in the rh system the @xmath9-electrons of ce remain localized and undergo antiferromagnetic ordering , both ir and co compounds are paramagnetic heavy fermion metals . in both systems",
    "de haas - van alphen measurements and the band structure calculations indicate that a major sheet of the fermi surface is quasi - two dimensional , although the energy dispersion along the @xmath7-axis is substantial , as evidenced by a very moderate anisotropy ( @xmath10 ) between the out of plane and in - plane normal state transport coefficients .",
    "in contrast to cecoin@xmath0 , which is a highly unconventional metal , likely close to a quantum critical point at finite magnetic field @xcite , ceirin@xmath0 near the superconducting phase is a good fermi liquid , and therefore its excitations should be adequately described by the calculations in the fermi - liquid framework .",
    "both ceirin@xmath0 and cecoin@xmath0 are ambient pressure superconductors , and knight shift measurements indicate singlet pairing @xcite .",
    "specific heat and in - plane thermal conductivity measurements @xcite , as well as penetration depth @xcite and spin - lattice relaxation rate @xcite , show the existence of line nodes .",
    "in cecoin@xmath0 there is overwhelming evidence for the vertical line nodes from the anisotropy of the thermal conductivity and specific heat under rotated magnetic field @xcite , and from the tunneling into the andreev bound states @xcite . given the strong similarities between the fermi surfaces it is tempting to conclude that the gap structure is similar in the two materials .",
    "there is , however , evidence pointing towards differences in the origin ( and hence possibly in the type ) of the superconducting state of the co and ir compounds @xcite .",
    "authors of ref .",
    "measured the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity in ceirin@xmath0 along two inequivalent crystalline directions , @xmath11 ( out of plane ) and @xmath12 ( in plane ) , and made two significant observations : a ) the ratio @xmath13 is nearly temperature - independent above the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath14 , but is rapidly reduced with @xmath1 at @xmath15 ( note that inelastic scattering yields a peak in thermal conductivity just below @xmath16 k , which may lead to the decrease of @xmath17 appearing very pronounced ) ; b ) the low @xmath1 limit of the in - plane @xmath18 appears universal , but the interplane @xmath19 does not show the universal limit . our goal below is to examine the possible origin and implications of this result .",
    "independently of the choice of theoretical model , the results a ) and b ) above imply , prima facie , that the effect of superconductivity on the quasiparticles with the fermi velocity predominantly in the plane is different from that for the quasiparticles moving along the c - axis : the states that carry entropy along the @xmath7-axis have a larger `` effective gap '' than those carrying heat current in the plane . several processes of different physical origin may lead to this behavior . in the following",
    "we do not consider inelastic scattering ; this is appropriate at low temperatures , @xmath20 . the range of temperatures in ref .   where the inelastic scattering can be neglected is not immediately clear from the data , note , however , that , if the inelastic scattering is isotropic , our conclusions regarding the anisotropy of the thermal transport are not affected .",
    "since the fermi surface of ceirin@xmath0 has several sheets , it is , of course , possible that the multiband effects are responsible for the observed behavior .",
    "however , without a microscopic theory detailing the gaps on each of the sheets , reaching reliable conclusions about the agreement between theory and experiment seems impossible , while phenomenological multiband theory has too many fitting parameters to seriously constrain possible gap structures .",
    "we aim to construct a minimal model that captures the essential physics of the the experimental observations , and therefore restrict ourselves to considering one electronic band .",
    "since most band structure and dhva analyses suggest an important role of the quasi - two dimensional ( open along the @xmath7-axis ) band , we choose such a band for our approach .",
    "we approximate it by a simple nearest neighbor tight binding expression @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the components of the quasiparticle momentum , @xmath23 , @xmath7 is the lattice spacing in the @xmath24 direction , @xmath25 is the effective mass , and @xmath26 is the interplane tunneling matrix element . in all but one of our models",
    "we take @xmath26 to be momentum - independent .",
    "we show below however , that the model with @xmath27-dependent interplane tunneling that provides a viable path towards explaining the experimental results , even with the assumption of vertical , rather than horizontal , nodes .",
    "we consider singlet order parameters , and begin with the simple model of vertical line nodes similar to the order parameter in cecoin@xmath0 , introducing the azimuthal in - plane angle @xmath28 ,    * * model a : * @xmath29 , and + @xmath30 .",
    "we show in the next section that this model is incompatible with the experimental observations . physically , the fermi surface is cylindrically symmetric and the gap depends only on the azimuthal angle , @xmath31 , while the @xmath24-axis component of the fermi velocity is @xmath31-independent . as we show below in sec .",
    "[ sec : a ] , these conditions ensure that the ratio @xmath32 , is temperature - independent even in the superconducting state .",
    "this constraint needs to be relaxed to explain the experimental results , and we consider several possible models .",
    "first , we show that for a tight - binding fermi surface it can be expected , from microscopic considerations , that the gap also acquires a weak modulation along the @xmath7-direction , while retaining vertical lines of nodes , and therefore consider    * * model b : * @xmath29 , and + @xmath33 .",
    "while in this model there exists a temperature - dependent anisotropy , we find that this dependence is generally weak , and hence unlikely to provide a satisfactory explanation of the experimental observations ( although we can not exclude it ) .    in the second approach to lifting the constraints of model",
    "a we consider a situation with vertical line nodes , but where the nodal quasiparticles are less efficient than the normal electrons ( on average ) in transporting heat along the @xmath7-axis compared to the @xmath34 plane . to model",
    "this we note that the measured and calculated fermi surface of ceirin@xmath0 is not rotationally symmetric @xcite , and that the energy dispersion of the electrons along the @xmath24-axis clearly depends on the direction of the in - plane momentum .",
    "this dependence is expected in the @xmath35 symmetry , and @xmath26 is determined by the structure of the overlapping wave functions for the quasi - two dimensional band .",
    "we therefore introduce the angle dependence into the interplane tunneling , preserving the crystal symmetry in the plane , and propose    * * model c : * @xmath36 , and + @xmath30 .    for @xmath37",
    "the interplane tunneling is smaller for the nodal quasiparticles than for antinodal ones , which ensures the @xmath1-dependence of the anisotropy ratio .",
    "the situation is somewhat reminiscent of that in the high - t@xmath4 cuprates where , in the absence of orthorhombic distortion , the interplane tunneling of the nodal quasiparticles is suppressed , i.e. @xmath38 @xcite , and therefore the observed temperature dependence of the josephson plasma resonance frequency @xcite and the @xmath7-axis penetration depth @xcite is different from that suggested by the simple density of states power counting .",
    "we show that such a model gives a significant temperature - dependent anisotropy of the thermal conductivity .",
    "finally , we consider a model with horizontal , rather than vertical line nodes , similar to the hybrid @xmath39 gap proposed for upt@xmath5 , with broken time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the basis function of the representation is described as @xmath40 . for open fermi surface",
    "we require periodicity along the @xmath24-direction , and the appropriate basis function is @xmath41 .",
    "the excitation spectrum and the thermal conductivity are only sensitive to the gap amplitude , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 .",
    "since our consideration of model b shows ( see the analysis below ) that weak modulation does not change the anisotropy qualitatively , we ignore it , and consider    * * model d : * @xmath29 , and + @xmath44 .    we show that , this model also gives a substantially temperature - dependent ratio @xmath45 .",
    "moreover , we point out that from the data of ref .   it is impossible to distinguish model c from model d , and suggest further measurements to probe the gap structure in ceirin@xmath0 .",
    "we are now ready to consider each model in detail . in order to make connection with experiment , we largely focus on the thermal conductivity and its anisotropy @xmath46 we begin by briefly looking at the normal state properties .",

    "a conventional superconductor with a spherical fermi surface strongly prefers a fully isotropic gap , while a strongly anisotropic quasi two - dimensional system with a circular fermi surface and the dominant pairing in the @xmath100 channel is likely to have the gap with the @xmath101 momentum dependence .",
