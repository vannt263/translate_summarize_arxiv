    "the purpose of this note is to initiate a study of generalized torsion in classical knot groups . for two elements @xmath1 and @xmath2 of a group , we use the notation @xmath3 for the conjugate of @xmath1 by @xmath2 and @xmath4 : = x^{-1}y^{-1}xy$ ] for their commutator .",
    "the identity of a group is denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "a _ generalized torsion _ element of a group is an element @xmath6 for which some ( nonempty finite ) product of conjugates of that element is the identity : @xmath7    [ klein ] an example of generalized torsion is the fundamental group of the klein bottle @xmath8 in which @xmath1 is a generalized torsion element : @xmath9",
    "a classical knot is a subset @xmath10 of euclidean space @xmath11 which is abstractly homeomorphic to the circle @xmath12 .",
    "we assume @xmath10 is smooth or piecewise linear .",
    "the _ knot group _ of @xmath10 is the fundamental group of its complement : @xmath13 .",
    "it has long been known that knot groups do not contain torsion , that is , elements of finite order .",
    "in fact , knot groups have the stronger property of being locally indicable : every nontrivial finitely - generated subgroup surjects to @xmath14 , the integers ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "it follows that knot groups support left - invariant orderings , meaning that the elements of the group can be given a total ordering @xmath15 such that for elements @xmath16 of the group one has @xmath17 .",
    "the groups of some knots , for example @xmath18 , are bi - orderable : there is a strict total ordering of the elements which is invariant under multiplication on both sides ( see @xcite ) .",
    "but not all knot groups are bi - orderable ; generalized torsion is a well - known obstruction to bi - orderability .",
    "the following is clear , for if we assume without loss that @xmath19 in a bi - ordering , then all its conjugates are also greater than the identity , so @xmath20 .",
    "[ bi - ordnogentors ] bi - orderable groups do not have generalized torsion elements .    although left - orderable groups can not have torsion ,",
    "they can have generalized torsion  the klein bottle group of example [ klein ] is an instance : in fact it has exactly four left - orderings",
    ". as we ll see , many knot groups are also examples .    among the various reasons bi - orderability of a knot group",
    "is of interest is the following result of @xcite .",
    "if the group of the knot @xmath10 is bi - orderable , then surgery on @xmath10 can not produce a 3-manifold with finite fundamental group , or more generally any l - space in the sense of ozsvth and szab @xcite .",
    "[ ex : trefoil ] consider the group of the trefoil knot @xmath21 .",
    "the commutator @xmath22 $ ] is a nontrivial element , because @xmath23 is non - abelian . but",
    "@xmath24x[x , y ] = x^{-2}y^{-1}xyxx^{-1}y^{-1}xy = x^{-2}y^{-1}x^2y = y^{-3}y^{-1}y^3y = 1.$ ] so @xmath22 $ ] is a generalized torsion element in the knot group of the trefoil .",
    "this is expanded in theorem [ torus group ] below for other torus knots  that is , knots that can be inscribed on the surface of an unknotted solid torus in @xmath11 .",
    "the following lemma is a standard fact of group theory , easily proved by induction using the identities @xmath25 = [ x^{n-1},y]^x[x , y]$ ] and @xmath26 = [ x , y][x , y^{n-1}]^y$ ] .",
    "its relation to orderability is pointed out in @xcite , examples 2.1 and 2.2 , which also inspired the remaining results of this section .",

    "proposition [ proposition : commuting ] completes the proof .    if @xmath31 and @xmath32 are relatively prime integers , @xmath36 is the group of the @xmath37-torus knot ( two examples pictured below ) .",
    "the group of a nontrivial torus knot has generalized torsion .",
    "let us consider the nontrivial prime knots up to six crossings , in their usual tabulated order :    @xmath38 : the trefoil , or @xmath39torus knot .",
    "its group has generalized torsion as observed in example [ ex : trefoil ] .",
    "@xmath18 : the figure - eight knot .",
    "it has group @xmath40 .",
    "its alexander polynomial , @xmath41 , has real positive roots .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that its group is bi - orderable using that fact , and that @xmath18 is a fibred knot ( see below for definition ) . hence no generalized torsion .",
    "@xmath42 : the @xmath43torus knot or cinquefoil .",
    "generalized torsion here by theorem [ torus group ] .",
    "all the above knots are fibred knots ; that is , their complements in @xmath44 fibre over @xmath12 with fibres being open surfaces whose closure has the knot as its boundary .",
    "@xmath0 : we ll see this knot s group also has generalized torsion .",
    "the knot @xmath0 is the first knot in the standard table which is not fibred .",
    "it has alexander polynomial @xmath45 , whereas fibred knots have _ monic _ polynomials .",
    "its knot group @xmath46 has presentation @xmath47 it is shown in @xcite that @xmath46 is not bi - orderable using the fact that the alexander polynomial has no real roots . in this note",
    "we strengthen this result by noting there is generalized torsion in @xmath46 .",
    "[ 5_2 ] in the group @xmath46 , @xmath48 is a generalized torsion element .",
    "this will be proved in the next section .",
    "the knot in the tables which follows @xmath0 is sometimes known as the `` stevedore knot '' ...",
    "@xmath49 : this knot has alexander polynomial @xmath50 , whose roots are @xmath51 and 2 . according to @xcite , using results of @xcite , the group of this knot is bi - orderable .",
    "therefore its group does not have generalized torsion .",
    "the next knot in the tables is still a mystery ...",
    "@xmath52 : this is the first knot in the tables for which bi - orderability , as well as the existence of generalized torsion , is unknown at this writing .",
    "its alexander polynomial is @xmath53 , which has two positive real roots @xmath54 and @xmath55 and two complex roots , approximately @xmath56 .",
    "the last prime knot with at most six crossings is    @xmath57 : its alexander polynomial is @xmath58 which has no real roots . using this fact , it is shown in @xcite , again using results of @xcite , that the group of this knot is not bi - orderable .",
    "we do not know if its group contains generalized torsion .",
    "we adopt the convention of using capital letters to denote the inverse of a group element , so that the defining relation of the group @xmath46 becomes @xmath59 .",
    "the existence of generalized torsion in this group was discovered with the help of a python program written by the first named author to test for bi - orderability . the first proof we offer",
    "is adapted from the non - bi - orderability argument discovered by computer , and seems rather unmotivated .",
    "we will also present a second proof , suggested by andrew glass , which the reader may find somewhat more mathematically satisfying .",
    "first we need to argue that @xmath60 is not the identity .",
    "but this follows since the group , like all groups of nontrivial knots , is nonabelian .",
    "let @xmath61 denote the set of elements of @xmath46 which are ( nonempty ) products of conjugates of @xmath60 .",
    "our goal is to show that @xmath62 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath61 is closed under multiplication and conjugation , and of course : @xmath63 now @xmath64",
    "so @xmath65 conjugating @xmath60 by @xmath66 shows that @xmath67 now consider the product of ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) : @xmath68 which is equal to @xmath69 by the following calculation .",
    "@xmath70 here we used the relation @xmath71 , which follows from the defining relation .",
    "so we have shown @xmath72 conjugating ( 4 ) gives @xmath73 this last expression equals @xmath74 from the calculation @xmath75 so we conclude @xmath76 another conjugate of ( 4 ) gives @xmath77 so @xmath78 next we conjugate ( 1 ) : @xmath79 so that @xmath80 multiplying those last two elements of @xmath61 yields @xmath81 : @xmath82 similarly the product of ( 2 ) and ( 5 ) gives @xmath83 @xmath84 finally , conjugate ( 9 ) by @xmath85 and multiply by ( 8) to conclude @xmath86    _ second proof .",
    "_ we are interested in showing that @xmath87 $ ] is a generalized torsion element in the @xmath0 knot group .",
    "obviously , if we re to have a hope , we d better look at products of conjugates of @xmath88 by elements of the form @xmath89 where @xmath90 are small .",
    "note that @xmath91 $ ] and @xmath92 $ ] . since @xmath93 ( one form of the defining relation )",
    ", we obtain @xmath94 .",
    "hence @xmath95 .",
    "now @xmath96 $ ] , so @xmath97 ( using @xmath98 ) .",
    "so we can conclude that @xmath99 .",
    "thus one product of conjugates of @xmath88 is the inverse of another product of conjugates of @xmath88 , so @xmath88 is a generalized torsion element .",
    "satellites of knots are constructed as follows .",
    "let @xmath10 be a knot in the interior of a solid torus @xmath100 which in turn is standardly embedded in @xmath11 ; that is , @xmath100 is a regular neighbourhood of the trivial knot .",
    "we assume that @xmath10 is essential in @xmath100 , in the sense that the inclusion induces an _ injective _ homomorphism @xmath101 now let @xmath102 be some other knot in @xmath11 with tubular neighbourhood @xmath103 .",
    "since @xmath103 is a solid torus , there is a homeomorphism @xmath104  in fact there are infinitely many isotopy classes of such homeomorphisms .",
    "finally , we let @xmath105 ; it is itself a knot in @xmath11 . in this situation",
    ", we say that @xmath106 is a _ satellite _ of @xmath102 with _ pattern _ knot @xmath10 . by a van kampen argument",
    ", one can see that the group of @xmath102 is isomorphic with a subgroup of the group of @xmath106 .",
    "this implies the following .",
    "if @xmath106 is a _ satellite _ of @xmath102 and the knot group of @xmath102 has generalized torsion , then the same is true of the group of @xmath106 .",
    "if one of the knots in a connected sum of knots has generalized torsion in its group , then the same is true of the sum .",
    "this follows since a connected sum of two knots can be viewed as a satellite of either of the summands .",
    "algebraic knots in the sense of milnor @xcite have generalized torsion in their groups .",
    "this is because they are iterated cables of the unknot , and therefore a satellite of a torus knot .",
    "there exist knots with trivial alexander polynomial whose group contains generalized torsion .",
    "for example , consider whitehead doubles of knots with generalized torsion ( see @xcite p. 167 , or @xcite )",
    ". if they are `` untwisted '' they have trivial polynomial , but being satellites they inherit generalized torsion in their groups .",
    "untwisted double of the trefoil .",
    "it has trivial alexander polynomial , but there is generalized torsion in its group .",
    "the following shows that the alexander polynomial can not detect the nonexistence of generalized torsion .    for any knot @xmath10",
    ", there exists another knot with the same alexander polynomial as @xmath10 , but whose group contains generalized torsion .",
    "just take the connected sum of @xmath10 with , say , the doubled trefoil above .",
    "it is known that for nontrivial knots which are fibred @xcite , or which have one - relator presentations of a particular form @xcite , if the alexander polynomial has no positive real roots then the knot group is not bi - orderable .",
    "this begs the following question .",
    "if @xmath10 is a knot whose alexander polynomial is nontrivial and has no real positive roots , does it follow that the group of @xmath10 contains generalized torsion ?",
    "in summary , we have seen that all nontrivial torus knots , as well as the hyperbolic knot @xmath0 , have generalized torsion in their groups . moreover , possessing generalized torsion in the group is preserved under taking satellites .    in all the cases we have discussed ,",
    "the generalized torsion element identified in the knot group is a commutator in appropriate generators . since for any knot group",
    "@xmath23 the abelianization is infinite cyclic , any generalized torsion element must be in the kernel of the abelianization map @xmath107 , in other words , the commutator subgroup . that it is a _ single _ commutator in all these cases is interesting .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the two knot groups , for @xmath18 and @xmath0 .",
    "the latter can be rewritten , exchanging @xmath108 with its inverse , so that we have @xmath109 curiously , the latter has generalized torsion while @xmath110 does not .    from @xcite we have infinitely many knots whose groups are bi - orderable , namely fibred knots whose alexander polynomial has all roots real and positive",
    ". these knot groups can not contain generalized torsion by proposition [ bi - ordnogentors ] .",
    "although this is an infinite class , it does not seem to be proportionately large .",
    "there are certainly many ( most ) knots for which bi - orderability of its group is an open question .",
    "the same is true of generalized torsion ."
