    "a pin photodiode is a very useful device .",
    "it is used not just for a photosensor but also for a detector of charged particles , x - rays and gamma - rays by a lot of experiments in high energy physics .",
    "a pin photodiode is an improved version of the low - capacitance planar silicon photodiode and makes use of an extra high resistivity intrinsic silicon layer between a p- and an n@xmath1-layer to improve response time .",
    "reversed bias enhances response time of the pin photodiode .",
    "it has high resistance to breakdown and low leakage current .",
    "we use pin photodiodes for an x - ray detector in the search experiment for solar axions ( the tokyo axion helioscope ( fig . [ sumico ] ) @xcite @xcite ) , because of a low sensitivity to magnetic fields , tolerance to low - temperature , and high efficiency for low energy x - rays @xcite .    however , it has a slight disadvantage .",
    "there is non - active area so - called ` a dead layer ' which consists of the sio@xmath2 layer formed on the detector surface as a protective film and the p - layer on a pin photodiode .",
    "but these layers do not perform as depleted layers .",
    "they have no sensitivity .",
    "it could worsen the sensitivity to low energy x - rays in our experiment . in @xcite",
    ", we reported that the thickness was @xmath3 at 95% confidence level .",
    "but we thought the true value was much less than this one .    in this work",
    ", we determined the thickness of the insensitive surface layer of the pin photodiode to recalculate the upper limit of axion - photon coupling constant using the data obtained in our earlier experiments @xcite @xcite .",
    "to measure the thickness of the insensitive surface layer , we made alpha - particles from an @xmath4am source impinge on a pin photodiode at various incidence angles .",
    "the range for the 5.486 mev alpha - particle in silicon is @xmath5 and much less than the thickness of the expected depleted layer .",
    "respective path lengths of alpha - particles in the insensitive and sensitive layers depend on their incidence angle .",
    "therefore , it enables us to estimate the thickness of the insensitive layer measuring pulse heights of alpha - particles in the pin photodiode as a function of the incidence angle .",
    "the experimental setup is shown in figs .",
    "@xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the experimental apparatus were put in a vacuum ( pressure less than 10@xmath9 pa ) .",
    "we could rotate the pin photodiode from the outside of the vacuum to change the incidence angle .",
    "the pin photodiode was exposed to 5.486 mev alpha - particles from the @xmath4am source installed in a brass holder .",
    "the brass holder had a stainless steel pipe of @xmath104.3 mm inner diameter and 50 mm length as a collimator .",
    "the distance between the source and the detector is 60 mm .",
    "the pin photodiode we used is hamamatsu s3590 - 06 .",
    "it is 11@xmath1111 mm@xmath12 in size and 500 @xmath13 m in thickness .",
    "this pin photodiode is the same type as ones used in the tokyo axion helioscope @xcite@xcite .",
    "it has high efficiency to x - rays of energies up to 10 kev , energy range of x - rays to which solar axions convert in magnetic fields .",
    "we measured spectra for 8 incidence angles , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] ) .",
    "each spectrum in fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] exhibits peaks of 5.486 mev around 2900 ch .",
    "the alpha - particle peak channels shifted lower with increasing incidence angles , suggesting an existence of the insensitive surface layer .",
    "we determined the peak channel @xmath16 by fitting a gaussian function to spectrum of the incidence angle @xmath17 . in the fitting",
    ", we use the upper half region of each peak , because the lower half contained the effect of the thickness of the @xmath4am source and the spread of incidence angles of alpha - particles .",
    "@xmath18 shows the relation between the peak channels @xmath16 and incidence angles @xmath17 together with the best fit to the data by the equation , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the thickness of the insensitive layer of the pin photodiode , @xmath21 is the energy of alpha - particles of @xmath4am , @xmath22 is the stopping power , the insensitive layer for the alpha - particles , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are parameters of the relation between channels and energies ; @xmath25}= \\alpha ( c\\;{\\rm [ ch ] } -\\beta).\\ ] ] since we do not know the percentage of si and sio@xmath2 in the insensitive layer , we calculated the thickness for the case it consisted of si and the case of sio@xmath2 . the stopping power of sio@xmath2 is a little larger than that of si , therefore , the estimate value of the thickness is a little smaller . in the fitting ,",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath24 were left free and @xmath23 was fixed at 2.24 .",
    "this value was determined by calibration with alpha - particles from @xmath4am in vacuum and decelerated alpha - particles from the same source in the air .",
    "thereby we got @xmath26 with @xmath27 for si and 13% smaller for sio@xmath2 .",
    "at worst , in the case that the insensitive layer consisted of si , the thickness is less than @xmath28 at 95% confidence level .",
    "this is nearly @xmath29 of the value we conservatively assumed before @xcite .",
    "if the insensitive layer were relatively thick as we supposed before , then the detection efficiency for the x - ray would be largely affected by absorption in it .",
    "however , it is not the case because the insensitive layer is thin enough , less than 15% of the absorption length for 5 kev x - rays .",
    "however , one still has to take into account loss of energy caused by escape of x - rays and auger electrons from the detector following photoelectric absorption of the incoming x - ray .",
    "a monte carlo simulation was performed to estimate the peak detection efficiency for x - rays of energy range between 2 kev and 10 kev with the geant4 program @xcite . in the simulation we assumed that the insensitive layer consists of si .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ simulation ] .",
    "the errors for the estimation are too small to show on the data points .",
    "the estimated peak detection efficiency is more than 95% in the energy range between 4 and 10 kev .",
    "the decreasing efficiency toward low energy is due to the absorption in the insensitive layer and lower efficiency above 9 kev is caused by the insufficiency of the thickness of the depletion layer .",
    "even if we simulated on the assumption that the insensitive layer consisted of sio@xmath2 , the result did not change significantly .",
    "= 6.8 cm = 6.8 cm",
    "we showed the thickness of an insensitive layer of a pin photodiode , s3590 - 06 produced by hamamatsu , is @xmath0 for si or 13% smaller for sio@xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the upper limit of the thickness is @xmath30 at 95% confidence level in the case of the insensitive layer consisted entirely of si .",
    "we calculated the peak efficiency of a pin photodiode for x - rays in consideration of the thickness of the insensitive layer and escape of x - rays and auger electrons from the detector .",
    "this result showed the efficiency as more than 95% for 4 - 10 kev x - rays , which correspond to the energy range observed in the tokyo axion helioscope experiment @xcite @xcite .",
