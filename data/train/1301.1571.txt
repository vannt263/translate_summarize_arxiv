    "fig.[fig7 ] ) done in the previous section is in excellent qualitative agreement with the disclination - unbinding transition for the hexatic and fluid phases .",
    "+ the results of the kosterlitz - thouless theory for the @xmath108 model and coulomb gas in two dimensions can be used for the disclination - unbinding transition , the hexatic / fluid transition . in the @xmath108 model",
    ", the correlation length has an essential singularity as in eq.([kt_sing ] ) @xcite .",
    "all quantities related to the correlation length exhibit the same kt essential singularity at the transition , for the @xmath1-ocp monolayer , kt - singularities are found for : the bond orientational order parameters @xmath77 ( fig.[fig4 ] ( a ) ) , the susceptibility @xmath57 ( fig.[fig4](b ) and fig.[fig6](d ) ) and correlations lengths @xmath33 and @xmath59 ( fig.[fig4](c , d ) ) .",
    "the transition temperatures @xmath52 or coupling constants @xmath53 found by fitting the kt - singularities of these quantities agree well and permit to locate the hexatic / fluid transition for several values of the power @xmath1 of inverse power law interaction of eq.([iplpot ] ) .",
    "these results are reported on table [ table1 ] . as shown also in the previous section",
    ", the kosterlitz - thouless essential singularities can be very well studied with the multiple histogram method ; additional computations with different sizes and others values of @xmath1 are ongoing .",
    "these results for @xmath6 are in excellent agreement with the ktnhy theory for the disclination - unbinding transition , they agree also with previous experimental @xcite and numerical @xcite studies .",
    "+ in the present work , as @xmath1 is a continuous parameter in the ipl potential , we have been able to obtain empirical transition curves for both solid / hexatic and hexatic / fluid transition for @xmath6 .",
    "these curves are given by eqs.([meanfield],[fit_gamma ] ) in sect.iii and they are represented on fig.[fig1](a ) in the plane @xmath64 .",
    "this phase diagram is extremely useful to locate the hexatic phase for a given @xmath1 and to choose the range of numerical values for the surface density @xmath46 , the temperature @xmath51 or the coupling constant @xmath66 in numerical computations that one has to use to observe the hexatic phase , this is necessary to study in detail the properties of the hexatic phase and of the hexatic / solid transition since the range in the coupling constant @xmath66 for which one can observe an hexatic phase is very thin for almost all values of @xmath163 .",
    "it is the reason for which , we consider the results obtained in this work as preliminary results for a longer study of the hexatic phase in the @xmath1-ocp monolayers .",
    "obviously , the accuracy of the transition curves reported in sect.iii , and the @xmath164 parameters given in table [ table1 ] , will be improved by adding data obtained with other values of @xmath1 .",
    "+ for @xmath165 , we found that the transition curves cross at @xmath166 , making @xmath167 , and computations done at constant surface density and temperature ( runs a and b - fig.[fig1 ] ) indicate that the melting would not follow the kthny theory for @xmath168 .",
    "the transition curves given in sect.iii do not permit to reproduce to a correct accuracy the data obtained in runs a and b for @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "however , the finite size analysis of the fourth order cumulants using subsystems and some double peaked histograms of the bond orientational order parameters observed for @xmath171 may support the assumption that the melting becomes a first order transition .",
    "nevertheless , we are not yet able to reach a definitive conclusion about the nature of the melting for @xmath172 and more computations are needed for these values of @xmath1 .",
    "+ the recent results on the hard disks systems described by e.p . bernard and w. krauth @xcite ,",
    "show that for @xmath12 the melting would be described by a first order fluid / hexatic transition followed by a second order hexatic / solid transition .",
    "these results do not agree neither with the kthny theory , nor with the grain - boundary induced melting proposed by chui .",
    "however , these results might find a nice interpretation with the help of the theory of the melting based on isostructural critical points @xcite in which a first order transition between the fluid and hexatic phases is plausible @xcite ; this theory has also to be taken into account for studies with large but finite @xmath1 .",
    "+ the empirical transition curves for @xmath6 and the excellent qualitative and semi - quantitative agreements with the kthny theory found for the melting of @xmath1-ocp monolayers with @xmath6 are the main results of the present work .",
