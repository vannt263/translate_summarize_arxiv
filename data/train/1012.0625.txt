    "classical novae are thermonuclear runaway explosion , which occurs in a hydrogen - rich envelope of a white dwarf accreting matters from a donor star in a binary system @xcite .",
    "the donor star is often a main - sequence star or red giant , which fills its roche lobe .",
    "however , when the donor is an mass - losing evolved star detached from the roche lobe , the nova shock interacts with the preexisting cool envelope of the donor and causes various complex phenomena ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the symbiotic star system v407 cyg was found in nova outburst on 2010 march 10 .",
    "the donor star in this system is known to be a mira [ an evolved star at the asymptotic giant branch ( abg ) phase of stellar evolution ] with a period of the optical light curve of @xmath3 d @xcite .",
    "the long pulsation period suggests that it is relatively luminous compared with typical optical miras in the galactic disk with a period of about 300400 d ( for example , see @xcite ) .",
    "this star is classified to a d - type symbiotic star due to dust - richness in the mira envelope @xcite .",
    "a summary of optical observations at the time of 2010 march nova outburst is found in the american association of variable star observers ( aavso ) web page .",
    "the radio continuum has been detected at various frequencies from 80 ghz down to 1.4 ghz @xcite .",
    "a probable detection of @xmath4 ray was also reported @xcite .",
    "sio maser lines have previously been detected in the envelope of the mira in this system @xcite . in general , sio masers are emitted in a circumstellar envelope at a few stellar radii ( @xmath5 cm ) of the agb star photosphere .",
    "if we assume the expansion velocity of the nova outburst to be 1000 km s@xmath6 , the shock propagates through the sio masing region in a time scale of 12 days .",
    "the line profile of sio maser emission is expected to vary after the nova outburst in this time scale , in which the time variation of the line profile can feasibly be monitored .",
    "therefore , if we assume the maser emission is terminated due to the passage of a shock front over the masing region , we can tail the propagation of the shock wave by monitoring the maser line profile",
    ". vlbi ( very long baseline interferometry ) observations may directly image the interaction of the shock with the neutral gas in the mira envelope . in this paper , we present single - dish monitoring of variation of sio maser line profiles in v407 cyg after the nova outburst in 2010 march .",
    "the `` classical '' nova phenomenon was observed for the first time in the sio maser line in the present research .",
    "the monitoring observation of v407 cyg was started with the nobeyama 45-m telescope first on 2010 march 16 , in 6 days after the discovery of the nova outburst . since then , we monitored the object in the sio maser lines ( @xmath00 , @xmath1 and 2 ) at 43.122 and 42.821 ghz , respectively , once in every few days in the initial phase , and almost once in every week at the later phase till the end of 2010 may .",
    "the half - power full beam width ( hpfbw ) of the telescope was about 40@xmath7 at 43 ghz .",
    "we used a cooled hemt receiver ( h40 ) giving @xmath8 180250 k and acousto - optical spectrometers with high ( 40 khz ; aos - h ) and low ( 250 khz ; aos - w ) resolutions having 2048 channels each .",
    "the spectrometers aos - h and aos - w covered velocity ranges of @xmath9 km s@xmath6 and @xmath10 km s@xmath6 with an effective velocity resolution of 0.3 and 1.8 km s@xmath6 per binned channel , respectively .",
    "the conversion factor of the antenna temperature ( @xmath11 ) to the flux density was @xmath12 jy k@xmath6 .",
    "the typical on - source integration time for these observations was about 10 minutes .",
    "the telescope pointing was checked at the beginning of observations using iras 21086 + 5238 , a strong nearby sio maser source .",
    "the peak intensities of this sio maser source are approximately 3.7 and 5.9 k for the sio @xmath00 @xmath1 and @xmath2 lines , respectively ( in the later phase , the @xmath1 line intensity increased to 4.5 k , but the @xmath2 intensity stayed almost the same ) .",
    "because the sio maser intensity of the above pointing source was always confirmed to be nearly constant , we believe that the intensity calibration of the v407 cyg at 43 ghz using the chopper - wheel method was made properly and the uncertainty of the intensity scale is estimated to be approximately @xmath13 percent throughout the period of observations .",
    "the spectrometer arrays also covered the sio @xmath00 @xmath14 and @xmath15 lines at 43.424 ghz and 42.519 ghz , respectively , the @xmath16sio @xmath00 @xmath14 line at 42.880 ghz , and h53@xmath17 at 42.952 ghz .",
    "however , none of these lines were detected through all the observations in 2010 .",
    "the rms noise levels for these lines are similar to those of the sio @xmath00 , @xmath1 and 2 lines .",
    "in addition to the 43 ghz observations , we tried to detect the sio @xmath181 @xmath1 and 2 lines at 86.243 ghz and 85.640 ghz , respectively , and the @xmath16sio @xmath181 @xmath14 line at 85.759 ghz , with an sis - mixer receiver ( t100 ) on 2010 march 20 and april 26 , but none of them were detected .",
    "we also attempted to detect the h@xmath19o @xmath20@xmath21 maser line at 22.235 ghz on 2010 march 16 and march 20 using the hemt receiver ( h22 ) , resulting no detection .",

    "the @xmath00 @xmath1 line is considerably weaker than the @xmath00 @xmath2 line.0 @xmath1 line using the aos - w spectrometer , which has a larger band width ( 0.25 mhz ; @xmath25 km s@xmath6 ) . ] because the profile of the @xmath00 @xmath1 line is less certain in the high resolution spectrum of aos - h , we discuss only the variation of the @xmath00 @xmath2 line in later sections .",
    "it is notable that only the higher - velocity components ( @xmath26 km s@xmath6 ) in the @xmath2 line were detectable on march 16 .",
    "figure 2 shows the time variation of the @xmath00 @xmath2 line profiles over 2.5 months since the nova outburst .",
    "for the first two weeks ( till march 22 ) , the higher - velocity components on the red - shifted side had been seen .",
    "the higher - velocity components are progressively weakened , showing a minor change in the profiles as time advances .",
    "for example , the sharp peak observed on march 16 at @xmath27 km s@xmath6 was not seen in the later spectra .",
    "then , new peaks appeared on the low - velocity side ( @xmath28 km s@xmath6 ) after march 22 , though these peaks could not be seen temporarily on april 6 ( presumably due to a noise ) .",
    "after april 11 , the low velocity component at @xmath29 km s@xmath6 maintained nearly the same intensity , and also maintained almost the same radial velocity till may 16 , though the peak velocity moved a little to the higher - velocity direction on may 25 . also the emission which tailed on the higher - velocity side of @xmath29 km s@xmath6 appeared from april 19",
    "this tailed emission increased in intensity , and then split into two peaks on may 25 .",
    "( 130mm,200mm)fig2.eps    the intensity - weighted average of the radial velocity of the sio @xmath00 @xmath1 and 2 lines is usually a good indicator of a stellar velocity ( e.g. , @xcite ) for evolved stars with sio maser emission .",
    "however , since v407 cyg shows a double - peak profile , which is different from a typical sio maser source , the intensity - weighted velocity does not seem to be a reliable probe of stellar velocity .",
    "alternatively , we think that the average velocity of the lowest and highest velocities of the emission ( e.g. , edges of the line profile at @xmath30 and @xmath31 km s@xmath6 ) better represents the stellar velocity , i.e. , @xmath32 km s@xmath6 , because the sio @xmath2 emission is formed in the inner part of the circumstellar envelope which is considerably clumpy . however , note that this is the stellar velocity of the mira in the system , because the @xmath2 emission is attached to the inner circumstellar envelope of the mira .",
    "this velocity ( @xmath33 km s@xmath6 in the heliocentric radial velocity ) km s@xmath6 , which was given by @xcite using the average velocity of the ca i @xmath34 6573a absorption line during 1995 and 2001 . but",
    "this is rather fortuitous if we consider the @xmath35 yr orbital motion of the mira of @xmath36 km s@xmath6 in the binary model described in the next section .",
    "] is larger than most of the optically obtained radial velocities of atomic lines at the time of burst , which are in the range between @xmath37 and @xmath38 km s@xmath6 [ see supporting online material for @xcite ] . these optical lines ( a narrow central part of the profile )",
    "are formed in a part of mira wind faced on the white dwarf , where the gas is ionized by the uv radiation at radiation front of the shock .",
    "therefore , the radial velocity of the whole system is likely to be blueshifted relative to the mira .",
    "in addition to the present observations , spectra at 43 ghz sio and 22 ghz h@xmath19o masers taken three month before the outburst ( 2009 december ) became available recently @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the sio @xmath00 @xmath1 and 2 spectra exhibited the strongest peaks at @xmath39 km s@xmath6 at that time , but the h@xmath19o spectrum at @xmath40 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the sio @xmath00 @xmath2 profile showed the other weaker peaks at @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 km s@xmath6 .",
    "these observations before the burst together with our sio maser observations after the burst reasonably suggest that the nova outburst terminated the masers progressively from the lower ( @xmath44 km s@xmath6 ) to the higher velocities ( @xmath45 km s@xmath6 ) .",
    "however , a month later , a new lower velocity component was created .",
    "based on these observations , we construct a possible model to explain the variation of the sio maser profile in the next section .",
    "the basic physical parameters of the v407 cyg symbiotic system have been derived from the optical / ir photometric and spectroscopic observations in the past @xcite . from the pulsation period of about 745 d determined by @xmath46-band photometry",
    ", the distance from the sun has been estimated to be 2.7 kpc using the period - luminosity relation .",
    "the radius of the photosphere of the mira ( m6iii ; @xmath47 k ) is estimated to be @xmath48 cm .",
    "sio masers are formed at a few stellar radii of the photosphere , which has well been determined for similar stars in the past from vlbi observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) and sio maser pumping models ( e. g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite analyzed the b - band light curve during the past 75 years and derived a `` plausible '' orbital period as 43 ( @xmath49 ) yr , assuming that the time variation of the @xmath50-band magnitude is due to dust extinction of the light of the white - dwarf orbiting the mira .",
    "this period constrains a semi - major axis of the white - dwarf orbit into a narrow range as @xmath51  16.4 au ( @xmath52  @xmath53 cm ) , depending on the white - dwarf mass in a range between 0.5 and 1.4 @xmath54 and an assumed mass of 1 @xmath54 for the mira ( see table 5 of @xcite ) .",
    "the semi - major axis length does not vary much for the more plausible mass of 1.5  2 @xmath54 for the @xmath55 d mira ( e.g. , see equation ( 5 ) of @xcite ) , because it depends on the total mass of the binary system only in the power of @xmath56 .",
    "we adopt the length between the white dwarf and the mira of @xmath57 cm at the time of burst .",
    "this length locates the sio masing region ( located at a few stellar radii of the mira ) closest to the white dwarf to be at the halfway between the mira and white dwarf , i.e. , at the point separated both by about @xmath58 cm from the mira and from the white dwarf . in this case",
    ", the shock , which propagates with a velocity of 3000 km s@xmath6 ( suggested from the maximum line width of the h@xmath17 line ; @xcite ) , reaches in 4 days at the sio masing region facing toward the white dwarf .",
    "furthermore , the shock crosses the whole sio masing shell in a time scale of about 2 weeks after the burst .",
    "however , it is likely that the shock is gradually decelerated depending on the density of the ambient medium .",
    "molecular gases in the sio emitting region are also irradiated by uv and soft x - ray radiation .",
    "we first present a schematic view of the shock propagation revealed from the present sio maser observations , and then consider it more quantitatively in the following sections .      according to the standard theory of classic novae @xcite , nova outburst first starts from the surface of the white dwarf , and creates optically thick `` dynamical photosphere '' at a radius of about @xmath59 cm , when the optical light curve reaches the maximum .",
    "then the hot stellar wind develops behind the shock front , and the photosphere gradually shrinks in parallel with declining the optical light curve ( with @xmath60 ) . in the later phase ( @xmath61 d for v407 cyg ) , the light curve declines more rapidly ( with @xmath62 ) , when thermonuclear reactions cease on the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "it is natural that uv radiation from the shock dissociates the majority of molecules in the optically thin region around the mira , except molecules in the shadow of the red giant .",
    "taking into account the uv optical depth due to dust grain ( at 1000 a ; @xmath63/@xmath64 ) , where @xmath65 is the column density of hydrogen molecules ) , we infer that the uv radiation does not penetrate the sio masing gas with the h@xmath19 number density of about @xmath66 @xmath67 and the scale length of more than @xmath68 cm .",
    "therefore , we can safely assume that most sio molecules in the sio masing region survive from uv radiation of the nova , though the real situation may strongly depends on the amount of dust grains in the sio masing region and on the clumpiness of the outflowing gas .",
    "a major issue for making a model is how to interpret the split of the sio line emission into the red- and blue - shifted sides of the systemic velocity . in this paper",
    ", we consider that the origin of this velocity split of about 10 km s@xmath6 is due to the rotational motion of the mira envelope synchronized with the binary orbital motion ; the red- and blue - shift emissions come from the receding and approaching sides of the thick `` rotating disk '' , which is seen in edge - on view from observer ( upper panel of figure 3 ) . in this model , the position of the white dwarf must be located at the approaching side of the rotational disk to the observer ( see figure 3 ) , because the blue - shifted emission disappeared soon after the burst .",
    "upper panel of figure 3 illustrates the location of the shock front 12 days after the nova outburst . at this moment ,",
    "sio masing in the vicinity of the white dwarf is all terminated by the shock .",
    "the physical conditions required to maser pumping are broken due to the shock first at the near side to the white dwarf .",
    "therefore , at this moment , the sio maser emission was left only at the opposite side to the white dwarf , which is a receding part ( a red - shifted part ) of the rotating disk in this model ( indicated by the arrow ) .",
    "the shock terminated all the masing gas @xmath69 days later .",
    "( 60mm,70mm)fig3.eps    the present observation revealed that the blue - shifted components are quickly recovered after the burst .",
    "if we look the observed line profiles carefully , several weak peaks at @xmath70@xmath71 km s@xmath6 are recognizable in the line profile after march 22 . therefore , the replenishing seems to have started already on 12th days after the outburst , though once the blue - shifted emission in the observed spectrum almost disappeared on april 6 .",
    "if we assume that the velocity of the gas outflow from the mira is 20 km s@xmath6 , the gas passes through the length as small as @xmath72 cm in 30 days .",
    "it must be a thickness of the maser shell , and the real coherence length of the masing region ( on the line of sight ) must be several times this value .",
    "this model fits well to the current observational view of sio masers that the maser amplification occurs tangentially to the radial outflow @xcite .",
    "the reason of the quick recovery of the blue - shifted emission is that it is related to the mass outflow through the first lagrange point ( l@xmath73 ) of the binary .",
    "a number of sph numerical simulations were performed for the gas flows of symbiotic binaries ( for example , see @xcite ) . according to their calculations , the outflowing gas shapes in expanding spirals originating from l@xmath73 , at which the gravity balances with the centrifugal force .",
    "it is relatively easier for the radiation / dust driven outflow to escape from the gravity of the red giant through the first lagrange point due to its low potential barrier .",
    "it is most likely that the replenishing with the molecular gas in the circumstellar envelope starts from the region near l@xmath73 after the nova outburst .",
    "a schematic view presented in the present paper can offer a reasonable explanation of the profile variation of sio masers after the nova burst in v407 cyg .",
    "observations of the @xmath4-ray emission concurrent with the v407 cyg outburst offer another useful information on the interaction between nova shock and slow wind of the mira .",
    "the fermi collaboration @xcite explained that @xmath4-ray emission , which has been detected for about first two weeks after the nova outburst , was produced in the shock by two mechanisms : @xmath74 decay as a result of the @xmath75-@xmath75 interaction , or inverse compton scattering of the mira infrared radiation .",
    "both requires high energy ( @xmath76 gev ) particles which were accelerated by a sudden increase of magnetic field strength due to the interaction between the nova shell with a velocity of 3000 km s@xmath6 and ambient medium of the mira wind . here",
    "the ambient medium has a h@xmath19 number density of about @xmath77 @xmath67 at a distance of @xmath78 cm from the mira with a mass loss rate of @xmath79 y@xmath6 .",
    "the mass of the ejected material is deduced to be approximately @xmath80 ( for the o / ne nova with a white dwarf mass of 1.2 @xmath54 ; @xcite ) .",
    "a spherical shock with a velocity of 3000 km s@xmath6 will gradually be decelerated by sweeping the wind of the mira .",
    "the velocity decreases to a half if the shock sweeps approximately the same mass as the ejecta .",
    "the deceleration scale length at a point in the envelope can be approximated by @xmath81 for a spherically symmetric mira wind , where @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 are the velocity of the mira wind , the mass of nova ejecta , the mass loss rate of the mira , respectively , and @xmath85 and @xmath86 are distances from the center of the mira and from the center of the white dwarf , respectively .",
    "this equation gives the deceleration scale length to be @xmath58 cm for the hydrogen number density of the ambient medium of @xmath87 @xmath67 at @xmath88 cm ( for @xmath89 y@xmath6 , @xmath90 y@xmath6 , and @xmath91 km s@xmath6 ) .",
    "therefore , the shock can sustain its speed of 3000 km s@xmath6 at the halfway between the white dwarf and the mira .",
    "the deceleration length scale decreases rapidly to @xmath59 cm if it hits the gas of @xmath92 @xmath67 at @xmath93 cm and @xmath94 cm .",
    "in fact , observed variations of the h@xmath95 wing ( see figure 5 of @xcite ) indicate that the shock sustained the velocity above 2000 km s@xmath6 during the first 5 days , and it was decelerated to the velocity of about 1000 km s@xmath6 17 days after . therefore the shock front propagated in the distance of approximately @xmath96 cm ( on the line of sight ) in the first 3 weeks , which is roughly consistent with the estimation of the shock deceleration length scale present above .    in reality",
    ", the gas in the mira wind is more or less clumpy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the shock can blow out the sio masing clumps with @xmath97 @xmath67 with a diameter of @xmath59 cm at the half way between the mira and the white dwarf ( @xmath98 cm ) .",
    "furthermore , the gas density would decrease more rapidly toward the polar axis of the binary orbit than to equatorial directions , as calculated by @xcite . because shock deceleration is less severe toward the polar directions , the shock expands bipolarly .",
    "such a bipolar expansion of the nova shock has been observed by vlbi for the recurrent nova , rs oph @xcite , for which the energy of the event is comparable with that of the v407 cyg outburst @xcite .    strong x - ray emission from v407 cyg was also observed two weeks after the burst , and it continued more than a month @xcite .",
    "this emission is inferred to come from the shock which developed toward the polar axis initially , and wrapped over the inner dense envelope of the mira later . from the xrt photon counts of the swift x - ray telescope",
    "( see figure 1 of @xcite ) , we estimated the soft x - ray flux passing the unit area at @xmath99 cm to be @xmath100 photon @xmath64 s@xmath6 . because the optical depth of the soft x ray ( @xmath101 kev ) is about 1/20 of @xmath102(dust ) at 1000 a ( e.g. , see @xcite ) , it can penetrate into the sio masing gas .",
    "soft - x - ray photons ionize h@xmath19 molecules , producing mostly h@xmath103 , which are transformed in other form of molecular ions ( h@xmath104 and h@xmath105o@xmath106 ) , and quickly recombine with electrons .",
    "since soft - x - ray ionization of he is approximately 10 times efficient than the ionization of h@xmath19 @xcite , the most efficient source of electron is he in the molecular environment under soft - x ray irradiation .",
    "because the recombination of he@xmath106 with electron and the reaction of he@xmath106 with h@xmath19 are both slow , the most efficient route to return he@xmath106 to he is the reaction with h@xmath19o ( he@xmath106 + h@xmath19o @xmath107 oh@xmath106 + h + he ) with a reaction rate of @xmath108 s@xmath6 .",
    "therefore electron density in the gas can be estimated from the he ionization , and the ion - molecular reaction with h@xmath19o .",
    "we estimated that the above amount of soft x - ray irradiation can produce an electron density of @xmath109 @xmath67 in the sio masing clumpy shell with a @xmath110 cm thickness in a time scale of @xmath111 sec .",
    "it also heats the gas clump by a few hundred degree per day , but this does not induce severe dynamical change of sio masing gas of the hydrogen density of @xmath66 @xmath67 .",
    "however , the molecular excitation is significantly influenced by the increase of the electron density , which may terminate sio masers in an assumption that electron collision thermalizes the populations of maser levels .",
    "these estimations suggest that the nova shock wraps outside of the entire sio masing region ( of about @xmath112 cm ) in two weeks , and the soft x - ray penetrates into the sio masing clumps at the opposite side of the mira to the white dwarf and severely changes the molecular excitations there .",
    "it is likely that sio masers of v407 cyg at the higher velocity side ( i.e. , at the opposite side of the white dwarf ) were vanished in two weeks after the nova outburst by soft x - ray irradiation .",
    "the coincidence between the time of soft x - ray emergence and the time of sio maser disappearance , seems to support this idea .",
    "sio maser emission from the symbiotic star , v407 cyg , was monitored for 2.5 months after the nova outburst occurred on 2010 march 10 .",
    "the observations showed that the @xmath00 @xmath2 line gradually disappeared in two weeks , and a new component , which was shifted in velocity by about 5 km s@xmath6 from the disappeared component , emerged three weeks after the burst .",
    "the @xmath00 @xmath1 line was marginally detected during this period .",
    "these observations is reconcilable with the shock propagation model for classical novae .",
    "the shock stroked through the sio masing region and terminated masers .",
    "however , the masing gas was replenished quickly in three weeks after the nova outburst .",
    "the recovered area is inferred to appear near the first lagrange point , through which matters ejected from the mira can move with relatively low kinematic energy .",
    "the picture presented here is roughly consistent with the shock propagation model which was proposed for the @xmath4 ray emission concurrently observed with v407 outburst . since there still remain many free parameters for mass - outflowing binaries , high spatial - resolution observations such as very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) for the continuum and sio masers will be essential to constrain the models .",
    "hopefully the vlbi observations give us the detailed geometry of the system composing of the white dwarf , the agb star , and the mass outflow which is manifested by sio masers .",

    "<S> we report on the time variation of sio maser emission from the symbiotic stellar system v407 cyg after the classical nova outburst on 2010 march 10 . </S>",
    "<S> although both the sio @xmath00 @xmath1 and 2 lines at 43.122 and 42.821 ghz were found previously in the envelope of a mira in the binary system , only weak emission of the @xmath00 @xmath2 line has continuously been detectable after the nova outburst . </S>",
    "<S> the line profile exhibited a dramatic change several weeks after the burst ; the component on the higher - velocity side of the systemic velocity disappeared two weeks after the burst , and a new persistent component appeared on the lower - velocity side later . </S>",
    "<S> these observations indicate that the sio emitting regions are wiped out in a time scale of two weeks by the nova shock , but a part of the masing region is quickly replenished by cool molecular gases expelled by the mira pulsation . </S>"
