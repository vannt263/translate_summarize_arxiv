    "the afterglow emission of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) is generally described by the blast wave model @xcite which details the temporal and spectral behaviour of the emission that is created by external shocks when a collimated ultra - relativistic jet ploughs into the circumburst medium , driving a blast wave ahead of it .",
    "fundamental to this model is the electron energy distribution index , @xmath0 ; a characteristic parameter of the process by which the electrons are accelerated to relativistic speeds and by which they radiate via synchrotron emission .",
    "this acceleration mechanism , common to many astronomical jet sources ( as well as particle acceleration in the solar wind and supernovae , and the acceleration of cosmic rays ) , is thought to be fermi diffusive shock acceleration @xcite due to the passage of an external shock after which the energy of the electrons , @xmath4 , follows a power - law distribution , @xmath5 , with a cut - off at low energies .",
    "this is consistent with recent pic simulations @xcite and monte carlo models @xcite but at odds with others @xcite .",
    "the blast wave model describes how synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons produces a smoothly - broken , broad band spectrum that is well characterised by a peak flux and three , time evolving , break frequencies ( peak frequency , @xmath6 ; cooling frequency , @xmath7 ; synchrotron self - absorption frequency , @xmath8 ) as well as the electron energy distribution index , @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the spectrum is divided into four regimes by the three break frequencies and within each regime the spectrum is asymptotically described by @xmath9 , where the spectral index , @xmath10 , is a function of @xmath0 only . by comparing the observed x - ray spectra to the predicted asymptotic values of the synchrotron spectra , we can extract information about the electron energy distribution index , @xmath0 , which is dependent only on the underlying micro - physics of the acceleration process .",
    "some ( semi-)analytical calculations and simulations indicate that there is a nearly universal value of @xmath11 ( e.g. , @xcite ) though other studies suggest that there is a large range of possible values for @xmath0 of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "observationally , different methods have been applied to samples of batse , _ bepposax _ and _ swift _ bursts which reached the conclusion that the observed range of @xmath0 values is not consistent with a single central value of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the latter three showed that the width of the parent distribution is @xmath13 .",
    "however , in the studies so far there have been some limitations : multi - wavelength studies @xcite suffer from limited samples ( @xmath14 sources each ) with sufficient temporal and spectral observations , while those studies that rely on x - ray afterglows alone are subject to a large uncertainty because the position of the cooling frequency , relative to the x - ray , is unknown . the only x - ray study of _ swift _ afterglows so far @xcite used a very limited sample of spectral indices ( @xmath15 ) , dictated by the number of grbs observed by _ swift _ at the time , to estimate the distribution of @xmath0 .",
    "neither , they did not take a statistical approach to the position of the cooling frequency relative to the x - ray regime , as we do here .",
    "we interpret a much larger ( @xmath16 ) and , statistically , more significant sample of _ swift _ observed grb afterglows , to constrain the _ distribution _ of the values of electron energy distribution index , @xmath0 . in ",
    "[ section : method ] we introduce our method while in  [ section : results ] we present the results of our monte carlo analyses and their implications in the overall context of grb observations and particle acceleration in general .",
    "we summarise our findings in  [ section : conclusion ] .",
    "all uncertainties are quoted at the @xmath17 confidence level .",
    "our general method is to constrain the electron energy distribution index , @xmath0 , from the values of the x - ray spectral indices , @xmath18 or @xmath10 , observed by the _ swift _",

    "* table7 ) .",
    "a normalised histogram of the spectral indices of these 301 grb spectra is plotted in figure [ fig : hist ] .",
    "we derive @xmath0 from the spectral index as opposed to the temporal index because for a given spectral index , assuming the asymptotic limit , there are only two possible values of @xmath0 depending on whether the cooling frequency , @xmath19 is less than or greater than the x - ray regime , @xmath20 , while for a given temporal index there are multiple possible values which are model dependent ( e.g. , the simple blast wave model @xcite , or modifications thereof ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; for a discussion on the choice of x - ray spectral index to derive @xmath0 see @xcite ) . in accordance with synchrotron emission predicted by the blast wave model",
    ", we ascribe the behaviour of the unabsorbed x - ray spectrum to be a single power law where the flux goes as : @xmath21 and @xmath10 is the spectral index . under the standard assumptions of slow cooling and adiabatic expansion of the blast wave , the electron energy distribution index is related , in the asymptotic limit , to the spectral index by either @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) or @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; implying a difference between the slopes of the two spectral regimes of @xmath26 .",
    "throughout we use the regime probability , @xmath27 , as the probability that the cooling frequency is less than the frequency of the x - ray regime ( i.e. , @xmath23 ) and @xmath28 is the probability that @xmath25 .",
    "we neglect the case where the cooling frequency may be passing through the x - ray regime ( since there is no sign of spectral evolution in the sample ) and the cases where the peak frequency , @xmath6 , or self absorption frequency , @xmath8 , is greater than the x - ray regime as this is not observed in late time afterglows .    to parameterise the underlying distribution of the electron energy distribution index , @xmath0 , from the x - ray spectral indices observed by _",
    "swift _ we use a maximum likelihood monte carlo method .",
    "this method uses a maximum likelihood fit to return the _ most likely _ parameters of the assumed underlying model , the errors on which are estimated via a monte carlo error analysis .",
    "another monte carlo analysis tests the probability that the observed distribution of spectral indices could be obtained from an underlying distribution of @xmath0 described by the most likely parameters .    in this method",
    "we first assume a model for the underlying distribution of @xmath0 which we transform into a distribution in spectral index space , via the regime probability , @xmath27 .",
    "we convolve this distribution with the measured probability of the data set and calculate the log - likelihood of the parameters of the underlying model ( see appendix[section : prob.functions ] ) . to estimate the most likely parameters of the underlying model and the regime probability , @xmath27 , we minimise the log - likelihood ( equates to maximising the likelihood ) using the _ simulated annealing _ method ( @xmath29 10.9 of @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "uncertainties of the fit parameters are estimated via a monte carlo analysis , whereby the observed data are randomly perturbed within their ( asymmetric ) gaussian errors and refit multiple times ( @xmath30 ) ; the standard deviation of returned most likely parameters is used as a measure of the uncertainties .",
    "we then find the probability that the observed distribution of spectral indices could have originated from an underlying distribution of @xmath0 based on the most likely parameters estimated from the log - likelihood minimisation .",
    "we do so by generating @xmath30 synthetic data sets drawn randomly from the underlying probability distribution of @xmath0 , randomly transformed into spectral index space via the regime probability , @xmath27 , and further randomly perturbed within the ( asymmetric ) gaussian errors of each of our original data points .",
    "each of these synthetic data sets is fit as above and the value of the log - likelihoods recorded ; one would expect that if the data are consistent with the underlying model , at the @xmath17 level , the original log - likelihood value should fall within the @xmath17 distribution of the synthetic values . with @xmath30 synthetic data sets we can measure the percentage to an accuracy of two decimal places and rule out chance agreements to the @xmath31 level ;",
    "the @xmath32 synthetic data sets required to rule out chance agreements at the @xmath33 level was considered too costly , computationally .",
    "there are two underlying models , or hypotheses , regarding the data that we want to test : that the observed distribution of spectral indices , @xmath10 , can be obtained from an underlying distribution of @xmath0 composed of @xmath34 a single discrete value ( sd@xmath0 ) and @xmath35 a gaussian distribution ( gd@xmath0 ) .",

    "though our most likely discrete value of @xmath39 agrees well with the predicted universal value of @xmath40 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , it is comprehensively rejected by our tests ; the hypothesis that the observed distribution of spectral indices , @xmath10 , can be obtained from an underlying distribution of @xmath0 composed of a single discrete value ( sd@xmath0 ) is rejected at the @xmath41 level as all synthesized data sets had better log - likelihoods .",
    "the hypothesis that the observed distribution can be obtained from an underlying gaussian distribution ( gd@xmath0 ) centred at @xmath1 , having a width of @xmath42 and regime probability , @xmath43 , is acceptable at the @xmath44 level ( figure[fig : l - dist ] ) . as a visual aid",
    ", we compare the normalised histogram of the observed data with the high - resolution normalised , average histograms of the @xmath45 synthesized data sets ( figure[fig : hist ] ) .",
    "note that the sd@xmath0 model is clearly a poor fit and exhibits a secondary peak at @xmath46 due to the fact that @xmath47 for the likelihood fit of that model to the observed spectral indices .",
    "this result confirms the results from previous small - sample grb afterglow studies @xcite as regards the non - universality of @xmath0 , the central value at @xmath48 , and the width of the distribution of @xmath49 .",
    "however , our results are based on a sample of bursts an order of magnitude larger than these studies and we took a statistical approach to the position of cooling frequency relative to the x - ray , by using the regime probability , @xmath27 .",
    "given that the value of @xmath0 is not universal , it may be possible that it changes suddenly or evolves gradually with time or radius even in a single event as environmental shock parameters ( e.g. , magnetic field , ambient density ) change or evolve ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is also possible that different components of a structured jet @xcite , multi - component jet @xcite or jet - cocoon @xcite could have different values of @xmath0 .",
    "if either are the case our derived values of @xmath0 should be considered time averaged values of the parameter , though a change or evolution of @xmath0 should be observable as a change or evolution of the synchrotron spectral index , @xmath10 , and no significant example of such an evolution has been observed in grb afterglows .",
    "though previous multi - band ( optical  x - ray ) studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) have shown that the cooling break frequencies of a number of grb afterglows are greater than the x - ray frequency ( @xmath25 ) , here , accepting that the underlying distribution of @xmath0 is a gaussian , we find that this number is consistent with zero ( @xmath50 ) . from our monte carlo error analysis (",
    "where we refit the randomly perturbed data multiple times ) we can plot the distribution of possible values of @xmath27 ( figure[fig : x_limits ] ; note that this is a log - log plot ) .",
    "the distribution of the errors is clearly not gaussian so we should not use the standard deviation as a measure of error as we have in table[table : results ] .",
    "we can however place a nominal @xmath51 lower limit on the value of @xmath27 by estimating the value at which there is 99.7 percent containment ; we find that this is at @xmath52 , compared to the nominal @xmath17 ( 68.2 percent containment ) at @xmath53 .",
    "any value of x less than this limit is inconsistent with the distribution of the data and would produce a clear secondary peak at @xmath54 , not observed in the data ( figure[fig : hist ] ) . to avoid this peak ,",
    "an extremely wide distribution is needed , much wider than the spread of the observed data .",
    "hence , the upper limit on the percentage of grbs in our sample where the cooling frequency is greater than the x - ray frequency ( @xmath25 ) is approximately 6.5 percent , or @xmath55 out of 301 grbs .",
    "this is a discrepancy from the ratio observed in the multi - band studies ( e.g. , @xcite : 5 out of 10 and 2 out of 6 , respectively ) but not seriously so given the extremely low number statistics of those studies .",
    "if we create a sample of 6 random bursts from our statistical distribution of 301 , there would be a non - negligible ( @xmath56 5 percent ) chance that 2 , or more , bursts would have a cooling frequency greater than the x - ray frequency , consistent with the aforementioned _ swift _ study ( @xcite ) .",
    "the study of @xcite is based on a sample of _ bepposax _ , as opposed to _ swift _ ,",
    "grbs which may have a different limit on the regime probability , @xmath27 .",
    "an investigation as to why the cooling frequency of afterglows follow this apparent limit , or its implications regarding the distribution of other parameters , is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we use the x - ray spectral indices of gamma - ray burst afterglows observed by the xrt aboard _ swift _ to parameterise the underlying distribution of the electron energy distribution index , @xmath0 , within the framework of the blast wave model .",
    "the electron energy distribution index is a fundamental parameter of the synchrotron emission from a range of astronomical sources and in this case of the synchrotron emission of grb afterglows .",
    "we use a maximum likelihood monte carlo analysis to test two hypotheses , namely that the observed distribution of spectral indices , @xmath10 , can be obtained from an underlying distribution of @xmath0 composed of @xmath34 a single discrete value and @xmath35 a gaussian distribution .",
    "we find that the observed distribution of spectral indices are inconsistent with the first hypothesis but consistent with the second , a gaussian distribution centred at @xmath1 and having a width of @xmath2 .",
