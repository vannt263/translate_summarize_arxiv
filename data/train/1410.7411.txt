    "@xcite , we can extract data of the emergent topological quantum field theory for a given hamiltonian .",
    "the study of such systems is not only of significant fundamental interest , but topological systems also offer a promising route towards quantum information processing in an intrinsically fault - tolerant manner  @xcite .",
    "while two - dimensional topological phases are well understood , their three - dimensional  @xcite , and higher - dimensional  @xcite counterparts remain a largely unexplored area of research  @xcite . of recent interest",
    "are the boundaries of three - dimensional phases .",
    "specifically , it has been shown that two - dimensional chiral topological phases , e.g. , the semion model , exist on the boundaries of certain three - dimensional phases  @xcite .",
    "conversely , in some topological phases , we have boundaries that condense particle - like or line - like excitations , which are well studied in two dimensions  @xcite . here",
    "we develop tools to probe the boundaries of three - dimensional topologically ordered phases using on entropic quantities .",
    "the topological entanglement entropy , @xmath0 , is the constant correction term of the entanglement entropy formula for the ground state of a system @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the von neumann entropy of subsystem @xmath3 , constant @xmath4 depends on the microscopic details of the system , @xmath5 is the length of the boundary that separates subsystem @xmath3 from its complement and @xmath6 is the number of disconnected components of the boundary  @xcite . assuming that the low - energy physics is described by a topological quantum field theory , @xmath0 reveals information about the underlying field theory  @xcite , as well as the data of individual anyonic quasiparticles  @xcite , and their braiding statistics  @xcite .    in this manuscript",
    ", we prove a no - go theorem that illuminates the excitation structure of a system without using any prior assumptions about an underlying topological quantum field theory .",
    "instead , we make assumptions only about the support of creation operators of its quasiparticle excitations . our results extend existing theorems that give conditions for which topological ground - state degeneracy can or can not be present  @xcite .",
    "novel to this work is that our theorem constrains low - energy excitations , not the ground state degeneracy .",
    "more precisely , we prove that the low - energy excitations of a local gapped hamiltonian are topologically trivial in the case that constant term @xmath0 vanishes .",
    "we show this by proving the following expression @xmath7 for ground state @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the norm of the vector .",
    "unitary operator @xmath10 creates excitations from the vacuum , and @xmath11 represents a unitary process of ( i ) creating particles , ( ii ) performing some non - trivial monodromy operation with a quasiparticle created with @xmath10 , and ( iii ) annihilating the particles created by @xmath11 .",
    "the result of eq.[eq : main_result ] may seem unsurprising in view of rigorously studied two - dimensional(2d ) topological phases  @xcite .",
    "however , the novelty of our method is that we obtain this result without making any assumptions that depend on the microscopic details of the hamiltonian .",
    "we only assume that we can perform a monodromy operation between particles using operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this generality enables us to perform a similar analysis in more complicated settings which in turn allow us to find new topological invariants .",
    "another point worth noting is that our method can be easily extended to higher dimensional systems .",
    "indeed , we explicitly demonstrate the power of our framework by proving that certain linear combinations of entanglement entropies can not vanish on the boundary of certain three - dimensional(3d ) topologically ordered systems that support topological excitations .",
    "specifically , we find a pair of topological invariants that are defined on the boundary , each of which represent the long - range entanglement associated to the point - like and line - like excitations .",
    "if the invariant for the point - like excitations is zero , all point - like excitations can be condensed at the boundary .",
    "similarly , if the invariant for the line - like excitations is zero , all such excitations can be condensed at the boundary .",
    "we give evidence that these numbers are universal by explicit analytical calculation using the boundaries of the 3d toric code  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we expect these diagonistics to be useful for analyzing walker - wang models  @xcite , as we are able to prove that the invariants must attain a nonzero value for these models .",
    "this is surprising since previous analyses have shown that bulk topological entanglement entropy give null results for the modular variants of the walker - wang models  @xcite .",
    "further , our results extend the work of grover  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , where they seek entropic topological invariants in higher - dimensional phases . in their work",
    "they show that there is only one invariant in the _ bulk _ of three - dimensional topologically ordered systems .",
    "our results show that the entanglement structure at the boundary of a topological phase can potentially be richer than that of the bulk , as we find two distinct diagnostics that provide information about different types of low - energy excitations at the boundary of a model .",
    "the remainder of this manuscript is structured as follows ; in sec .",

    "let us first sketch the proof that @xmath0 must be non vanishing for a two - dimensional model to give rise to anyonic excitations .",
    "we begin by considering the creation of two quasiparticles by a string - like operator @xmath10 .",
    "then we identify a condition on @xmath10 that ought to be satisfied for any anyon model .",
    "this condition , which shall be explained shortly , implies that the action of @xmath10 on the ground state can be approximated by a unitary operator @xmath12 which lies only in the vicinity of the quasiparticles , with an approximation error that scales as @xmath13 .",
    "we show this using the fact that @xmath11 has no common support with @xmath12 and thus commutes with @xmath11 .",
    "the inequality of eq.[eq : main_result ] follows from this observation .",
    "these arguments make use of the well - known concepts in quantum information theory , and as such , we set the relevant terminology and definitions first .",
    "we use two different distance measures between quantum states @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the fidelity , @xmath16 , and the trace distance , @xmath17 .",
    "these two measures can be used interchangeably , due to their well - known relation  @xcite : @xmath18    now we go through the details of each steps .",
    "let us begin by stating the most crucial part of the argument , which is pictorially represented in fig.[fig : secondstep ] . to be more specific ,",
    "consider a pair of quasiparticles created out of the vacuum state @xmath8 by a string - like unitary operator @xmath10 .",
    "we show that @xmath19 for some @xmath12 that lies in the vicinity of the particles , if @xmath10 is _ freely deformable _ ; we say that @xmath10 is freely deformable if the particles can be created by another string - like unitary operator @xmath20 whose support can be continuously deformed into that of @xmath10 .",
    "this is a natural assumption that is expected to hold for many anyon models .",
    "when @xmath21 , the above assertion implies that @xmath22 . in short , the effective support of @xmath10 is reduced",
    "we refer to such process as the _ cleaning process _  .",
    "the cleaning process relies upon two facts about general quantum states .",
    "we first lay out these observations and later explain how they can be applied to anyon models .",
    "first , for any two bipartite pure states @xmath23 and @xmath24 that have identical density matrices over a subsystem can be mapped onto one another by applying a unitary operation only on the complementary subsystem .",
    "second , there is a condition under which one can check the equivalence of two states from their local subsystems  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use the second observation to argue that @xmath25 and @xmath8 have the same density matrices over the complement of the support of @xmath12 if @xmath0 is small .",
    "then we use the first observation to argue that there exists a unitary @xmath12 which is supported on a smaller region , as explained in fig .",
    "[ fig : secondstep ] .",
    "we now elaborate on these observations .",
    "the first observation follows from the celebrated uhlmann s theorem  @xcite , which asserts that @xmath26 is equal to the maximum overlap over their purifications : @xmath27 in our context , we envision @xmath14 and @xmath15 to be the reduced states that are inherited from some bipartite pure states @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "if the fidelity between @xmath14 and @xmath15 is @xmath30 , the above relation implies that there exists a purification of @xmath15 that has a unit overlap with @xmath28 .",
    "in particular , it would imply the existence of a unitary operator acting on the complement of the support of @xmath14 , such that it maps @xmath28 to @xmath29 and vice versa .",
    ".[fig : consistent_regions ] ]    the second observation lies on a recently discovered fact : that two locally equivalent many - body quantum states are globally equivalent under a certain condition .",
    "if @xmath31 and @xmath32 are consistent over @xmath33 and @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the following inequality holds : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the conditional mutual information for density matrix @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "so far we have discussed two general facts about quantum states .",
    "the natural course is to explain what these facts imply for anyon models . without loss of generality ,",
    "let us choose @xmath14 to be the ground state , i.e. , @xmath39 and @xmath15 to be the excited state , i.e. , @xmath40 .",
    "we divide the systems into the regions shown in fig.[fig : consistent_regions ] , for reasons that will soon become apparent .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath14 and @xmath15 must have the same density matrices over @xmath33 and @xmath34 since @xmath10 can be deformed to have a support complementary to these regions .",
    "importantly , this implies that we can use eq.[eq : le_ge ] .",
    "we estimate the right - hand side of eq.[eq : le_ge ] for the choices we have just made .",
    "quantum entropy obeys strong subadditivity of entropy  @xcite , which implies that @xmath41 .",
    "recall that entanglement entropy over a region is equal to the entanglement entropy over its complement , if the global state is pure .",
    "therefore , the right - hand - side of eq.[eq : le_ge ] can be bounded by the sum of @xmath42 and @xmath43 . since @xmath10 can be freely deformed to be supported on the complement of @xmath44 , we have that @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we therefore obtain the bound @xmath48.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    having obtained an upper bound for @xmath49 that depends only on the ground state @xmath14 , it can be evaluated for topologically ordered states using eq.[eq : tee ] .",
    "we arrive at the conclusion that @xmath31 can be approximated by @xmath32 with an approximation error of @xmath50 , i.e. , @xmath51 if @xmath21 , @xmath52 . by uhlmann s theorem",
    ", this would imply that @xmath25 can be mapped into @xmath8 by applying a unitary operator on the complement of @xmath53 , thus proving eq.[eq : main_result_intermediate ] .",
    "intuitively , this leads to a contradiction if the particle carries a nontrivial topological charge .",
    "this is due to the defining characteristics of such particles : that they can not be created or annihilated locally .",
    "we use two simple facts to show this concretely .",
    "first , @xmath54 .",
    "this means that the process @xmath11 acts trivially on the ground state .",
    "second , @xmath11 commutes with @xmath12 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the support of @xmath12 lies only in the vicinity of the quasiparticles , whereas the support of @xmath11 can be made to be far away from the quasiparticles .",
    "since the norm is invariant under unitary rotation , @xmath55 it should be noted that @xmath56 is actually equal to @xmath57 due to the commutation relation . since @xmath11 acts trivially on the ground state , @xmath58 applying the triangle inequality to the above two inequalities ,",
    "we arrive at eq.[eq : main_result ] .",
    "so far we have explained why @xmath0 must attain a nonzero value if anyons exist in two - dimensional systems ; otherwise any excitation can be created locally from the vacuum .",
    "this is an instructive example which demonstrates the fundamental connection between the ground - state entanglement and the properties of the low - energy excitations .",
    "this intuition can be extended to systems of higher dimension to probe the nature of different types of quasiparticle excitations .",
    "further , we can develop our intuition to study the boundaries of topological phases , where the physics of a system will change .",
    "near the boundary , certain topologically nontrivial excitations can be created locally out of the vacuum .",
    "this is because certain boundaries are capable of absorbing , or ` condensing ' certain topological excitations  @xcite . as such",
    ", the aforementioned argument can be modified accordingly to identify boundaries that condense topological charges .",
    "conversely , it follows from our argument that phases that support topological excitations on their boundaries necessarily have nonzero topological entanglement entropy .    .",
    "the green surface in ( a ) is the physical boundary .",
    "( b ) and ( c ) show regions @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "the red dots in ( d ) represent the point - like excitations we wish to examine .",
    "[ fig : obstructions_3d_point ] ]    remarkably , in 3d , topological phases can host exotic line - like quasiparticle excitations that carry nontrivial topological charge , as well as point - like excitations . to this end",
    "we can construct topological invariants to identify both point - like and line - like topological excitations by consideration of the support of their creation operators .",
    "we give two topological invariants that are applicable to the boundaries of three - dimensional topological phases .",
    "the first , the _ point topological entanglement entropy _ ,",
    "is designed to learn the nature of point - like particles near a boundary .",
    "the second , the _ line topological entanglement entropy _ , achieves a null value for boundaries where all line - like excitations are topologically trivial .",
    "our invariants are obtained following an argument similar to that given in the previous section .",
    "we define the point topological entanglement entropy , @xmath61 , as @xmath62 where regions @xmath60 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 are shown in fig.[fig : obstructions_3d_point ] .",
    "region @xmath3 is the complementary subsystem of region @xmath44 .",
    "the regions in fig.[fig : obstructions_3d_point ] are labeled such that they perform analogous roles to the regions with the same labels in fig.[fig : consistent_regions ] in the 2d argument given in the previous section . for brevity",
    ", we have not shown the regions @xmath65 and @xmath66 we have used in the previous section .",
    "these regions are implicitly included in region @xmath3 adjacent to the parts of region @xmath64 where the quasiparticles are created .",
    "drawing this analogy allows us to generalize the 2d argument in a natural way to study point excitations on the boundaries of 3d systems . at a high level",
    ", one can imagine creating a pair of quasiparticles by applying a deformable string - like operator @xmath10 that is supported on subsystem @xmath59 that , importantly , includes part of the boundary .",
    "if @xmath67 is small , the action of @xmath10 on the ground state can be approximated by @xmath12 which lies in the vicinity of the quasiparticles .",
    "such @xmath12 exists only if the quasiparticles can be created locally near to a boundary .",
    "conversely , if there are any point - like excitations that can not be created by such @xmath12 , @xmath67 can not vanish .",
    "as we did in the 2d case , let us compare two states , the vacuum state , @xmath14 , and an excited state with two point - like excitations , @xmath15 ; see fig.[fig : obstructions_3d_point](d ) . by our assumption that @xmath10 is freely deformable , both states have identical density matrices over @xmath34 and @xmath59 .",
    "with @xmath3 the complement of the regions depicted in fig.[fig : obstructions_3d_point](a ) , the trace distance @xmath68 is upper bounded by @xmath69 .",
    "if @xmath61 is @xmath70 , eq.[eq : le_ge ] implies that @xmath14 and @xmath15 are identical over @xmath53 . by invoking uhlmann s theorem ,",
    "we conclude that there must exist a unitary operator in the complement of @xmath53 that maps @xmath14 to @xmath15 . since this region is in the vicinity of the particles ,",
    "we conclude that the particles can be annihilated or created locally .",

    "the red line in ( d ) represents the line - like excitation we wish to identify.[fig : obstructions_3d_line ] ]    a similar argument can be carried out for the line - like excitations .",
    "we define the _ line topological entanglement entropy _ , @xmath71 , by the equation @xmath72 where regions @xmath60 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 are shown in fig.[fig : obstructions_3d_line ] .",
    "again , subsystem @xmath3 is the complement of subsystem @xmath44 .",
    "once again our previous argument holds ; we imagine creating a line - like excitation by applying a unitary operator @xmath10 that has nontrivial support on subsystem @xmath59 , as is shown in fig.[fig : obstructions_3d_line](d ) .",

    "such @xmath12 exists only if either the system has no topologically nontrivial line particles , or if the boundary can absorb all the line - like excitations of the system . as before , it is also true that if there are any line - like excitations that can not be created by some @xmath12 , the quantity @xmath73 can not vanish .    for completeness",
    "we explicitly make the argument explaining why the line topological entanglement entropy is a topological invariant .",
    "we compare two states , the vacuum state , @xmath14 , and an excited state with a loop - like excitation , @xmath15 . by our assumption that @xmath10 is freely deformable ,",

    "if @xmath71 is @xmath70 , eq.[eq : le_ge ] implies that @xmath14 and @xmath15 are identical over @xmath53 .",
    "uhlmann s theorem then implies that there must exist a unitary operator in the complement of @xmath53 that maps these two states . since this region is a solid torus that surrounds the loop - like excitation , vanishing line topological entanglement entropy implies that the loop - like excitation can be condensed at the boundary .      in the 2d case ,",
    "the linear combination was concocted in such a way that the area terms in eq.[eq : tee ] cancel each other out .",
    "based on a general physical intuition that the leading term is due to the short - range entanglement across the cut , we expect a similar behavior for the regions in fig.[fig : obstructions_3d_point ] and fig.[fig : obstructions_3d_line ] .",
    "it should be noted that the physical boundary does not contribute to such short - range entanglement , since the vacuum that lies beyond the physical boundary is not entangled with the medium .",
    "assuming such a behavior indeed holds , one can easily see that the contributions from the short - range entanglement are canceled out .",
    "the remaining term is invariant under smooth deformation of the regions .",
    "therefore , we expect it to be a topological invariant that characterizes the phase .",
    "in particular , we have shown that the point(line ) topological entanglement entropy becomes @xmath70 only if all the point - like(line - like ) excitations can be condensed at the given boundary . moreover ,",

    "in contrast , our argument proves that the point topological entanglement entropy must be nontrivial for modular walker - wang models  @xcite .",
    "we point out that while our diagnostics give to positive values for boundaries where topological excitations are realized , we have not shown that a nonzero value guarantees a system with topological excitations at the boundary .",
    "it seems unlikely that one could give such a proof as examples of topologically trivial systems that show nontrivial topological behaviour with respect to certain entropic invariants are known  @xcite . to this end",

    "as predicted , this result is indicative of the existence of topological point particles that can not be absorbed at the boundary .",

    "we write the generators @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is supported on subsystem @xmath3 and @xmath102 is supported on subsystem @xmath60 .",

    "the restricted stabilizer generators , @xmath101 , do not in general commute .",
    "the method of fattal  _ et al .",
    "_ looks to find a generating set where each restricted generator either commute with all other restricted generators , or anti commute with only one other restricted generator .",
    "specifically , we look for @xmath103 elements of the restricted generating set that satisfies @xmath104 for all @xmath105 . the state described by @xmath106 shares @xmath107 ebits of entanglement between subsystem @xmath3 and @xmath60 .",
    "generating sets where we are able to count _ pairs _ of anti - commuting operators when restricted to a subsystem are said to be in _",
    "canonical form_. the result of fattal _ et al . _",
    "shows that it is always possible to find a generating set in canonical form for any bipartition of the stabilizer group .",
    "we must find a generating set of the stabilizer group of the 3d toric code that is in canonical form under a given bipartition .",
    "this enables us to count the ebits shared between two subsystems .",
    "importantly , the generating set is over complete if we include @xmath108 operators for all the faces .",
    "this is seen by taking the product of all the plaquette operators corresponding to the faces that bound a cube .",
    "this product returns identity , showing an over - complete generating set where eigenvalues of stabilizers are dependent on others .",
    "we choose an independent generating set that includes all plaquette operators that lie parallel to the @xmath109 and @xmath110 plane , and we only take the plaquette operators parallel to the @xmath111 plane in a single plane at some fixed @xmath112 .",
    "we are free to choose which plane , and for simplicity we always take this plane to be far away from the region of interest for the entropy calculation .",
    "for this reason , for all the calculations we make , it is sufficient to consider the only the plaquette generators parallel to the @xmath109 and @xmath110 plane .",
    "similarly , we point out now that we need not account for the logical operators that may appear in the generating set of the stabilizer group .",
    "logical operators can always be deformed away from the regions of interest on the lattice and as such never contribute to the entanglement in any of the bipartitions we study . moreover , our results are independent on the choice of ground state .",

    "we show the graph that corresponds to the corner of the region to the right of fig.[jelly ] . in this graph , vertices represent the restriction of star operators on region @xmath3 , and each edge represents the restriction of an independent plaquette operator .",
    "an edge that is incident to a vertex represents a restricted plaquette operator that anti commutes with the respective restricted star operator that is represented by the adjacent vertex .",
    "the graph is not in canonical form as there are many edges incident to each vertex .",
    "we show the full graph for the restriction of a ball - shaped region in fig.[cuboid ] , where any double edges connecting two vertices are removed .",
    "we will see why we are free to replace double edges with single edges shortly .",
    "we face the task of finding edges that we are allowed to remove from the graph to find a canonical generating set while still generating @xmath106 .",
    "we complete the entropy calculation by introducing rules that enable us to find canonical form and count the ebits of entanglement shared between the region and its complement .    for a ball - shaped region in the bulk of the lattice , @xmath78 , we recover the known result @xmath117 where @xmath80 is the number of star operators with nontrivial support on both subsystem @xmath3 and subsystem @xmath60 .",

    "we replace it with the product of the generators represented by @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "this effectively removes @xmath125 , as the new restricted generator commutes with all the star operators shown on the graph .    similarly , as shown in fig.[rules](middle )",
    ", we can remove a single edge from four edges , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 , bounding a square face .",
    "we replace the plaquette operator represented by @xmath127 with the product of all the stabilizer generators corresponding to the edges bounding the square such that the new restricted generator commutes with all the vertices of the graph .",
    "we thus effectively remove the edge from the graph .",
    "this rule trivially generalizes to any circuit .",
    "we show this generalization in fig.[rules](right ) .",
    "we apply the circuit rule to the different faces of the graph shown in fig.[cuboid ] . using this rule",

    "we have that @xmath138 for @xmath139 .",
    "we find a canonical form for the edges and vertices of the loose end by making the replacement @xmath140 for all odd @xmath134 , and @xmath141 for even @xmath134 .",
    "with this replacement we have @xmath142 for @xmath120 . we thus identify @xmath118 ebits of entanglement for a loose end of length @xmath118 .",
    "we now identify the entanglement of a face of a cuboid , as shown in fig.[faceent ] .",
    "we use the loose - end rule to see that all the vertices in each face of the graph contribute a single unit of entanglement to the calculation , and thus that all the vertices contribute to the area term of the entropy .",
    "we extend this to all the faces of the cube , as shown in fig.[cubeentandframe ] .",
    "we remove @xmath143 vertices from the graph on the left hand side of the equation using the circuit rule and the loose - end rule .",
    "each vertex removed contributes a single unit of entanglement in the calculation , we thus identify @xmath143 ebits of entanglement on the right hand side of the equality . ]",
    "we can continue to use the circuit rule and the loose - end rule to arrive at the result of fig.[oneloopleft ] where only a single loop of edges remains in the graph .",
    "importantly , all the vertices that have been removed from the graph have contributed one unit to the entanglement entropy . to complete the calculation we must assess the entanglement of the single loop of edges that remains in the graph .",
    "a loop of length @xmath118 is a circuit of @xmath118 edges , @xmath119 , such that the only edges of the graph incident to vertices @xmath129 are @xmath144 and @xmath131 for all @xmath134 where edge @xmath145 .",
    "we show the loop rule graphically in fig.[closedlooprule ] .",

    "initially , we have that every @xmath147 anti commutes with two other restricted generators , @xmath148 and @xmath149 , where @xmath150 to accommodate the periodic structure of the loop .    to obtain canonical form , we must replace a single star operator with the product of all the star operators in the loop @xmath151 , such that @xmath152 commutes with all the @xmath153 denoted by edges in the loop .",
    "similarly , we make the substitution @xmath154 , such that @xmath155 commutes with all the other restricted operators in the loop .",
    "having removed one edge and one vertex from the loop , we can reduce the remaining @xmath133 with @xmath156 into canonical form using the loose - end rule .",
    "we thus identify @xmath146 ebits of entanglement .",
    "one can check that this method extends to any region with a connected boundary , such as an annulus .",
    "ultimately , the calculation will always reduce the graph to a loop .",
    "we are then able to remove a single vertex without contributing to the entanglement , thus always giving the desired result for a connected boundary . in general , for regions that include multiple disjoint boundaries , every connected boundary can be reduced to a single loop , enabling us to remove one vertex of the graph per connected boundary without contributing to the entanglement .",
    "the topological correction will therefore scale with the number of connected boundaries that enclose the region .",
    "the graph on the left side of the equality shows an extended circuit of black edges . both ends of the series terminates at an edge , not a vertex .",
    "the right hand side of the equality shows a single edge removed from the extended circuit , as is permitted by the extended circuit rule . ]",
    "we repeatedly apply the extended circuit rule to detach loose ends from graph .",
    "each of the vertices of these loose ends contribute a single unit of entanglement to the calculation by the loose - end rule . ]",
    "the entanglement entropy of a ball - shaped region that includes qubits from a smooth boundary gives the same topological contribution as the case we previously considered in the bulk .",
    "we show the graph of restricted generators of such a region in fig.[smoothsurfaceball ] .",
    "the result @xmath157 is obtained using the rules we have already established , where @xmath80 is the number of star operators cut by the boundary .",
    "star operators cut near the surface are not treated differently from those cut in the bulk .",
    "we now consider the entanglement entropy for the case where the region touches the rough face .",
    "contrary to the cases we have considered previously , we do not find a topological contribution to the entanglement entropy .",
    "as such , we describe this calculation in detail .",
    "we show a picture of the restricted stabilizer graph in fig.[roughfaceball ] . unlike the previous graphs we have considered , here we have edges that have only one adjacent vertex .",

    "these edges represent restricted plaquette operators that anti commute with only one restricted star operator , denoted by their single incident vertex in the graph .",
    "such plaquette operators are found at the rough boundary of the 3d toric code .",
    "we show the extended circuit rule in fig.[roughendcircuit ] .",
    "the restriced plaquette operator represented by the missing edge on the right hand side of this equality has been replaced by the product of all restricted plaquette operators represented by solid edges on the left hand side of the figure , such that the new generator commutes with all the vertices of the graph .",
