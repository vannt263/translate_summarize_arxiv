    "they interpret this as either the half or full binary orbital period .",
    "either case is consistent with the known orbital period range of be/  binary pulsars .",
    "given its probable orbital period and the outburst characteristics , xte  j1946 + 274  is most likely another example of a be star/  binary pulsar transient .",
    "this class of binaries accounts for over half of the known accreting pulsars @xcite .",

    "during the xte  j1946 + 274  outburst , 12 pointed observations were made with the proportional counter array ( pca ) and the high energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ) on - board the _ rxte _  ( see tab .",
    "[ t : obs ] and fig .",
    "[ f : asmlc ] ) .",
    "the pca @xcite is a set of five xenon proportional counter units ( pcus ) sensitive in the energy range 260kev with a total effective area of 7000@xmath10 .",
    "the hexte  @xcite consists of two arrays ( `` clusters a and b '' ) of 4 nai(tl)/csi(na ) phoswich scintillation counters ( 15250kev ) totaling 1600 .",
    "early in the mission , the pulse height analyzer of a single cluster b phoswich failed , making the effective area of cluster b approximately 3/4 of cluster a. the hexte  clusters alternate pointing between target and nearby blank fields in order to measure the background .",
    "the pca and hexte  fields of view are collimated to the same 1  full width half maximum ( fwhm ) region . in order to extend the life of the pca detectors , most observations",
    "are currently made with one or more pcus turned off .",
    "all the observations here were performed with pcus 0 , 1 , and 2 on .",
    "because pcus 3 and 4 were sometimes off , they have been excluded from this analysis .",
    "[ f : asmlc ]",
    "for each observation , we accumulated source and background spectra from the pca standard 2 data and the hexte  event mode data .",
    "we used the ftools 5.0.1 and the procedures detailed by @xcite . in order to take advantage of the best pca calibrations",
    ", we limited the data to detector layer 1 only .",
    "we summed the spectra for the 3 active pcus to form a single pulse height spectrum .",
    "we used the bright source background model ( appropriate for the counting rate of xte  j1946 + 274 ) to estimate the pca background . because of the high pca counting rate of xte  j1946 + 274  and the duration of the observations , the statistical errors in the energy spectra ( @xmath11 ) were small compared to the uncertainties in the instrument calibration .",
    "it was therefore necessary to include systematic uncertainties on the pca data in order to achieve a reasonable fit to the data .",
    "we determined the size of these errors through the procedures recommended by the pca team @xcite and explained in @xcite . in short ,",
    "we fit contemporaneous observations of the crab nebula and pulsar to a two power law model , using the xte  j1946 + 274response matrices .",
    "this model allows for different power law indices for the pulsar and nebular components @xcite .",
    "we adjusted the systematic errors until a reduced chi - squared of one was achieved  at a level of 0.3% per channel below 20kev . above 20kev , the systematic errors became unacceptably large , @xmath125% , so we chose to ignore these pca data , rather than apply large systematic errors .         a clear correlation exists between the line energy and spectral cut - off indicating that the cut - off is related to the magnetic field . @xcite and",
    "@xcite first noted this relationship by plotting cyclotron line energies from  and other instruments , derived with a variety of continuum models , against the plcut cut - off energy from sometimes non - contemporaneous  observations .",
    "they found that the relationship was consistent with a power law , @xmath13 ( or , @xmath14 ) , indicating a saturation as compared to a linear correlation .",
    "figure  [ f : ecutvsecyc ] has the advantage that each point is derived from a uniform model fit to a single spectrum . and , with the exception of a0535 + 26 , all points are from the same set of instruments .",
    "xte  j1946 + 274  fits nicely on the correlation , and below 30kev , the slope is consistent with @xmath15",
    ". however , there appears to be a break in the relationship above 30kev .",
    "this flattening is more abrupt than the smooth turnover of the @xmath16 power law suggesting that the processes that form the continuum saturate at higher magnetic fields .",
    "with xte  j1946 + 274 , we have added a 13@xmath17 accreting pulsar to the list of objects with secure cyclotron line detections .",
    "nearly all of these have been confirmed , and several were discovered , with _ rxte _  and _ _ beppo__sax .",
    "we have now begun detailed studies of these objects as a class . in particular , since ten of the thirteen sources have been observed with _",
    ", we are applying uniform analyses to all these objects to further understand the line forming regions .",
    "first results of such studies , including correlations between other line parameters , are given in @xcite .",
