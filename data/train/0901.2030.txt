    "establishing the precise mechanism of the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak gauge symmetry is indeed a central focus of the activity in the area of high energy physics and , certainly , one of the primary goals of the large hadron collider , the lhc , which will soon start operation . in the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) is achieved via the higgs mechanism @xcite , wherein the neutral component of an isodoublet scalar field acquires a non  zero vacuum expectation value .",
    "this gives rise to nonzero masses for the fermions and the electroweak gauge bosons , which are otherwise not allowed by the @xmath0 symmetry . in the sector of the theory with broken symmetry ,",
    "one of the four degrees of freedom of the original isodoublet field , corresponds to a physical particle : the higgs boson with @xmath1 quantum numbers under parity and charge conjugation @xcite .    clearly , the discovery of this last missing piece of the sm is a matter of profound importance .",
    "in fact , in spite of the phenomenal success of the sm in explaining the precision data  @xcite , the sm can not be considered to be established completely until the higgs particle is observed experimentally and , further , its fundamental properties such as its mass , spin and other quantum numbers , as well as its couplings to various matter and gauge particles and its self - couplings are established .",
    "these studies are important not only to establish the sm as the correct theory of fundamental particles and interactions among them , but also to achieve further clarity into the dynamics of the ewsb mechanism .",
    "indeed , in spite of the success of the idea of spontaneous symmetry breaking ( in fact , partly honoured by the nobel prize of 2008 ) in different areas of physics , very little is known about its realisation in particle physics via the higgs mechanism .",
    "the many important questions which one would like answered are : does the dynamics involve new strong interactions and is the higgs a composite field ?",
    "if elementary higgs particles indeed exist in nature , how many fields are there and in which gauge representations do they appear ? does the ewsb sector involve sizable cp violation ? etc .",
    "theoretical realizations span a wide range of scenarios extending from weak to strong breaking mechanisms , including the so called higgsless theories in extra dimensional models . as far as the representations of the gauge group are concerned",
    ", there is again a whole range starting from models involving light fundamental higgs fields , arising from an su(2 ) doublet , such as in the sm and its supersymmetric extensions which include two  higgs doublets in the minimal version , to those containing additional singlet fields or higher representations in extended versions in unified theories and/or alternative theories such as little higgs models .",
    "furthermore , the link between particle physics and cosmology means that the ewsb mechanism can have implications for the generation of the baryon ",
    "antibaryon asymmetry in the early universe and could play an important role in the annihilation of the new particles that are responsible for the cosmological dark matter and thus impact their density in the universe today .",
    "in fact , possible cp violation in the higgs sector can have a direct bearing on the two cosmology issues mentioned above .",
    "an understanding of the ewsb mechanism at a more fundamental level might also hold clues about why the three generations of quarks and leptons have masses which differ from each other ; the so called flavour issue .",
    "a complete discussion of higgs physics thus touches upon almost all the issues under active investigation in theoretical and experimental particle physics .",
    "in the sm there exists only one isodoublet complex scalar field and , thus , there are initially four real scalar fields @xcite .",
    "after spontaneous ewsb , we are left with one physical degree of freedom , the higgs scalar and the other three would  be nambu - goldstone bosons are absorbed to build up the longitudinal components of the @xmath2 gauge bosons and generate their masses .",
    "yukawa interactions of the fermions with the same scalar field give rise to the fermion masses .",
    "the higgs scalar has @xmath3 assignments of spin , parity and charge conjugation quantum numbers .",
    "the higgs couplings to the fermions and gauge bosons are related to the masses of these particles and are thus decided by the symmetry breaking mechanism . in contrast , the mass of the higgs boson itself is completely undetermined in the model .",
    "there are , however , both experimental and theoretical constraints on this fundamental parameter , which we will summarize below .",
    "one available direct information on the higgs mass is the lower limit @xmath4 $ \\sim$}}~}114.4 $ ] gev at 95% confidence level ( c.l . )",
    "established at lep2 @xcite .",
    "the collaborations have also reported a small , @xmath5 $ \\sim$}}~}2 \\sigma$ ] , excess of events beyond the expected sm backgrounds , consistent with a sm  like higgs boson with a mass @xmath6 gev @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , the tevatron physics potential for the discovery of higgs particles looks promising , with the coming larger data sets . in particular , evidence for the sm higgs boson",
    "could be obtained if the mass is near the observed experimental lower limit from lep of about @xmath7 gev or if it is near 160 gev .",
    "in fact , with the run - ii data collected by both the experiments , corresponding to @xmath8 fb@xmath9 , the observed upper limits are a factor @xmath10 higher than the expected sm higgs cross section at @xmath11 gev at @xmath12 c.l .  @xcite .    furthermore , the high accuracy of the electroweak data measured at lep , slc and the tevatron @xcite provides an indirect sensitivity to @xmath13 : the higgs boson contributes logarithmically , @xmath14 , to the radiative corrections to the @xmath15 boson propagators . a recent analysis , which uses the updated determination of the top quark mass ( @xmath16 gev ) , yields the value @xmath17 gev , corresponding to a 95% confidence level upper limit of @xmath18 $ \\sim$}}~}154 $ ] gev @xcite .",

    "interesting constraints can be derived from assumptions on the energy range within which the sm is valid before perturbation theory breaks down and new phenomena would emerge .",
    "for instance , if the higgs mass were larger than @xmath22 1 tev , the @xmath23 and @xmath24 bosons would have to interact very strongly with each other so that their scattering at high energies respects unitarity . imposing the unitarity requirement in the high  energy scattering of gauge bosons leads to the bound @xmath18 $ \\sim$}}~}700 $ ] gev @xcite .",
    "if the higgs boson were too heavy , unitarity would be violated in these processes at energies above @xmath25 $ \\sim$}}~}1.2 $ ] tev and new phenomena should appear to restore it .",
    "it is interesting to note , as an aside , that just the requirement of perturbative unitarity in @xmath26 scattering leads to a model with exactly the same particle content and couplings as the sm  @xcite .",
    "another important theoretical constraint comes from the fact that the quartic higgs self  coupling , which at the scale @xmath13 is fixed by @xmath13 itself , grows logarithmically with the energy scale .",
    "if @xmath13 is small , the energy cut  off @xmath27 at which the coupling grows beyond any bound and new phenomena should occur , is large ; if @xmath13 is large , the cut  off",
    "@xmath27 is small .",

    "furthermore , loops involving top quarks tend to drive the coupling to negative values for which the vacuum is no longer stable .",

    "such a higgs particle can be thus produced at the lhc .    once its mass is fixed the profile of the higgs particle is uniquely determined and its production rates and decay widths are fixed .",

    "the first one is the so  called naturalness problem : the radiative corrections to @xmath13 being quadratically divergent push the higgs boson mass to be the order of these large scales .",
    "the second problem is that the running of the three gauge couplings of the sm is such that they do not meet at a single point and thus do not unify at the gut scale .",
    "low energy supersymmetry solves these two problems at once @xcite : supersymmetric particle loops cancel exactly the quadratic divergences and help stablise the higgs boson mass at the weak scale , and they contribute to the running of the gauge couplings to allow their unification at @xmath42 .",
    "in addition , it allows for a good candidate for the dark matter in the universe .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) , requires the existence of two isodoublet higgs fields to cancel anomalies and to give mass separately to up and down  type fermions .",
    "two cp  even neutral higgs bosons @xmath43 , a pseudoscalar @xmath44 boson and a pair of charged scalar particles , @xmath45 , are introduced by this extension of the higgs sector @xcite .",
    "in fact , in this case , the scalar potential does not involve an arbitrary self coupling @xmath46 as is the case with the sm , but involves only the gauge couplings and as a result the mass of the lightest higgs boson @xmath47 is bounded from above .",
    "besides the four masses , the properties of the higgs sector in the mssm are determined by two more parameters : a mixing angle @xmath48 in the neutral cp  even sector and the ratio of the two vacuum expectation values @xmath49 .",

    "the dot - dashed ( red ) curve and the dotted ( green ) curve are for states with cp violating couplings @xmath466 , @xmath470 with @xmath469 and @xmath471 , respectively  @xcite.,width=264 ]    as an example , we show in fig .  [ hcp : mixphilhc ] the distribtuion in azimuthal angle @xmath472 , for @xmath473 gev , where @xmath64 corresponds to a higgs which may have indeterminate cp assignments .",
    "it should be kept in mind though , that this method can not be applied for very large higgs masses where this dependence is washed out .",
    "one must also beware of degenerate higgs bosons of opposite cp ; since the decay products are the same , they will both contribute to the rate and must be summed coherently , possibly mimicking the effect seen above .",
    "also , in the context of lhc with the qcd environment and modifications to shapes of distributions , it is useful to construct specific observables which may be directly proportional to the anomalous part of the coupling , as was done in the @xmath407 case recently  @xcite .    parameterising the anomalous vertex by @xmath474 , \\nonumber \\label{param}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath475 and @xmath476",
    ", @xmath477 denotes the weak - mixing angle and @xmath478 is the totally antisymmetric tensor with @xmath479 , one can develop a strategy to probe different parts of the anomalous couplings @xmath480 and @xmath481 directly .",
    "the general strategy is to construct different observables out of the available 4-momenta such that they have specific cp and @xmath482 transformation properties , using partially integrated cross - sections , where @xmath482 denotes naive time reversal .",
    "then , the expectation value of the sign of this observable , which will correspond to partially integrated cross - sections will be directly proportional to the particular anomalous coupling ( or product of these ) which have the same transformation property . in the reasonable approximation of small anomalous couplings ,",
    "these observables will then directly probe different anomalous couplings    one example of such an observable is the cosine of the angle @xmath483 made by the decay lepton with the @xmath24 direction in the rest frame of the higgs boson .",
    "one can write @xmath484 for the decay @xmath485 .",
    "the expectation value of the sign is @xmath486 this is @xmath487 and is thus a direct probe of nonzero value for it and hence of cp violation .",
    "for example , for @xmath473 gev , values of @xmath116 of about @xmath488 are possible .",
    "[ hcp : mixcpa1 ] shows the sensitivity of such a measurement for atlas with an integrated luminosity of @xmath453 fb@xmath9 for a scalar of mass 200 gev .",
    "one can , in fact , systematically construct observables , using this strategy , to probe the different parts of the anomalous couplings separately .",
    "thus , in principle , with high luminosities it will be possible to map the anomalous @xmath489 couplings at the lhc at the level of @xmath490@xmath491 . of course , this precision is no comparison to what will be achievable at the ilc , as can be seen , for example , from recent discussions in refs .",
    "@xcite .     as a function of @xmath492 , for a higgs boson of mass 200  gev .",
    "we chose the cp - even coupling coefficient @xmath466 and @xmath470 .",
    "the inserts show the same quantities for a larger range of @xmath492  @xcite.,width=264,height=177 ]    in short , all the discussions above indicate that while lhc with @xmath453 fb@xmath9 data per experiment can perform measurements of different higgs properties , it is really to the ilc  @xcite that we have to look to for precision information .",
