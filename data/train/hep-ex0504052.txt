    "because strong interactions are flavour - independent , it would appear that they can be equally well studied in the spectroscopy of light or heavy quarks . however , the highly relativistic nature of quarks in light - quark ( @xmath2 ) hadrons , the large value of the strong coupling constant , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , and the near equality of the masses of the @xmath2 quarks , makes the light quark states strongly overlapping , with small spacing @xmath5 mev , large widths , @xmath6 mev , and mostly mixtures of all three flavours .",
    "in contrast , @xmath0 and @xmath1 hadrons are relatively free from these problems , with @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and have well resolved states ( spacing@xmath9 mev , @xmath10 mev ) .",
    "the spectra of @xmath11 charmonium and @xmath12 bottominium are illustrated in fig",
    "the history of quarkonia began with the discovery of @xmath13 in 1974 and lots of @xmath1 charmonium discovery physics was done by slac , desy , and orsay during the next ten years . because only vector states can be directly formed in @xmath14 annihilations , in these experiments precision results could be obtained for vector states ( @xmath13 , @xmath15 ) , but this was often not the case with other states ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) .",
    "this shortcoming was at least partially removed by charmonium spectroscopy with @xmath18 annihilation in which states of all @xmath19 could be directly formed . in",
    "the fermilab experiments e760/e835 precision mass and width measurements were made of @xmath20 states ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the limitations imposed by the available luminosity , and the absence of charged particle tracking limited even these experiments in the pursuit of the spectroscopy of spin - singlet states , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 . in 1989 the bepc ( beijing ) brought large @xmath14 luminosity to bear on the spectroscopy of charmonium , and its bes detector has made notable contributations to improving the precision achieved in earlier @xmath14 experiments .",
    "the spin - singlet states still remained mostly out of the reach of bes . a very favourable development has , however , taken place in the last few years .",
    "the cesr accelerator at cornell , which had operated since 1979 in the 911 gev region , and had made important contributions in the spectroscopy of @xmath0 bottomonium , has been converted to cesr - c , designed to work optimally in the 35 gev region .",
    "it is beginning to make measurements in the charmonium region with the great advantage offered by its excellent detector which has been upgraded from cleo ii to iii to cleo - c . also the huge @xmath14 luminosities available at kek",
    "( belle detector ) and slac ( babar detector ) are making it possible to produce very competative results in charmominium spectroscopy , even as they run exclusively at @xmath27 . to complete this historical narrative ,",
    "let me mention that at gsi ( darmstadt ) a dedicated facility for @xmath18 experiments in the @xmath28 gev region is being built , and in beijing the construction of bepc - ii and bes - iii has been approved .",
    "we can therefore look forward to a very bright future for the spectroscopy of this mass region , which not only includes charmonium but also the qcd exotics , glueballs , hybrids , and whatever else lies there hidden .",
    "despite the fact that the bottomonium @xmath0 system is certainly more amenable to pqcd , we know far less about bottomonium than we know about charmonium .",
    "the @xmath29 , ground state of bottomonium , has not been identified so far . the vector states @xmath30 and @xmath31 are known but only one hadronic transition from these , @xmath32 has ever been observed .",
    "radiative transitions @xmath33 states have been observed .",
    "no d - states , which are expected to be bound ( see fig .",
    "1 ) have been observed .",
    "no hadronic transition from any @xmath34 states has ever been observed .",
    "recently , cleo has made small gains in both the above problems .",
    "the @xmath35 state has been successfully observed in 4-photon cascade @xmath36 . the mass @xmath37 mev@xcite . in another measurement",
    ", @xmath38 has also been observed@xcite .",
    "in addition , precision measurements have been made by cleo @xcite for the leptonic branching fractions of @xmath39 states .",
    "it is found that while @xmath40 ( see table 1 ) is in agreement with the current pdg @xcite average , those for @xmath41 and @xmath42 are 55% and 35% larger , respectively .",
    "this leads to a corresponding decrease in total widths .",
    "precision measurements of radiative decays of @xmath43 , @xmath44 are also being made .    [",
    "cols=\">,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]        from bes @xcite and crystal ball @xcite .",
    "the fits are from ref .",
    "@xcite.,width=336 ]      according to pqcd , in any hard - scattering process total hadron helicity should be conserved , i.e. , @xmath45 it follows that in the annihilation of nucleon - antinucleon carrying opposite helicities @xmath46 state can not be produced .",
    "accordingly , while @xmath47 is allowed , @xmath48 is forbidden .",
    "similarly , while @xmath49 is allowed , @xmath50 is forbidden .",
    "however , these predictions of forbidden transitions are strongly violated .",
    "we see that @xmath51 is suppressed only by factor 2 compared to @xmath52 .",
    "more dramatically , @xmath53 is enhanced by a factor 5 compared to @xmath54 .",
    "it is not clear what lies behind these gross violations of the hadron helicity conservation ` rule ' .",
    "the qcd sector of the standard model has received impressive experimental support in the perturbative domain of very large @xmath55 .",
    "however , the universal truth of qcd , which must include its validity in the small @xmath55 domain , remains an open question .",
    "wilczek , for example , has emphasized that , `` if you are interested in quantitative results for @xmath3 , ( which provide ) a quantitative measure of how good pqcd is , there is a large premium for working at small @xmath55 . ''",
    "the small @xmath55 , or small mass scale that wilczek has in mind , is not the scale of @xmath56- and @xmath57-quarks , because they present very difficult ( e.g. , relativistic ) problems .",
    "it is the scale of @xmath58-quarks , which are heavy enough , but where @xmath3 is already run to nearly 3 times its value at @xmath59 .",
    "the best way to obtain @xmath60 is to make ratios in which the two unknowns , @xmath61 and the wave functions at the origin cancel out .",
    "thus from @xmath62 we get @xmath63 for @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , for @xmath66 , for an average value of @xmath67        figure 4 shows the @xmath3 measurements .",
    "our @xmath68 ( at @xmath69 gev ) agrees well with @xmath70 from @xmath71 decay ( at @xmath72 gev ) .",
    "our result corresponds to @xmath73 , whereas the pdg98 average is : @xmath74    i must point out that there is a serious caveat associated with the nice value of @xmath3 at @xmath75 plotted in fig .",
    "it has been obtained by using first order radiative correction factors of @xmath76 and 1.9 to the lowest order pqcd predictions for the branching ratios .",
    "such large factors are admittedly highly suspect .",
    "with cleo iii having converted to cleo - c there is not much prospect of new runs for bottomonium spectroscopy . of course , cleo will continue to mine whatever good bottomonium physics it can from the @xmath77 fb@xmath78 data it has on @xmath39 .",
    "the prospects for charmonium spectroscopy are better , and we can look forward to lots of precision results from cleo - c running at @xmath79 and @xmath80 ."
