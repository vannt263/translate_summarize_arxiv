    "the complete formulation for superstring field theory has been the important problem . however , the action in the same form as well - understood bosonic string field theory@xcite has some disadvantages : divergences and broken gauge invariance@xcite . to construct a gauge invariant action",
    "consistently , various approaches have been proposed@xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on two formulations : wess - zumino - witten - like ( wzw - like ) formulation and @xmath5-type formulation , and discuss their equivalence .",
    "the wzw - like formulation@xcite is one of the successful approaches .",
    "the theory is formulated by using the string field which belongs to the state space spanned by bosonized superconformal ghosts @xmath6 : the large hilbert space .",
    "the resultant action has the different form that the bosonic one and is invariant under the large gauge transformation .",
    "the largeness of the state space and the gauge symmetry suggests this approach would be more fundamental . on the other hand",
    ", however , it makes the construction of a classical batalin - vilkovisky ( bv ) master action complicated , and the quantization of wzw - like theory remains mysterious .",
    "the alternative one is the @xmath5-type formulation proposed in @xcite .",
    "the action consists of an infinite set of string products satisfying @xmath5-relations and the string field belonging to the subspace of the large hilbert space annihilated by the zero - mode of @xmath7-current : the small hilbert space .",
    "the @xmath5-relations arises the nilpotent gauge invariance , and therefore , one can carry out the classical bv quantization of the action in a straightforward way .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the relation between these two formulations for ns closed string field theory .",
    "first , we show that the ns string products @xmath1 in @xmath2-type formulation and the shifted brst operator @xmath3 in wzw - like formulation both are obtained by similarity transformations of the brst operator @xmath4 . utilizing invertible maps @xmath8 and",
    "@xmath9 , one can write @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a @xmath13-fold multilinear map . then , combining these invertible maps , we construct @xmath14 and obtain the similarity transformation connecting @xmath3 and @xmath15 @xmath16 second , we consider a morphism of @xmath2-algebras which is given by the similarity transformation .",
    "we also show that there exists a natural field redefinition induced by the @xmath2-morphism @xmath17 @xmath18 which is the key ingredient to discuss the on - shell equivalence .",
    "since the @xmath2-morphism @xmath17 maps the state @xmath19 to the state @xmath20 , the zeros of @xmath21 becomes equivalent to the zeros of @xmath22 unless @xmath23 . by identifying these zeros with the on - shell condition of string field theory",
    ", we try to clarify the relation of two formulations .",
    "one can write @xmath24 for the on - shell condition in @xmath2-type formulation and @xmath25 for that in wzw - like formulation , where the associated field @xmath26 is a function of large - space string fields @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , the identification @xmath28 provides the on - shell equivalence of @xmath2-type and wzw - like formulations .",
    "furthermore , we show that at least up to quartic order , this identification @xmath29 also provides the off - shell equivalence of two formulations for ns closed superstring field theory .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly review a coalgebraic description of a cyclic @xmath2-algebra , which plays an important role in the action for ( super- ) string field theory .",
    "the technique of coalgebraic operations is a key tool in this paper . in section 3 , first we introduce the concept of the path - ordered integral of multilinear maps , an iterated integral with directions . then , we construct the ns string products @xmath15 and the shifted brst operator @xmath3 by appropriate similarity transformations of the brst operator @xmath4 .",
    "this is the first result in this paper .",
    "as we will see in section 4 , the similarity transformation naturally induces a morphism of two @xmath2-algebras . using this morphism",
    ", one can derive the explicit form of the field redefinition @xmath29 providing the on - shell equivalence of two formulations .",
    "furthermore , we find that at least up to quartic order , @xmath29 also provides the off - shell equivalence of two formulations .",
    "then , a partial - gauge - fixing condition giving @xmath2-relations in wzw - like formulation naturally appears , which leads us to the idea that by choosing partial - gauge - fixing conditions of the wzw - like action , one can obtain any corresponding @xmath2-type actions .",
    "we end with conclusion and discussion .",
