    "when the atom is placed very close to the boundary ( @xmath153 ) , the total transition rate @xmath179 and @xmath180 , so the decoherence is inhibited to some degree as compared to the unbounded case .",
    "if the atom is placed at @xmath155 , the total transition rate @xmath175 and @xmath147 , which leads to the bounded case reduces to the unbounded case as expected .",
    "if the atom is placed at @xmath152 , we can get the total transition rate @xmath181 and @xmath182 , which means that the decoherence enhances and the quantum coherence decreases faster than that the unbounded case .",
    "thus , the @xmath162 decreases as the total transition rate @xmath156 increases , resulting in the decoherence enhances with the atomic position @xmath68 increases .",
    "@xmath0 _ norm of coherence is depicted in fig .",
    "( [ f8 ] ) as a function of @xmath60 at different atomic position @xmath68 for @xmath176 with temperature @xmath164 and @xmath165 respectively .",
    "similarly , we can see from the fig .",
    "( [ f8 ] ) that the quantum coherence decreases faster as the temperature increases . as expected , we noted that the properties of the relative entropy of coherence is similar to the _ @xmath0 _ norm of coherence .",
    "we have concerned about the conditions under which the decoherence can be inhibited effectively from noise environment in the open quantum systems .",
    "we have studied the dynamics of the quantum coherence of a two - level atom coupled with the electromagnetic field with the finite temperature . in this paper",
    "three cases are considered detaily : without boundaries , with the presence of a boundary , and the presence of two parallel boundaries . in the case without boundaries , the decoherence can not be inhibited .",
    "besides , the @xmath62 decreases when the temperature increases , i.e. , the higher temperature leads to a faster decoherence . in the case with the presence of a boundary , the quantum coherence",
    "not only depends on the temperature , but also depends on the atomic position and polarization direction .",
    "we found that the @xmath183 may be decreased , increased or even remain unchanged as compared to the unbounded case .",
    "that is to say , the decoherence may be enhanced , inhibited or unchanged as compared to the results for the free space .",
    "only when the atom is close to the boundary and the transversely polarization , the @xmath184 and the decoherence can be inhibited effectively at any finite temperature , which makes the quantum coherence can be protected highly . and in the case with the presence of two parallel boundaries , we find that the quantum coherence is also related to the distance between the two boundaries .",
    "two different situations , the distance between the boundaries is @xmath185 or @xmath186 , are considered carefully .",
    "when the distance between the two boundaries is @xmath185 , we find that the quantum coherence has nothing to do with the atomic position and the decoherence can be inhibited totally at any finite temperature when the atomic polarization is in the @xmath138 plane , which leads to the quantum coherence is shielded from the influence of environment . however , when the distance between the boundaries is @xmath186 , the decoherence can be inhibited effectively only when the atom is close to the boundary and is transversely polarizable .",
