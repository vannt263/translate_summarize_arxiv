    "the splitting of the wave packets into two parts which propagate with unequal group velocity and have different angular momentum polarizations , appears due to the presence of the light and heavy holes states in the expansion the initial wave packet . as usual , the splitting is accompanied by the packet broadening which appears due to the effect of dispersion .    the zb is a result of interference and a complex space - time evolution of two parts of wave packet . in another extreme case , when the inequality @xmath6 takes place , the oscillations of the probability density at the circumference of the wave packet are closely related to the interference of heavy- and light - hole states located in vicinity of the point @xmath93 in the momentum space ( see fig.2 ) .",
