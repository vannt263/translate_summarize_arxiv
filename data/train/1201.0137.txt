    "<S> a gravitational mirror is a non - singular finite redshift surface which bounces all incident null geodesics . </S>",
    "<S> while a white mirror ( outward bouncing ) resembles t hooft s brick wall , a black mirror ( inward bouncing ) offers a novel mechanism for sealing off curvature singularities . </S>",
    "<S> the geometry underlying a two - sided mirror is characterized by a single signature change , to be contrasted with the signature flip which governs the black hole geometry . to demonstrate the phenomenon analytically </S>",
    "<S> , we first derive an exact , static , radially symmetric , two - sided mirror solution , which asymptotes the massless btz black hole background , and then probe the local structure of a massive mirror .    </S>",
    "<S> a signature change in the metric of spacetime plays a fundamental role in general relativity and beyond . </S>",
    "<S> first and foremost in black hole physics , where crossing the horizon is accompanied by the signature flip (= double signature change ) @xmath0 , with the dots representing unchanged spacelike signatures . still , as is evident from the finiteness of the various curvature scalars , the horizon itself is a non - singular surface . </S>",
    "<S> the cosmological example is provided by hartle - hawking no - boundary proposal @xcite , originally invoked in an attempt to bypass the classical big bang singularity . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum creation of the universe is then described in terms of a smooth euclidean to lorentzian transition governed by the single signature change @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> it has even been argued that , for discontinuous signature - changing metrics @xcite , one can derive the field equations from a suitable variational principle . </S>",
    "<S> this paper is devoted to a signature change of a third type , namely @xmath2 , introducing a novel black configuration , to be referred to as a two - sided mirror , a non - singular finite redshift surface which bounces all incident null geodesics .    </S>",
    "<S> let our starting point be the action principle @xmath3 working in 3-dim is just a matter of choice , allowing us to make our point by means of an exact analytic solution ; the 4-dim conclusions although very similar , are based at this stage , on numerical plotting and analytic probing at the near mirror zone . </S>",
    "<S> similar actions have been successfully used in 2-dim black hole physics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the primary role of the scalar potential @xmath4 is to ensure a stable general relativistic vacuum solution . </S>",
    "<S> this can be done by letting the dilation field @xmath5 acquire a constant vacuum expectation value @xmath6 , with @xmath7 denoting the 3-dim newton constant . supplementing the action by brans - dicke kinetic @xmath8-term is optional , but even in its absence ( without losing generality ) </S>",
    "<S> , the dilation field is still dynamical . </S>",
    "<S> associated with the above action are the field equations @xmath9 by tracing the former gravitational field equations , and then substituting the ricci scalar into the latter equation , one infers that the klein gordon equation of the dilation field , namely @xmath10 , is governed by the derivative of the effective potential @xmath11 the simplest choice by far , namely a linear @xmath4 , ( i ) does not have an equivalent @xmath12 gravity @xcite representation , ( ii ) dictates a constant ricci curvature solution , and ( iii ) is sufficient for inducing a quadratic @xmath13 , that is @xmath14 stability , meaning an effective potential bounded from below , then requires @xmath15 , which signals a necessarily negative cosmological constant @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> note that adding a conformal piece @xmath17 to @xmath4 keeps the effective potential @xmath13 unchanged , with the sole effect being then a shift @xmath18 in the size of the cosmological constant .    </S>",
    "<S> the most general line element admitting @xmath19 killing vectors takes the generic form @xmath20 for the sake of the present paper , however , the radially symmetric case @xmath21 will do . </S>",
    "<S> re - arranging the field equations , we face a set of three differential equations , two of which are second order , and one of which is independent of the scalar potential , namely @xmath22 constant @xmath23 is obviously a solution , the vacuum solution in fact . </S>",
    "<S> the associated general relativistic metric @xmath24 where @xmath25 , constitutes the btz black hole metric @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> apart from its negative cosmological constant @xmath16 , the btz solution is characterized by a positive adm mass @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> intriguingly , the ads limit is achieved for @xmath27 , indicating a mass gap of @xmath28 from the black hole continuum states . </S>",
    "<S> the outer and the inner horizons , as well as the infinite redshift surface , which characterize the more general @xmath29 metric , merge in this case , at @xmath30 , into a single event horizon . for the sake of the present paper </S>",
    "<S> , it is worth emphasizing the well known fact that although crossing the horizon is associated with a signature flip , namely @xmath31 , the horizon surface is nonetheless free of any curvature singularity .    in this paper , however , we are interested in the non general relativistic @xmath32 solution . following the klein gordon equation , a tiny deviation from the vacuum expectation value , that is @xmath33 , </S>",
    "<S> is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 are two constants of integration . </S>",
    "<S> the choice @xmath36 is then dictated by the boundary requirement of asymptotically approaching the general relativistic @xmath37 btz background . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding full large-@xmath38 expansion , subject to the btz boundary condition @xmath39 at infinity , is explicitly given by @xmath40 the coefficients of the various @xmath41 terms are polynomials of suitable dimensions in @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> a closer inspection reveals that the limit @xmath43 is mathematically very special . </S>",
    "<S> the metric components @xmath44 acquire in this limit their full analytical form , leading to the exact solution and very simple solution @xmath45 provided the associated scalar field @xmath46 obeys the first - order differential equation @xmath47 it can be easily verified that , with eq.([f(r ) ] ) satisfied , the two remaining second - order differential field equations get automatically respected , _ irrespective of the particular solution chosen_.    the special case @xmath48 catches our attention ( note that the conceptually different @xmath49 case , in particular the @xmath50 limit , has been discussed in the literature in the context of maximal entropy packing @xcite ) . the metric eq.([smetric ] ) is apparently singular at @xmath51 , where even the scalar density @xmath52 happens to explode . but this turns out to be an artifact , as can be deduced from the values of the various curvature scalars @xmath53 which stay all finite and continuous on the @xmath51 surface . moreover , with eq.([f(r ) ] ) satisfied , this surface stays non - singular even in the einstein frame where @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath55 , the real curvature singularity is solely located at the origin . </S>",
    "<S> while the overall situation partially reminds us of a black hole , it is quite obvious that the @xmath51 surface can be anything but an event horizon . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath51 surface is characterized by the harmless single signature change @xmath56 , the nature of which we now attempt to reveal .    </S>",
    "<S> focusing on the @xmath48 case , we find it convenient to set @xmath57 from this point on . </S>",
    "<S> starting in the @xmath58 region , eq.([f(r ) ] ) admits there the exact analytic solution @xmath59 the upper limit of the integration interval is nothing but the choice @xmath60 applied earlier in eq.([asymptotic ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> a technical difficulty is that the hypergeometric function @xmath61 has a branch cut discontinuity in the complex z - plane running from 1 to @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the _ independent _ solution @xmath63 of eq.([f(r ) ] ) , at the region @xmath64 , must be stitched to @xmath65 precisely on the @xmath66 surface . </S>",
    "<S> eq.([f(r ) ] ) is a first order differential equation , and as such , its solutions can be stitched at almost any point just on continuity arguments . in our case , however , the junction value @xmath67 is dictated by the differential equation eq.([f(r ) ] ) itself , and is not subject to any boundary conditions . to see the point , </S>",
    "<S> notice the approximate expansions @xmath68 we note in passing that a perfectly smooth transition would require @xmath69 , with the price being @xmath70 at large distances . </S>",
    "<S> insisting , however , on @xmath71 at spatial infinity , the exact value @xmath72 can be calculated directly from eq.([fplus ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that @xmath73 diverges like @xmath74 is not alarming , given that @xmath75 is finite . by the same token , @xmath76 diverges like @xmath77 , but as is evident from the klein gordon equation , @xmath78 is finite and continuous . while the value of @xmath79 has not been fixed at this stage , notice that the metric eq.([smetric ] ) is independent of the particular choices of @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as we shall soon see , it is eq.([smetric ] ) that tells us that the two @xmath81-regions do not communicate geodesically . </S>",
    "<S> choosing @xmath82 , we can calculate @xmath63 , and find @xmath83 where @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> the combined @xmath85 , the reciprocal ( normalized ) effective newton constant , is depicted in fig.[fig1 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> , is plotted as a function of the circumferential radius @xmath38 . the asymptotic behavior @xmath86 , and the matching at the gravitational mirror are emphasized . ]    </S>",
    "<S> back to the metric eq.([smetric ] ) , we now reveal the special physical features which characterize the @xmath87 surface . as hinted by the associated signature change @xmath88 , it is worthwhile studying first null geodesics . </S>",
    "<S> the physical properties of light ray trajectories solely depend on the ratio @xmath89 of the conserved angular momentum @xmath90 to the conserved energy @xmath91 . conveniently normalizing the affine parameter @xmath92 , </S>",
    "<S> the null geodesics obey @xmath93 the equivalent mechanical problem involves the effective potential @xmath94 , and a vanishing total mechanical energy . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the sign of @xmath95 , the discussion trifurcates :    @xmath96 @xmath97 null geodesics can only live at the outer region @xmath98 . from the point of view of an external observer , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath87 surface acts like a white mirror , reflecting all incident null geodesics , thus resembling t hooft s brick wall , at least in the susskind - lindesay interpretation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath96 @xmath99 null geodesics , on the other hand , can only survive at the inner region @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> null geodesics hitting the @xmath87 surface from the inside get reflected , and are doomed to spiral into the singularity at the origin . </S>",
    "<S> the light cone structure excludes radial internal geodesics .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath96 this leaves @xmath101 to tag the only closed null geodesic available , which must live of course on the mirror itself . in some sense </S>",
    "<S> , the mirror can be viewed as the locus of `` frustrated '' light rays .    to be contrasted with a black hole event horizon , which serves as a one - way membrane </S>",
    "<S> , no light ray can cross the two - sided gravitational mirror . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , from the point of view of an external observer , the @xmath102 core does not reveal any piece of information , and is in fact black and furthermore impenetrable . this way , gravitational mirroring offers a novel sealing off mechanism of curvature singularities , above and beyond the protection @xcite offered by black holes . to be a bit more specific , an external observer can only probe a bounded kretschmann curvature @xmath103 .    </S>",
    "<S> the null trajectories @xmath104 are governed by the equation @xmath105^{-1/2}~,\\ ] ] a few of them are depicted in fig.[fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> all null geodesics , without exception , are symmetric and can not escape touching the mirror , and unless @xmath106 ( external radial ) , they do it tangentially .     </S>",
    "<S> null geodesics get scattered , internal null geodesics @xmath107 are doomed to spiral into the singularity at the origin . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed @xmath101 concentric circular geodesic marks the two - sided gravitational mirror . ]    we now switch on the mass parameter @xmath108 , and argue , bases on a combined numerical and local analytic analysis , that the gravitational mirror solution , while being correspondingly modified , is still there . </S>",
    "<S> starting from proper boundary conditions at large distances , that is @xmath109 , see eq.([expansion ] ) , the numerical graphs exhibit the exact ( verified numerically ) mirror - like behavior just outside some @xmath110 , thereby implying , following the trail paved by eqs.([expandplus],[expandminus ] ) , the tenable @xmath111 expansion @xmath112 </S>",
    "<S> ~,\\\\      & & \\phi(h+\\epsilon )   =       \\phi_0+\\phi_1 \\sqrt{\\epsilon }      + \\phi_2 \\epsilon+ ... </S>",
    "<S> ~. \\nonumber       \\label{mexpansion}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] indeed , one coefficient is in charge of the general relativistic large @xmath38 behavior of the scalar field , two coefficients are used to extract @xmath108 and @xmath113 from the asymptotic expansion ( note that @xmath114 as @xmath43 ) , another coefficient ( @xmath115 ) gauges the scale of time , and the rest of the coefficients can be calculated order by order . from the zeroth order , for example , we can calculate the location of the mirror in terms of the above coefficients , namely @xmath116 and recall the previous result @xmath117 as @xmath43 , which assures @xmath118 at least for small enough masses . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial observation now is that all curvature scalars are in fact finite at @xmath110 . </S>",
    "<S> one representative example ( the other are very lengthy ) is given by @xmath119 this allows for matching the just outside with the just inside expansions , in the spirit of eqs.([expandplus],[expandminus ] ) , and in accord with the matching procedure @xcite , thereby constituting a non - singular _ massive _ two - sided mirror . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis can be easily extended to an asymptotically flat 4-dim spacetime , with the main difference being the yukawa suppression of the scalar field effect at large distances @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , digesting the latter conclusion , we return to the original massive spinless btz black hole configuration eq.([btz ] ) , and switch on a tiny negative scalar charge , with @xmath120 . </S>",
    "<S> no matter how small @xmath121 is , a phase transition takes place . </S>",
    "<S> the non - singular horizon surface of radius @xmath122 becomes geodesically sealed from both sides , and transforms into a non - singular two - sided gravitational mirror of a slightly larger radius @xmath123 the bottom line is that one black object has replaced the other . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the fact that a black hole is nature s ultimate information storage makes us wonder whether any information leakage has occurred during the phase transition . if the answer to this question is ( even partially ) negative </S>",
    "<S> , then the two - sided gravitational mirror must carry some entropy . </S>",
    "<S> on holographic / geometric grounds @xcite , one may even expect the amount of this entropy to be at most half the circumference of the mirror @xmath124 . at this stage , however , we can not support nor falsify such a possibility by means of a field theoretical calculation . </S>"
