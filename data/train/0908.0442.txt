    "given two probability measures @xmath4 and @xmath5 on some riemannian manifold @xmath6 , a transportation map from @xmath4 to @xmath5 is a map @xmath7 pushing @xmath4 forward @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath8 . in the theory of optimal transportation one is interested in a special transportation map , namely the one minimizing @xmath9 the transportation cost among all possible transportation maps , for a given cost function @xmath10 .",
    "this minimizer , if it exists , is called optimal transportation map . + a voronoi tessellation of a riemannian manifold @xmath6 with respect to a discrete set of points",
    "@xmath11 is a decomposition of @xmath6 into different cells with center @xmath12 .",
    "each cell consists of those points which are closer to its center than to any other center .",
    "a rather natural extension are the laguerre tessellations where different centers can have different weights , see @xcite .",
    "+ the theory of optimal transport is a very natural setting for studying such tessellations . just take @xmath4 as the normalized volume measure , @xmath5 as a convex combination of dirac - measures and as the cost function @xmath13 , the geodesic distance . in this framework",
    "the generalization of laguerre tessellations to other cost functions like @xmath14 is straightforward ( at least to write the tessellation down ) .",
    "+ some of the phenomenons studied in this paper already appeared in the work of ma , trudinger and wang , loeper , kim and mccann ( see @xcite ) , where they studied the regularity of the optimal transport map . in the case above for @xmath15 and the manifold @xmath6 being the hyperbolic disc , the resulting `` cells '' do not have to be connected any more .",
    "if one now smears the dirac points slightly one ends up with a measure which is absolutely continuous to the volume measure ( the density can even be very nice ) but with a discontinuous transportation map ! therefore , even the transport between two measures being absolutely continuous to the volume measure can be rather irregular .      in @xcite mccann showed that on a compact connected complete riemannian manifold @xmath16 without boundary there is always an optimal transport map @xmath17 pushing some measure @xmath4 , absolutely continuous to the volume measure @xmath18 , forward to an arbitrary borel measure @xmath5 on @xmath6 under the condition that the cost function @xmath19 is superdifferentiable .",
    "the map @xmath17 is the exponential of the gradient of a c - convex function @xmath20 .",
    "a function is c - convex iff @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .\\ ] ] we consider the special case of @xmath23 , the normalized volume measure , and @xmath24 , with @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 for all @xmath28 , a ( possibly infinite ) convex combination of dirac measures , and the cost function @xmath29 for @xmath30 , where @xmath31 denotes the geodesic distance between @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "then , the optimal transport map can be written down explicitly , i.e. the c - convex function @xmath20 can be written down explicitly ( the apparent @xmath2-dependence is suppressed in the notation for the optimal transport map ) : @xmath34 in particular , this shows that there is always a solution to the ( even very much generalized ) tessellation problem .",
    "we are interested in the geometry of the mass being allocated to a certain dirac point .",
    "more specific , how does the set @xmath35 , the cell allocated to @xmath36 , look like ?",
    "does is have to be connected ?",
    "+ a nice way to look at these sets is to interprete them as intersections of `` halfspaces '' , i.e. : @xmath37 thus , a good way to study the geometry of the cells @xmath35 is to look for properties invariant under sections of these `` halfspaces '' . in this way we can reduce the problem from a many point problem to a two point problem .",
    "this also directly settles the question of the regularity of the boundary of the cells @xmath35 in the case of finitely many dirac points . to study this regularity",
    ", it suffices to study the regularity of the boundary of the halfspaces @xmath38 .",
    "this question is answered by an implicit function theorem for subdifferentiable functions , e.g. like in the second appendix to chapter 10 in @xcite , and yields    @xmath39 is ( locally ) a @xmath40- dimensional lipschitz graph . for all @xmath41 with @xmath42",
    "there is a neighbourhood @xmath43 of @xmath44 such that @xmath45 is the @xmath40 dimensional graph of a function which is as smooth as the cost function .",
    "thus , the boundary of the set @xmath35 is , as an intersection of sets with locally lipschitz boundary , itself a set with locally lipschitz boundary up to the points of intersection with the different `` halfspaces '' .",
    "in particular , @xmath39 is a @xmath4-null set .",
    "considering just finitely many dirac points , we can thus define the cells @xmath35 to be open . in the case of",
    "inifinitely many dirac points , things become less regular . for example , take a dense countable subset of the unit disc as dirac points . as the different cells are starlike , see section [ general manifolds ] , they become stars consisting of many lines . +",
    "we now turn to the question of the geometry of the cells , and especially the connectedness .",
    "first , we will study the case of compact subsets of @xmath46 .",
    "here we distinguish between convex and non convex subsets because they behave drastically different .",
    "then , in section [ sphere ] we consider the problem on a curved space , the sphere .",
    "it turns out that this case is the nicest .",
    "we can describe the geometry of the cells well and moreover , opposed to the euclidean setting , the cells are connected . in section [ general manifolds ]",
    "we deal with the case @xmath3 which can be treated for all riemannian manifolds yielding laguerre tessellations .",
    "in this section , we will look at compact simply connected subsets @xmath47 of @xmath46 .",
    "let us assume untill explicitly said otherwise that @xmath47 is convex . in the case @xmath15 and finitely many dirac points it was shown in section 4 of @xcite and also in @xcite that the cells @xmath35 are convex polytopes and therefore simply connected .",
    "this can be easily seen from the characterization of this set as an intersection of halfspaces .",
    "indeed , @xmath39 is just a straight line .",
    "thus , both @xmath48 and @xmath49 are convex polytopes . as intersections of convex sets are convex sets",
    ", @xmath50 is still a convex polytope and we are done .",
    "however , this is the only case where we actually have connected sets . for all other cases of @xmath2 , the sets @xmath35 do not have to be connected !",

    "then , @xmath59 is in general not connected .",
    "as the measure @xmath5 is a convex combination of just two dirac - measures , we can safely work in @xmath60 .",
    "we will take @xmath61 and @xmath62 . in order to characterize the set @xmath59 one needs to study its boundary @xmath63 .",

    "the figures show the typical behaviour of @xmath67 for @xmath68 and for @xmath69 .",
    "they also show , why theorem [ euklid ] holds .",
    "+ in the case of @xmath68 ( figure 1 ) we can draw a straight line from a point in @xmath70 , that is on the left hand side of the level set , to a point in @xmath59 on the right hand side of the level set which intersects the level sets three times . completing this line to a convex polygon @xmath47 such that @xmath71 and @xmath72 are inside the polygon , we find a convex set @xmath47 such that @xmath59 is not connected . to show that this is indeed possible it suffices to show that the graph of the level set has a minimum in @xmath73 and a change in sign in its second derivative for some @xmath74 .",

    "the graph of the level set has a maximum at @xmath73 .",
