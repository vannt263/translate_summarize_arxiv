    "the development of nanodetectors and the strict requirements on their performance triggered intense experimental and theoretical studies of their thermal properties .",
    "these detectors work usually in a temperature range around 1  k or below and are supported by thin , insulating membranes .",
    "the thickness of such membranes is of the order of 100 nm , which , in the given temperature range , makes it comparable to the dominant thermal phonon wavelength . in problems where the phonon wavelength is comparable to or longer than some of the dimensions of the system in question , the three dimensional ( 3d ) phonon gas model can not be applied anymore to calculate the system s thermal properties .",
    "instead , one has to use the phonon modes specific to the system , which are the eigenmodes of the elastic equation for the given geometry .",
    "the membranes that support the detectors are made of amorphous , low stress silicon - nitride ( sin@xmath2 ) and their thermal properties have been measured in various geometries by different groups ( see for example refs .  [ ] ) .",
    "depending on the quality and the dimensions of the samples , and possibly the temperature range in which measurements were done , the heat flux along the membrane may be due to either diffusive @xcite or radiative phonon transport.@xcite in the case of diffusive phonon transport , it was observed that the heat conductivity @xmath0 is roughly proportional to @xmath3 .    for a better thermal insulation of the detector",
    ", the underlying membrane is sometimes cut .",
    "the result is a self - supporting structure with a wider area in the middle , connected to the bulk by long , narrow bridges , like in fig .",
    "[ membrane2]b.@xcite    the heat conductivity along such bridges has again a power law dependence on the temperature , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 takes values between 1.5 and 2.@xcite for the samples measured in [ ] , @xmath5 increased with the width of the bridge .",
    "the heat capacity of a membrane is more difficult to measure directly , since the membrane is always in contact with the bulk .",
    "however , it can be estimated by applying ac heating and measuring the amplitude of the temperature oscillations . in this way",
    "leivo and pekola @xcite observed that the ratio @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the heat capacity , increases with temperature for the narrowest bridges .",
    "as mentioned above , to explain theoretically all these observations we have to work with the proper set of phonon modes . for wide membranes with parallel surfaces , the eigenmodes of the elastic equations are called _ lamb modes _ and _ horizontal shear modes _ , as explained for example in ref .",
    "[ ] . using these modes and their dispersion relations , we could describe quite well the thermal properties of the membranes in the low temperature limit,@xcite i.e.  at temperatures where the the characteristic thermal wavelength of the phonons is much longer than the thickness of the membrane .",
    "nevertheless , the same temperature dependence of the heat conductivity and heat capacity persists also in a temperature range where this characteristic thermal wavelength becomes equal , or even smaller than the thickness .",
    "this can no longer be explained only by the dispersion relation of the lamb modes in the membrane and we have to take into account the amorphous structure of the membrane and the resulting phonon scattering .",
    "an amorphous material contains dynamic defects which can be modeled by an ensemble of two - level systems ( tls).@xcite a tls can be understood as an atom or group of atoms which can tunnel between two close minima in the configuration space .",
    "any deformation of the material disturbs the tls , which can have a transition ( an excitation or a de - excitation ) to the other energy level .",
    "a passing phonon produces such a deformation and therefore may be scattered by the tls . in bulk materials , the phonon modes are simple , transversally or longitudinally polarized plane waves and the deformation field they produce can be described by only two parameters , the wave vector ( or the wavelength ) and the polarization . as a consequence , in the so called _ standard tunneling model",
    "_ , the interaction hamiltonian has a very simple structure.@xcite in a mesoscopic system , the deformation caused by the _ displacement field _ of a phonon mode is more complex and the tls - phonon interaction hamiltonian has to be modified accordingly .",
    "this was done in ref .",
    "here we use this more general hamiltonian to calculate the interaction of the phonon modes of the membrane with the tlss .",
    "a tls is described by a hamiltonian which has the form @xmath8 when written in the basis formed by the ground states of the two potential wells between which the system tunnels @xcite . in eq .",

    "the hamiltonian ( [ eqn_tls_hamiltonian ] ) can be diagonalized by an orthogonal transformation @xmath13 , @xmath14 and we obtain the excitation energy , @xmath15 . everywhere in this paper",
    "the superscript @xmath16 denotes the _ transpose _ of a matrix .    the tls parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 are not the same for all the tlss in the material , but they are well modeled by the distribution @xmath17 in the unit volume of the material .",
    "we can rewrite the function @xmath18 in terms of the more practical variables @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 the tlss that have an excitation energy comparable to @xmath22 are very efficient phonon scatterers .",
    "the deformation due to the displacement field of a phonon is quantitatively described by the _ strain field _ , which will be represented here by the 6-component vector @xmath23.@xcite if we denote the displacement field by @xmath24 , then the strain is defined as the _ symmetric gradient _ of @xmath24 , i.e.  @xmath25 .",

    "now we calculate the heat conductivity in the limit of low temperature . in that limit ,",
    "only the lowest branch of each polarization will be occupied and we can write eq .",

    "the above expression leads to the temperature dependence @xmath1 and this dependence is a hallmark of the tls - limited heat conductance at low temperature .    for a numerical estimate",
    "let us use for the cut - off the finite size of the membrane , which limits the wave vectors to values of the order of @xmath207 .",

    "but since @xmath138 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eqn_taus0 ] ) and ( [ eqn_tau_a_01 ] ) ) , the contributions of all the phonon polarizations to the heat conductivity are of the same order .",
    "we used the model introduced in ref .  [ ] to calculate the scattering of the elastic modes in a thin , amorphous membrane .",
    "we modeled the scattering centers in the membrane by an ensemble of tlss with the same properties and distribution over energy splitting and asymmetry as the tlss in a bulk material . if this assumption is valid remains to be checked by experiment .",
    "we obtained the expressions for the tls relaxation time ( [ eqn_tau_epsilon ] ) , for the phonon scattering time ( [ eqn_tau_mu ] ) and for the heat conductivity @xmath0 ( [ eqn_kappa_t ] ) .    for general temperatures , the heat conductivity and the scattering times",
    "have to be calculated numerically .",
    "we calculated analytical low temperature approximations and compared the mean free paths of different phonon polarizations . in this way we observed that the contribution of the lowest branches of the phonon modes to the heat conductivity are logarithmically divergent at @xmath215 .",
    "this could be a reason for which in some experiments a radiative heat transport is observed.@xcite nevertheless , there is a natural lower cut - off of @xmath215 due to the finite size of the membrane .",
    "this cut - off renders @xmath0 finite , which , in the low temperature limit behaves like @xmath1 .",
    "this behavior is a hallmark of the tls - limited heat conductance at low temperature .    due to the dispersion relations of the phonon modes ,",
    "the tlss distribution in the low energy limit has a bigger impact on the heat conductivity in thin membranes than in bulk materials .",
    "if we for instance modify the distribution ( [ eqn_tls_density ] ) into @xmath216 with an extra energy dependence , @xmath217 , we make the expression ( [ eqn_conductivity_low_t ] ) for @xmath0 convergent even in the @xmath218 limit , which leads to a low temperature asymptotic dependence of @xmath219 .",
