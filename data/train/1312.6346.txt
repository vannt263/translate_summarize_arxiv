    "furthermore such a frster resonance allows to easily tune the interaction strength @xcite .",
    "+ the most obvious problem in using rydberg excitation in quantum gases is the mismatch in timescales ; the lifetime of rydberg atoms in low l states is on the order of tens of microseconds whereas it typically takes three orders of magnitude longer for a typical experimental system to equilibrate .",
    "this problem can be overcome by only weakly dressing @xcite the atomic ground state with a small fraction @xmath0 of the rydberg state enhancing the overall lifetime of the system by @xmath1 .",
    "rydberg dressing has been proposed to realize a number of interesting phases in ultracold gases , such as rotons , solitons or supersolids @xcite .",
    "+ the strong interaction between rydberg atoms can result in collective effects in the excitation process , namely the suppression of further excitation in a volume around the first rydberg atom , the so - called rydberg - blockade effect @xcite .",

    "we provide evidence for this by showing experimental data that also demonstrates further practical problems arising .",
    "we discuss the limits of rydberg dressing in current experiments and point out possible solutions for future approaches .",
    "following the argumentation of @xcite , we begin with the simple case of two atoms , dressed with a rydberg state by a coupling field with rabi frequency @xmath2 and laser detuning @xmath3 . for simplicity",
    "we assume the interaction @xmath4 between atoms in the particular rydberg state to be of purely repulsive van - der - waals type .",
    "in fact it turns out , that the actual shape of the rydberg interaction plays a minor role , effectively reduced to the sign of the potential and the value of the blockade radius @xmath5 ; one can account for attractive interaction by simply changing the sign of the detuning .",

    "the potential converges to the rydberg - rydberg interaction potential @xmath4 , weighted with the rydberg fraction @xmath0 squared ( dashed line , corrected for offset @xmath18 ) .",

    "the blockade radius @xmath5 is defined as the interatomic distance , where the power broadening @xmath19 ( for weak dressing @xmath20 ) equates the absolute value of the rydberg - rydberg interaction @xmath21 . for a repulsive van - der - waals interaction @xmath22 , as it is present for most rydberg states far from possible resonances , one obtains : @xmath23 in the case of red detuning and repulsive potentials , the potential ( up to an offset ) is given as the rydberg interaction potential , weighted with the probability to find both atoms in the rydberg state , which is at large distances @xmath13 approximately @xmath24 . at @xmath5 the detuning of the doubly excited state increases due to the rydberg - rydberg interaction , tuning this state out of resonance .",
    "this is the well known phenomenon of rydberg blockade @xcite .",
    "therefore the probability to find both atoms in the rydberg state decreases dramatically and the potential saturates at a constant value . for blue detuning the interaction energy saturates on the same asymptotic values , but with the values for small and large interatomic distances @xmath13 interchanged .",
    "it is important to note that the difference between the asymptotic values of the potential energy and therefore also the overall magnitude of the dressing effect is determined only by the laser parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite .",

    "@xcite : @xmath25 the overall energy scale is given by the difference of equations ( [ eq : u2atomfree ] ) and ( [ eq : u2superatom ] ) , which can be approximated as @xmath26 for large detunings @xmath27 .",
    "the actual shape and strength of the rydberg interaction determines mainly the value @xmath5 of the blockade radius and therefore the transition between the two regimes . for attractive rydberg interaction potentials",

    "+ the two - atom result has a very simple explanation : if the two atoms are separated by a distance much larger than the blockade radius @xmath5 , the system can be described as two independent atoms in a laser field with rabi frequency @xmath2 and detuning @xmath3 with respect to the transition to the rydberg level .",
    "therefore both atoms individually exhibit an ac stark shift @xmath29 .",
    "if the two atoms approach each other , at the distance of the blockade radius @xmath5 ( equation  [ rbc6 ] ) the rydberg - rydberg interaction potential becomes so strong that the state with both atoms excited is tuned out of resonance .",
    "the explanation of the behaviour of the system in the blockaded regime becomes obvious from the following discussion of the @xmath30-atomic case .",
    "+ we study now the density dependent energy of a system consisting of @xmath30 rydberg dressed atoms . at very low densities the interatomic distances @xmath13 are much larger than the blockade radius @xmath5 .",
    "the atoms are therefore independent and the energy of the system is @xmath30 times the light shift @xmath29 of one single atom in equation ( [ eq : u2atomfree ] ) : @xmath31 in the high density limit all atoms are situated within one blockade sphere of volume @xmath32 . in this case , the dimensionality of the hilbert space can be dramatically reduced by the fact that all states with more than one rydberg excitation are completely tuned out of resonance due to the rydberg blockade .",

    "this state , a so called super atom @xcite , is coupled by the light field to the ground state with a collectively enhanced rabi frequency @xmath42 .",
    "the collective rabi frequency then also has to be used in the calculation of the ac stark effect .",
    "the energy of the fully blockaded n - atomic system ( equation  [ eq : unsuperatom ] ) is therefore the light shift of a single super atom with a collective rabi frequency @xmath42 and detuning @xmath3 . in the special case @xmath43",
    "the result of equation  ( [ eq : u2superatom ] ) is recovered .",
    "the interaction potential induced by rydberg dressing shown in figure  [ fig:2atompot]a can therefore be viewed as the gradual transition between a collective light shift of one super atom and the individual light shift of two independent atoms in the vicinity of the blockade radius @xmath5 .",
    "+ to study the consequences of high densities for the effect of rydberg dressing , we calculate now the additional interaction energy @xmath44 per atom .",

    "this is the ac stark shift of a single free rydberg dressed atom , as the contribution of the dressed super atom to the energy of a single atom becomes negligible . +",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : eeff ] the energy functional @xmath65 deviates from the initial linear slope already at densities well below @xmath68 .",
    "the simple explanation is that collective effects already start to play a role as soon as there are more than two atoms within one blockade volume , which is the case at densities above @xmath69 as a consequence , collective effects beyond two - body interaction have to be considered also at relatively low densities , where they already start to reduce any influence of rydberg dressing .",
    "we now apply our results to calculate the modification of the wavefunction of a bose - einstein condensate under rydberg - dressing .",
    "our model provides an analytic expression of the steady state density distribution of a bec dressed with a homogeneous coupling field @xmath2 even in case of a cylindrically symmetric harmonic trapping potential .",

    "the interaction energy is linear in the density @xmath73 and can therefore be described with an effective s - wave scattering length @xmath74 ( see equation  [ gdress ] ) . for high densities , the energy functional @xmath57 becomes constant and thus only contributes as a constant offset to the chemical potential @xmath75 . in this case no effect of rydberg dressing on the density distribution can be expected .",
    "+ the ground state stationary solution @xmath76 of equation  [ eq : gpet ] can be obtained numerically e.g. using the split step fourier method @xcite . for condensates with large atom numbers",

    "furthermore the full numerical solution and the result of thomas - fermi approximation agree very well in the centre of the condensate , whereas the deviation at the outer parts becomes significant .",
    "it turns out that in these regions the kinetic energy term is dominating the density distribution so that here the effect of rydberg dressing is even less visible than in the centre of the bec .",
    "this is in contrast to what one could have expected from the scaling of the energy functional @xmath57 with density alone ( see figure  [ fig : eeff ] ) .",

    "+ from figure  [ fig : eeff ] one can conclude that at high atomic densities the effect of rydberg dressing is vanishing .",
    "the rydberg blockade here limits the achievable interaction strength . in a not fully blockaded sample , at densities below @xmath47 ,",
    "a higher density increases the collective rabi frequency @xmath42 leading to more rydberg excitation in the system . above @xmath47 , however , no further rydberg excitation is possible . the total interaction energy , determined by the number of rydberg excitations in the system ,",
    "is then saturated on a constant value that is shared among more atoms .",
    "the contribution for each individual atom is thus effectively vanishing at high densities .",
    "at very low densities , however , the interatomic distance increases thereby also reducing the interaction strength . the maximum effect is therefore expected in the intermediate regime where the energy difference per atom between the blockaded system and the non blockaded system is the highest .",

    "we choose the red laser power such that the total atom loss over the length of the laser pulse is largely negligible . for experiments lasting @xmath121 we can apply effective rabi frequencies on the order of few khz .",
    "this sequence length corresponds to about twice the inverse axial trap frequency and was chosen to allow for the bec density distribution to reach its equilibrium .",
    "we switch off the rydberg lasers and the trap simultaneously . after a time of flight lasting @xmath122 , an absorption image is taken . from these images",

    "obviously the decay from the rydberg state , visible as a loss feature in figure  [ fig : dressingall]c , is the limiting factor ; the decay leads to strong heating that destroys nearly the whole condensate at small detunings @xmath137 .",
    "outside this regime the expected effect of rydberg dressing according to figure  [ fig : depomegadelta ] is very small .",
    "consequently we are not able to detect any significant deformation of the condensate within the experimental error ( see figure  [ fig : dressingall]e ) . furthermore , from the measurement on the 35s state another problem becomes obvious . in the reference spectrum taken in a thermal sample at @xmath138",
    ", there is a small additional line red detuned by about @xmath139 to the atomic line ( see figure  [ fig : dressingall]a ) .",
    "this line can be assigned to a molecular bound state of a rydberg atom and a ground state atom , so called ultralong - range rydberg molecules @xcite . in the bec , this leads to loss features that are more pronounced for two reasons .",
    "first , the scaling of the franck - condon factor for the photoassociation of molecules with the density of ground state atoms increases the excitation probability in a bec . and second , these bound states show a reduced lifetime at higher densities @xcite thereby causing stronger atom losses .",
    "+ the 44d@xmath127 state was studied at two different frster defects to the resonance with the 46p@xmath140 and 42f@xmath141 pair state @xcite .",
    "since the sign of the frster defect is inverted , we would expect here a dressing effect of opposite sign ( see part  [ dipolar ] ) .",
    "these experiments were preformed with condensates at a four times higher atom number and therefore next to twice the peak density compared to the ones on the s - states",
    ". the better stability of the experiment at these parameters leads to a lower noise level ; however , the expected effect of rydberg dressing is even further decreased because of the higher atomic density and therefore again below the experimental noise level .",
    "in particular , we observe no significant difference between the two measurements at different frster defects . instead ,",
    "for the rydberg d - states , we observe a band of molecular states @xcite in the spectrum ( see figure  [ fig : dressingall]b ) . in the same range of detunings",
    ", there is a strong and several mhz broad loss feature in the measurements with the bec , as can be seen from figure  [ fig : dressingall]d .",
    "furthermore this loss seems to be connected to a change in aspect ratio ( figure  [ fig : dressingall]f ) .",
    "this does not necessarily imply an asymmetric deformation of the condensate .",
    "calculations within thomas - fermi approximation @xcite indicate that even an isotropic deformation of the bec in the trap can lead to a change in aspect ratio at finite time of flight .",
    "however , it also seems unlikely that this deformation is caused by uniform losses alone , since it does not fully coincide with the observed bec atom losses . especially there is no such pronounced effect observed in the measurements of the rydberg s - states ( see figure  [ fig : dressingall]e ) although there are equally strong atom losses present close to resonance .",
    "+ in any case ultralong - range rydberg molecules can possibly inhibit the observation of rydberg dressing at red detuning for several rydberg states .",
    "this effect becomes even more important at rydberg states with higher principal quantum number @xmath142 . as the binding energy is decreasing proportional to @xmath143 ,",
    "the molecular states come closer to the atomic rydberg state .",
    "then polyatomic bound states @xcite start to play a role , eventually leading to a density dependent shift of the rydberg line @xcite .",
    "several technical constraints are likely to impede an experimental observation of rydberg dressing in our current setup .",
    "one is the unfavourable scaling of the effect with the density of ground state atoms .",
    "a low temperature sample is required to observe the small effects expected .",
    "such samples , like bose - einstein condensates typically feature a high atomic density .",
    "as discussed before , the impact of rydberg dressing is greatly reduced in strongly blockaded samples .",
    "elements with larger background s - wave scattering length , such as cesium , allow the preparation of condensates at lower peak density @xcite . in this case , the modification of the density distribution , however , would be even smaller due to the large mean - field interaction between the atoms .",
    "furthermore , ultracold samples of cesium can only be prepared in optical dipole traps .",
    "common red detuned dipole traps create differential light shifts between the ground and rydberg state that can lead to an inhomogeneous laser detuning @xmath3 to the rydberg state .",
    "therefore , a magic wavelength trap @xcite would be required . instead of reducing the atomic density",
    "one possibility would be to reduce the blockade radius @xmath5 of the sample in order to tune the system just to the onset of saturation .",
    "to this end either a rydberg state at low principal quantum number can be chosen since the @xmath88-coefficient is scaling as @xmath144 @xcite .",
    "alternatively also the excitation linewidth @xmath145 could in principle be increased artificially .",
    "the drawback of the first possibility is that the lifetime of the rydberg state at the same time decreases @xmath146 , thereby reducing the tolerable rydberg fraction .",
    "the latter is not practicable due to the unfavourable scaling @xmath147 and the fact that large excitation linewidths preclude realization of small laser detunings @xmath3 .",
    "another possibility would involve a frster resonance to tune the rydberg interaction strength as discussed in part  [ dipolar ] . +",
    "another principal problem is the long timescale required for experiments studying mechanical effects .",
    "the maximum achievable rydberg fraction @xmath90 is limited by the product of pulse length and the decay rate from the dressed state .",
    "this can be simply estimated for the experimental parameters from part  [ experiment ] , in particular the 32s rydberg state and a pulse length of @xmath148 .",
    "if we restrict the atom losses to an arbitrary value of @xmath149 , we obtain the condition @xmath150 using the decay rate @xmath151 of the 32s rydberg state including blackbody radiation at @xmath152 @xcite . at a detuning of @xmath59 , corresponding to the optimal detuning for the current density ( see part  [ experiment ] )",
    "therefore the rabi frequency is limited to @xmath153 .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ fig : depomegadelta ] the expected density change due to rydberg dressing at these parameters is on the order of only a percent .",
    "+     dependency of rydberg dressing of a bec on the initial peak density @xmath87 and an offset density @xmath154 .",
    "the relative change of peak density @xmath92 in steady state is calculated for a condensate consisting of @xmath93 atoms in a cylindrically symmetric trap with trap frequencies @xmath94 and @xmath95 . the condensate is dressed detuned by @xmath59 with rabi frequency @xmath58 to a repulsive rydberg state with @xmath96 , corresponding to the 32s rydberg state . ,",
    "scaledwidth=60.0% ]    a rather technical problem finally is related to the preparation of the condensate .",
    "a very pure bec is required since any non condensed atoms take part in the collective light shift but do not lead to a deformation of the condensate .",
    "we can account for a residual thermal cloud by simply introducing an offset density @xmath154 in our calculations .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ fig : deprhorhooffs ] the reduction of the effect of rydberg dressing onto the condensate is sizeable even at small offset densities @xmath154 since the main effect according to figure  [ fig : eeff ] is expected at low densities . + even though at present it seems unlikely to observe rydberg dressing at the parameters discussed above , we see two main paths towards a possible experimental realization .",
    "one would involve samples at reduced dimensionality as optical lattices @xcite thereby reducing the effective density .",
    "adhering to three - dimensional samples instead would require a significant increase in rabi frequency .",
    "the effect of rydberg dressing scales roughly as @xmath155 ( equations  [ gdress ] and [ eq : edresslim ] ) while the decay rate of the dressed state is only scaling as the rydberg fraction @xmath156 . by increasing the laser detuning @xmath3 by the same amount as the rabi frequency @xmath2",
    "one can therefore expect a stronger impact at the same loss rate .",
    "for the parameters discussed above , a modification of the peak density on the order of ten percent would therefore require a more than hundred times larger laser power .",
    "in summary , we have presented a simple model of a rydberg dressed system .",
    "this model provides an easy qualitative and quantitative description of the collective effects arising .",
    "we studied the impact of rydberg dressing onto a three - dimensional axially symmetric bose - einstein condensate , a situation that is experimentally relevant , depending on different parameters .",
    "our model allows to intuitively understand the dependency of the maximum effect on various experimental parameters .",
    "the limit of thomas - fermi approximation in the case of rydberg dressing was identified by a comparison with a full numerical solution of the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "we proposed the extension to rydberg states close to a frster resonance . here further work is required in order to understand possible collective effects arising in the frster coupling .",
    "finally we described our current experimental situation in view of a possible realization of rydberg dressing .",
    "principle as well as practical challenges were demonstrated and , as a conclusion , possible solutions were discussed .",
