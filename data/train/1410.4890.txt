    "two parallel quantum waveguides , separated by an electrostatic potential barrier and coupled via a coupling region or a window to facilitate an interference between the waveguides , may be one of the candidates to construct a qubit  @xcite .",
    "the characteristics of the transport of electrons through the double waveguide system determines possible quantum logic operations  @xcite .",

    "several proposals have been suggested to control the electron motion in a waveguide system that provides the qubit operation such as : magnetic switching , an external magnetic field can be used to transfer an electron wave between two asymmetric waveguides  @xcite , electrostatic potential switching , the coupling window can be defined by a saddle potential that washes out fluctuation resonance peaks and increases the speed of electron switching processes between the waveguides  @xcite , a single quantum dot close to the coupling window has been considered to enhance electron inter - waveguide transport in a coulomb blockade regime  @xcite , and electron switching by using acoustic waves  @xcite .",
    "there are still non - trivial aspects that need to be investigated concerning the control of electron switching in a dqw system for implementing an action of a quantum logic gate . in this work ,",

    "we observe oscillations in the charge current by varying the length of the coupling window ( cw ) .",
    "the oscillations are caused by inter - waveguide transport due to interference of states between the guides . in the presence of the photon cavity ,",
    "the current oscillations are affected by the photon polarization , the number of photons , and the photon frequency as these cavity parameters influence the interference between the states in the waveguide system .",
