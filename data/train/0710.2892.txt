    "we note that ux tau a is in a multiple system @xcite , with the closest component at 2.\"6 @xmath0 360 pc in projection ; thus , the outer disk may have a smaller r@xmath23 than assumed here , which may decrease the disk mass but not the derived wall properties a@xmath20 , t@xmath11 , and z@xmath11 which are constrained by the best fit to the mid - infrared . in modeling the outer disk , we hold @xmath6 fixed and vary @xmath7 ; this is equivalent to finding the best - fit disk mass since m@xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath6/@xmath7 .    when compared to the median sed of taurus ( * ? ?",

    "1 ) which has been shown to be representative of an optically thick continuous disk @xcite , ux tau a s relatively strong mid - infrared deficit makes it apparent that its disk is not continuous i.e. it is not a  full disk \" .",
    "however , in contrast with the other transitional disks found around tts , the near - infrared portion of ux tau a s sed agrees with the median sed of tts in taurus ; this indicates that optically thick material remains in the innermost part of the disk in contrast to all other transitional disks modeled so far . since the inner disk is optically thick",
    ", it must have a sharp gas - dust transition at the dust destruction radius as  full disks \" in ctts @xcite . in figure 1",
    "we show the contribution from the wall of an optically thick inner disk located at the dust destruction radius at 0.16 au , assuming t@xmath11=1400 k. the best fit is obtained with large grains , in agreement with the lack of a 10 silicate feature .",
    "the flux deficit in the sed around 10 puts an upper limit to the extent of the inner optically thick disk to @xmath240.18 au .",
    "our analysis of a model fit to lkca 15 shows an optically thick disk truncated at @xmath046 au , as delineated by millimeter interferometric imaging @xcite .",
    "the outer optically thick disk contributes to most of the flux in the millimeter and the wall of the outer disk contributes much of the flux in the mid- and far - infrared ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the near - infrared portion of the sed of lkca 15 lies below the median sed of taurus , so the case for an optically thick inner disk is not as clear cut as in ux tau a. however , the near - ir excess above the photosphere in lk ca 15 is substantially higher than is seen in gm aur @xcite , tw hya @xcite , or cs cha @xcite , where the optically thin inner disk contains a small amount of dust .",
    "our analysis suggests that an optically thick inner disk wall at the dust destruction radius ( 0.12 au ) can account for the significant near - infrared excess in lk ca 15 ( fig .",
    "2 , top ) , and that the optically thick component can not extend beyond 0.15 au .",
    "we also require 4@xmath1610@xmath36 @xmath39 of optically thin dust between 0.15 and 5 au to produce the 10 silicate feature . this optically thin dust mixture is composed of 85@xmath4 amorphous silicates , 6.8@xmath4 organics , 1.3@xmath4 troilite , 6.8@xmath4 amorphous carbon , and less than 1@xmath4 enstatite and forsterite .",
    "the total emission of this optically thin region is scaled to the vertical optical depth at 10 , @xmath40 @xmath0 0.012 .",
    "we follow @xcite in calculating the optically thin dust region and note that the dust composition and @xmath40 are free parameters constrained by the best fit to the sed",
    ".    in the bottom panel of figure 2 we present an alternative structure for lkca 15 s inner disk .",
    "it is possible to fit lkca 15 s sed with only optically thin dust within the inner hole . in this model ,",
    "the near - infrared excess and 10 emission would originate in 5@xmath1610@xmath36 m@xmath13 of optically thin dust located between 0.12 to 4 au .",
    "this optically thin dust mixture would be composed of 61@xmath4 amorphous silicates , 7@xmath4 organics , 1@xmath4 troilite , 30@xmath4 amorphous carbon , and less than 1@xmath4 enstatite and forsterite .",
    "the total emission of this optically thin region is scaled to the vertical optical depth at 10 , @xmath41 .",
    "this model ( bottom inset , fig .",
    "2 ) does not fit the slope of the near - side of the irs spectrum ( @xmath247 ) or the irac data as well as the previously discussed model ( top inset , fig .",
    "the optical depth in the near - infrared is @xmath00.01 , about 5 times greater than that of the previous model , mainly due to the difference in the amorphous carbon fraction .",
    "while an optically thin region is necessary in both scenarios , we can exclude a model where the optically thin region extends further than @xmath0 5 au since the contribution at 20 then becomes too strong .",
    "here we introduce the  pre - transitional disk \" class where we see the incipient development of disk gaps in optically thick protoplanetary disks as evidenced by significant near - infrared excesses when compared to the taurus median sed and previously studied transitional disks @xcite .",
    "the pre - transitional disk of ux tau a has a @xmath056 au gap as opposed to an inner hole .",
    "it is also possible to fit lkca 15 s sed with a @xmath046 au gap that contains some optically thin dust ; a model that has a hole rather than a gap also fits its sed and future near - infrared interferometry may be able to discriminate between these models .",
    "however , the truncation of lkca 15 s outer disk at @xmath046 au is consistent with resolved millimeter interferometric observations @xcite which makes it one of three inner disk holes imaged in the millimeter ( tw hya : hughes et al .",
    "2007 ; gm aur : wilner et al . in preparation ) .",
    "in addition to our sample , the disks around f - g stars studied by @xcite also belong to the pre - transitional disk category .",
    "the large gaps that are being detected in pre - transitional disks are most likely due to observational bias since larger gaps will create larger mid - infrared deficits in the sed .",
    "smaller gaps will most likely have less apparent dips in their seds and be more difficult to identify , however , if their gaps contain some optically thin material the silicate emission in these objects should be much stronger than can be explained by a full disk model",
    ".    the existence of an inner optically thick disk may be an indicator of the first stages of disk clearing that will eventually lead to the the inner holes that have been seen in previously reported transitional disks ; this has important implications on disk evolution theories since only planet - formation can account for this structure .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations have shown that a newly formed planet could accrete and sweep out the material around it through tidal disturbances and this is sufficient in producing the hole size in coku tau@xmath24 @xcite , even maintaining substantial accretion rates @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite have found that the intrinsic properties of transitional disks may favor planet formation .",
    "another proposed formation mechanism for the holes in transitional disks is photoevaporation , in which a photoevaporative wind halts mass accretion towards the inner disk and material in this inner disk is rapidly evacuated creating an inner hole @xcite ; the hole then increases in size as the edge continues photoevaporating @xcite .",
    "neither this model nor the inside - out evacuation induced by the mri @xcite would explain how an optically thick disk accreting at a sizable accretion rate ( see table 1 ) would remain inside the hole . rapid dust growth and settling has also been proposed to explain the holes in disks @xcite .",
    "again , this does not account for the presence of optically thick inner disk material given that theory suggests grain growth should be fastest in the inner disk , not at some intermediate radius @xcite .",
    "our sample also has interesting dust compositions ( watson et al .",
    "2007 , sargent et al . in preparation ) .",
    "lkca 15 has an amorphous silicate feature indicating little if any processing leading to the crystallization seen in other young stars .",
    "amorphous silicates are also seen in coku tau@xmath42 , dm tau , and gm aur .",
    "in contrast , ux tau a is different from all the other transitional disks because it has crystalline silicate emission features in addition to amorphous silicate emission features ( fig . 1 inset ) .",
    "the wall at @xmath056 au is the main contributor to the crystalline silicate emission since it dominates the flux in the mid- and far - infrared .",
    "this raises the question of whether crystalline silicates are created close to the star or if they can be created in situ at @xmath056 au .",
    "if the former , it challenges current radial - mixing theories , none of which can get significant amounts of crystalline silicates out to this distance @xcite .",
    "one possibility for _ in situ _ processing may be collisions of larger bodies , which might produce small grains heated sufficiently to create crystals ( s. kenyon , personal communication ) .",
    "pre - transitional disks offer further insight into the diversity of the  transitional disk \" class and future studies of these disks will greatly advance our understanding of disk evolution and planet formation ."
