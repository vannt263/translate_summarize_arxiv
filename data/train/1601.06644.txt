    "the wetting flows ( where the triple solid - liquid - fluid contact line is present ) are important for many practical applications ranging from the metal coating to the medical treatment of the lung airways .",
    "the contact line statics and dynamics attracted a lot of attention from the scientific community during the last decades .",
    "it became clear that the hydrodynamics in the region of the liquid wedge close to the contact line ( which we will call clr - contact line region ) differs from the hydrodynamics in the bulk of the liquid .",
    "because of the contact line singularity @xcite , the fluid motion in presence of the contact line appears to be much slower than without it .",
    "this difference can be accounted for by the introduction of the anomalously large energy dissipation inside the clr @xcite .    for practical purposes",
    ", one needs to know the dynamics of the liquid surface influenced by this dissipation .",
    "this influence is especially strong in the very common case of ( i ) low viscosity fluids that ( ii ) wet partially the solid with ( iii ) no precursor film on it . in this case",
    "the bulk dissipation is particularly small with respect to the large clr dissipation @xcite .",
    "the contact line motion is very slow and the liquid surface can be described in the quasi - static approximation @xcite .",
    "the dissipation in the liquid ( energy per unit time ) can then be approximated by the dissipation in the clr as @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the normal component of the contact line velocity and the integration is performed along the contact line .",
    "the generalized dissipation coefficient @xmath2 is a constant that is assumed to be much larger that the liquid shear viscosity .",
    "the expression ( [ diss ] ) assumes that the contribution of a piece of the clr to the dissipation is proportional to the contact line length .",
    "then the @xmath3 term is leading for small @xmath1 .",
    "the dissipation coefficient @xmath2 can be obtained e.g. from measurements of the kinetics of relaxation of an oval sessile drop toward its equilibrium shape ( see @xcite , where it was found @xmath4 times larger than the shear viscosity ) .",
    "it can also be obtained from the measurements of @xmath1 and the dynamic contact angle @xmath5 by using the expression @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the equilibrium value of the contact angle and @xmath8 is the surface tension .",
    "[ cos ] is common for many contact line motion models .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that eq .",
    "[ cos ] follows from the expression ( [ diss ] ) for the cases where @xmath1 does not vary along the contact line ( i.e. for the contact line of constant curvature ) .    usually",
    ", one is interested to know the displacement of the contact line ( or its statistical properties in the case of the irregular solid ) because its position serves as a boundary condition for the determination of the shape of the liquid surface .",
    "the recent articles on this subject show that no general approach to this problem is accepted .",
    "it is recognized generally @xcite that the static contact line equation should be non - local because the contact line displacement at one point influences its position at other points through the surface tension . in dynamics , the local relations similar to eq .",
    "[ cos ] were considered universal for a long time . in our previous work",
    "@xcite we developed a non - local dynamic approach .",
    "we showed that if non - locality is taken into account , eq .  [ cos ] is not valid in the general case where @xmath1 varies along the contact line .",
    "this variation can be due either to the initially inhomogeneous contact line curvature ( like in @xcite ) or to a inhomogeneous substrate . in this letter",
    "we analyze this latter case .",
    "we use this non - local approach to derive an equation of motion for the very common case of the capillary rise of the liquid along a vertical solid wall with the account of the surface defects .",
    "a cartesian reference system @xmath9 is chosen in such a way that the liquid surface far from the wall ( defined by the @xmath10 plane ) coincides with the @xmath11 plane , see fig .",

    "is considered so that the final form for the equation of motion is found in the limit @xmath17 .",

    "the defects are accounted for in the second term @xcite @xmath25 by the fluctuations of the function @xmath26 which is the difference of the surface energies ( in @xmath8 units ) of the gas - solid and liquid - solid interfaces at the point @xmath27 of the solid surface .",

    "( [ hh ] ) provides us with an unique solution because the system  knows \" the direction of the contact line motion and its history .",
