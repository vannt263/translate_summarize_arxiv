    "constraining the physical properties of the dense molecular gas phase is important for understanding the relation between the gas properties and the star formation process in nearby and high-@xmath5 galaxies .",
    "hco@xmath2 has successfully been used as a tracer of dense gas ( @xmath6@xmath7 ) both in star forming regions of the milky way ( e.g. , @xcite ) and in nearby galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , it has also been detected at high redshifts towards the cloverleaf quasar @xcite and towards apm08279 + 5255 @xcite .",
    "hcn is another good tracer of dense gas and has also been observed both locally ( e.g. , @xcite ) and towards high redshift sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found that the hcn luminosity is correlated with the far - infrared luminosity for starforming galaxies over several decades .",
    "@xcite found that this correlation holds all the way to the smaller scales of the local star forming regions , i.e.  over 78 orders of magnitude .",
    "the number of nearby galaxies in which molecular gas observations allow resolving the emission across the dense gas starburst regions is limited to only a few . at a distance of only about 3.5 mpc @xcite , ngc253 , a member of the sculptor group of galaxies , is one of the closest starbursting galaxies .",
    "this makes it one of the best - suited laboratories for studies of a circumnuclear starburst and its effect on the ambient interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "some early detections of hcn and hco@xmath2 towards the center of ngc253 came from @xcite and @xcite , both using single - dish telescopes .",
    "@xcite presented first interferometry maps of hcn towards ngc253 using the nobeyama millimeter array .",
    "we here present owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) interferometry maps and atacama pathfinder experiment ( apex ) single - dish mapping of both hcn and hco@xmath2 , which we use for studying the spatial distribution and excitation of the two molecules in the circumnuclear starburst of ngc253 . the paper is structured as follows : section  2 presents the observations and data reduction , the results are given in  3 , and in  4 we discuss the implications both in the context of other nearby galaxies and for high redshift sources . at a distance of 3.5 mpc ,",
    "@xmath8 on the sky corresponds to 17.0 pc .",
    "we observed ngc253 in the hcn(1@xmath10 ) ( @xmath9 = 88.63185ghz ) , hco@xmath2(1@xmath10 ) ( @xmath9 = 89.18852ghz ) and co(1@xmath10 ) ( @xmath9 = 115.2712ghz ) transitions with the ovro millimeter - wavelength array in its c and e configurations .",
    "the hcn and hco@xmath2 observations were obtained simultaneously during four tracks taken between 1999 november and 2000 february ( 60 channels , with a channel width of 4mhz , corresponding to @xmath1013.5kms@xmath11 ) ; the co observations were taken during six tracks from 2001 october to 2002 march ( 120 channels with a width of 2mhz @xmath105.2kms@xmath11 ) ; the duration of one track was typically 5  hr .",
    "the observations for each array were edited and calibrated separately with the mma and the miriad packages .",
    "the _ uv_data were inspected and bad data points due to either poor atmospheric conditions or shadowing were removed , after which the data were calibrated .",
    "flux calibration was determined by observing neptune during most observing runs . for observing runs without planet observations",
    "the flux calibration has been bootstrapped using the gain calibrator 3c454.3 ( @xmath109  jy ) .",
    "these calibrators and an additional noise source were used to derive the complex bandpass corrections .",
    "the nearby calibrators b0135 - 247 ( @xmath100.37  jy ) , b0048 - 097 ( @xmath100.72  jy ) , and b0003 - 066 ( @xmath101.25  jy ) were used as secondary amplitude and phase calibrators .",
    "we estimate our flux calibration to be accurate to within 15% .    for each transition",
    ", we produced a data cube using `` robust '' weighting which was cleaned down to a level of twice the rms noise .",
    "this resulted in beam sizes ( and position angles ) of 3.79@xmath122.56@xmath13 ( 13@xmath147 ) and 3.84@xmath122.64@xmath13 ( 8@xmath149 ) for the hcn and the hco@xmath2 observations , respectively .",
    "as one of the main aims of this study is to compare the properties of the hcn and the hco@xmath2 emission , we convolved both cubes to a common resolution of 3.9@xmath122.7@xmath13 ( 10@xmath140 ) , which resulted in an rms noise of @xmath15mjybeam@xmath11 in one 4mhz channel .",
    "the resulting beam size for the co(1@xmath10 ) observations is 4.9@xmath122.7@xmath13 ( @xmath169 ) with an rms of @xmath17mjybeam@xmath11 per 2mhz channel .",
    "the channels not containing hcn and hco@xmath2 line emission were combined to create a continuum map at 3 mm ; the resulting rms in this image is 5mjybeam@xmath11 .",
    "we note that the resolution of the co and hcn maps is comparable to that of the interferometric maps from @xcite , while the hco@xmath2 has a higher resolution than the hat creek array map from @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the resolution of our 3 mm continuum map is a bit better than those of @xcite and @xcite .    as the channel width of the co(1@xmath10 )",
    "observations is different from the hcn(1@xmath10 ) and hco@xmath2(1@xmath10 ) observations , we regridded the co(1@xmath10 ) data cube to match the channel width of the other transitions .",
    "subsequently , we used the high signal  to  noise ratio co(1@xmath10 ) data cube to define , in each channel map , the regions that contain emission ( this is called the `` master '' cube ) .",
    "we used this master cube to blank both the hcn and hco@xmath2 cubes .",
    "all integrated maps shown here are based on these blanked cubes and contain the same areas of emission for all three transitions .",
    "we also obtained observations of the hcn(4@xmath13 ) ( @xmath9 = 354.50547ghz ) and hco@xmath2(4@xmath13 ) ( @xmath9 = 356.73413ghz ) transition using the apex 12 m telescope on chajnantor .",
    "for these frequencies the half ",
    "power beamwidth of the antenna is @xmath18 .",
    "the observations were carried out during two runs in 2006 september in good weather conditions ( typical water columns : 0.71 mm ) using the dual  side  band receiver apex-2a .",
    "calibration was achieved using the standard hot  cold  sky observing scheme roughly every 10minutes . for both runs typical system temperatures were @xmath19k ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "spectra were recorded using the fast fourier transform spectrometer on apex @xcite providing a bandwidth of 1ghz with an effective resolution of 120khz ( 0.12kms@xmath11 ) .",
    "the telescope pointing was checked on the nearby carbon star rscl and found to be accurate to @xmath21 .",
    "the observations were performed in the standard raster - mapping mode covering the full region where emission has been detected in the ovro maps in both transitions .",
    "data processing was done using the class software package . in the data processing , we dropped all scans with distorted baselines , subtracted linear baselines from the remaining spectra , and then rebinned to a velocity resolution of 20kms@xmath11 .",
    "finally , temperatures were converted to @xmath22 using a forward efficiency and a main beam efficiency of 0.97 and 0.73 respectively @xcite .",
    "the conversion from @xmath23 to flux is 32jyk@xmath11 at 350ghz .",
    "we estimate our flux calibration to be accurate to within 15% .",
    "figure  [ fig : chanmaps ] shows the ovro channel maps for the hcn(1@xmath10 ) and hco@xmath2(1@xmath10 ) data .",
    "it is striking that their spatial distributions are essentially identical .",
    "both molecules are tracing dense molecular gas in the circumnuclear starburst region of ngc253 .",
    "figure  [ fig : int_maps ] shows the integrated maps of hcn(1@xmath10 ) and hco@xmath2(1@xmath10 ) line emission , respectively .",
    "the slightly different morphology towards the southwest in the hco@xmath2(1@xmath10 ) map compared to hcn(1@xmath10 ) is likely due to the slightly lower signal  to  noise ratio in the map .",
    "the hcn(4@xmath13 ) and hco@xmath2(4@xmath13 ) spectra from apex are shown in figure  [ fig : apexspectra ] .",
    "the line profiles are very similar at all observed positions , and the rotation of the circumnuclear gas is nicely visible in both transitions .",
    "the integrated fluxes for all transitions are given in table  [ tab : results ] along with the line luminosities , which we derive using the equations given in @xcite .",
    "the values for hcn and hco@xmath2 ground transitions are consistent with previous results from @xcite and @xcite for both molecules and @xcite for hcn .",
    "the fluxes and luminosities given in table  [ tab : results ] imply a hcn(1@xmath10)/co(1@xmath10 ) flux ratio of 0.084 or a luminosity ratio of 0.14 , and a hco@xmath2(1@xmath10)/co(1@xmath10 ) flux ratio of 0.077 or a luminosity ratio of 0.13 , which is similar to other starbursts ( e.g. , @xcite ) . if only measuring the co flux in those pixels where there is hcn emission , the co flux decreases by 12% , indicating that there is relatively little diffuse co emission present around the bright nucleus .    for all three molecules we measure the peak surface brightness at the central position : co(1@xmath10 ) , 2.4jybeam@xmath11 , ; hcn(1@xmath10 ) , 0.49jybeam@xmath11 ; and hco@xmath2(1@xmath10 ) , 0.38jybeam@xmath11 . from this",
    "we determine the peak brightness temperature using the conversions 6.95jyk@xmath11 at 115.27ghz and 14.9jyk@xmath11 at 89ghz for our observations and derive the following temperatures : 17k for co(1@xmath10 ) , 7.3k for hcn(1@xmath10 ) , and 5.7k for hco@xmath2(1@xmath10 ) .",
    "thus , our co data set a lower limit to the kinetic temperature @xmath24k ( planck temperature ) .",
    "the co(1@xmath10 ) brightness temperature is in agreement with @xcite , although it is somewhat lower than the 36k derived by @xcite at comparable angular resolution .    for several high redshift sources",
    "it has been found that lines from hcn appear to be narrower than the co lines .",
    "this is the case for the cloverleaf quasar @xcite , apm08279 + 5255 @xcite , and irasf10214 + 4724 @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that this indicates that the dense gas is more concentrated around the nucleus .",
    "even though ngc253 does not match these high redshift galaxies in far - infrared luminosity , we extract the spectra for co(1@xmath10 ) , hcn(1@xmath10 ) , and hco@xmath2(1@xmath10 ) ( shown in fig .",

    "here we find that the line widths are the same for all three lines .",

    "the continuum emission as seen at 20 cm is dominated by synchrotron emission and the 3 mm emission is likely a combination of free - free emission and dust continuum .",

    "the apex data in comparison to the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) data have a much broader bandwidth and thus result in a much more reliable baseline subtraction and total fluxes .",

    "similarly , higher densities over - predict the 3@xmath12 and 4@xmath13 lines even for very cold temperatures of 15k .",
    "the kinetic temperature is poorly constrained from the models ( see also the lvg models in @xcite ; our fig .",
    "[ fig : lvg27sec ] , dotted and dashed lines ) ; however , a kinetic temperature of 50k is the most plausible solution as it is consistent with the dust temperature @xcite and also in agreement with models of the co sed @xcite .",
    "we note that a temperature of @xmath55k , as derived by @xcite , can not be ruled out by the model . with this ,",
    "a good match to both line seds in our fixed chemistry framework is provided by an h@xmath52 density of 10@xmath56 @xmath7 , a kinetic gas temperature of @xmath57k , and an area filling factor of about 1% ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lvg27sec ] solid line ) .",
    "all solutions which match the data predict that hcn and hco@xmath2 lines are _ optically thick and subthermally excited _ , even in the ground transition of hcn and hco@xmath2 . for the 50k model",

    "emission would be close to being thermalized .",
    "although the area filling factors for hcn and hco@xmath2 differ slightly for a given @xmath60  @xmath61 lvg input , the good agreement of the model predicted seds for hcn and hco@xmath2 with the observations suggests that the emission from hcn and hco@xmath2 arise from a common volume .",
    "we repeat the analysis for the central position of ngc253 after convolving the data to a resolution of 20@xmath13 . for our lvg model with @xmath62 @xmath7 and @xmath57k ,",
    "the results are consistent with those derived from 27@xmath13 resolution .",
    "the only difference is the area filling factor which increases for higher resolution .",
    "if we apply the same lvg model to the total flux within the maps covered by the ovro and apex observations , the lvg predicted hcn and hco@xmath2 ( 4@xmath13 ) fluxes are slightly higher than the observed values which suggests that the hcn and the hco@xmath2 excitation is somewhat lower in the outer most regions of the data cubes . at a fixed temperature of @xmath57k , however , a small decrease of the h@xmath52 density to @xmath63 @xmath7 is sufficient to bring the model prediction and the observations into agreement .    in summary , the constant hcn / hco@xmath2 flux ratio across the starburst disk would require a highly unlikely combination between varying abundances and excitation conditions . hence it is safe to conclude that there is no significant abundance gradient across the disk .",
    "we have used our new hcn observations as well as data from the literature to compare the excitation of the dense gas via the hcn seds in ngc253 , m82 , ngc4945 , ngc6240 , mrk231 and arp220 ( references are given in the caption of fig .",

    "figure  [ fig : normseds ] shows a comparison of the hcn seds of the six galaxies normalized by their hcn(1@xmath10 ) flux density .",
    "this comparison shows that among these sources ngc253 exhibits one of the highest hcn excitations .",
    "given that the hcn emission in ngc253 is subthermally excited , this comparison shows that subthermal hcn is a common property of star forming galaxies .",
    "the only source where the hcn excitation exceeds that of ngc253 is arp220 ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we note , however , that the hcn line intensities of arp220 in @xcite ( which have been used to fit the hcn sed of arp220 in fig.[fig : normseds ] ) are higher by a factor of @xmath64 compared to other studies @xcite .",
    "therefore , the available data is not conclusive and does not allow to rule out that hcn is subthermally excited also in arp220 .",
    "interestingly , ngc6240 and mrk231 show a lower excitation of the dense gas phase compared to ngc253 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : normseds ] ) despite their much higher fir luminosities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hcnhco_vs_lir ] ) .",
    "while our results show that the hcn / hco@xmath2 ratio is statistically constant across the starburst disk , we do inspect the details . in figure",
    "[ fig : ratios ] we plot the hcn / hco@xmath2 flux ratios as function of the 20 cm fluxes for each pixel . towards higher 20",
    "cm flux , there are three data points which hint at a higher hcn / hco@xmath2 ratio ( this increase is due to a relative decrease of the hco@xmath2 emission ) .",
    "they correspond to the peak in the 20 cm flux .",
    "this is also towards the peak of the hard x - ray emission as measured with _",
    "@xcite , where it is possible that there is an absorbed active galactic nucleus ( agn ) present in the very center of ngc253 @xcite . while these data points are within the scatter , we speculate that the small increase in the hcn / hco@xmath2 ratio could be a consequence of the presence of an agn based on the relations suggested by @xcite .",
    "this , however , can only be resolved when future instruments with larger resolving power and higher sensitivity will become available .",
    "the line ratio between hcn and hco@xmath2 has been studied for several classes of star forming galaxies , mostly through single - dish observations @xcite , where ratios have been found in the range 0.5 - 2.7 .",
    "@xcite presented a data set of hcn / hco@xmath2 for luminous ir galaxies ( lirgs ; @xmath67l@xmath68 ) and ultra - luminous ir galaxies ( ulirgs ; @xmath69l@xmath68 ) .",
    "they present a possible correlation between the hcn / hco@xmath2 ratio and the ir luminosity .",
    "if , however , other measurements from the literature , including those of less luminous star forming galaxies and a recent high - redshift measurement @xcite are included in such a plot , there remains little evidence for such a correlation with @xmath70 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hcnhco_vs_lir ] ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "the large number of galaxies with @xmath65/@xmath71 seems surprising at the first glance since the emission in both lines is likely optically thick in all galaxies ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the critical densities of hco@xmath2 are lower than those for hcn . from this",
    "one would expect that the hco@xmath2(1@xmath10 ) line is brighter than the hcn(1@xmath10 ) line if both molecules trace the same gas .",
    "however , as both molecules are subthermally excited , their line intensity depends on the underlying chemistry despite their high optical depth .",
    "this is exemplified in figure  [ fig : chemistry ] , where we show the lvg predicted @xmath65/@xmath66 ratio as a function of reasonable hcn and hco@xmath2 abundance for different h@xmath52 densities . from the plot",
    "it can be seen that a decrease of the hco@xmath2 abundance can indeed explain even the highest observed line ratios independent on the underlying density of the gas .",
    "alternatively , an increase of the hcn abundance will also increase the @xmath65/@xmath66 ratio .",
    "the latter process , however , is only effective for h@xmath52 gas densities below a few times 10@xmath72@xmath7 , as for higher densities hcn(1@xmath10 ) will become thermalized and , therefore , insensitive to abundance variations .",
    "given the gas density derived by us for ngc253 ( 10@xmath56@xmath7 ) , both processes can effectively modify the observed line ratio .",
    "a decrease of the hco@xmath2 abundance due to the ionizing field produced by cosmic rays has been proposed by @xcite .",
    "cosmic rays ionize h@xmath52 , leading to the production of h@xmath73 , which reacts with co to form hco@xmath2 .",
    "the abundance of hco@xmath2 is thus affected by ratio of cosmic  ray ionization rate and gas density .",
    "while a higher ionizing flux favours the production of hco@xmath2 , it also increases the number of free electrons , which leads to a higher probability for recombination . at a gas density of @xmath74@xmath7 , an ionizing field comparable to that of the galaxy",
    "may already be strong enough to significantly decrease the abundance of hco@xmath2 due to dissociative recombination of h@xmath73 ( e.g.  phillips & lazio @xcite ) .",
    "theoretical modelling by @xcite and @xcite suggest that for modest column densities @xmath75@xmath76 the presence of an embedded x - ray source , such as an agn , can enhance the hcn / hco@xmath2 and hcn / co abundance ratios relative to a pure uv source , such as young massive stars in a starburst .",
    "note , however , that for larger column densities the reverse would be true .",
    "there are hints of enhanced hcn / hco@xmath2 ratios in nearby seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "nonetheless , similar enhancements are not found for the far - infrared bright cloverleaf qso @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation for the observed variations of the @xmath65/@xmath66 ratio could be that hco@xmath2 and hcn are not arising form the same volume . from an analysis of the dense gas properties in arp220 and ngc6240 , @xcite recently concluded , that the hco@xmath2 emission is dominantly emitted from regions with 10 times lower density than hcn . in this picture",
    "the @xmath65/@xmath66 ratio would then be explained by the relative area filling factors of the denser cores and the less dense surounding medium in combination with the excitation conditions in both gas phases .",
    "this picture , however , is not supported by our observation of ngc253 , where the excitation of both molecules can be explained by a single density  temperature combination .",
    "we have presented maps of hcn(1@xmath10 ) and hco@xmath2(1@xmath10 ) obtained with ovro and observations of hcn(4@xmath13 ) and hco@xmath2(4@xmath13 ) obtained with apex of the starburst disk of ngc253 .",
    "we find that the spatial distribution of the two molecules is very similar , even when compared on a channel - by - channel basis .",
    "we find the ratio between hcn(1@xmath10 ) and hco@xmath2(1@xmath10 ) is @xmath3 across the whole circumnuclear starburst region independent of the strength of the central radiation field .",
    "the emission from the and transitions , both indicators of the dense molecular gas , trace regions that are non  distinguishable within the uncertainties of our observations .    from an excitation analysis",
    "we find that both molecules are subthermally excited and that their emission lines are optically thick .",
    "the constant line ratio implies that there are no strong abundance gradients across the starburst disk .",
    "a consequence of both molecules being subthermally excited is that the line intensity is sensitive to the underlying chemistry despite their high optical depth .",
    "this finding may also explain the variations in @xmath77 between different star forming galaxies .",
    "the advent of the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) , expanded very large array ( evla ) , and square kilometer array ( ska ) will open up improved prospects for observations of dense molecular gas phase in galaxies through molecular line transitions such as hcn and hco@xmath2 at low and high redshifts . as both hcn and hco@xmath2 appear to trace the same dense gas regions where the formation of the stars are taking place , observations of these two molecules will be important probes in future projects aimed at studying galaxies during phases of the build - up of their stellar mass .",
