    "decay of a heavy particle with a photon in the final state can often lead to experimental signals for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "recent literature contains many studies , both experimental and theoretical , devoted to signals of the type @xmath2 + @xmath3 , @xmath4 + @xmath3 etc .",
    "@xcite in the context of various new physics scenarios . a rather large fraction of such studies",
    "are concerned with supersymmetric ( susy ) @xcite theories .",
    "for example , in models with gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb)@xcite , the decay of the lightest neutralino ( @xmath0 ) ( next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle in these models ) into a photon and a gravitino can give rise to @xmath2 + @xmath3 ( or @xmath4 + @xmath3 ) which can have substantial event rates even after subtracting the standard model backgrounds . the signal @xmath2 + @xmath3",
    "is in fact the most probable discovery channel of gmsb .",
    "side by side , radiative decay of the second lightest neutralino(@xmath5 ) , in a scenario based on n = 1 supergravity ( sugra ) , into a photon and the lightest neutralino ( @xmath0 , the lightest supersymmetric particle in this class of models ) can sometimes give rise to similar final states in colliders from a pair of @xmath5 s or from a @xmath6 pair .",
    "it requires a careful investigation to distinguish the latter type of signals from the former to establish the reality of gmsb vis - a - vis the sugra - type mode of supersymmetry breaking @xcite .    in view of this , it is important to know whether there can be other new physics options which allow radiative decay of a heavier particle into a photon and another invisible particle , leading to signals of the same kind as those discussed above , and , in some cases , faking the gmsb signals which are being looked for so carefully .",
    "it will be obvious that the closest kinematical resemblance to the gmsb signal is borne when the invisible particle is a near - massless neutral fermion , for which the immediate candidate is a neutrino .",
    "now , radiative decay of a heavier neutral fermion into a neutrino becomes a distinct possiblity in r - parity violating susy @xcite where the lightest neutralino can decay in this vein at the one - loop level .",
    "this motivates one to undertake an exhaustive study of the radiative decay @xmath7 in an r - parity violating scenario , to see whether in some region of the parameter space this kind of a decay can have an appreciable branching ratio in spite of the allowed tree - level decay channels of the lightest neutralino . in this paper , we have attempted such a study , taking into account r - parity violation through both bilinear and trilinear terms in the superpotential .",
    "it should be mentioned that @xmath7 has been calculated in some earlier works @xcite where either the composition of the lightest neutralino has been confined to certain limits , or some specific regions of the susy parameter space have been adhered to .",
    "our purpose , on the other hand , is to make a detailed scan of the parameter space , and the results presented by us highlight those particular regions where the branching ratio can be of the largest magnitude .",
    "this , we feel , is necessary to establish the authenticity of , for example , gmsb signals during collider searches .",
    "we also go beyond the assumption of gaugino mass unification at the scale of grand unified theories ( gut ) and present some results with the @xmath8 and @xmath9 gaugino masses treated as independent parameters , to probe whether radiative neutralino decays with enhanced rates ensue upon freeing the susy standard model from a gut embedding . and lastly , we take into account the fact that r - parity violating susy is being invoked in recent times to explain the generation of neutrino masses @xcite in consonance with the superkamiokande data on atmospheric neutrinos @xcite .",
    "thus a section of our results pertains to that particular region of the parameter space where the indicated hierarchy of neutrino masses , together with large angle mixing between the second and the third generations , is reproduced .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the basic framework of the r - parity violating model used in our calculations . in section 3 ,",
    "some details of the loop calculation are presented .",
    "section 4 contains our numerical results for various scenarios as well as for different choices of the parameters .",
    "we summarise and conclude in section 5 .",
    "detailed forms of the loop integrals are outlined in the appendix .",
    "the fact that all the particles in the standard model carrying baryon ( b ) and lepton ( l ) number are fermions , with fixed gauge multiplet stuctures , implies that b and/or l can not be violated by one unit .",
    "thus one can not write down renormalizable terms in the lagrangian which violate b or l or both .",
    "this is no longer true in the case of supersymmetric theories where the particle spectrum is now doubled and baryon number and lepton number are assigned to the supermultiplets .",
    "one can now have scalar particles containing b or l , and it is possible to have terms with @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "however , the scenario has to be made consistent with the non - observation of proton decay which requires the simultaneous violation of b and l. this is ensured in an over - restrictive manner in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , by imposing a discrete multiplicative symmetry called r - parity defined as @xmath12 , which equals + 1 for standard model particles and -1 for the superpartners .",
    "an immediate consequence of r - parity conservation is that the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is stable .    the conservation of r - parity , however , is not prompted by any strong theoretical reason , and theories where r is violated through nonconservation of _ either _ b _ or _ l are perfectly consistent with stability of the proton .",
    "such scenarios can be studied by genaralising the mssm superpotential to the following form :    @xmath13    with @xmath14 and @xmath15    in this paper we shall assume that the b - violating piece @xmath16 is not there . also , we discuss the l - violating terms in two separate categories for the convenience of analysis , considering , in turn , @xmath17 with either the bilinear ( @xmath18 ) @xcite or the trilinear ( @xmath19- and @xmath20 ) @xcite terms existing in the superpotential at a time .",
    "@xmath21    we simplify the analysis here by assuming a bilinear r - parity violating term involving only the third leptonic generation .",
    "all the imporatnt features of such a scenario can be seen within simplified framework .    at first sight",
    "it appears that the @xmath22-term can be rotated away from the superpotential by properly redefining the @xmath23 and @xmath24 fields , so that    @xmath25    @xmath26    now as a result of this rotation the superpotential takes the form :    @xmath27 & - & \\frac { h_{ij}^d \\epsilon } { \\mu ' } { \\hat q}_i { { \\hat l}'}_3 { \\hat d}_j^c   - \\frac { h_{ij}^l \\epsilon } { \\mu ' } { \\hat l}_i { { \\hat l}'}_3 { \\hat e}_j^c   + \\frac { h_{ij}^l \\mu } { \\mu ' } { \\hat l}_i { { \\hat h}'}_1 { \\hat e}_j^c \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which means that the @xmath19- and @xmath20 type terms are generated in general and in the last two terms @xmath28 .    but more importantly",
    ", it should be noted that the scalar potential has terms of the following forms in the original basis :    @xmath29    where we have written down the f - term and soft breaking terms relevant for our purpose here .",
    "it is evident that such terms will generate , in general , a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath30 for the sneutrino .",
    "the basis rotation regenerates such terms , and therefore the sneutrino vev is in general non - vanishing as the special consequence of bilinear r - parity violation whenever soft susy breaking is there @xcite .",
    "thus there are two ways of parametrizing a bilinear r - parity violating scenario : ( i ) with @xmath22-term present in the superpotential together with a vev of the sneutrino , and ( ii ) with @xmath22-term rotated away from the superpotential but the vev of the sneutrino ( in the rotated basis ) embodying the l - violating effects that the former would imply in , say , the neutralino and chargino mass matrices .",
    "of course , the parameter @xmath22 takes refuge in this case in the scalar potential together with the soft breaking parameter @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath31 can be eliminated by using the conditions for electroweak symmetry breaking , if @xmath22 and @xmath30 are used as independent variables .",
    "our calculations here are done in a basis where both @xmath22 and @xmath30 ( vev of the sneutrino ) are present in the superpotential .",
    "now , the presence of @xmath22 and @xmath30 will induce a kind of mixing in the fermionic as well as in the scalar sector of the theory , which is typical of bilinear r - parity violation . in the fermionic sector neutralinos",
    "will mix with the tau - neutrino and the charginos , with the tau lepton .",
    "consequently , the neutralino mass matrix takes the following form :    @xmath32    where the successive rows and columns correspond to ( @xmath33 ) . here",
    "@xmath34    @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the @xmath37 and @xmath38 gaugino mass parameters respectively , @xmath39 , the higgsino mass parameter , and @xmath40 evidently , this will result in the generation of ( majorana ) masses for the third generation neutrino at tree - level through a see - saw type mechanism @xcite .",
    "in such a situation , the @xmath41 chargino mass matrix is @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and  @xmath45 ,  @xmath35 being the @xmath46 gaugino mass parameter .",
    "here we have assigned @xmath47 along the rows and @xmath48 along the columns .    similarly , in the scalar sector",
    "neutral and charged scalar mass matrices are enlarged as a result of the mixing between charged sleptons and charged higgs and sneutrino with the neutral higgs . in the neutral scalar sector the scalar mass - squared matrix in the basis @xmath49 takes the form :    @xmath50    in a similar way , the neutral pseudoscalar mass - squared matrix becomes @xmath51 in the basis @xmath52 and takes the form : @xmath53    in the charged scalar sector the charged scalar mass - squared matrix becomes @xmath54 in the basis @xmath55 and is given by @xmath56 with    @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63    in addition to constraints coming from electroweak symmetry breaking , the requirement of electric charge conservation subjects the parameters in the potential to appropriate conditions in any given scenario .",
    "in the calculations here , we make the following choice of independent parameters :    @xmath64 .",
    "we also take the ramaining scalar mass parameters to be as follows :    @xmath65    and    @xmath66    where , @xmath67 is the ratio of two higgs vacuum expectation values , @xmath68 is the usual b - term corresponding to the @xmath39-term , a s are the trilinear soft breaking terms .",
    "the bilinear r - parity violating parameters @xmath22 and @xmath30 can be constrained from different experimental considerations such as the tau - mass measured within the existing errors , and , most importantly , from the constraints on neutrino masses .",
    "the latter can be subjected to current laboratory bounds , but the restriction becomes more stringent on using the superkamiokande results on atmospheric neutrinos . in this light , the values of @xmath22 and @xmath30 have to be constrained in such a way that the sneutrino vev is less than a few hundred kev s in the basis where @xmath22 is rotated away . with @xmath69 have to be included in order to explain @xmath70 oscillation .",
    "this requires a straightforward extension of the formalism described above . for more details ,",
    "the reader is referred to ref . @xcite . ]    the above kind of mixing in the chargino , neutralino and scalar sectors results in physical states which are superpositions of neutral(charged ) leptons and neutralinos(charginos ) on one hand , and higgses and sleptons(sneutrinos ) on the other .",
    "this implies that the yukawa and gaugino coupling terms , written in terms of the physical states , will give rise to _ all _ the interactions of the @xmath19 and @xmath20-types .",
    "in addition , the fact that gaugino couplings play a role here makes it possible to free some of the terms from constraints due to gauge invariance of the superpotential .",
    "one such interaction term has particular importance in our calculation , namely one involving a top quark , a stop and a state which is dominantly a neutrino .",
    "this is clearly a result of neutrino - neutralino mixing and the quark - squark neutralino interaction in the lagrangian . for more details the reader",
    "is referred to @xcite .    also , a scenario like this allows one to have tau - neutralino - w and neutrino - neutralino - z couplings .",
    "this results in additional decay modes of a neutralino which are characteristic of bilinear r - parity violation @xcite .",
    "@xmath71    in such a case the requirement of gauge invariance implies that @xmath72s are antisymmetric in the first two indices due to @xmath8 invariance but @xmath73s are not subjected to such constraints .",
    "thus we have nine @xmath19 and twenty seven @xmath20-type couplings other than the mssm parameter space .",
    "these trilinear couplings can also be constrained in various ways like , for example , lepton universality violation @xcite , neutrinoless double beta decay @xcite , majorana mass of neutrino @xcite , flavor changing neutral current processes @xcite etc .",
    "their implications in various high energy collider experiments such as lep @xcite , hera @xcite or the fermilab tevatron @xcite have also been widely explored .",
    "in addition , they can be responsible for neutrino masses generated at the one - loop level @xcite .",
    "before we end this section , it may be remarked that although constraints on the r - violating parameters are frequently talked about , in practice these constraints will always have to stipulate a given set of values of the r - conserving ( mssm ) parameters .",
    "the one - loop calculation of the decay @xmath74 has been performed in the nonlinear r - gauge . a similar calculation for the radiative decay of heavier neutralinos into lighter ones",
    "can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this gauge , choice of the gauge fixing term modifies certain types of vertices compared to , say , the t hooft - feynman gauge .",
    "for example , the @xmath75 vertex ( where @xmath76 is the charged goldstone boson ) is abesnt in the non - linear r - gauge , whereas the @xmath77 vertex gets correspondingly modified .",
    "also a set of diagrams involving a @xmath78 transition ( with an off - shell z ) , which potentially contributes to the process under investigation , gives zero contribution when one sums over all the loops .",
    "the diagrams which ultimately contribute in the bilinear r - parity violating scenario are the triangle diagrams shown in fig .",
    "1 . a subset of these will be present when one considers only trilinear lepton number violating terms in the superpotential , the relevant diagrams being ( a ) and ( b ) involving only the down - type quark / squark or lepton / sleptons in the loop .",
    "this is actually a consequence of @xmath8 invariance of the superpotential and can be seen explicitly if one expands the @xmath19- and @xmath20-type terms into their component forms .",
    "the appearance of additional diagrams in the bilinear r - parity violating case can be attributed to mixing in the scalar and lepton - chargino - neutralino sectors , once electroweak symmetry breaking takes place ( see section 2 ) .",
    "in fact , as has already been mentioned , one of the main reasons for undertaking this study with bilinear r - parity violation is the presence of the additional diagrams involving the top quark and the w - boson , which are potential sources of enhancement of the decay amplitude .",
    "since the photon is on - shell , @xmath79 gauge invariance demands that the transition amplitude be proportional to @xmath80 thus one expects the following form for the matrix element : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the mass of @xmath0 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the signs of the mass eigenvalues of @xmath85 and the neutrino respectively .",
    "thus , depending on @xmath83 and @xmath84 , the effective @xmath86 interaction is either proportional to @xmath87 or @xmath88 .",
    "the radiative decay width of @xmath0 is then given by @xmath89 where we have neglected the mass of the neutrino and @xmath90 , containing details of the loop integrals , has the dimension of inverse mass - squared .    in order to calculate @xmath91",
    "one has to evaluate the triangle graphs . for a given set of internal particles",
    "there are two diagrams which differ from each other by the direction of charge flow in the loop . in the figures we have shown only one set of diagrams .",
    "one must be careful about the diagrams involving the reverse flow of charge in the loop because in those cases one encounters vertices with clashing arrows .",
    "the integrals which appear during the loop calculations are regularized using dimensional regularization .",
    "since there is no tree - level coupling of the type @xmath86 the divergences must cancel among each gauge invariant subset of diagrams .",
    "for example , the diagrams ( g ) and ( h ) and their partner graphs where the direction of charge flow is reversed form a gauge invariant subset and it can be shown that the infinities cancel within this set of diagrams .",
    "similarly , one gets a finite result out of the loop diagrams involving fermion / sfermion loops , i.e. , the diagrams @xmath92 and their partner graphs .",
    "this is true , pairwise , for the loops @xmath93 and @xmath94 involving charged higgs boson and charginos and the charged goldstone bosons and the charginos .",
    "the decay amplitude shown in eqn.(13 ) can be decomposed in the following way ( with only the appropriate contributions retained , as stated earlier , with trilinear r - violating terms ) ;    @xmath95    the matrix element due to the four diagrams ( a ) , ( b ) and their partner graphs is given by    @xmath96 & { \\times } & \\sum_{f } e_f c_f \\{(a_lb_r - a_rb_l ) [ \\eta_1 { m_{\\tilde \\chi^0_1 } } ( i^1 - i^3 ) ]   +   m_f ( a_lb_l - a_rb_r)i^2\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath97 is the charge of the fermion @xmath98 in units of e @xmath99 , and @xmath100 is the color factor for the particles in the loop .",
    "one can use this result to include contributions from all possible fermion / scalar loops .",
    "thus contributions from charged higgs and goldstone bosons are also present in the sum over @xmath98 .",
    "we have also explicitly used the sum over the three possible chargino states ( @xmath101 ) in the bilinear r - parity violating scenario .",
    "one must be careful with the masses and couplings as well as about the electric charges of the fermions in the loop .",
    "the integrals @xmath102 are expressible in terms of the general expressions for one - loop three - point functions @xcite , in forms that are presented in the appendix , where we also give the expressions for the combinations @xmath103 and @xmath104 for all the possible cases .    in the case of stop and sbottom",
    "we have included the effect of left - right mixing .",
    "also , the calculation includes possible absorptive parts of the loop integrals , which can be present in particular when the decaying neutralino is heavier than the @xmath105 .    in a similar way ,",
    "the contributions to the matrix element from diagrams ( g ) and ( h ) and their partner graphs are given by    @xmath106 & { \\times } & \\sum_{k } \\{(a_lb_l - a_rb_r ) [ \\eta_1 { m_{\\tilde \\chi^0_1 } } ( i^1 - j^2 -i^3 ) ]   + 2 m_k ( a_lb_r - a_rb_l)j^2\\ } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in both the above expressions , the quantities @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are all assumed to be real .",
    "the loops involving the top quark ( fig.1(a ) and fig.1(b ) ) , which are present only in the case of bilinear r - parity violation , always seem to have a rather important effect . mixing . ] matching contributions also come over a large area of the parameter space from loops involving the w - boson ( and the tau and/or the lighter chargino , depending on the relevant mixing angles ) in the propagator ( diagrams ( g ) and ( h ) ) . the very presence of these diagrams causes the rates for radiative decays to be larger in cases with bilinear r - violating effects than in those with only trilinears , except in those where there is destructive interference between the two types of graphs .",
    "the calculation of the branching ratio for @xmath111 involves the computation of decay widths of the lightest neutralino in all the relevant tree - level two - and three - body decay modes .",
    "the different types of mixing that have been discussed in section 2 for bilinear r - parity violation open up the following two - body decay modes , as and when kinematically allowed :    @xmath112 where h is the lightest higgs boson .",
    "in addition , there are three body tree - level decay channels with both bilinears and trilinears . while the channels @xmath113 are available in both the cases @xcite , additional decays such as @xmath114 and @xmath115 can take place in the former , and can be important when two - body decays are not kinematically allowed .    in all the numerical results presented here ,",
    "we have used @xmath116 .",
    "our finding is that the branching ratio of the radiative decay is rather insensitive to the values of these parameters .",
    "let us first concentrate on bilinear r - parity violating scenario .",
    "we will consider two different cases , namely : ( i ) when the supersymmetry breaking gaugino mass parameters are unified at the grand unification scale , and ( ii ) when @xmath8 and @xmath9 gaugino mass parameters denoted by @xmath117 and @xmath118 respectively are treated as unrelated .",
    "due to reasons explained below , significant contributions to the radiative decay can come only when bilinear r - parity violating effects are present .",
    "there again , the relevant parameters @xmath22 and the sneutrino vev(s ) can be constrained under two different considerations .",
    "if the neutrino - neutralino mixing process in such a scenario is the main mechanism for the generation of ( majorana ) neutrino masses for explaining the superkamiokande ( sk ) results on atmospheric muon neutrinos , then the parameters have to be constrained in such a way that the quantity @xmath119 is less than about 100 kev _ in a basis where the @xmath22-parameters are rotated away from the superpotential_. the numerical results modulo such constraints are denoted by `` with sk '' in the corresponding figure captions , and the results correspond to both the second - and third - generation neutrinos in the final state of the radiative decays . on the other hand , if one ignores the sk constraints , then , with just the laboratory bounds on the tau neutrino mass , the values of @xmath22 and @xmath30 ( i.e. the r - violating parameters in the third generation ) can be as large as on the order of gev s . we have also presented such results , considering only the third ( tau ) neutrino to be there as the decay product .",
    "figures 2 - 9 ( 10 ) show the results of a scan of the parameter space carried out in the different scenarios mentioned above , calculated with bilinear ( trilinear ) r - parity violation .",
    "the first thing that we note is that in all the results presented , a specific set of masses for the squarks and sleptons are assumed .",
    "the branching ratios of the radiative decay , however , are rather insensitive to their variation .",
    "this is because if , for example , we reduce the squark masses , the effect of a lighter stop will increase the decay width for the radiative decay , but the corresponding tree level decays will also undergo a boost via diagrams mediated by squarks .",
    "similarly , a comparison of figures 2 - 4 with 5 - 7 and 8 with 9 reveals that imposing the sk constraints does not cause any appreciable reduction to the probability of obtaining branching ratios on the higher side for similar combinations of mssm parameters .",
    "all that it does is to scale the overall coefficients instrumental in both the loop - and tree - level decays .",
    "this results in branching ratios of similar magnitudes , but is manifested in larger decay lengths for the neutralino when r - parity violating parameters are restricted to yield @xmath120 .",
    "as has already been mentioned , the major contributions to the radiative decay come from _ ( a ) _ the top - stop loop with bilinear r - pariy violation , as well as from loops involving the w - boson and the tau or the lighter chargino .",
    "however , this leads in some regions of the parameter space to the interesting possibility of their cancelling each other .",
    "when such a cancellation is very severe for some specific neutralino mass , the branching ratio is seen to undergo a sharp dip at that point , as seen in fig.3 and fig.8 . in such cases ,",
    "the effective contributions at those points hardly contain any input that is special of the bilinear terms .",
    "on the other hand , in fig.2 ( and partially in fig.3 ) one encounters a situation where the contribution is mainly from the w - loops but the latter undergoes a destructive interference among the various component terms , causing the overall branching ratio to fall at a particular region .",
    "the numerical results show a sensitivity to the mssm parameters @xmath39 and , to a somewhat lesser extent , on @xmath121 .",
    "it is also clear from the graphs that the radiative decay tends to remain suppressed for small values of @xmath122 which is treated here as a free parameter .",
    "it gradually rises with @xmath122 , and then almost saturates , showing a slight fall for @xmath122 approaching a tev .",
    "the loops have the largest contributions for @xmath123 . by and large ,",
    "the corresponding regions of the parameter space have the lightest neutralino almost entirely dominated by the bino state .",
    "when the condition of gagino mass unification is relaxed , the mass parameters @xmath118 and @xmath117 , corresponding to the @xmath9 and @xmath8 gauginos can be unrelated @xcite .",
    "most of the features of the unified scenario , including the possibilities of having branching ratios close to 10 per cent , are seen here also .",
    "however , it entails the additional possibility of having a destructive interference between the top - and w - induced diagrams in cases where the branching ratio is otherwise on the higher side , causing the latter to fall sharply by about 5 orders of magnitudes for a particular value of the neutralino mass , with all other parameters at same values .",
    "this is seen when @xmath117/@xmath118 is smaller than what it would have been with the constraint of unification , and the dip is found to occur when the two masses are quite close to each other .",
    "figure 10 is a sample showing the order of magnitude of the radiative decay with only trilinear r - violating couplings present in the theory .",
    "the values of the @xmath19- and @xmath20-type coupling constants have been used consistently with the current limits @xcite .",
    "we have already seen that the two potentially most important classes of diagrams , namely , those mediated by the top and the w , are absent in such a case .",
    "therefore , it is hardly surprising that the branching ratios can not rise above @xmath124 - @xmath125 over a large part of the parameter space .",
    "the range in which the branching ratio tends to lie in such a case matches , as one would expect , with the one to which it falls when a cancellation of the large contributions takes place in the scenario with bilinears . in any case",
    ", the radiative branching ratio turns out to be too small to be of any observable significance where r - parity is violated only through trilinear terms .    with the maximum value of the branching ratio for the radiative decay being between 5 and 10 per cent , two - photon signals from such decays will fake signals like those of gmsb in only a rather small region of the parameter space .",
    "such a thing might happen when the lighest neutralino in gmsb is close to the kinematic limit of production .",
    "however , the fact that only the bilinear r - violating terms can boost the branching ratio to the level of close to 10 per cent has rather interesting implications in terms of observing distinctive signals of the latter .",
    "for example , pair - produced neutralinos at lep energies ( assuming an intergated luminosity of 500 @xmath126 ) can give rise to about 40 events where there is a radiative decay on one side , leading to signals of the type @xmath127 .",
    "there can be many more of such events in a high - energy electron - positron collider with an integrated luminosity of about 50 @xmath128 . with a proper event selection strategy",
    ", radiative neutralino decay can thus be an interesting signature of r - parity violation with bilinear terms .",
    "we have performed a detailed calculation of the branching ratios for the radiative decay @xmath129 for the lightest neutralino in r - parity violating susy models .",
    "it is seen that the branching ratio can have a maximum value of about 5 - 10% when r - parity violation has its origin in the so - called ` bilinear ' terms in the superpotential , and is insignificantly small for that induced by ` trilinear ' terms .",
    "this , we point out , can be an interesting way of obtaining characteristic signals for the former type of scenario .",
    "our conclusion is that the chances of such radiative decays faking the two - photon signals for gauge - mediated susy breaking are small , except where the lightest neutralino in the latter is close to the kinematic limit of production .",
    "it is also seen that the accessible region corresponding to the mssm parameter space does not change appreciably upon subjecting the theory to constraints from neutrino mass patterns required by the superkamiokande data on atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "expressions for the mixing parameters @xmath107 , @xmath109 , @xmath108 , @xmath110 for @xmath130-loops in the bilinear r - parity violating scenario : @xmath131 @xmath132 @xmath133 @xmath134 where we have j = 2 and i = 1 .",
    "similarly for charged scalar loops we have :                                          \\(iii ) degenerate sfermion loops : for up - type squarks we can use the same expression as that for the stop loop without the mixing angle corresponding to @xmath140 - @xmath164 mixing .",
    "similarly for down - type squark or charged sleptons , one can use the expressions corresponding to the sbottom loop modulo the mixing factor . also the charges and the color factors should be properly included .              in the case of charged sleptons",
