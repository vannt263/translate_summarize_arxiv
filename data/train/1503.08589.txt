    "the objective is to obtain explicit representations of locally risk - minimizing ( lrm ) strategies of call and put options for the barndorff - nielsen and shephard ( bns ) models : ornstein  uhlenbeck ( ou)-type stochastic volatility models developed by barndorff  nielsen and shephard @xcite , @xcite . on the other hand , local risk - minimization is a very well - known quadratic hedging method of contingent claims for incomplete financial markets .",
    "although its theoretical aspects have been well developed , little is known about its explicit representations .",
    "accordingly , arai and suzuki @xcite have analyzed this problem for lvy markets using malliavin calculus for lvy processes .",
    "they gave in theorem 3.7 of their paper an explicit formula for lrm strategies including some malliavin derivatives . here , lvy markets mean models for which the asset price process is described by a solution to the following stochastic differential equation ( sde ) : @xmath0,\\hspace{3mm}s_0>0,\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is a @xmath2-dimensional brownian motion , @xmath3 a compensated poisson random measure ; and @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are predictable processes . if @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are deterministic , a representation for lrm strategies is given simply under some mild conditions",
    "indeed , @xcite calculated explicitly lrm strategies of call options , asian options , and lookback options for the deterministic coefficient case .",
    "however , according to theorem 3.7 in @xcite , one needs to impose many additional conditions on models with random coefficients .",
    "thus , concrete calculations for such models were set aside .    in this paper",
    ", we obtain explicit lrm strategies for bns models , which are popular examples for the random coefficient case .",
    "in particular , various empirical studies confirm that bns models capture well important stylized features of financial time series . in a bns model , the squared volatility process @xmath7 is given by an ou process driven by a subordinator , that is , a nondecreasing lvy process .",
    "more precisely , @xmath7 is given as a solution to the following sde : @xmath8 where @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is a subordinator without drift .",
    "now , the asset price process @xmath11 of a bns model is described as @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "note that the last term @xmath16 accounts for the leverage effect , which is a stylized fact such that the asset price declines at the moment when volatility increases .",
    "moreover , defining @xmath17 , we denote by @xmath18 the poisson random measure of @xmath19 . hence , we have @xmath20,dx)$ ] . denoting by @xmath21 the lvy measure of @xmath19 , we find @xmath22 is the compensated poisson random measure .",
    "then , the asset price process @xmath11 given in ( [ eq - s ] ) is a solution to the following sde : @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , bns models correspond to instances where @xmath5 in ( [ eq - as ] ) is random .",
    "we shall use theorem 3.7 of @xcite in this paper to derive lrm strategies for bns models described as in ( [ eq - s ] ) .",
    "therefore , the primary part of our discussion lies in confirming all the conditions imposed on theorem 3.7 of @xcite .",
    "in particular , we need to investigate the malliavin differentiability of the density of the minimal martingale measure ( mmm ) , which is an indispensable equivalent martingale measure to discuss lrm strategies . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "literature on lrm strategies for bns models is very limited .",
    "arai @xcite studied this problem for a different setting from ours . in @xcite ,",
    "the volatility risk premium is taken into account , but @xmath25 is restricted to @xmath26 .",
    "hence , @xmath11 is described as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is called the volatility risk premium .",
    "note that @xmath11 is continuous . formulating a malliavin calculus under the mmm",
    ", @xcite gave an explicit representation of lrm strategies .",
    "on the other hand , there is some previous research on mean - variance hedging , which is an alternative quadratic hedging method , for bns models .",
    "cont , tankov and voltchkova @xcite , and kallsen and pauwels @xcite studied this problem assuming @xmath11 is a martingale .",
    "kallsen and vierthauer @xcite treated the case where @xmath29 .",
    "recently , benth and detering @xcite dealt with the bns model framework to represent a future price process on electricity assuming that @xmath11 is a martingale and @xmath29 .",
    "in addition , we also develop in this paper a numerical scheme for lrm strategies for call options using the method of arai , imai and suzuki @xcite , which is a numerical scheme of lrm strategies for exponential lvy models .",
    "their scheme is based on the so - called carr ",
    "madan approach @xcite , which is based on the fast fourier transform ( fft ) .",
    "moreover , we compare lrm strategies with the so - called delta - hedging strategies , which are given as the partial derivative of the option price with respect to the asset price .    the outline of this paper is as follows . after giving preliminaries in section 2",
    ", we address the main results in section 3 .",
    "theorem [ thm - main ] gives an explicit representation of lrm strategies for put options .",
    "lrm strategies for call options are provided as its corollary .",
    "a proof of theorem [ thm - main ] is discussed in section 4 .",

    "numerical experiments for lrm strategies are illustrated in section 6 .",
