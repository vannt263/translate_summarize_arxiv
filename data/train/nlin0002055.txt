    "in the theory of quantum chaos , the connection between the chaotic behavior of classical systems and specific properties of their quantum mechanical counterparts has received much attention .",
    "the most studied issues in this context are the statistical properties of nuclear and atomic spectra @xcite and of two-(recently three ) dimensional billiards @xcite . in the mid - eighties ,",
    "a conjecture ( which became known as the bgs conjecture @xcite ) was made that the quantal energy level spacing of ( ergodic ) systems whose classical equivalent exhibit chaotic behavior obeys the wigner gaussian - orthogonal - ensemble statistics , known from random matrix theory , whereas for classically integrable systems the poisson distribution applies .",
    "exceptions to this conjecture are known @xcite , but it is generally believed that these form a set of measure zero .    another way to make a connection between the chaotic behavior of classical systems and specific properties of their quantum mechanical counterparts is to look at the eigenstates of billiards .",
    "eigenstates of a stadium may exhibit structure that corresponds to the classical orbits @xcite .",
    "these structures , called scars , have been directly related to unstable periodic orbits @xcite .",
    "visual inspection of movies that show the time evolution of the probability distribution of a quantum particle moving in two and three - dimensional ( 2d and 3d ) billiards of different shapes strongly suggest that these sequences of images may contain enough information to distinguish between classically integrable and chaotic systems@xcite .    to our knowledge the morphology of the patterns of time ( in)dependent probability distributions has not been studied . in this paper",
    "we propose a method , based on concepts from integral geometry , to perform a morphological image analysis ( mia ) of the probability distribution .",
    "we use mia to characterize the solutions of the time - dependent schrdinger equation for various 2d and 3d billiards .",
    "we demonstrate that indeed , one can define geometrical and topological descriptors that are useful to distinguish between classically integrable and chaotic billiards .",
    "our motivation to analyze time - dependent instead of stationary probability distributions is that the former usually provide information about many eigenstates simultaneously . by following the system over a sufficiently long period of time ,",
    "one collects information on all those eigenstates that have non - negligible overlap with the initial state .",
    "this `` parallelism '' , absent in the stationary - state approach@xcite , reduces the computational work .",
    "mia amounts to the characterization of the geometry and topology of any pattern or series of patterns by means of the so - called minkowski functionals , known from integral geometry @xcite .",
    "these functionals are related to familiar quantities : in two ( three ) dimensions they correspond to the covered area , perimeter and connectivity ( volume , surface area , integral mean curvature and connectivity ) of the pattern . in integral geometry",
    "the calculation of the minkowski functionals is relatively straightforward and requires little computational effort .",
    "mia has proven to be a powerful tool in different fields where the description of patterns is important : statistical physics , to describe the morphology of porous media and complex fluids ; cosmology , to analyze the large scale distribution of matter in the universe ; chemistry , to describe the morphology of patterns in reaction diffusion systems @xcite ; seismology , to describe the spatial complexity of regional seismicity realizations@xcite ; polymer science , to identify and quantify the morphology of mesoscale structures in block copolymers @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the semi - classical limit the sum of exponentials of eigenfrequencies of a billiard - shaped drum can be written in terms of the minkowski functionals of the billiard@xcite , and the weyl hypothesis states that the number of energy levels up to an energy @xmath0 can be written in a similar manner ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in section 2",
    "we briefly review the theory of minkowski functionals and explain the technique of mia in more detail .",
    "we then apply mia to the motion of a quantum particle in various two and three - dimensional billiards and show that an appropriate quantity can be defined to distinguish classically integrable and chaotic billiards .",
    "finally , we study the transition to chaos for a system whose degree of chaos is parametrized .",
    "at the heart of mia lies the computation of minkowski functionals of an arbitrary ( thresholded ) image . therefore",
    ", in this section we will give some mathematical background on minkowski functionals ( closely following @xcite ) and sketch the outline of an algorithm to compute these functionals .",
    "we first define the minkowski functionals for compact convex sets .",
    "the parallel set @xmath1 of a compact convex set @xmath2 at a distance @xmath3 is the union of all closed balls of radius @xmath3 , the centers of which are points in @xmath2 .",
    "the well - known euclidean measures of @xmath1 , such as the area and volume , can be written as polynomials in @xmath3 .",
    "for example , the parallel volume of a square @xmath4 and a cube @xmath5 with edge lengths @xmath6 are given by @xmath7 in general , the volume @xmath8 in @xmath9 dimensions of the parallel set @xmath1 at distance @xmath3 of @xmath2 is given by the steiner formula @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the minkowski functionals .",
    "for the first three dimensions it can be shown that@xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote respectively the length , area , perimeter , volume , surface area , mean breath and euler characteristic or connectivity number of the convex set @xmath2 .",
    "the mean breath @xmath15 is closely related to the mean curvature @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the principal radii of curvature@xcite .",
    "the euler characteristic @xmath19 is related to the gaussian curvature @xmath20 and is equal to unity for a convex body@xcite .",
    "the mean curvature and the gaussian curvature are two useful measures of the curvature of a surface@xcite .",
    "if the local surface geometry has an elliptic , euclidean or hyperbolic shape respectively then the gaussian curvature is respectively positive , zero or negative@xcite .    up to now",
    ", we have limited the discussion to convex sets . in order to deal with the more general sets one encounters in characterizing images",
    ", we consider the convex ring @xmath21 , which is the class of all subsets @xmath22 which can be expressed as finite unions of compact convex sets @xmath23 @xmath24 the euler characteristic @xmath19 is defined as an additive functional on @xmath21 , so that for @xmath25 @xmath26 and where for compact convex sets @xmath2 @xmath27 the euler characteristic describes @xmath22 in a pure topological way , i.e. without reference to any kind of metric .",
    "it can be shown that this definition of @xmath19 permits all minkowski functionals on @xmath21 to be written in terms of @xmath19 and the kinematical density @xcite .",
    "the functional @xmath19 as defined in integral geometry is the same as the euler characteristic defined in algebraic topology @xcite : for @xmath28 , @xmath19 equals the number of connected components minus the number of holes and in three dimensions @xmath19 is given by the number of connected components minus the number of tunnels plus the number of cavities .",
    "for example , for a solid cube @xmath29 , for a hollow cube @xmath30 and for a cube pierced by a tunnel @xmath31 . for multiply connected structures",
    "the euler characteristic is negative . for complex structures it is often difficult to identify the number of connected components , tunnels and cavities .",
    "however , mia directly yields @xmath19 as will be explained below .    in order to calculate the morphological properties of a particular image",
    "we first convert the image to a black - and - white picture using a threshold .",
    "pixels ( voxels ) with intensity below the threshold are considered to be part of the background and the others are building up the objects in the 2d ( 3d ) picture . according to integral geometry , the morphological properties of the various objects building up the black - and - white picture can be completely described in terms of minkowski functionals @xcite . in order to calculate the minkowski functionals in an efficient way we consider each pixel ( voxel ) as the union of the disjoint collection of its interior , faces ( for the 3d case only ) , open edges and vertices .",
    "the values of @xmath22 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath4 , @xmath15 and @xmath19 for these single open structures can easily be calculated @xcite . by making use of the property of additivity of the minkowski functionals and",
    "the fact that there is no overlap between open bodies on a lattice , we compute the minkowski functionals of the whole image by starting from a complete white image , by calculating the change in the number of interiors , faces ( for the 3d case only ) , open edges and vertices when one pixel ( voxel ) is added to the 2d ( 3d ) image , and this until all pixels ( voxels ) building up the picture are added .",
    "the minkowski functionals can then be computed from @xmath34 where @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) denote the number of squares ( cubes ) in 2d ( 3d ) , @xmath37 counts the number of faces ( in 3d only ) , @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote the number of edges and vertices respectively . from ( 10 )",
    "and ( 11 ) it follows directly that the minkowski functionals contain information about local 4 ( 8)-point correlation functions in 2d ( 3d ) .",
    "a more detailed description of the algorithm and an example of computer code to compute the minkowski functionals is given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the application of mia to the time evolution of the probability distribution of a quantum particle moving in a billiard is straightforward . we solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation for a particle moving in a billiard by a stable and accurate numerical method@xcite . for practical purposes the results obtained are exact .",
    "a time series of snapshots displaying the probability density can easily be extracted from this data .",
    "a collection of digital videos can be found in @xcite .",
    "each pattern of the time series is converted into a black - and - white picture by applying a threshold .",
    "the result of applying a threshold of 10% to a representative image of the probability density is shown in fig.[fig : fig1 ] .",
    "( 8.5,3.85 ) ( 0.5,0.35 ) ( 4.5,0.35 )    for each black - and - white image in the time series we compute the minkowski functionals using the algorithm described above and analyze the behavior of the minkowski functionals as a function of the control parameters such as threshold , initial conditions of the wave packet , and shape of the billiard .",
    "we use gaussian wave packets as initial states and study a variety of classically integrable and non - integrable billiards ( see figs.[fig : fig2 ] , [ fig : pot3d],[fig : fig4 ] ) .",

    "as will become clear from the examples given below , to distinguish between classically integrable and chaotic systems it is expedient to define the time - averaged minkowski functionals @xmath43 and the quantities @xmath44 where @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) in two ( three ) dimensions .",
