    "<S> three - dimensional particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations with the code quickpic are used to illustrate the typical accelerating structures associated with the interaction of an intense laser beam with an underdense plasma in the blowout regime . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations are performed with an externally injected electron beam , positioned in the region of maximum accelerating gradients . as the laser propagates in the plasma , </S>",
    "<S> almost complete electron cavitation occurs , leading to the generation of accelerating fields in excess of 1  gev / cm .    </S>",
    "<S> simulation , lasers , plasma waves , electron accelerators    the recent developments on infrared ( @xmath0 ) , ultra - intense ( @xmath1 ) , ultra - short ( @xmath2  fs ) , and tightly focused ( @xmath3 ) laser beams have opened the possibility to explore new scenarios on laser - plasma interactions , namely electron acceleration in the bubble  @xcite or blowout  @xcite regime of the laser wakefield accelerator ( lwfa )  @xcite . in many lwfa experiments @xcite </S>",
    "<S> the laser intensity is sufficiently high for the radiation pressure of the laser to cause complete electron cavitation . </S>",
    "<S> since ions are essentially stationary during a plasma wave period , a strong space charge is formed that pulls electrons back to the axis . </S>",
    "<S> the wake then assumes a spherical shape  @xcite , with linear accelerating and focusing forces . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the non - linear plasma response , the laser self - modulations also play a key role in lwfa experiments . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the overall laser - plasma dynamics is strongly coupled , and a complete theoretical understanding of typical lwfa experiments is beyond the capabilities of current pure theoretical models .    </S>",
    "<S> simulations play an important role in this matter , by giving deeper insights on the physics of the lwfa , and being also valuable in the modeling and design of new experiments . in the pursuit of higher energy gains , </S>",
    "<S> lower plasma densities are required . </S>",
    "<S> although the peak accelerating field is reduced for lower plasma densities with @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the plasma density , the dephasing / pump - depletion lengths increase with @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the maximum energy gain increases with @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the use of lower densities , however , constitutes a major difficulty to lwfa simulations using standard full pic codes : it requires both finer grids to correctly resolve the laser wavelength , and more simulation time steps to model the increased interaction length . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the use of reduced pic models to examine the laser - plasma interaction in the lwfa is becoming increasingly important . in this paper , we use the reduced pic code quickpic  @xcite to illustrate the properties of the wake created by an intense laser pulse in the presence of an external electron beam . </S>",
    "<S> quickpic works under the quasi - static approximation ( qsa )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the qsa assumes that the typical time for the laser evolution is much larger than the typical time for the plasma response , precluding , however , the physics associated with self - injection . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption is very well verified in the lwfa . in quickpic , </S>",
    "<S> the plasma response is then calculated according a quasi - static field solver for each transverse plasma slice and the laser is advanced through the ponderomotive guiding center approximation . with this approximation larger time steps can be used for the laser evolution , thus leading to computational time savings of more than three orders of magnitude in comparison to standard full pic codes .    </S>",
    "<S> the three - dimensional structures associated with the laser propagation in the blowout regime are illustrated in figure [ fig : fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we use a laser pulse with a central wavelength @xmath8 , focused to @xmath9 , with a duration of 30  fs , and a peak normalized vector potential @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the laser pulse propagates in a plasma with density @xmath11 . a bi - gaussian electron beam is externally injected , with a transverse width of @xmath12 , duration of 20  fs , charge of 1  nc , and traveling with a relativistic factor @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation box moves at the speed of light and it is resolved with @xmath14 cells for the transverse and longitudinal directions respectively , with 16 particles per cell .    </S>",
    "<S> the plasma electrons are almost completely evacuated from the region where the laser is sitting ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1]-(a ) ) . as they return to the axis ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1]-(b ) ) , the plasma electrons feel the repulsive radial coulomb force associated with the externally injected beam , leading to the flattening of the linear focusing force ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1]-(c ) ) . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the wake does not fully close at the end of the first plasma period . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , in the longitudinal direction the accelerating gradient is also flattened by the presence of the electron beam ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1]-(d ) ) .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have presented figures of three - dimensional waves in the blowout regime . </S>",
    "<S> these images clearly illustrate the fundamental structures associated with the lwfa , and allow a better understanding of the physics associated with these experiments . </S>"
