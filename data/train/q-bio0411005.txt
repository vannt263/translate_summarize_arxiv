    "oligonucleotide microarrays are designed to enable the evaluation of simultaneous expression of large numbers of genes in prepared messenger rna samples .",
    "details of the technology and the design and manufacture of affymetrix genechip arrays , the focus of this paper , can be found in the review of nguyen et al.@xcite or at the affymetrix website http://www.affymetrix.com/technology/index.affx .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine physical models of hybridization of rna at the microarray surface in the light of differing responses of perfect match and mismatch probes .    in the manufacture of affymetrix arrays , single strand dna probes , 25 bases in length",
    "are synthesized base by base onto a quartz substrate using a photolithographic process .",
    "they are attached to the substrate via short covalently bonded linker molecules roughly 10 nanometres apart .",
    "a microarray chip surface is divided into some hundreds of thousands of regions called features , commonly 11 to 20 microns square , and with the single strand dna probes within each feature being synthesized to a specific nucleotide sequence .",
    "a key step in the laboratory process of gene detection with microarrays is the hybridization of crna target molecules fractionated to lengths of typically 50 to 200 bases onto the single strand dna probes .",
    "the density of hybridized probe - target duplexes in each feature is detected via intensity measurements of fluorescent dye attached to the target crna molecules .",
    "each gene or est is represented by a set of 11 to 20 ( dependent on the chip type ) pairs of features using sequences of length 25 selected for their predicted hybridization properties and specificity to the target gene .",
    "the first element of the pair , termed the perfect match ( pm ) , is designed to be an exact match to the target sequence , while the second element , the mismatch ( mm ) , is identical except for the middle ( 13th ) base being replaced by its complement .",
    "a number of studies have demonstrated the appropriateness of langmuir adsorption theory for understanding probe - target hybridization at the surface of microarrays .",
    "experimental work includes that of nelson et al.@xcite , peterson et al.@xcite and dai et al.@xcite .",
    "analyses which have sought to match langmuir adsorption isotherms with data from an affymetrix spike - in experiment include those of held et al.@xcite , hekstra et al.@xcite , lemon et al.@xcite , burden et al.@xcite and binder et al.@xcite .",
    "the ultimate aim of such work is to establish a functional relationship between measured fluorescence intensities and underlying target concentration parameterized by known physical properties such as probe base sequences .",
    "if such a relationship could be established , it would offer the possibility of an absolute measure of rna target concentration , as opposed to an arbitrarily defined ` expression measure ' .",
    "fundamental to establishing this relationship is a model which accurately describes the physics of the various steps involved in producing a set of intensity measurements from a given mrna target concentration .",
    "the two steps we focus on in this paper are hybridization at the microarray surface and the subsequent washing step , designed to removed unbound target molecules .",
    "a little recognized shortcoming of existing hybridization models based on langmuir adsorption theory is their inability to explain the differing responses of pm and mm fluorescence intensity signals at saturation concentrations of rna . that the asymptotic response of a mm feature at high pm - specific spike - in concentration should be less than that of the neighbouring pm feature is hardly news to an experimental biologist , and",
    "yet this observation is surprisingly difficult to reconcile with langmuir adsorption theory ( see section  [ sec : inconsistency ] ) .",
    "this problem was discussed in the early experimental work of forman et al.@xcite , who serendipitously recognized the ` unexpected benefit ' of the phenomenon of differential response between pm and mm , but failed to find a satisfactory physical explanation .",
    "it is stated in the manufacturer s web page that ` the reason for including a mm probe is to provide a value that comprises most of the background cross hybridization and stray signal affecting the pm probe .",
    "it also contains a portion of the true target signal.'@xcite consequently , many researchers have come to view the mm signal as primarily an attempt to measure non - specific hybridization and other background signal , though in practice there are problems with using the mm signals for this purpose@xcite . since the mm signals are more than a measure of non - specific hybridization , we will concentrate in this paper on the view that mm features are primarily less responsive versions of the pm features , and seek to understand their differing responses at saturation .",
    "the difference between pm and mm probe signals can then be exploited as the result of a single , well controlled change in one of the many parameters influencing the complicated process of hybridization . from this perspective one can obtain powerful insights into the physics and chemistry of hybridization at the microarray surface .",
    "in section  [ sec : langmuir ] we review the langmuir or hyperbolic isotherm and its relationship to a well known affymetrix spike - in data set .",
    "section  [ sec : physmod ] concentrates on an extension of the adsorption based hybridisation models of hekstra et al.@xcite and halperin et al.@xcite which include the effects of non - specific hybridization , and which we show to be essentially equivalent to each other .",
    "this model is consistent with a hyperbolic response function , as observed in data from spike - in experiments .",
    "however , as we point out in section  [ sec : inconsistency ] , it is unable to explain the observed difference between pm and mm signals at saturation concentrations .",
    "section  [ sec : othereffects ] is a survey of a number of possible improvements to our starting model of hybridisation at the microarray surface , which seek to overcome this shortcoming .",
    "many of these ideas have been canvassed in the literature , though in general they have not been rigorously examined in the light of the hekstra / halperin model . in general , we find no convincing way of explaining the pm / mm difference at saturation by reference only to the hybridisation step . in section  [ sec : washing ]",
    "we consider the post - hybdridisation washing step , and find this to be the most promising explanation for the pm / mm difference . in section  [ sec : summary ]",
    "we summarize our findings and draw conclusions .",
    "many of the technical calculations are relegated to appendices .",
    "langmuir adsorption theory is based on an assumption that there are two competing processes driving hybridization : adsorption , i.e.  the binding of target molecules to immobilized probes to form duplexes , and desorption , i.e.  the reverse process of duplexes dissociating into separate probe and target molecules @xmath0 herein we shall always use the word ` probe ' to indicate single strand dna immobilised on the microarray , ` target ' to indicate rna in solution and ` duplex ' to indicate a bound probe - target pair . both the forward and reverse processes are determined by chemical rate constants which depend on a number of factors including activation energies and temperature .",
    "adsorption models of microarrays often lead to a hyperbolic response function , or equilibrium langmuir isotherm , relating rna target concentration @xmath1 to a measured equilibrium fluorescence intensity @xmath2 , namely @xmath3 the isotherm is defined by three parameters : @xmath4 is the measured background intensity at zero target concentration , @xmath5 is the saturation intensity above background at infinite target concentration , and @xmath6 is the target concentration required to reach half saturation",
    ". the physical origins of these parameters will be discussed in detail below .    in a previous paper",
    "we have carried out an extensive statistical analysis @xcite of fits of the hyperbolic and other response functions to the pm probes in the publicly available data from the affymetrix human hg - u95a latin square spike - in experiment ( http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/sample_data/datasets.affx ) . in this",
    "experiment genes ( or , more precisely , rna transcripts ) were spiked in at cyclic permutations of the set of known concentrations , together with a background of crna extracted from human pancreas .",
    "the data consists of fluorescence intensity values from a set of 14 probesets corresponding to 14 separate genes , each containing 16 probe pairs . for each probeset a set of fluorescence intensity values was obtained for the 14 spiked - in concentrations ( 0 , 0.25 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , ... , 1024 ) pm .",
    "the experiment was replicated three times using microarray chips from different wafers . in common with previous analyses of this data",
    "set , our study concentrated on data from 12 of the 14 genes , omitting data from two defective genes .",

    "recall that , in this paper , we define the word ` specific ' to mean those target crna which are exact complements to the pm sequence , even when dealing with the mm feature . for our purposes , this definition will prove useful given that , for most probe pairs , the dominant part of the mm signal at high spike - in concentrations in the affymetrix experiment appears to come from hybridization of spiked - in target rnas complementary to the pm sequence .",

    "this is clearly a reasonable assumption : physical properties of the chip in the absence of any hybridization , such as reflectance , are unlikely to vary significantly over a distance of a few microns . for the parameter",

    "hence @xmath38 is the same for both members of a neighbouring pm / mm pair .",
    "the hekstra or halperin model formulated above then necessarily entails that @xmath50 , in obvious contradiction with the values of @xmath4 , and @xmath5 obtained by fitting the spike - in data .",

    "( [ theta ] ) entails that at sufficiently high specific target concentration , all probes form duplexes : as @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "that is , all probes in the feature are predicted to form duplexes if saturated with enough specific target , even in the case of the mm feature .",
    "a subtle point to note is that this is true irrespective of the bulk solution melting temperature of duplexes , which is defined as the temperature at which half the total number of single strand targets are free and half are bound as duplexes in bulk solution",

    "we argue that , for the affymetrix spike - in data set @xmath54\\approx x$ ] , the spike - in concentration .",
    "] however , this stoicheiometric constraint does not apply for the adsorption reaction at the microarray surface : because the solution target volume is effectively infinite , the target concentration is unchanged as hybridisation proceeds and the coverage fraction theta increases towards its finite equilibrium value @xmath56 . even above the bulk solution melting temperature , the forward reaction can be forced by setting the target concentration sufficiently high .",
    "the upshot is that , irrespective of temperature , langmuir adsorption theory tells us that a feature will saturate at infinite target concentration .",
    "clearly the above model does not account for all possible effects during the complex process of hybridisaton . in this section",
    "we consider a number of other possible hybridisation effects , some of which have been proposed in the literature as putative explanations for the differing measured pm / mm saturation intensities . in general , we find none of these effects to be a strong candidate , and believe that the explanation of the pm / mm saturation difference is unlikely to lie with the hybridisation step .",
    "the problem of differential pm / mm saturation was recognized in the context of a simple langmuir model without non - specific hybridization by peterson et al.@xcite , who explain their experimental data by invoking a sips isotherm to explain a lower mm response curve at high target concentrations .",
    "the sips isotherm@xcite is an empirical response curve believed to correspond to an adsorption model in which chemical reaction rates are drawn from a pseudo - gaussian distribution .",
    "peterson et al.s experimental results are indeed a good fit to the sips isotherm , however their experiment differs from the conditions of the hybridization of affymetrix chips in one important aspect , namely the hybridization temperature .",
    "the peterson experiment was carried out at a hybridization temperature of 20@xmath57c , while affymetrix microarrays are hybridized at 45@xmath57c .",
    "furthermore , peterson et al .  found that heating the hybridization buffer to 37@xmath57c and then cooling back to 20@xmath57c almost completely removed any difference in equilibrium saturation intensities between pm and mm probes .",
    "this appears to be the effect of a first order phase transition which sets in at a temperature well below the affymetrix hybridisation temperature .",

    "however , textbook descriptions of duplex formation ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite , pages 1215 to 1219 ) imply that hybridization is more accurately described as a two step process : a slow rate determining step in which an initial two or three base pairs form , followed by a fast ` zipping - up ' step involving the remaining base pairs .",
    "measured forward reaction rates for duplex formation may typically be of the order of @xmath65 mol@xmath66sec@xmath66  @xcite , potentially translating to timescales of several hours at picomolar concentrations . in order to establish",
    "more rigorously that the hybridization had reached equilibrium in the spike - in experiment , we have considered in appendix  b a quasi - equilibrium hybridization model with two timescales .",

    "the remaining two bar charts show the analogous contrasts for the difference @xmath122 .",
    "the estimate of this quantity , determined from eq .  ( [ washingrate ] ) , is independent of @xmath38 , and so conclusions drawn from from this bar chart do not rely on the assumption that @xmath38 is uniform from one feature to another . here",
    "the effect of the mismatched base at position 13 is quite noticeable : removing a triple hydrogen bond ( c@xmath123 g ) raises the washing rate more than removing a double hydrogen bond ( a@xmath124u ) or ( t@xmath124a ) .",
    "conversely , the effect of a central mismatch on the washing rate is almost always greater when any of the remaining 24 bases is a weakly bound a or t than a strongly bound c or g. this is entirely in keeping with the washing scenario .",
    "an understanding of the physical processes driving hybridization is essential if the design of expression measures is to advance to a point where target concentration can be measured in absolute terms .",
    "the aim of this paper has been to gain an improved understanding of the physics of oligonucleotide microarrays by exploiting the observed differences in the responses of pm and mm features to known crna target concentrations .",
    "the starting point of this paper is an adsorption model of hybridization at the surface of oligonucleotide microarrays based on models proposed independently by hekstra et al.@xcite and halperin et al.@xcite . though arrived at from different approaches",
    "the hekstra and halperin models are essentially equivalent , and are an improvement on their predecessors in that they allow for the presence of cross - hybridization from non - specific targets .",
    "we have mainly concentrated on seeking to explain the commonly observed difference between fluorescence intensity measurements from a neighbouring pm / mm pair of features at high specific target concentration .",
    "that is , if a sufficiently high concentration of pm - specific rna target is spiked in to the target solution , both the pm and mm fluorescence intensity signals will reach an asymptote , but the mm asymptote is almost invariably observed to be lower than the pm asymptote .",
    "our starting hekstra / halperin model incorrectly predicts 100% coverage with pm - specific duplexes of both pm and mm features under these conditions , which in turn incorrectly implies that the asymptotic pm and mm fluorescence signals will be equal .    we have sought to resolve this discrepancy firstly by taking a more detailed look at the hybridisation step , and secondly by examining the subsequent washing step . in general , we find that more detailed variants of our starting model of the hybridisation step , many of which have been independently suggested or alluded to previously , are unable to resolve the problem",
    ". given our previous analysis of data from the affymetrix latin square spike - in experiment @xcite , we are able to dismiss the sips isotherm and non - equilibrium models of hybridization including multi - step models which take into account a slow initiation step followed by a rapid zipping up .",
    "we are also able to dismiss the effects of electrostatic screening at the microarray surface and bulk target - target hybridization as a possible explanation of differential pm / mm intensity measurements at saturation .",
    "we are as yet unable to dismiss entirely the possibility that competitive hybridization from probe - probe duplexes at the microarray surface renders a fraction of dna probes unavailable to target molecules , as suggested by forman et al.@xcite . to make progress with this problem",
    ", one needs to carry out a numerical simulation of a dimer - like statistical mechanics model on a two dimensional random lattice , probably by monte carlo methods .",
    "analysis of the equivalent one dimensional model suggests that this form of competitive hybridization could well have a measurable quantitative effect on the equilibrium adsorption isotherm , though the two dimensional case is unlikely to lead to the observed hyperbolic response curve .    by comparison",
    ", we find that the post - hybridisation washing step is able to provide a promising and straightforward explanation for the pm / mm difference at saturation . we have considered a scenario in which the equilibrium state predicted by our starting hekstra / halperin model is attained by the end of the hybridization step , following which the washing phase dissociates a fraction of bound duplexes .",
    "the portion of both the pm and mm signals above background decays exponentially during the washing phase , but since the mm binding affinity is less than that for pm features , the decay rate is faster for mm features .",
    "the results of our analysis of the dependence of inferred washing rates on probe base sequences support this scenario .",
    "the advantages of this model are that it preserves the observed hyperbolic shape of the langmuir isotherm , and that it explains both the partial ( i.e. @xmath125 ) coverage of each feature by duplexes at saturation spike - in concentrations and the fact that the mm feature almost invariably asymptotes to a lower measured fluorescence intensity than its pm partner .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper argues that the solution to providing a practical method of estimating absolute concentration of target mrna from microarray data lies in understanding the physics of hybridization and washing at the microarray surface .",
