    "we simulated core convection and the adjacent radiative zone of 1.6 - 2 m@xmath2 stars using the 3-d spherical hydrodynamics code ash ( anelastic spherical harmonic , see @xcite ) . to generate initial conditions , we calculate 1-d models using the mesa evolution code ( @xcite ) and created a script to convert the mesa output for input to ash .",
    "the input profiles required include nuclear energy generation , thermal diffusivity , and convection boundaries .",
    "the ash simulations require iterations to gradually lower the viscosity and thermal diffusion to get core convection started .",
    "we added a radiative zone of several pressure scale heights ( 100 radial zones ) above the convective zone including the g - mode propagation region on top of the core .",
    "the simulations included 100 radial , 256 angular , and 512 azimuthal points .",
    "we have first results for gravity - mode excitation for 1.8 m@xmath2 models on the zero - age main sequence without and with ( slow ) rotation .",
    "we find that the convective core does excite a wide spectrum of g modes that couple to the radiative zone ( fig . [ ash ] ) , and that may be visible .",

    "deformation of the surface is calculated by assuming the surface is an equipotential with the value determined by the value at the equator .",
    "the surface in the remaining angular zones is determined to be the radial zone with the total potential closest to the equatorial value .",
    "defining the surface in this way allows the surface parameters to vary as a function of colatitude .",
    "the pulsations were calculated with a 2-d adiabatic pulsation code nro ( @xcite ) nro uses a 2-d finite difference grid to solve the pulsation equations , which allows us to calculate the pulsations for a 2-d stellar model .",

    "the models presented here use three zones ; previous work has shown that three zones are sufficient to calculate frequencies even for stars with relatively high rotation rates ( @xcite ) .",

    "the fitting algorithm finds the frequency that produces the lowest @xmath8 and assigns the observed frequency to that model frequency .",

    "once all the observed frequencies have been matched to a theoretical frequency , the code calculate a total @xmath8 for that model .",
    "the model with the lowest @xmath8 is considered to be the `` best '' model .",
    "the frequencies are made with a linear combination of three spherical harmonics , @xmath3 = 0 , 1 , and 2 .",
    "the categories are less meaningful as rotation rate increases , but the rotation rates are slow enough that the eigenfunctions should still look like @xmath3= 0 , 1 , and 2 modes .",

    "as the stars evolve , rotorc conserves angular momentum locally , so the surface rates drop .",
    "3-d stellarbox results : convective patterns in the envelope of stars more massive than the sun are quite different from solar conditions , and will be important to understand properties of solar - like oscillations and potentially stochastically excited acoustic modes in stars of 1 - 2 m@xmath2 .      rotorc / nro results : 2-d rotating stellar evolution and pulsation models show promise for future improved matches observed pulsation frequencies for asteroseismology of intermediate - mass rotating stars .",
