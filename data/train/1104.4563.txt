    "optimal stopping problems arise in various areas ranging from the classical sequential testing / change - point detection problems to applications in finance .",
    "although all formulations reduce to the problem of maximizing / minimizing the expected payoff over a set of stopping times , the solution methods are mostly problem - specific ; they depend significantly on the underlying process , payoff function and time - horizon .",
    "this paper pursues a common tool for the class of _ infinite - time horizon _ optimal stopping problems for _ spectrally negative lvy processes _ , or lvy processes with only negative jumps .    by extending the classical continuous diffusion model to the lvy model",
    ", one can achieve richer and more realistic models .",
    "in mathematical finance , the continuity of paths is empirically rejected and can not explain , for example , the volatility smile and non - zero credit spreads for short - maturity corporate bonds .",
    "these issues can often be alleviated by introducing jumps ; see , e.g.   @xcite .",
    "naturally , however , the optimal stopping problem becomes more challenging and can not enjoy a number of results obtained under the continuity of paths . in the case of one - dimensional continuous diffusion ,",
    "a full characterization of the value function is known and some practical methods have been developed ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "most of these results rely heavily on the continuity assumption ; once jumps are involved , only problem - specific approaches are currently available .    despite these differences",
    ", there exists a common tool known as the _ scale function _ for both continuous diffusion and spectrally negative lvy processes . the scale function for",
    "the former enables one to transform a problem of any arbitrary diffusion process to that of a standard brownian motion . for the latter ,",
    "the scale function has been playing a central role in expressing fluctuation identities for a general spectrally negative lvy process ( see @xcite ) . by taking advantage of the potential measure that can be expressed using the scale function",
    ", one can obtain the overshoot distribution at the first exit time , which is generally a big hurdle that typically makes the problem intractable .",
    "the objective of this paper is to pursue , with the help of the scale function , a common technique for the class of optimal stopping problems for spectrally negative lvy processes .",
    "focusing on the first time it down - crosses a fixed threshold , we express the corresponding expected payoff in terms of the scale function .",
    "this semi - explicit form enables us to differentiate and take limits thanks to the smoothness and asymptotic properties of the scale function as obtained , for example , in @xcite . by differentiating the expected payoff with respect to the threshold level , we obtain the _ first - order condition _ as well as the candidate optimal level that makes it vanish .",
    "we also obtain the _ continuous / smooth fit condition _ when the process is of bounded variation or when it contains a diffusion component .",
    "these conditions are in fact equivalent and can be obtained generally under mild conditions .",
    "the spectrally negative lvy model has been drawing much attention recently as a generalization of the classical black - scholes model in mathematical finance and also as a generalization of the cramr - lundberg model in insurance .",
    "a number of authors have succeeded in extending the classical results to the spectrally negative lvy model by way of scale functions .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for stochastic games , @xcite for the optimal dividend problem , @xcite for american and russian options , and @xcite for credit risk .",
    "in particular , egami and yamazaki @xcite modeled and obtained the optimal timing of capital reinforcement . as an application of the results obtained in this paper",
    ", we give a short proof of the mckean optimal stopping ( perpetual american put option ) problem with additional running rewards , as well as an extension and its analytical solution to @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : problem ] , we review the optimal stopping problem for spectrally negative lvy processes , and then express the expected value corresponding to the first down - crossing time in terms of the scale function",
    ". in section [ sec : fit ] , we obtain the first - order condition as well as the continuous / smooth fit condition and show their equivalence . in section [ section_extension ] ,",
