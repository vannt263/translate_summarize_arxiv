    "owadays the security of communication means not only secrecy but also concealment , so steganography is becoming more and more popular in the network communication .",
    "steganography is about how to send secret message covertly by embedding it into some innocuous cover - objects such as digital images , audios and videos . in this paper",
    "we take the image as example to describe our ideas .",
    "usually the process of embedding message will make some changes to the cover - images . to reduce the possibility of detection , the sender hopes to embed as most bits of message as possible by changing the least number of bits of images .",
    "this task can be accomplished through some encoding technique that is firstly brought up by crandall @xcite who call it matrix encoding . and",
    "in the present paper we generalize the idea of crandall and formally define this kind of codes as `` steganographic codes '' ( abbreviated stego - codes ) .",
    "besides increasing the embedding efficiency , stego - codes can also enhance the security of steganography at other aspects .",
    "now some detecting methods on steganography can not only detect the existence of the hidden message but also very accurately estimate its length @xcite .",
    "and there is even methods which can search for the stego - key @xcite .",
    "however , if there are a great many stego - codes that can be selected by the encoders as a part of the key , it will be very hard for the attacker to estimate the message length or recovery the stego - key .",
    "in fact , fridrich @xcite ever pointed out that matrix encoding is an effective measure against key search .",
    "lsb ( least significant bit ) steganography is the most popular image steganographic technique . by simple lsb steganography",
    "the encoder selects a pixel ( or dct coefficient ) every time and embeds one bit of message in its lsb by modifying methods such as replacing or @xmath2 .",
    "this traditional technique can be viewed as coding two bits of message per changed pixel because in random case 50% pixels need nt to be changed .",
    "a better method is described in the cpt scheme @xcite , which is a steganographic algorithm on binary image and can conceal as many as @xmath3 bits of data in a host image of size @xmath4 by changing at most 2 bits .",
    "another more effective example of stego - code is f5 @xcite , a lsb algorithm on jpeg image , which firstly implements crandall s matrix encoding and can embed @xmath3 bits of message in @xmath4 dct coefficients by changing at most one of them .    to construct more effective stego - codes and study their properties , in the present paper we define linear stego - codes over finite field with @xmath0 elements by using multi - outputs logic functions .",
    "firstly , as an example , a constructive method of linear stego - codes is proposed , which can generate the codes of f5 in a special case and is more agile than the codes of cpt . to study bounds on the length of linear stego - codes",
    ", we introduce the definition of @xmath1th dimension of vector space that converts the problems of linear stego - codes to pure algebraic problems .",
    "and then a bound on the length of linear stego - codes is obtained , from which we bring out the maximum length embeddable ( abbreviated mle ) codes .",
    "furthermore , it is shown that there is a 1 - 1 correspondence between linear mle codes and linear perfect error - correcting codes .    to study the nonlinear stego - code , another direct definition for stego - codes",
    "is presented , based on which we explain the relations and differences between stego - codes and error - correcting codes in geometrical language and generalize linear mle codes to nonlinear case .",
    "we prove the relations between mle codes and perfect codes with two constructive proofs which can be used to construct mle codes by perfect codes or construct perfect codes by mle codes .",
    "furthermore from the well - known results on perfect codes , the classification of all mle codes and a lower bound on the number of binary mle codes are obtained .",
    "usually a steganographic algorithm can be valued by both message rate and change density .",
    "large message rate and small change density means a good algorithm . to evaluate the performance of stego - codes more accurately ,",
    "we introduce the concept of hiding redundancy that can be viewed as a combination of message rate and change density .",
    "furthermore based on the result on hiding redundancy , another bound on the length of binary stego - codes is obtained .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",

    "in fact , the user hopes to get the maximum message rate within a proper constraint of `` change density '' , which is just the so called hiding capacity .",
    "therefore the difference between the hiding capacity and message rate , which we call as `` hiding redundancy '' in this paper , can reflects the capability of a stego - code soundly . to introduce the concept of hiding redundancy ,",

    "sequences of @xmath302 random variables are denoted with a superscript ( e.g. @xmath303 which takes its values on the product set @xmath304 ) .",
    "and we denote entropy and conditional entropy with @xmath305 and @xmath306 respectively .",
    "assume that the cover - objects @xmath307 are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d ) samples from @xmath308 . because the embedded message @xmath159 usually is cipher text",

    "a formal definition of steganographic system ( abbreviated stegosystem ) is present by moulin @xcite .",
    "first of all , the embedding algorithm of a stegosystem should keep transparency that can be guaranteed by some distortion constraint . a distortion function is a nonnegative function @xmath311 , which can be extended to one on @xmath302-tuples by @xmath312 .",
    "a length-@xmath302 stegosystem subject to distortion @xmath313 is a triple @xmath314 , where @xmath315 is the message set , @xmath316 is the embedding algorithm subject to the distortion constraint @xmath313 , and @xmath317 is the extracting algorithm .",
    "a cover channel is a conditional @xmath318 ( probability mass function ) @xmath319 .",
    "denote the set of cover channels subject to distortion @xmath313 by @xmath320 .",

    "the hiding capacity is the supremum of all achieve message rates of stegosystems subject to distortion @xmath313 under the condition of zero probability of error ( i.e. @xmath323 ) . when disregarding the active attacker",
    ", the results of @xcite imply that the expression of hiding capacity for stegosystem can be given by @xmath324    because @xmath325 is the maximum of the conditional entropy through all cover channels subject to @xmath313 , @xmath325 just reflects the hiding ability of the cover - object within the distortion constraint .",
    "so we refer to @xmath326 as the hiding redundancy of cover - objects , which can reflect the hiding capability of a stegosystem .",
    "we have assumed that the embedded message is uniformly distributed , and independent of @xmath307 , which means that there are uniformly distributed values at the positions to be changed . then an @xmath11 stego - coding function and a corresponding encoding algorithm can compose a stegosystem with message rate being @xmath327 . and when using hamming distance as distortion function , the average distortion is just the change density .",
