    "let @xmath2 be a real , primitive character modulo @xmath3 , and suppose furthermore that @xmath4 is a fundamental discriminant .",
    "let @xmath5 be a schwartz class test function .",
    "then the 1-level density for the zeros @xmath6 of @xmath7 should satisfy @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the cardinality of fundamental discriminants @xmath4 with @xmath10 .",
    "this is a theorem @xcite if the support of the fourier transform of @xmath11 is suitably restricted .",
    "recently conrey and snaith @xcite made a precise prediction for the lower order arithmetic terms in the 1-level density .",
    "their prediction is conditional , assuming the @xmath0-functions ratios conjecture @xcite .",
    "miller @xcite then proved ( under typical restrictions for the test function @xmath5 ) that these lower order terms exist and agree with the prediction in @xcite .",
    "zeros of dirichlet @xmath0-functions were first computed by davies and haselgrove , by spira , and by rumley .",
    "rubinstein , as one portion of his thesis @xcite , was the first to compute enough low lying zeros to meaningfully test ( [ eq:0 ] ) .",
    "however , the numerical methods developed in @xcite were optimized to compute @xmath12 for large real @xmath13 rather than large @xmath3 .",
    "the next section develops an algorithm to compute low lying zeros ( @xmath14 ) which is fast for large @xmath3 .",
    "this is a modification of the idea behind @xcite .",
    "the subsequent section has a discussion of the data from the computation of the zeros of approximately @xmath15 quadratic character @xmath0-functions for negative fundamental discriminants @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "this is followed by some implementation notes , and an appendix on miller s refined  1-level density and the @xmath0-functions ratios conjecture .",
    "thanks to mike rubinstein for sharing his data from @xcite , and david farmer for pointing me towards @xcite thanks to both steven j. miller and to the anonymous referee for their careful reading of the manuscript and numerous helpful suggestions .",
    "we are going to compute the @xmath0-function on the critical line by means of an approximate functional equation , an idea that goes back to lavrik and was first implemented by weinberger @xcite . with @xmath18 a real character modulo @xmath3 ,",
    "let @xmath19 , and with @xmath20 use @xmath21 to denote @xmath22 .",
    "define @xmath23 where @xmath24    as in @xcite , the tail of the series , the sum of terms @xmath25 , is bounded by @xmath26 , so if we want to compute to @xmath27 digits of accuracy , we should have @xmath28 certainly @xmath29 would suffice ; later we ll see we can do better given any particular @xmath3",
    ".    differentiating with respect to @xmath30 under the integral defining @xmath31 we see that @xmath32 while integration by parts , on the other hand , gives @xmath33 equations ( [ eq : diffintegral ] ) and ( [ eq : intbyparts ] ) give a nice recursive relation for all the derivatives @xmath34 in terms of @xmath31 .",
    "this , in turn , motivates a consideration of taylor expansions .",
    "suppose we compute @xmath31 by a taylor series expansion ( in the second variable , centered at @xmath35 ) to @xmath36 terms , where @xmath36 is a parameter to be determined .",
    "we can bound the remainder in the taylor expansion by a function @xmath37 ( defined below ) which satisfies @xmath38    we have @xmath39 since @xmath21 is in the critical strip . by the integral formula for the remainder in taylor s theorem",
    ", we can bound that remainder by @xmath40 or , in other words , @xmath41 this implies the first inequality . for the second ,",
    "we observe @xmath42    the first inequality is stronger , so it s good for the actual computation .",
    "the second is weaker , but simple enough to be useful in proving the theorem .",
    "now we re ready to put the taylor expansions to good use .",
    "similar to the method of @xcite , we partition the set @xmath43 into intervals @xmath44 for @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the @xmath47th fibonacci number .",
    "we then compute the function @xmath48 by a taylor expansion in the second variable , centered at @xmath49 , and truncated to @xmath36 terms : @xmath50 where @xmath51    we can compute @xmath52 as @xmath53 to @xmath27 digits of accuracy , where @xmath54 and @xmath36 are both @xmath55 , the implied constants depending on @xmath27 .",
    "the expression @xmath56 is a precomputation independent of @xmath21 in _ integers _ which is @xmath57 .",
    "subsequently , individual evaluations of @xmath52 cost only @xmath58 .",
    "of course , the outermost sum on @xmath59 and the innermost sum on @xmath60 in @xmath61 combine to give the squares of all @xmath62 ; the middle sum giving the needed taylor expansions .",
    "we need @xmath63 to be in the last interval @xmath64 , so @xmath65 with @xmath66 by ( [ eq : crude ] ) , this implies that @xmath67 suffices .",
    "this is all well and good , but we need to show that using taylor expansions at points spaced in what is essentially a geometric progression , does not require an unreasonable number of terms @xmath36 in each expansion in order to compute accurately .",
    "use @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and the rough estimate @xmath70 for the @xmath0-series truncation parameter @xmath71 .",
    "assuming the errors we make in computing each @xmath72 are independent with standard deviation @xmath73 , then the standard error in the sum ( [ eq:1 ] ) is bounded by @xcite @xmath74 where we approximated a sum by an integral .",
    "we want @xmath75 , or @xmath76 which will determine how many terms @xmath36 we need in each taylor expansion .",
    "we ll use the weaker inequality in the lemma with @xmath77 which makes the error @xmath78 thus we want @xmath79 and so @xmath80 suffices .    for a single function evaluation ( for example ,",
    "determining whether @xmath81 ) this algorithm is no improvement over @xcite ; summing the series requires @xmath82 terms by ( [ eq : crude ] ) . if one wants to do an arbitrarily large number of function evaluations , the improvement is spectacular : from exponential down to polynomial ( in terms of the number of digits of @xmath3 which is @xmath83 ) .",
    "this is deceptive , though , because what one really wants to do is find the all zeros with , say , @xmath84 .",
    "( larger @xmath13 intervals requires computing @xmath31 via the methods of @xcite which in turn necessitates re - doing the precomputation . )",
    "since there are @xmath55 such zeros and each can be found with @xmath85 evaluations , the precomputation still dominates as a theoretical result .",
