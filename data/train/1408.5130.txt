    "the systematic coverage of the northern sky yielded by the pan - starrs1 ( ps1 ) @xmath0 survey provides a spatially complete mapping of the regions around andromeda ( m31 ) , irrespective of the close proximity of the galactic plane .",
    "this has led to the discovery of three dwarf galaxies : cassiopeia  iii ( cas  iii or andromeda  xxxii ) , lacerta  i ( lac  i or andromeda  xxxi ; @xcite ) , and perseus  i ( per  i or andromeda  xxxiii ; @xcite ) , all reasonably bright ( @xmath13 ) and within @xmath14 of m31 . as they all three have m31-centric distances between 145 and @xmath15 , they are thought to be distant satellites of m31 . such distant dwarf galaxies would have a significant weight in constraining the mass of their host ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or even its proper motion @xcite .",
    "however , their usefulness in this endeavor depends on the confirmation that these three systems are indeed satellites of m31 .",
    "we have consequently embarked in a spectroscopic program to gather spectra of numerous stars in these systems with the deimos spectrograph on keck  ii .",
    "our goal is not only to determine the systemic velocity of the three dwarf galaxies to confirm that they are bound to m31 , but also to infer their internal dynamics , masses , and metallicities , and how these compare to the properties of other ( mainly closer ) m31 dwarf galaxies .    in this letter , we present the first results of our campaign and constrain the systemic velocities , velocity dispersions , and metallicities of the three dwarf galaxies .",
    "this work is structured as follows : section  2 presents the observations and data reduction , section  3 describes our analysis and results , and we discuss their implications in section  4 .",
    "the selection of targets for the deimos observations is based on the ps1 photometry for lac  i and cas  iii @xcite and a rederivation of the photometry from the ps1 images in the case of per  i @xcite .",
    "sources were selected to be compatible with red giant branch ( rgb ) stars from the three dwarf galaxies ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) and priorities were set to favor stars closer to the tip of the rgb for which the photometric uncertainties are smaller .",
    "we created 2 masks for lac  i , 4 for cas  iii , and 1 for per  i. the resulting targets for which we acquired good quality spectra are highlighted in the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) and spatial distributions of figure  [ cmd_sp ] , color - coded by the dwarf - galaxy - membership probability we calculate in the next section .",
    "the lac  i and cas  iii observations were conducted during the nights of august 2829 , 2013 , under good to exquisite conditions ( clear sky , seeing in the range @xmath18@xmath19 ) .",
    "each mask was observed for a total of 7200s , split into six 1200s subexposures .",
    "a realignment of the masks was performed after every subexposure to ensure that we could track the stability of a star s location inside its slit . moreover , once on target , we observed nearkrxe arc lamps before and after the acquisition of a mask to facilitate the wavelength calibration .",
    "the single per  i mask was acquired on the night of october 3 , 2013 since this galaxy was not yet discovered at the time of the other observations .",
    "this mask was observed for @xmath20s under reasonable seeing conditions ( @xmath21 ) , but with fleeting clouds .",
    "in addition , one of the two lac  i masks was also reobserved during this night to check the stability of the setup and data reduction over time .",
    "for all the observations , the instrumental set up covers the 56009800  wavelength range with the 1200 line / mm@xmath22 grating at a spectral resolution of @xmath23 / pixel .",
    "the lac  i and cas  iii spectra have typical signal - to - noise per pixel @xmath24 at @xmath25 and @xmath26 at @xmath27 . for the per  i mask with a shorter integration time ,",
    "@xmath28 .",
    "the spectra are extracted and reduced through a custom - built pipeline that follows the procedure described in @xcite and @xcite . in addition , the quality of our spectra is good enough that we can use the fraunhofer a band line in the range 75957630  to calculate small telluric corrections that stem from minute misalignments of the stars in the slits ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "heliocentric radial velocities , @xmath29 , are measured from the three strong lines of the calcium triplet at 8498 , 8542 , and 8662 .",
    "we only keep in our sample stars for which @xmath30 per pixel , the uncertainty on the velocity , @xmath31 , is smaller than @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "our observations include a sizable sample of 82 good - quality repeat measurements , which allows for a reliable determination of the uncertainty floor of our observations , @xmath34 , as defined in equation ( 1 ) of @xcite .",
    "this uncertainty floor is added in quadrature to the measured velocity uncertainties , which also include the uncertainty from the telluric correction .",
    "multiple observations of the same star are combined through the uncertainty - weighted average of their velocities before adding the uncertainty floor .",
    "a visual inspection of the spectra betrays the presence of a handful of carbon stars in both lac  i and cas  iii , identified from the characteristic `` serrated '' shape of their spectra .",
    "although the detailed study of these stars is beyond the scope of this laper , their presence could indicate that lac  i and cas  iii host intermediate age populations .",
    "these carbon stars were removed from the data sets studied in this letter .",
    "the top row of panels in figure  [ velocities ] summarizes the kinematic information on the three dwarf galaxies . in all cases ,",
    "the collapsed velocity histogram shows a clear detection of a dwarf galaxy s systemic velocity , well within expectations for m31 satellite dwarf galaxies ( @xmath35 ; @xcite ) and well separated from the foreground galactic contamination ( @xmath36 ) . in order to accurately derive the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of their systemic velocities and velocity dispersions",
    ", we determine the likelihood , given the data , of a family of models that is the sum of three gaussian functions in velocity ( one each for the milky way ( mw ) foreground contamination , the m31 halo contamination , and the dwarf galaxy ) .",
    "the likelihood of data point @xmath37 , @xmath38 , is defined as    @xmath39    with @xmath40 and @xmath41 the eight parameters of the model .",
    "these correspond , in this order , to the systemic velocity of the dwarf galaxy , its velocity dispersion , the fraction of stars in the mw foreground model , the systemic velocity of this mw model and its velocity dispersion , the fraction of stars in the m31 contamination model , the systemic velocity of this m31 model and its velocity dispersion .    with the use of flat priors within physical ranges for all parameters , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "] , we can directly calculate the probability of a model given the @xmath44 velocity measurements , @xmath45 , modulo a constant :    @xmath46    we use a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) scheme following a metropolis - hastings algorithm to explore the parameter space . finally , the integration of @xmath47 over the 6 mw and m31 nuisance parameters and either the dwarf galaxy s velocity dispersion or its systemic velocity yields the one - dimensional pdf of @xmath48 or @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "these are shown in the bottom row of panels in figure  [ velocities ] whereas the favored model , convolved with the typical velocity uncertainty ( @xmath50 ) , is represented over the velocity histograms by the red line in the top row of panels .",

    "the dashed lines correspond to the escape velocity for a @xmath52 point - mass m31 @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , the @xmath53-axis values have been multiplied by @xmath54 to account for the unknown transverse motion of the dwarf galaxies . ]",
    "all three dwarf galaxies have well measured systemic velocities has dropped to 61 percent of the peak value , i.e. @xmath55 deviations in the case of a gaussian pdf . ] with @xmath56 for lac  i , @xmath57 for cas  iii , and @xmath3 for per  i. these transform into the following galactic standard of rest velocities @xcite : @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , respectively . although the line of sight velocities at the large m31-distances of the three dwarf galaxies include part of the systemic proper motion of m31 , they are still mainly dominated by the m31 systemic radial velocity .",
    "the difference , @xmath61 , between @xmath62 and @xmath63 therefore informs us as to whether the dwarf galaxies are likely to be bound to m31 .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ d_vrm31 ] , all dwarf galaxies are likely bound to m31 despite their large m31-centric distances , under the assumption that they have reasonable proper motions .",
    "lac  i and per  i could potentially be beyond the escape velocity of m31 if we are to assume that our cosmic neighbor has a low mass ( @xmath64 ) , but this appears unrealistic given its large number of satellite dwarf galaxies , globular clusters , and stellar streams ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the high quality of the lac  i and cas  iii samples , with 126 and 212 member stars , respectively , also yields good constraints on their velocity dispersions , which we infer to be @xmath65 and @xmath66 . in the case of per  i ,",
    "the constraints on the velocity dispersion is much weaker since they rely on only 12 stars .",
    "the favored value is @xmath67 , but only models with @xmath68 can reasonably be rejected ( at the 90-percent confidence level ) .",
    "all the properties of the dwarf galaxies are summarized in table  [ properties ] .",
    "marginalizing over all models for a given dwarf galaxy , we also calculate the membership probability of every star in the sample for this dwarf galaxy . in all three cases",
    ", there is a clear separation between the contamination and the likely member stars , which all have very high membership probabilities .",
    "we use equation ( 11 ) of @xcite to infer an estimate of the dynamical masses of lac  i and cas  iii , folding in the uncertainties on the structural parameters ( sampling from the mcmc chain of @xcite ) , those on the distance modulus @xcite , and those on the velocity dispersion by sampling the mcmc chain calculated above .",
    "this yields @xmath69 and @xmath70 for lac  i and cas  iii , respectively , and @xmath7-band dynamical - mass - to - light ratios within the half - light radius of @xmath71 and @xmath9 in solar units values are mainly driven by the uncertainties on the luminosity of the systems . ] .",
    "in the case of lac  i and cas  iii , we measure the metallicity , @xmath72 , of each member star using the equivalent widths of the ca triplet lines .",
    "first , we determine the continuum for each star by fitting a b - spline to the wavelength region surrounding the triplet ( 84008700  ) .",
    "we then divide the spectrum by the continuum fit , resulting in a normalised spectrum from which we can measure the equivalent widths of the ca triplet by simultaneously fitting the continuum level using a polynomial and the 3 ca lines using 3 gaussian profiles .",
    "each line fit is then checked for contamination from nearby sky lines by comparing the ratios of their equivalent widths with the expectation from higher resolution studies of the ca triplet in rgb stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "contaminated lines are excluded from the determination of the final equivalent width for the triplet ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "finally , we use the @xcite relation to determine the value of @xmath72 for each star from this equivalent width measurement and its @xmath73-band absolute magnitude , converted from the ps1 photometry @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the metallicity yielded by stars observed on multiple masks implies that the uncertainties on these individual @xmath72 measurements are sizeable ( @xmath74 dex ) , preventing a measure of the metallicity spread .",
    "we can nevertheless use the large size of the samples to derive a precise median metallicity .",
    "these are derived from a monte carlo sampling of the individual metallicity values and their associated uncertainties , yielding @xmath10 and @xmath11 for lac  i and cas  iii , respectively .    in the case of the lower quality per  i data , we are limited to generating a single stacked spectrum of the 12 stars with a high membership probability .",
    "this spectrum yields the average metallicity @xmath75 for this system .",
    "_ left panel : _ the mass - size relation of lac  i and cas  iii ( blue squares ) compared to the other satellite dwarf galaxies of m31 ( white dots ) .",
    "the values for the half - light radius are preferentially taken from the set of homogeneous pandas measurements ( n. f. martin et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , completed by values taken from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",

    "the metallicity values are spectroscopic metallicity measurements taken from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the magnitudes are taken from the same references as the sizes . ]",
    "we have presented the first spectroscopic study of the three dwarf galaxies lac  i , cas  iii , and per  i , recently found in the ps1 @xmath0 survey .",
    "the systemic line - of - sight velocities of the three systems ( @xmath76 ; @xmath77 ; @xmath78 ) confirm that they are indeed bound satellites of m31 , except if they hold high tangential velocities ( figure  [ d_vrm31 ] ) . in the case of lac",
    "i and cas  iii , we obtain good constraints on their velocity dispersions , which we infer to be @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "combined with the known size of these two dwarf galaxies , these yield dynamical masses of @xmath79 and @xmath80 . in the case of per  i , we infer a favored velocity dispersion of only @xmath81 , but the data is of too - low quality to confidently reject velocity dispersions below @xmath32 at the 90-percent confidence level . finally ,",
    "we determine the average metallicity of the three dwarf galaxies ; all three are metal - poor systems with @xmath82 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "all the properties we derive for the three dwarf galaxies are typical of other m31 ( or local group ) satellite galaxies , as we exemplify in figure  [ comparison ] in which we compare the dwarf galaxies with the other andromeda dwarf galaxies in the context of the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* left panel ) size - mass relation , and the luminosity - metallicity relation of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* right panel ) . the only point of mild tension comes from the metallicity of the dwarf galaxies ; these are on the low side of expectations .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that the luminosity - metallicity relation was determined from a combination of mw dwarf spheroidal galaxies and local group dwarf irregular galaxies ( equation ( 3 ) of @xcite ) and may not faithfully represent m31 satellites .",
    "it should also be noted that the metallicity of many of the m31 satellites are rather uncertain as they are usually measured from only a handful of stars .",
    "overall , these do not significantly differ from our @xmath72 measurements for cas  iii and per  i. lac  i appears more metal - poor than expected , but this could also be due to an overestimation of its ( uncertain ) luminosity .",
    "confirmation of its departure from the luminosity - metallicity relation will have to be confirmed with deeper photometry than accessible by the ps1 survey .    while the left panel of figure  [ comparison ] focusses on the comparison of the size and mass of the dwarf galaxies with dark - matter dominated models , it is interesting to note that the velocity dispersion values we measure are in agreement with the mond - ian predictions calculated by @xcite .",
    "the favored low velocity dispersion we infer for per  i , albeit with large uncertainties , is also in agreement with similar predictions by @xcite .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that , although cas  iii overlaps with the thin rotating disk of andromeda dwarf galaxies @xcite , its velocity indicates that it is moving counter to the global motion of that structure .",
