    "in recent experiments , the flux of electrons through a quantum point contact ( qpc ) and into the bulk of a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) was probed with a charged atomic force microscope ( afm ) tip @xcite .",
    "the tip , capacitively coupled to the 2deg , created a movable scatterer of the electrons propagating through the system @xcite .",
    "the measurements taken were of the conductance as a function of the position of the afm tip above the sample .",
    "in the measurements , fringes spaced at half of the fermi wavelength and oriented transverse to the electron flux were seen .",
    "close to the qpc , we can understand these interference fringes as arising from an open fabry - prot cavity between the tip and the qpc . however , simple kinematic considerations suggest that these fringes should die out at some distance from the qpc , as waves that differ in energy drift out of phase with one another . in the experimental system , for example , waves differing in energy by @xmath0 drift out of phase by one radian over a round - trip distance of approximately 1300  nm .",
    "the fringes seen experimentally , however , survive well beyond this range .",
    "the interference fringes beyond this thermal length are seen in full quantum - mechanical simulations with thermal averaging , as shown in fig .",
    "[ patchfig ] , so we know that a complete theory reproduces them .",
    "this solution , however , does nt tell us much about the mechanism that allows the fringes to survive .",
    "we present here a simple model , appealing only to first - order scattering , that shows that the fringes should survive up to the phase coherence length .",
    "another mechanism for qualitatively different fringes _ beyond _ the coherence length is also presented ; to date , experiments have not probed this regime .",
    "the potential seen by electrons in a 2deg is fundamental to the model presented here . as reported in @xcite ,",
    "we have considered two contributions to this potential : impurities and donor atom density fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the donor atoms results in a random potential whose peaks lie well below the energy of the electrons , and thus are not expected to backscatter significantly .",
    "the impurities , on the other hand , are occasionally located close to the 2deg and thus produce strong , localized scattering centers . it is these impurity scatterers that we will consider in our models below .",
    "here we use a simple , first - order model to explain the fringes seen beyond the thermal length .",
    "the result requires phase coherent transport at each energy , and therefore does not apply beyond the phase coherence length .",
    "this mechanism was previously mentioned in @xcite , without the necessary details presented here , to establish priority .",
    "the thermal average is found by an integral over energy with the derivative of the fermi function as a weighting function . in order to simplify the mathematics of this model ,",
    "we seek an approximation that is an integral over wave vector with gaussian weighting . for the ranges of parameters in this system",
    ", such an approximation can be made to an acceptable degree of accuracy .",
    "typical values taken from the experiments , for example , give us a temperature of 1.7  k and a fermi energy of 16  mev .",
    "the thermal distribution of energies begins with the derivative of the fermi function at the known temperature @xmath1 and fermi energy @xmath2 .",
    "we find that @xmath3^{-2 } \\frac{1}{kt } e^{(e - e_f)/kt } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\approx & \\frac{1}{4kt } e^{-[(e - e_f)/(4kt \\pi^{-1/2})]^2 } \\label{weight1eq } \\\\ & \\approx & \\frac{1}{4kt } e^{-(k - k_0)^2 \\ell_t^2}. \\label{weight2eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the standard deviation of the gaussian in eq .",
    "( [ weight1eq ] ) was chosen to match both the value of @xmath4 at @xmath5 and its approximate width ; we can do both while preserving normalization . in eq .",
    "( [ weight2eq ] ) we have defined our kinematic thermal length @xmath6 as @xmath7 this is half the distance ( since we are interested in round - trips ) that it takes two waves separated in energy by the standard deviation of the gaussian in eq .",
    "( [ weight1eq ] ) to drift one radian out of phase .",
    "this then is the weighting function that we will use in performing the thermal average .    using eq .",
    "( [ weight2eq ] ) we will integrate over @xmath8 rather than @xmath9 in taking the thermal average . given the dispersion relation @xmath10 , we have @xmath11 . appealing to the physical values that will appear for @xmath12 and @xmath6 , over the range of the weighting function",
    "we can approximate this dispersion relation as linear and take @xmath13 .",
    "hence for a signal @xmath14 at fixed wave vector , we have the thermally averaged signal @xmath15 given by @xmath16      this model is quite simple .",
    "we take a random distribution of s - wave scatterers in a plane at the points @xmath17 and with scattering lengths @xmath18 .",
    "we assume phase coherent transport over the round - trip distances .",
    "furthermore , we make the following approximations , which have no effect on the qualitative results and little effect on the quantitative results : we use @xmath19 rather than bessel functions for the two - dimensional s - waves , assume for each scatterer a scattering amplitude proportional to the scattering length , and assume a phase shift equal to the scattering length times the wave number . the quantity of interest is the reduction of flux through the point contact as a result of the scattering .    we take the qpc to have at least one channel open , and in the single - scattering picture neglect backscattering from the point contact .",
    "any conductance oscillations are then not due to interference of the returning amplitude with the outgoing amplitude , but rather result from interference of different ways of returning to the qpc .",
    "this is easily seen by considering an outgoing wave @xmath20 $ ] added to a backscattered wave @xmath21 $ ] in the wire , where @xmath22 is the phase shift due to a backscattering obstruction at position @xmath23 .",
    "it is readily seen that the net flux is independent of @xmath24 , meaning one source of backscattering does not give fringes in conductance measurements .",
    "let the wave from the qpc be @xmath19 , and the scattered wave from a point scatterer , measured at the qpc , be @xmath25 .",
    "the constant of proportionality between the scattering length and amplitude , @xmath26 , depends on details of the scattering potentials irrelevant to this model .",
    "there are two factors of @xmath27 , one for the falloff of the wave illuminating the scatterer and one for the falloff of the scattered wave .",
    "the phase advances by the round - trip distance plus the phase shift .",
    "let the tip be at a radius @xmath28 and have the scattering length @xmath29 , giving a similar return wave .",
    "finally , to simplify the notation , let @xmath30 .",
    "the full return wave at a single energy is @xmath31 the absolute square of this wave , the interference of various return paths , is the signal we require .",
    "we concentrate on the cross terms , which will give rise to the oscillations with @xmath28 .",
    "the cross terms are @xmath32 .",

    ", there is nothing special about the condition @xmath35 .",
    "the thermal length still plays a role in that it determines the width of the band around @xmath36 that contributes to the thermally averaged signal .",
    "note that the fringes predicted by this model are at half the fermi wavelength , as observed .",
    "furthermore , the fringes will be oriented perpendicular to the direction of electron flow , also as observed .    in fig",
    ".  [ bornfig ] we show some examples of @xmath37 . to make the signal easier to observe , we divide out the overall @xmath38 dependence of the signal strength .",
    "( [ signal1eq ] ) shows a clear @xmath39 dependence , but has an additional , not so obvious factor of @xmath40 .",
    "this additional factor is related to the radial dependence of the number of scatterers in our @xmath6-wide band and the expectation value of a random sum of cosines .",
    "a )    b )    there are other coherence effects that survive thermal averaging , such as weak localization , where the interference of time - reversed paths leads to an increased backscattering rate @xcite . in contrast , the single - scattering effect discussed here originates from the interference of distinct paths of similar length , which can either increase or suppress backscattering .    the derivation above assumed infinite coherence length ; however , it is clear that this mechanism can not operate past this length , since it depends on interference of coherent backscattered amplitude .",
    "the appearance ( or disappearance ) of these backscattering fringes can become a new experimental measure of the coherence length .",
    "if we change the sum in eq .",
    "( [ signal1eq ] ) to an integral over the plane and let @xmath41 , we go from a system of discrete scattering centers to a continuum approximation with constant density .",

    "the dominant term for the magnitude of this signal is the exponential @xmath43 . for the values applicable in the physical systems that we have considered ,",
    "this is vanishingly small ; in this continuum limit , the signal disappears .",
    "this implicit assumption of completely regular scatterer distribution is nt particularly justified , however .",
    "we already know from multiple scattering theory that such a regular distribution can appear as simply a mean field , effectively `` raising the floor '' of the potential over which the electrons propagate .    even without this concern , this continuum limit calculation also tells us nothing about how that limit is approached . simply taking the single - scattering model in eq .",
    "( [ signal1eq ] ) and increasing the density @xmath44 of scatterers ( without any correlation in their placement ) reveals a @xmath45 dependence of the signal strength . clearly , however , at some density the single - scattering model ceases to be a useful one .",
    "a detailed study of how the infinite - order scattering calculations will cross over between domains is yet to be performed .",
    "the predictions of this model do hold , however , for infinite order scattering calculations with scatterer densities comparable to the experimental system .",
    "preliminary results ( kalben et al . ) indicate that the fringes are qualitatively similar even as multiple scattering becomes important .",
    "just as simple kinematic considerations would lead one astray about the importance of the thermal length @xmath6 , so can one overestimate the importance of the phase coherence length @xmath46 .",
    "though the model described above depends on phase coherent transport , a resonance model predicts fringes of a qualitatively different nature at distances greater than @xmath46 .    if the distance between the afm tip and another scatterer is less than @xmath6 and @xmath46 , there can exist a resonance between the two .",
    "this resonance can increase or decrease the conductance through the full system despite incoherent transport over the distance back to the qpc .",
    "we are , in fact , quite accustomed to current carrying the signatures of resonance over great distances of incoherent transport , as this is the situation whenever we connect equipment to a 2deg with room - temperature wires .",
    "this result is relatively easy to demonstrate in one dimension , using the transfer matrix formalism with dephasing built in .",
    "the fringes generated by this resonance mechanism would not be centered on the qpc , but rather on the fixed scatterer participating in the resonance .",
    "this is the primary qualitative difference between this model and the single - scattering model proposed above . in",
    "the parameter ranges relevant to recent experiments ( i.e. , scatterer densities and tip ranges ) we expect the single scattering mechanism to dominate ."
