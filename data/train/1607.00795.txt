    "yang  baxter deformations provide a systematic way to study integrable deformations of non - linear sigma models in two dimensions .",
    "this method was invented by klimcik for principal chiral models based on the modified classical yang ",
    "baxter equation ( mcybe )  @xcite .",
    "it was generalized to the symmetric coset case in  @xcite and the homogeneous cybe case in  @xcite .",
    "it is very interesting to consider some applications of yang ",
    "baxter deformations in the context of the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite .",
    "the green - schwarz action of type iib superstring on @xmath0 was constructed by metsaev and tseytlin in terms of the supercoset  @xcite @xmath4 this supercoset has a @xmath5-grading , generalizing the @xmath6-grading of the symmetric cosets .",
    "hence the @xmath0 superstring exhibits classical integrability in the sense of kinematic integrability  @xcite ( for nice reviews , see  @xcite ) .",
    "the first application of yang  baxter deformation to the @xmath0 superstring was carried out by delduc , magro and vicedo  @xcite .",
    "the classical action was constructed with a classical @xmath1-matrix of drinfeld - jimbo type  @xcite and the associated symmetry algebra is a @xmath7-deformation of @xmath8 .",
    "this specific example is often called @xmath9-deformation .",
    "the metric and ns - ns two - form were subsequently computed by performing a coset construction for the bosonic element  @xcite .",
    "after that , some works were done towards constructing the full background by directly solving the equations of motion of type iib supergravity  @xcite .",
    "this strategy was preferred simply because of the technical difficulty of the supercoset construction . in the end ,",
    "arutyunov , borsato and frolov accomplished doing the supercoset construction and the full background was determined  @xcite ( for a good review , see  @xcite ) .",
    "a remarkable point is that the resulting background does not satisfy the equations of motion of type iib supergravity .",
    "however , the situation is not hopeless .",
    "the ten - dimensional background is related to the full solution of the usual type iib supergravity via t - dualities up to the linear dependence of the dilaton  @xcite .",
    "the world - sheet theory is not weyl invariant but still scale invariant , _",
    "i.e. _ , the world - sheet beta function does not vanish but is given by a total derivative . from the viewpoint of the spacetime , this result indicates that the on - shell condition of type iib supergravity is weakened to a generalized set of the equations .",
    "in fact , the generalized equations of type iib supergravity were proposed in  @xcite and the background obtained in  @xcite is a solution of the generalized equations . for a more general argument on the relation between the @xmath10-symmetry of the @xmath9-deformed @xmath0 superstring and the generalized equations , see  @xcite .",
    "other examples of yang  baxter deformations of the @xmath0 superstring are based on the homogeneous cybe  @xcite . in comparison to the mcybe case ,",
    "there are some advantages .",
    "one of them is that one can perform partial deformations of @xmath0 , i.e. , only ads@xmath11 or only @xmath12 can be deformed .",
    "this class of yang ",
    "baxter deformations includes well - known examples such as gravity duals of non - commutative gauge theories  @xcite , the gamma - deformations of @xmath12  @xcite , and schrdinger spacetimes  @xcite . in a series of works  @xcite ,",
    "the associated classical @xmath1-matrices were identified with these backgrounds , flat spacetime and pp - wave , see  @xcite . for short summaries ,",
    "see  @xcite . ] . in a remarkable advance",
    ", the supercoset construction has been performed in  @xcite and now the full background can be obtained for arbitrary classical @xmath1-matrices . for abelian classical @xmath1-matrices ,",
    "the r - r sector and dilaton have been confirmed for well - known backgrounds and it seems likely that yang ",
    "baxter deformations work well  @xcite .",
    "however , for non - abelian classical @xmath1-matrices , the associated backgrounds do not in general satisfy the equations of motion of type iib supergravity  @xcite .",
    "an interesting question here is whether deformed backgrounds for non - abelian classical @xmath1-matrices satisfy the generalized equations of motion or not .",
    "this question can be answered if the deformed string theory is supposed to be the canonical action of the green - schwarz string @xcite .",
    "this assumption however has to be confirmed by a separate analysis and it is still an open problem .",
    "a confirmation was also given in  @xcite based on scaling limits of the @xmath9-deformed ads@xmath13 .",
    "it may also be intriguing to study `` t - dualized '' backgrounds related to non - abelian classical @xmath1-matrices and consider their physical interpretation .",
    "we use quotation marks for t - dualities involving solutions to the generalized sugra equations , where the usual buscher rules have to be supplemented with a prescription for the behavior of the dilaton @xcite .    in this paper , we consider yang ",
    "baxter deformations of the @xmath0 superstring with the homogeneous cybe and focus on some examples of non - abelian classical @xmath1-matrix .",
    "we derive the associated backgrounds explicitly and show that all of the resulting backgrounds satisfy the generalized equations . for some of them ,",
    "`` t - dualized '' backgrounds are derived by adding a linear coordinate dependence to the dilaton and these satisfy the usual type iib supergravity equations .",
    "remarkably , some of the `` t - dualized ''",
    "backgrounds are locally t - dual to the undeformed @xmath0 via appropriate coordinate transformations , though it does not seem that this is always the case .",
    "at least in cases where the undeformed @xmath0 background can be reproduced , the classical integrability of the `` t - dualized '' background is manifest .",

    "one of the main problems in the study of integrable deformations is to determine if the corresponding ten - dimensional field content can be understood as a string theory background .    in the case of the @xmath9-deformation",
    ", the ten - dimensional background can be obtained via the supercoset construction outlined above and one can see that the fields _ do not satisfy _ the type iib equations of motion  @xcite .",
    "in fact , as was shown in  @xcite , the worldsheet theory is _ not weyl invariant _ , but only scale invariant : the corresponding beta function does not vanish but is a total derivative .",
    "this fact weakens the usual on - shell construction of type iib supergravity and has lead to the definition of _ generalized _ type iib equations  @xcite .",

    "* the fourth , fifth and sixth equations ( [ general4 ] ) , ( [ general5 ] ) and ( [ general6 ] ) are for the r - r one - form , three - form and five - form field strengths .",
    "the bianchi identities for the r - r field strengths are also generalized as @xmath71    together with the standard type iib fields , the equations ( [ general1])-([general6 ] ) involve the three new vector fields @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "let us consider them in detail .",
    "in fact , only two of them are independent as the vector @xmath72 is expressed as @xmath75 @xmath73 and @xmath74 satisfy the following relations : @xmath76 the first equation of ( [ iz ] ) is the killing vector equation . assuming that @xmath77 is chosen such that the lie derivative vanishes , @xmath78 the second equation of ( [ iz ] ) can be solved by @xmath79 thus @xmath74 can be regarded as a generalization of the dilaton gradient @xmath80 . in particular ,",
    "when @xmath73 vanishes , @xmath81 becomes @xmath80 and the generalized equations ( [ general1])-([general6 ] ) are reduced to the usual type iib supergravity equations .    as mentioned at the beginning of this section , the generalized equations ( [ general1])-([general6 ] ) were found in the study of the @xmath9-deformed @xmath0 superstring .",
