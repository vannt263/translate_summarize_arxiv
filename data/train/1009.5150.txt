    "a radio counterpart has been identified in vla observations by @xcite .",
    "the emission appeared to be persistent and was non - thermal .",
    "a pair of symmetric radio features were later found associated with the source ( core ) in vlba observations by @xcite , which were interpreted as emission from two opposite relativistic jets .",
    "the system was also identified with a very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath0-ray source found in the _ cgro_/egret ( paredes et al .",
    "2000 ) and hess @xcite surveys .",
    "the detection of mev - gev / tev emission placed ls  5039/rx  j1826.2@xmath61450 into a class of unusual high - energy objects , the @xmath0-ray binaries .",
    "so far , only a handful of @xmath0-ray binaries are known .",
    "the others are psr b1259@xmath663 @xcite , ls i + 61 303 @xcite , cygnus x-1 @xcite , cygnus x-3 @xcite , and the recent candidate hess  j0632 + 057 @xcite .    ls  5039/rx  j1826.2@xmath61450 ( hereafter , referred to as ls  5039 ) has been classified as a high - mass x - ray binary in the catalogue compiled by @xcite .",
    "the distance to the source is @xmath7kpc @xcite .",
    "its primary is a bright ( @xmath8 ) massive o star @xcite , and its secondary is a compact star .",
    "it is still a matter of debate whether the compact star in ls  5039 is a black hole or a neutron star .",
    "uv and optical spectroscopy established that the primary is a o6.5v((f ) ) star @xcite . the presence of p  cygni profiles in the uv",

    "they argued that the mass of the primary o star is in the range @xmath19m@xmath11 , and the compact secondary is a neutron star which has a mass @xmath20m@xmath11 .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter c05 ) conducted a comprehensive analysis of the optical h balmer and hei and heii lines and obtained @xmath21d , @xmath22 , @xmath23m@xmath11 and @xmath24r@xmath11 .",
    "they derived that the orbital inclination @xmath25 , the primary o star has a mass @xmath26m@xmath11 and the compact star has a mass @xmath27m@xmath11 . the orbital period obtained by c05 is shorter than that obtained by m04 .",

    "their refined orbital parameters are @xmath28d , @xmath29 , @xmath30m@xmath11 and @xmath31r@xmath11 .",
    "one major question about ls  5039 is the nature of the compact object .",
    "* the orbital parameters derived by c05 clearly indicate that the compact star has a mass exceeding 3.0  m@xmath11 , the usually accepted upper limit of masses of neutron stars @xcite , implying that ls  5039 is a candidate black - hole high - mass x - ray binary . *",
    "black - hole binaries with a massive o - type donor star are very rare , partly because of the extremely short life - spans of such systems . to date , cyg x-1 is the only known black - hole x - ray binary in the milky way with a massive o donor star .",
    "the presence of a black hole * or not * in ls  5039 * would therefore have * significant implications not only on the formation of black - hole high - mass x - ray binaries and the population of such systems in the milky way , but also on how very high - energy ( tev ) emission is produced in @xmath0-ray binaries ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the issue of the nature of the compact star associated with ls  5039 is far from being settled .",
    "* while the spectroscopic observations of c05 favor the black - hole scenario , some workers have argued for a neutron - star scenario involving a non - accreting young pulsar @xcite .",
    "* observationally , @xcite found that changes in the _ mas _ morphology of the radio images were difficult to reconcile with the micro - quasar ( black - hole binary ) scenario in which the radio emission originates from expanding plasmons .",
    "the situation is further complicated by the fact that the temporal and spectral behaviour of the x - ray emission @xcite and properties of the tev emission @xcite indicate that the high - energy radiation might originate from regions far outside the binary orbit of ls  5039 .",
    "we have been observing ls  5039 photometrically with ground - based telescopes at optical and near ir wavelengths to search for orbital modulation , but orbital variations have not been detected in those data ( to be reported elsewhere ) . however , we have detected variations at the 20 mmag level , especially in the @xmath32-band .",
    "this prompted us to take a closer look at the optical photometric variations of ls  5039 from space with the canadian microvariability and oscillations of stars ( _ most _  ) satellite .",
    "our _ most _ observations were made in july 2009 , simultaneously with ground - based optical spectroscopic observations from the australian national university ( anu ) 2.3 m telescope at siding spring observatory , australia .",
    "here we report on the main findings , especially those concerning the masses of the component stars in ls  5039 and the nature of the compact star .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ two ]",
    "we describe the photometric observations with the _ most _ space telescope and the spectroscopic observations with the anu 2.3 m telescope , which were made simultaneously . in section",
    "[ three ] we describe the data analysis , present the results on the system s orbital and other parameters , and discuss the implications of the nature of the compact object and the properties of the wind / outflow from the primary star .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in section [ four ] .",
    "the _ most _ microsatellite @xcite houses a 15-cm rumak - maksutov telescope feeding a ccd photometer through a custom optical broadband ( 350  750 nm ) filter . from its polar sun - synchronous orbit ( altitude = 820 km ; orbital period = 101 min )",
    ", it has a continuous viewing zone ( cvz ) about @xmath33 wide within which it can monitor target fields for up to 2 months without interruption .",
    "targets brighter than v @xmath2 6 are observed in fabry imaging mode ; fainter targets ( like ls 5039 ) are observed in direct imaging mode , similar to standard ccd photometry with a ground - based instrument .",
    "the photometry is non - differential , but given the orbit , thermal and design characteristics of _ most _ , experience has shown that it is a very photometrically stable platform even over long timescales ( with repeatability of the mean instrumental flux from a non - variable target of the brightness of ls 5039 to within about 1 mmag ) .",
    "the science exposures on the _ most _ science ccd take place at the same time as the guide star exposures for satellite pointing . in the case of the ls",
    "5039 observations , the guide star exposure time ( and hence the science target exposure time ) was 3.03 s. to build up signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , the science exposures were co - added on board the satellite in ` stacks ' of 10 exposures . stacks ( each 30.3 s of total integration ) were downloaded from the satellite consecutively ( with no dead time between stacks ) , giving a sampling rate of about twice per minute .",
    "the ls 5039 field lies outside the _ most _ cvz so it could not be monitored continuously .",
    "this field alternated with another _ most _ primary science target field ( the wolf - rayet star wr 113 ) during each _ most _ satellite orbit .",
    "typically , we monitored ls 5039 for about @xmath34 of every second _ most _ orbit ( or about 70 of every second interval of 101 min ) between 2009 july 7  23 .    due to the observing season and the location of the ls 5039 field relative to the illuminated limb of the earth , scattered earthshine was high during the beginning and end of each ` visit ' to the ls 5039 field .",
    "we truncated about 15  20 min of each orbit from the original data to preserve the highest photometric precision .",
    "we also filtered outliers caused by cosmic ray hits , especially during passages of the satellite through the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) .",
    "however , the resulting light curve has an effective duty cycle of about 50% ( with gaps at intervals of about 101 min ) and it still sampled the important timescales in the ls 5039 system thoroughly .",
    "the spectroscopic observations were carried out on four nights between 2009 july 8  11 ( during the _ most _ observations ) and on three nights between august 1  3 , using the anu 2.3 m telescope with an echelle spectrograph . in total",
    ", 118 spectra were obtained that cover almost 40 hours with nearly uniform sampling of the whole orbit .",
    "the integration times were between 900  1200 s and the spectra covered the whole visual range between 3900   and 6720  .",
    "the nominal spectral resolving power was @xmath35 23,000 at the h@xmath12 line , with a typical snr per extracted pixel of about 100 for combined spectra that represented one - hour integrations .",
    "all data were reduced with standard iraf tasks , including bias and flat - field corrections , cosmic ray removal , extraction of the 27 individual orders of the echelle spectra , wavelength calibration , and continuum normalization .",
    "thar spectral lamp exposures were regularly taken before and after every object spectrum to monitor the wavelength shifts of the ccd spectra .",

    "models of the wind flow in the system will need to take that focusing into account , especially those that model a pulsar wind / stellar wind interaction .",
    "* we carried out a simple correlation analysis between these ew changes and the _ most _ light curve * ( rebinned to the ew bin size ) * , and found the correlation coefficients , @xmath75 , to be 0.52 , 0.70 and 0.52 for the h@xmath12 , h@xmath44 and he    i    @xmath95875 lines , respectively .",
    "this result suggests the possibility of real modulations over the orbital period , but further studies are necessary .",
    "note that our data only show smooth orbital modulation in the h@xmath12 , h@xmath76 and he i absorption lines and in the emission components of the h balmer lines .",
    "the lines do not show evidence of dense clump - like condensates in the stellar wind .",
    "the two main findings from our work are that the orbit has a significantly lower eccentricity than previously thought and that the * total mass of the system is toward the higher end of previous estimates , when the variability of the _ most _ data is considered .",
    "we were not able to resolve the nature of the compact object , between neutron star and black hole , in spite of simulations by c05 that postulated that a low amplitude light curve would be associated with a low inclination and a black hole . *",
    "the eccentricity @xmath77 obtained by m04 put ls  5039 as the system with the most eccentric orbit among x - ray binaries with an o donor star .",
    "although the value was later shown to be lower ( @xmath78 , c05 and a09 ) , the eccentricity would still be high enough to have some consequences on the dynamical and radiative properties , and on the evolutionary history , of the system . *",
    "the observed tev spectrum is consistent with inverse compton scattering from electrons distant from the compact object either in a pulsar wind / stellar wind shock if the compact object is a neutron star , or in a jet if the compact object is a black hole .",
    "the lack of accretion features in the x - ray spectrum favors the pulsar model unless the bulk of the accretion power is released as kinetic energy in jet outflow instead of thermally from an accretion disk @xcite . in either case",
    "the kev x - rays are hypothesised to originate as synchrotron emission from the electrons responsible for the inverse compton tev emission .",
    "this is in contrast to the canonical view of x - ray emission from x - ray binaries .",
    "* in the canonical view , the kev x - rays from x - ray binaries with an o star are powered by the accretion of gas either in a wind focused by the roche - lobe of the donor star or captured directly from the wind out - flowing from the donor star . in the focused wind scenario , an accretion disk is expected to form around the compact star , similar to that in systems with roche - lobe filling mass - transfer , as the accreting gas carries substantial specific angular momentum",
    ". in the direct wind capture scenario , provided that the specific angular momentum of the gas is sufficiently small , an extensive accretion disk might not be formed and the accretion inflow would be practically radial and resemble that of a bondi - hoyle flow .",
    "a * lower orbital * eccentricity would give a lower specific angular momentum in the wind material that is swept up by the accreting star .",
    "so far observations [ e.g. x - ray observations by _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _",
    "@xcite ] have not shown evidence of an accretion disk in ls  5039 .",
    "if ls  5039 has an extremely high orbital eccentricity as originally measured , the lack of an accretion disk around its compact star would need certain non - trivial explanations ( cf . the situation in the be x - ray binaries ) .",
    "the lower eccentricity may ease the situation somewhat , allowing radial gas inflow for a substantial distance before reaching the compact accretor . then",
    ", if there is an accretion disk , it would not be expected to be a large and dense disk because such a disk would generate significant thermal soft kev x - rays , which are not detected in the _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ and other x - ray observations .",
    "our smaller value of eccentricity reduces the discrepancy between the low observed x - ray variability and what would be expected from wind accretion with bondi - hoyle like radial inflow [ @xcite , @xcite , c05 ] .",
    "known black - hole high - mass x - ray binaries tend to have small orbital eccentricity , unlike the x - ray pulsars ( see @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray binaries with a black hole and an o donor star are very rare , and cyg x-1 is the currently only known system in the milky way .",
    "the confirmation of ls  5039 as a black - hole high - mass x - ray binary in which a massive o donor star and a black hole revolve around each other in an eccentric orbit * would have * important implications on how such systems are formed and how massive binaries evolve . in ls  5039 , the compact star s progenitor , at a certain stage ,",
    "should be more massive than the current o donor star , otherwise it would not have evolved to form the compact star .",
    "o stars have very short life spans ( @xmath2 a few myr ) , thus ls  5039 as * an x - ray binary * must be younger than a few million years .",
    "this is supported by the fact that ls  5039 has a highly eccentric binary orbit , which has yet to be * circularized * from a presumed recent supernova event .",
    "however , it is unclear whether the progenitor of the o star or the progenitor of the compact star had the larger initial mass , * as a rapid * evolution of the progenitor of the compact star could well be triggered by a mass transfer process , in which the system was compact enough to allow the progenitor of the current o star to overfill its roche - lobe and transfer material to the progenitor of the compact star .",
    "( for more on the evolution of very massive binaries , see e.g. @xcite . )",
    "if ls  5039 was indeed formed through this mass - transfer channel , * a finding that it contains a black hole * among the fewer than 200 known high - mass x - ray binaries in the milky way would imply that a black - hole high - mass x - ray might be formed in close massive binaries more easily than previously thought .",
    "young stellar clusters in star - forming galaxies may well be populated by ls  5039-type sources and are potentially gev - tev @xmath0-ray sources .",
    "our simultaneous optical photometry from the _ most _ space telescope and high resolution echelle optical spectroscopy from the anu 2.3 m telescope have put * further * constraints on the orbital parameters of the ls  5039 system .",
    "in particular we obtained a mass function @xmath79 m@xmath3 and an orbital eccentricity @xmath80 .",
    "the maximum photometric variation of ls 5039 in the _ most _ light curve was 2 mmag . *",
    "the low photometric variation is consistent with the lower orbital eccentricity of 0.24 , as opposed to the value of 0.35 found by others , and it is consistent with a higher overall system mass .",
    "however , we can not determine the inclination on the basis of the low photometric amplitude .",
    "our light curve simulations imply that the mass of the compact object is at least 1.8 m@xmath3 based on an inclination of 60@xmath40 or less . * our value for",
    "the eccentricity of 0.24@xmath10.08 is a little smaller than previous determinations .",
    "the lower eccentricity implies that the wind material that is captured and falls into the roche lobe of the compact star has a lower specific angular momentum .",
    "thus it may not lead to the formation of a large - scale optically thick accretion disk , and the accretion inflow is practically radial resembling that of a bondi - hoyle flow .",
    "* this radial inflow would explain the lack of an accretion disk signature in kev data and should be considered in models of mass transfer for either a non - accreting pulsar or a black hole . * finally from ew measurements of the h@xmath12 line , we derived that the mass loss rate from the o - type primary through stellar wind is 3.7 to 4.8 @xmath4 m@xmath3 yr@xmath5 , similar to values obtained by other workers .",
