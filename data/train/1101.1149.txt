    "when calculating prices of different interest rate derivatives , such as bonds and bond options , stochastic methods seem to be more commonly used than pde methods ; compare for instance @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of stock option pricing where pde methods are used extensively , in particular for low dimensional problems .",
    "we believe that one possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the correspondence between the risk neutral valuation approach and the pricing equation ( henceforth referred to as the _ term structure equation _ ) with appropriate boundary conditions is not fully developed .    for the black  scholes equation ,",
    "the boundary condition is of dirichlet type which corresponds to the underlying asset being absorbed if reaching zero ; compare @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for most interest rate models this is not the case since the short rate typically would not stay zero if the value zero is reached .",
    "consequently , it is not clear what boundary conditions should be specified for the term structure equation .",
    "in fact , the recent monograph @xcite draws attention to this issue in a section entitled `` the thorny issue of boundary conditions . ''",
    "moreover , in @xcite , two different solutions to the term structure equation are presented in the case of the cir - model .",
    "they are both bounded and with the same terminal condition , but naturally they exhibit different boundary behavior for vanishing interest rates .",
    "the authors of that paper take the view that these solutions represent alternative possible prices .",
    "we on the other hand regard only the solution given by the stochastic representation as the price , and the purpose of the present paper is to identify the boundary condition that this stochastic representation satisfies .",
    "we consider the classical case of a single - factor model predicting nonnegative values of the short rate .",
    "more precisely , the rate @xmath0 is modeled directly under the pricing measure as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a brownian motion and @xmath3 and @xmath4 . as indicated above , the option price @xmath5 corresponding to a payoff function @xmath6 is given using risk neutral valuation by @xmath7.\\ ] ] note that if the payoff @xmath8 , then bond prices are obtained .",
    "also note that the set - up covers the case of bond options .",
    "the corresponding term structure equation is @xmath9 with terminal condition @xmath10 .",
    "if the price @xmath5 is twice continuously differentiable up to and including the boundary @xmath11 , then plugging in @xmath11 in the equation would give the boundary behavior @xmath12 even though there is extensive literature on equations with degenerating coefficients , compare the classical reference @xcite , the @xmath13-regularity of @xmath5 at the boundary is not available in the generality that is needed here .",
    "in fact , one of the solutions in the example in @xcite referred to above is bounded and continuous , but fails to be @xmath13 up to the boundary .",
    "( this solution , however , is not the one given by stochastic representation . )    in the present paper , sufficient regularity of the option price @xmath5 for ( [ bcpp ] ) to hold is established using the girsanov theorem and scaling arguments ; see sections  [ u_x ] and  [ u_xx ] .",
    "let us emphasize that ( [ bcpp ] ) is the correct boundary behavior of the option price regardless if the boundary is hit with positive probability or not .",
    "if the boundary can be reached with positive probability , then this boundary behavior serves as a boundary condition for the term structure equation and guarantees uniqueness . on the other hand ,",
    "if the boundary is reached with probability zero , equation ( [ bcpp ] ) is not needed to identify the solution given by the stochastic representation , and the term `` boundary condition '' is perhaps misleading .",
    "however , it is still valid and certainly useful , for instance , from a numerical perspective .",
    "indeed , the results of the present paper have already been implemented numerically in @xcite .",
    "for simplicity of the exposition , we will refer to ( [ bcpp ] ) as the boundary condition regardless if the boundary can be reached or not .    in section  [ halfline ] the assumptions on the model and our main result , theorem  [ main ] ,",
    "are presented . in sections",
    "[ u_x ] , [ u_xx ] and [ sahlin ] , we establish regularity properties of the value function , and use them to prove theorem  [ main ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ realline ] we also provide the link between the stochastic problem and the term structure equation for models defined on the whole real line .",
    "when studying the term structure equation on the positive real axis , we consider models which are specified so that the short rate automatically stays nonnegative , that is , there is no need to impose any boundary behavior of the underlying diffusion process . throughout sections  [ halfline][sahlin ] we work under the following hypothesis :    [ hyp ] the drift @xmath14)$ ] is continuously differentiable in @xmath15 with bounded derivative , and @xmath16 for all @xmath17 .",
    "the volatility @xmath18)$ ] is such that @xmath19 is continuously differentiable in @xmath15 with a hlder continuous derivative , and @xmath20 if and only if @xmath11 . the functions @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are all of , at most , linear growth : @xmath24 for all @xmath15 and @xmath17 .",
    "the payoff function @xmath25 is continuously differentiable with both @xmath6 and @xmath26 bounded .",
    "let @xmath2 be a standard brownian motion on a filtered probability space @xmath27 .",
    "since @xmath28 is continuously differentiable , @xmath22 is locally hlder ( 1@xmath292 ) in @xmath15 .",
    "it follows that there exists a unique strong solution @xmath0 to @xmath30 for any initial point @xmath31 ; compare section  ix.3 in @xcite .",
    "moreover , it follows from monotonicity results for stochastic differential equations with respect to the drift coefficient ( e.g. , theorem  ix.3.7 in @xcite ) , that @xmath32 remains nonnegative at all times",
    ". indeed , if @xmath21 is replaced with @xmath33 , then the corresponding solution to ( [ x ] ) is absorbed at zero , so @xmath32 is nonnegative if @xmath16 . the option price @xmath34\\to[0,\\infty)$ ] corresponding to a payoff function @xmath35 is given by @xmath36,\\ ] ] where the indices indicate that @xmath37 .",
    "as described in the , the corresponding term structure equation is given by @xmath38 for @xmath39 , with terminal condition @xmath40 moreover , by formally inserting @xmath11 in the equation we get the boundary condition @xmath41 for all @xmath42 , since @xmath3 by assumption .",
    "one of the main efforts in this paper is to show that the option price @xmath5 is continuously differentiable up to the boundary @xmath11 , and that it indeed satisfies the boundary condition ( [ bc ] ) in the classical sense .    a _ classical solution _ to the term structure equation is a function @xmath43 ) \\cap",

    "the option price @xmath5 as given by ( [ u ] ) is then the unique bounded classical solution to the term structure equation .",
    "classical short rate models such as the cox  ingersoll ",
    "ross model @xmath45 and the dothan model @xmath46 have boundary conditions at @xmath11 that are immediate to write down .",
    "these conditions are @xmath47 respectively .",
    "we note that the boundary condition @xmath48 for the dothan model means that @xmath5 is constant along the boundary , that is , @xmath49 .",
    "this is the same type of boundary condition that appears for options on stocks in @xcite , which can be explained by the fact that the dothan model is a geometric brownian motion .",
    "theorem  [ main ] also covers the hull ",
    "white model @xmath50 ( which is a time - dependent generalization of the cox ",
    "ross model ) , and models of , for example , the form @xmath51,\\ ] ] which also would be natural to consider for bond pricing .",
    "it seems that many of the classical models for the short rate are proposed for their analytical tractability . in particular ,",
    "if the drift @xmath21 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath52 are affine , then the model admits an affine term structure .",
    "it is easy to check that known explicit formulas for bond prices and bond options satisfy the boundary condition ( [ bc ] ) . in particular , for models admitting an affine term structure , it is a consequence of the associated riccati equations ( see @xcite , equation  22.25 ) that these boundary conditions are fulfilled .    the assumption that @xmath6 is continuously differentiable is satisfied for bonds , but not in general for bond options .",
    "however , using the markov property , theorem  [ main ] readily extends to bounded lipschitz payoffs provided one can show that the corresponding option price @xmath53 is continuously differentiable on @xmath54 for any @xmath55 .",
    "the regularizing effect of parabolic equations guarantees continuous differentiability on @xmath54 , so the main difficulty is to show that @xmath56 is continuous also at 0 . if the model is convexity preserving , this is easily done in certain cases including , for example , call options written on bond prices .",
    "( note that the corresponding payoff function @xmath6 is bounded since bond prices are bounded . ) for details on which short rate models are convexity preserving , see @xcite . to our knowledge ,",
    "all models used in practice belong to this class .",
    "one should note that the differentiability of the option price up to the boundary @xmath11 is not valid without some lipschitz bound of @xmath6 at 0 . to see this , consider the contract function @xmath57 .",
    "then , with @xmath58 and @xmath59 , it is straightforward using the it formula to show that the process @xmath60 is a martingale . consequently , the option price @xmath5 is given by @xmath61 for all @xmath17 , which fails to be a classical solution to the term structure equation since it is not differentiable at @xmath11 .",
    "one might argue , though , that the boundary condition @xmath62 is satisfied in a weak sense .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ main ] is carried out in several steps .",
    "proof of uniqueness let @xmath63 and @xmath64 be two bounded classical solutions to the term structure equation , and define @xmath65 then @xmath66 is a bounded solution to @xmath67 now consider the function @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a positive constant .",
    "for @xmath69 large enough , depending on @xmath70 and the growth rate of @xmath21 , @xmath71 is a super - solution to ( [ eqn ] ) which tends to infinity at spatial infinity .",
    "thus , according to the maximum principle , the function @xmath72 is bounded above by @xmath73 and below by @xmath74 for any @xmath55 .",
    "it follows that @xmath75 , which demonstrates uniqueness of bounded classical solutions to the term structure equation .",

    "it remains to show that @xmath5 is continuously differentiable up to the spatial boundary @xmath11 , and that it satisfies the boundary condition ( [ bc ] ) .",
