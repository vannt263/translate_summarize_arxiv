    "in the last 3 decades , knot theory has found many important applications in biology @xcite .",
    "more often than not , in such applications , a knot can no longer be treated as a volumeless simple closed curve in @xmath8 as in classical knot theory .",
    "instead , it has to be treated as a rope like object that has a volume .",
    "for example , it has been reported that various knots occur in circular dna extracted from bacteriophage heads with high concentration and it has been proposed that these ( physical ) knots can be used as a probe to investigate how dna is packed ( folded ) inside a cell @xcite .",
    "such applications motivate the study of thick knots , namely knots realized as closed ( uniform ) ropes of unit thickness .",
    "an essential issue here is to relate the length of a rope ( with unit thickness ) to those knots that can be tied with this rope .    to define the ropelength of a knot",
    ", one has to define the thickness of the knot first .",
    "there are different ways to define the thickness of a knot , see for example @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use the so called _ disk thickness _ introduced in @xcite and described as follows .",
    "let @xmath9 be a @xmath10 knot .",
    "a number @xmath11 is said to be _ nice _ if for any distinct points @xmath12 , @xmath13 on @xmath9 , we have @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the discs of radius @xmath17 centered at @xmath12 and @xmath13 which are normal to @xmath9 . the _ disk thickness _ of @xmath9 is defined to be @xmath18 is nice@xmath19 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the disk thickness definition can be extended to all @xmath20 curves .",
    "therefore , we restrict our discussions to such curves in this paper .",
    "however , the results obtained in this paper also hold for other thickness definitions with a suitable change in the constant coefficient .    for any given knot type @xmath0 , a _ thick realization _",
    "@xmath9 of @xmath0 is a knot @xmath9 of unit thickness which is of knot type @xmath0 .",
    "the _ ropelength _",
    "@xmath1 of @xmath0 is the infimum of the length of @xmath9 taken over all thick realizations of @xmath0 .",
    "the existence of @xmath1 is shown in @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to establish an upper bound on @xmath1 in terms of @xmath2 , the minimum crossing number of @xmath0 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that there is a constant @xmath3 such that for any @xmath0 , @xmath21 .",
    "this lower bound is called the _ three - fourth power law_. this three - fourth power law is shown to be achievable for some knot families in @xcite .",
    "that is , there exists a family of ( infinitely many ) knots @xmath22 and a constant @xmath23 such that @xmath24 as @xmath25 and @xmath26 . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that the three - fourth power law does not hold as the upper bound of ropelengths .",
    "in fact , it is shown in @xcite that there exists a family of infinitely many prime knots @xmath27 such that @xmath28 as @xmath25 and @xmath29 . that is , the general upper bound of @xmath1 in terms of @xmath2 is at least of the order @xmath30 .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that the upper bound of @xmath1 is of the order @xmath30 for any conway algebraic knot .",
    "the family of conway algebraic knots is a very large knot family that includes all 2-bridge knots and montesinos knots as well as many other knots .",
    "the approach used in @xcite is in fact a simpler version of the divide - and - conquer techniques used in this article .",
    "the best known general upper bound of @xmath1 until now is of order @xmath31 , which was obtained in @xcite .",
    "it remains an open question whether @xmath30 is the general ropelength upper bound for any knot @xmath0 .    in this paper , we prove that the general upper bound of @xmath1 is almost linear in terms of @xmath2 .",
    "more specifically , it is established that there exists a positive constant @xmath32 such that @xmath33 for any knot @xmath0 .",
    "this is accomplished by showing that a minimum projection of @xmath0 can be embedded in the cubic lattice as a planar graph in such a way that the total length of the embedding is of the order at most @xmath34 and that the original knot can be recovered by some local modifications to this embedding without significantly increasing the total length of this embedding .",
    "the construction of the embedding heavily relies on a divide - and - conquer technique that is based on separator theorems for planar graphs @xcite , but many new concepts and results are also needed in this quest .",
    "overall , this is a rather complicated ( at least technically ) task that requires attention to many technical details .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we introduce the basic concepts of topological plane graphs , cycle cuts and vertex cuts of plane graphs , and some important graph theoretic results concerning these cuts ( separator theorems of planar graphs due to miller @xcite ) . in section [ sec3 ]",
    ", we introduce the concept of a class of special plane graphs called brt - graphs .",
    "these are the plane graphs we use as basic building blocks when we subdivide knot diagrams . in section [ sec5 ] , we apply the separator theorems to show the existence of subdivisions of brt - graphs .",
    "it is a typical divide - and - conquer technique that such subdivisions must be  balanced \" , that is , each subdivsion produces two smaller brt - graphs of roughly equal size .",
    "we then show that we can apply these concepts recursively subdividing a brt - graph into smaller and smaller graphs . in section [ sec6 ]",
    ", we introduce the concepts of two special kinds of plane graph embeddings ( called  standard 3d - embedding \" and  grid - like embedding \" ) .",
    "these are not lattice embeddings .",
    "the grid - like embedding is almost on the lattice and is used as a basic building block to reconstruct the subdivided graphs .",
    "the standard 3d - embedding is used as bench mark for verifying the topology preservation of the reconstructed graphs obtained using the grid - like embedding .",
    "section [ sec77 ] is devoted to providing detailed descriptions on how to obtain a grid - like embedding of a plane graph either directly , or indirectly from reconnecting two grid - like embeddings of smaller brt - graphs obtained in the subdivision process .",
    "then in section [ sec73 ] , we show that a grid - like embedding obtained from reconstruction using our algorithm preserves the topology of the original graph .",
    "section [ sec9 ] establishes the upper bound on the length of the embedding generated by our embedding algorithm , from which our main theorem result follows trivially .",
    "finally , we end the paper with some remarks and open questions in section [ sec91 ] .",
    "throughout this paper , we use the concept of topologically equivalent graphs . in this case , the vertices are points in @xmath35 and the edges are space curves that can be assumed to be piecewise smooth . if two edges are incident at a vertex or two vertices , then they intersect each other at these vertices , but they do not intersect each other otherwise . a plane ambient isotopy is defined as a homeomorphism @xmath36\\rightarrow \\r^2 $ ] such that @xmath37 is a homeomorphism from @xmath38 to @xmath38 for each fixed @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "a plane graph @xmath41 refers to a particular drawing of a planar graph on the plane ( with the above mentioned conditions , of course ) .",
    "two plane graphs @xmath42 and @xmath43 are said to be _ topologically equivalent _ if there exists a plane isotopy @xmath44 such that @xmath45 .",
    "it is possible that there are plane graphs @xmath43 that are isomorphic to @xmath42 as graphs , but not topologically equivalent to @xmath42 .",
    "since the plane graphs of interest in this paper arise as knot or link projections with the over / under strand information ignored at the crossings , only topologically equivalent plane graphs are considered . at each vertex @xmath46 of a plane graph @xmath41 , a small circle @xmath47 centered at @xmath46",
    "is drawn such that each edge of @xmath41 incident to @xmath46 intersects @xmath47 once ( unless the edge is a loop edge in such case the edge will intersect @xmath47 twice ) . if @xmath47 is assigned the counterclockwise orientation , then the cyclic order of the intersection points of the edges incident to @xmath46 with @xmath47 following this orientation is called the _",
    "cyclic edge - order _ at @xmath46 .",
    "the following lemma assures that two isomorphic plane graphs are topologically equivalent if the cyclic edge - order is preserved by the graph isomorphism at every vertex .",
    "this fact can be easily established by induction on the order of the graph .",
    "we leave its proof to our reader as an exercise .",
