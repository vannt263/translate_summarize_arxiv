    "the present paper is motivated by a question of w. khnel @xcite : is it true that every @xmath1-connected graph @xmath2 contains a subdivision @xmath3 of the complete graph @xmath4 on four vertices such that @xmath5 is @xmath1-connected ?",
    "an affirmative answer of a slightly stronger result taking care of possible chords in that subdivision , as provided in the present paper , can be employed to construct an embedding of an arbitrary @xmath1-connected graph into @xmath15 whose intersection with any open half space is connected @xcite .",
    "problems on the existence of nonseparating  or , more generally , high - connectivity - keeping  subgraphs form a part of graph connectivity theory . of particular interest",
    "are questions on the existence of high - connectivity keeping paths or cycles through prescribed elements or of prescribed parity .",
    "for example , it has been conjectured by lovsz that for every @xmath16 there exists a smallest @xmath17 such that for any two vertices @xmath18 of an @xmath17-connected graph @xmath2 there exists an induced @xmath18-path @xmath19 such that @xmath20 is @xmath16-connected ( cited according to @xcite ) . presently , we know that @xmath21 and @xmath22 , but the existence of @xmath17 is open for all @xmath23 .",
    "another example along these lines is thomassen s and toft s theorem that every @xmath24-connected graph contains a nonseparating induced cycle @xcite , and thomassen s theorem that every @xmath25-connected graph @xmath2 contains an induced cycle @xmath26 such that @xmath27 is @xmath16-connected ( where the bound @xmath28 is sharp for all @xmath29 ) @xcite .",
    "there are variations of these results where the objects might have chords , i.  e. are not necessarily induced , and also variations and solutions where the edges are deleted instead of the vertices ( see , for example , ( * ? ? ? * conjecture 4 ) or @xcite ) .    by considering paths and cycles as subdivisions of @xmath30 and @xmath6 , respectively",
    ", one might ask if there are similar results for more complex substructures ( like for subdivisions or induced subdivisions of @xmath4 ) . the general , qualitative answer to this",
    "is `` yes '' :    [ t1 ] suppose that @xmath31 is a class of graphs such that there is an @xmath32 such that every @xmath32-connected graph contains a member from @xmath31 as a subgraph .",
    "then , for every @xmath16 , there exists an @xmath33 such that every @xmath33-connected graph @xmath2 contains a member @xmath3 of @xmath31 such that @xmath5 ( alternatively : @xmath34 ) is @xmath16-connected .",
    "this follows immediately from theorem 1 in @xcite that the vertex set of every @xmath35-connected graph @xmath2 admits a partition into two sets @xmath36 such that @xmath37,g[b]$ ] are @xmath16-connected and every vertex in @xmath38 has at least @xmath16 neighbors in @xmath39 ; any copy of @xmath40 in @xmath37 $ ] will do ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    the possibly easiest question beyond paths and cycles is to ask for the smallest @xmath16 such that every @xmath16-connected graph contains a nonseparating subdivision of @xmath4 .",
    "brute force application of theorem [ t1 ] leads to the fact that @xmath16 exists and is at most 55.296 ( quite large  on the other , hand this yields a subdivision @xmath3 of @xmath4 such that @xmath5 is even @xmath24-connected ) . a better bound",
    "can be obtained by the following recent generalization of thomassen s theorem on high - connectivity keeping cycles by fujita and kawarabayashi @xcite ; a _ theta _ is a graph isomorphic to a subdivision of @xmath41 , where @xmath41 is obtained from @xmath4 by deleting an edge .",
    "@xcite [ t2 ] for @xmath29 , every @xmath25-connected graph @xmath2 contains either @xmath41 as a subgraph , or it contains an induced theta @xmath42 such that @xmath43 is @xmath16-connected .    from this",
    "it follows that every @xmath44-connected graph @xmath2 has a nonseparating subdivision of @xmath4 : if @xmath2 contains @xmath4 as a subgraph then we are done , otherwise we first find an induced theta @xmath42 ( that might be a @xmath41 ) such that @xmath43 is @xmath24-connected by theorem [ t2 ] we then take neighbors @xmath18 in @xmath45 of two inner vertices of distinct subdivision paths . by what we have mentioned above ( `` @xmath21 '' ) ,",
    "there is an @xmath18-path @xmath19 in the @xmath24-connected graph @xmath43 such that @xmath46 is connected , so that @xmath47 $ ] is a nonseparating subgraph of @xmath2 , which contains the desired subdivision of @xmath4 as a spanning subgraph .",
    "similarly , we might use our knowledge on @xmath48 to prove that every @xmath49-connected graph @xmath2 has a subdivision @xmath3 of @xmath4 such that @xmath5 is @xmath50-connected .    here",
    "we prove first that every @xmath1-connected graph has a nonseparating subdivision of @xmath4 , where , in addition , we can avoid an arbitrary prescribed vertex ( see corollary [ c1 ] below ) .",
    "this is sharp in the sense that there are infinitely many @xmath24-connected graphs where every @xmath4-subdivision separates ; take @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "the result relies on a well - known structural characterization of the class of @xmath1-connected graphs stating that every @xmath1-connected graph can be reduced to a smaller one by contracting a single edge and simplifying , unless it is isomorphic to the square of a cycle or the line graph of a cubic graph ( theorem [ t3 ] below , see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the main technicalities to overcome here are    * to construct appropriate nonseparating subdivisions in @xmath2 from appropriate subdivisions in the graph @xmath53 obtained from @xmath2 by contracting a single edge ( for the induction step ) , and * to find a nonseparating induced theta in certain cubic simple graphs ( to let the induction start ) .",
    "it turned out , however , that these two steps do _ not _ rely on the @xmath1-connectedness of the graphs in question , and that ( a ) depends only on degree constraints to both @xmath2 and @xmath53 .",
    "so , apart from the application of fontet s and martinov s theorem on @xmath1-connected graphs , our proof `` works '' for connected graphs of minimum degree at least @xmath1 .    to really let it work in this case , we have designed a _ structure theorem for the simple connected graphs of minimum degree at least @xmath1 _ : we can reduce such a graph to a smaller such graph by deleting or contracting a single and simplifying , unless it is the square of a cycle or the edge disjoint union of certain bricks according to a pattern described by a connected hypergraph of rank at most @xmath24 as in theorem [ t5 ] .",
    "whereas in the @xmath1-connected case above , these bricks are just triangles , we need a number of isomorphism types of bricks for this , as depicted in figure [ f1 ] below .",
    "an alternative version of this in terms of decomposition into edge - disjoint subgraphs can be found in the abstract .",
    "we begin with a lemma on cubic graphs , which is the starting point of the inductive proofs of theorem [ t4 ] and theorem [ t6 ] .",
    "[ l1 ] let @xmath0 be a vertex of a simple connected cubic graph @xmath2 nonisomorphic to @xmath4 .",
    "then @xmath2 has a nonseparating induced subgraph isomorphic to a subdivision of @xmath41 avoiding @xmath0 .",
    "* we are looking for an induced nonseparating theta @xmath42 in @xmath2 avoiding @xmath0 .",
    "we proceed by induction on @xmath54 .",
    "if @xmath55 then @xmath2 must be a prism @xmath56 or @xmath57 .",

    ", @xmath42 is an induced subgraph of @xmath82 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath42 is a nonseparating induced theta in @xmath2 avoiding @xmath65 and hence avoiding @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath83 for distinct _ nonadjacent _ vertices @xmath18 , then let @xmath3 be the simple connected cubic graph @xmath3 obtained from @xmath84 by adding a single edge from @xmath63 to @xmath64 .",

    "if @xmath83 for distinct _ adjacent _ vertices @xmath18 , then let @xmath86 and @xmath87 , where @xmath88 are in @xmath65 and @xmath89 are not . it might be the case that @xmath90 , but the graph @xmath3 obtained from @xmath72 by adding a single edge connecting @xmath74 and adding a single edge connecting @xmath76 is simple , cubic , and connected ( see lower half of figure [ f2 ] ) . by applying induction to @xmath77 we find a nonseparating induced theta in @xmath3 avoiding @xmath79 , which is at the same time a nonseparating induced theta in @xmath2 avoiding @xmath65 , as above .",
    "hence we may assume that @xmath0 is not contained in a subgraph isomorphic to @xmath41 .",
    "if @xmath0 is on a triangle @xmath91 then @xmath92 consists of three independent edges , so that the graph @xmath3 obtained from @xmath2 by contracting @xmath91 to a single vertex @xmath93 is simple , connected , and cubic . since @xmath94",

    "otherwise , we apply induction to @xmath102 to find a nonseparating induced theta in @xmath26 avoiding @xmath64 , which will serve for @xmath2 , too",

    "hence the statement follows again by induction applied to @xmath110 .",
    "@xmath111    observe that , in lemma [ l1 ] we can not achieve that one of the subdivision paths of @xmath42 has length @xmath112 , because there are ( cubic ) graphs without cycles with a unique chord as an induced subgraph .",
    "the petersen graph and the heawood graph are basic examples , a full characterization can be derived from the main result in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we prove lemma [ l2 ] below , which will be employed as an inductive device to obtain nonseparating induced subdivisions in some graph @xmath2 from those in a minor of @xmath2 obtained by contracting a single edge and simplifying . there is a version in terms of _ deleting _ edges , which comes with a slightly less technical proof , but as we do not need it for our main result on @xmath1-connected graphs ( theorem [ t4 ] ) , we postpone it to a later section .    the attribute _ principal _ refers to objects of a subdivision @xmath3 of some graph @xmath19 which correspond to those of @xmath19 .",
    "so the _ principal vertices _ of @xmath3 are those of degree at least @xmath24 in @xmath3 if @xmath113 , principal vertices are _ principally adjacent _ in @xmath3 if they are adjacent in @xmath19 , and so on .",
    "moreover , we use path notation to describe certain basic subgraphs of the subdivision @xmath3 as follows : provided that @xmath19 is simple ( as it will be always the case ) , two vertices @xmath114 are on at most one common subdivision path .",
