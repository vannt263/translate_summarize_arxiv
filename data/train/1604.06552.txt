    "the large radio nebula w50 , also referred to as g39.72.0 and the `` manatee nebula '' , is both unusual and of an undetermined origin .",
    "the nebula appears to be interacting with the central compact source and microquasar ss433  the first known stellar source of relativistic jets @xcite .",
    "the w50/ss433 system was first identified at radio wavelengths by @xcite .",
    "initial suggestions for the system s origin were made by , e.g.  @xcite , which identified ss433 as a new class of stellar remnant ( the first - known galactic microquasar ) and proposed that the surrounding radio nebula of w50 was the remnant from a supernova explosion .",
    "the nebula is widely catalogued and considered as a supernova remnant ( snr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however this origin is still uncertain and debated .",
    "while the circular shell of w50 is reminiscent of shell - type snrs , the additional elongated morphology is completely anomalous .",
    "this elongation is at least partly due to the interaction between ss433 and w50 , with `` blobs '' of material being ejected at @xmath7 from the central engine of ss433 by precessing jets that are aligned along the east  west axis of elongation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the elongated morphology of the radio nebula could therefore have been formed by ( i ) _ a wind+jets model _ : with the ss433 jets expanding into a swept - up interstellar medium ( ism )  a stellar - wind bubble  that was itself created either entirely by the jets of ss433 or even by a continuous wind from the ss433 binary @xcite , or alternatively by ( ii ) _ a snr+jets model _ : with an encounter between the jets from ss433 and an already formed snr , with the ram pressure from the jets ` punching ' through the shell to form the ears . what is certain is that the w50/ss433 system  whether a wind - blown bubble or a snr  is an anomalous object",
    ". it could be a one - of - a - kind , and could also form part of a rare community of other peculiar galactic radio nebulae @xcite .    to further complicate matters , the morphology of the system is also affected by interactions between the swept - up media and the surrounding environment  which consists of a dense surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) and an ambient interstellar magnetic field .",
    "these environmental factors are important for w50 , as the west of the nebula appears in projection as dipping into the galactic plane  likely resulting in a density gradient across the source and expansion into an inhomogeneous ism .",
    "in addition , previous attempts at modelling w50 have largely neglected the impact of magnetic fields on the evolution of the nebula .",
    "the large - scale magnetic fields have likely played a crucial role in the development of w50  independent of the chief mechanism that drives the object s formation  as the interaction of magnetic fields is known to influence the evolution of wind - blown bubbles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , snrs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and other radio nebulae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , previous observations have revealed regular magnetic fields , including a strong field in the rim to the north .",
    "the polarization angle of this region is indicative of the ordered field strength being dominated by standard compression of an interstellar field that is oriented approximately east  west , with the radio ears that are generally believed to be punched out by ram pressure from the jets of ss433 also approximately aligned along this same axis .",
    "this further complicates understanding the evolution of w50 s morphology since , for example , a snr evolving in a strong ambient field is known to become elongated along the field direction @xcite , while in a wind - driven nebula a stellar wind with frozen - in toroidal fields can evolve into collimated outflows @xcite .",
    "the presence of magnetic fields may also influence the collimation of the jets of ss433 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which itself has likely had a strong influence on the nebula s evolution .",
    "furthermore , more complex models essentially consisting of either _ snr+wind+jets _ or _ wind+snr+jets _ could also influence the shape of w50 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "models have recently been proposed for generating asymmetric supernova remnants ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and even off - centred or asymmetric supernova explosions within a pre - existing wind - driven bubble could give rise to a morphology that resembles that of w50 .",
    "attempting to separate the magnitude of each of these multiple effects on the elongation of w50 ultimately requires a multi - wavelength study .",
    "for example , diffuse h@xmath1 emission is a reliable tracer of the ionised hydrogen content / thermal electrons in the surrounding environment , which can depolarize synchrotron radio emission emitted at a similar or greater distance along the line - of - sight and can thereby conceal the presence of ordered magnetic fields in the nebula ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "furthermore , the presence of optical filamentary emission associated with the central region of the nebula would most likely originate from shock - excited material in a snr with the surrounding ism being heated by the outgoing shock wave , and producing a set of filamentary shell - like structures that occur due to cooling behind the shock front .",
    "this shock - excited optical emission results in both filamentary and diffuse faint h@xmath1 emission , while the presence of diffuse optical emission can also be associated with a wind - blown bubble @xcite .",
    "a filamentary shell - like structure in h@xmath1 is therefore one way to distinguish a snr from a wind - driven bubble .",
    "however , neither of these scenarios are mutually exclusive .",
    "nevertheless , the discovery of such optical emission would allow for the optical spectra to be obtained  thereby providing a direct test of shock physics in the object , and potentially allowing for a definitive experiment to determine the origin of w50 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , if new optical filaments can be found , they would help us to understand the connections between the filamentary emission and the charged particles and ordered magnetic fields within w50 .",
    "if shocked optical filaments exist in w50 , do any of them have coincident synchrotron emission ?",
    "are the magnetic fields more strongly ordered in such filaments ? to what extent does the creation of optical filaments influence the orientation of the magnetic fields ? and",
    "conversely , to what extent do the magnetic fields influence the creation of the optical filaments ?    in this paper , we set out to understand the origin and formation of w50 , by performing a needed multi - wavelength study ",
    "obtaining new broadband 1 to 3  ghz radio data and complementary 1  arcsec spatial resolution h@xmath1 images that allow us to investigate both the large - scale magnetic fields and the ionised hydrogen content .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section  [ backgroundw50 ] we provide extensive background information and review of the much - studied w50/ss433 system , in section  [ datareduction ] we discuss the technical details of the data processing , in section  [ w50 ] we present and analyse our new multi - wavelength results , in section  [ discussion ] we provide a discussion of our findings , and in section  [ conclusions ] we provide our conclusions . throughout , we assume a distance to ss433 ( and by association w50 ) of @xmath8  kpc @xcite .",
    "this distance is still a source of some debate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the total intensity spectral index , @xmath1 , is defined in the sense @xmath9 . when referring to ` polarization ' , we refer to linear polarization unless otherwise specified .",
    "the radio nebula of w50 ( g39.72.0 ) has been studied thoroughly since its identification in the radio catalogue of @xcite , with a comprehensive literature dedicated to the object .",
    "w50 is a non - thermal galactic source of large angular extent ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the shape of the object has been compared to that of a conch shell ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and of an interstellar manatee . at radio wavelengths ,",
    "the morphology of the nebula of w50 is seen in projection as an approximately - circular shell that is @xmath11 in diameter with the bright compact point source ss433 located close to the geometric centre .",
    "there are two bright radio ears ( or ` ansae ' ) to the east and west of the nebula , and the entire radio structure appears elongated and aligned along this east  west axis  with the entire nebula covering @xmath10 on the sky . the western edge of the nebula dips into the galactic plane , as the system is at a galactic latitude of @xmath12 .",
    "the surrounding field of view contains several bright extragalactic radio sources , and a nearby hii region s74 to the nw .",
    "w50 is one of the largest galactic supernova remnants .",
    "such objects are poorly studied at high angular resolution due to their overall angular size and the considerable number of pointings required for full imaging at radio wavelengths .",
    "it has been shown that the nebula can be reproduced to a good approximation by the combined effects of the evolution of a snr shell and its interaction with the precessing jets from ss433 @xcite . while an accumulating body of evidence tends to be in favour of a snr origin ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , this is still a source of debate with some studies suggesting it is more likely a stellar - wind / interstellar bubble ( see section  [ intro ] ) .",
    "the object is certainly in a unique class of outflow - driven objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the progenitor that formed ss433 is typically presumed to have exploded @xmath13@xmath14  years ago @xcite .",
    "the morphology of w50 hints at an approximately circular explosion , with the `` ears '' having been `` punched '' through the rim by the relativistic jets moving outwards from ss  433 at 0.26@xmath15 .",
    "importantly , the contributions from an initial sn explosion , that probably preceded formation of the compact object ss433 , have not been convincingly distinguished from the impact of the jet and wind activity of the central compact system @xcite .",
    "recent studies in the optical and x - ray wavebands possibly suggest at least two distinctly different states of jet activity @xcite .    optical emission was first associated with w50 in the 1980 s @xcite , with filaments located @xmath16  arcmin to the e and w of ss433 , although none were located within the central region of the nebula itself .",
    "diffuse x - ray emission is also coincident with the optical filaments .",
    "the extended x - ray lobes or jets extend to the e and w along the precession axis of the radio jets , with the x - ray emission peaking in the region of the optical filaments @xcite .",
    "there has also been additional soft x - ray emission discovered in the ear to the e , coincident with the radio ear and associated with the terminal shock of the ss433 jets @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the jet terminates in a ring - like termination shock .",
    "no x - ray emission is found in the ear to the w , suggesting an inhomogeneous surrounding medium .",
    "both the x - ray emission discovered in the lobes , and the presence of the optical filaments , strongly implies a density enhancement to the e and w at a radius of @xmath16  arcmin from ss433 .",
    "this is consistent with the traced out shell that is visible at radio wavelengths to the n and s , and together with the optical filaments being oriented perpendicularly to the radio jets , implies an interaction between the jets with a preexisting shell .",
    "@xcite reported the first faint optical emission associated with the central region of the nebula itself , albeit in only a small rectangular region of @xmath17  arcmin width and height .",
    "the identification of more extensive optical filaments , especially if there was good correlation between the radio structure and the filaments , would lend increasing support to a _",
    "snr+jets _ hypothesis .",
    "such emission is challenging to observe , as it is expected to be faint , and possibly not visible at all due to dust extinction . to observe faint h@xmath1 emission",
    "also requires a continuum - correction .",
    "new sensitive and high - resolution surveys such as the isaac newton telescope photometric h@xmath1 survey of the northern galactic plane ( iphas ) may feasibly allow for their detection @xcite .      as mentioned in section",
    "[ intro ] , the large - scale magnetic fields in w50 are likely playing an influential role in the development of the object .",
    "the chief method with which to study cosmic magnetic fields is via radio polarimetry .",
    "observations of the linear polarization in radio nebulae can provide information on the physical processes driving the emission and propagation of synchrotron radiation . in the case of w50 , such observations have traditionally been complicated by the object s large angular size , although contemporary analyses have now been applied to numerous angularly - large astrophysical systems ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "as polarization is a direct tracer of magnetic field structure , its detection can enable investigations of the order and orientation of fields .",
    "this is particularly important in shocked regions  which compress and order magnetic fields . in particular ,",
    "the interaction between snrs and magnetic fields is a crucial one , as the shocked material from a sn explosion compresses fields that are frozen - in to the plasma .",
    "furthermore , magnetohydrodynamic turbulence can give rise to rayleigh  taylor instabilities in the sn shell that allows for a distinction between younger and older objects @xcite .",
    "in the case of w50 , the magnetic fields may also be influencing the jets of ss  433 .",
    "measurements of the faraday rotation , in the form of rotation measures ( rm ; see for a full review ) , are strong probes of the magnetic field structure in any foreground medium along the line - of - sight and across the face of a radio nebula , allowing us to distinguish between the presence of coherent and random fields . furthermore , detection of a rm gradient across the source and any resulting depolarization can allow us to infer the geometry and also the anisotropy of the field  which could be caused by either turbulent or systematically varying regular fields .",
    "such scenarios are presently unconstrained for w50 .",
    "while previous studies at radio wavelengths have shown that there is an inhomogeneous distribution of polarization from w50 , there is no understanding of whether this inhomogeneity could be the result of a very turbulent and randomly - distributed magnetic field internally to the nebula itself , depolarization in the surrounding environment of w50 , or due to unassociated magnetoionic material that is located in the foreground .",
    "furthermore , the previous rm measurements of @xcite used only two data points at different frequencies and were also subject to the well - known @xmath18-ambiguity .",
    "in addition , the limited sensitivity of these observations resulted in gaps where the polarization was too low to calculate a reliable rm across the entire eastern part of the central region , and several additional large gaps in the northern , western , and southern parts of the shell , and also the eastern ear .",
    "no spectropolarimetry of w50 using new less - ambiguous techniques , such as rm synthesis , has ever been performed  despite considerable technical advances in the handling of such data .",
    "the rms can be determined using the high sensitivity , broadband , and improved resolution observations now available with contemporary instruments such as the australia telescope compact array ( atca )  allowing us to understand the magnetic field geometry within the object , and how this varies across different parts of the nebula .",
    "such a magnetic field study is a useful tool for separating different contributions to the evolution of the object , as distinct patterns are expected to be imprinted on the observed rm in both the case of a _",
    "wind+jets _ @xcite or a _ snr+jets _ origin @xcite .",
    "there have been numerous previous studies of the w50 radio nebula at radio wavelengths .",
    "and @xcite observed the total intensity and the polarized emission of w50 at 1.7  ghz , 2.7  ghz , and 5  ghz with the 100-m effelsberg radio telescope .",
    "the brightest polarization was found to be associated with the northern and eastern edges at 1.7  ghz , with fractional linear polarizations up to @xmath19% . at 2.7  ghz , these areas are @xmath16% polarized , with the brightest polarization emanating within the roughly circular region of size @xmath20  degree centred on ss433 , and from the extreme eastern end of the source . at 5  ghz , the northern edge is @xmath21% polarized , with a magnetic field direction approximately tangential to the shell  typical of old snrs @xcite .",
    "this bright northern edge therefore appears to be a typical example of compression of the large - scale ambient interstellar magnetic field .",
    "the region that connects the central region and the eastern ear , and several other areas within the object were all found to be completely unpolarized .",
    "the entire western ear was also found to be completely unpolarized  even at a resolution of 30  arcsec @xcite .",
    "what creates this inhomogeneous distribution of polarization across the radio nebula is still unknown , and it could be the result of a very turbulent and randomly - distributed magnetic field internally to the nebula itself , depolarization in the surrounding environment of w50 , or due to unassociated magnetoionic material that is located in the foreground .",
    "using the urumqi survey at 5  ghz , also found strong polarized emission along the northeastern shell of the central part of w50 .",
    "they derived an integrated spectral index of @xmath22 , consistent with that found by @xcite .",
    "they find that measurements between 6  cm and 11  cm gave @xmath23 for the central part , and @xmath24 for the eastern ear .",
    "the eastern ear therefore appears to have a slightly steeper spectrum than the central region , consistent with the finding of @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , interferometer - based studies such as that by @xcite tend to find that the spectra flattens towards the western ear with @xmath25 and steepens towards the eastern ear with @xmath26 .",
    "these spectral index variations are likely due to stronger shocks and higher compression to the west where the shock is encountering a denser ism , and consistent with the location of the galactic plane .",
    "this interpretation is also consistent with the depolarization , which is less in the eastern part of the source and greater across the rest of the object  possibly implying variations on smaller angular scales due to increased structure in the magnetic field towards the west .",
    "the flattest spectra of all appear to be located in the southwestern rim , possibly as low as @xmath27 .",
    "in addition , @xcite also find other small features such as a `` chimney '' radiating away from the eastern ear of w50 .",
    "many of these features are also still not fully understood .",
    "the spectral index and rm distributions of the very brightest emission were studied in detail by @xcite , and two - frequency estimates were made of the depolarization and faraday rotation ( albeit subject to @xmath18-ambiguities , with low sensitivity , and with an angular resolution of 3  arcmin ) .",
    "rms were found to vary from 0  rad  m@xmath3 to as high as 240  rad  m@xmath3 .",
    "the rm in the eastern part of the source is either @xmath28  rad  m@xmath3 or ( @xmath29@xmath30)@xmath31  rad  m@xmath3 .",
    "in addition to @xmath18-ambiguities , the limited sensitivity of these observations resulted in gaps where the polarization was too low to calculate a reliable rm across the entire eastern part of the central region , and several additional large gaps in the northern , western , and southern parts of the shell , and the eastern ear .",
    "the rms of these regions can be determined using the high sensitivity , broadband , and improved resolution observations now available with contemporary instruments such as the atca ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* )  allowing us to understand the magnetic field configuration within the object , and how this varies across different parts of the nebula .",
    "sensitive polarimetry has the potential to separate the extent to which the morphology of w50 is dominated by extrinsic effects or coupling between the jet / remnant .",
    "if the ear - like structures to the e & w do originate due to the jets of ss433 , then there should in principle be consistent variations in the spectral index , fractional polarization , and rm in both sides of the source  allowing us to distinguish between competing scenarios for the remnant s formation such as the _ wind+jets _ and the _ snr+jets _ models , as described in section  [ intro ] .      as discussed in section",
    "[ intro ] , filamentary h@xmath1 emission associated with large - scale radio nebulae can allow distinction between competing models for an object s formation .",
    "an optical filamentary nebulosity has already been identified in the w50/ss433 system @xcite , that is visible in both h@xmath1 and sii .",
    "these bright filaments are located in the eastern and western ears , and are aligned perpendicular to the axis of the jets from ss433 . as the relativistic jet from ss433 appears to have broken through the edge of the central region of w50 , it is of interest that this bright optical emission lies at these breakout regions and is therefore likely a consequence of the jet activity .",
    "these breakout regions have been discussed further by @xcite . in an ideal case ,",
    "the breakouts are rings of emission that occur where the expanding jet envelope shocks a dense shell of swept - up and compressed material at the boundary of the circular region of w50 .",
    "optical emission should then not be observed throughout the circular region , which is too hot and rarefied , and with the ambient medium being of too lower density in front of the jet . as the jet axis of ss433",
    "is tilted with the eastern edge pointing towards us @xcite , this orientation modifies the rings of optical emission into ellipses .",
    "it has been argued that the observed arc morphology is due to heavy , patchy foreground interstellar absorption , so that only the component of the ring nearer to us along the line - of - sight remains visible @xcite .",
    "however , such a mechanism would likely require absorption within the nebula , as purely foreground material should affect both the front and back of the ring .",
    "while this overall picture is consistent with the observed arc morphology , it does not account for the known ` corkscrew ' structure of the jet close to ss433 , which is also markedly imprinted onto the radio features of the eastern ear ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "until recently , there was no known optical emission associated with the central region of w50 . however , a small rectangular region of @xmath17  arcmin width and height was observed by @xcite , who found faint optical emission associated with this central region of w50 .",
    "the observed region was not large enough to make definitive statements about the formation of the object , or to connect this optical emission with the radio morphology .",
    "these results suggest that a deep optical mosaic across the entirety of w50 would help to locate additional optical filaments .",
    "filamentary h@xmath1 emission tends to be produced by shocks ( see section  [ intro ] ) , and has been identified in several snrs .",
    "the _ snr+jets _ model would suggest that there would be faint filaments that cover all of the circular portion of the object , and which due to different pressures would be expected to be considerably fainter than the previously identified , jet - driven , optical emission . identifying a network of such optical filaments would lend significant support to the _ snr+jets _ model , and future studies would be able to use any new filaments to obtain in - depth information on the kinematics throughout the shell  thereby allowing an experiment to determine the formation history of w50 .",
    "such observations are complicated in that they require a large optical mosaic that deals with continuum - contamination , and are also hindered by possible interstellar dust extinction towards the galactic plane .",
    "nevertheless , many of the observational challenges have already been overcome ( see section  [ halpha ] ) . from the h@xmath1/h@xmath32 ratios",
    ", it has also been inferred that there is likely patchy absorption of optical emission across w50 @xcite  consistent with the distance and galactic latitude .",
    "while the presence of foreground dust that heavily obscures the optical emission is potentially problematic , both the patchiness and the small piece of faint emission in the interior of w50 suggest there may be new fainter filaments waiting to be discovered .",
    "we obtained full spectropolarimetric observations of the w50/ss433 system using the atca .",
    "we collected six days of data , using three different hybrid array configurations ( h75 , h168 , and h214 ) which are all compact and well - suited for observing at low declinations , with baseline lengths distributed between 31 to 230  m. we used the cabb system @xcite , which provided 2  ghz of instantaneous bandwidth centred at 2.1 ghz in 2048 spectral channels .",
    "as w50 is above the elevation limit of atca for @xmath339h  49 m per day , we used six full - track observations consisting of 66  hours in total which included overheads for standard calibration , full parallactic angle coverage of a leakage calibrator , and antenna slew times ( i.e.  @xmath34  hours in each hybrid configuration ) .",
    "our @xmath0 mosaic consisted of 198 pointings . in order to obtain an approximately uniform sensitivity pattern across w50 , and to limit instrumental effects ,",
    "the pointings were arranged in a hexagonal pattern such that they nyquist - sample the sky at the high - frequency end of the band .",
    "details of the observations are provided in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "@xmath35    in order to measure the large - scale magnetic fields , we only require the detection of diffuse extended linearly polarized emission .",
    "this requires only low - angular resolution data that have sensitivity to large angular scales , i.e.  short baselines .",
    "note that observations of a large galactic object such as w50 can be well - suited to a radio interferometer , rather than a single dish , as the former naturally filters out the very large - scale galactic emission that would otherwise require subtraction and would thereby affect our interpretation .",
    "the observing strategy here is appropriate for our scientific questions .",
    "the hybrid configurations at the atca are ideal for this , as they are nominally sensitive to a largest angular scale of @xmath36  arcmin in mosaiced total intensity , while simulataneously providing a synthesised beam of @xmath37  arcsec to @xmath38  arcsec across the band .",
    "mosaicing is also a standard procedure with the atca .",
    "the excision of narrow band radio frequency interference ( rfi ) and calibration were carried out using standard techniques in the miriad package .",
    "data were loaded into miriad and flagged for known bad channels and edge effects using the automated flagging routine pgflag .",
    "the default settings were found to discard significant quantities of good data , and were adjusted to provide several iterative loops of flagging and calibration using customised parameters  allowing for lighter flagging in each loop . due to the compact configurations used ,",
    "flags were also applied to remove shadowed antennas . during the data reduction ,",
    "the fixed antenna ca06 was also flagged throughout the observations  and was thereby not included during the imaging stage  in order to avoid a very significant gap in the @xmath39-coverage .",
    "a standard initial calibration was performed to correct for the effects of the bandpass and the complex antenna gains using the tasks mfcal @xmath40 gpcal @xmath40 gpcopy to transfer solutions from the flux calibrator ( pks1934 - 638 ) to the phase calibrator ( j1859 + 129 ) .",
    "the frequency - dependent instrumental leakages were then calculated in 16 bins across the full bandwidth using gpcal and the phase calibrator  which was observed over a large range in parallactic angle .",
    "the absolute flux scale was bootstrapped using gpboot , and the final solutions then linearly interpolated across the 198 pointings of the target source ( w50 ) .",
    "all of the sources ( including calibrator scans and target pointings ) were then gently flagged ( being careful to avoid over - flagging ) before iteratively performing a new calibration loop ( which provided improved solutions due to the removal of bad data ) .",
    "once flagging was complete , a final calibration loop was then performed to provide the complete dataset .",
    "no self - calibration was performed .",
    "channels at the edges of the bandpass were discarded . due to the rfi environment , which at atca is selectively worse at lower - frequencies , it was found that the usable region of the band extended from 1.4  ghz to 3.1  ghz .",
    "channels outside of this range tended to have very limited @xmath39-coverage , particularly on shorter baselines .",
    "high - quality mosaic imaging of this field of view is complicated , as it contains diffuse extended emission from w50 , compact sources embedded in diffuse emission , and large - scale diffuse emission from the galaxy .",
    "the field of view is also at a low declination ( @xmath41 ) , has imperfect and limited @xmath39-coverage ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ figuvcoverage ] ) , and was observed with a broad 2  ghz bandwidth .",
    "two techniques were therefore used for separate wide - field , wide - band imaging of both the total intensity ( stokes @xmath42 ) and the linearly polarized intensity ( stokes @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) emission .    to image stokes @xmath42 ,",
    "the common astronomy software applications ( casa  v4.2.0 ) package was used to process the wide - field , wide - band data , as the package implements the full - mosaic , multi - frequency synthesis algorithms that are now available .",
    "the mosaic imaging was not able to simultaneously solve for the spectral index in the current implementation of casa , as mosaics can currently only be processed with nterms=1 .",
    "however , the incorporation of the large 2  ghz bandwidth substantially improved the @xmath39-coverage available for imaging the complex field of view  albeit with some frequency - dependent artefacts appearing around very bright sources such as ss433 .",
    "as the mosaic imaging process employed in casa combines the individual pointings in @xmath39-space , we are essentially imaging a single @xmath45 field - of - view ; we therefore also used the @xmath46-projection algorithm with 256 terms .",
    "subtraction during deconvolution using the clean algorithm in casa also takes place in the @xmath39-plane , allowing for a more accurate clean , and the hogbom - type deconvolution was performed slowly with a very - low loop gain , 0.005 , in order to avoid confusing emission and sidelobes when extended emission was present .",
    "a high cyclefactor of 5 was also used in order to complete major clean - cycles more often .",
    "the final image has a resolution of @xmath47  arcmin with a position angle of @xmath48 .    to create stokes @xmath43 and @xmath44 image datacubes ,",
    "the miriad package was used , which is specifically designed to handle data with linear feeds ( i.e.  @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 ) such as that from the atca .",
    "deconvolution of the images from the synthesised dirty beam took place in the image - plane .",
    "the data were imaged using multi - frequency synthesis of both 10  mhz and 100  mhz channel - subsets in order to balance maintaining good @xmath39-coverage while also minimising bandwidth depolarization . due to the large observational frequency range ,",
    "the bandwidth depolarization varies across the band . for the 10  mhz channel dataset , significant bandwidth depolarization , where @xmath53/@xmath54 are the intrinsic polarization",

    "note that the 100  mhz dataset has improved @xmath39-coverage relative to the 10  mhz dataset , whereas the 10  mhz dataset is more sensitive to high rms .",
    "the data were imaged with a robust setting of @xmath56 , giving moderately uniform weights and avoiding excessive weight being given to visibilities in relatively sparsely - filled regions of the @xmath39-plane .",
    "an image of size 168 pixels was made for each pointing before the mosaic operation was performed , and each image was over - sampled , with a cell - size of 15  arcsec .",
    "the images were deconvolved from the synthesised dirty beam using mossdi , and a gain of 0.01 .",
    "a constant restoring beam was used for all images across the band , using the best angular resolution at the low - frequency end of the band of @xmath57  arcmin with a position angle of @xmath58 .",

    "the mosaicing process in casa includes the effects of the frequency - dependent total intensity primary beam . in miriad ,",
    "a frequency - dependent primary beam model ( the ` atca16 ' model ) for the cabb feeds was used .",
    "in addition , the stokes @xmath43 and @xmath44 images are also affected by the off - axis instrumental polarization beam . with cabb",
    ", this instrumental leakage has been estimated to be as large as @xmath59% at the half - power point @xcite .",
    "we here make the critical assumption that this instrumental polarization is oriented radially outwards from the phase - centre so that the altitude  azimuth mounts will cancel out instrumental effects via vector averaging over the large parallactic angle range .",
    "the mosaicing procedure will further reduce the wide - field polarimetric aberrations by a factor of at least @xmath60 , and will be aided further as we have closely - packed ( better than nyquist - sampled ) mosaic spacings .",
    "wide - field polarization effects are therefore expected to be very small within the central portion of the mosaic , while strong linear polarization at the edges of the mosaic is likely spurious .",
    "for the linear polarization data , we do not need to image the entire band simultaneously into one image  we only need to produce a stokes @xmath43 and @xmath44 datacube of narrow - band channels as a function of frequency , so that we can fourier transform the data and measure the peak faraday depth using the technique of rotation measure synthesis .",
    "the observations allow for rm synthesis across a bandwidth that to our knowledge is unprecedented for any large radio nebulae .",
    "the large bandwidth provides a rm spread function ( rmsf ; the point spread function in faraday space ) of fwhm 107.2  rad  m@xmath3 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figrmsf ] .",
    "no weights were applied during rm synthesis .",
    "the few gaps in the frequency - coverage also provide low sidelobe levels within the rm range in which we are primarily interested .",
    "we do not deconvolve the data from the rmsf using the technique of rm - clean @xcite .",
    "as we are sensitive to different angular scales in our @xmath42 and @xmath43/@xmath44 images respectively , we can not calculate accurate polarized fractions or correct for the effects of spectral index ( see section  [ limitations ] ) .",
    "this prevents accurate rm - deconvolution , but is only an amplitude effect , i.e.  our estimates of rms are unaffected .",
    "in addition , the technique of rm - deconvolution has been found to have several limitations and makes many simplifying assumptions @xcite  we therefore avoid all issues associated with deconvolution techniques .",
    "the full faraday structure of the remnant can likely only be obtained with @xmath61-fitting , to include the effects of depolarization across the band  although this has not yet been applied to extended objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "full @xmath61-fitting is beyond the scope of this current work , and would likely be required to fully separate the magnetic field contributions that arise both within the local environment of w50 and along the line - of - sight in any intervening faraday rotating media .",
    "nevertheless , other properties such as the depolarization and correlations with other structural features of the radio nebula can also allow elucidation of these properties .",
    "using our data , we are in principle also able to detect faraday thick structures along the line - of - sight ( i.e.  as @xmath62 ) . we define a faraday thick source as those with @xmath63 , where the extent of the source in faraday depth , @xmath64 , is given by @xmath65 .",
    "our atca data are therefore sensitive to thicknesses @xmath66  rad  m@xmath3 at 3.1  ghz , and to @xmath67  rad  m@xmath3 at 1.4  ghz",
    ". a line - of - sight can therefore appear to be subtly extended in faraday space , relative to the fwhm of the rmsf@xmath68  rad  m@xmath3 , however we can not _ resolve _ faraday thick structures .",
    "furthermore , with a noise level in our faraday cubes of 0.125  mjy  beam@xmath69  rmsf@xmath69 , this is the most sensitive mosaic of w50 that has been created in linear polarization .      due to the large observational bandwidth , there is substantial variation in the @xmath39-coverage across the band , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figuvcoverage ] .",
    "this is problematic for consistent imaging of the very extended emission in the total intensity images .",
    "as shorter @xmath39-spacings are better sampled at lower observational frequencies , the extended emission is both better reconstructed and has less missing flux at these low frequencies .",
    "this tends to provide overly steep spectral indices that vary with position in the image depending on the scale of the emission .",
    "this overestimation of a steep spectral index due to frequency - dependent @xmath39-coverage is an inherent property of ultra broadband observations that is potentially generally overlooked . due to the limited number of baselines , attempts at imaging with a constant @xmath39-range across the band produced artefacts in the final images .",
    "in addition , the capability to perform both mosaic imaging and to simultaneously obtain a spectral index is not yet available ( see section  [ imaging ] ) , and our data can not therefore be easily used to recover the spectral index .",
    "the recovery of spectral indices is particularly difficult for this field of view as the western edge of the nebula dips into the galactic plane , with increased diffuse background emission .",
    "this background emission changes across the band , along with dc offsets in the images , and also causes low - level frequency - dependent changes in the antenna system temperature .",
    "in addition , inaccuracies in the primary beam model and its frequency dependence can also affect the spectral index ",
    "although the closely - packed mosaic and the applied primary beam model should minimise such an effect . furthermore , there is also increased rfi at the low - frequency end of the cabb band  which selectively tends to have a larger effect on shorter baselines .",
    "the flagging of these rfi affected data can therefore tend to remove larger scale structures at the low - frequency end of the band .",
    "the ability to use techniques such as @xmath70@xmath70 plots ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and spectral tomography @xcite is limited as we have multiple narrow channels across our band .",
    "attempts to reimage our data as two separate channels and to apply these techniques did not provide consistent results as the @xmath39-coverage still varies significantly .",
    "additional observations to more fully sample shorter spacings in the @xmath39-plane would assist in recovering all of the extended total intensity emission across the band  however another facility is likely required , as with the atca hybrid arrays we are essentially sampling the shortest spacings that the interferometer can provide ( although rfi preferentially affects the very shortest baselines ) .",
    "these issues also prevent us from calculating reliable polarization fractions , @xmath71 , since different scales , negative bowls , and background emission are retrieved in both the @xmath72 and @xmath42 images .",
    "fortunately , these effects are much less significant for our polarization images , as the emission is only ever a fraction of the total intensity emission , and is also broken up into much smaller scale structures  with the polarized emission being separated into individual @xmath43 and @xmath44 components , and also being broken up in the plane of the sky due to polarization angle variations ( and faraday rotation ) .",
    "since we use rm synthesis to recover the peak in the faraday spectra , any such residual amplitude effect will not affect the derived rms and will only affect the measured polarized intensity at a given rm , i.e.  it is only an amplitude effect in faraday space . in cases of multiple faraday components , the highest amplitude component could feasibly be misidentified , although we have not identified such multiple components in our data .",
    "we can therefore obtain reliable rms despite variations in @xmath39-coverage across the band and without having to assume a spectral index during rm synthesis .",
    "we created a large continuum - corrected h@xmath1 mosaic covering the full @xmath73 region surrounding w50/ss433 , using data release 2 ( dr2 ) observations from iphas @xcite .",

    "imaging of extended nebulae requires a well - behaved background on the ccds , and the limitations of such a technique are largely due to background variations .",
    "the sky generally subtracts fairly well in an h@xmath84 image , albeit with a few imaging artefacts that can occur on occasion @xcite .      to create the mosaic , ccd images were initially downloaded from the iphas data repository , alongside the corresponding confidence maps of each field .",
    "the confidence maps were used to create an image mask , and to filter out confidence values below 0.9 .",
    "this tended to remove bright corner regions that were present in ccd3 , bad pixels streaks across the images , and also removed some additional bad data around the ccd edges .",
    "the images were all then individually regridded into the ` sin ' world - coordinate system projection corresponding to that used for the atca images .",

    "this is only at the level of a few counts in each image , and so is not visible in single - pointing mosaics , but can dominate the emission at larger scales .",
    "it was found that by limiting the size of the mosaic to @xmath87 pixels , that the features in the images were still clearly visible with no obvious large - scale background variation .",
    "attempts to increase the mosaic size beyond this would likely require an alternative approach to remove any gradient , but this was not necessary to cover the angular extent of w50 .",
    "as we are only interested in the morphology of optical emission associated with w50 , rather than attempting to obtain any quantitative flux measurements , we were able to provide a continuum - correction by subtracting the median image value individually from the h@xmath1 and @xmath85 mosaics , and then creating a final image of h@xmath88 . in combination with the lack of gradient removal ,",

    "however , this does not take depolarization effects into account ( see section  [ depol ] ) .    in the presence of the diffuse h@xmath1 , the polarized emission from w50 itself , and also some of the galactic polarized emission , both exhibit complete depolarization .",
    "this indicates that the warm ionised gas / thermal electrons that are traced by the diffuse h@xmath1 emission must be acting as a faraday screen that appears to be located in the foreground of w50/ss433 .",

    ", we obtain @xmath133  mjy  beam@xmath69 , and the brightest total intensity in the region reaches 25.93  mjy  beam@xmath69 .",
    "this allows us to place a @xmath130 upper limit on the polarized fraction within the eastern funnel of @xmath134% .",
    "note that due to the limited spatial - scales sampled by the interferometer , there can be significant missing flux in the total intensity image at 2.1  ghz ( see section  [ limitations ] ) .",
    "our limits on the polarized fractions are therefore likely conservative .",
    "we assume that the depolarizing faraday screen traced by the diffuse h@xmath1 consists of a magnetoionic region that has a negligible amount of relativistic particles and that exists somewhere along the line - of - sight between the observer and the source .",
    "if this faraday screen contains a constant regular field and has a homogeneous distribution of free electrons , then the region causes faraday rotation of the polarized emission from background sources , but does not cause any physical depolarization ( remember that for depolarization , the magnetic field along the line - of - sight is nt necessarily relevant , but rather the magnetic field in the plane of the sky as seen in projection )",
    ". nevertheless , any deviation from a constant field within the synthesised beam , or any density fluctuations in the number of thermal electrons , will create a rm gradient and subsequently cause depolarization . in the case of magnetic fields ,",
    "such anisotropy is caused by either turbulent , or systematically varying regular fields .",
    "we assume that the depolarization can be well - described by the model proposed by @xcite ( for a full review of external faraday depolarization effects , see @xcite ) . in this case , @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the measured fractional polarization , @xmath137 is the intrinsic fractional polarization , @xmath138 is the observing wavelength , and @xmath139 characterises the rm fluctuations within the observing beam , where we assume a gaussian distribution of rms within the beam .",

    "] ( and is also dipping into the galactic plane ) .",
    "this could mean that our estimate of the variations in the foreground screen could be overestimated , with a contribution to this depolarization also occurring in the local ism immediately surrounding w50 .",
    "nevertheless , our estimate still reliably constrains the overall fluctuations in the plane of the sky towards the nebula  which we have shown is substantially affected by the ionised gas distribution .",
    "we present a toy model interpretation of the location of the diffuse h@xmath1 clouds relative to w50 itself in fig .",
    "[ figrgb3 ] .",
    "clouds are shown in purple , and are located between w50 and the observer . ]    it could be argued that the distribution of linear polarization from w50 also appears to show a correlation with the location of a diffuse molecular cloud , as inferred from co observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , there is no plausible mechanism that would allow such a cloud to preferentially allow the transmission of linearly polarized radio emission in contrast to the surrounding regions .",
    "more recent observations also suggest there is no convincing evidence for an interaction of the w50/ss433 system with this molecular cloud @xcite , and so the cloud is most likely simply coincidentally aligned with w50 .",
    "we here follow the results presented in section  [ faradayrotation ] , and consider the foreground faraday rotation determined in section  [ rmforeground ] .",
    "the median foreground rm of the @xmath110 radius patch towards the w50/ss433 system is consistent with @xmath142  rad  m@xmath3 .",
    "however , we are unable to constrain any spatial foreground variations at scales less than @xmath110 .",
    "the location of w50 near to the galactic plane , and situated in an area with rapidly - varying galactic emission , and with a known depolarizing faraday screen ( see section  [ depol ] ) , suggests that the observed variation in rm across the face of w50 could be due to foreground variations .",
    "indeed , the rms of the diffuse polarized emission that surrounds w50 changes sign in both the east and the west , which shows that the foreground magnetic field structure is complicated . nevertheless , the variation in the rms of the polarized emission of w50 itself shows no obvious relation to the depolarizing screen , e.g.  there are no enhancements or variations of the rm near to the diffuse h@xmath1 clouds .",
    "this suggests either that the rm variations are intrinsic and related to the local environment , or that there are additional intervening screens of significant angular extent and of unknown origin .",
    "the observed rms towards the w50/ss433 system appear to show two key morphological features , as discussed in section  [ atcarms ] : ( i ) the central region of w50 appears to have an axis of symmetry that separates two large regions of oppositely - signed rm .",
    "this axis of symmetry appears to be located somewhere between @xmath143 to @xmath144 relative to the north  south axis that intersects ss433 , and ( ii ) the eastern ear of w50 appears to have an axis of symmetry that lies parallel to the jet - axis , with positive rms to the north and negative rms to the south . as both of these features appear to be related to other morphological features of w50 , and in combination with the average foreground rm being consistent with @xmath142  rad  m@xmath3 , we interpret the observed rm variations to be intrinsic and directly related to the environment of w50 .",
    "while such an interpretation is strongly dependent on our foreground estimate , we would require a very large error in our estimate to remove the rm - axis associated with the central region  with a foreground offset of @xmath145  rad  m@xmath3 required to completely remove any axis across the source .",
    "this further suggests that the foreground is likely not responsible for this feature .",
    "similarly , the galactic polarized emission that surrounds the eastern ear has a positive rm that is continuous across both the positive and negative regions of the emission associated with w50 s ear .",
    "the sharp transition from the rm of @xmath104  rad  m@xmath3 associated with the galactic emission to the weaker @xmath146  rad  m@xmath3 associated with the ear , also suggests that the galactic foreground can not be responsible for this feature .",
    "however , this transition from @xmath104  rad  m@xmath3 to @xmath146  rad  m@xmath3 suggests that the galactic emission is located behind the ear .",
    "if the galactic emission were originating in the foreground of the ear , one would expect the @xmath104  rad  m@xmath3 to be imprinted on part of the eastern ear , which is clearly not the case .",
    "nevertheless , the observed rm variations across some parts of the source could be due to galactic foreground variations , which hinders enabling an accurate determination of the intrinsic properties of the magnetised plasma within the radio nebula  especially at a galactic latitude of @xmath147 .",
    "the rm of the foreground diffuse galactic emission , visible in both the east and west of the atca mosaic , very clearly varies in both sign and magnitude on angular scales smaller than that of w50 .",
    "it is likely that much more sophisticated techniques for modelling the foreground magnetic field structure in the galaxy will need to be developed before a comprehensive understanding of the magnetic field structure in the object can be ascertained .",
    "the faraday rotation of the eastern ear can be interpreted as evidence that there is a toroidal- or helical - shaped magnetic field that loops about the axis from the jets , with the magnetic field facing away from us in the southern part of the ear , and facing towards us in the northern part of the ear .",
    "the magnetic field is not an exact loop , with positive rms to the north , negative rms to the south , and intermediately positive rms in the conjoining intermediate region of @xmath148  rad  m@xmath3 .",
    "interestingly , the axis of symmetry of the rms would become much more strongly aligned with the jet - axis after subtracting our foreground rm estimate of @xmath112  rad  m@xmath3 .",
    "this rm - feature is also consistent with x - ray observations , which find that the eastern ss433 jet terminates in the eastern ear in a _ ring - like _ ` terminal shock ' .",
    "the spatial coincidence of x - ray and radio emission in this region suggests that the physical conditions of the terminal shock region are very similar to those found at the outer shocks of ordinary supernova remnants , and indicates the interaction between the terminal shock of the jet and the circumstellar medium .",
    "the x - ray emission is very strongly correlated with the radio - continuum emission and seems to form a ring - like structure confined by the outer boundary of the radio remnant , and indicative of the braking of a hollow - cone flow .",
    "suggest this indicates that the final jet - flow may retain a hollow - cone morphology .",
    "the thermal x - ray component has a low - fitted temperature which implies that the terminal shock must not be very strong , and that the jet - flow must have been considerably slowed down from its initial @xmath7 .",
    "where and how this deceleration happens , remains unclear ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the faraday rotation of the central region can be interpreted as evidence that there is a shell - like magnetic field looping around the central region of the radio nebula .",
    "this is consistent with observations of snrs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it has been shown by @xcite that the rm of a uniform ambient medium that is swept - up into a shell by an expanding snr can leave a strong imprint on the rm variations of the resulting shell itself .",
    "following @xcite , the resulting variations in rm can therefore be used to infer the in - situ ambient magnetic field geometry of the gas into which the snr has exploded . however , there is a known strong density gradient running e ",
    "w in w50 , identified by both the spectral index and morphology of the western ears ( see section  [ backgroundw50 ] ) , and yet this gradient is not identified in the rm structure . similarly , as the shell of w50 is only clearly visible to the n and s , this provides an axis of symmetry for the radio nebula .",
    "if the snr had swept up a uniform magnetic field it would be expected to leave identical rm gradients along each edge , with the gradient aligned with the objects axis of symmetry @xcite .",
    "such a gradient is not observed . as an alternative explanation",
    ", a shell could have embedded an imprint in the rms of the ambient magnetic field left behind by a progenitor wind .",
    "again following @xcite , at large distances from a stellar surface , stellar winds are expected to have largely toroidal fields  if such a field geometry is preserved after material was swept up by an outgoing shock front , this could produce a rm pattern that was negative on one limb of the snr and positive on the other .",
    "this does qualitatively appear to fit the observations of w50 .",
    "nevertheless , such an analysis is non - trivial for the w50/ss433 system , which could have a wind - blown bubble origin . in models of wind - blown bubbles",
    "in which a fast - wind ( or supernova ejecta ) overtakes and `` sweeps - up '' a slower magnetised wind from a prior state of stellar evolution , in the case of an azimuthal field , the resultant radio nebula displays two arc - like features with oppositely - signed rms ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the negative rms along the ridge to the sw of the central region below ss433 are also visible in the image of @xcite , who find that unlike the rest of the object , this region does not have a tangential distribution of magnetic field relative to the shell but rather that the magnetic fields run directly along the ridge .",
    "this may imply that we are seeing polarization from the front layers of the shell in this region , with polarization further along the line - of - sight having already been depolarized by faraday effects within the nebula .",
    "this would be consistent with the total intensity spectral index variations across w50 , and with the diffuse depolarizing foreground screen near to this area  which both imply a denser environment with more small - scale structure in the magnetic field towards the galactic plane .",
    "the analysis is complicated further due to the action of the ss433 jets that could have entirely remodified the magnetic field structure of w50 .",
    "indeed , one could argue that there is an axis of symmetry in the rms of the central portion of w50 that are aligned perpendicularly to the axis of the ss433 jets : with negative rms to the west and positive rms to the east .",
    "however , this assessment does not incorporate the contradictory large positive rms to the north / north west of the central region .",
    "nevertheless , the northern portion of the shell has other features that suggest it should not be incorporated in an assessment of any symmetry axis and that this region could have an independently large rm .",
    "these anomalous features include its very high polarized fraction of @xmath21% ( see section  [ radiopolbackground ] ) , which indicates that the northern rim has the most strongly - ordered magnetic fields across the whole object .",
    "furthermore , the linear polarization of the northern rim is coincident with some of the optical filaments  this is the only region in w50 in which this is the case .",
    "these features suggest that this region is dominated by classic compression of an interstellar field by a sn shock that is oriented approximately east  west .",
    "the most consistent interpretation therefore appears to be that there is a symmetry axis running approximately north  south ( although the precise angle of this axis of symmetry is ambiguous ) , with a loop magnetic field that mostly runs east  west in the central region as seen in projection .",
    "this explanation also fits with the known orientation of w50 along the line - of - sight ( with the eastern lobe oriented slightly towards us , and the western lobe directed away from us ) , and with other multiwavelength evidence that implies a preferential east  west axis in w50 ( see section  [ backgroundw50 ] ) . in combination",
    ", this therefore implies that the current magnetic field geometry is predominantly oriented parallel to the axis of the ss433 jets .",
    "furthermore , as the symmetry axis of the rm - gradient in the circular region of w50 may be oriented perpendicularly to the jet - axis of ss433 , this suggests that the central region of w50 is not a distinct object from the jets , and that the central region evolved in tandem with the jet - features .",
    "there must therefore be a strong degree of jet / remnant coupling in the w50/ss433 system , which includes coupling of the respective magnetic fields .    in combination ,",
    "we interpret our data as evidence in favour of a loop magnetic field existing in the shell of w50 , which is oriented almost exactly east  west . in this scenario ,",
    "the polarization from the northern rim probes a separate and distinct region of the shell with a large positive rm .",
    "this would naively appear to provide an intangible three - dimensional magnetic field geometry , however this is only as seen in projection and does not include e.g.  depolarization effects along the line - of - sight .",
    "there is other evidence to suggest the northern rim could be distinct from the rest of the shell  it is brighter in total intensity , and is considerably stronger in linear polarization compared to the rest of the shell .",
    "furthermore , unlike the rest of the shell , the polarization angles in the northern rim are typically noted as a classic case of compression of frozen - in magnetic fields ( see section  [ faradayrotation ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the northern rim being the only region in the w50/ss433 system that has been unmodified by the jets of ss433 , with the northern rim therefore providing an archaeological glimpse into the initial snr that compressed the ambient magnetic field of the surrounding ism .",
    "alternatively , we could invoke the presence of a pre - existing cavity that had been carved out prior to the supernova explosion , i.e.  a stellar - wind bubble , and with the cavity being an ovoid that is preferentially larger along the east  west jet axis .",
    "it is known that an ambient ism magnetic field oriented perpendicularly to the direction of the expansion of a bubble can lead to the formation of an ovoid , rather than spherical bubble .",
    "strong magnetic fields , can even completely stop the expansion of the bubble in the direction perpendicular to the field , leading to the formation of a tube - like bubble .",
    "this effect would have strong consequences on the shape and evolution of nebulae such as w50 , which may have been formed within a main wind - blown bubble . in this case , the supernova shock would then propagate undisturbed through the ovoid cavity , leaving behind a loop magnetic field structure . in the case of the northern rim ,",
    "the shock interacted strongly  compressing the denser ambient ism .",
    "both interpretations clearly require a supernova progenitor , and therefore favour a _ snr+jets model_. in fact , this latter scenario suggests the possibility of a more complex scenario than has typically been considered in the literature , a _",
    "wind+snr+jets model _",
    ", with a stellar - wind bubble driven by the jets of ss433 expanding into a swept - up ism that was itself created either entirely by the jets of ss433 or even by a continuous wind from the ss433 binary , followed by a supernova explosion  with the snr rapidly taking on the dimensions of the wind - blown bubble  and finally an encounter between the jets from ss433 and the already - formed snr , with the ram pressure from the jets ` punching ' through the shell to form the ears .",
    "wind+snr+jets model _ has been partially suggested before @xcite .",
    "this model could reconcile why the snr has been previously interpreted as displaying features consistent with both a wind - blown bubble and a snr .",
    "significant questions remain concerning the association of w50 and ss433 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . while a consensus has emerged that the jets of ss433 have punched holes in a preceding , expanding , supernova shell , the formation of the whole of w50 s structure by ss433 s jets alone has not been completely ruled out ( see section  [ intro ] )",
    "the lack of optical - emitting filaments in the shell of w50 has previously presented a challenge for a supernova origin of the shell ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if the shell is an old snr , then we would expect optical emission from some of the shell filaments , and for optical emission to be observed all along the shell and to trace out the region of radiative cooling of the shock wave in a relatively dense region of the ism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although non - radiative shocks are also seen as faint filaments in the h@xmath1 image of younger snrs such as kepler s snr and rcw  86 @xcite , and ionised h@xmath1 filaments have also been detected in systems such as the orion - eridanus superbubble @xcite .",
    "previously proposed explanations for this discrepancy in w50 are that ( i ) there is a rift of higher extinction crossing the center of w50 @xcite , that could be obscuring any filaments , and ( ii ) alternatively , that the radio emission from a large snr , like w50 , of @xmath149  pc radius would come from the crushing of low - density clouds which would produce only weak optical emission ( as predicted by the model of @xcite ) .",
    "we have resolved this dilemma by identifying weak optical filaments distributed throughout the shell .",
    "we have identified counterparts in the radio morphology for nearly all of the newly - identified optical filaments .",
    "an alignment is known for the brightest optical features at the breakout regions of the shell @xcite , while an alignment between optical and radio filaments in the shell itself would be expected for an old snr . while it could be argued that the newly discovered optical filaments are suggestive of a sn shock ,",
    "this is by no means certain , and it is not possible  using the current data  to directly rule out an origin of the h@xmath1 filaments due to a wind - blown bubble .",
    "nevertheless , the combined weight of the multiwavelength evidence does typically suggest a snr origin @xcite . either way , future studies will be able to use these new filaments to obtain in - depth information on the kinematics of the shell of w50  potentially allowing a definitive experiment to determine how w50 was formed .    in w50 ,",
    "the lack of a detection of an additional , more extensive , network of filamentary nebulosity throughout the shell is consistent with previous deep - images and high - resolution spectroscopy of the northern radio ridge of w50 that suggested that patchy foreground dust along the 5.5  kpc line - of - sight is inhibiting the detection of all of the optical nebulosity associated with w50 @xcite .",
    "our detection of the faintest filaments , in parts of the shell , lend support to a very patchy foreground .",
    "the discovery of a more extensive network of optical filaments lends additional support to the _ snr+jets model _ for the formation of the w50/ss433 system .",
    "however , it does not rule out a mixed - type origin for the nebula , and could also imply a _ wind+snr+jets model _ with a snr expanding in a pre - formed wind - blown bubble ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is also the possibility of most of the expansion of the shell being driven by a wind that follows , rather than precedes , the snr  a _",
    "snr+wind+jets model _",
    "( or perhaps a _ wind+snr+wind+jets model _ as it is not mutually exclusive from there being a pre - existing cavity before the supernova explosion ) . in this scenario ,",
    "a preceding snr left a shell , which was then further inflated by a wind from the binary system , and with the eastern and western regions later being strongly distorted by outflows from the jets .",
    "this potentially better explains the morphology of the filled - centre almost plerion - like central component which has a steep - spectrum interior , however this scenario would appear to be inconsistent with the observed magnetic field structure in the northern rim that differs from the rest of the central region .",
    "what is clear is that the magnetic contributions of the shell and the jets are coupled , and that either ( i ) the field in the shell has helped to form ss433 s axis and to collimate the jets in this direction , ( ii ) the axis of the jets has modified the magnetic fields in the surrounding medium , ( iii ) there is a strong ambient field that has influenced both the intrinsic axes of the shell and the jets , or ( iv ) some combination of the above .",
    "numerical simulations of explosions inside pre - existing wind - driven bubbles , particularly of non - spherical snrs , and predictions of the effect on the observed rm geometry will help substantially in unpicking these various interpretations . while beyond the scope of this paper , demonstrating the application of @xmath61-fitting @xcite to an extended object such as w50 would form a useful future study .",
    "we would require the total intensity short - spacing data in order to perform reliable @xmath61-fitting on our atca data , as we are currently unable to retrieve reliable polarized fractions due to the limited and changing @xmath39-coverage across the very broad band .",
    "future observations would therefore ideally include broadband data from a single - dish in order to recover all of the spatial scales in the object",
    ". nevertheless , @xmath61-fitting should be able to identify separate signatures from the northern rim and the east  west aligned ring - like magnetic field .",
    "this would allow one to test the various scenarios for w50 s formation , although it appears a supernova explosion is likely a necessary feature in the object s evolution .",
    "w50 has implications for how snrs which contain compact objects fit into the overall picture of snr evolution .",
    "the combined evidence of our own and previous observations is consistent with w50 being the reanimated corpse of a shell - like snr , driven back to life by the powerful outflows from its central engine .",
    "this places w50 into a unique class of zombie supernova remnants .",
    "the study of such outflow - dominated objects may provide unique methods in which to identify remnants with massive star progenitors , and may also assist in revealing why the fraction of snrs in which a compact source is identified is much less than that expected by supernovae type alone .",
    "this is doubtlessly partially due to observational selection effects .",
    "nevertheless , future studies of w50 , and other possible zombie snrs , may allow us to begin recognising more subtle signatures that allow the presence of a central source to be inferred rather than directly detected .",
    "an extensive sample of similar zombie remnants are already known , and a number of potential candidates are already visible in the most snr catalogue .",
    "future observations of w50 and these other candidates may therefore be able to help us understand the larger picture of where snrs with compact objects fit on the evolutionary ladder , and to create an even more comprehensive catalogue of similar objects for future study .",
    "observations of similar ununsual large - angular size nebulae are already underway ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the use of facilities such as the atca and the vla will continue to improve upon galactic snr imaging techniques ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is clear that the w50/ss433 system is in a special and unique class of outflow - driven snrs .",
    "using the atca , we have obtained a 198 pointing mosaic of a @xmath150  degree region of the sky surrounding w50 , with continuous radio frequency coverage from 1.4 to 3.1  ghz , and in full - stokes . following rm synthesis , we have obtained a noise level in our faraday cubes of 0.125  mjy  beam@xmath69  rmsf@xmath69 .",
    "this is the most sensitive mosaic of w50 that has been created in linear polarization , and provides an unrivalled view of the large - scale magnetic fields in the radio nebula . to our knowledge , these data are nominally also the most sensitive images of w50 in the radio continuum to date , although we are limited in total intensity by our @xmath39-coverage .",
    "we have found the limitation that the frequency - dependent @xmath39-coverage inherent to ultra broadband radio observations tends to provide an overly steep spectral index of extended sources .",
    "we have complemented our radio data by also creating a large mosaic of iphas continuum - corrected h@xmath1 data , which maps out the ionised gas distribution surrounding the w50/ss433 system  thereby providing a unique multi - wavelength perspective of the object .",
    "our conclusions are summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "we have identified new , faint , optical , filamentary emission across the nebula .",
    "conversely to previous studies , we find optical emission coincident with both the northern shell and the bright radio filaments in the western ear .",
    "we also find additional new filaments within the filled - centre of the w50 nebula . unlike previously discovered filaments that are most likely associated with breakout regions from the microquasar jets , the newly discovered faint filaments are most consistent with being associated with the initial snr shell itself .",
    "all of these optical filaments are either directly traced out , or have a nearby filamentary counterpart , in the radio continuum image of w50 .",
    "2 .   we have mapped the linearly polarized radio emission across the nebula . unlike the radio continuum data",
    ", the linear radio polarization appears to be largely independent of the brightest optical filaments . nevertheless , the polarization is coincident with some of the fainter filaments in the northern ridge  also consistent with classic field compression by a supernova shock .",
    "the linear radio polarization also shows a strong anti - correlation with the surrounding diffuse h@xmath1 emission , demonstrating that the foreground ionised gas traced by the h@xmath1 emission is depolarizing the observed emission due to spatially - varying faraday rotation fluctuations across the face of the radio nebula .",
    "the simultaneous depolarization of both w50 and the galactic polarized emission indicates that these clouds of thermal electrons must be located in the foreground of w50/ss433 .",
    "the structure of the faraday foreground towards w50 is complicated and features many large - scale changes of sign of the magnetic field  both in the plane of the sky ( as traced by the rm from linearly polarized emission ) and along the line - of - sight ( as traced by the rm and dm of nearby pulsars ) .",
    "as the median foreground rm towards the nebula is consistent with @xmath142  rad  m@xmath3 , the pattern of rms across w50 appears to be best described by a loop magnetic field surrounding the central region itself .",
    "the symmetry axis of this loop - field is oriented perpendicularly to , and appears to be connected to , the symmetry axis of the jets / ears  suggesting that both the shell and the ears are related and dependent phenomena . the evolution of magnetic fields in both the jet and remnant components of the w50/ss433 system must be intertwined .",
    "the faraday rotation data suggest that there is a ring - like magnetic field that is threaded through the termination shock associated with the eastern ear , at the location where the shock of the jet interacts with the circumstellar medium .",
    "this is consistent with the ring - like structure previously inferred by x - ray observations .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the enhanced radio and x - ray emitting eastern ear structure is possibly similar to a hotspot in frii radio galaxies that are also the physical manifestation of a jet - termination shock .",
    "thus w50 , and similar objects of its zombie class , present a unique opportunity to study structures similar to hotspots using galactic jets . curiously , a similar magnetic field structure to that seen in w50 s eastern ear has also been implicated in the magnetic field structure of jets from active galactic nuclei ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this further suggests that investigations of the magnetic field structure using tools such as @xmath61-fitting , will be important in unravelling the full faraday structure along the line - of - sight towards galactic supernova remnants .",
    "in particular , future radio observations with for example the square kilometre array ( ska ) will allow us to learn about magnetic field structures in snrs through detection of the emission itself , and through a background grid of polarized sources , due to the vast increase in the available sample size @xcite .",
    "such studies will help us further understand the ism itself and features such as snrs , and to therefore refine and remove our estimates for the galactic foreground for a large number of extragalactic studies .",
    "we thank martin bell , ilana feain , and craig anderson for useful discussions during the preparation of this project , and janet drew and nick wright for discussions on mosaicing data from the iphas survey .",
    "we are also grateful to naomi mcclure - griffiths for helpful advice on observing with the atca .",

    "there is a clear difference between the 3.1  ghz and 2.2  ghz distributions of polarized emission , with the 3.1  ghz distribution reaching out to a larger radius from ss433 and consistent with w50 being a magnetised spherical structure . at lower frequencies , the depolarization effects are more considerable",

    "[ figrgb ] . the optical filament coincides with the edge of a bright peak in the linearly polarized emission .",

    "are the bright optical filaments associated with the eastern breakout region and which were discussed in section  [ 1stregion ] . from the east , there are several fainter h@xmath1 filaments that appear to stretch inwards towards the interior of the radio nebula . the largest two of these filaments are oriented approximately along the east  west axis , and become increasingly wispy towards the east ( possibly implying that they are associated with the jets of ss433 ) . of these two larger filaments , the brighter one to the north will be referred to as filament ` a ' , and the fainter one to the south will be referred to as filament ` b ' .",
    "filament a has a direct radio continuum counterpart .",
    "this radio counterpart is a linear filamentary feature and appears to be offset very slightly so that the emission originates along the southern edge of the h@xmath1 emission .",
    "while filament b has no obvious radio counterpart , to the west there is an associated linear radio feature leading directly between the end of the h@xmath1 filament and that terminates at ss433 itself .",

    "the implication is that this filamentary feature traces the magnetic field lines .",
    "the lack of optical emission near to ss433 and the abruptness of the transition is consistent with the inferred patchy absorption @xcite . for only the western edge of the filament to be bright in radio continuum",
    "suggests that the charged particles in the eastern edge are : either being swept - away so as not being constantly replenished ( although ram - pressure stripping would also leave an imprint on the h@xmath1 filament ) , or that the magnetic field is increasingly ordered further from ss433 such that incident electrons are expelled before they are able to significantly contribute to the synchrotron emission , in a manner similar to that theorised for linear radio filaments near to the galactic centre @xcite .",
    "this would imply that either the filament rapidly transitions to a region that contains a very strong magnetic field , on the order of 100  @xmath124 g , or that the filaments are possibly aligned as seen in projection .    in linear radio polarization ,",
    "both filament a and b appear to be depolarizing the diffuse polarized emission from the radio nebula , with even the small extension to the north - west from filament a having a possibly offset counterpart in the radio polarization .",
    "note the very different intrinsic angular resolution of both the radio polarization and h@xmath1 data .",
    "this implies that the filaments depolarize the radio shell , and so the filaments must be located in the foreground of the magnetoionic layer in the shell from which the polarization is being emitted .",
    "this possibly suggests that the polarization in this region emanates from the rear - side of the shell at higher - frequencies .",
    "the brightest radio polarization throughout the region is dominated by the emission in the northern and northwestern rim as discussed in sections  [ 5thregion ] and [ 6thregion ] .",

    "these filaments are located at the northern edge of the radio nebula , and trace out the periphery of w50 .",
    "the filament at the bottom of the region very approximately traces out a boundary where the radio continuum rapidly increases in brightness , however the filament is offset at an angle unrelated to the radio emission , and we interpret the approximate alignment as likely being coincidental . at the noisiest levels of the image , there is a very faint tentative indication of a possible bridge filament that links the parallel filaments with the filament further to the south .    in radio polarization ,",

    "optical filamentary emission clearly traces out the rim between the edge of the radio continuum emission and the surrounding ambient medium , and additional diffuse optical emission is coincident along the entire eastern part of the radio shell .",
    "no linearly polarized radio emission is associated with g38.71.4 at these sensitivity levels .",
    "as the supernova remnant is completely depolarized across the entire atca band , the depolarization could be associated with the h@xmath1 emission itself , or alternatively , g38.71.4 could be depolarized due to bandwidth depolarization  which would imply a very high rm@xmath551,997  rad  m@xmath3 ( see section  [ imaging ] ) .",
