    "collective excitations at metal surfaces ( surface plasmons , sp )  @xcite are well known to play a key role in a wide spectrum of science , ranging from physics and materials science to biology.@xcite here we focus on one specific situation where surface plasmons play a key role : the energy loss of charged particles moving near a metal surface .",
    "this work has been partially motivated by recent theoretical and experimental studies of the interaction of highly charged ions@xcite with the internal surface of microcapillaries and nanocapillaries ,  @xcite whose interpretation calls for an understanding of the asymptotic behaviour of the energy loss at large distances from the surface .",
    "our _ ab initio _ calculations of the electronic energy loss of charged particles moving outside a magnesium surface indicate that the finite width of the sp resonance , which is mainly due to the presence of band - structure effects ,  @xcite strongly modifies this asymptotic behaviour .",
    "when a charged particle is placed in front of a metal surface , the distribution of electrons in the surface and the bulk is modified , an induced charged density is built up , and both single - particle and collective excitations are created which are ultimately responsible for the electronic energy loss of the external charged particle . moving charged particles can also lose energy as a result of the interaction with the nuclei of the solid ; however , this energy loss is negligible compared to the electronic energy loss , unless the probe charge moves at velocities that are extremely small compared to the fermi velocity @xmath0 of the solid .    for a weak interaction between the external charged particle and the electrons of the metal surface",
    ", the electronic response can be treated within linear - response theory . in the case of charged particles moving inside a solid",
    ", nonlinear effects are known to be crucial in the interpretation of energy - loss measurements ;  @xcite however , nonlinear corrections have been shown to be less important when the charged particle moves outside the solid .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , the electronic response of the metal surface is expected to be strongly dependent upon the actual structure of the ground - state electron density .",
    "therefore , an accurate description of the electronic energy loss of charged particles moving near a metal surface lies mainly in the understanding of two basic ingredients : the electronic properties of the ground state of the target and the linear response of a many - electron system to external perturbations .",
    "existing self - consistent calculations of the energy - loss spectra at solid surfaces are based on either the jellium model  @xcite or a one - dimensional ( 1d ) model potential that still assumes translational invariance along the surface .",
    "@xcite here we report the first three - dimensional ( 3d ) _ ab initio _ calculation of the electronic energy loss that incorporates the full band structure of the solid surface . specifically , we calculate from first principles the energy loss of charged particles that move parallel to the ( 0001 ) surface of mg .",
    "we use the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) ,  @xcite and we focus on the limit in which the moving particle travels at large distances ( compared to the fermi wavelength ) from the surface .",
    "we demonstrate that even for a free - electron - like metal such as mg band - structure effects on the finite width of the sp resonance strongly modify this asymptotic behaviour .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "we derive the surface - response function of the system , whose imaginary part is related to the rate at which an external potential generates electronic excitations at the solid surface . in sec .",
    "iii , we derive an explicit expression for the electronic energy loss of charged particles moving parallel to a solid surface ( stopping power of the solid ) , which we obtain from the knowledge of the imaginary part of the @xmath1 self - energy of many - body theory .",
    "@xcite in sec .",
    "iv , we present numerical calculations of the surface - response function and the electronic stopping power of a mg(0001 ) surface .",
    "we compare our results with the stopping power obtained with the use of either the jellium model or a 1d model potential . in sec .",

    "in the case of a periodic surface , we introduce 2d fourier expansions of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a normalization area , @xmath16 is a 2d wave - vector in the surface brillouin zone ( sbz ) , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote 2d reciprocal lattice vectors . for an external potential of the form",

    "( [ eloss ] ) ] yields the rate at which an external potential generates electronic excitations . equation  ( [ sres ] ) shows that only the diagonal fourier coefficient @xmath40 with @xmath41 enters the expression for the surface - response function .",

    "this figure shows that for the small values of @xmath109 considered here both jellium and 1d model calculations ( dashed and thin solid curves ) overestimate the sp energy ; our calculations show , however , that for larger values of the 2d wave vector these simplified models predict accurate values of the sp energy .    the important message of fig .  [ img ]",
    "is that at small values of @xmath109 the actual linewidth of the sp is considerably larger than that obtained with the use of 1d jellium - like models .",

    "( [ eq30 ] ) ( which assumes the linewidth of the surface plasmon to be zero ) decays exponentially ; indeed , at these large distances from the surface the stopping power is dominated by the finite intrinsic linewidth of the surface plasmon , leading to a ratio that increases exponentially .",
    "this exponential increase also occurs when the stopping power of the real surface is replaced by that of a semi - infinite electron gas described by a drude dielectric function of the form @xmath114 , @xmath115 being a damping parameter that would give account approximately for the finite surface - plasmon linewidth .",
    "we have carried out first - principles self - consistent calculations of the surface - response matrix and the stopping power of the ( 0001 ) surface of mg .",
    "our results indicate that band - structure effects ( and , in particular , interband transitions ) play a key role in the description of the asymptotic behaviour of the stopping power far from the surface , even in the case of a free - electron - like metal such us mg . in particular , we find that the linewidth of the surface - response function is considerably enhanced at small wave vectors , which yields an increased energy loss of charged particles moving far from the surface that can not be described by simplified 1d jellium - like models . this important effect , which should be present in the case of all metal surfaces , is expected to be relevant for the understanding of the interaction between charged particles and the internal surface of microcapillaries .",
