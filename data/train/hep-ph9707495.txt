    "in 1978 , lutz and rybicki showed@xcite that almost complete amplitude analysis of reactions @xmath21 and @xmath22 is possible from measurements in a single experiment on a transversely polarized target .",
    "more recently it was shown@xcite that amplitude analyses of reactions @xmath23 and @xmath24 are also possible from measurements on transversely polarized target .",
    "the work of lutz and rybicki opened a whole new approach to hadron spectroscopy by enabling to study the production of resonances on the level of spin amplitudes rather than spin - averaged cross - sections .    in amplitude analyses of these reactions resonances",
    "are observed in mass distribution of recoil nucleon transversity amplitudes @xmath25 and @xmath26 corresponding to recoil nucleon spin `` up '' or `` down '' relative to the scattering plane . in traditional hadron spectroscopy ,",
    "the nucleon spin is irrelevant and resonance should appear in both spin amplitudes with the same mass , with the same width and with similar mass distributions .",
    "the measurements of reactions @xmath0 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 at cern on polarized targets seem to challenge these expectations .",
    "these cern experiments reveal shapes of resonant mass distributions in amplitudes of opposite transversity that are different and dependent significantly on the nucleon spin@xcite .",
    "an important advantage of amplitude analyses is that new resonances can be detected on the level of spin amplitude that are not visible in the spin - averaged measurements on unpolarized targets .",
    "such is the case of the new scalar resonance @xmath2 found in amplitude analyses of reactions @xmath29 at 17.2 gev / c at low momentum transfers @xmath30 0.0050.2 ( gev / c)@xmath31 and in @xmath32 at 5.98 and 11.85 gev / c at larger momentum transfers @xmath33 0.20.4 ( gev / c)@xmath31@xcite .",
    "using monte carlo method of amplitude analysis , it was found in @xcite that in @xmath34 reaction both solutions for spin `` up '' @xmath3-wave amplitude @xmath4 resonate below 880 mev while both solutions for spin `` down '' @xmath3-wave amplitude @xmath5 appeared nonresonating .",
    "this result is in perfect agreement with @xmath6 minimization method of amplitude analysis used in @xcite ( see fig .  1 and 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "detailed quantitative breit - wigner fits to @xmath4 in @xcite showed the importance of coherent background for determination of the resonance parameters of @xmath2 .",
    "the best fit in @xcite gives @xmath35 mev and @xmath36 mev .",
    "the excellent agreement of these values for @xmath37 and @xmath9 with the ellis - lanik theorem@xcite strongly suggests that @xmath2 is the lowest mass scalar gluonium@xcite .",
    "trnqvist expressed concern@xcite that the low mass and the narrow width of @xmath2 is due to the neglect of interference of @xmath2 with @xmath38 ( 980 ) in our breit - wigner fits which initially extended only to 880 mev in dipion mass using the data set of ref .",
    "the apparent nonresonating behaviour of the amplitude @xmath5 below 880 mev was also puzzling .",
    "to investigate these questions we have performed a new amplitude analysis of @xmath39 reaction at 17.2 gev / c and small momentum transfers @xmath330.0050.20 ( gev / c)@xmath31 extending the dipion mass range up to 1080 mev using the data set of ref .  [ 7 ] .    in this report",
    "we present the results of our detailed study of resonant structure of @xmath3-wave amplitudes @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the mass region of 5801080 mev .",
    "this work is the first attempt to determine resonance parameters of a resonance from fits to production amplitudes of opposite nucleon transversity .",
    "all previous determinations of resonance parameters used spin - averaged mass distributions or , in the case of ref .  [ 18 ] , only one spin amplitude @xmath40 .",
    "the new results for @xmath4 shows a narrow resonance below 880 mev , followed by an enhancement above 900 mev and a dramatic dip at @xmath411000 mev corresponding to @xmath1 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath5 shows a broader structure with a dip at @xmath411000 mev .",
    "first we performed separate fits to @xmath4 and @xmath42 using a coherent sum of @xmath2 and @xmath1 breit - wigner amplitudes and constant background .",
    "we find that @xmath8 contributes to both amplitudes but with different widths .",
    "solutions 1 and 2 of amplitude @xmath4 have a narrow width of 100 and 76 mev , respectively .",
    "solutions 1 and 2 of amplitude @xmath5 have a broader width of 217 and 233 mev . the interference with @xmath1 is crucial in reproducing the enhancements above 900 mev and the dip at 1010 mev .    the narrow width in the spin `` up '' amplitude @xmath43 and the broad width in the spin `` down '' amplitude @xmath5 is inconsistent with the traditional view of a resonace as a particle with single mass and width . to see",
    "if we can describe the mass spectra of @xmath4 and @xmath5 with a single @xmath8 with the same resonance parameters , we have performed a simultaneous fit to @xmath43 and @xmath5 hoping that the differences in the resonant shapes can be accounted for by differences in the background .",
    "we obtained an acceptable fit but the @xmath6 per data point @xmath7 was significantly higher than @xmath12 in separate fits .",
    "we thus obtained a poorer fit .",
    "our next step was to admit that a narrow @xmath8 contributes to @xmath4 and a broad @xmath8 contributes to @xmath5 .",
    "but a self - consistency requires that the narrow @xmath8 contributes also to @xmath5 , and the broad @xmath8 contributes also to @xmath4 .",
    "we expected these additional contributions to be small in a simultaneous two - pole fit to @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the results of the fit were surprising .",
    "our best fit had @xmath12 better than the separate fits to @xmath4 and @xmath5 . and the fit required in all amplitudes the presence of two @xmath8 resonances : higher mass and broader @xmath8 with average mass @xmath44 mev and @xmath45 , and a lower mass and narrower @xmath15 with average mass of @xmath16 mev and @xmath46 mev . in",
    "all @xmath3-wave amplitudes the higher mass @xmath8 dominates the @xmath15 contribution .",
    "since this solution gives a very low @xmath12 , it must be taken seriously .",
    "we propose to identify the @xmath18 and @xmath19 as color electric and color magnetic modes of lowest mass scalar gluonium @xmath20 , respectively , following the gluonium classification scheme of bjorken@xcite elaborated in@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present and discuss the results of our new amplitude analysis . in section iii",
    "we introduce the parametrization of unnormalized @xmath3-wave amplitudes with a single @xmath8 pole and present the results of separate fits to amplitudes @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "simultaneous fits to these @xmath3-wave amplitudes using a single @xmath8 pole are presented in section iv . in section",
    "v we introduce the parametrization with two @xmath8 poles and discuss the results of simultaneous fits to @xmath4 and @xmath5 using this parametrization . in section vi we discuss the possible constituent nature of the two @xmath8 states @xmath18 and @xmath19 resulting from the best fit .",
    "the paper closes with a summary in section vii .",
