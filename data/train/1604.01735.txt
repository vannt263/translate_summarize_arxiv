    "the plasma may contain different charged species as well as free electrons .",
    "these charged particles can screen the atomic potential of the embedded atomic systems resulting deviations in the structures of the systems from their corresponding isolated systems .",
    "first principle calculations of electronic structures of the plasma embedded atomic systems are extremely strenuous due to complexity involved in the description of the coulomb potentials .",
    "thus , to describe their structures conveniently , model atomic potentials are used which account for the plasma screening effects .",
    "the plasma environment can be classified into weakly and strongly coupled plasma depending on the strength of its coupling constant @xmath0 , which is the ratio of the coulomb potential energy to the thermal energy . for weakly coupled plasma ( @xmath0 @xmath1 1 ; i.e. low density and high temperature )",
    ", the screening effect can be appropriately described using the debye model @xcite . however , in the strongly coupled plasma ( @xmath0 @xmath2 1 implying high density and low temperature ) ion - sphere ( is ) potential model @xcite is the best suited model for accounting the plasma screening effects .",
    "both the debye and ion - sphere models have been successfully employed several times earlier to describe the electronic properties of different plasma embedded atomic systems @xcite .",
    "the effect of nuclear charge screening by plasma free electrons is reciprocated in form of ionization potential depression ( ipd ) or continuum lowering @xcite .",
    "other crucial spectral properties of atomic systems that are of immense interest are excitation energies ( ees ) , spectral line shifts , line broadenings , energy level crossings etc .",
    "accurate knowledge of these quantities is essential in describing equation of state of plasma @xcite , finding out opacity of an element in the astrophysical plasma @xcite , in understanding dynamics of atomic systems in the laser cooling and trapping of ions @xcite , inertial confinement fusion studies @xcite etc .",

    "the strongly coupled plasma is mostly seen in the highly evolved stars , interior of the jovian planets , explosive shock tubes , laser produced plasma and inertial confinement fusion plasmas @xcite .",
    "most of these studies have been carried out in the debye model formalism .",
    "however , there has been no theoretical investigation of the strongly coupled al - plasma carried out in the is model framework .",
    "nevertheless , it appears from a large number of studies that probing structures of al - plasma are of ample interest to both the experimentalists and theoreticians working in this field .",
    "the primary interest of the present work is to carry out an _ ab initio _ investigation of electronic structures of al and some of its ions in both weakly and strongly coupled plasma environment . in most of the previous studies the electronic structures of al plasma",
    "have been investigated using many - body methods which account for the electron correlation effects inefficiently .",
    "accurate calculations in the atomic systems with more than four electrons require a many - body method that is capable of including electron correlation effects rigorously .",
    "again , the relativistic effects in these ions are usually large . in this work ,",
    "we employ a relativistic coupled - cluster ( rcc ) method to carry out the theoretical investigations in the considered atomic systems .",
    "the rcc method is an all order perturbative method that obeys the size extensivity and size consistent behavior @xcite . in weakly coupled plasma",
    ", we consider the debye - screened potential instead of the usual atomic potential in the rcc method to describe the change in the spectroscopic properties of the plasma embedded al ions . in the approach ,",
    "in which , the screening effect is taken into account only through the nuclear potential is referred to as the spherical debye ( sd ) potential approximation . however",
    ", plasma free electrons may also play an important role in the screening of bound electron - electron interaction term in the potential .",
    "the approach in which both nuclear and electronic charge screenings are considered explicitly is denoted as non - spherical debye ( nsd ) potential approximation .",
    "owing to the complexity in the consideration of the nsd potential approximation in a perturbative approach , this is rarely applied in the investigation of electronic structure of the plasma embedded atomic systems .",
    "the sd potential approximation may provide reasonably accurate results in the h - like , he - like and li - like atomic systems , where there are not many electrons present .",
    "however , it has been found that consideration of nsd potential approximation can lead to very interesting results in the evaluations of the orbital energies and transition probabilities in the plasma embedded atomic systems @xcite .",
    "recently , gutierrez _ et al _ @xcite had also shown that nsd potential gives rise large collision strengths compared to the sd potential approximation . in this work",
    ", we intend to make a comparative analysis of results considering both the sd and nsd potentials through our rcc method .",
    "similarly , the effect of the strongly coupled plasma environment on the atomic structure of al ions is being investigated by considering the is potential in the rcc method .",
    "again , we consider few cases with the given experimental conditions of plasma and investigate ipds and ees of the al iii and al xi ions in both the nsd potential approximation of the debye model and the is model to make a comparative analysis of the results obtained from these models .",

    "a comparison among the results from these two approximations can demonstrate role of plasma screening through the electron - electron correlation effects in the considered systems . to examine this , we vary the @xmath15 value from 5.0 a.u . to 100 a.u . in al i , from 3 a.u . to 100 a.u . in al iii , from 0.6 a.u . to 13.6 a.u . in al ix , and from 0.5 a.u . to 13.6 a.u . in al xi . in fig .",

    "as expected , the ips decrease smoothly with decrease in the @xmath15 value in all the systems ; this is one of the unique properties of the plasma embedded atomic systems @xcite .",

    "in al i , the results from both the approximations are differing substantially implying it is imperative to include electron correlation effects accurately in the many - electron systems .",
    "it can also be noticed from the results that the differences in al i and al iii are slightly larger for the intermediate range of @xmath15 .",
    "this may be because of the fact that with the increase of screening effect , the electrons become more relaxed at the intermediate values of @xmath15 . when the @xmath15 value is increased further , the electrons start seeing stronger plasma screening effects through the nuclear potential . hence , for the large @xmath15 values the differences between the ips gradually decrease in both the sd and nsd potential approximations . to get a quantitative realization of variation of ips with the @xmath15 values ,",
    "we quote ips of all the considered ions for some selective values of @xmath15 in table [ tab1 ] using both the sd and nsd potential approximations . differences between the results from both the approximations have been given as @xmath45ip in the same table .",

    "width=317,height=253 ]    to understand the variation in the excitation energies of plasma embedded ions , we also investigate variation in the first excited state energies of the al i , al iii , al ix and al xi ions , with the debye length . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we have plotted them against the @xmath15 values considering both the sd and nsd potential approximations .",
    "one can infer from this figure that the ees of the excited states in the plasma embedded al systems decrease with decreasing values of @xmath15 except in the al xi ion .",
    "we find the situation is quite different in the al xi ion , where the ee of the @xmath46 state increases with the increasing screening strength .",
    "however at very high screening region , this ee starts decreasing at some critical @xmath15 value in the sd approximation .",
    "this behavior was also seen in the hydrogen - like ions @xcite and lithium - like ions @xcite in the debye model studies . where as in the nsd potential approximation , this behavior disappears .",
    "therefore , it implies that the use of nsd potential in the debye model reduces the electron - electron screening effects that are overestimated in the sd model approximation in the systems having many electrons .",
    "thus , it demonstrates importance of accounting the plasma screening effects through the two - body interaction term in the many - electron systems accurately .",
    "another aspect can be observed from the analysis of ees in the considered systems is that the differences between the ees obtained using the sd and nsd potential approximations are larger than their ips , as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "this means that the screening effects affect the ground and the excited states differently .      here",
    ", we proceed presenting results from the is model by carrying out the calculations using the rcc method .",
    "these results are supposed to explain the systems in the strong coupling plasma environment . in fig .",

    "from the plot we can see that the ips decrease monotonically with decreasing the ion sphere radius @xmath47 .",

    "the variation of the ee of the @xmath49 state in the al iii ion with is radius shows very peculiar result as shown in fig .",
    "initially , the ees of the @xmath50 states decrease with decreasing value of is radius , then they suddenly rise at certain critical values of @xmath47 .",
