    "the search for the quark - gluon - plasma ( qgp ) requires a detailed and quantitative understanding of the influence of known physics on the particle spectra and abundances from heavy ion collisions , such that possible systematic deviations due to the new physics of the qgp can be recognized in the experimental data .",
    "when interpreting the pion momentum spectra @xcite-@xcite the question of entropy production during freeze - out occurred @xcite .",
    "if the contribution to entropy production after freeze - out due to resonance decays is known , the entropy of the system before freeze - out can be calculated by measuring the multiplicities and momentum spectra of all particles after freeze - out and combining these data with an estimate of their initial spatial distribution ( e.g. from a fireball model ) .",
    "it is then crucial to know how much entropy is produced in an expanding system during the transition ( freeze - out ) from a highly interacting ( equilibrium ) state to a non - interacting one . here",
    "we will give such an estimate for a simple system of pions and @xmath0 mesons , using the framework of relativistic kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "this will enable us to estimate the reliability of models based on hydrodynamics in which freeze - out is usually implemented by cutting off the entropy - conserving expansion sharply at the so - called freeze - out surface , neglecting possible entropy production during the decoupling process or afterwards by the decay of unstable resonances .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ kin ] we will formulate via relativistic kinetic theory the problem of resonance formation and decay for a system of pions and @xmath0 mesons , including bose statistical effects .",
    "we will show that the collision term satisfies boltzmann s h - theorem and discuss the formation and decay rates for @xmath0 mesons . in section [ sim ]",
    "we describe a simulation of the kinetic equations of our system with the help of a cascade code , and in section [ res ] we present our results , in particular on the production of entropy by resonance formation and decays .",
    "we will also discuss the influence of the interplay between @xmath0-formation and -decay on the time evolution of the particle spectra . in section [ con ]",
    "we summarize our results .",
    "some technical details are given in the appendix .",
    "in the following we will use natural units , @xmath1 , if not stated explicitly otherwise .",
    "as a starting point we consider the kinetic equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the proper - time of a particle at point @xmath5 with momentum @xmath6 , and the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ kinequ ] ) is the collision term .",
    "the latter consists of a term for particle loss ( with rate @xmath7 ) and one for particle gain ( with rate @xmath8 ) .",
    "a vanishing collision term means vanishing entropy production ( liouville theorem ) .",

    "after this freeze - out we expect the dominant physical process to be the decay of the unstable @xmath0 mesons which we want to describe by kinetic theory .",
    "but in order for such a description to be consistent and the calculation of entropy production to be meaningful , our collision term should allow for detailed balance , which implies that we also have to include the inverse process @xmath14 ( resonant @xmath13 scattering ) , however small its rate should be .",

    "even for an initial temperature of @xmath111 = 200 mev , where at the beginning nearly 30% of all particles are @xmath0 mesons ( see table  [ tabgleichgewicht ] ) , the total increase in entropy is only 4% of the initial value . including the re - scattering processes leads to a somewhat larger entropy increase , by up to 15% at @xmath117 mev .",
    "one sees from the numbers that in general the re - scattering processes are much more efficient in producing entropy than the decays . but",
    "even at the highest temperatures investigated in this work the entropy increase is modest ; for systems which are initialized near freeze - out ( @xmath118 mev , see table  [ meanfreepath ] ) it is well below 10% .",
    "this implies that , as far as calculating the entropy balance from the final particle distributions is concerned @xcite , the fact that freeze - out is not a sudden process can be safely ignored .",
    "we presented a cascade simulation with thermal equilibrium initial conditions for the kinetic evolution of the @xmath2-@xmath0-system .",
    "this work was motivated by an earlier investigation of the influence of resonance decays on the entropy balance in relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite which did not take into account that particle freeze - out is a continuous rather than a sudden process .",
    "we have answered the question to what extent additional entropy can be created during the final kinetic evolution between the time when local thermal equilibrium is first broken and the time when finally all resonances have decayed .",
    "we found that this additional amount of entropy is very small , less than about 10% of the entropy already present at the beginning of decoupling .",
    "we also found that this additional entropy production is dominated by the resonant re - scattering between the pions in the system rather than by the resonance decay itself .",
    "the entropy saturates once the system is so dilute that re - scattering events become unlikely .",
    "our simulations took into account the bose statistics of the mesons , and we checked that our collision term satisfies boltzmann s h - theorem and eventually leads to bose equilibrium distributions if the matter is not allowed to expand .",
    "we realized , however , that in the calculation of the collision rates medium corrections by stimulated emission were very small . consequently the influence of bose statistics on the kinetics and dynamics of the expanding system turned out to be negligible .",
    "we also found that the final pion single particle spectra resulting from the kinetic simulation can be very well approximated by the initial thermal pion distribution plus a contribution of pions from the decay of @xmath0 mesons with a thermal momentum distribution with the same initial temperature .",
    "in other words , the modifications of the spectral shape from the final kinetic evolution of the @xmath2-@xmath0-system , in particular the effects of pion re - scattering into @xmath0-mesons , are minor .",
    "thus the usual method @xcite of calculating the resonance decay contributions to the pion spectrum in the `` sudden approximation '' , i.e. without considering the detailed kinetic balance between decays and re - scattering , is a good approximation and quantitatively quite accurate .",
    "this is certainly good news for practitioner because it means that for a thermo- and hydrodynamic analysis of measured hadron spectra the large numerical efforts of a detailed kinetic treatment of the freeze - out stage are not necessary .",
    "in the course of our investigations we also discovered a number of other interesting aspects of our system .",
    "it is well known that in a thermalized system the @xmath0 mass spectrum is shifted towards lower masses compared to the vacuum case , due to the weighting with the exponential thermal bose distribution ( see eq .",
    "( [ normrho ] ) ) .",
    "however , during the time evolution we observed a further downward shift in the mass peak due to the mass dependent decay rate .",
    "this effect simulates very efficiently an increasingly cooler environment for the @xmath0 mesons as time goes on .",
    "* acknowlegdement : * we thank p. koch - steinheimer for stimulating discussion and constructive advice during the initial stages of this work .",

    "this work was supported by dfg , gsi and bmbf .",
    "for a system with spherically symmetric initial conditions in @xmath84 and @xmath83 we show by formal integration over the global time parameter @xmath4 that the kinetic equations conserve the symmetry .    from the kinetic equations we obtain formally at time @xmath119 @xmath120      \\delta\\tau\\ , ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath121      \\delta\\tau \\ , ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where",
    "@xmath122 is short for @xmath123 and @xmath124    with the above mentioned spherically symmetric initial conditions in space it follows immediately that @xmath104 remains a function of only @xmath125 for all times . to prove the same for the momentum dependence we have to show that the momentum integrations yield a result which is independent of the direction of @xmath126 .",
    "but the @xmath127-dependent distribution functions @xmath128 and @xmath129 as well as the momentum independent matrix element ( [ matrixelement2 ] ) can be pulled out of the integrals , and the the remaining integrations are completely independent of @xmath127 .",
