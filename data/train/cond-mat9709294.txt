    "one of the main issues in colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) manganites ( la,@xmath3)mno@xmath2 is to determine the appropriate model to understand the mechanism of its magneto - transport phenomena .",

    "transport properties in de systems are recently studied in a controlled manner using the dynamical mean - field approach by one of the authors @xcite .    another candidate model for cmr manganites",

    "the relevance of the model is to compare universal behaviors insensitive to parametrization , such as scaling relations , with experimental results .",

    "this is the reason for observation of spin wave collective mode throughout the brillouin zone in the low temperature regime even though the system is metallic .",
    "however , at finite temperature with unsaturated spin moment , the density of states splits into two subbands @xcite and there appear low energy stoner processes which damp the spin wave modes . in fig .",
    "[ figstoner ] we schematically illustrate the stoner processes at the ground state and at finite temperature",
    ".    =    low energy part of the stoner excitation is produced by the process of occupied electron excited into unoccupied state with opposite spin species . by counting density of states available for the process",
    "we see @xmath73 at @xmath74 . as for temperature dependence , density of state change by temperature in the way that the majority band has the weight @xmath75 and the minority band @xmath76 , which is the weight for the initial and final state of stoner processes , respectively .",
    "thus the stoner absorption is scaled in the form @xmath77 .    in the presence of strong electron - lattice coupling such as jahn - teller mode , there should exist strong magnon damping processes .",
    "presence of such strong damping is inconsistent with the experimental fact for ( la , pb)mno@xmath2 that spin wave excitation spectrum is well - defined throughout the brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "strong damping effect also cause the deviation from the scaling form ( [ scalingfunction ] ) .",
    "thus , as long as spin wave excitation spectrum in relatively wide band compounds are concerned , electron - lattice couplings does not seem to be so strong as to affect magnon damping effects .",
    "to summarize , we studied the spin wave lifetime of the cmr systems , theoretically by dynamical mean - field approach for the de model and experimentally by neutron inelastic scattering of ( ( la , y),sr)mno@xmath2 . scaling relations in the spin wave lifetime of de model as well as cmr manganites is consistent with each other .",
