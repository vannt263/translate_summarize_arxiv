    "one of the main results of this paper is a regularity theorem which extends an earlier result of phillips @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the extension is reasonably straightforward .",
    "it can be used to rule out the possibility that a non - trivial ( i.e. , non - affine ) one - homogeneous function can be a stationary point of a functional such as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is strongly rank - one convex in the gradient argument , sufficiently regular in the spatial variable @xmath0 in a two - dimensional domain @xmath4 containing zero as an interior point . here , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 .",
    "the second and more substantial part of the paper is devoted to finding circumstances under which the extended version of phillips s result fails .",
    "this involves proving the existence of a non - trivial one - homogeneous solution to an elliptic system which violates at least one of the hypotheses of the theorem .",
    "the resulting function is @xmath1 but not lipschitz , and it has an interesting topological effect on its domain of definition .",
    "it is not a solution of the euler - lagrange equation associated with the functional it minimizes , but it does solve the so - called equilibrium equations .",
    "see sections [ francois ] - [ vivaldi ] for more details .    several examples of non - smooth minimizers of functionals such as , though with an @xmath7independent integrand , are based on positively one - homogeneous functions : see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this is the main reason for our interest in one - homogeneous solutions of elliptic systems . for an overview of the example",
    "@xcite and other singular solutions to elliptic systems see @xcite .",
    "it is perhaps worth pointing out that de giorgi s example @xcite of a singular minimizer is set in three space dimensions and is based on a functional of the form , although the minimizer he constructs is not one - homogeneous .",
    "all examples cited here are set in dimensions strictly larger than two . in two and higher dimensions @xcite and @xcite have shown that stationary points can in general be nowhere @xmath8 .",
    "however , the question of the regularity of minimizers in two dimensions is still open .",
    "this is the motivation for our study of the functional above . in order to rule out certain classes of singular solutions , such as the one - homogeneous solutions considered here , it is sufficient to show that they can not be stationary points of @xmath9 . together with @xcite ,",
    "this argument can be applied to the functionals appearing in @xcite , with the result that none is strongly elliptic .",
    "we remark that the theorem in this note and that of @xcite are also of interest because they yield smoothness in a case not covered by the regularity theory of elliptic manifolds @xcite .",
    "this is possibly why one - homogeneous functions often feature in counterexamples : their tangent spaces are suitably ` degenerate ' .",
    "recall that a function @xmath10 is positively one - homogeneous ( henceforth one - homogeneous ) if , for each @xmath0 in @xmath11 , @xmath12 it follows that any one - homogeneous function : @xmath13 can be represented as @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the boundary of the unit ball in @xmath11 .",

    "replacing @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively with @xmath40 and @xmath41 on the left , and @xmath42 with @xmath43 on the right , leads to the usual definition of strong convexity for @xmath34 .",
    "other , standard notation includes @xmath44 for the norm on the sobolev space @xmath45 , @xmath46 for the norm on @xmath47 , and @xmath48 to represent weak convergence in both of these spaces .",
    "the tensor product of two vectors @xmath30 and @xmath37 is written @xmath49 ; it is the @xmath21 matrix whose @xmath50 entry is @xmath51 .",
    "the inner product of two matrices @xmath52 is @xmath53 .",
    "this obviously holds for vectors , too .",

    "we begin by establishing a regularity result for one - homogeneous stationary points of elliptic systems in two dimensions . a differencing method in the angular variable",
    "is used to show that @xmath1 solutions must in fact be @xmath58 .",
    "it then follows from the sobolev embedding theorem that all @xmath1 one - homogeneous stationary points must be lipschitz , which observation is useful later in the paper .",
    "although we have focused on the case of @xmath59 integrable weak derivatives , it is plausible that similar arguments could be used to improve the regularity of @xmath19 in @xmath60 with @xmath61 , provided the growth and ellipticity hypotheses are suitably modified .",
    "we do not do this since the improvement of regularity is ultimately put to a negative use in showing that such solutions are either affine or could not have existed in the first place .",

    "then @xmath149 is linear .",
    "[ remark1]_(h3 ) can hold for for functions @xmath100 whose spatial derivatives are singular at the origin , for example when @xmath155 for @xmath156 and appropriate functions @xmath102 and @xmath157 .",

    "now we set about improving the regularity of the angular function @xmath170 using the ellipticity hypothesis .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a clear exposition in the @xmath7independent case ; in our case a similar argument works because is a uniform condition .",
    "now @xmath100 is strongly rank - one monotone , that is if @xmath171 then @xmath172 by taking @xmath173 and @xmath174 for any fixed @xmath161 and @xmath80 in @xmath175 $ ] it follows that @xmath176 and hence that @xmath177 but @xmath178 as @xmath179 , and since for fixed @xmath86 the function @xmath180 is continuous in @xmath161 it must be that the left - hand side of converges to zero as @xmath181 .",

    "then implies that @xmath182 is a @xmath8 function of @xmath161 for each fixed @xmath86 .",
    "it is now possible to follow phillips s argument with only minor changes to deduce that @xmath183 exists .    from",

    "therefore @xmath18 is linear .",
    "in trying to prove the optimality of the results above it is natural to consider elliptic functionals which violate some of the conditions ( h1 ) - ( h3 ) . in this section",
    "we consider a specific functional which fails to be @xmath8 in its gradient variable , thereby violating two of the conditions of theorem [ t1 ] .",
    "the functional depends on the spatial variable as well as on the gradient of the competing functions .",
    "specifically , it is shown that there are non - trivial one - homogeneous solutions @xmath19 to a stationarity equation associated with the functional @xmath189 here , @xmath190 and @xmath191 is the annulus in @xmath26 centred on zero and with inner and outer radii @xmath192 and @xmath193 respectively .",
    "the reason for this particular choice of integrand will be made clear later on .",
    "the choice of an annular domain ( as opposed to a ball ) is forced on us . to see why , note that @xmath194 thus @xmath195 for all but the most trivial of problems where the integral over @xmath196 is zero .",
    "but by cutting @xmath63 out of the domain we can no longer argue that the one - homogeneous functions are singular at @xmath63 .",
    "something else has to be done to induce a singularity , which is the theme of the example discussed below .",
    "there are two strands to the argument of this section and the rest of the paper : one is concerned with existence , the other with ensuring that the solution , should it exist , is not linear .",
    "recall that phillips s theorem @xcite and theorem [ t1 ] above conclude either that solutions are affine or do not exist at all .",
    "we wish to avoid both possibilities .",
    "we turn first to the question of existence .",
    "the stationarity condition referred to above is the so - called equilibrium equation , meaning that @xmath197 in the @xmath7independent case , and under suitable hypotheses , it is implied by the euler - lagrange equation .",
    "see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "the integrand @xmath198 mentioned above will be polyconvex and singular , after the fashion of the well - known stored - energy functions introduced by ball in @xcite : for @xmath199 , let @xmath200 where @xmath201 if @xmath202 , and @xmath203 as @xmath204 .",
    "the function @xmath78 is positive , @xmath33 and strongly convex on @xmath205 .",
    "one immediate consequence of this choice for @xmath198 is that the functional @xmath206 is sequentially weakly lower semicontinuous with respect to weak convergence in @xmath207 .",
    "this is a special case of the well - known results of ball and murat @xcite ; we shall return to it in proposition [ ball - murat ] below .",
    "the second reason for choosing @xmath198 as above is to ensure that the minimizer @xmath18 of @xmath208 in some appropriate class @xmath209 , say , is not the angular part of a linear map .",
    "that is , we wish to prevent @xmath210 where @xmath211 is a constant @xmath54 matrix .",
    "( this condition is necessary and sufficient for the corresponding mapping @xmath212 to be linear . ) clearly , the success or otherwise of this approach will also depend on the class of functions @xmath209 over which @xmath208 is minimized . for now , suppose that any element @xmath18 of @xmath209 satisfies    * @xmath213 , and * @xmath18 has a continuous representative which visits the origin in @xmath26 at least once .    if we suppose that some element @xmath18 of @xmath209 ( not necessarily the minimizer ) satisfies then , by condition ( ii ) , @xmath214 . but then @xmath215 because @xmath216 is identically zero , contradicting ( i ) .",
    "thus _ no _ element @xmath18 of @xmath209 satisfying ( i ) and ( ii ) is such that @xmath19 is linear .",
    "this condition differs to other , topological methods in ensuring that solutions are not linear .",
    "for example , in the second half of their paper @xcite , bauman et al achieve the same goal essentially by restricting attention to a subclass of double - twist maps .",
    "these methods do not seem to apply to problems involving one - homogeneous mappings .",
    "the equilibrium equation arises in the context of singular integrands in @xcite and @xcite , and it is an appropriate starting point in the solution of problems in nonlinear elasticity theory . in particular , it has been used as a stepping stone on the way to proving that certain of its solutions also solve the euler - lagrange equation .",
    "the one - homogeneous solution @xmath19 we construct will turn out to be singular in the sense that it is has an unbounded gradient on a half - line in @xmath26 .",
    "it will be shown that this prevents @xmath19 from solving the euler - lagrange equation associated with @xmath217 .",
    "we investigate why this is so by giving a fairly detailed description of the manner in which the minimizer of @xmath208 in @xmath209 visits the origin in @xmath26 .",
    "in the following we shall assume @xmath218 , with the convention that @xmath219 , where @xmath161 represents the polar angle .",
    "let @xmath220 be a smooth function with compact support in @xmath196 , and let us refer to such @xmath80 as test functions .",

    "we remark that the test functions @xmath80 need not have compact support in @xmath196 in order that integration by parts functions properly . instead , the periodicity of these functions suffices .",
    "[ ball - murat ] let @xmath230 , where @xmath198 is as per , and let @xmath209 satisfy ( p0 ) and ( p1 ) above .",
    "then @xmath209 contains a global minimizer of @xmath208 .",
    "the direct method of the calculus of variations applies .",
    "any minimizing sequence @xmath231 is bounded uniformly in @xmath207 , which in view of the expression @xmath232 means that , for a subsequence , @xmath233 for some @xmath221 . by (",
