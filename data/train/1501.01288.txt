    "the data allow detection of photometric modulation induced by stellar spots that cross the stellar visible disk with the rotational period of the star . with the _ kepler _  data we can detect stellar rotational periods even for slowly rotating stars with low - amplitude modulation , for a well - defined large sample ( e.g. , * ? ?",

    "therefore , the distribution of the observed rotational amplitudes of a sample is not the real - amplitude distribution , as measured by an observer with a line of sight orthogonal to the stellar rotational axes . instead , subject to an observational detection threshold",

    "the angle between the stellar spin axis and the orbital planetary angular momentum for an individual planet , also referred to as the obliquity of the system , is a matter of intense study in recent years .",

    "@xcite has taken a statistical approach to identify kois with small stellar line broadening with respect to its expected distribution , if the stars were aligned with the planetary motion , given the stellar type and the experimental errors .",
    "he found 10 systems with probable high obliquity .",
    "finally , at about the submission of this paper , @xcite published an analysis of the observed rotational line broadening and rotational periods of 70 kois , obtaining posterior probability of the distribution of the stellar obliquities .",
    "they suggested with a 95% confidence level that the obliquities of stars with only a single detected transiting planet are systematically larger than those with detected multiple transiting planets .",
    "an interesting method was applied by @xcite and @xcite , who used brief photometric signals during transit induced by the transiting object moving across spots located on the surface of the host object .",

    "@xcite derived already the rotational periods of 737 kois . since then the list of kois and ebs were updated and more quarters became publicly available .",
    "we therefore performed the search for rotational photometric modulation again , using now the public release 14 quarter 314 ( q3q14 ) lcs , which were downloaded from the _ kepler _  mission archive .",
    "we omitted q0 and q1 due to their short duration and q2 because of significant residual systematics .",
    "we used the data corrected for instrumental systematics using pdc - map @xcite , which removes the majority of instrumental glitches and systematic trends using a bayesian approach , while retaining most real ( astrophysical ) variability .",
    "of the 3685 kois , 3662 had publicly available pdc - map q3-q14 lcs .",
    "the rotational period measurement was performed using the autoacf technique , described in detail in mma14 .",
    "this method is based on the measure of the degree of self - similarity of the lc over a range of lags . in the case of rotational modulation ,",
    "the repeated spot - crossing signatures lead to acf peaks at lags corresponding to the rotational period and integer multiples of it .",
    "the basic pre - processing steps applied to the pdc - map lcs are described in @xcite , including median normalization of each quarter and masking transit events .",
    "the automation of the detection method uses a training set of visually verified acf results to select only period detections with high probability of being true rotational measurements , based on the acf peak height , its period and the stellar temperature @xmath2 , and the consistency of the detection in different sections of the lc .",
    "a detailed description is given by mma14 .",
    "kois with inconsistent detections in different quarters were flagged by  m1 \" in the table , and the ones with peaks not high enough , depending on the temperature and period , by `` m2 '' .",
    "the autoacf yielded 1031 period detections .",
    "since there are a small number of kois compared to the full sample for which the automation routine was developed , we also visually examined all autoacf periodic koi detections , and removed 19 targets which either had false period detections , or the period did not appear to arise from rotational modulation .",
    "these have the  r \" flag set in table  [ tab : pers ] .",
    "the visually verified autoacf analysis yielded 1012 period detections .",
    "we found that for 18 of these targets , the centroid motions on the _ kepler _  ccd indicate that the transits and rotation are on different targets ( flag  c \" ) .",
    "a single star , kic8043882 , was removed from the sample because a valid amplitude of modulation measurement could not be made due to missing data sections .",
    "once these potential contaminants were removed , we were left with 993 period detections for main - sequence planet hosts , upon which this study focused . as in mma14 , to derive the photometric amplitude we divided the lc of each koi into time bins of the detected rotational period , obtained the photometric difference between the 5th and the 95th percentiles of normalized flux for all time bins , and then took the median of these values .",
    "the detected periods were between @xmath8 and @xmath9days , and the amplitude of the modulation , @xmath10 , ranges from @xmath11 to @xmath12mmag .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "to compare the kois with the _ kepler _  single - star sample we use the results of mma14 who reported rotational periods for 34,030 main - sequence stars observed by _ kepler_. the selection criteria for these targets were described in detail in mma14 , and included the same @xmath2 and @xmath4 cuts for main - sequence as are used in the present paper , as well as removal of known kois and ebs . for the present work we constrain the @xmath2 range to 35006500k , leaving a total sample of 33,614 single stars .    to compare the amplitudes of photometric modulation of the kois to those of the single stars of the _ kepler _  sample we plot in figure  [ fig : amptemp ] the amplitudes of the stars in the two samples as a function of the stellar temperature .",
    "in addition , each of the two samples are divided into 250k temperature bins , and the median of each bin is plotted .",
    "the scatter of each bin is estimated by its mad  the median of the absolute deviation of the amplitudes with respect to the median of each bin , multiplied by 1.48 .",
    "we prefer the mad estimate as it is less sensitive to the outliers .",
    "the error on the median of each bin , also plotted in the figure , is the @xmath13 of the sample in each bin , where @xmath14 is the number of points per bin .",
    "the figure also displays for each sample a running median , with 1000 and 250 points width for the single and the kois amplitudes , which were then smoothed with a width of 501 and 51 points , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : amptemp ] suggests that the kois have typically larger amplitudes than the single stars for all but the hottest two @xmath5 bins , 60006500k , which show significantly lower amplitudes for the kois . to check the significance of the differences we show in figure  [ fig : ampks ] the results of a two - sample kolmogorov",
    " smirnov ( k - s ) test for the kois and the single stars , performed for separate two temperature ranges35006000 and 60006500k .",
    "the _ p_-values for the null hypothesis , which assumes that the kois and the single stars are both drown from the same underlying amplitude distribution , are shown above the two panels of figure  [ fig : ampks ] .",
    "the _ p_-values of the two - sample k - s test , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , for the two temperature bins , respectively , suggest that the differences between the kois and the single stars are highly significant in both ranges of temperatures .",
    "the amplitude distributions of the kois and the single stars seem significantly different .",
    "however , before we can conclude that this is indirect evidence for a small star ",
    "planet obliquity of the cool stars and a high obliquity of the hot stars we have to consider possible selection effects that could have caused the amplitude differences .",
    "we consider in this section two possible such observational biases , one that has to do with the rotational periods of the kois and the single stars , and the other with stellar noise of the hot stars that determines the transit detection threshold .",
    "to consider the period issue , we constructed in each temperature bin a series of single - star subsamples with rotational period distributions similar to that of the kois , and showed that we obtain the same amplitude difference as with the real single - star sample . to study the problem of the stellar noise and the detection threshold , we generated a series of randomly simulated hot koi samples that could have been detected , and compare their amplitudes with those of the real koi and single - star samples .",
    "we find that the detection bias introduces a decrease in the koi s amplitudes , but the actual sample of kois displays a difference too large to be accounted for by the selection effect and is probably due to high obliquity .",
    "rotational periods and amplitudes are known to be correlated ( e.g. , @xcite ; mma14 ) , with typically higher amplitude variability at shorter periods .",
    "therefore , the amplitude difference we observe could be a result of a difference between the rotational periods of the kois and those of the single stars . to face this problem we performed a follow - up test of comparison , with matching period distributions for the koi and the single - star samples , to remove any possible bias introduced by different period distributions .",
    "we divided the sample into bins of 500k , selecting for each @xmath2-bin a _ random _ sample of single stars that approximately matched the period distributions of the kois of that temperature , and compared the median amplitudes of the kois and the single stars in each bin .",
    "this was done by dividing the period distributions into @xmath17 bins of width @xmath18 in log period between @xmath19 and @xmath20 , in days , with two additional bins for periods outside this range .",
    "we then selected a random sample of single stars , with twice the number of stars in each period bin as were in the kois sample for the same period bin .",
    "this was the maximum integer multiple possible in all @xmath2 and period bins .",
    "we then derived for each random choice of the single - star sample its median value .",
    "this process was then repeated 1000 times , with a new random sample of non - kois drawn each time , and the same full sample of kois used in each run . for each random sample we derived the difference between the median of the log amplitudes of the kois and the single stars , obtaining for each temperature bin a distribution of differences of medians , which were plotted in figure  [ fig : ampdiffhist ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : ampdiffhist ] is consistent with the picture revealed by the two previous ones . for the cool stars , the kois have , on the average , larger amplitudes than the single ones , on the order of @xmath11 in log amplitude , or a factor of @xmath21 larger .",
    "the hot kois , on the other hand , have smaller amplitudes , on the order of @xmath8 in log amplitude or a factor of @xmath22 smaller .",
    "we therefore conclude that the amplitude difference we observe is _ not _ a result of a period difference between the kois and the single stars .",
    "as pointed out by the anonymous referee , the small amplitudes of the hot stars could have been the result of observational selection effect . in his / her wise words ,  planets",
    "are more challenging to detect around stars with high variability , causing their stellar variability to appear systematically lower .",
    "this could be an issue for the hot stars which , on the main sequence , are larger than cool stars , making it more difficult to detect ... planets except around the least variable stars \" .    in order to estimate the magnitude of the contribution of the selection effect induced by the planet detection , following the referee s suggestion , we have generated 100,000 _ simulated _ samples of  planets around hot stars \" , for which their parent stars where randomly chosen under _",
    "discovery constraints .",
    "the goal is to find out how many of the simulated samples showed small amplitudes like the real sample , in order to estimate the significance of the amplitude difference between the kois and the hot single stars .    to form a simulated sample associated with the observed planets we have considered two real samples  the sample of planets orbiting hot stars with detected rotational periods ( 115 systems ; sample @xmath23 ) and the sample of all hot stars with known rotational periods and amplitudes , including the kois with known periods ( 4147 systems ; sample @xmath24 ) . for each planet \\{@xmath25 } we constructed a subsample , @xmath26 , chosen from the large sample @xmath24 , consisting of stars that could have been the parent star of @xmath27 and still be detected , given the stellar radius and photometric noise .",
    "a simulated sample of kois was then constructed by choosing randomly a star from each of the subsamples \\{@xmath28}.    for a star to be considered as a potential parent star to a planet @xmath27 and therefore included in the @xmath26 simulated sample , we required the potential star to have signal - to - noise ratio s / n@xmath29 , had it had the @xmath27 around it , in case the actual transit \\{s / n}@xmath30 , and s / n@xmath31 , if the actual transit \\{s / n}@xmath32 .",
    "to derive the potential s / n we used @xcite expression , which we write here as :",
    "@xmath33    where @xmath34 is the number of observed transits ,",
    "@xmath35 is the transit duration , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the stellar and planet radii and @xmath38 is the 3-hr photometric noise of _ kepler_. in fact , _ kepler _  site includes such a noise estimate for each observed quarter , so we used the median of these values , @xmath39 , for our simulations .",
    "the stellar radius was estimated from the stellar mass , @xmath40 , derived by @xcite , assuming main - sequence @xmath41 relation .",
    "we also assume that @xmath42 , and therefore conclude that for a given planet    @xmath43    we performed 100,000 simulations , each of which produced a simulated sample of hot stars with detected rotational periods and amplitudes , with enough s / n so the planets could have been detected . to compare the simulated sample with the real one we used two metrics  the median of the amplitudes and the _ p_-value of the two - sample k - s test when compared with the whole sample of hot stars .",
    "histograms of the 100,000 derived two measures are plotted in figures  [ fig : simulationampmedianhot ] and [ fig : simulationkshot ] .",
    "the histogram of figure  [ fig : simulationampmedianhot ] , centered around log - amplitude of @xmath44 ( in ppm units ) , as opposed to the median of the hot stars at @xmath45 , corroborates the suspicion of the referee  the detection threshold of planets results indeed in smaller amplitudes .",
    "the difference in log - amplitude indicates that this effect reduces the amplitudes by a factor of @xmath46 .",
    "however , the figure shows further that the median of the real sample of hot kois is smaller by another factor of 0.8 .",
    "this might suggest that the smallness of the amplitudes of the hot kois could be due _ also _ to some geometrical distribution .",
    "how significant is this finding ?",
    "the simulations presented in the two figures show that out of the 100000 simulations , only 594 showed a _",
    "p_-value of the k - s test smaller than the real one , and only 102 had a smaller median .",
    "the implication is that the chance of observing such a difference by a statistical fluke is 0.6% , according to the _ p_-value of the k - s test , or 0.1% , if we adopt the median metric .",
    "figure  [ fig : simulationkshot ] shows that the distribution of the k - s _",
    "p_-values has a long tail toward small values , if plotted on the log scale , and therefore might not be the best metric to distinguish between real and fluke result .",
    "we tend to adopt the 0.1% result , and contend that the smallness of the hot koi amplitudes , by a factor of 0.8 , is detected with a high statistical significance .",
    "the analysis presented here might have some implication on the geometrical distribution of the spin  orbit inclinations of the kois .",
    "suppose that the observed amplitude of the photometric spot modulation of a given star is proportional to @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the inclination of the axis of rotation of that star relative to our line of sight ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in such a case , we might expect naively that the average amplitude of a _",
    "sample _ of observed stars should be proportional to the expected value of @xmath47 of the sample@xmath49 @xcite .",
    "in real cases we have to consider the convolution of the distribution of the amplitudes with the distribution of inclinations , and take into account the detection threshold of the analysis , two factors that complicate the discussion . however , we assume these factors do not change the general picture we are trying to draw here .    now consider two samples , one with random orientations of its stellar rotational axes in space , with @xmath50 , and the other sample with all stars having @xmath51 , all other features being equal .",
    "we then expect the ratio of the two amplitude averages of the two samples to be of the order of @xmath52 .",
    "this is indeed close to what we get for the cool stars , when we compare the rotational amplitudes of the kois and those of the single stars of the _ kepler _  mission .",
    "we do find that the median of the amplitudes of the cool kois is larger by a factor of @xmath53 than the median of the single star amplitudes .",
    "if we assume that the spin axes of the single stars are randomly oriented , then our analysis suggests that the stellar spin of the kois have their rotational inclination close to @xmath0 .",
    "this is consistent with the assumption that the spin axes of the cool kois are aligned with the angular momentum of their transiting planets , which must have their _ orbital _ inclination close to @xmath0 .",
    "an opposite picture is revealed for the hot kois .",
    "the median amplitude of the hot kois is probably _ smaller _ by the same factor , @xmath54 , when compared to the median of the amplitudes of the single stars , taking into account the detection bias .",
    "this also might be accounted for by a geometrical effect . the maximum geometrical suppression of @xmath49 due to spin  orbit misalignment is achieved when all rotational axes are orthogonal to the orbital axes , which have their orbital inclinations close to @xmath0 .",
    "this leads to @xmath55 , while for random orientation @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , the reduction factor of @xmath49 is about @xmath56 .",
    "obviously , any other geometrical spin ",
    "orbit distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) should result in a less dramatic reduction .",
    "again , the convolution with the distribution of the amplitudes and the detection bias are going to blur the picture even more .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that the simplest approach yields a factor similar to the one inferred from the analysis is encouraging .",
    "we wish to call attention to two caveats of the analysis presented here :    * our analysis is not sensitive to the difference between prograde and retrograde rotational inclinations , as the amplitude depends on the absolute value of @xmath47 .",
    "namely , the cool kois , for which our analysis suggests rotational axes aligned with the planetary orbital motion , could have prograde or retrograde motion . different approaches , like the one suggested by @xcite , can shed some light , admittedly for only a very small number of cases , on this question .",
    "* we tried to look for differences between large and small planets , but could not convince ourselves , after the referee s doubts in particular , that the results are real , and not due to some observational biases .",
    "we suspect that the indirect approach of the present work is not capable of distinguishing between the large and small planets .",
    "after showing that the larger photometric amplitudes of the cool kois might be an indication for low obliquity of their planets , it is of interest to find out if this phenomenon is limited only to kois with short orbital periods , or it extends to the long periods .",
    "we therefore divided the cool kois into two period ranges , somewhat arbitrarily , of _ innermost _ orbital periods of 15 days and 550 days , as indicated in the orbital - period histogram , plotted in figure  [ fig : pplhistcool ] .",
    "planets with orbital periods outside the range 150 days might be too close or too far away from their parent stars to show the general trend we wish to study .            in figure",
    "[ fig : shortlongpplks_cool ] we plot the cumulative distributions of the photometric amplitudes of the cool kois with short ( 15 days ) and long ( 550 days ) orbital periods .",
    "distributions of all cool kois and _ kepler _  single stars are given for reference .",
    "the medians and the _ p_-value of the two - sample k - s test for the different samples are given too .",
    "the figure shows that the two subsamples have very similar amplitudes , with almost identical medians , distinctively different from the single cool stars .",
    "this suggests that the feature we have discovered  the larger photometric rotational amplitudes of the cool kois , is not only restricted to short orbital periods , but extend up to periods of 50 days . in our suggested interpretation , the low obliquity of planets around cool stars extends up to at least 50 days .",
    "in this study we compare the amplitude distribution of the rotation of 993 kois with the amplitudes of 33,614 single stars observed by the _ kepler _",
    "mission in temperature range of 35006500k , in order to shed some light on the statistical distribution of spin  orbit obliquity of the planetary systems .",
    "the analysis presented here is rather limited , because ( 1 ) the observed distribution of the amplitudes of any koi sample is the result of the convolution of the true obliquity with the real amplitude distribution of the sample , ( 2 ) we are sensitive only to the line of sight inclination and not to the true obliquity , and ( 3 ) our measurements are subject to observational biases .",
    "the latter is stronger for smaller planets and hot stars .",
    "although we can try and debias the observations , this inserts a high degree of uncertainty into our results . on the other hand",
    ", the analysis presented here does not require any additional observational resources , and can be applied to a large sample of kois , with short and long orbital periods alike .",
    "the comparison between the amplitude distributions shows that in the temperature range of 35006000k the amplitudes of the kois are larger , on the order of 10% , than those of the single stars , consistent with the assumption that the spin ",
    "orbit obliquity is rather small for cool stars .",
    "the low obliquity extends up to at least 50 days .",
    "for the hot stars , with a temperature range of 60006500k , we have found the opposite effect .",
    "the amplitudes of the hot kois are probably _ smaller _ by the same factor , of the order of 10% , when compared to the amplitudes of the single stars , taking into account the detection bias",
    ". this could be the result of the high obliquity of the hot stars .",
    "our findings are consistent with @xcite and @xcite , who discovered such a transition between aligned and non - aligned systems at about 6250k",
    ".    the analysis presented here might shed some light on the mechanism responsible for the spin ",
    "orbit dichotomy between planets around cool and hot stars . in their seminal paper , @xcite discussed two possible scenarios to account for their findings .",
    "the first had to do with formation mechanism  planets around hot stars might have originally formed with high obliquities , while planets around low - mass stars have been formed with low obliquities ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . @xcite then focused on a different scenario , where the spin  orbit dichotomy arises from a later evolution of the system . in their scenario planets",
    "go through a high obliquity phase , probably due to planet  planet scattering , which is then followed by a long tidal interaction period .",
    "the tidal interaction affects hot and cool stars differentially .",
    "@xcite suggested that since cool stars have convective envelopes , their tidal interaction with the planets is more effective , leading to the alignment of the planetary orbit with the rotation of its host cool star .",
    "conversely , hot stars , whose envelopes are radiative , can not align the planetary orbits .    within the tidal realignment models ,",
    "the alignment timescale depends on the planet s separation from its host star .",
    "such models therefore predict that only short - period planets should be aligned with their host star s rotation , as the tidal realignment becomes negligible for long - period planets .",
    "our results are probably not aligned with this prediction , because we find evidence that the small obliquity of the cool kois extends to at least 50 days , while the tidal planet  star interaction is probably not very effective in long , 1050 days , orbital periods .",
    "_ kepler _  provided us with the rare capability of studying a sample of about 150,000 almost uninterrupted lcs , out of which we discovered thousands of new planets and tens of thousands stellar rotations .",
    "the combination of the two can be used as a new tool to explore the characteristic statistical features of planet  star interaction , of which",
    "this study is an example . to better exploit this exciting opportunity , investigating the planet ",
    "star obliquity in particular , we should combine different techniques , like r - m effect , the line - broadening approach , asteroseismology , and spot crossing analysis , applied to specific systems , together with statistical approaches like the one presented here .",
    "this could reveal more features of the obliquity and its dependence on stellar temperature and planetary mass and orbital period , and shed some light on the formation and evolution of planetary systems .",
