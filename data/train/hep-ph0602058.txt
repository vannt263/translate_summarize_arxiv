    "in the past few years a new standard model of cosmology has been established in which most of the energy density of the universe is made up of cold dark matter and a component with negative pressure , generically referred to as dark energy .",
    "this model provides an amazingly good fit to all observational data with relatively few free parameters and has allowed for stringent constraints on the basic cosmological parameters .",
    "the precision of the data is now at a level where observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , the large scale structure ( lss ) of galaxies , and type ia supernovae can be used to probe important aspects of particle physics such as neutrino properties .",
    "conversely , cosmology is now also at a level where unknowns from the particle physics side can significantly bias estimates of cosmological parameters .",
    "the prime example of this interplay between particle physics and cosmology is the use of cosmological data to probe neutrino physics .",
    "particularly the possibility to constrain the neutrino mass using cosmological measurements has been studied extensively .",
    "if only the three known neutrino flavour states , @xmath0 , are considered , they must correspond to three mass eigenstates , @xmath1 .",
    "the two sets are related by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the @xmath4 neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "the neutrino oscillation probability in the general @xmath4 oscillation case is quite complicated , but always depends on @xmath5 , i.e.  on squared mass differences .",
    "the combination of all currently available data from neutrino oscillation experiments suggests two important mass differences in the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "the solar mass difference of @xmath6 ev@xmath7 @xmath8 and the atmospheric mass difference @xmath9 ev@xmath7 @xmath8 @xcite . in the simplest case where neutrino masses are hierarchical",
    "these results suggest that @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 . if the hierarchy is inverted one instead finds @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 . however , it is also possible that neutrino masses are degenerate , @xmath16 .",
    "since oscillation probabilities depend only on squared mass differences , @xmath17 , such experiments have no sensitivity to the absolute value of neutrino masses , and if the masses are degenerate oscillation experiments are not useful for determining the absolute mass scale .",
    "experiments which rely on kinematical effects of the neutrino mass offer the most robust probe of this overall mass scale .",
    "tritium decay measurements by the mainz experiment have been able to put an upper limit on the effective electron neutrino mass of @xmath18 ev ( 95% conf . ) @xcite ( note that this is an incoherent sum so that cancellation due to phases can not occur ) .",
    "however , cosmology at present provides an even better limit , as will be discussed in detail in the next sections .",
    "very interestingly there is also a claim of direct detection of neutrinoless double beta decay in the heidelberg - moscow experiment @xcite .",
    "neutrinoless double beta decay is only possible if neutrinos are majorana particles because it requires violation of lepton number .",
    "the lifetime of the neutrinoless mode of the decay is inversely proportional to the square of the effective mass of the neutrino because it involves flipping the spin of the internal neutrino .",
    "the claimed lifetime of @xmath19 measured by the experiment can be translated to a neutrino mass .",
    "however , there is a large uncertainty in this translation because the involved nuclear matrix element is quite difficult to calculate ( see for instance @xcite ) . including the estimated matrix element uncertainty the result corresponds to an effective neutrino mass in the @xmath20 ev range for the parameter @xmath21 ( note that",
    ", contrary to the tritium measurement , this is a coherent sum which means that it can be suppressed by phases in the mixing matrix ) .",
    "if this result is confirmed then it shows that neutrino masses are almost degenerate .",
    "another important question which can be answered by cosmological observations is how large the total neutrino energy density is .",
    "apart from the standard model prediction of three light neutrinos , such energy density can be either in the form of additional , sterile neutrino degrees of freedom , or a non - zero neutrino chemical potential .    in this review",
    "i discuss mainly these two questions . due to the limited space available other interesting aspects of neutrino cosmology , such as leptogenesis ,",
    "have been left out .",
    "the interested reader is referred to the very thorough review @xcite .",
    "the paper is divided into sections in the following way : in section 2 i review the thermal evolution of light neutrinos , particularly aspects related to the decoupling of neutrinos around a temperature of 1 mev .",
    "i also discuss big bang nucleosynthesis and its relation to neutrino physics .",
    "i section 3 i discuss the current cosmological data available , and section 4 contains a review of bounds on neutrino properties from this data .",
    "finally , section 5 contains a discussion .",
    "in the standard model neutrinos interact via weak interactions with charged leptons , keeping them in equilibrium with the electromagnetic plasma at high temperatures . below @xmath22 mev @xmath23 and @xmath24",
    "are the only relevant particles , greatly reducing the number of possible reactions which must be considered . in the absence of oscillations neutrino",
    "decoupling can be followed via the boltzmann equation for the single particle distribution function @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 represents all elastic and inelastic interactions . in the standard model",
    "all these interactions are @xmath27 interactions in which case the collision integral for process @xmath28 can be written @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the spin - summed and averaged matrix element including the symmetry factor @xmath31 if there are identical particles in initial or final states .",
    "the phase - space factor is @xmath32 .",
    "the matrix elements for all relevant processes can for instance be found in ref .",
    "if maxwell - boltzmann statistics is used for all particles , and neutrinos are assumed to be in complete scattering equilbrium so that they can be represented by a single temperature , then the collision integral can be integrated to yield the average annihilation rate for a neutrino @xmath33 where @xmath34    this rate can then be compared with the hubble expansion rate @xmath35    to find the decoupling temperature from the criterion @xmath36 . from this one",
    "finds that @xmath37 mev , @xmath38 mev , when @xmath39 , as is the case in the standard model .",
    "this means that neutrinos decouple at a temperature which is significantly higher than the electron mass .",
    "when @xmath40 annihilation occurs around @xmath41 , the neutrino temperature is unaffected whereas the photon temperature is heated by a factor @xmath42 .",
    "the relation @xmath43 holds to a precision of roughly one percent .",
    "the main correction comes from a slight heating of neutrinos by @xmath40 annihilation , as well as finite temperature qed effects on the photon propagator @xcite .      shortly after neutrino decoupling",
    "the weak interactions which keep neutrons and protons in statistical equilibrium freeze out . again",
    "the criterion @xmath44 can be applied to find that @xmath45 mev @xcite .",
    "eventually , at a temperature of roughly 0.2 mev deuterium starts to form , and very quickly all free neutrons are processed into @xmath46he .",
    "the final helium abundance is therefore roughly given by @xmath47    @xmath48 is determined by its value at freeze out , roughly by the condition that @xmath49 .",
    "since the freeze - out temperature is determined by @xmath50 this in turn means that @xmath50 can be inferred from a measurement of the helium abundance .",
    "however , since @xmath51 is a function of both @xmath52 and @xmath50 it is necessary to use other measurements to constrain @xmath52 in order to find a bound on @xmath50 .",
    "one customary method for doing this has been to use measurements of primordial deuterium to infer @xmath52 and from that calculate a bound on @xmath50 . usually such bounds are expressed in terms of the equivalent number of neutrino species , @xmath53 , instead of @xmath50 .",
    "the exact value of the bound is quite uncertain because there are different and mutually inconsistent measurements of the primordial helium abundance ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of this issue ) .",
    "some of the most recent analyses are @xcite where a value of @xmath54 ( 95% c.l . )",
    "was found , @xcite which found @xmath55 , and @xcite which found that @xmath56 at 68% c.l .",
    "the difference in these results can be attributed to different assumptions about uncertainties in the primordial helium abundance .",
    "it should be noted that all these results are consistent with @xmath57 , the standard model result .",
    "if a low helium abundance is assumed than the bbn bound severely restricts additional relativistic energy density beyond the standard model prediction .",
    "a full extra neutrino degree of freedom is excluded at high significance . however",
    ", that is not the case when a higher helium abundance is assumed , and the fact that the bound is dependent on assumptions should indicate that it is not a level of precision where it can be completely trusted .    another interesting parameter which can be constrained by the same argument is the neutrino chemical potential , @xmath58 @xcite . at first sight",
    "this looks like it is completely equivalent to constraining @xmath59 .",
    "however , this is not true because a chemical potential for electron neutrinos directly influences the @xmath60 conversion rate .",
    "furthermore , it is crucial to take neutrino flavour oscillations into account when calculating bounds on the neutrino chemical potential . this point is discussed in more detail below .",
    "standard model neutrinos interact via exchange of @xmath61 and @xmath62 bosons where the coupling strength at low energy @xmath63 is given by fermi s constant @xmath64 the @xmath65 comes from the vector boson propagator .",
    "however , at energies beyond @xmath66 the propagator will have @xmath66 replaced by momentum exchange @xmath67 .",
    "since this should be roughly equal to the thermal energy of an average particle in the medium , the effective interaction rate should go from @xmath68 to @xmath69 comparing this with the hubble parameter which in the radiation dominated regime is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : hub ] ) , one finds that @xmath70 at high temperatures @xmath71 will be less than 1 and neutrinos will be out of equilibrium .",
    "the temperatures where this happens is roughly @xmath72 which is far beyond the range where the standard model applies .",
    "however , even if the above example is therefore not physically relevant it shows that neutrinos which interact via exchange of massless particles will always have an interaction rate ( for @xmath27 processes ) which is @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a dimensionless quantity .",
    "therefore such interactions will always drive neutrinos _ toward _ thermal equilibrium at late times instead of out of equilibrium .",
    "one example which has received significant attention recently is the possibility that neutrinos couple to a massless scalar or pseudoscalar particle .",
    "if the interaction is sufficiently strong the neutrinos will come into equilibrium after bbn but before the present and consequently they will annihilate and disappear when @xmath75 @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nueq ] we show @xmath71 for massless standard model neutrinos .",
    "as can be seen , neutrinos decouple from thermal equilibrium when @xmath76 mev .",
    "however for @xmath77 the cross section drops and neutrinos are out of equilibrium at very early times . in the same figure",
    "we also show what happens if neutrinos couple to a light scalar , in which case they come into equilibrium at late times .      in the previous section the one - particle distribution function , @xmath78 ,",
    "was used to describe neutrino evolution . however , for neutrinos the mass eigenstates are not equivalent to the flavour eigenstates because neutrinos are mixed .",
    "therefore the evolution of the neutrino ensemble is not in general described by the three scalar functions , @xmath79 , but rather by the evolution of the neutrino density matrix , @xmath80 , the diagonal elements of which correspond to @xmath79 .    for three - neutrino oscillations",
    "the formalism is quite complicated .",
    "however , the difference in @xmath81 and @xmath82 , as well as the fact that @xmath83 means that the problem effectively reduces to a @xmath84 oscillation problem in the standard model .",
    "the effect of oscillations on the decoupling of neutrinos was discussed in @xcite .",
    "a detailed account of the physics of neutrino oscillations in the early universe is outside the scope of the present review , however an excellent and very thorough discussion of this topic can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    without oscillations it is possible to compensate a very large chemical potential for muon and/or tau neutrinos with a small , negative electron neutrino chemical potential @xcite .",
    "however , since neutrinos are almost maximally mixed a chemical potential in one flavour can be shared with other flavours , and the end result is that during bbn all three flavours have almost equal chemical potential @xcite .",
    "this in turn means that the bound on @xmath85 applies to all species .",
    "the most recent bound on the neutrino asymmetry from bbn comes from @xcite    @xmath86    for @xmath87 .",
    "the bound assumes complete flavour equilibration during bbn , which with the measured mixing angles and mass differences is a fairly good approximation . in models",
    "where sterile neutrinos are present even more remarkable oscillation phenomena can occur . however , i do not discuss this possibility further , except for the possibility of sterile neutrino warm dark matter , and instead refer to the review @xcite .      in most models of inflation",
    "the universe enters the normal , radiation dominated epoch at a reheating temperature , @xmath88 , which is of order the electroweak scale or higher . however , in principle it is possible that this reheating temperature is much lower , of order mev . this possibility has been studied many times in the literature , and a very general bound of @xmath89 mev has been found @xcite    this very conservative bound comes from the fact that the light element abundances produced by big bang nucleosynthesis disagree with observations if the universe if matter dominated during bbn .",
    "however , a somewhat more stringent bound can be obtained by looking at neutrino thermalization during reheating .",
    "if a scalar particle is responsible for reheating then direct decay to neutrinos is suppressed because of the necessary helicity flip .",
    "this means that if the reheating temperature is too low neutrinos never thermalize .",
    "if this is the case then bbn predicts the wrong light element abundances .",
    "however , even if the heavy particle has a significant branching ratio into neutrinos there are problems with bbn .",
    "the reason is that neutrinos produced in decays are born with energies which are much higher than thermal .",
    "if the reheating temperature is too low then a population of high energy neutrinos will remain and also lead to conflict with observed light element abundances .",
    "recent analyses have shown that in general the reheating temperature can not be below a few mev @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "even though bbn considerations do provide interesting bounds on neutrino physics attention has shifted towards observations of the late - time universe . in recent years observations of physics after recombination has provided very strong constraint on many cosmological parameters and also on neutrino physics . in this section",

    "the neutrino perturbations are washed out completely , leaving only perturbations in the non - relativistic matter ( cdm and baryons ) .",
    "therefore the _ relative _ suppression of power is proportional to the ratio of neutrino energy density to the overall matter density .",
    "clearly the above relation only applies when @xmath176 , when @xmath177 becomes dominant the spectrum suppression becomes exponential as in the pure hot dark matter model .",
    "this effect is shown for different neutrino masses in fig .",
    "[ fig : nutrans ] .",
    "the effect of massive neutrinos on structure formation only applies to the scales below the free - streaming length .",
    "for neutrinos with masses of several ev the free - streaming scale is smaller than the scales which can be probed using present cmb data and therefore the power spectrum suppression can be seen only in large scale structure data . on the other hand , neutrinos of sub - ev mass behave almost like a relativistic neutrino species for cmb considerations .",
    "the main effect of a small neutrino mass on the cmb is that it leads to an enhanced early isw effect .",
    "the reason is that the ratio of radiation to matter at recombination becomes larger because a sub - ev neutrino is still relativistic or semi - relativistic at recombination .        because massive neutrinos affect structure formation it is possible to constrain their mass using a combination of cosmological data .",
    "the standard approach to cosmological parameter estimation is to use bayesian statistics which provides a very simple method for incorporating prior information on parameters from other sources . using the prior probability distribution",
    "it is then possible to calculate the posterior distribution and from that to derive confidence limits on parameters .",
    "there are standard packages such as cosmomc @xcite , a likelihood calculator based on the markov chain monte carlo method @xcite , available for this purpose .",
    "it should be noted here that confidence limits derived using bayesian statistics in this way are often much more stringent than implied by frequentist statistics , in which one calculates the confidence with which a given hypothesis can be excluded .",
    "the main reason for this is that observables in our universe is a single realization of an underlying distribution .",
    "there is no possibility for producing new data to test the hypothesis and therefore the frequentist approach in many cases does not fully use the information provided by the given data .",
    "much more detailed discussions of this point can be found in @xcite . in the remainder of this section",
    "we discuss only results derived using the bayesian method .",
    "independent of the statistical method used results will in general depend on the number of parameters used to fit the data . because of parameter",
    "degeneracies bounds on a given parameter will in general get weaker if more parameters are used in the fit .",
    "however , the question remains as to how many parameters should plausibly be included .",
    "if nothing is known a priori about the cosmological model the best - fit @xmath178 for @xmath179 parameters should in general be substantially lower for @xmath180 parameters if the additional parameter is to be included .",
    "this point has been extensively discussed in @xcite , and if used at face value indicates that the vanilla @xmath161cdm model with @xmath167 is the preferred model .",
    "this model assumes spatial flatness and uses only the following free parameters : @xmath115 , the matter density , @xmath181 , the baryon density , @xmath182 , the hubble parameters , @xmath133 , the optical depth to reionization , and @xmath183 , the amplitude of primordial density fluctuations .",
    "it furthermore assumes that the primordial perturbations are purely adiabatic in nature .",
    "however , even though the best fit @xmath178 for neutrino mass is for @xmath184 that certainly does not mean the neutrino masses should not be included in parameter fitting .",
    "the neutrino mass is known from oscillation experiments to be non - zero and therefore must be included in parameter estimation .",
    "furthermore almost all studies of constraints on non - standard cosmological parameters assume the minimal @xmath161cdm model as the benchmark and then include the non - standard parameters specific to the given study .",
    "this approach is dangerous because there could easily be several non - standard parameters which produce a much better fit when combined .",
    "it is important to study more general models , especially since numerical techniques have now made it feasible to use many more free parameters .",
    "below we will discuss one case where including two non - standard parameters can lead to completely changed conclusions about neutrino mass bounds .",
    "with the wmap data alone sensitivity to the neutrino mass is relatively limited . in a standard likelihood analysis for the 6 parameters of the minimal @xmath161cdm model plus neutrino mass",
    "we find an upper bound of @xmath185 ev ( 95% c.l . ) .",
    "this value is consistent with that derived in other recent analyses @xcite .    including lss data the bound can be improved .",
    "however , if there is no information on the normalization of the large scale structure power spectrum ( the bias parameter ) , the improvement is relatively modest . for the same model as above the bound for wmap+sdss",
    "is 1.8 ev @xcite .",
    "once other data , such as type ia supernova measurements , are included the bound can be improved significantly .",
    "a very stringent constraint comes from including information on the normalization of the matter power spectrum from measurements of the lyman-@xmath117 forest . in @xcite",
    "a bound of @xmath186 ev ( 95% c.l . ) was derived using wmap , sdss , sni - a , and lyman-@xmath117 data for the standard @xmath161cdm model with neutrino mass ( @xcite found an almost identical result ) .",
    "however , the uncertainty related to the modelling of the intergalactic medium at high redshift does make the bound model dependent .",
    "another very interesting bound can be derived when the measurement of the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) peak @xcite is included @xcite .",
    "even for a very general model with 11 free parameters ( adding the number of neutrino species @xmath59 , a possible running of the spectral index , @xmath187 , and the dark energy equation of state , @xmath113 ) the upper bound was found to be 0.48 ev ( 95% c.l . ) @xcite .",
    "this is quite interesting because without the bao data it was shown in @xcite that there is a severe degeneracy between @xmath188 and @xmath113 . for cmb , lss and sni - a data",
    "the bound on @xmath188 can be relaxed by as much as a factor of 3 when @xmath113 is allowed to vary .",
    "this degeneracy is broken by adding the bao data because it provides a tight relation between @xmath115 and @xmath113 .",
    "the result is also encouraging because the systematic uncertainty in the bao measurement is likely to be much smaller than in the lyman-@xmath117 forest data .",
    "furthermore the derived best fit model is almost exactly identical to the best fit model found in @xcite , indicating that the lyman-@xmath117 and bao data are completely consistent .",
    "finally , if both bao and lyman-@xmath117 data is combined the bound strengthens to @xmath189 ev ( 95% c.l . ) @xcite , but with the same caveat with regards to the lyman-@xmath117 data as before .    in conclusion",
    "the current bound on the sum of neutrino masses can be in the range between 0.3 and 2 ev , depending on the data and parameters used .",
    "in general : + a ) the bound on @xmath188 for the minimal @xmath161cdm plus neutrino mass ( 8 parameters in total ) is in the 0.5 - 0.6 ev range if cmb , lss , and sni - a data is used .",
    "+ b ) this bound can be relaxed by a large factor when more parameters , such as @xmath113 and @xmath59 are included , showing that the bound is not robust .",
    "+ c ) even including several new parameters the bound can be pushed below 0.5 ev when additional data is added to the basic cmb , lss , and sni - a data .",
    "either baryon acoustic oscillation or lyman-@xmath117 forest data can be used , with almost identical result .",
    "especially the bao data seem to be almost free of systematics , and consequently the bound seems to be robustly in the 0.5 ev range .",
    "+ for those interested an ( incomplete ) list of other studies of neutrino mass bounds from cosmological data can be found in @xcite .    in table",
    "[ table : fits ] various upper bounds on neutrino mass are summarized .",
    "the cases 1 - 4 are taken from @xcite and show quite clearly that results are strongly dependent on data and parameters used . also shown in this table is a selection of other recent results , all based on the standard @xmath161cdm plus neutrino parameter set .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : numass ] we show the upper bound on the sum of neutrino masses for various cases which are presented in table [ table : fits ] . also shown in this figure",
    "is the sum of neutrino masses as a function of the mass of the lightest mass eigenstate .",
    "the red band is for the normal hierarchy and the blue is for the inverted hierarchy .",
    "all bounds were calculated assuming that the neutrino mass is shared equally between all species . as can be seen from the figure that assumption is clearly justified at present . in the same figure",
    "we also show the best fit region for the claimed detection of neutrinoless double beta decay by the heidelberg - moscow experiment @xcite . there does seem to be some tension between the derived upper bound from cosmology and this result .",
    "however , at present it seems premature to exclude it based on cosmological arguments .",
    "this is particularly true because the exact value of the mass inferred from the experiment is highly uncertain because of the uncertainty in the nuclear matrix element calculation .    in this section",
    "we have discussed only active neutrino species .",
    "however , the framework applies equally well to sterile neutrinos and other light species .",
    "for instance @xcite have derived stringent limits on light sterile neutrinos ( see also @xcite ) .    lc case & @xmath190 ( 95% c.l . ) 1 : 11 parameters , cmb , lss , sni - a & 2.3 ev 2 : 11 parameters , cmb , lss , sni - a , bao & 0.48 ev 3 : 8 parameters , cmb , lss , sni - a , bao & 0.44 ev 4 : 8 parameters , cmb , lss , sni - a , bao , ly-@xmath117 & 0.30 ev other recent bounds & 8 parameters , wmap only @xcite & 2 ev 8 parameters , wmap , sdss @xcite & 1.8 ev 8 parameters , wmap , sdss , sni - a , ly-@xmath117 @xcite & 0.42 ev      the mass bounds derived from cosmology depend on the assumption that neutrinos have no interactions beyond the standard model weak interactions . however , experimental constraints on non - standard neutrino interactions are in general quite weak and allows for the possibility of new , cosmologically important interactions .",
    "one example is neutrinos coupling to a light scalar or pseudoscalar , as was discussed in section [ sec : rec ] . in this case",
    "neutrinos come into thermal equilibrium with the scalar late in the evolution of the universe .",
    "this was studied in @xcite as a possible way of circumventing the cosmological bound on neutrino masses .",
    "the idea is that neutrinos coupling to a new massless degree of freedom will annihilate and disappear once @xmath75 , leaving only little imprint on large scale structure .",
    "however , neutrinos which are strongly coupled will undergo acoustic oscillations prior to cmb formation instead of damping via free streaming ( anisotropic stress ) . since neutrino perturbations act as a source term for the baryon - photon oscillations this will increase the amplitude of cmb anisotropies on scales small than the horizon scale at recombination .",
    "this effect was studied numerically in @xcite .",
    "both studies find that this effect disfavours strongly coupled neutrinos , although the exact level of significance differs .",
    "the same effect was also studied analytically in @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that @xcite studied the effect only in the strong coupling limit . in the intermediate regime",
    "the situation is more complicated ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that strongly interacting neutrinos are disfavoured by cmb and lss data means that any model producing neutrino interactions strong enough to fast momentum exchange around the epoch of recombination @xcite . in the case of interactions with a light pseudoscalar like the majoron this leads to a very rough bound on the diagonal coupling @xmath191 of @xmath192 from consideration of pair creation and annihilation processes . for the off - diagonal coupling",
    "it is roughly @xmath193 which is in fact the strongest known bound on these parameters .",
    "an exact calculation of the bound would require a solution of the boltzmann equation for neutrinos in the intermediate coupling regime around recombination .",
    "another possibility which has received quite a lot of attention recently is the possibility of neutrinos coupling to a very light scalar field @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the coupling can produce an effective neutrino mass which is density dependent ( mass varying neutrinos ) , and by tuning the coupling it is possible to have the combined neutrino - scalar fluid have an effective equation of state close to @xmath194 , i.e.  dark energy .",
    "it was subsequently argued that the particular form of the potential in @xcite leads to a small scale instability which drives @xmath113 to 0 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , this instability apparently requires two conditions to be fulfilled : a ) the effective mass of the light scalar should have @xmath195 and b ) the equation of state should obey @xmath196 .",
    "both these conditions can be violated by other potentials ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "mass varying neutrinos have been discussed in other contexts , for instance in @xcite .",
    "the bbn bound on the number of neutrino species presented in the previous section can be complemented by a similar bound from observations of the cmb and large scale structure .",
    "the cmb depends on @xmath59 mainly because of the early integrated sachs wolfe effect which increases fluctuation power at scales slightly larger than the first acoustic peak .",
    "the large scale structure spectrum depends on @xmath59 because the scale of matter - radiation equality is changed by varying @xmath59 .",
    "many recent papers have used cmb , lss , and sni - a data to calculate bounds bounds on @xmath59 @xcite , and some of the bounds are listed in table [ table : nnu ] .",
    "recent analyses combining bbn , cmb , and large scale structure data can be found in @xcite , and these results are also listed in table [ table : nnu ] .",
    "common for all the bounds is that @xmath197 is ruled out by both bbn and cmb / lss .",
    "this has the important consequence that the cosmological neutrino background has been positively detected , not only during the bbn epoch , but also much later , during structure formation .",
    "the most recent bound which uses the sni - a `` gold '' data set , as well as the new boomerang cmb data finds a limit of @xmath198 at 95% c.l .",
    "the bound from late - time observations is now as good as that from bbn , and the two derived value are mutually consistent given the systematic uncertainties in the primordial helium abundance .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : nnu ] we show the currently allowed region for @xmath52 and @xmath59 ( taken from @xcite ) , showing the overlap between bbn constraints and the cmb+lss+sni - a constraint .    in principle , even if the neutrino mass is very small , it could be possible to detect the difference between additional relativistic energy density , parameterized by @xmath59 , and a non - thermal distribution of the active neutrinos @xcite .",
    "however , it is unlikely that the precision of observational data from planned experiments will be sufficient to measure the difference .",
    ".various recent limits on the effective number of neutrino species , as well as the data used .

    "this means that if the sum of neutrino masses is anywhere close to saturating the bound then neutrino masses must the almost degenerate .",
    "the question is whether in the future it will be possible to measure masses which are of the order @xmath82 , i.e.  whether it can determined if neutrino masses are hierarchical .    by combining future cmb data from the planck satellite with a galaxy survey like the sdss",
    "it has been estimated that neutrino masses as low as about 0.1 ev can be detected @xcite when analyzed within the minimal 8 parameter @xmath161cdm model .",
    "however , the degeneracy between @xmath188 and @xmath113 found in present data is likely to persist even with much more accurate future data @xcite , limiting the precision with which the neutrino mass can be measured .",
    "one very powerful probe which will become available in the future is weak gravitational lensing . with future cmb experiments like planck @xcite and the proposed inflation probe",
    "@xcite it will be possible to measure lensing effects on the cmb itself . in this case",
    "it seems likely that a sensitivity below 0.1 ev can also be reached with cmb alone @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to probe weak lensing at much lower redshifts",
    ". this can be done by measuring lensing of background galaxies by large scale structure .",
    "this has the major advantage that it is possible to perform lensing tomography by binning data in different redshift bins . in @xcite",
    "the projected sensitivity from combining future cmb data with a large scale weak lensing survey was studied .",
    "it was estimated that at @xmath200 the sensitivity could be pushed to 0.03 ev .",
    "such lensing surveys are planned with experiments such as the large synaptic survey telescope ( lsst ) which is planned to start in 2012 @xcite . at present the systematic uncertainties related to such surveys",
    "is to some extent unknown .",
    "one source of error is related to the uncertainty in measurements of galaxy shapes and another is related to the fact the redshift of galaxies must be estimated photometrically since spectroscopy is not feasible for the large number of galaxies needed .",
    "estimates in general show that it will be possible to control the errors at the required level @xcite .",
    "another promising tool which could further increase sensitivity is to use future cluster surveys @xcite .",
    "such a survey could also bring the sensitivity to 0.03 ev .    as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite the exact value of the sensitivity at this level depends both on whether the hierarchy is normal or inverted , and the exact value of the mass splittings . at this level",
    ", neutrino masses can not be regarded as degenerate and the normal and inverted hierarchy models must be tested separately .",
    "while cdm is defined as consisting of non - interacting particles which have essentially no free - streaming on any astronomically relevant scale , and hdm is defined by consisting of particles which become non - relativistic around matter radiation equality or later , warm dark matter is an intermediate .",
    "one of the simplest production mechanisms for warm dark matter is active - sterile neutrino oscillations in the early universe @xcite .",
    "one possible benefit of warm dark matter is that it does have some free - streaming so that structure formation is suppressed on very small scales .",
    "this has been proposed as an explanation for the apparent discrepancy between observations of galaxies and numerical cdm structure formation simulations . in general simulations",
    "produce galaxy halos which have very steep inner density profiles @xmath201 , where @xmath202 , and numerous subhalos @xcite .",
    "neither of these characteristics are seen in observations and the explanation for this discrepancy remains an open question . if dark matter is warm instead of cold , with a free - streaming scale comparable to the size of a typical galaxy subhalo then the amount of substructure is suppressed , and possibly the central density profile is also flattened @xcite . in both cases the mass of the dark matter particle should be around 0.5  1 kev @xcite , assuming that it is thermally produced in the early universe .    on the other hand , from measurements of the lyman-@xmath117 forest flux power spectrum it has been possible to reconstruct the matter power spectrum on relatively small scales at high redshift .",
    "this spectrum does not show any evidence for suppression at sub - galaxy scales and has been used to put a lower bound on the mass of warm dark matter particles of roughly 500 ev @xcite .",
    "an even more severe problem lies in the fact that star formation occurs relatively late in warm dark matter models because small scale structure is suppressed",
    ". this may be in conflict with the low-@xmath102 cmb temperature - polarization cross correlation measurement by wmap which indicates very early reionization and therefore also early star formation .",
    "one recent investigation of this found warm dark matter to be inconsistent with wmap for masses as high as 10 kev @xcite .    very interestingly",
    "a kev sterile neutrino will decay radiatively and produce x - ray photons which can reionize the universe at high redshift .",
    "the decay lifetime is given purely in terms of the mass and mixing angle with active species @xmath203 since the total contribution to the energy density is also given purely in terms of these parameters ( assuming a zero lepton assymetry ) it is possible to calculate the total x - ray photon intensity as a function of redshift .",
    "such decays have been proposed as a possible explanation for the very high optical depth indicated by the wmap polarization measurement which seems to require partial reionization already at @xmath204 @xcite . however , in this case the mass must be several kev in order to have a short enough lifetime ( since @xmath205 ) .",
    "therefore there does not seem to be a common mass which can address both the structure formation problems and the reionization problems .",
    "the case for warm dark matter seems quite marginal , although at present it is not definitively ruled out by any observations .",
    "in the present paper i have discussed how cosmological observations can be used for probing fundamental properties of neutrinos which are not easily accessible in lab experiments .",
    "particularly the measurement of absolute neutrino masses from cmb and large scale structure data has received significant attention over the past few years . from cosmological observations it has been possible to derive an upper bound on the sum of neutrino masses which seems to be robustly in the 0.5 ev range .",
    "this is substantially better than the present bound from tritium decay measurements which is @xmath206 ev ( 95% c.l . ) , leading to @xmath207 ev .    in the future",
    "this type of measurement will be improved by more than an order of magnitude by the katrin experiment @xcite which has a projected sensitivity of 0.2 ev on the effective electron neutrino mass .",
    "another cornerstone of neutrino cosmology is the measurement of the total energy density in non - electromagnetically interacting particles . for many years",
    "big bang nucleosynthesis was the only probe of relativistic energy density , but with the advent of precision cmb and lss data it has been possible to complement the bbn measurement . at present the cosmic neutrino background is seen in both bbn , cmb and lss data at high significance , with @xmath208 being excluded at more than @xmath209 .    finally , cosmology can also be used to probe the possibility of neutrino warm dark matter , which could be produced by active - sterile neutrino oscillations .    in the coming years the steady stream of new observational data will continue , and the cosmological bounds on neutrino will improve accordingly . for instance , it has been estimated that with data from the upcoming planck satellite it could be possible to measure neutrino masses as low as 0.05 ev which would allow for a determination of the neutrino mass even in the normal hierarchy .",
