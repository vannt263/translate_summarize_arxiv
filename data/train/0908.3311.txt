    "the last stage solidification of alloys is a critical step in casting and welding processes during which several defects can form @xcite .",
    "in addition to porosity , the most severe of these defects is probably hot cracking , _ i.e. _ , a spontaneous failure of the material while it is still semi - solid .",
    "this defect , which typically occurs in dilute and hard alloys , limits the productivity of cast houses and restricts the range of alloys that can be produced .",
    "@xcite it also severely limits the weldability of this class of alloys .    in dilute alloys ,",
    "solid grains are separated by thin continuous liquid films up to high volume fraction of solid @xmath4 ( typically up to @xmath5 ) , especially at high angle grain boundaries , where coalescence of solid grains is made difficult by the large grain boundary energy@xcite .",
    "as stresses and strains are generated in the not yet fully coherent solid , the presence of these liquid films together with the low permeability of the mushy zone near @xmath6 , which prevents efficient feeding , makes the material extremely brittle .",
    "@xcite deformation induced by thermal and solidification shrinkage tends to localize at these liquid films , which act as a brittle phase .",
    "they pose little resistance to tensile strains and , as they open , the newly created volume can not be fed by intergranular liquid .",
    "the so called `` brittle range , '' meaning the @xmath4-range where the mushy zone exhibits low strength and low ductility , can be measured , for example , by tensile tests on partially solidified alloys .",
    "@xcite    accurate prediction of hot cracking requires the knowledge of :    1 .   the thermal history of the cast or welded part .",
    "this is usually done using volume - averaged multi - phase heat and mass transfer models @xcite ; 2 .",
    "realistic mechanical constitutive equations for the semi - solid alloy @xcite ; and 3 .   conditions under which a hot tear will form , also known as a hot cracking criterion @xcite .",
    "hot tearing models based on such data have been implemented successfully in casting simulation codes by several authors .",
    "@xcite    these existing models treat the material as a continuum whose properties are represented by volume - averaged quantities at a length scale that is large compared to the microstructure , and small compared to the variations of macroscopic fields . by their very construction , they can not include the important transitions in microstructure at high volume fraction solid , such as the localization of liquid films to the periphery of increasingly large grain clusters , as described by percolation theory .",
    "@xcite thus , the loss of locality of the length scale implies that no appropriate representative volume element can be defined .",
    "this limits the utility of such models , because it is in precisely this transition region that hot cracks form , as recently demonstrated experimentally by gourlay and dahle , emphasizing the importance of the granular nature of solidifying alloys .",
    "@xcite    in order to go beyond the limits imposed by the volume - averaged methods , in this work we adapt _ granular _ or _ discrete element models _",
    "( dem ) , which have been developed in the context of the mechanics of granular materials .",
    "@xcite these models simulate the behavior of a large number of spherical grains , which may be either rigid @xcite or deformable @xcite .",
    "they consider the interactions between the grains due to solid - solid contact but neglect the influence of the surrounding medium . to extend these models to the case of semi - solid alloys at high solid fraction",
    ", we must consider not only the solidification of each grain , but also the influence of fluid flow on the mechanical behavior of the mushy zone .",
    "the first model using the granular approach for the solidification and coalescence of globular grains in 2d was proposed by mathier _",
    "@xcite this work was further developed by two of the present authors .",
    "@xcite in @xcite , a percolation analysis was presented that identified the various transitions in the mushy zone that appear naturally in this approach , as well as a model for liquid feeding .",
    "however , all these contributions made the major assumption that the grains remained fixed . in the present contribution , we derive a 2d granular mechanical model for globular microstructure that includes both the flow of intergranular liquid and the displacement of solid grains .",
    "the 2d mechanical model that we present here is based on the solidification model presented in detail in previous publications .",
    "@xcite the model is appropriate for inoculated alloys whose final grain structure is fine and globular . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we briefly recall the main features of this solidification model before presenting the mechanical dem approach .    consider a population of grains distributed randomly in space with a specified average density .",
    "nucleation is assumed to be instantaneous , and the temperature difference across a typical grain is taken to be small compared to the undercooling , _",
    "i.e. _ , small thermal gradient .",
    "the final grain structure is therefore close to the voronoi tessellation of the original set of nuclei .",
    "@xcite beginning with a random distribution of nucleation centers , the voronoi tessellation of the set is computed from the mediatrix of the segments connecting two neighbor nucleation centers ( see fig .",
    "[ solidif ] ) . a 2d grain",
    "is then identified as an ensemble of triangles having the nucleation center as one corner and two vertices on the grain boundary .",
    "computation in the model proceeds in two steps . in the first step ,",
    "the interface of each grain during growth is approximated by a linear segment parallel to the grain boundary . in this step ,",
    "we neglect solute flux between elementary triangles , which reduces the solute diffusion calculation to a one - dimensional problem in each triangle .",
    "we assume complete mixing in the liquid . back - diffusion in the solid can be easily incorporated in the model .",
    "@xcite . in the second step ,",
    "the sharp corners of the polyhedral grains are smoothed using a procedure that accounts for the local curvature undercooling .",
    "further details of this model , together with a discussion of its limitations and domain of validity are given in ref .",
    "we begin the mechanical model with the microstructure computed by the solidification model .",
    "the idea is to derive a dem for the mechanical response of the mushy zone that retains the main physical aspects at the scale of the grains , yet is simple enough to be computationally tractable . to that end , the following assumptions are made :    1 .   _",
    "the grains are undeformable .",
    "_ this assumption is adequate to obtain insight into the physics of hot tearing , where deformations are small .",
    "a more complete model of the rheology of the mushy zone should also include deformation of the solid , which is known to be important for volume fractions of solid @xmath7 , known as the traction coherency solid fraction .",
    "2 .   _ grain movement can occur only by translation .",
    "_ this hypothesis seems very restrictive , but experimental studies have shown that at high temperature and high solid fraction , the most important deformation mechanism is grain boundary sliding .",
    "@xcite making this assumption greatly improves the computational efficiency of the model , because detection of contacts between polygonal grains is difficult if rotations are permitted .",
    "@xcite 3 .",
    "_ liquid channels smaller than a pre - defined coalescence interaction distance @xmath8 , on the order of a few nm , are taken to be fully solid .",
    "using such a cut - off improves the computational behavior of the model by eliminating very large coefficients that would otherwise appear in the matrix of the linear system derived in sect .",
    "[ sect : global ] .",
    "_ the intergranular fluid is newtonian and incompressible , and no - slip conditions apply at the solid - liquid ( @xmath9 ) interface . _",
    "we adopt this constitutive model for the fluid even though the channels between grain are very thin .",
    "we note that measurements by israelachvili showed that the viscosity observed in bulk samples is still valid for films as thin as 5 nm .",
    "another effect observed in thin films is slipping at @xmath9 interfaces which may be due to the formation of a nanometer scale air gap .",
    "@xcite this phenomenon occurs when the shear stress exceeds a critical value , and might be an interesting phenomenon to consider in hot tearing , especially if gas porosity appears at grain boundaries .",
    "it is not included in this work .",
    "our model considers the liquid network formed between the grains .",
    "the basic element is a liquid channel surrounded by two solid grains , designated @xmath10 and @xmath11 in fig .",
    "[ solidif ] .",
    "the element has four integration points .",
    "the first two points are the grain centers , denoted @xmath12 and @xmath13 for grains @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively . at these points , we consider two conjugate vector quantities , the velocity of the grain @xmath14 ( or @xmath15 ) and the force exerted by the grain on a liquid channel @xmath16 ( or @xmath17 ) .",
    "the two other integration points are the ends of the liquid channel , denoted @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the conjugate quantities considered at these points are the fluid flux @xmath20 ( or @xmath21 ) and the pressure @xmath22 ( or @xmath23 ) .",

    "relative translation between neighboring grains can produce a mismatch at the extremities of the channel .",
    "with reference to fig .",
    "[ solidif ] , we introduce the following length measures : @xmath26 is the length of the @xmath9 interface for one channel , @xmath27 is the length of the channel where the two grains effectively face each other , and @xmath28 is the length of the @xmath9 interface from the center of the channel to the extremity of grain @xmath10 near vertex @xmath19 .",
    "we also define @xmath29 .",
    "the half - width of the channel is designated as @xmath30 .",
    "note also that even though the channel can be curved at its extremities , it is modeled with straight lines for the calculation of the pressure field .",

    "[ contact ] .    the volume change associated with solidification shrinkage , _ i.e. _ , due to the density difference ( @xmath32 ) between the solid and liquid phases , produces a compensating flow in the liquid near the interface .",
    "it is most convenient to develop the expressions for the flow in terms of the normal and tangential components of the velocity , denoted with superscripts `` @xmath33 '' and `` @xmath34 '' , respectively @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the solidification shrinkage @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the speed of the @xmath9 interface as given by the solidification model .",
    "we choose the element normal vector @xmath39 to point toward the liquid from grain @xmath10 , and the tangential vector @xmath40 is directed from vertex @xmath18 to vertex @xmath19 .",

    "@xmath56 has the usual parabolic profile given by @xmath57 thus , the volumetric flow rate at the vertices @xmath18 and @xmath19 is given by : @xmath58 this equation describes the flow between two parallel planes . in 2d ,",
    "any contact between neighboring grains blocks all flow in the channel , whereas in 3d the liquid can flow around the contact . to include this important 3d feature in our 2d model",
