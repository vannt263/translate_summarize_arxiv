    "magnetospheres exhibit various intriguing phenomena .",
    "a representative example is plasma density profile with planet - ward gradient  @xcite .",
    "such a self - organized structure is an apparent counterexample of the entropy principle .",
    "the inward diffusion theory has successfully explained the self - organization mechanism in a magnetosphere ; diffusion triggered by violation of a third adiabatic invariant flattens their density on magnetic coordinates rather than cartesian coordinates@xcite , resulting in nonuniform density distribution on cartesian coordinates .",
    "such a nonuniform density profile was experimentally observed in the ring trap 1 ( rt-1 )  @xcite and levitated dipole experiment ( ldx )  @xcite .",
    "another interesting self - organization phenomenon in magnetosphere is plasma heating by inward diffusion .",
    "particles are energized along with the inward ( i.e. , toward strong magnetic field region ) transport keeping first and second adiabatic invariants constant .",
    "the conservation of the first adiabatic invariant increases the particle s perpendicular kinetic energy ( betatron acceleration ) and the conservation of the second results in the increase in parallel energy ( fermi acceleration )  @xcite .",
    "these are the primary generation mechanism for planetary radiation belts . in point",
    "dipole field configuration , betatron acceleration is stronger than fermi acceleration because increase rate of magnetic field strength upon the planet - ward displacement is greater than the decrease rate of longitudinal bounce length .",
    "therefore accelerated particle exhibits temperature anisotropy ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "recently we observed ion temperature anisotropy in rt-1 and proved that the anisotropy was produced by the betatron acceleration  @xcite .    in this study , we found similar temperature anisotropy in the broad component of h@xmath0 line by doppler spectroscopy .",
    "broad component of h@xmath0 line has been observed in astrophysical and laboratory plasmas . in astrophysics ,",
    "balmer lines emitted around shocks in supernova remnants show clear narrow and broad components .",
    "the broad component is attributed to hot hydrogen particles produced through charge exchange between post - shock protons .",
    "the narrow component originates in cold hydrogen atoms in pre - shock interstellar medium  @xcite .",
    "the post shock proton temperature is estimated by doppler broadening of the broad component",
    ". broad component of balmer lines has also been observed in laboratory plasma  @xcite .",
    "in addition to narrow and broad components , the recent studies identified threefold ( cold , warm and hot ) balmer lines  @xcite .",
    "the one - dimensional neutral particle transport model clarified that the hot component was generated by charge exchange with protons  @xcite . unlike in the case of astrophysical plasma",
    ", it is challenging to infer proton temperature via doppler temperature of a broad component in laboratory .",
    "the preceding studies observed discrepancies between the proton temperature and the doppler temperature of the broad component  @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy originates in other processes which generate hot neutrals , such as dissociation and reflection .",
    "however , the recent study succeeded to estimate proton temperature from h@xmath0 line shape by separating charge exchange contribution from other competitive processes  @xcite . therefore , our observation of the temperature anisotropy in the broad component has the potential to estimate proton temperature anisotropy .",
    "the experiment was performed on rt-1 device which simulates a ` laboratory magnetosphere ' by a levitated superconducting magnet  @xcite .",
    "plasma is generated by the electron cyclotron resonance heating ( ech ) using an 8.2ghz microwave .",
    "the discharge duration is about 1s .",
    "the electron density distribution ( measured by three chord interferometers ) has a peak near the dipole magnet and decreases toward outer wall  @xcite . the electron density at the peak is on the order of @xmath2 .",

    "the population of hot electron is approximately the same as that of cold electrons",
    ". the heating mechanisms of ions are the thermal equilibration with cold electrons and the betatron acceleration , and the cooling mechanism is charge exchange with neutrals  @xcite .",
    "we measured visible spectra using a czerny-turner spectrometer ( 1 m focal length , 2400grooves / mm grating , and 0.55nm / mm reciprocal linear dispersion ) equipped with a charge - coupled device ( ccd ) detector ( 1024 @xmath4 256 pixels ) .",

    "the line of sights for the three sets of doppler spectroscopies ( ( a ) one vertical chord and ( b ) two horizontal chords ) are shown . the vertical chord consisted of three fixed channels ( 548 mm , 840 mm , and 925 mm ) and one rotating channel which scanned @xmath5 mm ( `` vertical chord '' in fig .",

    "the horizontal chord consisted of three fixed channels ( 772 mm , 841 mm , and 925 mm ) and two rotating channels .",

    "the absolute value of the doppler shift was estimated by combination of horizontal chord 1 and 2 : for a given radial point , unshifted central wavelength is obtained by midpoint of spectra measured by chord 1 and 2 assuming axisymmetric property .",

    "the radial profile of the temperature and the toroidal velocity of hot neutrals were spatially inhomogeneous , whereas the cold component had flat profiles .",

    "even though the preceding studies already observed the hot neutral flow  @xcite , the observation of the temperature anisotropy in hot neutrals is the very first .",
    "the dependencies of hot neutral temperature and anisotropy were consistent with ions .",
    "since hot neutrals emitting a broad component are mainly produced by charge exchange between neutrals and protons  @xcite , the flow and the anisotropy were inherited from protons .",
    "therefore , our observation is the evidence of proton temperature anisotropy in rt-1 .",
    "although the discrepancy between hot neutrals and impurity ions suggests that hot neutrals are not identical to protons , anisotropy in broad component may be a technique to estimate proton temperature anisotropy with help from precise analysis of line shape because the preceding study proved that separation of charge exchange contribution from competitive processes enables us to evaluate proton temperature  @xcite .",
    "now , let us discuss the locality of the present observation .",
    "we may consider three scenarios for h@xmath0 emission through charge exchange .",
    "@xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 here , we consider only resonance charge exchange processes because cross section of non - resonance charge exchange is much smaller .",
    "the process ( [ e:3->3 ] ) is resonance charge exchange of @xmath21 level .",
    "then , spontaneous emission of h@xmath0 de - excites the charge exchanged atoms to @xmath22 level .",
    "since the spontaneous emission of @xmath23 occurs in @xmath24 s , the travel distance of hot neutral with 6ev from charge exchange to spontaneous emission is 0.5 mm , implying the sufficient locality for this scenario .",
    "the process ( [ e:2->3 ] ) is resonance charge exchange of @xmath22 level followed by electron impact excitation to @xmath21 level .",
    "then , spontaneous emission of h@xmath0 will occur . however , this scenario is not plausible because the electron impact excitation time ( calculated as @xmath25s from @xmath26 and @xmath27ev  @xcite ) is significantly shorter than the time of the spontaneous emission @xmath28 ( @xmath29 s ) .",
    "therefore , almost all the charge exchanged atoms in @xmath22 level go down to the ground level instantly .",
    "the process ( [ e:1->3 ] ) is charge exchange of ground level followed by electron impact excitation to @xmath21 level .",
    "the cross section of the resonance charge exchange in @xmath30 level is approximately ten times smaller than that of the resonance charge exchange in @xmath21 level  @xcite .",
    "the time of the electron impact excitation @xmath31 is @xmath32s  @xcite .",
    "the travel distance of hot neutral with 6ev is 50 m , which is incomparably larger than the device size .",
    "also , the cross section of electron impact ionization ( @xmath33 ) is approximately ten times larger than that of excitation ( @xmath34 )  @xcite , and thereby the charge exchanged neutrals at @xmath30 level will be ionized before excitation to @xmath21 level .",
    "these estimates suggests that the process ( [ e:1->3 ] ) is rare for a single neutral particle .",
    "however , since the number of the ground state neutrals is much larger than that of @xmath21 state neutrals before charge exchange , the contribution of the process ( [ e:1->3 ] ) is not negligible .",
    "therefore , both of the scenarios ( [ e:3->3 ] ) and ( [ e:1->3 ] ) are feasible , and we have yet to determine which of the processes is governing . because the spatial resolution of the process ( [ e:1->3 ] ) is equivalent to the device size , the contribution of this process is , at most , only `` uniform background '' temperature in fig .",
    "[ f : profile](a ) .",
    "the peaks of fig .",
    "[ f : profile ] ( a ) and ( c ) are attributed to the process ( [ e:3->3 ] ) , and the spatial resolution is @xmath35 mm near the peaks .",
    "precise numerical simulation of neutral particle transport is necessary for further discussions .    in closing , we remark the comparison with tokamak configuration .",
    "the preceding experiment in tokamak configuration measured the doppler temperature of broad component from multiple directions which are tangential and perpendicular to toroidal magnetic field  @xcite in the similar manner as the present study .",
    "the observed broad component in h@xmath0 was precisely isotropic .",
    "therefore , an anisotropy in broad component is distinctive to magnetospheric configuration .",
