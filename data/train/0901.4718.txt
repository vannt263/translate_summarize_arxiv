    "based on these assumptions , the spectrum is described in terms of 4 parameters , namely : the slope of the electron distribution @xmath52 , the maximum and the minimum energy of emitting particles @xmath53 and the magnetic field , because we fixed the volume derived from the radio maps .",

    "the maximum energy of particles has been evaluated in order to see the synchrotron exponential cut - off in the uv , as suggested by the data .",
    "finally , given the value of the magnetic field and assuming a minimum observed frequency of 10@xmath1hz , we derived the @xmath54 parameter for both electron distribution ( see tab .",

    "we find a good agreement of our solution with the observed spectrum for a magnetic field of 180 @xmath21 g for s3.7 and 195 @xmath21 g for s11.3 .",
    "parameters for our model are reported in table  [ tab:17sync ] .    for an inverse compton ( ic ) model using photons of the microwave background ( cmb ) we follow the formalism of harris & krawczynski ( 2002 ) . for s3.7 , we find that the required beaming factor is @xmath55=8 for the fiducial condition @xmath56 ( @xmath57 is the bulk lorentz factor of the jet knot ) .",

    "since the jet is obviously curved , there is no expectation that the two values of @xmath58 should be equal even if one might guess that s11.3 would be moving more towards us than s3.7 .",
    "these estimates are very rough because of the poor signal to noise in the x - ray data and because we do not have a measure of the radio spectral index .",

    "however , since we do nt know how to estimate the probability that the ( upstream ) invisible jet just happens to start converting some of its power into relativistic electrons and b field at this location , and since we are wary of _ a posteriori _ probabilities , the chance alignment hypothesis seems unlikely , but remains a possibility .",
    "* the emitting region arises from the interaction of the jet and some pre - existing entity ( e.g. a large hi cloud , only a part of which gets ionized and produces free - free emission ) .",
    "this hypothesis can be tested with an optical spectrum since the most likely method of creating optical emission from the interaction of a jet and cold gas would be via ionization leading to recombination lines and an optically thin continuum .",
    "since the observed spectrum is inconsistent with free - free emission from an ionized gas at @xmath73k , it would have to be dominated by emission lines .",
    "the two observed bands correspond to 1.27 - 1.36 @xmath21 and 5452 - 6387 angstroms at the redshift of 3c  17 .",
    "neither of these bands would be expected to contain the more likely emission lines envisaged by this scenario . *",
    "the emitting region comes from an unknown property of the jet . to our knowledge ,",
    "no other jet exhibits such a narrow band feature perpendicular to its axis .",
    "* the object is indeed an edge on spiral and is a close companion of 3c  17 .",
    "the jet pierces the center of this galaxy and that is why the jet begins to be visible at this location .",
    "this jet , like all one sided jets , is coming mostly towards us : perhaps 10@xmath25 - 30@xmath25 to the l.o.s .",
    "for this section of the jet . since the edge on spiral s plane is perpendicular to the plane of the sky , the actual impacting jet will be close to hitting the plane of the galaxy at an oblique angle , not coming in at the pole , as it appears in the projected view . in any event the probability of hitting an object whose s center subtends 1 kpc@xmath74 ( as seen from the smbh of 3c  17 ) by chance is @xmath75 ( again , an _ a posteriori _ probability ) .    if we refuse to allow intent ( e.g. intergalactic engineering ) , we are left with an improbable chance alignment , an interaction with some pre - existing entity , or some new type of jet - related emission .",
    "an optical spectrum of this object could eliminate some of these possibilities .",
    "most jets that have been well studied are relatively straight and the assumption is normally made that @xmath58 , the angle to the l.o.s . , does not change along the jet .",
    "a curving jet provides an advantage because a changing viewing angle should be reflected in the run of the ratio , r , of x - ray to radio intensities differently for synchrotron and ic emissions .",
    "if , and only if , the x - ray emission is dominated by ic / cmb emission will the emitting regions closer to the line of sight than the others display anomalously large values of r.    in x - ray synchrotron jets , r is often a sharply decreasing function of distance down the jet ( `` class 1 '' e.g. 3c273 , jester et al .",
    "2006 ) , and we normally ascribe this to a decreasing ability to produce electrons of the required energies ( possibly caused by an increasing magnetic field strength ) . in other straight jets normally thought to be representative of ic / cmb x - ray emission , the ratio may decrease smoothly ( mimicking the synchrotron ) or is sensibly constant down the jet ( `` class 2 '' e.g. 4c19.44 , schwartz et al .",
    "normally these two possibilities are ascribed to a smoothly decelerating flow ( thereby diminishing the ic component ) or a relatively uniform value for @xmath57 which would maintain the effective energy density of the cmb .    for a curved jet with changing @xmath58 , there may be anomalous changes in synchrotron brightness associated with the effect of @xmath58 on @xmath55 ( the beaming factor ) , but the ratio of x - ray to radio emission should be preserved and remain unaffected by changing @xmath58 . in the ic / cmb scenario , the critical point is that a smaller @xmath58 will lead to a marked change in r ( unlike the synchrotron case ) , deviating either from the smoothly decreasing ratio or from a constant ratio .",
    "the knot s11.3 is brighter than adjacent knots in all 3 bands ( radio , optical , and x - rays ) .",
    "is this because it is where the curving jet lies closest to the l.o.s . or",
    "is it just an intrinsically stronger emitting region which might be caused by a longer path length at a tangential point ?",
    "the longer pathlength possibility will again not disturb the intrinsic x - ray / radio behavior for either emission mechanism , so if we can show that s11.3 has an anomalously large ratio , it will be a strong indicator that the x - ray emission process is ic / cmb .    for ic / cmb emission , the preference for ic scattering when the electrons are meeting the photons head - on in the jet frame , produces more ic emission in the downstream direction . the angular dependency of this extra beaming term is given in eq .",
    "( a22 ) of harris & krawczynski ( 2002 ) and with a few substitutions can be written as :    @xmath76    where @xmath57 is the bulk lorentz factor of the emitting region and @xmath77 .",
    "this function is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] for a few representative values of @xmath57 .",
    "although our data for 3c  17 are inadequate to perform a meaningful test , current parameters are given in table  [ tab : ratio ] as an illustration of the method . while it is true that r is larger for s11.3 than for the adjoining knots , r(s3.7 ) is more than twice r(s11.3 ) . to sustain an ic / cmb explanation for the x - rays of both knots , it becomes necessary to posit a smaller value of @xmath57 for the outer parts of the jet compared to that ascribed to s3.7 .",
    "that would mean that the @xmath78 term in eq.(a22 ) ( _ ibid _ ) would dominate the change in r between s3.7 and s11.3 .",
    "in the present context the beaming parameters for s3.7 could be ( see   [ sec : results ] ) @xmath79=8 , @xmath58=7@xmath25 while at s11.3 , @xmath57=5.4 , @xmath55=5.4 , and @xmath58=10@xmath25 and in this case , the angular dependence is not the dominant effect .",

    "<S> we report on the x - ray emission from the radio jet of 3c  17 from _ chandra _  observations and compare the x - ray emission with radio maps from the vla archive and with the optical - ir archival images from the hubble space telescope . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray detections of two knots in the 3c  17 jet are found and both of these features have optical counterparts . we derive the spectral energy distribution for the knots in the jet and give source parameters required for the various x - ray emission models , finding that both ic / cmb and synchrotron are viable to explain the high energy emission . </S>",
    "<S> a curious optical feature ( with no radio or x - ray counterparts ) possibly associated with the 3c  17 jet is described . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the use of curved jets for the problem of identifying inverse compton x - ray emission via scattering on cmb photons . </S>"
