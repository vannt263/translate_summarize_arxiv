    "the one - way model for quantum computation  @xcite , or measurement - based quantum computation ( mbqc ) , is an alternative to the standard circuit model  @xcite , providing another possible route towards practical quantum information processing . in this scheme ,",
    "quantum computation proceeds by adaptive single - qubit measurement on an entangled universal resource state .",
    "particular physical implementations , however , may necessitate modifying the original scheme , which used a cluster state @xcite on the @xmath0-dimensional square lattice as its universal resource .",
    "other resource states that have been identified as universal under this measurement - based scheme include the cluster state corresponding to a @xmath0-dimensional hexagonal lattice  @xcite , and , in addition , other extended measurement - based schemes have been proposed  @xcite . in this paper , rather than searching for classes of universal states , we consider the impact of possible experimental imperfections on the resource states to see if universal mbqc can be achieved . we also show that our model exhibits a phase transition in the computational power of the resource state , in the sense that its potential for universal quantum computation is lost suddenly at a particular critical degree of imperfection .",
    "the notion of universality we use throughout is that of _ efficient _ universality ( in the sense of ref .",
    "@xcite ) i.e. that any quantum computation can be implemented with only a polynomial overhead in spatial resources and time,)-sized quantum circuits on @xmath1 qubits can be generated using a resource state of size poly(@xmath1 ) , and in time poly(@xmath1 ) ( both in terms of quantum measurements and classical side - processing ) .",
    "] as efficiency is a crucial aspect of computational power .",
    "typically , one imagines a cluster state as being prepared by placing qubits in an @xmath2 lattice and then entangling the qubits with an ising type interaction between nearest neighbours .",
    "the model we consider in this paper is one in which there is only a finite probability @xmath3 that there was initially an atom in any given lattice site .",
    "the value of @xmath3 is independent and identical for each lattice site .",
    "we could imagine this situation arising when we fill an optical lattice with atoms from a mott - insulator with some sub - unital filling factor @xcite .",
    "we assume there is only at most one atom per site , and furthermore that the atom positions are heralded .",
    "the resulting state looks like a regular lattice graph state , but with some vertices and their incident edges removed .",
    "percolation is the widely - known phenomenon that in lattices with imperfect filling there exists a unique giant connected cluster of size @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 ) , when the filling factor lies above a certain percolation threshold ( in the so - called supercritical phase ) .",
    "one might naively think it is obvious that above this threshold the corresponding state in our model would be universal as a resource of mbqc .",
    "however , a connected graph state of size @xmath4 is generally not sufficient to be a universal resource .",
    "for example , a 1d chain ( i.e. , 1d cluster state ) of @xmath4 is not universal , nor is any @xmath4 tree structure nor even the complete graph on @xmath6 vertices @xcite . in this paper , we show that the faulty lattice is indeed universal by showing explicitly how to convert the supercritical resource state into the regular 2d cluster state with constant overhead ( dependent only on @xmath3 ) and polynomial - time classical processing .    finally , we interpret the transition to universality at the percolation threshold as a phase transition , with the entanglement of the faulty lattice as an order parameter .",
    "specifically , we use an entanglement measure called the _ entanglement width _",
    "@xcite which is well suited as an entanglement measure for states being used in mbqc .",
    "we show that the scaling exponent of the entanglement width of the faulty lattice goes through a discontinuity at the critical probability @xmath7 in the large @xmath6 limit .",
    "it should be noted that in this paper all statistical statements , such as discussion of phase transitions , should be interpreted in the following way .",
    "we consider properties that hold true almost surely ( more precisely , with probability exponentially close to one in the thermodynamic limit ) , for all the possible realizations of the configuration of holes with a given @xmath3 .",
    "this paper does not directly consider mixed states , although clearly the mixed state corresponding to a mixture of states weighted according to their probability for a given @xmath3 , would reduce to the same ensemble of pure states under a non - demolition site - occupation number measurement .",
    "we briefly mention the literature which utilized the idea of percolation theory for the quantum information processing .",
    "a simple modification of the situation above is to consider the effect when all lattice sites are filled with an atom but the entangling gate fails with some probability , leading to a graph state with missing edges instead of vertices .",
    "this is the model considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , motivated by linear optical implementations of quantum computation . in that paper the authors consider an initial faulty resource of size @xmath8 , a @xmath9-dimensional resource , and show that above the edge percolation threshold for a @xmath9d lattice , it is possible to concentrate an @xmath10 hexagonal cluster state .",
    "the approach used in refs .",
    "@xcite is derived from renormalization theory and is applicable to a wide variety of lattice geometries , and may also be adapted to work with vertex defects , rather than edge defects .",
    "we note that in the context of quantum networks , on the other hand , classical percolation methods were not found to be optimal @xcite .",
    "because this paper relies on results from rather distinct disciplines , this section provides the necessary background for readers who may be unfamiliar with one or more topics .",

    "a _ graph _",
    "@xmath11 is a set of points , called _ vertices _ , along with a set of pairs of vertices which are called _",
    "edges_. vertices are usually labeled with numbers , such as vertex @xmath12 , and edges are usually labeled by the vertices they connect , such as edge @xmath13 that connects vertices @xmath12 and @xmath14 .",
    "the vertices @xmath12 and @xmath14 are sometimes said to be the _",
    "endpoints _ of the edge , or be _ connected _ by the edge , and also sometimes the edge is said to be _ incident _ on vertices @xmath12 and @xmath14 .",
    "a graph is represented pictorially with dots representing vertices and lines connecting the dots representing edges .",
    "two vertices connected by an edge are said to be _ neighbors _ , and the number of neighbors of a vertex is dubbed its _",
    "degree_. the _ neighborhood _ of vertex @xmath12 , denoted as @xmath15 , is the set of vertices that are neighbors of vertex @xmath12 .",
    "the neighborhood of a set of vertices is the union of the neighborhoods of the vertices in the set ( excluding the vertices themselves ) .",
    "a _ path _ in @xmath11 is an ordered set of vertices and their connecting edges , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and each vertex and edge appear exactly once .",
    "thus , paths have no `` dangling '' edges and can not self - intersect .",
    "the first and last vertices in the path are the _ starting _ and _ ending _ vertices , respectively .",
    "there are two more important concepts we need to define : graph minors and topological minors .",
    "these are illustrated in figure  [ f : minor ] .",
    "graph minor _ , or simply minor , is obtained by first partitioning the vertices into disjoint connected sets , and then considering the graph between these sets , while disregarding any self - loops or parallel edges ; see figure  [ f : minor](a ) .",
    "topological minor _ is a special case of a graph minor where the resulting minor has the same topology as the original graph .",
    "more precisely , if we view the original graph as a topological space , a topological minor is homeomorphic to the original graph .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ f : minor](b ) . for a rigorous definition of these concepts ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the universal resource states we address are called _ graph states _",
    "@xcite and are defined in terms of a graph @xmath11 as follows .",
    "let @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 denote the pauli operators on the @xmath12-th qubit . for each vertex @xmath12 of the graph @xmath11",
    ", prepare a qubit initially in the @xmath22 eigenstate of @xmath19 .",
    "then apply the controlled - z operator between each pair of qubits who are neighbors in @xmath11 . for a connected graph , what results is an entangled pure quantum state that is well represented by the underlying graph @xmath11 .",
    "the class of graph states resulting from @xmath0d regular lattices are called _",
    "cluster states_. the two lattices that we use are the square lattice and the hexagonal lattice .",
    "both have been shown to be universal for one - way quantum computation @xcite .",
    "there are three types of errors : _ closeness _ errors , _ degree _ errors and _ lattice _ errors .",
    "a closeness error occurs when a path gets too close to itself or another path .",
    "a degree error is where a vertex is not degree three , as is proper for a hexagonal lattice . a lattice error happens when the global topology is not that of a regular hexagonal lattice .",
    "additionally , the first two error classes are subdivided according to what type of paths or degrees are involved , as explained below .",
    "* _ self - h _ errors , where a single horizontal path gets too close to itself .",
    "similarly , there are _ self - v _ errors . *",
    "_ h - h _ errors , where a horizontal path gets too close to another disjoint horizontal path . similarly",
    ", there are _ v - v _ errors . * _ h - v _ errors , where a horizontal path gets too close to a vertical path , except for a single intersection .",
    "degree errors are also subdivided . at the end of the entire algorithm",
    ", we want every vertex to be degree 3 ( except on the boundary of the lattice , which is dealt with separately ) .",
    "thus , we need to eliminate vertices of degrees 1,2 and 4 . _",
    "degree 1 _ errors correspond to `` dangling '' qubits while _ degree 2 _ errors correspond to `` wires '' , both of which can be contracted by measuring  @xmath23 .",
    "while these are handled in the quantum stage of the algorithm , _ degree 4 _ errors are handled in the classical stage .      as discussed in section  [ s : overview ] , the classical part of our algorithm proceeds in three main stages : path identification , error localization , and correction of local errors .",
    "after this is complete , we will have identified a subset of the qubits whose topology is that of a hexagonal lattice , and the quantum part of the algorithm ( discussed in the next subsection ) will contract this lattice into a hexagonal lattice cluster state .",
    "as discussed in subsection  [ s : vertexdisjoint ] , we know that there exists @xmath24 vertex - disjoint h- and v - paths . the wall follower algorithm defined above will necessarily find all these paths since it finds boundary paths @xcite . for the h - paths , we use the 2-local version of rhwf and for the v - paths , we use rhwf , but keep only every third path . clearly then we do not have h - h or v - v errors . to eliminate self errors",
    "we simply find the shortest path amongst the original vertices and their accompanying internal edge sets , which can only contain degree @xmath25 and @xmath0 vertices and hence no self errors .",
    "taking the shortest path also can not introduce any closeness errors because we do not add any vertices , we only delete them .",
    "thus we have shown that after stage c.1 of the algorithm we have identified @xmath24 valid h- and v - paths .    , while the blue lines are the bridges incident on @xmath26 for two vertical paths , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the solid blue line is associated with the index @xmath14 , while the dashed line is associated with @xmath29 .",
    "closures of upper and lower abutments are denoted by black circles . in ( a ) and ( b )",
    ", we assume the closures of the upper and lower abutments are disjoint , but that the total abutments overlap . in case ( c ) ,",
    "we treat the possibility that the upper or lower abutment closures themselves overlap .",
    "note that , while the case of complete containment is not illustrated as a sub - case of ( c ) , it is still treated in the text.,width=302 ]    once this is done , we can find the complete bridge decomposition as defined above .",
    "since we do this by removing vertices while preserving connectivity , this process clearly does not introduce any new closeness errors .",
    "this step also localizes h - v errors to the region near the abutments as in fig .",
    "[ f : abutments - ordered ] .",
    "the next step is to take an _ alternating bridge decomposition _ , which is defined as follows .",
    "in a @xmath12-stripe we can delete the bridges @xmath30 such that @xmath31 has odd parity , which is alternating in the sense that we take alternating bridges as indexed by @xmath12 and @xmath14 .",
    "we want to show that the alternating bridge decomposition is also alternating in a stronger , topological sense .",
    "we do this by showing below that the natural partial ordering on the abutments is actually a total ordering ; that is , each pair of abutments along an h - path can be compared . intuitively , then",
    ", the global topology of the lattice is that of a square lattice except for possible errors localized to the abutments .",
    "taking alternating bridges will then clearly give a hexagonal lattice .",
    "this intuition is illustated in fig .",
    "[ f : abutments - ordered ] .    showing that abutments are totally ordered ( as sets ) follows from showing that closures of abutments are disjoint .",
    "we show that they are disjoint by considering the various ways they might overlap and showing that each can not occur .",
    "this leaves several configurations , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : total - order ] .    .",
    "horizontal paths are colored red , and their 1- and 2-neighborhoods are colored different shades of yellow .",
    "( we only highlight neighborhoods that are used in the proof . )",
    "vertical paths are denoted by black and/or blue .",
    "stage c.1 of the algorithm keeps only the vertical path with the blue bridges , and stage c.2 keeps only the bridges from this path .",
    "there is no room for the dashed line to create a bridge in the upper stripe that would result in an error of the form depicted in figure  [ f : total - order](b.2).,width=302 ]      the only possible configuration for fig .",
    "[ f : total - order](b.2 ) is more carefully illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : bridges - alternate ] .",
    "the fact that this is the only possible configuration follows from first considering figure  [ f : total - order](b.2 ) and drawing in the two v - paths that were deleted in stage c.1 . because the configuration in figure  [ f : total - order](a.2 ) ca nt happen",
    ", we must draw figure  [ f : bridges - alternate ] so that the bridges connect as shown .",
    "the v - path furthest to the right can not go any lower without creating a new , further right , bridge .",
    "the next furthest v - path must lie along the middle h - path , because if it went any lower , then rhwf would have found that lower path when identifying the middle h - path .",
    "( this is nt an issue for the furthest right v - path because it enters the 2-neighborhood of the lowest h - path . )",
    "the last existing v - path can not intersect the others , and so must remain at least as high as shown in figure  [ f : bridges - alternate ] .",
    "therefore this configuration is exhaustive .",
    "we now show that the configuration in figure  [ f : bridges - alternate ] leads to a contradiction , and so case ( b.2 ) can not occur . since in stage c.1 of the algorithm , we take every third path , the two black vertical paths necessarily exist and do nt contribute bridges . to obtain a diagram like that in fig .",
    "[ f : total - order](b.2 ) , we would need a fourth vertical path , the assumed dashed blue line , that has the following property : its bridge in the lower stripe must lie to left of the lower blue bridge , while its bridge in the upper stripe must lie to the right of that same lower blue bridge . to form a bridge in the appropriate place in the upper stripe , this assumed fourth path would need to pass through the neighborhood of the middle h - path .",
    "but since v - paths are nt allowed to cross , this neighborhood is blocked by one of the deleted ( black ) v - paths .",
    "therefore , case ( b.2 ) can not occur .",
    "figure  [ f : total - order](c.1 ) breaks into the three non - trivial cases in figure  [ f : three - cases ] .",
    "they are enumerated by the length @xmath32 of the closure of the lower abutment for the solid blue bridge . for case",
    "[ f : three - cases](a ) , where @xmath33 , there is a clear contradiction with the requirement of keeping every third v - path .",
    "likewise for case [ f : three - cases](b ) , where @xmath34 . for case",
    "[ f : three - cases](c ) , which cover all cases with @xmath35 , it becomes slightly more complicated .",
    "the argument that this ca nt happen is very similar to that discussed above for figure  [ f : total - order](b.2 ) .",
    "the essential point is that keeping every third v - path does nt leave enough space for this kind of error .",
    "thus , the case depicted in figure  [ f : total - order](c.1 ) does nt happen either .",
    "( c.1 ) . in configuration ( a ) ,",
    "where @xmath33 , there is a clear violation of the requirement that we have kept every third path . in ( b ) , where @xmath34 , regardless of which dashed path is chosen there is again not enough room for two more v - paths . finally ,",
    "in case ( c ) , which covers all @xmath35 , we have the dreaded octopus configuration .",
    ", width=302 ]    finally , we have case ( c.2 ) . since we have kept only every third vertical path , neighborhoods of identified v - paths can not overlap .",
    "for case ( c.2 ) to occur , the horizontal path would have to enter the neighborhood of the dashed blue bridge , _ then leave it _ before entering the neighborhood of the solid blue bridge .",
    "but in order to create an error like ( c.2 ) , it would have to _ re - enter _ the neighborhood of the dashed blue bridge .",
    "this is a contradiction , since then the h - path would either have to cross itself ( eliminated in stage c.1 ) or a bridge ( not possible by the definition of a bridge ) .",
    "thus we conclude that the closures of the abutments are indeed disjoint and taking alternating bridges gives a hexagonal lattice structure , up to errors localized to the abutments . in other words , the graph minor achieved by collapsing the region near the abutment",
    "has a topological minor which is exactly a regular hexagonal lattice .",
    "thus , if we can transform these regions to have exactly the topology of a single local vertex in a hexagonal lattice , then the quantum part of the algorithm will succeed .",
    "now the only step left for the classical stage is to fix the local h - v errors in the region of the abutments . to do this , we can actually enumerate the possibilities .",
    "first observe that all vertices in an abutment are degree @xmath9 , other vertices in an h - path are degree @xmath0 , and the endpoint ( or starting point ) of a bridge , @xmath36 ( or @xmath37 ) is either degree @xmath0 , @xmath9 , or @xmath38 . there is no lattice error if there is one vertex in the region near an abutment of degree @xmath9 and the rest are degree @xmath0 .",
    "therefore if @xmath36 has degree @xmath0 there is no problem ; the only degree 3 vertex in this local region is the single vertex belonging to the abutment .    in the other cases , where @xmath36 has degree 3 or 4",
    ", we can eliminate the errors in the following manner .",
    "first delete everything in the h - path that lies in the closure of the abutment _ except _ for the endpoints of the abutment .",
    "then , by adding the endpoint of the bridge to the remaining vertices , we once again have a valid h - path , which additionally has no h - v errors , since the only degree 3 vertex is now the endpoint of the bridge , which is now considered as part of the h - path .",
    "although we have done this procedure for the endpoints , we can also do it for the starting points .",
    "both of these points can be done separately , since bridges always have distinct starting and ending vertices as a consequence of using the 2-local rhwf .",
    "one final subtle point is that , when the reconfiguration is done for both the start and end of the bridge , this might result in an h - h error .",
    "because of the restricted nature of these h - h errors , these errors do not affect the global topology ; in fact , an example of this subtlety is present in fig .",
    "[ f : algorithm ] .",
    "the quantum part of the algorithm is straightforward compared to the classical part . as stated before , we simply measure @xmath18 on vertices that were not identified in the classical part , thus disconnecting them",
    ". then we measure @xmath23 on the remaining degree 1 or 2 vertices , which will topologically contract the lattice .",
    "the only delicate part is the boundary , where we should leave one additional vertex present between each bridge in the h - paths , so that we have a true hexagonal lattice .",
    "a valid vertex is always available because we take every third v - path .",
    "[ [ the - existance - of - mathcal - ol - vertex - disjoint - crossingssvertexdisjoint ] ] the existance of @xmath39 vertex - disjoint crossings[s : vertexdisjoint ] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    we argue that we can expect @xmath39 vertex - disjoint crossings in both the horizontal and vertical directions .",
    "let us consider the event ( increasing with respect to @xmath3 ) that there exists a path between the one side and the opposite side in the 2d square grid .",
    "denote by @xmath40 the maximal number of vertex - disjoint paths crossing the 2d square grid of size @xmath41 from one side to the other .    according to a basic result in independent percolation , in the supercritical phase @xmath42 , the event such that at least a single crossing path exists happens with probability @xmath43 , for some @xmath44 , that is , almost surely in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the existence of a crossing is stable with respect to changes in any @xmath45 or fewer sites if there exists at least @xmath46 vertex - disjoint crossings . in order to show that the stability is @xmath47 with probability close to one in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", we utilize an argument for the stability of an event from section  2.6 of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the following inequality is proved in the bond percolation setting , but is easily adapted to site percolation , as discussed in section  5 of ref .",
    "we first write @xmath48 with some spatial overhead @xmath49",
    ". then the existence of @xmath46 vertex - disjoint crossings is still expected with probability close to one given by @xmath50 as long as the reduced exponent @xmath51 is positive and @xmath52 .",
    "namely , for a given @xmath3 in the supercritical phase , we can almost surely expect @xmath40 is @xmath39 with a spatial overhead depending only on @xmath3 , since @xmath53 can be chosen optimally over the range of @xmath54 .      in this section",
    "we show that each step in the algorithm runs in time at most @xmath4 .",
    "first , rhwf runs @xmath24 times to find @xmath24 paths .",
    "each time it finds a path , it will visit any given vertex at most @xmath38 times , since this is the maximum degree of a vertex .",
    "furthermore , each time rhwf is called , it can only visit vertices that are distinct from those visited by any previous call .",
    "since the most number of vertices possible is @xmath6 , all of the rhwf calls will visit no more than @xmath55 vertices , which is @xmath4 .",
    "the bridge and alternating bridge decompositions again visit at most @xmath4 vertices , this time only once , since there is no backtracking .",
    "reconfiguring the regions near the abutments requires only @xmath4 steps as well , since it only checks the degrees of the bridge start and end points .",
    "thus , the entire classical part of the algorithm has run time @xmath4 .",
    "the quantum part only requires @xmath4 measurements , so the @xmath4 scaling holds for the entire algorithm ."
