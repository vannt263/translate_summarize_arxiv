    "<S> a claim for evidence of dark matter interactions in the dama experiment has been recently reinforced . </S>",

    "<S> the first dama / libra dataset has confirmed the evidence for an annual modulation in the few kev portion of the spectrum @xcite , an effect previously observed in dama . the observed modulation has all the characteristics ( amplitude , phase , period ) expected @xcite from the motion of an earth - bound laboratory through a standard isothermal halo composed of wimps . </S>",
    "<S> the statistical significance of the modulation has reached 8.2 sigma . </S>",
    "<S> no other explanation has been found yet , prompting the dama collaboration to claim the effect is due to dark matter interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> competing dark matter searches have been able to exclude most of the phase space ( nuclear scattering cross section vs. wimp mass ) available as an explanation for this time - modulated signal . </S>",
    "<S> however , as a result of insufficiently - low energy thresholds in those detectors , it has been proposed @xcite that light wimps of less than @xmath0gev / c@xmath1 could cause the observed modulation while avoiding existing experimental constraints . </S>",
    "<S> this hypothesis has been recently ruled out by coupp @xcite , for those cases where wimp - nucleus scattering is mediated by a spin - dependent coupling @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> while the results obtained already impose constraints on the possible dark matter origins of the dama anomaly , it is expected that ongoing cryostat improvements , a longer exposure ( 8.4 kg - days here ) and operation in a deeper laboratory should dramatically improve the dark matter sensitivity of the device . </S>",

    "<S> of these , axion - like dark pseudoscalars are arguably comparable to wimps in their naturalness , being the subject of many dedicated searches . </S>",
    "<S> it has been claimed @xcite that such a pseudoscalar , coupling to electrons via the axio - electric effect , might be responsible for the observed modulation . </S>",
    "<S> following the prescriptions in @xcite and the proportionality between axio - electric and photo - electric couplings described in @xcite , it would be possible to arrive at a compact expression for the axio - electric interaction rate from pseudoscalars forming a standard dark halo with the properties listed above , acting on a target of mass number @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the cross section in @xcite tacitly assumes relativistic particle speeds , not the case here . the correct expression for the relevant interaction rate </S>",
    "<S> is derived in @xcite : @xmath24 [ kg@xmath25d@xmath25 ] = @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the dimensionless strength of the coupling , @xmath22 is the pseudoscalar rest mass in kev and @xmath29 is the photo - electric cross section in barns / atom . </S>",
    "<S> these rates are shown for both nai and ge in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . due to the non - relativistic nature of galaxy - bound dark matter , the spectral observable from such interactions would be a peak at an energy corresponding to @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> dama actually observes the bulk of the modulation being centered around such a peak at @xmath33 kev @xcite , albeit hindered by another one from a known source of radioactive contamination ( @xmath30k ) . </S>",

    "<S> limits on the maximum amplitude of a gaussian peak of width defined by the energy resolution of the detector , buried anywhere in the 0.3 - 8 kev ppc spectral region . </S>",

    "<S> these constraints are displayed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 together with the values of @xmath28 and @xmath22 claimed to be compatible with the dama effect in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while the cosmological relevance of pseudoscalar , scalar and vector dark matter in the kev mass region is emphasized in @xcite , it is also shown there that the dama modulation is too large to be caused by these possibilities . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore caution the reader about the relevance of the dama region in fig . 3 and of the conclusions in @xcite . more specifically , adopting the rates and reasoning in @xcite , a pseudoscalar origin for the modulation can not be justified , but dama should still have a competitive sensitivity to such candidates .     </S>",

    "<S> it is natural to wonder about the possible reach of ppcs as dark matter detectors , and specifically about particle phenomenologies where all other existing detector designs would be unable to contribute to the exploration , due to their higher thresholds .    </S>",

    "<S> ppc detectors are ideally suited for confirming or definitively disproving dama s claim of dark matter discovery . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , technologies able to explore the many possible phenomenological faces of the dark matter problem should be encouraged and developed . </S>",
