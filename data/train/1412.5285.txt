    "then one says a qpt occurs , with @xmath11 the qpt point .",
    "recently , concepts from quantum information theory , such as quantum entanglement , have been used to characterize qpts.@xcite the entanglement entropy , which describes the quantum entanglement between a subchain with its environment , has been studied in many one - dimensional quantum spin chains , and an interesting scaling behavior has been observed.@xcite for instance , in a spin xy model , as the increase of the subchain , entanglement entropy shows a logarithmic growth in the vicinity of the qpt point meanwhile achieves a finite saturation value in non - qpt regions.@xcite the scaling behavior is found to be related to the long - range ( short - range ) correlations of the system at ( off ) the qpt point .",
    "these studies have deepened our understanding of qpts .    with the help of bell - type inequalities ,",
    "quantum entanglement has been generalized into multi - partite settings,@xcite where a concept  the hierarchy of correlations emerges naturally in many - body systems .",
    "it has been found that the xy model shows high ( low ) hierarchy of multipartite correlation at ( off ) the second - order qpt point.@xcite furthermore , we have studied the multipartite correlation in the xxz model , and observed low hierarchy of multipartite correlation at the infinite - order qpt point of the chain.@xcite the result is unexpected , since a system usually shows maximum mount of quantum correlation at the qpts .",
    "a possible reason is that , the qpt in the xxz model is driven by other type of quantum correlation , rather than the entanglement .",
    "an alternative of entanglement is quantum discord ( qd ) , since qd can be used to capture all the quantumness of correlation in a quantum two - qubit state , with entanglement included.@xcite qd has been investigated extensively in many quantum models , such as one - dimensional quantum spin chains and matrix product systems.@xcite recently , the concept of qd has been generalized into multi - site settings , which is called global quantum discord ( gqd).@xcite    the behavior of gqd in finite - size spin chains have been studied in several papers , and the relation between gqd and qpts has been discussed.@xcite for instance , gqd show a maximum in the vicinity of the qpt point of the transverse - field ising model.@xcite we need to mention that , in all the models studied ( including the transverse field ising model , the cluster - ising model , the spin xx model and the ashkin - teller model ) , ( i ) the length of the finite - size chain is very short , i.e. , @xmath12 , and ( ii ) gqd does not show any clue of convergence as the increase of @xmath13 .",
    "thus , an effective method to characterize gqd in infinite - size spin chain is still unknown .",
    "since qpt is a macroscopic phenomena occurring in infinite - size systems rather than finite - size systems , the study of gqd in infinite chains would be valuable .    in this paper , we will study gqd in infinite - size spin chains . in the framework of matrix product states ( mpss),@xcite we propose an effective procedure to calculate gqd ( denoted as @xmath0 ) for consecutive @xmath1-site subchains in one - dimensional infinite - size spin chains .",
    "since the ground states of one - dimensional translational - invariant chains can always be approximately expressed as mpss through the infinite time - evolving block decimation ( itebd ) algorithm , our procedure can be widely adopted in quantum spin chains.@xcite we use the method to study @xmath3 for an infinite three - body interaction model with @xmath1 up to @xmath4 and an infinite xxz model with @xmath1 up to @xmath5 . in both models , for any given physical parameter , as the increase of @xmath1 , @xmath3 shows an interesting linear growth , that is , @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , in non - critical regions @xmath7 converges very fast , while in critical regions it converges relatively slow .",
    "the behaviors are explained in a clear physical picture with the short - range and long - range correlations .",
    "then we successfully apply our theory to an exactly soluble infinite - size spin xy chain , which can reduce to the transverse - field ising model and the xx model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec ,",
    "ii , we briefly review the concept of gqd .",

    "one can see that the speed of convergence of @xmath161 and @xmath8 is physically determined by long - range or short - range correlations in low - dimensional quantum spin systems .",
    "in order to further confirm the conclusions in the previous sections , which are drawn from approximate numerical results , we will study the global discord in an exactly soluble one - dimensional infinite quantum spin xy chain .",

    "the system reduces to the transverse - field ising model and the xx model for @xmath184 and @xmath185 , respectively .",

    "the infinite spin xy chain is exactly soluble by introducing majorana operators and using wick s theorem from quantum - field theory .",
    "we were able to figure out the reduced density matrix @xmath30 for a subchain consisting of @xmath1 consecutive spins with @xmath188 .",
    "more details of calculations can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . after obtaining @xmath30",
    ", we use formula ( [ eq : camp_gqd ] ) to calculate the discord .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : xy ] ( a ) and ( b ) , we show the results of global discord for @xmath184 ( the ising model ) and @xmath185 ( the xx model ) , respectively . for @xmath184",
    ", one can see that @xmath0 will always show a peak in the vicinity of the second - order qpt point @xmath189 . for @xmath185 ,",
    "@xmath0 is zero for @xmath190 and its first - order derivative is divergent at the infinite - order qpt point @xmath189 .",
    "thus global discord of subchains in the infinite chain can be very convenient to characterize the qpts in the xy chains .",
    "we would like to mention that the global discord of finite - size xx chains with up to 11 sites has been studied in ref .",
    "one can see that @xmath0 in infinite chains , even just with @xmath191 , shows more clear and sharp signal of the infinite - order qpt than in finite - size chains with up to 11 sites .",
    "it is obvious that as the increase of @xmath1 , the global discord @xmath0 never converges in fig .",
    "[ fig : xy](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "thus we show @xmath8 for @xmath184 and @xmath185 in fig .",
    "[ fig : xy](c ) and ( d ) , respectively .",
    "one can find a clear clue of convergence .",
    "especially , in the gapped regions @xmath192 of the transverse - field ising model , @xmath8 converges very fast(see fig .",
    "[ fig : xy](c ) ) . on the other hand , in the vicinity of the gapless region @xmath193 of the transverse - field ising model ( fig .",

    "[ fig : ising_k ] we show the convergence of @xmath151 for the transverse - field ising model .",
    "one can see that @xmath7 converges more slowly in the vicinity of the qpt point @xmath189 than in non - critical regions .",

    "i. secondly , @xmath0 shows an approximately linear behavior as the increase of @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath195 , and its slope @xmath7 would converge when @xmath1 is large enough . since @xmath120 in the limit @xmath119",

    "@xmath8 ( and @xmath7 ) has twofold physical meanings .",
    "it can be regarded as `` global discord per site '' , very similar to `` energy per site '' in quantum spin systems .",

    "the convergent value of @xmath7 ( and @xmath8 ) describes the quantum correlation between a single site and an infinite chain .",
    "furthermore , we find @xmath8 ( and @xmath7 ) converges faster in the gapped ( non - critical ) regions than in the gapless ( critical ) regions .",
    "the speed of convergence is determined by the short - range correlations and long - range correlations in the two situations .",
    "the relation between quantum correlation and qpts is an interesting topic recently .",
    "as illustrated in the figures of this paper , the global discord shows clear signal for the qpts .",
    "we would like to pay our attention to the infinite - order qpt in the xxz model(fig .",

    ", it has been reported that the measure of multi - partite entanglement shows a size - independent minima at @xmath196 , which indicates low hierarchy of multi - partite entanglement in the qpt .",
    "these two completely opposite results suggest that the qpt in the xxz model is driven by some non - trivial type of quantum correlation , i.e. , it is highly correlated meanwhile low - hierarchically entangled .",
