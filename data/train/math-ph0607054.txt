    "there are many physically interesting examples of quantum resonances in atomic physics and quantum optics . to mention one , the state of a cold gas of atoms localized in a trap may be metastable , since the trap may be not strictly confining . in typical bose - einstein condensation experiments ,",
    "the shape of the trap usually varies slowly over time scales small compared to the lifetime of the metastable state , yet larger than a typical relaxation time ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "this is an example of an adiabatic evolution of shape resonances .",
    "while there has been much progress in a time - independent theory of quantum resonances ( see @xcite ) , there has been relatively little work on a time - dependent theory of quantum resonances ( see @xcite ) .",
    "surprisingly , and inspite of its relevance to the interpretation of many experiments and phenomena in atomic physics , the problem of adiabatic evolution of quantum resonances received very litte attention , so far ; ( but see @xcite ) .    in this paper , we study the adiabatic evolution of three general types of quantum resonances .",
    "this is a first step towards a rigorous understanding of resonance- and metastability phenomena , such as hysteresis in magnets and sisyphus cooling of atomic gases ; ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "we first consider the adiabatic evolution of so called shape resonances .",
    "more specifically , we consider a quantum - mechanical particle in a potential well , say that of a quantum dot or a locally harmonic trap , with the property that the shape of the potential well changes over time scales which are small compared to the time needed for the particle to escape from the well .",
    "the analysis of this problem is based on a precise form of the time - energy uncertainty relation , see @xcite , and the standard adiabatic theorem in quantum mechanics , @xcite . in our approach ,",
    "we obtain an explicit estimate on the distance between the true state of the system and an _ instantaneous _ metastable state .",
    "our approach can also be applied to study the time evolution of the state of an electron in a @xmath0 ion moving in a time - dependent magnetic field which changes over time scales that are small compared to the ionization time of the ion ; ( see @xcite for a discussion of this example in the time - independent situation ) .    the second class of examples concerns quantum resonances that appear as isolated complex eigenvalues of spectrally deformed hamiltonians , such as the n - body stark effect ;",
    "( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "our analysis is based on balslev - combes theory for dilatation analytic hamiltonians , @xcite , and on an adiabatic theorem for generators of evolution that are not necessarily normal or bounded , @xcite .",
    "this approach , too , yields explicit estimates on the distance between the true state of the system and an instantaneous metastable state .    the third class of examples concerns resonances that emerge from eigenvalues of an unperturbed hamiltonian embedded in the continuous spectrum after a perturbation has been added to the hamiltonian .",
    "typical examples of such resonances arise when a small quantum - mechanical system , say an impurity spin , is coupled to an infinite , dispersive medium , such as magnons ( see for example @xcite for relevant physical models ) .",
    "our approach to such examples is based on an extension of adiabatic theorems _ without a spectral gap condition _ , @xcite .",
    "our results also cover the case of resonance crossings .",
