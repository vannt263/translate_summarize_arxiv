    "off - diagonal matrix elements of the orbital angular momentum enter into important physical quantities , such as magnetic dipole absorption and van vleck susceptibility .",
    "this is particularly significant in the situations when the angular momentum is not a good quantum number .",
    "such is the case in disordered systems where , in the semiclassical approximation , it was shown that in 2d @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the wave number of a free particle whose energy @xmath12 corresponds to level @xmath2 , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are , respectively , the mean - free - path and the scattering time due to disorder .",
    "this result can be derived either by considering the classical magneto - dipole absorption@xcite,@xcite or by a direct evaluation@xcite using the technique developed in refs.@xcite,@xcite .",
    "disordered systems are classically chaotic . in the semiclassical regime they exhibit ",
    "level rigidity ,  which prevents large fluctuations in the level spacings and , in turn , large fluctuations of the number of levels in an energy interval.@xcite-@xcite classically integrable systems , on the other hand , exhibit  level bunching  characterized by large fluctuations in level spacings and high occurrence of small spacings - hence the term -  and , in turn , large fluctuations in the number of levels in an energy interval.@xcite,@xcite ( it was recently shown that such behavior extends only up to a certain energy scale , upon which strong correlations between levels set in@xcite ; even then , the number level variance exhibit large , non - decaying oscillations around the  saturation value .",
    " ) consequently , the mesoscopic , or non self - averaging , effects are expected to be more pronounced in integrable systems .",
    "the fluctuations in the level spacings ( and more generally , the specifics of correlations between the levels ) is , however , just one of the factors contributing to the mesoscopic fluctuations of physical quantities .",
    "other contributors are expected to fluctuate much stronger in classically integrable systems than in classically chaotic systems as well . in the first part of this paper we consider the fluctuations of the off - diagonal matrix elements of the angular momentum in a rectangular box .",
    "we will show , in particular , that @xmath15 where @xmath3 is the level number of @xmath2 and @xmath16 is a rectangle s side .",
    "brackets in eq .",
    "( [ lif_dirt ] ) denote averaging over various realizations of disorder , which is an example of  ensemble averaging .",
    " a natural extension of the concept of ensemble averaging to a rectangular box would be to average over the aspect ratios of the rectangles sides . however , our analytical derivation of eq .",
    "( [ lif_rect ] ) is based on  spectral averaging ,  that is averaging over an energy interval .",
    "a detailed explanation of our numerical procedure will be given in text , but it should be already mentioned that a _ combined _ ensemble and spectral averaging was performed . the former involves averaging over the aspect ratios chosen to be algebraic and close to @xmath17 the latter is over an energy interval that includes a large number of pairs @xmath18 and is , in fact , necessary due to large fluctuations in @xmath19 .",
    "in other words , spectral averaging proves essential both in order to derive a closed form analytical expression and to ensure convergence of numerical results .",
    "clearly , an underlying assumption is the validity of the  ergodic hypothesis  - that the two averages are equivalent .",
    "this section is organized as follows .",
    "first , we show that the magnitude of @xmath20 is determined by the hierarchy of ( odd ) pairs @xmath21and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the nearest energy levels . for a given pair , @xmath25 with the largest coefficient , by two orders of magnitude , corresponding to @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , we show that the probability of the latter @xmath26 , while for most pairs it is @xmath27 . consequently , such pairs give an overwhelming contribution to the spectral average , which results in eq .",
    "( [ lif_rect ] ) .",
    "this is subsequently verified numerically .      for a rectangle ,",
    "the energy eigenvalues are @xmath28 we consider rectangles of the same area @xmath29 in an ensemble with different values of the ratio @xmath30 .",
    "numerically , we use algebraic numbers for @xmath31 to reduce accidental level degeneracies . expressing the energies in terms of the mean level spacing ,",
    "@xmath32 we find the dimensionless form of the spectrum @xmath33 for @xmath34 , we have a simplified expression for the spectrum @xmath35 which will be used in the analytical derivation below@xcite ( in our numerical work , we also use algebraic @xmath31 s close to @xmath36 ) .",
    "for an energy @xmath37 , where the relevant quantities can be described semiclassically , the level @xmath2 nearest to ( and below ) @xmath38 will be characterized , in general , by a different pair @xmath39 for each @xmath31 . on the average ,",
    "the level number @xmath40 of level @xmath23 is @xmath41 in what follows , the variations in @xmath40 with @xmath31 are not important .",
    "consequently , we drop @xmath42 and identify @xmath40 with @xmath38 .",
    "the matrix element of the orbital angular momentum between the levels @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( @xmath43 for definiteness ) is given by @xmath44   \\label{lif}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 and @xmath22 are odd .",

    "1 shows @xmath54 as a functions of @xmath40 for a single aspect ratio @xmath55 .",
    "the top straight line corresponds to @xmath56 , @xmath57 the other two lines correspond , respectively , to @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath56 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 permutations .",
    "the slopes of other lines are too small for them to be visible in this plot .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ enn_reduced-1 ] ) and ( [ n_calligr ] ) , we have @xmath62 combining this with ( [ epsi_epsf-2 ] ) and substituting into eq .",
    "( [ lif_simpl-2 ] ) , we find @xmath63 for the three lines shown in fig .",
    "as seen from the figure , these straight lines are in excellent agreement with the numerical results .",
    "we emphasize that fig .",
    "1 should be understood as follows : as @xmath2 moves up , from one level to the next , @xmath19  jumps  - up or down - between the points on straight lines ( whose total number is of order @xmath40 , with only three shown here ) , indicating orders of magnitude fluctuations as a function of the position in the spectrum .",
    "it follows from ( [ enn_reduced ] ) that the greater the range of @xmath31 , the greater is the spectral @xmath64 asymmetry and the higher in spectrum it is necessary to move to eliminate it vs. changes of @xmath65 lead to disparate changes of energy for rectangles whose sides are substantially different .",
    "however , this anisotropy is eliminated for an algebraic aspect ratio once above a sufficiently high energy in the spectrum . ] . on the other hand , keeping @xmath31 s close to a fixed value introduces a problem of sampling , which , again , requires higher energies to be considered numerically.s are very close to each other . ]",
    "thus , there exists an inherent technical difficulty with ensemble averaging in a box . as a practical matter",
    ", we take up to @xmath66 values of @xmath67 $ ] for the energy range @xmath68 .",
    "this choice of parameters proved suitable for ensemble averaging in a numerical part of the study of statistical properties of the energy spectrum itself.@xcite however , ensemble averaging with these parameters does not lead to the numerical convergence of @xmath8 .",
    "a portent of this can be already glimpsed from the orders of magnitude fluctuations in @xmath19 discussed in the preceding subsection . moreover , if @xmath40 is fixed instead but different aspect ratios are considered , the fluctuations of @xmath69 are as large as a function of @xmath31 as they are as a function of @xmath40 .",
    "consequently , together with @xmath31-averaging , an additional spectral averaging over the energy interval @xmath70 $ ] , @xmath71 , is performed to achieve numerical convergence .",
    "the interval width is taken to be @xmath72 , which , for the above parameters , increases the sampling range by several orders of magnitude .",
    "interestingly , it also turns out that spectral averaging is amenable to an analytical derivation , which we proceed to outline here .    the key idea in this derivation",
    "is that the average of @xmath69 is dominated by the contribution from the top line in fig .",
    "numerically , it is clearly seen from fig.2 where the higher set of points corresponds to averaging over all pairs @xmath18 ( all lines in fig .",
    "1 ) , while the lower set corresponds to averaging only over the top line in fig . 1(@xmath58 , @xmath57 ) .",
    "the fitting lines for the two sets are given , respectively , by @xmath73 and @xmath74 which are remarkably close .",
    "note that we used a combined average over @xmath66 values of @xmath67 $ ] and over energy window @xmath75 .",
    "great sensitivity to the spectral averaging is obvious from fig .",
    "3 where the interval was reduced to @xmath76 .",
    "physical interpretation of these results is as follows . as has been mentioned in the preceding subsection , at a spectral point @xmath40",
    "there are @xmath77 lines whose slopes can be determined ( for small @xmath78 ) via a procedure that resulted in eq .",
    "( [ lif_straight ] ) . for a given @xmath31 , as @xmath2 moves upward from level to level ( that is , as @xmath40 is increased ) , @xmath54  jumps  between these straight lines . in principle , a  jump  can be from any one of these lines to any other .",
    "however , in determining the average , one must remember that not only the slope decreases rapidly from the top line down , but the probability of being on a line also decreases rapidly from @xmath79 on the top line to @xmath80 over the course of @xmath81 lines@xmath82 given this , and in view of the numerical evidence above , we approximate @xmath83 by the contribution from the top line in fig . 1 alone . from ( [ lif_straight ] ) , we find @xmath84 here @xmath85 and @xmath86 are , respectively , the probability that the nearest energy level pair satisfies the condition @xmath87and a conditional probability that @xmath57 , given that @xmath56 . in",
    "what follows , these are evaluated in a series of consecutive steps .",
    "first , we derive the probability distribution function @xmath88 .",
    "consider the energy interval defined , in accordance with ( [ enn_reduced-1 ] ) , by the numbers @xmath89 .",
    "a narrow interval is defined as such that @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the center of the interval and @xmath92 is its width : @xmath93 all pair points @xmath39 in this interval are located between the two quarter - circles shown in fig . 4 ,",
    "@xmath94 we propose a simple ansatz whereby @xmath95 is just the number of states in the interval @xmath96 , as illustrated by the shaded areas , which gives @xmath97 fig .",
    "5 shows this formula vis - a - vis the numerical evaluation for the same @xmath98 as in fig . 1 and for @xmath99 . clearly , the two are in excellent agreement .",
    "next , we evaluate the distribution function @xmath100 by convoluting @xmath101 and @xmath102 under the assumption of no correlations between @xmath103 and @xmath104 : @xmath105 the resulting formula is very complicated and in fig . 6 we will only show its plot vis - a - vis numerical evaluation for @xmath106 for a single @xmath31 and for an ensemble average over @xmath107 algebraic @xmath108 $ ] .",
    "clearly the agreement between the two is very good .",
    "notice that the dip at zero in the numerical distribution function is due to the fact that the probability of @xmath109 is suppressed for the nearest levels ( see , for instance eq .",
    "( [ epsi_epsf-2 ] ) showing that @xmath110 and @xmath22 should be finite and of opposite signs ) .",
    "notice also that we treat @xmath45 as a continuous variable and so a deviation from the numerical results should be anticipated for small discrete values of this variable .    as is clear from ( [ lif_av_top-2 ] ) , we only need the probability @xmath111 for our purposes .",
    "however , for the reasons just mentioned , we can not precisely determine it from the distribution obtained via ( [ p_kxnx ] ) and shown in fig . 6 by solid line .",
    "consequently , we use an ansatz where this probability is approximated by the area of width@xmath112 near the maximum of the distribution , that is @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the elliptic functions . expanding this expression for small @xmath117 ,",
    "while simultaneously replacing @xmath118 by @xmath91 , we find @xmath119 fig .",

    "the latter eliminates the main @xmath81 dependence and shows that the remainder is a slow - growing function of @xmath123 .",
    "unfortunately , due to indeterminacy inherently present in our ansatz , it is incapable of exactly describing this function .    to evaluate the conditional probability @xmath124",

    "8 vis - a - vis the numerical results .    before discussing analytical vs. numerical results ,",
    "we wish to pause briefly on the slight difference between @xmath129 and @xmath132 , as seen in fig .",
    "it follows from a more careful examination of eq .",
    "( [ epsi_epsf ] ) .",
    "indeed , it should be written as @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the separation between the levels .",

    "8 where the conditional probability @xmath129 does not have a value at @xmath136 while @xmath138 does .",
    "we now turn to a closer analysis of fig .",
    "obviously , the numerical distribution is much broader than the analytical distribution .",
    "the reason for that is that the former was obtained using a large number of @xmath31 -values whereas the latter was obtained in the approximation where @xmath31 was set to @xmath139 and hence ( [ enn_reduced-1 ] ) .",
    "clearly , even if the @xmath98-values are sufficiently close to @xmath36 , as in our simulations , different ensembles are nonetheless sampled for different @xmath31 s ( for sufficiently high energies , as has been previously mentioned ) using the exact formula ( [ enn_reduced ] ) . as a result",

    "the key results of this section are summarized in figs . 1 and 2 and eqs . ( [ lif_h ] ) and ( [ lif_l ] ) :    * given the energy ( the level number ) @xmath148",

    "@xmath19 experiences orders of magnitude fluctuation both as a function of @xmath31 and as a function of energy .",
    "* for numerical convergence it was necessary to perform a combined ensemble averaging ( over @xmath31 ) and energy averaging ( over energy interval @xmath150 ) .",
    "the result is given by eq .",
    "( [ lif_h ] ) and its magnitude almost entirely derives from the contribution of the top straight line in fig . 1 , @xmath151 , as seen by comparison with ( [ lif_l ] ) . the probability to find @xmath19 on the top line is @xmath152 , which explains why @xmath153 .",
    "it is central to our derivation that the conditional probability @xmath154 only weakly depends on @xmath40 , @xmath155 .",
    "it was recently proposed that , at zero temperature the orbital magnetic susceptibility , of free electrons in disordered systems can be explained by the two level van vleck response that involves the last occupied ( fermi ) level and the first unoccupied level@xcite,@xcite . whereas for an occasional fermi level in a given realization of disorder , or for an occasional realization of disorder given a fermi level close to a fixed energy value , the response can be diamagnetic , in the vast majority of cases it is paramagnetic .",
    "this prediction was recently verified numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite , which also confirmed that both the mean susceptibility and the susceptibility distribution function ( mesoscopic fluctuations ) can be quite accurately described by the two level model@xcite,@xcite .",
    "orbital susceptibility of rectangles has been previously studied both analytically and numerically @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , analytically the approach that generally works only at sufficiently high temperature was used and numerically only the rational aspect ratios of rectangles were examined ( e.g. squares ) .",
    "conversely , here we are concerned with a strictly @xmath156 response for the irrational ( algebraic in this numerical evaluation ) aspect ratios .",
    "our main conclusion is that , in complete analogy with the disordered systems , both the average and the fluctuations are successfully described by the two level van vleck response that involves the fermi level and the first unoccupied level .",
    "furthermore , the largest contribution to the response comes from the values @xmath19 from the top straight line in fig .",
    "1 , as explained in the preceding section , while the largest fluctuation occur when , for the points on that line , the energy difference @xmath157 between the nearest levels is particularly small .",
    "it will be observed that the orbital susceptibility exhibits a striking absence of self - averaging . while in part it is due to the fact that we evaluate the zero - field response at zero temperature , the underlying physics underscores , nonetheless , that mesoscopic effects are much more pronounced in classically integrable than in classically chaotic systems .      using the dimensionless notations , where the energy is measured in units of @xmath158 and the susceptibility in units of @xmath159",
    ", we find the total orbital susceptibility as follows : @xmath160 where @xmath161 , @xmath0 , is the unperturbed ( zero - field ) spectrum ( [ enn_reduced ] ) .",
    "while the landau gauge was used in this expression , the final result is gauge - independent ( for a discussion , see ref.@xcite ) .",

    "10 shows the result of numerical evaluation of @xmath163 plotted as a function of @xmath40 , vis - a - vis @xmath164 , where @xmath161 and @xmath165 are now limited to the fermi level and the first unoccupied level , @xmath166 @xmath167 .",
    "this is motivated by the surmise that the contributions of the two sums in eq .",
    "( [ khi_tot ] ) - diamagnetic and paramagnetic - largely cancel each other over the fermi sea and the total susceptibility , on average , can be explained by a single term in the van vleck sum , namely , the one between the last occupied and the first unoccupied levels .",
    "( the analogous surmise in disordered systems@xcite,@xcite had been already verified numerically@xcite . )",
    "the subset of the latter , @xmath168 , with the contributions only from the top line in fig . 1 is also shown .",
    "while the difference in the distribution function of @xmath169 on the top line relative to the poissonian should be noted ( and will be discussed in a separate publication ) , the dominance of the @xmath170 contribution to @xmath171 suggests that the top line should dominate the contribution from the @xmath166 @xmath167 term also .",

    "( to further emphasize the predominance of large fluctuations , in fig .",
    "11 we show the same @xmath178 as in fig . 10 vis - a - vis @xmath178 that was obtained for the same @xmath31-ensemble but whose energy averaging was performed over intervals @xmath179 times narrower . ) on the other hand , our surmise that the two level van vleck paramagnetism accurately describes the average orbital response is evident from fig .",
    "10 as the structure of @xmath163 vs. @xmath40 is well reproduced by the nearest level contributions alone ; the difference between the two are the contributions from the terms in the double - sum of ( [ khi_tot ] ) that are due to the levels further below and above the fermi level .",
    "the large value of @xmath180 in ( [ invspacing_ave ] ) is readily understood from the exponential ( poissonian ) distribution function of the level spacings@xcite,@xcite , @xmath181 $ ] , whereof @xmath182 where @xmath183 is a cut - off .",
    "since we evaluate the zero field response at zero temperature , the cut - off is the smallest spacing observed for the values of @xmath31 and energies considered here , which happens to be @xmath184 ( the mean level spacing being @xmath36 ) . as already mentioned , the distribution function of the level spacings on the top line of fig .",
    "1 will be discussed elsewhere , however , it turns out that @xmath185 is also formally divergent and , for the parameters used here , numerical evaluation gives @xmath186 .",
    "it should be pointed out however that in reality , even at zero temperature , the magnetic field itself introduces a natural cut - off ; for disordered systems this was discussed in ref.@xcite .",

    "it demonstrates that the mean zero - temperature , zero - field orbital magnetic susceptibility of a free electron gas in a rectangular box can be explained in terms of a two - level van vleck response - that of the last occupied ( fermi )  and the first unoccupied levels .",
    "furthermore , it is dominated by the contributions from the top line in fig .",
    "1 , namely @xmath170 , which is also the largest contributor to @xmath83 discussed in the preceding section .",
    "in fact , the mean value of susceptibility is reasonably well described by @xmath267 where @xmath268 is large due to the absence of correlations for small level separations .",
    "it is also evident that the orbital susceptibility is largely a non self - averaging quantity , as seen from figs .",
    "10 and 11 .",
    "this is due to the existence of huge variations in inverse level spacings , which , in turn , allow for such large contributions that may singularly outweigh the totality of more typical contributions in the average response .",
    "such variations were explained in terms of a decomposition of algebraic aspect ratios into rational numbers , whose interplay in ( [ beta_truncated ] ) is crucial for understanding the peaks of @xmath187 . it must be borne in mind , however , that this feature of the orbital susceptibility is very fragile with respect to perturbations and that mesoscopic fluctuations will be suppressed at finite temperatures ( or even by finite values of the magnetic field ) ; we intend to address this problem elsewhere .",
    "the most striking feature revealed here is the non - self - averaging property of physical quantities in a rectangular box , which represents a class of integrable billiard problems .",
    "we had previously discussed@xcite the persisting long - range correlations in the semiclassical energy spectrum of this system .",
    "these correlations are more complex than those in classically chaotic ( disordered ) systems@xcite-@xcite . in particular , we discussed the large , non - decaying oscillations of the level number variance on an energy interval as a function of the interval width .",
    "similarly , we find that mesoscopic fluctuations here are much more pronounced than in classically chaotic systems .",
    "for instance , while eqs .",
    "( [ lif_dirt ] ) and ( [ lif_rect ] ) point to the same order of magnitude in a ballistic disordered system , @xmath269 , and a rectangular billiard , the latter will have much larger fluctuations ( we have discussed the difficulties with averaging in text ) .    the one similarity that stands out for both integrable and chaotic systems is that both the average orbital susceptibility of the free electron gas and its fluctuations can be well described by a two level van vleck response that couples the last occupied ( fermi ) and the first unoccupied levels . for disordered systems ,",
    "this has been demonstrated previously in refs.@xcite,@xcite , and@xcite and for an integrable case in this work .",
    "the difference , however , is that in disordered systems the non - self - averaging effects are less pronounced : in the absence of cut - offs ( temperature , finite magnetic field , etc . ) , the average is well defined and only the higher cumulants are divergent . in a rectangular box , even the average is already ill - defined , as pointed out in discussion of eq .",
    "( [ diverg ] ) .",
    "our next step will be to investigate the effect of temperature on the orbital magnetism of integrable systems . towards this end",
    ", we will apply imry s formalism , which allows to express the average response in terms of the level correlation function.@xcite for rectangles , the latter is now well understood , including as function of magnetic field.@xcite this formalism works well at sufficiently high temperature and should provide an insight into the scales at which the transition to the zero - temperature limit , discussed here , occurs ( as was done for disordered systems@xcite ) .",
