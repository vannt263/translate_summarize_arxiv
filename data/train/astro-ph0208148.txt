    "ss 433 remains one of the most enigmatic objects in the sky .",
    "even twenty - five years after its first appearance in the catalogue of stephanson & sanduleak ( 1977 ) , it is not clear whether the compact object is a black hole or a neutron star .",
    "however , there is ample evidence that the companion is an ob type star with an orbital period of 13.1 days , which is losing mass at the rate of about @xmath0 ( van den heuvel 1981 ) , corresponding to extremely super - eddington accretion regardless of the mass of the compact object .",
    "one of the most curious properties of the jets of ss 433 , which first made their presence distinctly felt through the emission of variable h@xmath1 lines , is that they are apparently ejected as bullets ( e.g.  borisov & fabrika 1987 ;  vermeulen et al .",
    "1993 ; paragi et al .  1999 ; 2002 ; gies et al .",
    "2002 ) , with a surprisingly nearly constant radial velocity of about @xmath2 .",
    "the absence of a significant intrinsic rotational velocity ( i.e. , @xmath3 ) component is clear from the fact that the kinematic model ( e.g.  abell and margon 1979 ) , which assumes only radial injection , quite accurately explains the time variation of the red- and blue - shifts of the h@xmath1 emission from the jets with a period of 162 days , which is attributed to the precession of the accretion disk about the compact object . the radial velocity is less than the maximum allowed sound speed of @xmath4 and thus hydrodynamic acceleration could , in principle , explain it",
    ". therefore one may not require a magnetic or electrodynamic acceleration processes ( e.g.  belcher & macgregor 1976 ; lovelace 1976 ) .",
    "however , the rather good collimation ( margon 1984 ; paragi et al .  1999 ) supports the hypothesis that a substantial degree of confinement produced by toroidal flux tubes may be present .",
    "gies et al .",
    "( 2002 ) showed that the ratios of the h@xmath1 emission equivalent widths from the approaching and receding jets as a function of precessional phase only could be nicely fit if these emission components are bullet - like .",
    "indeed , the recent chandra x - ray observatory discovery of x - rays at a distance of about @xmath5 cm from the center may result from the collision of such bullets ( migliari , fender , & mendez 2002 ) .",
    "ss 433 poses another interesting problem : it was pointed out by chakrabarti ( 1999 ) and das & chakrabarti ( 1999 ) that significant outflows are produced only when the accretion rate is such that the x - ray source is in a low / hard state , and all the observational indications in other micro - quasars also suggest that the jets are indeed produced in low / hard states ( corbel et al .",
    "2001 ; klein - wolt et al .",
    "however , it is difficult to imagine how ss 433 manages to remain in the low / hard state with @xmath6 of wind matter ejected from its companion .",
    "the answer to this quandary probably lies in the recent results of paragi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and blundell et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , whose high resolution radio maps show that there is a large region of roughly @xmath7 in radius which is filled with enough gas and dust to obscure the accretion disk and the base of the jets .",
    "they also found an equatorial outflow .",
    "gies et al .",
    "( 2002 ) present additional evidence from observations of the `` stationary '' h@xmath1 and he i lines for an extended `` disk wind '' .",
    "so it is distinctly possible that most of the matter from the donor is rejected either by centrifugal force ( chakrabarti 2002 ) or by radiation force far outside the central accretion disk , and thus the compact object receives only a few times the eddington rate ( @xmath8 ) of its companion s wind matter to accrete .",
    "this consideration finds further support from the fact that the kinematic luminosity of the jet itself is around @xmath9 erg s@xmath10 ( margon 1984 ) , which corresponds to about one eddington rate for a @xmath11 compact object .    in numerical simulations of supercritical winds by eggum , coroniti & katz ( 1985 ) designed to model",
    "ss 433 , it was shown that only a fraction of a percent of the infalling matter is ejected from a radiation pressure supported keplerian disk , which indicates that the accretion rate must be at least @xmath12 if the accretion takes place through a keplerian disk .",
    "on the other hand , numerical simulations of a sub - keplerian disk by molteni , lanzafame & chakrabarti ( 1994 ) suggest that about @xmath13 percent of matter is ejected as an outflow , indicating that the accretion rate onto the compact object in ss 433 need be at most a few @xmath8 .",
    "similar simulations with different parameters yield situations where no steady shocks can form , even though two saddle - type sonic points are present ( ryu , chakrabarti , & molteni 1997 , hereafter rcm ) ; under these conditions large scale shock oscillations produce intermittent outflows instead of continuous outflows .",
    "since the compact object is a wind accretor , a low - angular momentum , sub - keplerian flow is the most likely description of the accretion flow .",
    "indeed , the presence of sub - keplerian flows in several other high mass x - ray binaries has now been verified ( smith , heindl & swank 2002 ) .    in this _ letter _ , we present a few scenarios leading to ejection of matter as bullets in ss 433 .",
    "we discuss four possible ways to create blobs of matter emerging from the disk and conclude that periodic ejection of the blobs by the large scale oscillation of an accretion shock ( something like a piston ) may be the fundamental production mechanism of the `` normal '' bullets .",
    "the irregularly observed rapid flaring",
    "( vermeulen et al . 1993 ) could be understood in terms of the catastrophic collapse of toroidal magnetic flux tubes , very similar to what has been argued to be occurring in grs 1915 + 105 ( vadawale et al .",
    "2001 ; nandi et al .",
    "2001 ) . in the next section",
    "we discuss these processes and their suitability or unsuitability for ss 433 . in  3 , we present concluding remarks .",
    "in both the works of eggum et al .  ( 1985 ) and molteni et al .",
    "( 1994 ) continuous ejection was reported when a radiation pressure dominated keplerian disk , or a sub - keplerian disk capable of producing a steady shock , were considered . however , in ss 433 the basic ejection is bullet - like and since the size of the x - ray emitting region is smaller than @xmath14 cm within which the material in the jets is already accelerated to @xmath15 ( watson et al .",
    "1986 ; stewart et al .",
    "1987 ) , the bullets are not expected to be delayed by more than @xmath16s .",
    "indeed , recent rossi x - ray timing experiment ( rxte ) observations of hard x - rays from ss 433 indicated variability on time scales of 501000 s ( safi - harb & kotani 2002 ) , roughly corroborating this picture .",
    "in fact , a simultaneous measurement of a flare at @xmath17 ghz in the radio ( kotani & trushkin 2001 ) and in hard x - rays ( safi - harb & kotani 2002 ) indicated a strong anti - correlation of radio and x - ray fluxes , similar to what is observed in grs 1915 + 105 ( mirabel & rodriguez 1994 ) .",
    "moreover , the x - ray luminosity is very low ( @xmath18erg s@xmath10 ) and is believed to come from the base of the jets ( watson et al .",
    "it is believed to have a thermal origin and exosat ( watson et al .",
    "1986 ) and ginga ( yuan et al .",
    "1995 ) observations were adequately fitted with a thermal bremsstrahlung model with @xmath19 kev .",
    "the overall spectral shape suggests that the source has always been in a standard low / hard state and so far no quasi - thermal emission expected from a ` keplerian disk ' has been detected . from the interaction of the jet with the supernovae remnant w50 ,",
    "the lower limit of kinematic luminosity is found to be at least @xmath9erg s@xmath10 ( biretta et al .",
    "1983 ; davidson & mccray 1980 ) .",
    "this means that the mean mass outflow rate is around @xmath20 g s@xmath10 , and if most of it is in the form of bullets ejected at 501000 s intervals , the mass accumulated in each bullet should be in the range of @xmath21@xmath22 g .",
    "the above data implies that the essential features that one must explain when attempting to produce bullets out of the accretion disks are : ( a ) the disk should be a sub - keplerian flow ; ( b ) the object ( black hole or a neutron star ) and its surroundings should be in a low / hard state ; ( c ) bullets should be ejected in 501000 s time - scales under normal circumstances ; ( d ) the mass of each bullet should be around @xmath23 g ; and finally , ( e ) there should be occasional flaring with an anti - correlation of radio and x - ray emission .",
    "we now discuss several scenarios and present what we believe to be the most probable picture of what is going on in ss 433 .",
    "the four processes are schematically shown in fig .",
    "1(a - d ) .",
    "it was shown by several numerical simulations that significant outflows are produced from regions very close to the inner edge of the accretion flow , possibly from the centrifugal pressure dominated region ( molteni et al .",
    "1994 ; molteni et al .",
    "these jets are launched subsonically , but quickly pass through the inner sonic point to become supersonic . in the subsonic region while the matter moves slowly , the density is high and the optical depth could be large enough ( @xmath24 ) to undergo compton cooling ( fig .",
    "1a ) _ provided there is a keplerian disk underneath to supply soft photons_. a part of the outflow , which was subsonic previously becomes supersonic because of this rapid cooling and separates from the base of the jet .",
    "this separation of blobs is expected to occur at the sonic surface @xmath25 which is @xmath26 , where , @xmath27 is the size of the centrifugal barrier ; see chakrabarti ( 1999 ) .",
    "this possibility , though attractive , and in fact likely to be a major mechanism for rapid state change in objects like grs 1915 + 105 ( chakrabarti & manickam 2000 ) , is untenable in ss 433 because the latter is a wind accretor : thus no significant keplerian disk is expected in this system to supply the soft photons , and indeed none has been detected so far ( watson et al .",
    "1986 ; yuan et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "numerical simulations of accretion flow show that in cases where the cooling time - scale nearly matches the infall time - scale , a shock forms , but it then starts oscillating and ejects matter quasi - periodically ( langer , chanmugam & shaviv 1983 ; molteni , sponholz & chakrabarti 1996 , hereafter msc ; see fig .",
    "in order to have an oscillation period of around @xmath28s , the shock must be located at the large distance of @xmath29 for a black hole of mass @xmath30 , where @xmath31 .",
    "the mass of the post - shock region is computed by equating the bremsstrahlung ( which we assume to be the major cooling mechanism ) cooling time and the infall time in the post - shock region ( msc ) : @xmath32 where , @xmath33 is the specific thermal energy , @xmath34 is the infall velocity and @xmath35 ( these limits are for a strong shock with @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively ) is the compression ratio at the shock . assuming the gas density ( @xmath38 ) and temperature ( @xmath39 ) scale as @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively , the mass of the sub - keplerian region of @xmath42 turns out to be @xmath43 g ( with @xmath30 , @xmath36 ) .",
    "this is indeed of the same order as the mass of the bullets observed in ss 433 .",
    "however , one has to have both the angular momentum and energy of the injected material comparable to the marginally bound values determined by the central object in order to achieve such an oscillation .",
    "on the other hand , if the mass expulsion from the system takes place at the similar radius of @xmath44 cm due to the centrifugal force , the specific angular momentum of the flow is approximately @xmath45^{1/2}r_g c \\sim 70 r_g c$ ] , which is very large compared to the marginally bound value of @xmath46 .",
    "so it is unlikely that this mechanism works in ss 433 .",
    "a standing shock can form in a sub - keplerian flow only if there are two saddle type sonic points and the rankine ",
    "hugoniot relation is satisfied at least at one point in between these two sonic points .",
    "however , chakrabarti ( 1990 ) showed that there is a large region of the parameter space where there are two saddle type sonic points but the shock - conditions are not satisfied .",
    "even an initially supersonic accretion ( such as the wind from the companion ) can fall into this category .",
    "what will happen to such a realistic flow , especially when the specific entropy at the inner sonic point is greater than that at the outer sonic point ?",
    "rcm discovered that a flow injected with these parameters exhibits yet another type of shock - oscillation ( fig .",
    "1c ) . here",
    "the shock searches for a stable location and oscillates without finding it . in the first half of the cycle , the shock recedes far away",
    ", the post - shock region fills up , but the accretion is essentially completely blocked . in the second half of the cycle , the shock pushes the matter into the black hole , thereby evacuating the post - shock region . in a realistic simulation ,",
    "rcm find that while the ratio of actually accreted matter to the amount available from the companion , @xmath47 would be around @xmath48 during the first half - cycle , @xmath49 in the second half - cycle .",
    "the outflow was also found to be very large .",
    "the time scale of oscillation was found to be @xmath50 for a @xmath51 whose infall time is only about @xmath52 .",
    "thus , this type of oscillation takes about a factor of @xmath53 times longer than the resonance oscillation discussed in  2.2 . for a @xmath54 oscillation",
    ", the location of the shock should be obtained from @xmath55 , which gives , @xmath56 for a @xmath11 black hole , a more physically reasonable value .",
    "even though the size of the oscillating region goes down by a factor of @xmath57 or so , compared to that involved in the resonance oscillation , the ejected mass need not go down ( even for the same accretion rate as in the earlier case ) .",
    "this is because nearly all of the accretion flow is accumulated in half the cycle ( @xmath58s in this case ) before being ejected ( see fig .  2 of rcm ) .",
    "another advantage of this type of non - steady shock oscillation is that it is driven by centrifugal force and not by thermal cooling .",
    "hence the result is generally independent of the accretion rate .",
    "thus as long as the viscosity remains low , equivalent to having the shakura - sunyaev ( 1973 ) parameter , @xmath59 ( chakrabarti 1990 ) , and @xmath60 remains fairly constant , this oscillation , once established , could be sustained indefinitely .      in the event of increase in magnetic activity of the disk , as could happen for instance when the accretion disk bends towards the binary companion during its precessional motion , it is not unlikely that a strong magnetic field will be first intercepted , and then advected , toward the inner edge of the disk . in this case the field will preferentially become toroidal due to shear in the rotating flow .",
    "then , as has already been pointed out ( chakrabarti & dsilva 1994 ; nandi et al .",
    "2001 ) the acceleration due to magnetic tension @xmath61 would be the dominant force in the post - shock region of the sub - keplerian flow ( fig .",
    "here , @xmath62 is the major radius of the toroidal flux tube and @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the densities of the medium internal and external to the flux tube respectively .",
    "the last step in eqn .",
    "( 2 ) is written because @xmath65 for a strong flux tube . since @xmath66 and @xmath67 , we get @xmath68 thus increasing rapidly as the tube comes closer to the black hole , and even surpassing the magnetic buoyancy , @xmath69 \\simeq    \\frac{\\lambda_{\\rm kep}^2-\\lambda^2}{r^3},\\ ] ] where @xmath70 , and @xmath71 and @xmath72 are respectively the specific angular momentum of a keplerian disk and the disk under consideration . the accelerations in eqns .  ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) do cross over , since when very close to a black hole , @xmath73 for a sub - keplerian flow .",
    "the effect of magnetic tension is dramatic , and the inner part of the disk is evacuated in the alfvn time scale : @xmath74s , for a @xmath75 black hole with a realistic alfvn speed , @xmath76 ( nandi et al .",
    "the enhanced plasma ejection along the axis presumably causes sporadic magnetic flare events which would be observable as radio outbursts , at the same time reducing the x - ray emission from the disk which forms the base of the jet .",
    "recently , such effects may have been seen ( safi - harb & kotani 2002 ) where simultaneous observations of 2 ghz radio and 220 kev x - ray fluxes from ss 433 have been made , and a clear dip in x - ray flux is seen at the same time a strong radio flare is observed .",
    "it is worth noting that similar anti - correlated variations are common during flares in grs @xmath77 ( feroci et al .",
    "1999 ; naik et al .",
    "2001 ) and we suggest that the flares in ss 433 originate in the same way .",
    "in this _ letter _ , we have studied various competing processes for the creation of bullets which move ballistically in the jet of ss 433 .",
    "we showed that blobs may be separated by : ( 1 ) comptonization ; ( 2 ) shock oscillations due to resonance ; ( 3 ) oscillations due to inherent unsteady accretion solutions ; ( 4 ) intense magnetic tension of the toroidal flux tubes .",
    "we reject the first possibility because it requires a large keplerian disk , which is unlikely .",
    "we are unable to distinguish at this stage which type of shock oscillation is more capable of producing bullet formation in ss 433 , but we prefer the third possibility due to its impulsive and generic nature and smaller involved region .",
    "we believe that the fourth possibility of the inner disk evacuation should produce flaring events , but will occur rather rarely , perhaps only once in a single precession period , when the magnetic field of the companion is preferentially tilted towards the accretion disk during precessional motion .",
    "this fourth mechanism gives rise to an anti - correlation between radio and x - rays , perhaps already observed in ss 433 ( safi - harb & kotani 2002 ) .",
