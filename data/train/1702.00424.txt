    "second , we measure structural dissimilarity @xcite between the model and reconstructed images using the dssim metric adopted in previous work @xcite . since both metrics show a similar trend , we show only the behavior of the nrmse in the figures that follow .    of potential interest for future eht observations is to detect hypothesized blob - like flaring structure(s ) in the accretion flow or jet due to partially heated or overdense plasma ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , image reconstructions can generate artifacts that mimic bright components , making it difficult to identify such signatures accurately .",
    "a useful evaluation tool for imaging techniques is to identify how many bright blobs appear in the reconstructed image .",

    "we also plot the nrmse metric for reconstructed images as well in the bottom panel , along with the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) size of a convolving circular gaussian beam .",
    "the best - case scenario  the differences from the original input due solely to a loss of resolution , not to errors in reconstructing the image  is shown by the black curve labeled `` model '' following previous work @xcite .",

    "the minimum errors are achieved at a resolution of @xmath91% of the diffraction limit , and then the nrmses show a rapid increase in errors at smaller scales , broadly consistent with previous studies on different model images and data products @xcite .",
    "this clearly shows that , on such small scales , the image is no longer sparse and breaks the underlying assumption of both techniques . in contrast ,",
    "tv and @xmath0+tv regularizations show much more modest variations in the super - resolution regime .",

    "indeed , as shown in figure 4 , cs - clean can recover only a tiny fraction of linearly polarized emission , and the reconstructed evpa distribution is inaccurate .",
    "tv regularization , which shows good performances for stokes @xmath3 imaging , is insufficient on its own for polarimetric imaging . the much lower signal - to - noise ratios in stokes @xmath4 and @xmath5 visibilities require a regularization parameter @xmath9210 times larger than for stokes @xmath3 to minimize the validating error of 10-fold cv , resulting in image distributions that are much blurrier than the model images .",
    "the tv - regularized @xmath71 images reconstruct bright emissions better than cs - clean , but there are a lot of artificial diffuse emissions that dominate the nrmses , as seen by the flat curves in figure [ fig : lpol ] ( b ) .",
    "the @xmath0 regularization exhibits better nrmses than cs - clean for both models on most spatial scales .",
    "since @xmath0 regularization suppresses the artificial diffuse emission seen in tv regularization , the achieved nrmse is better than tv until at @xmath93% of the diffraction limit .",

    "the optimal resolution of @xmath94% is comparable to stokes @xmath3 and is the best among the four techniques .",
    "these results clearly shows that @xmath0+tv can achieve the best image fidelity among techniques presented in this paper not only for super - resolution imaging but also more general imaging on scales larger than diffraction limit .",
    "we have presented a new technique for full polarimetric imaging with radio interferometry using sparse modeling . as shown in  [ sec:3 ] and  [ sec:4 ] , @xmath0+tv regularization stably shows better performance than either @xmath0 or tv regularization alone , and than the most widely - used cotton - schwab clean .",
    "this applies regardless of stokes parameters . in particular , the superiority of the combined @xmath0+tv regularization is significant for linear polarizations on a wide range of spatial scales from super - resolution regimes to scales larger than the diffraction limit .    our technique can be applied to most existing radio interferometers whose data products are full complex visibilities in all four stokes parameters .",
    "although we did not image the circular polarization ( stokes @xmath31 ) in this work , our results suggest that @xmath0+tv regularization would likely achieve a better performance than the cotton - schwab clean for circular polarization too , since it is mathematically similar to stokes @xmath4 and @xmath5 imaging .",

    "the disadvantage of this technique is that the optimization problem is highly non - linear and non - convex , and that the solution can potentially be initial - condition dependent not only in stokes @xmath3 but also in stokes @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath4 and @xmath5 images are reconstructed from the polarimetric ratio that can have larger uncertainties than the stokes visibilities , particularly at long baselines , limiting the dynamic range , image sensitivity and optimal spatial resolution .",
    "an alternative , mathematically equivalent way  phase - referencing with self - calibration techniques  will avoid such disadvantages in polarimetric imaging .    future work for the techniques proposed in this paper will include other sparse regularizations for multi - resolution imaging , such as @xmath0+wavelet / curvelet transformation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the application of , and experimentation with other forms of tv would be important .",
    "we have been using the most widely - used isotropic tv @xcite for tv regularization , which preserves sharp edges in the image .",
    "this would be useful for optically thick objects like stars , but might not be optimal for emission from optically thin objects that have smoother edges in general .",
    "an alternative form of sparse regularization in the gradient domain that favors smoother edges is given by , for instance , @xmath97-fold cv for lasso , which can be derived from the image reconstruction of full data sets .",
    "a similar approximation for tv regularization has been also derived very recently @xcite .",
    "these approximations may allow validating errors to be estimated by imaging the full data set just once at each set of regularization parameters .",
    "we will implement these estimators for our algorithm , which will significantly reduce the whole computational time ( @xmath92 10 times shorter for 10-fold cv ) .",
    "we will also work on optimizing and accelerating the mfista algorithms by parallel computing such as gpgpu ( general - purpose computing on graphics processing units ) .",
    "this will be helpful for extending our works to wider - fov imaging or imaging of much larger data sets with many more stations than vlbi networks , such as alma .",
