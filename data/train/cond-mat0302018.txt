    "the exchange interaction between electrons has been studied since the early days of quantum mechanics @xcite and has been reviewed in some classic references,@xcite as well as textbooks.@xcite recently , a promising proposal @xcite has emerged to use the exchange interaction as a tunable qubit - qubit interaction in a quantum computer , with the individual spins of electrons acting as qubits . to satisfy the conditions for constructing a universal quantum computer ,",

    "the order of spins in the state label @xmath36 indicates that the electron in orbital @xmath12 has spin down , the electron in orbital @xmath19 has spin up , and the electron in orbital @xmath31 has spin up .",

    "in this basis , the hamiltonian ( [ spatialhamiltonian ] ) takes the form of a @xmath43 hermitian matrix . like any @xmath44 hermitian matrix",

    "the procedure we have just described is framed within the heiter - london approximation.@xcite the approximation consists in neglecting excited states and has been criticized on the grounds that it does not produce the correct asymptotic behavior in the limit of very large distances .",
    "@xcite however , in the context of our system of interest , this asymptotic limit is not a concern , and moreover , recent studies have verified the utility of the approximation in the case of large ( but not infinite ) inter - dot separation.@xcite we will thus proceed with the hl approximation , which has the advantage of conceptual simplicity and physical clarity . in the three electron case , we show that hund - mlliken ( hm ) calculations , in which double occupation is permitted , support the conclusions of our hl results .",
    "symmetry considerations fundamentally constrain the form of the electron - spin hamiltonian .",
    "the coordinate system used to define @xmath55 and @xmath56 is arbitrary if there is no spin - orbit coupling and no external magnetic field . in this case , the effective spin operator hamiltonian has rotation , inversion , and exchange symmetry .",
    "the coefficients @xmath57 in ( [ spinsum ] ) are strongly constrained by this symmetry .",
    "the hamiltonian can only be a function of the total spin squared @xmath58 , where @xmath59 , @xmath60 , etc .",
    "a scalar such as @xmath61 can not appear in the hamiltonian because of inversion symmetry .",

    "the term proportional to @xmath65 gives rise to the familiar heisenberg interaction .",
    "here we see that in principle higher order interactions may be present in the spin hamiltonian , starting with a fourth order term proportional to @xmath66 . in this highly symmetric situation ,",
    "the eigenstates of the spin hamiltonian are clearly just eigenstates of @xmath67 .",
    "to compute the values of @xmath68 we consider an eigenstate @xmath69 . if there are @xmath16 electrons in the system , we write @xmath70 . to proceed , one ( i )  computes the expectation value of the effective spin hamiltonian ( [ spinhamiltonian ] ) in this state , ( ii )  computes the expectation value of the spatial hamiltonian ( [ spatialhamiltonian ] ) in this state , and then ( iii ) equates the two expectation values : @xmath71 this procedure",
    "is repeated for all eigenvalues of @xmath72 , thus generating a set of linear equations for the parameters @xmath73 , in terms of matrix elements of @xmath74 between different orbital states . for @xmath16 electrons",
    "the number of distinct eigenvalues of @xmath75 is @xmath76 ( where @xmath77 denotes the greatest integer less than @xmath78 , so this is the maximum number of distinct energy eigenvalues of the hamiltonian ( [ spinhamiltonian ] ) .",

    "that @xmath16 is odd @xmath85 takes on the half - integer values @xmath87 . then @xmath88 having completed step ( i ) of our program , we now turn to step ( ii ) , the calculation of @xmath89 .",
    "we make this calculation separately for the cases of two , three and four electrons .      as a simple illustration of our procedure we rederive the well - known result for two electrons : the exchange constant equals the difference between the ( degenerate ) triplet states and the singlet state .",
    "the spin singlet ( @xmath90 )  and spin triplet ( @xmath91 ) states have eigenvalues of @xmath92 equal to @xmath93 and @xmath21 respectively .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian ( [ spinhamiltonian ] ) can only have two distinct eigenvalues , and we need to solve @xmath94 equations for @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",

    "it follows that _ the presence of the third electron quantitatively changes the exchange coupling between the other two electrons_.      we have have been working within the hl approximation in which there is one orbital per quantum dot occupied by a single electron .",

    "the decomposition ( [ spinsum ] ) is no longer meaningful since the basis states do not necessarily have one spin per quantum dot .",
    "this complicates the computation of the eigenspectrum of this @xmath174 -dimensional space .",
    "first , we note that the projection @xmath175 ( the number of spin - up electrons ) is still a good quantum number since the hamiltonian ( [ spatialhamiltonian ] ) can not mix two states with different numbers of spin - up electrons .",

    "the eigenstates exhibit degeneracies arising from the symmetry of the hamiltonian under the exchange of a pair of dots . assuming that our dots are all equivalent , there are three dot - pair exchange operators that commute with the hamiltonian : @xmath180 that exchanges dots @xmath181 , @xmath182 that exchanges dots @xmath183 , and @xmath184 that exchanges dots @xmath185 . for instance , @xmath186 .",
