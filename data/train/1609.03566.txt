    "some of the whim is expected to exist in the outskirts of galaxy clusters .",
    "this whim gradually falls into the clusters and is heated at accretion shocks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , we can understand the process in which the whim turns into the hot intracluster medium ( icm ) in the clusters by exploring the whim in this region .",
    "the outskirts of clusters have been investigated in x - rays especially with _ suzaku _ ( e.g. @xcite , see a recent review by @xcite ) .",
    "many of these observations show that the entropy of the icm in the outskirts of massive clusters is smaller than that predicted by numerical simulations ( e.g. @xcite but see @xcite ) , which may indicate that the heating is less effective than expected ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , the x - ray observations are limited to @xmath6 , where @xmath0 is the radius at which the cluster density is 200 times the critical density at that redshift and is often regarded as the virial radius of the cluster ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in order to understand the heating process , observations of the whim at @xmath7 are crucial .",
    "although the signatures of the ( thermal ) sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect @xcite have been detected at @xmath7 for a number of clusters @xcite , it gives us only the information on the pressure profiles , and the density and the temperature profiles are not obtained separately .",
    "fast radio bursts ( frbs ) are bright , unresolved , millisecond signals .",
    "although their origin is not clear , their large dispersion measures ( dms ) suggest that they are extragalactic @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that the dms of transient objects such as gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and frbs can be used to probe the whim along the line of sight @xcite . in this study",
    ", we propose a new idea to explore the whim by combining the dms of frbs and the sz effect .",
    "we show that this method will reveal the properties of the whim at @xmath7 when observations of frbs with the square kilometre array ( ska ) become available .",
    "we use @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "so far at least 17 frbs have been identified , and a catalogue compiled from the published literature is available .",
    "their dms are @xmath11@xmath12 .",

    ", we find that the average of the dms is @xmath13 and the square root of the unbiased variance is @xmath14 .    in this study , we focus on nearby clusters ( @xmath15 ) and frbs that appear behind them .",
    "indeed , the observed large dms suggests cosmological origins at high redshifts of @xmath161 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if the frbs have a redshift distribution similar to that for grbs , the contribution of foreground frbs can be ignored ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "even if the foreground frbs ( and frbs residing physically inside the cluster ) can not be ignored , ska will be able to identify the host galaxies of the frbs with its excellent resolution @xcite .",
    "once the hosts are identified , the determination of their redshifts will be possible .",
    "the dm of a single frb measured by an observer is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the electron density and @xmath19 is the redshift of the gas ( e.g. equation  ( 4 ) in @xcite ) .",

    "the dm in the direction of a cluster should consist of @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are dm contributions from the frb ( and the surrounding medium ) , the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , the icm , and the milky way galaxy , respectively . from now on ,",
    "the term icm includes the whim in the higher than normal density region around the cluster , unless otherwise mentioned .",
    "moreover , we represent the average of multiple dms by `` @xmath25 '' .",
    "the average @xmath26 should be larger than the average when there is no dm contribution from the icm : @xmath27 note that while the extragalactic contribution , @xmath28 , may be independent of the direction to the frb , @xmath29 may be dependent on direction , because the column density of the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the milky way galaxy varies . in that case , we can use the frbs that are detected around the cluster of interest to determine the local value of @xmath29 . above the galactic plane",
    ", we have estimated that a variation of @xmath24 in even a huge field of 900  @xmath30 centered on the virgo or the coma cluster is only @xmath31 based on a simple milky way model by @xcite .",

    "the error @xmath60 is the uncertainty of @xmath61 that is for the frbs _ detected inside the narrow region_. since @xmath60 is given by @xmath62 , it can not be ignored if @xmath63 is small . thus , we obtain @xmath64 from equation  ( [ eq : ddmc ] ) . in summary ,",

    "if the turbulence that is responsible for the scintillation is a kolmogorov type and the cutoff scale is the same , the strength of the broadening ( scattering measure ; sm ) is proportional to @xmath192 , where @xmath193 is the depth of the intervening medium ( e.g. ism or icm ) along the line of sight @xcite . for the icm , the sm is expected to be large in the inner region of the cluster . at @xmath194  mpc , which is the innermost radius for our analysis , the density is @xmath195 ( fig .",

    "dms of numerous frbs and the sz effect are combined .",

    "hence , it will be important in cluster outskirt studies to reduce the level of foreground contamination in @xmath73 maps at large angular scales .",
    "the combination of our method and x - ray observations can be useful .",

    "note that while the @xmath73 parameter depends linearly on @xmath36 as does the dm ( equation  ( [ eq : y ] ) ) , its behavior may be different from that of the dm .",
    "for example , if the clump size is relatively large and the icm is in pressure equilibrium on that scale , the dm values depend on whether the line - of - sight to a frb crosses one or more clumps because the column density fluctuates , while the @xmath73 parameter is not much affected by the clumping .",
    "the large - scale structure filaments that connect clusters are also expected to have the whim @xcite , although it is difficult to detect the sz effect toward them because they are usually located at @xmath208 .",

    "however , this degeneracy can be resolved by an observation of line emissions from the filament .",
    "for example , the whim is expected to radiate ovii and oviii line emissions @xcite , and the line surface brightness varies as @xmath212 .",

    "when ska2 becomes available , the sensitivity will increase by a factor of 10 compared with ska1 , which means that the required exposure time will be significantly reduced .",
    "moreover , if the origin of the dispersion , @xmath215 , is revealed , its influence on the error , @xmath216 ( equation  ( [ eq : ddmicm ] ) ) , can be decreased by considering an appropriate correction based on this knowledge .",
    "for example , if the dms of frbs vary with the distance and the positions of the hosts are known well enough to get a redshift , the distance dependence can be removed .",
    "this could greatly reduce the uncertainty of the dm values , and make the errors in our method much smaller .",
    "although we have focused on individual cluster measurements , this method can be readily generalized to study a stacked ensemble of high - redshift clusters or group - sized systems .",
    "the canadian hydrogen intensity mapping experiment and the next generation very large array may also be useful for this study .",

    "in contrast with forward modeling ( section  [ sec : result ] ) , backward modeling does not require an icm model for fits . however , it has a drawback that we need to use a derivative of the data ( see equations  ( [ eq : nicm ] ) and  ( [ eq : picm ] ) ) , which can magnify noise in the data .",
    "moreover , the errors of the icm data in the inner region are affected by those in the outer region ( see equations  ( [ eq : nicm_num ] ) and  ( [ eq : picm_num ] ) ) , which may complicate the comparison between the data and a model . however , it is instructive to compare the results of the backward modeling with those of the forward modeling when the icm profile is rather smooth and the data have less noise .",
