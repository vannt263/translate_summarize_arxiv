    "one example is packing spheres with a famous application to the liquid of hard spheres with the topological disorder still not understood .",
    "intuitively , solid infinite cylinders should be more cumbersome because they can be entangled . indeed , unlike compact bodies such as spheres",
    ", the infinite cylinders can touch one another at any distance , producing infinitely long spatial correlations .",
    "this may explain why for the whole history the first attempt to deal with the cylinders ( finite rigid rods ) was made by lars onsager only in 1949 .",
    "it has long been known how to make mutually touch seven half - infinite cylinders , yet , the configuration essentially makes use of the possibility of three half - infinite cylinders to lie in one plane while touching both each other and the pivotal cylinder with their stumps .",
    "placing other three cylinders right over them produces the configuration needed .",
    "however , being half - infinite is crucial for topology : a half - infinite cylinder does not `` puncture '' the space . in 1986 , in connection with the continuum percolation problem , we analyzed the possibility of arranging mutually touching arbitrary infinite cylinders invoking the method of degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the method prompted only possible solutions to be found either numerically or analytically .",
    "we predicted that seven mutually touching cylinders might exist and the configuration might not be rigid .    in 2004",
    "we discovered @xcite that the configuration of seven mutually touching straight round infinite cylinders indeed had a numerical solution ( while solving 10 equations for 10 variables ) , which we named 7-knot .",
    "the configuration keeps its topology when one remaining degree of freedom ( predicted in @xcite being the scissor angle @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) between two chosen cylinders : the pivotal 0th cylinder ( red ) and the 1st cylinder ( brown ) in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) , changes .",
    "the rigorous nonlinear equations for the angles and positions ( see below ) , which provide orientations of each cylinder to be touching all the others were solved with a renown mathcad program with a computational accuracy of order of @xmath1 ( all relevant files with the texts of the mathcad programs as well as animations are given in online resources 1 - 8 ) ) .",

    "we succeeded @xcitein discovering other topologies and published the result with the 7-knot of the mutually touching infinite cylinders of equal radii ( the congruent one , here equipped with asterisk : 7 * -knot ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1]b ) in @xcite and fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "however , probably because the results of constructing pure mathematical bodies were embedded into the physical context , the findings remained unknown for the mathematical community .",
    "a recent paper @xcite rediscovered our finding of mutually touching seven infinite equal radii cylinders , the authors being unaware of our earlier results with cylinders of equal and non - equal radii and of the nuances of their topology .",
    "it may illustrate a still existing gap between the worlds of physics and mathematics though both are intimately connected through the plato s world @xcite .",
    "meantime , the obvious difference between 7-knot and 7 * -knot pushed us forward in curiosity questions about the topology of entanglement of the cylinders that constitute 7-knots , the limits of angles and radii where they exist , calculating the latitudinal and longitudinal angles while the scissor angle @xmath0 sweeps from the zero value to @xmath11 etc .",
    "also there is the question of quantification of the difference in the topology between the configurations of the 7-knot with a set of non - equal radii that can be continuously reduced to 7 * -knot with equal cylinders , and the basins of sets of non - equal radii that can not be continuously reduced to the equal radii .",
    "the switching between the topologies always happens through infinity while the cylinders try to become parallel which is a kind of degeneracy .",
    "therefore some orientational entanglement takes place which might be important to be understood on the basic level of straight infinite cylinders .    here , we reveal the detailed structure of 7-knot along with our finding that natural extension to 8-and 9-knots does exist , as predicted in @xcite .",
    "we computed the 8-knot and the ultimate 9-knot .",
    "these novel configurations of mutually touching round infinite cylinders lack the angular degrees of freedom because of having too many mutual contacts .",
    "it is not at all obvious that such rigid configurations should exist and simple comparison with the circles and spheres below illustrate the whole problem of the degrees of freedom for 7- , 8- , and 9- knots .",

    "having @xmath25 indicates that the fourth circle should have a predetermined radius ; others are changeable ( so - called apollonius circles ) .",
    "the next case is more dramatic : @xmath26 gives us @xmath27 .",
    "this should be enough because we still have @xmath28 radii to be adjusted as we please ( more precisely , four radii , because one radius should be a measuring unit ) .",
    "however , such an ultimate ( one can not put @xmath29 because @xmath30 is out of range , only @xmath28 radii out of @xmath31 can be changeable ) configuration does not exist .",

    "for example , exactly like in the 7-knot with equal cylinders only three cylinders : 6th ( violet ) , 3rd ( green ) , and 2nd ( blue ) are unknotted for 9-knot .",

    "( [ eq:18 ] ) which was the consequence of constructing the 9-knot by introducing the ninth cylinder into the previous 8-knot configuration and then recalculating .",
    "it is for now an open question whether other topologies exist for 9-knot .",
    "we have given only a glimpse of a rich world of geometry of cylinder configurations that is to be revealed in detail .",
    "numerous generalizations and questions come to mind , such as : what if the cylinders are having arbitrary cross - sections : elliptic , polygonal , or just a segment , a cylinder being degenerated into a flat band ( excluding though the degenerate solutions of more than two edges touching in just one point ) ?",
    "what if such bands are not flat , what if the axes of the cylinders are arbitrary curves that still connect `` one infinity '' with the other one , etc . ?",
    "with the help of our method of calculating the degrees of freedom it is possible to estimate the relevant numbers but there should be advanced analytics or computations to make sure whether an arrangement is realizable like it happened in case of 7- , 8- , and 9-knots .    in our previous works it was already shown that entanglement of the cylinders brings unconventional mechanical ( auxetic ) properties to the ensembles of cylinders by using 6-knots as building blocks .",
    "now we introduced a matrix that identifies the topology of cylinder configurations and probably may be used for a description of ensembles of entangled cylinders or rods that goes beyond the usual onsager approximation of low packing density and pairwise interaction of rigid rods . on this way one may expect more complicated entangled and thermodynamically stable structures than the well - known nematic ordering of rigid rods to exist , for example , similar to spin - glasses .",
    "many objects in the field theory such as strings and vortexes have the geometry of cylinders .",
    "the difference between the cylinder and the sphere may resemble the difference between particles with spin and spinless particles .",
    "one may notice an intriguing parallel between the geometry of infinite cylinders , punching the `` celestial sphere '' , and twistor geometry of light rays @xcite .",
    "a light ray in this picture lies along the axis which is not structureless but is equipped with the information of the helicity ( chirality ) .",
    "contacting cylinders and other cylinder - like geometrical constructions may provide a complementary picture for twistors . note that as we showed above just a configuration of two cylinders produces chirality similar to the helicity of the twistor @xcite .",
    "we found here that the topology of entanglement of cylinders can be described in easier ( and one to one ) manner than for conventional one - component knots .",
    "this finding may be useful for the information theory as well .",
    "we anticipate that some confusion with the terminology may occur in future .",
    "there has been a term of n - knot which is a single n - dimensional sphere @xmath173 embedded in m - dimensional sphere @xmath174 .",
    "therefore it might be needed to alter our term `` n - knot '' for a configuration of n mutually touching cylinders for something that we may suggest to be `` n - cross '' .",
