    "one of the oldest open problems in theoretical physics is that of describing fully developed turbulence on the basis of a microscopic model . the latter is usually taken to be the stochastic navier  stokes ( ns ) equation subject to an external random force that models the energy injection by the large - scale modes ; see , e.g. ,",
    "the aim of the theory is to verify the basic principles of the celebrated kolmogorov ",
    "obukhov phenomenological theory , study deviations from this theory , determine the dependence of various correlation functions on the times , distances , external ( integral ) and internal ( viscous ) turbulence scales , and derive the corresponding scaling dimensions .",
    "most results of this kind were obtained within the framework of numerous semiphenomenological models that can not be considered to be the basis for construction of a regular expansion in certain small ( at least formal ) parameter @xcite .",
    "an important exception is provided by the renormalization group ( rg ) method that was earlier successfully applied in the theory of critical behavior to explain the origin of critical scaling and to calculate universal quantities ( critical dimensions and scaling functions ) in the form of the @xmath1 expansions @xcite .",
    "the rg approach to the stochastic ns equation , pioneered in @xcite , allows one to prove the existence of the infrared ( ir ) scale invariance with exactly known `` kolmogorov '' dimensions and the independence of the correlation functions of the viscous scale ( the second kolmogorov hypothesis ) , and calculate a number of representative constants in a reasonable agreement with experiment . detailed review of the rg theory of turbulence and more references can be found in @xcite .",
    "the standard rg formalism is applicable to the stochastic ns equation if the correlation function of the random force is chosen in the form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the momentum ( wave number ) , @xmath2 is the space dimension and the exponent @xmath1 plays the part analogous to that played by @xmath5 in the rg theory of critical behavior .",
    "although the results of the rg analysis are reliable and internally consistent for small @xmath1 , the possibility of their extrapolation to the real value @xmath6 ( see below ) and thus their relevance for the real fluid turbulence was called in question in a number of studies , e.g. @xcite .    the crucial role in recent studies of intermittency and anomalous scaling of fluid turbulence",
    "was played by a simple model of a passive scalar quantity advected by a random gaussian field , white in time and self - similar in space , the so - called kraichnan s rapid - change model @xcite . there , for the first time the existence of anomalous scaling was established on the basis of a microscopic model @xcite and the corresponding anomalous exponents were calculated within controlled approximations @xcite and numerical experiments @xcite .",
    "detailed review of the recent theoretical research on the passive scalar problem and more references can be found in @xcite .",
    "the field theoretic rg and the operator product expansion ( ope ) were applied to the rapid - change model in @xcite .",
    "the rg allows one to construct a systematic perturbation expansion for the anomalous exponents , analogous to the @xmath7 expansion in models of critical behavior , and to calculate the exponents to the second @xcite and third @xcite orders . for passively advected vector fields",
    "the exponents for higher - order correlation functions were derived by means of the rg techniques to the leading order in @xmath1 in refs .",
    "it was shown that the knowledge of three terms allows one to obtain reasonable predictions for finite @xmath8 ; even the plain @xmath1 expansion captures some subtle qualitative features of the anomalous exponents established in numerical experiments @xcite .",
    "in contrast to standard @xmath9 model of critical behavior @xcite , where the critical exponents are known up to the order @xmath10 ( five - loop approximation ) , and to the rapid - change model , where the anomalous exponents are known up to @xmath11 , all the calculations in the rg approach to the stochastic ns equation have been confined with the simplest one - loop approximation .",
    "the reason for this distinction is twofold .",
    "first , any multiloop calculation for this dynamical model is a demanding job : one can say that the two - loop calculation for the stochastic ns equation is as cumbersome as the four - loop calculation for the conventional @xmath9 model .",
    "second , the critical dimensions for the most important physical quantities ( velocity and its powers , frequency , energy dissipation rate and so on ) are given by the one - loop approximation exactly ( the corresponding @xmath1 series terminate at first - order terms ) and the higher - order calculations for them are not needed .",
    "however , the @xmath1 series for other important quantities do not terminate and the calculation of the higher - order terms for them is of great interest . in this paper",
    ", we present the results of the two - loop calculation for a number of such quantities : the @xmath0 function , the coordinate of the rg fixed point , the ultraviolet ( uv ) correction exponent @xmath12 , the kolmogorov constant @xmath13 and the inertial - range skewness factor @xmath14 .",
    "the knowledge of higher - order terms is also important to judge about the validity and convergence properties of the @xmath1 expansions in the models of turbulence on the whole .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we introduce the stochastic ns equation paying special attention to the choice of the random force correlator and the physical value of the parameter @xmath1 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : qft ] we recall the field theoretic formulation of the model , diagrammatic technique , renormalization and rg equations . since the `` ideology '' of the rg and ope approach to the stochastic ns model is explained in refs .",
    "@xcite in detail , here we confine ourselves to only the necessary information . in sec .",
    "[ sec : zz ] we present in detail the two - loop calculation of the renormalization constant , rg functions , coordinate of the fixed point and the uv correction exponent .",
    "we explain some tricks ( e.g. an appropriate choice of the ir cutoff ) that essentially simplify the calculation and make it feasible .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : pair ] we calculate two orders of the @xmath1 expansion for the pair correlation function of the velocity field ( this accuracy is consistent with the two - loop calculation of the rg functions in sec .",
    "[ sec : zz ] ) .",
    "they are used later in sec .",
    "[ sec : ck ] in the calculation of the skewness factor and the kolmogorov constant .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : bsk ] we discuss on the example of the pair correlation function the possibility of the extrapolation of the @xmath1 expansion to finite values of @xmath1 .",
    "we explain an important distinction that exists between the rg technique and the traditional approach based on diagrammatic self - consistency equations and argue that , contrary to what is sometimes claimed , the rg is applicable beyond the threshold where the so - called sweeping effects become important , but one should combine the rg with the ope and go beyond the plain @xmath1 expansions .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : ck ] we perform the two - loop calculation of the kolmogorov constant @xmath13 and the inertial - range skewness factor @xmath14 .",
    "the new point is not only the inclusion of the second - order correction , but also the derivation of @xmath13 through an universal ( in the sense of the theory of critical behavior ) quantity .",
    "this allows us to circumvent the main drawback of earlier calculations of @xmath13 : the intrinsic ambiguities in the corresponding @xmath1 expansions .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , the _ inertial - range _ skewness factor @xmath14 has never been calculated earlier within the rg approach .",
    "the experience on the rg theory of critical behavior shows that for dynamical models the higher - order corrections are not small , and in order to obtain reasonable predictions , say , for critical exponents , one should augment the plain @xmath1 expansions by additional information obtained from the instanton calculus and pad  borel summations ; the situation for the _ amplitudes _ in scaling laws is even worse ( see e.g. @xcite ) . surprisingly enough , in our case already the first - order results are in a reasonable agreement with experiment , which is not destroyed by the inclusion of the second - order corrections .",
    "it turns out that the experimental value of @xmath13 and @xmath14 lie in between of the two consecutive approximations , like for the exactly solvable heisenberg model @xcite .",
    "the main conclusion of the paper is that the renormalization group and the @xmath1 expansion allow one to derive a number of important characteristics of the real fluid turbulence beyond the simplest first - order approximations and in a good agreement with the experiment .",
    "as the microscopic model of the fully developed , homogeneous , isotropic turbulence of an incompressible viscous fluid one usually takes the stochastic ns equation with a random driving force @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the transverse ( due to the incompressibility ) vector velocity field , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the pressure and the transverse random force per unit mass ( all these quantities depend on @xmath19 ) , @xmath20 is the kinematical viscosity coefficient , @xmath21 is the laplace operator and @xmath22 is the lagrangian derivative . the problem ( [ 1.1 ] ) is studied on the entire @xmath23 axis and is augmented by the retardation condition and the condition that @xmath16 vanishes for @xmath24 .",

    "the time decorrelation of the random force guarantees galilean invariance of the full stochastic problem ( [ 1.1 ] ) , ( [ 1.2 ] ) .",
    "let us specify the form of the function @xmath28 in the correlator ( [ 1.2 ] ) used in the rg theory of turbulence ; more detailed discussion is given in refs .",

    ", the random force models the injection of energy to the system owing to interaction with the large - scale eddies . idealized injection by infinitely large eddies corresponds to @xmath31 , more precisely , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the average power of the injection ( equal to the average dissipation rate ) and the amplitude factor comes from the exact relation @xmath34 on the other hand , for the use of the standard rg technique it is important that the function @xmath35 have a power - law behavior at large @xmath4 .",
    "this condition is satisfied if @xmath35 is chosen in the form @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the amplitude factor and @xmath38 is the exponent with the physical value @xmath39 ( see below ) .",

    ". it then follows that for @xmath46 , the function ( [ 1.10 ] ) turns to the ideal injection ( [ 2.75 ] ) if the amplitude @xmath47 is related to @xmath33 as @xmath48    a more realistic model , used e.g. in @xcite , is @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the reciprocal of the integral turbulence scale @xmath51 and @xmath52 is some well - behaved function that provides the ir regularization .",
    "its specific form can be chosen to simplify the practical calculation in higher orders ; see sec .",

    "all the results of the rg analysis are reliable and internally consistent for small @xmath1 ; the possibility of their extrapolation to the real value @xmath6 was called in question in a number of studies , e.g. @xcite .",
    "we shall return to this important issue later , and here we only note that the replacement of the ideal injection ( [ 2.75 ] ) by the power - law model ( [ 1.10 ] ) followed by the use of the @xmath1 expansion was confirmed by the example of the exactly solvable heisenberg model @xcite .",
    "detailed exposition of the rg theory of turbulence and the bibliography can be found in @xcite ; below we restrict ourselves to only the necessary information .",

    "due to the nonlinear nature of the problem , they enter the corresponding ope s as infinite families whose spectra of dimensions are not bounded from below , and in order to find the small-@xmath138 behavior one has to sum up all their contributions in the representation ( [ sde ] ) .",
