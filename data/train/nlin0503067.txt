    "quantum billiards , that is , closed compact domains in the two - dimensional euclidean plane , are the simplest model of a quantum system corresponding to physical instances such as quantum dots or microstructures",
    ". the statistical properties of the quantum energy levels of such systems have been investigated , and it turns out that the statistical quantum behaviour can be related to the classical properties of the system .",
    "it is believed that systems whose classical motion is chaotic have energy levels behaving like eigenvalues of random matrix ensembles @xcite , whereas the energy levels of systems whose classical motion is integrable are poisson distributed , i.e. they behave like independent uniformly distributed random variables @xcite . both numerical evidence and some analytical results support these conjectures @xcite .",
    "+ among systems which are classically neither chaotic nor integrable , some systems have been found to display an eigenvalue statistics which is intermediate between the poisson and the random matrix distribution .",
    "the characteristics of such intermediate statistics are @xcite level repulsion , exponential decrease of the nearest - neighbour spacing distribution at infinity and linear asymptotic behaviour of the number variance ( which is related to a non - vanishing form factor at small arguments ) .",
    "the form factor at the origin is equal to @xmath4 for classically integrable systems , to @xmath5 for chaotic systems , and it is found numerically to take values between 0 and 1 for intermediate statistics , the case @xmath6 corresponding to semi - poisson statistics @xcite .",
    "numerous quantum systems have been found to display numerically intermediate statistics : for example , pseudo - integrable systems such as rational polygonal billiards ( polygons in which all angles are commensurate with @xmath7 ) @xcite , or quantum maps @xcite . +",
    "an analytical approach to the study of level statistics is the semiclassical trace formula , which gives an expansion of the density of energy levels as a sum over periodic orbits @xcite , or families of periodic orbits in the case of integrable systems @xcite . for diffractive systems",
    ", the trace formula can be modified to include diffractive orbits contributions @xcite .",
    "it can be argued however ( see @xcite for a discussion ) that only the periodic orbits contribute to the semiclassical form factor at small arguments , @xmath3 .",
    "the calculation of this quantity therefore only requires to find the periodic orbits and the areas occupied by the pencils of periodic orbits in a given system .",
    "unfortunately , this is not a simple task .",
    "for instance is is not known whether any acute triangle has a periodic orbit . in the case of rational polygonal billiards ,",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the number @xmath8 of periodic orbits of length less than @xmath9 is quadratically bounded , namely there exist @xmath10 and @xmath11 such that @xmath12 , but even for general rational polygonal billiards exact asymptotics is not known . there",
    "exist however certain specific rational polygonal billiards for which more precise statements are known .",
    "for instance for veech billiards @xcite , a special class of rational polygonal billiards ( whose stabilizer is a discrete cofinite subgroup of @xmath13 ) , precise asymptotics for @xmath8 is known , and in @xcite it was possible to calculate analytically the form factor at the origin for triangular veech billiards .",
    "+ this paper presents the calculation of the semiclassical form factor at the origin for a billiard which does not have this special veech property , the barrier billiard .",
    "the barrier billiard is one of the simplest pseudo - integrable billiards .",
    "it was introduced by hannay and mccraw @xcite and consists of a rectangle @xmath14\\times[0,b]$ ] containing a barrier described by the segment @xmath15 $ ] with @xmath16 ( see figure [ billard ] left ) .",
    "it is a rational polygonal billiard with six angles equal to @xmath17 and one angle equal to @xmath18 .",
    "it is therefore a pseudo - integrable billiard @xcite , and the movement in phase space takes place on a surface of genus 2 .",
    "when the height of the barrier is such that @xmath19 then the barrier billiard is a veech billiard .",
    "but when @xmath20 is irrational the billiard loses this property .",
    "nevertheless , from results obtained in @xcite , it is still possible to work out the distribution of the periodic orbits in this latter case , and thus calculate analytically the semiclassical form factor at the origin , provided the position of the barrier is a rational number with respect to the size of the side : @xmath21 with @xmath22 coprime .",
    "we will first devise a method to obtain a complete characterization of the periodic orbit pencils in the non - veech barrier billiard ( section [ section3 ] ) .",
    "we then rigourously derive asymptotics for each family of periodic orbit pencils ( section [ onpeutremplacer ] ) , then use this result to calculate the semiclassical form factor at small arguments ( section [ calculff ] ) . previously obtained analytical results show that the semi - classical form factor at the origin takes non - universal values between 0 and 1 . for veech triangular billiards with angles @xmath23 , the value @xmath24 with @xmath25 or @xmath26 was found @xcite . for a rectangular billiard perturbed by an aharonov - bohm flux line",
    ", we obtained @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the strength of the magnetic flux and @xmath29 a rational depending on the position of the flux line in the billiard ( for irrational positions , @xmath30 ) @xcite .",
    "for a circular billiard perturbed by an aharonov - bohm flux line , a similar result @xmath31 , with @xmath32 $ ] an explicit function of the position of the flux , was derived @xcite . in the case of the barrier billiard ,",
    "we obtain @xmath33 .",
    "this value depends on the position of the barrier inside the rectangle , which reflects the fact that the structure and the properties of periodic orbits strongly depend on it .",
    "this analytical expression for @xmath34 extends previous results to the case of non - veech polygonal billiards .",
    "the aim of this section is to characterize periodic orbits in a barrier billiard .",
    "we first begin by the simple case of a rectangular billiard .",
    "let us consider a rectangle of area @xmath35 with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "it is easy to work out the density of the lengths of periodic orbits .",
    "any orbit in the rectangle can be unfolded into a straight line in a torus ( a rectangle with periodic boundary conditions ) of size @xmath36 ; a periodic orbit is therefore defined by two integers @xmath37 and @xmath38 and has length @xmath39 if we restrict ourselves to @xmath40 in the upper right quadrant , each family of periodic orbits occupies an area @xmath41",
    "( @xmath42 for the orbit itself , @xmath42 for its time - reverse ) .",
    "the number @xmath43 of pencils of length less than @xmath44 is just the number of lattice points @xmath45 within a ( quarter of a ) disk of radius @xmath44 .",
    "it has the asymptotic expression @xmath46 .",
    "the corresponding density of periodic orbits is the derivative of @xmath43 : @xmath47 the density of primitive periodic orbits is given by ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath48 we want to obtain a similar result for the barrier billiard . in the rest of this section",
    "we investigate the periodic orbits of the barrier billiard , and section [ onpeutremplacer ] leads to equation which gives the density of primitive periodic orbits for the barrier billiard .      instead of studying directly the barrier billiard itself",
    ", we will consider the equivalent problem of studying the translation surface associated to this billiard @xcite .",
    "a construction due to zemlyakov and katok @xcite shows that the translation surface associated to a generic rational polygonal billiard is obtained by unfolding the polygon with respect to each of its sides , which means gluing to the initial polygon its images by reflexion with respect to each of its sides and repeating the operation .",
    "if the angles of the polygon are @xmath49 and @xmath38 is the least common multiple of the @xmath50 , then @xmath51 copies of the initial billiard are needed . here",
    "all the angles are multiples of @xmath17 , therefore only 4 copies are needed , and the translation surface @xmath52 obtained by this construction is represented in figure [ billard ] ( right ) . in this surface , all opposite sides are identified .",
    "any trajectory in the barrier billiard can be unfolded to a straight line on the translation surface .",
    "the surface @xmath52 is of genus 2 : there are two singular angles of measure @xmath53 that we will represent respectively by @xmath54 ( a dot in figure [ billard ] ) and @xmath55 ( a cross in figure [ billard ] ) .",
    "the two singularities are traditionally called saddles @xcite and a geodesic joining them is called a saddle - connexion .      in this subsection",
    ", our aim is to describe qualitatively the periodic orbits in the barrier billiard in a given direction . on translation surfaces the periodic orbits occur in pencils , or cylinders , of periodic orbits of same length .",
    "these cylinders are bounded by saddle - connexions and are characterized by their length and their height .",
    "let us consider a rational direction on the translation surface @xmath52 : @xmath56 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 two coprime positive integers .",
    "the length of the vector @xmath57 is @xmath58 let us label by the integers @xmath59 , 1 , ... , @xmath60 the positions on the translation surface such that the barrier on the  left  of the translation surface in figure [ billard ] be at position @xmath61 and the barrier on the  right  in figure [ billard ] be at position @xmath62 ( see figure [ unfolded ] ) .",
    "since the opposite sides on the translation surface are identified , then when a trajectory hits the barrier at position @xmath61 it reappears at position @xmath62 , and vice - versa .",
    "the translation by vector @xmath57 induces a permutation @xmath63 of the positions @xmath64 .",
    "let us define @xmath65 and in the same way @xmath66 a translation by the vector @xmath67 takes @xmath54 to itself and defines a saddle - connexion of length @xmath68 .",
    "the second saddle - connexion joining @xmath54 to itself starts at position @xmath62 and its length is @xmath69 .",
    "+ figure [ unfolded ] shows , as an example , the two saddle - connexions going from @xmath54 to itself in the direction @xmath70 for @xmath71 .",
    "the translation by the vector @xmath57 induces the permutation @xmath72 .",
    "one of the saddle - connexions goes from the position 0 to itself and has a length @xmath73 ; the other goes from position 2 to itself via position 1 and has a length @xmath74 . in any direction",
    ", there are always two saddle - connexions going from @xmath54 to itself , and , in the same way , two from @xmath55 to itself .",
    "these four saddle - connexions form the boundary of three cylinders of periodic orbits ( see figure [ 3cylindres ] ) .",
    "the lengths of these cylinders are necessarily of the form @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath75 , with @xmath76 , and their heights @xmath77 are such that @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 for some @xmath81 and @xmath82 , the fractional part of @xmath83 .",
    "for instance in figure [ 3cylindres ] , there is one cylinder immediately above the saddle - connexion @xmath84 , one immediately above the saddle - connexion @xmath85 , and the third cylinder is below both .",
    "the results of this section can be summed up as follows .",
    "we set @xmath86 so that @xmath87 and @xmath88 are integers .",
    "then in each direction @xmath57 defined by @xmath40 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 coprime , there are three cylinders of periodic orbits of lengths @xmath89 and heights @xmath77 with @xmath90 .",
    "the cylinders can be described by the following five characteristic numbers :    * the integers @xmath91 and @xmath92 ( giving the lengths of the two short cylinders and the length @xmath75 of the long cylinder ) * the real number @xmath93 ( giving the height @xmath94 of the long cylinder ) * the integers @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( giving the heights @xmath95 and + @xmath96 of the short cylinders ) .",
    "note that by definition of the @xmath97 we need to have @xmath98 .",
    "also note that the condition that the sum of the areas of the cylinders be @xmath41 can be expressed as @xmath99 .",
    "let us define @xmath100 as the set of all 4-uples @xmath101 such that @xmath102 are coprime and @xmath99 .",
    "we say that a direction @xmath57 belongs to the family @xmath103 if the three cylinders in the direction @xmath57 have the characteristic numbers @xmath104 .",
    "the goal of this section is to calculate , for a fixed family @xmath103 and a fixed interval @xmath105 , the asymptotics for the number @xmath106 of directions @xmath57 belonging to the family @xmath107 , such that @xmath108 and such that the height @xmath93 of the third cylinder in the direction @xmath57 belongs to the interval @xmath109 .",
    "the asymptotics for the number @xmath110 of cylinders of length less than @xmath44 have been calculated in @xcite .",
    "these asymptotics are obtained by applying a siegel - veech formula to the space @xmath111 of @xmath112-fold coverings of the torus with two branch points and area 1 .",
    "if @xmath113 is the set of vectors associated with cylinders of periodic orbits on a stable @xmath112-fold torus cover @xmath52 , then it is shown that there is a constant @xmath114 depending only on the connected component @xmath115 of @xmath111 containing @xmath52 , such that @xmath116 is the ball of radius @xmath117 centered at the origin .",
    "the constant @xmath29 is given by the following siegel - veech formula : for any continuous compactly supported @xmath118 , @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the siegel - veech transform of @xmath121 defined by @xmath122 and @xmath123 is the measure on @xmath111 ( theorem 2.4 of @xcite ) .",
    "this theorem applies to the translation surface constructed from the barrier billiard , provided @xmath52 be a stable @xmath112-fold torus cover , which is true only if the height @xmath20 of the barrier is irrational .",
    "it is shown that in this case @xmath115 is the set @xmath124 of primitive torus covers .",
    "the following asymptotics are then obtained ( here we have a factor 1/16 differing from the factor in @xcite because of our conventions for the counting of the time - reverse partner of a periodic orbit ) : @xmath125 the constant @xmath126 is given by @xmath127 ( the gcd of @xmath128 will be noted either @xmath129 or simply @xmath130 ) , and @xmath131 ( proposition 4.14 of @xcite ) .",
    "the constant @xmath132 is the number of primitive covers of degree @xmath112 of a surface of genus 2 with 2 branch points .",
    "the proof leading to equation can be adapted to any subset of @xmath113 provided it varies linearly under @xmath13 action , i.e. provided the subset verifies @xmath133 , @xmath134 ( see section 2 of @xcite for more detail ) . to obtain the asymptotics for a fixed pair @xmath135 with @xmath136 and @xmath109 an interval , @xmath105 , let us define @xmath137 the set of vectors @xmath138 defined by , such that the triple of cylinders in the direction @xmath57 belongs to the family @xmath107 , with @xmath139 . then along the same lines of the proof of theorem 2.4 in @xcite",

    "we take @xmath121 to be the characteristic function of a disc of radius @xmath150 in @xmath151 .",
