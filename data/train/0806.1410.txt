    "monte carlo methods @xcite appeared about sixty years ago with the need to evaluate numerical values for various complex problems .",
    "these methods evolved and were applied early to quantum problems , thus putting within reach exact numerical solutions to non - trivial quantum problems @xcite .",
    "many improvements of these methods followed , avoiding critical slowing down near phase transitions and allowing to work directly in the continuous imaginary time limit @xcite . in recent years ,",
    "interest in methods that work in the canonical ensemble with global updates yet allow access to green functions has intensified @xcite .",
    "however , a method that works well for a given hamiltonian often needs major modifications for another .",
    "for example , the addition of a 4-site ring exchange term in the bosonic hubbard model required special developments for a treatment by the stochastic series expansion algorithm @xcite , as well as by the wordline algorithm @xcite .",
    "this can result in long delays .",
    "it is , therefore , advantageous to have at one s disposal an algorithm that can be applied to a very wide class of hamiltonians without requiring any changes . in a recent publication @xcite ,",
    "the stochastic green function ( sgf ) algorithm was presented , which meets this goal .",
    "the algorithm can be applied to any lattice hamiltonian of the form @xmath3 where @xmath1 is diagonal in the chosen occupation number basis and @xmath2 has only positive matrix elements .",
    "this includes all kinds of systems that can be treated by other methods presented in ref.@xcite , for instance bose - hubbard models with or without a trap , bose - fermi mixtures in one dimension , heisenberg models ... in particular hamiltonians for which the non - diagonal part @xmath2 is non - trivial ( the eigen - basis is unknown ) are easily treated , such as the bose - hubbard model with ring exchange @xcite , or multi - species hamiltonians in which a given species can be turned into another one ( see eq.([twospecies ] ) and fig .",
    "[ density ] and [ momentum ] for a concrete example ) .",
    "systems for which it is not possible to find a basis in which @xmath1 is diagonal and @xmath2 has only positive matrix elements are said to have a `` sign problem '' , which usually arises with fermionic and frustrated systems . as other qmc methods , the sgf algorithm does not solve this problem .    the algorithm allows to measure several quantities of interest , such as the energy , the local density , local compressibility , density - density correlation functions ... in particular the winding is sampled and gives access to the superfluid density .",
    "equal - time n - body green functions are probably the most interesting quantities that can be measured by the algorithm , by giving access to momentum distribution functions which allow direct comparisons with experiments .",
    "all details on measurements are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "in addition the algorithm has the property of being easy to code , due in part to a simple update scheme in which all moves are accepted with a probability of 1 . despite of such generality and simplicity ,",
    "the algorithm might suffer from a reduced efficiency , compared to other algorithms in situations where they can be applied .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a `` directed '' update scheme that ( i ) keeps the simplicity and generality of the original sgf algorithm , and ( ii ) enhances its efficiency by improving the sampling over the imaginary time axis .",
    "while the sgf algorithm is not intended to compete with the speed of other algorithms , the improvment resulting from the directed update scheme is remarkable ( see section v ) .",
    "but what makes the strength of the sgf method is that it allows to simulate hamiltonians that can not be treated by other methods or that would require special developments ( see eq.([twospecies ] ) for a concrete example ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we introduce in section ii the notations and definitions used in ref.@xcite . in section iii , we propose a simplification of the update scheme used in the original sgf algorithm , and determine how to satisfy detailed balance .",
    "a generalization of the simplified update scheme is presented in section iv , which constitutes the directed updated scheme .",
    "finally section v shows how to determine the introduced optimization parameters , and presents some tests of the algorithm and a comparison with the original version .",
    "in this section , we recall the expression of the `` green operator '' introduced in the sgf algorithm , and the extended partition function which is considered . although not required for understanding this paper , we refer the reader to ref.@xcite for full details on the algorithm . as many qmc algorithms ,",
    "the sgf algorithm samples the partition function @xmath4 the algorithm has the property of working in the canonical ensemble . in order to define the green operator ,",
    "we first define the `` normalized '' creation and annihilation operators , @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the usual creation and annihilation operators of bosons , and @xmath8 is the number operator . from ( [ normalizedoperators ] )",
    "one can show the following relations for any state @xmath9 in the occupation number representation , @xmath10 with the particular case @xmath11 .",
    "appart from this exception , the operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 change a state @xmath9 by respectively creating and annihilating one particle , but they do not change the norm of the state .    using the notation @xmath14 to denote two subsets of site indices @xmath15 and @xmath16 with the constraint that all indices in subset @xmath17 are different from the indices in subset @xmath18 ( but several indices in one subset may be equal ) , we define the green operator @xmath19 by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a matrix that depends on the application of the algorithm @xcite . in order to sample the partition function ( [ partitionfunction ] ) , an extended partition function @xmath22 is considered by breaking up the propagator @xmath23 , and introducing the green operator between the broken parts , @xmath24 defining the time dependant operators @xmath25 and @xmath26",
    ", @xmath27 and working in the occupation number basis in which @xmath1 is diagonal , the extended partition function takes the form @xmath28 where the sum @xmath29 implicitly runs over complete sets of states @xmath30 . we will systematically use the labels @xmath31 and @xmath32 to denote the states appearing on the left and the right of the green operator , and use the notation @xmath33 to denote the diagonal energy @xmath34 .",
    "we will also denote by @xmath35 and @xmath36 the time indices of the @xmath2 operators appearing on the left and the right of @xmath19 .    as a result ,",
    "the extended partition function is a sum over all possible configurations , each being determined by a set of time indices @xmath37 and a set of states @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40,@xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "the algorithm consists in updating those configurations by making use of the green operator . assuming that the green operator is acting at time @xmath43",
    ", it can `` create '' a @xmath2 operator ( that is to say a @xmath2 operator can be inserted in the operator string ) at the same time , thus introducing a new intermediate state , then it can be shifted to a different time . while shifting , any @xmath2 operator encountered by the green operator is `` destroyed '' ( that is to say removed from the operator string ) . assuming a left ( or right ) move , creating an operator will update the state @xmath44 ( or @xmath41 ) ,",
    "while destroying will update the state @xmath41 ( or @xmath44 ) .",
    "when a diagonal configuration of the green operator occurs , @xmath45 , such a configuration associated to the extended partition function ( [ extendedpartitionfunction ] ) is also a configuration associated to the partition function ( [ partitionfunction ] ) .",
    "measurements can be done when this occurs ( see ref.@xcite for details on measurements ) .",
    "next section presents a simple update scheme that meets the requirements of ergodicity and detailed balance .",
    "before introducing the directed update , we start by simplifying the update scheme used in the original sgf algorithm",
    ".      we will assume in the following that a left move of the green operator is chosen .",
    "in the original version , the green operator @xmath26 can choose to create or not on its right a @xmath2 operator at time @xmath43 .",
    "then a time shift @xmath46 to the left is chosen for the green operator with an exponential distribution in the range @xmath47 .",
    "if an operator is encountered while shifting the green operator , then the operator is destroyed and the move stops there . as a result , four possible situations can occur during one move :    1 .   no creation , shift , no destruction .",
    "2 .   creation , shift , no destruction .",
    "3 .   no creation , shift , destruction .",
    "4 .   creation , shift , destruction .",
    "it appears that the first possibility `` no creation , no destruction '' is actually useless , since no change is performed in the operator string . the idea is to get rid of this possibility by forcing the green operator to destroy an operator if no creation is chosen",
    "a further simplification can be done by noticing that the last possibility `` creation , destruction '' is not necessary for the ergodicity of the algorithm , and can be avoided by restricting the range of the time shift after having created an operator .",
    "therefore we replace the original update scheme by the following : we assume that the green operator is acting at time @xmath43 and that the operator on its left is acting at time @xmath35 . the green operator @xmath26 chooses to create or not an operator on its right at time @xmath43 .",
    "if creation is chosen , then a time shift @xmath46 of the green operator is chosen to the left in the range @xmath48 , with the probability distribution defined below .",
    "if no creation is chosen , then the green operator is directly shifted to the operator on its left at time @xmath35 , and the operator is destroyed . as a result",
    "only two possibilities have to be considered :    1 .",
    "creation , shift .",
    "2 .   shift , destruction .",
    "figure [ simplfiedupdatescheme ] shows the associated organigram .",
    "section iii.b explains how detailed balance can be satisfied with this simplified update scheme .          when updating the configurations according to the chosen update scheme , we need to generate different transitions from initial to final states with probabilities that satisfy detailed balance . in this section",
    "we propose a choice for these probabilities , and determine the corresponding acceptance factors .",
    "we denote the probability of the initial ( final ) configuration by @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath51 the probability of the transition from configuration @xmath17 to configuration @xmath52 , and by @xmath53 the probability of the reverse transition .",
    "finally we denote by @xmath54 the acceptance rate of the transition from @xmath17 to @xmath52 , and by @xmath55 the acceptance rate of the reverse transition .",
    "the detailed balance can be written as @xmath56 we will make use of the metropolis solution @xcite , @xmath57 with @xmath58 we will use primed ( non - primed ) labels for states and time indices to denote final ( initial ) configurations .",
    "we consider here the case where a left move is chosen , an operator is created on the right of the green operator at time @xmath43 , and a new state is chosen .",
    "then a time shift to the left is chosen for the green operator in the range @xmath59 .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath60 and @xmath61 correspond to the time indices of the operators appearing on the left and the right of the green operator after the new operator has been inserted , that is to say at the moment where the time shift needs to be performed .",
    "thus we have @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the probability of the initial configuration is the boltzmann weight appearing in the extended partition function ( [ extendedpartitionfunction ] ) : @xmath64 the probability of the final configuration takes the form : @xmath65 it is important here to realize that the green operator only inserted on its right the operator @xmath66 , before being shifted from @xmath61 to @xmath67 .",
    "therefore we have the equalities @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "the probability @xmath51 of the transition from the initial configuration to the final configuration is the probability @xmath72 of a left move , times the probability @xmath73 of a creation , times the probability @xmath74 to choose the new state @xmath75 , times the probability @xmath76 to shift the green operator by @xmath77 , knowing that the states on the left and the right of the green operator at the moment of the shift are @xmath78 and @xmath79 : @xmath80 the probability of the reverse transition is simply the probability @xmath81 of a right move , times the probability of no creation , @xmath82 : @xmath83\\ ] ] from the original version of the sgf algorithm , we know that choosing the time shift with an exponential distribution is a good choice , because it cancels the exponentials appearing in the probabilities of the initial ( [ initial ] ) and final ( [ final ] ) configurations , avoiding exponentially small acceptance factors .",
    "however a different normalization must be used here , since the time shift is chosen in the range @xmath84 instead of @xmath47 .",
    "the suitable solution is : @xmath85 it is straightforward to check that the above probability is correctly normalized and well - defined for any real value of @xmath86 , the particular case @xmath87 reducing to the uniform distribution @xmath88 ( note that @xmath89 is always a positive number ) . for the probability @xmath74 to choose the new state @xmath75 ,",
    "the convenient solution is the same as in the original version : @xmath90 putting everything together , the acceptance factor ( [ metropolis2 ] ) becomes @xmath91\\big[1-e^{-(\\tau_l^\\prime-\\tau_r^\\prime)(v_r^\\prime - v_l^\\prime)}\\big]}{v_r^\\prime - v_l^\\prime},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the notation @xmath92 to emphasize that this acceptance factor corresponds to a creation .",
    "it is also important for the remaining of this paper to note that @xmath92 is written as a quantity that depends on the initial configuration , times a quantity that depends on the final configuration .",
    "we consider here the case where a left move is chosen , and the operator on the left of the green operator is destroyed .",
    "this move corresponds to the inverse of the above `` creation , shift '' move .",
    "thus , the corresponding acceptance factor @xmath93 is obtained by inverting the acceptance factor @xmath92 , exchanging the initial time @xmath43 and final time @xmath67 , and switching the direction .",
    "however @xmath94 represents an absolute time shift , so @xmath35 and @xmath36 do not have to be exchanged .",
    "we get @xmath95\\big[1-e^{-(\\tau_l-\\tau_r)(v_l - v_r)}\\big ] } \\\\                             & \\times & \\frac{\\big\\langle\\psi_l^\\prime\\big|\\hat\\mathcal g\\big|\\psi_r^\\prime\\big\\rangle p(\\rightarrow^\\prime)p_\\rightarrow^\\dagger(\\tau^\\prime)}{\\big\\langle\\psi_l^\\prime\\big|\\hat\\mathcal t\\hat\\mathcal g\\big|\\psi_r^\\prime\\big\\rangle},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is written as a quantity that depends on the initial configuration , times a quantity that depends on the final configuration .",
    "we will use here the short notation @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 to denote respectively the quantities @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have some freedom for the choice of the probabilities of choosing a left or right move , @xmath72 and @xmath102 , and the probabilities of creation @xmath73 and @xmath103 .",
    "a suitable choice for those probabilities can be done in order to accept all moves , resulting in an appreciable simplification of the algorithm . for this purpose ,",
    "we impose the acceptance factor @xmath92 ( or @xmath104 ) to be equal to the acceptance factor @xmath93 ( or @xmath105 ) .",
    "this allows to determine the probabilities @xmath73 and @xmath103 , @xmath106 and the acceptance factors @xmath107 and @xmath108 take the form @xmath109 with @xmath110 finally we can impose the acceptance factors @xmath111 and @xmath112 to be equal .",
    "this implies @xmath113 defining @xmath114 , we are left with a single acceptance factor , @xmath115 which is independent of the chosen direction , and independent of the nature of the move ( creation or destruction ) .",
    "thus all moves can be accepted by making use of a proper reweighting , as explained in ref .",
    "the appendix shows how to generate random numbers with the appropriate exponential distribution ( [ exponentialdistribution ] ) .      although the above simplified update scheme works , it turns out to have a poor efficiency .",
    "this is because of a lack of `` directionality '' : the green operator has , in average , a probability of @xmath116 to choose a left move or a right move .",
    "therefore the green operator propagates along the operator string like a `` drunk man '' , with a diffusion - like law .",
    "the basic creation and destruction processes correspond to the steps of the random walk .",
    "this suggests that the efficiency of the update scheme can be improved if one can force the green operator to move in the same direction for several iterations .",
    "next section presents a modified version of the simplified update scheme , which allows to control the mean length of the steps of the random walk , that is to say the mean number of creations and destructions in a given direction .",
    "the proposed directed update scheme can be considered analogous to the `` directed loop update '' used in the stochastic series expansion algorithm @xcite , which prevents a worm from going backwards .",
    "however the connection should not be pushed too far .",
    "indeed the picture of a worm whose head is evolving both in space and imaginary time accross vertices is obvious in a loop algorithm . in such algorithm ,",
    "a creation ( or an annihilation ) operator which is represented by the head of a worm is propagated both in space and imaginary time , while an annihilation ( or a creation ) operator represented by the tail of the worm remains at rest .",
    "the loop ends when the head of the worm bites the tail .",
    "such a worm picture is not obvious in the sgf algorithm : instead of single creation or annihilation operators , it is the full green operator over the whole space that is propagated only in imaginary time .",
    "this creates open worldlines , thus introducing discontinuities .",
    "these discontinuities increase or decrease while propagating in imaginary time .",
    "all open ends of the worldlines are localized at the same imaginary time index .",
    "therefore it is actually not possible to draw step by step a worm whose head is evolving in space and imaginary time until it bites its tail .",
    "we present in this section a directed update scheme which is obtained by modifying slightly the simplified update scheme , thus keeping the simplicity and generality of the algorithm .      assuming that a left move is chosen",
    ", the green operator chooses between starting the move by a creation or a destruction . after having created ( or destroyed ) an operator , the green operator can choose to keep moving in the same direction and destroy ( or create ) with a probability @xmath117 ( or @xmath118 ) , or to stop .",
    "if it keeps moving , then a destruction ( or creation ) occurs , and the green operator can choose to keep moving and create ( or destroy ) with a probability @xmath118 ( or @xmath117 ) ... and so on , until it decides to stop . if the last action of the move is a creation , then a time shift is chosen .",
    "the organigram is represented in figure [ directedupdatescheme ] .          in order to satisfy detailed balance , in addition to the acceptance factors @xmath92 and @xmath93 , we need to determine new acceptance factors of the form @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "we first determine the new expressions of @xmath92 and @xmath93 resulting from the directed update scheme . for @xmath92 ,",
    "the previous probability @xmath51 has to be multiplied by the probability to stop the move after having created , @xmath121 .",
    "the previous probability @xmath53 has to be multiplied by the probability to stop the move after having destroyed , @xmath122 .",

    ", we impose to all acceptance factors corresponding to left ( or right ) moves to be equal .",
    "this requires the intermediate acceptance factors @xmath165 and @xmath166 ( or @xmath179 and @xmath180 ) to be equal to 1 .",
    "this is realized if @xmath181 where @xmath182 and @xmath183 are optimization parameters belonging to @xmath184 . by tuning these parameters , the mean length of the steps of the green operator",

    "note that we have explicitly excluded @xmath185 from the allowed values for these optimization parameters .",
    "this is necessary for the green operator to have a chance to end in a diagonal configuration , @xmath45 .",

    "this definition ensures that @xmath197 is independent of the time of the simulation . as a result ,",
    "the larger @xmath197 the more efficient the algorithm .    in the present case",
    "we have @xmath203 , while @xmath204 for the original sgf algorithm .",
    "it is useful here to realize that , by symmetry , the mean values of @xmath118 and @xmath177 ( and @xmath117 and @xmath178 ) must be equal .",
    "therefore we define @xmath205 and @xmath206 .",
    "it seems reasonable to impose a condition of uniform sampling , @xmath207 .",
    "this condition can be satisfied by adjusting dynamically the values of @xmath182 and @xmath183 during the thermalization process . for this purpose",
    "we introduce a new optimization parameter @xmath208 and apply the following algorithm from time to time while thermalizing ( we start with @xmath209 ) : @xmath210 thus we are left with the optimization parameter @xmath211 . in order to determine the optimal value ,",
    "we have considered 2 different hamiltonians @xmath212 and @xmath213 , and evaluated the efficiency of the algorithm while scanning @xmath211 .",
    "the first hamiltonian we have considered describes free hardcore bosons and is exactly solvable , @xmath214 where the sum runs over pairs of first neighboring sites and @xmath215 is the hopping parameter .",
    "the second hamiltonian is highly non - trivial and describes a mixture of atoms and diatomic molecules , with a special term allowing conversions between the two species @xcite , @xmath216 where @xmath217 and @xmath218 ( @xmath219 and @xmath220 ) are the creation and annihilation operators of atoms ( molecules ) , @xmath221 , @xmath222 , @xmath223 , @xmath224 , and @xmath225 are respectively the hopping parameter of atoms , the hopping parameter of molecules , the atomic onsite interaction parameter , the molecular onsite interaction parameter , and the inter - species interaction parameter .",
    "the conversion term is tunable via the parameter @xmath226 and does not conserve the number @xmath227 of atoms or the number @xmath228 of molecules",
    ". however the total number of particles @xmath229 is conserved and is the canonical constraint .",
    "the parameter @xmath230 allows to control the ratio between the number of atoms and molecules .",
    "the application of the sgf algorithm to the hamiltonian ( [ twospecies ] ) is described in details in ref.@xcite .",
    "the changes coming with the directed update scheme are completely independent of the chosen hamiltonian .",
    "the following table shows the mean number of creations and destructions in one step , @xmath231 , and the relative efficiency @xmath232 of the algorithm applied to @xmath212 at half filling , for which we have measured the energy @xmath233 , the superfluid density @xmath234 , and the number of particles in the zero momentum state @xmath235 :    .",

    "the improvment of the efficiency is remarkable . in the following ,",
    "we illustrate the applicability of the algorithm to problems with non - uniform potentials , by adding a parabolic trap to the hamiltonian ( [ twospecies ] ) : @xmath238 the parameters @xmath239 and @xmath240 allow to control the curvature of the trap associated to atoms and molecules , respectively , and @xmath31 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "the inclusion of this term in the algorithm is trivial since only the values of the diagonal energies @xmath241 and @xmath242 are changed .",
