    "although stable champs are predicted in some extensions of the standard model , astrophysical constraints plus bounds from underground detectors , from balloon experiments and the lack of detection of anomalous hydrogen in the sea water , basically rule out champs as dark matter ( see perl et al .",

    "in particular , the non - detection of heavy water in the sea excludes champs with masses between @xmath2 and @xmath3 tev ( verlerk et al .",
    "all the above constraints were derived for the standard flux of particles at earth from the galactic halo .",
    "if magnetic fields prevent the flux of champs to penetrate the galactic disk , one must reevaluate earlier bounds ( chuzhoy & kolb 2008 ) .",
    "essentially all @xmath4 should have bound to protons , forming neutrachamps , which decouple from the photon - baryon fluid and drive structure formation prior to recombination .",
    "neutrachamps reach earth unimpeded .",
    "searches for neutrachamps in cosmic rays rule out particles with masses between @xmath5 and a few @xmath3 tev ( barwick et al .  1990 )",
    ". nevertheless , heavy - water searches , cosmic rays searches , and constraints from overproduction of @xmath6li ( berger et al .  2008 ) are only relevant if champs are singly charged , because for other charges , a champ no longer behaves like a proton .",
    "if a significant fraction of the mass of halos is made up by champs , it may have a strong impact on the observable universe ( e.g. , chuzhoy & kolb 2008 ) .",
    "it is therefore important to constrain the abundance of champs in galactic halos . after revising galactic requirements for champs to be absent in the galactic disk",
    ", we give an upper limit on the abundance of champs in the galactic halo .",
    "while neutrachamps have no difficulties to penetrate the galactic disk and the solar wind to reach earth , the penetration of unneutralized champs may be impeded by the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "denote by @xmath7 the electric charge of champs in units of @xmath8 , the elementary electron charge . for",
    "@xmath9 tev and @xmath10 , champs in the galactic halo behave as a collisionless plasma because the self - collision time is @xmath11 gyr and the mean free path is @xmath12 kpc .",
    "such a plasma consists of charged particles influenced only by gravity and electromagnetic fields",
    ". we will consider first the interaction of halo champs with the galactic magnetic field .",
    "it is well - known that when charged particles interact with a magnetized body , a boundary layer that divides two regions with different conditions is created ( parks 1991 ) .",
    "thus , charged particles will penetrate this boundary by some distance before they are turned around by the @xmath13 force ( figure [ fig : boundary ] ) .",
    "the boundary layer is formed because of the partial penetration of the charged particles before they are deflected back .",
    "the orbits described by negative and positive charged particles in the neighborhood of the magnetic boundary are drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : boundary ] .",
    "since the galactic magnetic field is not perfectly plane - parallel and has a nonzero turbulent component , i.e.  @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the regular ( homogeneous ) magnetic field and @xmath16 denotes the turbulent field , the particle motion is determined not only by the average magnetic field but also by scattering at field fluctuations , a stochastic process which requires the solution of transport equations with particle ensembles .",
    "depending on the magnitude of these fluctuations , we distinguish between weak and strong turbulence which leads to different physical phenomena ( kallenrode 1998 ) .",
    "particle propagation in turbulent fields can be understood as a diffusive process , reason why we consider the spatial diffusion of _ collisionless _ halo champs into the galactic disk .",
    "the diffusion timescale @xmath17 accross the galaxy disk thickness @xmath18 for a halo champ , is bracketted in the range : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the diffusion coefficients parallel and transverse to the mean component of the magnetic field , which is observed to be parallel to the disk . within the disk , the magnetic field",
    "can be considered static because alfvn waves propagate with velocities of the order of the alfvn speed @xmath22 km s@xmath23 , which is smaller than the typical velocities of champs @xmath24 , where @xmath25 km s@xmath23 is the one - dimensional velocity dispersion for halo particles .",
    "the diffusion coefficients depend on the turbulence level @xmath26 , and on the rigidity @xmath27 , with @xmath28 the larmor radius defined with respect to the total magnetic field and @xmath29 the maximum scale of the turbulence @xmath30 ( giacalone & jokipii 1999 ; casse et al .",
    "observations of the galactic polarized synchrotron background yield @xmath31 ( fletcher & shukurov 2001 , and references therein ) , implying that @xmath32 .",
    "since @xmath17 scales as the inverse of the diffusion coefficients and those are essentially a monotonic function of @xmath33 , we use @xmath34 in our estimate of @xmath21 in order to give an upper limit on the diffusion timescale . taking advantage of the numerical result by casse et al .",
    "( 2002 ) that @xmath35 for kolmogorov turbulence with @xmath36 and @xmath37 between @xmath38 and @xmath39 , we find that @xmath40 therefore , the present configuration and strength of the galactic magnetic field can prevent diffusion of ( unaccelerated ) champs across the galactic disk in the life time of the disk for mass particles @xmath41 tev .",
    "the corresponding gyroradius for a mass of @xmath42 tev moving at @xmath43 km s@xmath23 in a field of @xmath44 g is @xmath45 pc .",
    "it is likely that champs are accelerated to much higher velocities by supernova shocks .",
    "the inclusion of this effect would give a more constraining upper limit on @xmath46 .",
    "in the preceding section we have seen that halo champs with masses @xmath41 may have difficulty penetrating the magnetized galactic disk , whereas those inside it stay confined to the disk .",
    "trapped particles in the disk gain energy through electrostatic fields , fermi acceleration in shock waves , and its descendants ( e.g. , blandford 1994 ) , and loss kinetic energy due to coulomb scatterings with electrons and protons of the diffuse interstellar gas .",
    "the dissipation timescale is @xmath47 , with @xmath48 and @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the electron density ( @xmath51 @xmath52 in the solar vicinity ) and the coulomb logarithm has a value of about @xmath53 .",
    "champs may avoid strong cooling if the dissipation timescale @xmath54 for champs trapped on the disk be greater than the shock acceleration timescale @xmath55 .",
    "since @xmath56 gyr , the condition @xmath57 gyr implies @xmath58 this constraint is valid for any value of @xmath7 provided that @xmath46 is larger than the electron mass @xmath59 mev .",

    "[ sec : shielding ] and eq .",
    "( [ eq : cooling ] ) .",
    "champs in region `` 2 '' can be suspended in the halo without penetrating the disk and may be very evasive for direct terrestrial detection because the flux of champs reaching earth may be highly suppressed . if champs are thermal relics , they must also satisfy the unitary bound @xmath62 tev ( griest & kamionkowski 1990 ) . combining this constraint with eq .",
    "( [ eq : cooling ] ) , we find @xmath63 for thermal relics .",
    "for simplicity , let us assume for a moment that the galactic magnetic field is horizontal . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : boundary ] , champs with @xmath64 tev execute approximately half a gyro - orbit before finding themselves back in the unmagnetized region and with velocities directed away from the magnetized region .",
    "this leads to the plasma being excluded from the magnetized disk . in the boundary layer",
    ", a current layer develops as a result of a thermal , unmagnetized plasma interacting with a magnetized region .",
    "it is a classical result that the ( kinetic ) motions of individual particles in collisionless plasmas can be reconciled with the role inferred for the pressure in mhd ( e.g. , king & newmann 1967 ; cravens 1997 ) .",
    "for example , in a boundary layer like the terrestrial magnetopause , the thermal ( or kinetic ) pressure of the solar wind is balanced by the pressure of the terrestrial magnetic field and this separates the interplanetary magnetic field from the magnetospheric cavity .",
    "suppose that champs can not penetrate down to @xmath65 because of the galactic magnetic barrier ( see  [ sec : shielding ] ) .",
    "since champs are essentially collisionless , the magnetic field is the only agent that may support the weight of the champs in the halo . integrating the equation of vertical equilibrium from @xmath65 to @xmath66 , assuming zero pressure at @xmath66 , and ignoring the weight of coronal gas",
    ", we find @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the magnetic pressure , @xmath69 the mass density of champs and @xmath70 the vertical positive gravitational acceleration .",
    "for a spherical dark halo , the contribution of champs to the weight term at the solar vicinity is @xmath71 where @xmath72 is defined as the mass fraction of dark matter in champs .",
    "the weight of the champs produces a confinement effect .",
    "interestingly , the observed synchrotron emission above the plane in the solar neighbourhood implies that the scale height of the magnetic field is greater than what would be inferred from the weight distribution of the interstellar matter ( e.g. , cox 2005 ) . by requiring that the confinement of the magnetic pressure is entirely due to the weight of the champs , an upper value on the abundance of champs can be derived .",
    "the observed synchrotron emission above the plane in the solar neighbourhood indicates that the total magnetic field strength is @xmath73 g at a height of @xmath74 kpc ( ferrire 2001 ; cox 2005 ; gaensler et al .",
    "if we identify @xmath75 as the hwhm of the magnetoionic disk @xmath76 kpc ( e.g. , kalberla 2003 ) and by equating the magnetic pressure at @xmath77 kpc with the weight term , we obtain the desired constraint on @xmath72 , once adopting the highest magnetic value of @xmath44 g allowed by observations : @xmath78 this constraint is independent of charge @xmath7 .",
    "this estimate is very robust to the precise value adopted for @xmath75 because the magnetic field decays very slowly with @xmath79 .    in our derivation",
    ", we have assumed that the halo is spherical .",
    "consider now an oblate isothermal dark halo with axis ratio @xmath80 : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the asymptotic circular velocity at the equatorial plane and @xmath83 , with @xmath84 . in this model ,",
    "the velocity dispersion is given , within less than @xmath85 , by @xmath86 , for flattening @xmath87 ( e.g.  gerhard & silk 1996 ) . even though the velocity dispersion for @xmath88 is smaller than in the spherical case , the weight term changes only by @xmath89 as compared to the spherical case , even for rather flattened halos ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "so far , it was assumed that champs and neutrachamps are well mixed .",
    "now , we relax that assumption and search for the distributions of neutrachamps and champs that allow to have the largest mass in champs .",
    "this occurs when champs have an almost zero vertical dispersion and settle on to layers of negligible thickness at @xmath91 , but neutrachamps populate a spherical halo .",
    "the vertical density profile of champs is then @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the surface density of champs at @xmath94 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : graveq ] ) , we obtain that @xmath95 at @xmath65 .",
    "taking @xmath96 cm s@xmath97 at @xmath74 kpc ( e.g. , holmberg & flynn 2004 ) , we find @xmath98 m@xmath99 pc@xmath97 or , equivalently , @xmath100 .",
    "however , it is difficult to justify this additional degree of freedom in the model until a non - gravitational mechanism for so efficiently dissipation of champ s energy is satisfactorily established . in addition , it is likely that parker instabilities will destroy these cold layers of champs if they are sustained against gravity by magnetic fields .",
    "consider now a portion of the disk at larger galactocentric distances , say @xmath101 .",
    "following the same procedure than in the solar neighbourhood , we need to estimate the total magnetic pressure at @xmath102 , which should be responsible to give support to the halo champs .",
    "the large - scale magnetic field may have a scaleheight @xmath103@xmath2 times the scaleheight of the neutral gas disk , so that we may assume that @xmath104 .",
    "the random magnetic field is expected to be roughly in equipartition with the kinetic energy in the turbulence .",
    "therefore , its vertical scaleheight should be similar to that of the gas .",
    "if magnetic fields are still a barrier for halo champs , then we may assume that @xmath105 and , consequently , the magnetic pressure by the random component at @xmath75 is less than @xmath85 the pressure by the random field at @xmath106 . collecting both contributions , we derive an upper limit for the total magnetic pressure at @xmath75 : @xmath107 where @xmath108 , with @xmath109 and @xmath110 evaluated at @xmath106 .",
    "the ordered magnetic field is difficult to measure in the outer galaxy , but there is evidence that it decays with radius @xmath111 as a power - law between @xmath112 and @xmath113 , probably as @xmath114 with @xmath115 kpc ( heiles 1996 ; han et al .",
    "the uniform magnetic field in the solar neighbourhood is @xmath116@xmath117 g , depending on the authors ( beck 2002 ; han et al .",
    "if we generously take a value in the solar circle of @xmath117 g we infer a strength @xmath118 g at @xmath119 .",
    "assuming a spherical dark halo with a mass density at @xmath119 of @xmath120 , then @xmath121 . at @xmath119 , our assumption that the halo is spherical is a very good approximation ( e.g. , belokurov et al .",
    "2006 ; fellhauer et al .",
    "by imposing pressure balance at @xmath65 ( eq .  [ eq : graveq ] ) , the following constraint for @xmath72 is inferred @xmath122 other observational estimates assure our generously - taken magnetic intense .",
    "in fact , data from rotation measurements of pulsars suggest uniform magnetic fields of @xmath123 g at @xmath124 ( rand & lyne 1994 ) , which coincides with the extrapolation of the fit of radial variation of the regular field by han et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .    beyond @xmath119",
    "it is uncertain if supernovae shocks are able to clean the disk from champs",
    ". it might be also possible that beyond the optical radius , the magnetic field is too weak to prevent champs from crossing the disk , but any more complicated analysis is useless in the face of such ignorance .",
    "we conclude that charged particles can be suspended in the halo , so that they would be impossible to detect as they never reach the earth",
    ". however , the mass fraction of bare champs in the halo must be rather small @xmath125 . in a @xmath126-@xmath4 symmetric universe",
    ", neutrachamps may compose a fraction @xmath127 , because the ratio of their relative abundances may be as much as 10:1 ( dimopoulos et al .",
    "therefore , champ models require three ingredients : neutrachamps , champs and neutral dark matter .",
    "one possibility is that @xmath128 because positive champs and neutrachamps are expected to be approximately in equal numbers . ] at early times and champs decay to neutral dark matter with a lifetime @xmath129 gyr to reach @xmath130 at present .",
    "our upper limit on @xmath72 rules out champs as an explanation for the formation of constant density cores in dark matter halos .",
    "the reduction of the central density after they have driven the formation of galactic halos would be insignificant .",
    "even if all the champs were depleted from the central parts of the galaxies , the rotation velocity in a certain galaxy would suffer a negligible change of @xmath131 for @xmath132 . if champs decay to neutral particles , @xmath72 was larger in the past .",
    "in such scenario , the formation of cores may result from the evacuation of champs in the central regions of galaxies by supernova shocks , provided that the decay times @xmath133 gyr .",
    "combined with the constraint that the decay times @xmath129 gyr , discussed in our previous section , a fine - tuning of the decay time is required .",
    "magnetic fields couple champs with themselves and with ordinary matter .",
    "this coupling might cause ram pressure stripping of both baryonic and dark matter of subhalos and satellite systems . consider , for instance , the collision of two galaxy clusters .",
    "estimates for the magnetic field strength in clusters range from roughly @xmath134 g at the center and @xmath135 g at a radius of @xmath136 mpc , values that correspond to a plasma beta for the champs , @xmath137 , a hot plasma . even in this dynamically weak magnetic field ,",
    "the mean gyroradius for a champ with @xmath138 tev , is @xmath139 pc at the center and @xmath140 pc at @xmath136 mpc .",
    "the governing equations of collisionless hot plasmas were developed by chew et al .",
    "( 1956 ) , whose theory is known as the chew - goldberger - low approximation .",
    "this approximation , which leads to mhd equations with anistropic pressure , is satisfactory when the larmor frequency is large compared to other characteristic frequencies of the problem and the mean particle gyroradius is short compared to the distance over which all the macroscopic quantities change appreciably ( e.g. , spitzer 1962 ; schmidt 1966 ) .",
    "therefore , charged massive particles in the halo of galaxy clusters can be described in the fluid - like anisotropic mhd approximation ; in the merger process , they would behave as a clump of fluid , experiencing ram pressure stripping and drag deceleration similar to the gas component .",
    "since champs should be attached to the gas component , the observed offset between the centroid of dark matter and the collisional gas of the subcluster in the bullet cluster implies @xmath141 ( e.g. , natarajan et al .",
    "2002 ; markevitch et al .",
    "2004 ) . although the current lensing data accuracy is not sufficient to derive the mass distribution of the subcluster in the bullet cluster , the derived mass estimates of the subcluster leave little room for dark matter in the gas bullet",
    ".    galactic halo champs may also exert ram pressure on the gas component of the lmc and its stream due to their continuous scattering by the intrinsic magnetic field of the lmc and the magellanic stream . for a milky way - type halo of @xmath142 m@xmath99",
    ", a fraction @xmath72 of @xmath143 implies that the mass in champs could be up to @xmath144 m@xmath99 and the density at @xmath145 kpc of @xmath146 m@xmath99 pc@xmath147 . since these values are smaller than those required to explain the mass and extension of the magellanic stream and the size and morphology of the gaseous disk of lmc ( mastropietro et al .",
    "2005 ) , we can not reduce any further our upper limit on @xmath72 with the current observations of the lmc disk and the magellanic stream .",
    "whilst the common wisdom holds that dark matter is neutral and collisionless , it is important to explore the possibility of it having nonzero , not necessarily integer , charge .",
    "we have considered the pressure support of champs in our galaxy to derive a simple , upper limit on the fraction of champs and millichamps , @xmath125 .",
    "if @xmath72 was roughly constant over time , this constraint rules out champs as the origin of the cores in lsb and dwarf galaxies . in the range of astrophysical interest",
    ", champs behave like strongly interacting ( fluid - like ) dark matter ( sidm ) .",
    "thus , they face many of the problems attributed to sidm . as some examples , we have discussed the survival of the magellanic stream and the mass distribution of the bullet cluster .",
    "our constraint that the mass in champs in the galaxy is not larger than the mass of coronal gas in the halo seems to apply also to galaxy clusters .",
