    "many different categorical structures involve certain limits and colimits connected by exactness conditions which state , roughly speaking , that limits and colimits in the category interact in the same way that they do in the category of sets ; or better perhaps , that they interact in the same way that they do in any topos .",
    "for example , we have the structure of regular category , which can be characterized as the existence of finite limits and coequalizers of kernel pairs , along with the condition that these coequalizers are stable under pullback . as evidence that this condition characterizes the interaction between finite limits and coequalizers of kernel pairs in a topos ,",
    "we have on the one hand , the fact that any topos is a regular category , and on the other hand , the theorem of barr @xcite which asserts that any small regular category has a fully faithful embedding in a topos , and this embedding preserves coequalizers of kernel pairs and finite limits .    then again , there is the structure of extensive category , which can be characterized as the existence of finite coproducts and pullbacks along coproduct injections , along with the condition that these coproducts are stable under pullback and disjoint . once again , every topos is extensive , and every small extensive category has a fully faithful embedding in a topos , and this embedding preserves finite coproducts and all existing ( finite ) limits @xcite .",
    "the notion of adhesive category was introduced in @xcite as a categorical framework for graph transformation and rewriting ; see the volume @xcite for more on this point of view .",
    "adhesive categories are the analogue of extensive categories where one works with pushouts along a monomorphism rather than coproducts ; the definition is recalled in the following section . once again , every topos is adhesive , as shown in @xcite and in theorem  [ thm : topos - adh ] below , and it is natural to ask whether there is a corresponding embedding theorem .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that this is the case : every small adhesive category has a fully faithful embedding in a topos , and this embedding preserves pushouts along monomorphisms and all existing finite limits .",
    "i am grateful to bill lawvere for suggesting the question .    in each case",
    "the construction is essentially the same .",
    "the yoneda embedding @xmath0 $ ] preserves all existing limits , but few colimits ; in order to correct this we replace @xmath1 $ ] by the full subcategory of sheaves for a topology on @xmath2chosen so that the representables are sheaves and the restricted yoneda embedding @xmath3 preserves the colimits in question .",
    "a general analysis of the sorts of colimits and exactness properties that can be dealt with in this way will be given in @xcite .    from a model - theoretic point of view",
    ", these embedding theorems can be viewed as completeness results . in the case of adhesive categories , for instance , since every topos is adhesive , and every ( small ) adhesive category has a fully faithful embedding into a topos preserving pushouts along monomorphisms and pullbacks , the adhesive category axioms capture that fragment of the structure of a topos which involves pushouts along monomorphisms and pullbacks .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed treatment of this point of view .",
    "recall that a category @xmath2with finite coproducts is _ extensive _ if for all objects @xmath4 and @xmath5 the coproduct functor @xmath6 is an equivalence of categories .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that @xmath2has finite coproducts and pullbacks along coproduct injections , and in a commutative diagram @xmath7 \\ar[d ] & e \\ar[d ] & b ' \\ar[l ] \\ar[d ] \\\\ a \\ar[r ] & a+b & b \\ar[l ] } \\ ] ] in which the bottom row is a coproduct , the top row is a coproduct if and only if the squares are pullbacks .    in a pushout square @xmath8^g \\ar[d]_f & b \\ar[d ] \\\\ a \\ar[r ] & d } \\ ] ] the role of the morphisms @xmath9 and @xmath10 is entirely symmetric , but sometimes we wish to think of it non - symmetrically , and call it a _ pushout along @xmath9 _ , or alternatively a _ pushout along @xmath10_. if either @xmath9 or @xmath10 is a monomorphism , we call it a _ pushout along a monomorphism_.    a category with pullbacks is said to be _ adhesive _ if it has pushouts along monomorphisms , every such pushout is stable under pullback , and in a cube @xmath11 \\ar[dl ] \\ar[dd ] & & b ' \\ar[dl ] \\ar[dd ] \\\\ a ' \\ar[rr ] \\ar[dd ] & & d ' \\ar[dd ] \\\\ & c \\ar[rr ] \\ar[dl ] & & b \\ar[dl ] \\\\ a \\ar[rr ] & & d } \\ ] ] in which the top and bottom squares are pushouts along monomorphisms , and the back and left squares are pullbacks , then the remaining squares are pullbacks .",
    "alternatively , one can combine the stability condition and the other condition into the single requirement that in such a cube , if the bottom square is a pushout along a monomorphism , and the left and back squares are pullbacks , then the top square is a pushout if and only if the front and right squares are pullbacks .",
    "various simple facts follow ; for example the following are both proved in @xcite :    [ prop : basic ] in any adhesive category , the pushout of a monomorphism along any map is a monomorphism , and the resulting square is also a pullback .",
    "suppose that @xmath12 \\ar[dl]_m & & b \\ar[dl]^{n } \\\\ a \\ar[rr ] & & d } \\ ] ] is a pushout in which @xmath13 is a monomorphism .",
    "we have to show that @xmath14 is a monomorphism and that the square is also a pullback .",
    "expand the given square into a cube , as in the diagram @xmath12 \\ar@{=}[dl ] \\ar@{=}[dd ] & & b \\ar@{=}[dl ] \\ar@{=}[dd ] \\\\",
    "c \\ar[rr ] \\ar[dd ] & & b \\ar[dd ] \\\\ & c \\ar[rr ] \\ar[dl ] & & b \\ar[dl ] \\\\ a \\ar[rr ] & & d } \\ ] ] in which the front and bottom faces are both the original square .",
    "the top face is a pushout , the back face a pullback , the left also a pullback ( because @xmath13 is a monomorphism ) , and so the front and right faces are pullbacks .",
    "the front face being a pullback means that the original square is a pullback ; the right face being a pullback means that @xmath14 is a monomorphism .",
    "the proof of the following result is slightly more complicated ; it can be found in @xcite .",
    "[ prop : union ] an adhesive category has binary unions of subobjects , and they are effective .    the claim that the unions are effective means that the union of a pair of subobjects is constructed as the pushout over their intersection .",
    "there is a variant of adhesive categories called quadiadhesive categories , which uses pushouts along regular monomorphisms rather than along all monomorphisms .",
    "perhaps suprisingly , and contrary to what is claimed in @xcite , it is not the case that every quasitopos is quasiadhesive : see @xcite .",
    "an elegant reformulation of the adhesive condition was given in @xcite using the bicategory @xmath15 of spans in @xmath2 .",
    "this bicategory has the same objects as @xmath2 , while a morphism from @xmath4 to @xmath5 is a diagram @xmath16 , with composition given by pullback .",
    "there is an inclusion pseudofunctor @xmath17 sending a morphism @xmath18 to the span from @xmath19 with left leg the identity on @xmath4 and right leg just @xmath9 .",
    "the reformulation then says that a category @xmath2with pullbacks is adhesive if and only if it has pushouts along monomorphisms , and these are sent by the inclusion @xmath17 to _ bicolimits _ in @xmath15 .",
    "a functor between adhesive categories is called adhesive if it preserves pushouts along monomorphisms and pullbacks .",
    "in this section we see that every topos is adhesive , and so every full subcategory of a topos , closed under pushouts along monomorphisms and pullbacks , is adhesive .",
    "then we see the converse : every ( small ) adhesive category has a fully faithful adhesive functor into a topos .    first we give a proof , different to that of @xcite , that every topos is adhesive .",
    "it uses one of the freyd embedding theorems to reduce to the case of a boolean topos .",
    "it is also possible to give direct proofs , but these all seem to be rather longer  see @xcite for one possibility .",
    "recall that a topos is boolean when every subobject is complemented , in the sense that it is a coproduct injection . by a theorem of freyd",
    "@xcite , for every topos @xmath20there is a boolean topos @xmath21and a faithful functor from @xmath20to @xmath21which preserves finite limits and finite ( in fact any ) colimits . since the functor is faithful and preserves finite limits and colimits ,",
    "it also reflects isomorphisms , and so it reflects finite limits and colimits .",
    "thus the adhesive category axioms for @xmath20will follow from those for @xmath21 , and it suffices to prove that any boolean topos is adhesive .    in a boolean topos , any monomorphism @xmath22 is a coproduct injection @xmath23 , and now for any map @xmath24 the corresponding pushout is the square @xmath25_{m } \\ar[r]^{f } & b \\ar[d]^{n } \\\\ c+x \\ar[r]_{f+x } & b+x } \\ ] ] with @xmath26 once again the coproduct injection .    now consider a cube over this square , with back and left faces pullbacks . by extensivity , this has the form @xmath11^{f ' } \\ar[dl]_{m ' } \\ar[dd]^(0.3)c & & b ' \\ar[dl]_{n ' } \\ar[dd]^b \\\\ c'+x ' \\ar[rr]^(0.7){g ' } \\ar[dd]_{c+x } & & d \\ar[dd]^(0.2){d } \\\\ & c \\ar[rr]^(0.7)f \\ar[dl]_m & & b \\ar[dl]^n \\\\ c+x \\ar[rr]_{f+x } & & b+x } \\ ] ] in which @xmath27 is the coproduct injection .    of course if the front and right faces are pullbacks , then the top face is a pushout , by stability of colimits under pullback .",
    "conversely , if the top face is a pushout , then it has the form @xmath28^{f ' } \\ar[d]_{m ' } & b ' \\ar[d]^{n ' } \\\\",
    "c'+x ' \\ar[r]_{f'+x ' } & b'+x ' } \\ ] ] and now @xmath29 is just @xmath30 by commutativity of the front and right faces . the fact that the front and right faces are pullbacks then follows by extensivity .      [ lemma : basic ] let a monomorphism @xmath22 and a map @xmath24 be given in any adhesive category @xmath2 , and construct the diagram @xmath31^{\\gamma } \\ar[d]_m & c_2 \\ar[d]_{m_2 } \\ar@<1ex>[r]^{f_1}\\ar@<-1ex>[r]_{f_2 } & c \\ar[r]^{f } \\ar[d]_m & b \\ar[d]^n \\\\ a \\ar[r]_{\\delta } & a_2 \\ar@<1ex>[r]^{g_1 } \\ar@<-1ex>[r]_{g_2 } & a \\ar[r]_g & d } \\ ] ] in which the right hand square is a pushout , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the kernel pairs of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the diagonal maps . then the left hand square is a pushout and a pullback .    pulling back the right hand square along @xmath36 gives the square @xmath37^{f_1 } \\ar[d]_{m_2 } & c \\ar[d]^{m } \\\\",
    "a_2 \\ar[r]_{g_1 } & a } \\ ] ] which is therefore a pushout .",
    "form the diagram @xmath31^\\gamma \\ar[d]_m & c_2 \\ar[r]^{f_1 } \\ar[d]^j & c \\ar[d]^m \\\\ a \\ar[r]^i \\ar@{.>}[dr]_\\delta & e\\ar[r]^{h_1 } \\ar[d]^k & a \\ar[d]^1 \\\\ & a_2 \\ar[r]_{g_1 } & a } \\ ] ] in which the top left square is a pushout , @xmath38 is the unique morphism satisfying @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the unique morphism satisfying @xmath42 and @xmath43 . by proposition  [ prop : union ] , the morphism @xmath44 is the union of the subobjects @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and so in particular is a monomorphism .",
    "the lemma asserts that it is invertible .",
    "now the top left square and the composite of the upper squares are both pushouts , so the top right square is also a pushout , by the cancellativity properties of pushouts .",
    "the composite of the two squares on the right is the pushout constructed at the beginning of the proof , so finally the lower right square is a pushout by the cancellativity property of pushouts once again .",
    "since @xmath41 is a monomorphism , the lower right square is a pullback by proposition  [ prop : basic ] .",
    "thus @xmath41 is invertible , and our square is indeed a pushout .",
    "it is a pullback by proposition  [ prop : basic ] again along with the fact that @xmath13 is a monomorphism .",
    "let @xmath2be a small adhesive category .",
    "consider the topology generated by all pairs @xmath47 arising as above in a pushout @xmath31^{f } \\ar[d]_{m } & b \\ar[d]^{n } \\\\ a \\ar[r]_{g } & d}\\ ] ] in which @xmath13 is a monomorphism .",
    "the pushout square is also a pullback by proposition  [ prop : basic ] , thus @xmath9 and @xmath13 are determined up to isomorphism by @xmath10 and @xmath14 .",
    "these @xmath47 generate a topology since pushouts along monomorphisms are stable under pullback , thus the category @xmath20of sheaves for the topology is a topos .",
    "we shall show that the yoneda embedding lands in @xmath20 , giving a fully faithful functor @xmath48 , and that @xmath49 is adhesive .    to do this , we need to understand the sheaf condition . consider a pair @xmath47 arising as above .",
    "since @xmath14 is a monomorphism , by proposition  [ prop : basic ] once again , the kernel pair of @xmath14 is just @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath50 be the kernel pair of @xmath10 .",
    "then a functor @xmath51 satisfies the sheaf condition precisely when , for each such @xmath47 , the morphisms @xmath52 and @xmath53 exhibit @xmath54 as the limit of the diagram @xmath55_{ff } \\\\",
    "fa_2 & fa \\ar@<1ex>[l]^{fg_1 } \\ar@<-1ex>[l]_{fg_2 } \\ar[u]^{fm } & fd \\ar[l]_{fg } \\ar[u]_{fn } } \\ ] ] in * set*.    clearly the representables satisfy this condition , so the yoneda embedding lands in @xmath20 , giving a fully faithful functor @xmath48 , which preserves all existing limits , and in particular all finite limits",
    ". we must show that it also preserves pushouts along monomoprhisms .",
    "this is equivalent to the condition that every sheaf @xmath56 sends pushouts along monomorphisms in @xmath57 to limits in * set*. if @xmath10 were monomorphic , so that the kernel pair @xmath33 of @xmath10 were just @xmath4 , this would be immediate , but in general there is a little work to do .",
    "to do this , we use lemma  [ lemma : basic ] .",
    "this tells us that @xmath33 is the pushout of @xmath4 and @xmath32 over @xmath65 , and all maps in this pushout are monomorphisms , so by the sheaf condition @xmath66_{f\\gamma } \\\\",
    "fa \\ar[u]^{fm } & fa_2 \\ar[l]^{f\\delta } \\ar[u]_{fm_2 } } \\ ] ] is a pullback , and so @xmath67 and @xmath68 are jointly monic .",
