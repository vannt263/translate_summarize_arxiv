    ", the voter model has been extensively investigated ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the connection with social phenomena has also motivated efforts to extend the voter model to incorporate various aspects of social reality , such as , among others , stubbornness / contrarianism  @xcite , multiple states  @xcite , internal dissonance  @xcite , individual heterogeneity  @xcite , environmental heterogeneity  @xcite , vacillation  @xcite , and non - linear interactions  @xcite .",
    "these studies have uncovered many new phenomena that are still being actively explored .",
    "our investigation was initially motivated by recent social experiments of centola  @xcite , who studied the spread of a specific behavior in a controlled online network where _ reinforcement _ played a crucial role .",
    "reinforcement means that an individual adopts a particular state only after receiving multiple prompts to adopt this behavior from socially - connected neighbors .",
    "these experiments found that social reinforcement played a decisive role in determining how a new behavior is adopted  @xcite .",
    "previous research that has a connection with this type of reinforcement mechanism include the q - voter model  @xcite , where multiple same - opinion neighbors initiate change , the naming game , and the ab model  @xcite .",
    "an example that is perhaps most closely connected to reinforcement arises in the noise - reduced voter model  @xcite , where a voter keeps a running total of inputs towards changing opinions , but actually changes opinions only when this counter reaches a predefined threshold .",
    "a similar notion of reinforcement arises in a model of fad and innovation dynamics  @xcite and in a model of contagion spread  @xcite .",
    "the use of multiple discrete opinions is not the only option for incorporating varying opinion strength .",
    "previous models have used a continuous range of opinions quantifying the tendency for an agent to change its opinion .",
    "@xcite for example , in the bounded confidence model , an agent can possesses an opinion in a continuous range , with the spatial distance between points representing the difference in those opinions .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we study how reinforcement affects the dynamics of the voter model . in our__confident voter model _ _",
    ", we assume that agents possess some modicum of intrinsic confidence in their beliefs and , unlike the classic voter model , need multiple prompts before changing their opinion state .",
    "we investigate a simple realization of this confident voting in which each opinion state is further demarcated into two substates of different confidence levels .",
    "the basic variables are thus the opinion of each voter and the confidence level with which this opinion is held . for concreteness , we label the two opinion states as plus ( p ) and minus ( m ) .",
    "thus the possible states of an agent are @xmath4 and @xmath5 for confident and unsure plus agents , respectively , and correspondingly @xmath6 and @xmath7 for minus agents ( fig .  [ model ] ) .",
    "the new feature of confident voting is that a confident agent does not change opinion by interacting with an agent of a different opinion .",
    "instead such an agent changes from being confident to being unsure of his opinion . on the other hand , an unsure agent changes opinion by interacting with any agent of the other opinion , as in the classic voter model .",
    "we define two variants of confident voting that accord with common anecdotal experience ( fig .  [ model ] ) . in the _ marginal _ version , an unsure agent",
    "that changes opinion still remains unsure .",
    "such an agent is often labelled a `` flip - flopper '' , a routinely - invoked moniker by american politicians to characterize political opponents .",
    "figuratively , an agent who switches opinion remains ambivalent about the new opinion state and can switch back . in the _ extremal _ version ,",
    "an unsure agent becomes confident after an opinion change .",
    "such an agent `` sees the light '' and therefore becomes fully committed to the new opinion state .",
    "this behavior is typified by paul the apostle , who switched from being dedicated to finding and persecuting early christians to embracing christianity after experiencing a vision of jesus .",
    "the basic variables are the densities of the four types of agents .",
    "we use @xmath8 to denote both the agent types and their densities . in the mean - field description ,",
    "a pair of agents is randomly selected , and the state of one the two agents , chosen equiprobably , changes according to the voter - like dynamics illustrated in fig .",

    "we now outline the time evolution for the two variations of the confident voter model .      for writing the rate equations ,",

    "that is , the interaction between two unsure agents of opposite opinions ( @xmath9 ) leads to no _ net _ density change , as in the classic voter model .",

    "finally , the last line accounts for an unsure agent changing opinion upon interacting with a confident agent of a different opinion .",

    "the rate equation for the total density of plus agents is the same as that for the marginal version , so that again the total density of agents is manifestly conserved .      for both variants of the confident voter model , the time evolution",
