    "new types of violent explosion labelled super - luminous supernovae ( slsne ) have been discovered by the current generation of wide - field optical surveys .",
    "these slsne are 10 to 100 times brighter than normal core - collapse sne ( ccsne ) and reach absolute magnitudes above _ m _ @xmath10 ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "they have attracted considerable attention due to their potential utility as cosmological standard candles ( see * ? ? ? * for the first result on a standardisation ) . however , the mechanism which powers such luminosities is still not well established . some of these slsne show signs of strong interaction between high velocity ejecta from a sn explosion and pre - existing dense circumstellar material . in such cases",
    "prominent lines of hydrogen are seen with multiple velocity components ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the source of the high and long lasting luminosity is almost certainly reprocessing of the kinetic energy of the ejecta during collisions with slower moving shells .",
    "another group of slsne have been called slsne i or slsne ic ( we will use the latter term in this paper ) , since they do not generally exhibit hydrogen or helium lines in their optical spectra , and show no spectral signatures of interaction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the first of these to be discovered was sn  2005ap @xcite which , when linked to the early palomar transient factory ( ptf ) discoveries by @xcite , defined the class of these remarkable explosions .",
    "some physical causes of the luminosity have been proposed .",
    "one is a model of spinning down magnetic neutron stars @xcite and quantitative fits to some of these show good agreement @xcite .",
    "however , there are alternatives and the interaction model for these hydrogen - poor events is still plausible even though there are no obvious spectral signatures @xcite .",
    "a few of these slsne ic have lightcurves that decay quite slowly and the prototype of the class is sn  2007bi .",
    "@xcite proposed that sn  2007bi was the result of a pair - instability supernova ( pisn ) explosion and the slowly fading lightcurve is driven by the decay of a large mass of @xmath11ni in the ejecta .",
    "ptf10mnm is also a probable pisn candidate , and its lightcurve shape and peak luminosity were fitted well with a massive pisn model from .",
    "however , other works e.g. @xcite and @xcite have recently shown that two slsne ic ( ptf12dam and ps1 - 11ap ) have very similar observational characteristics to sn  2007bi , presenting better data before and around peak .",
    "they argue that the detailed lightcurve fits to both the rise time and decay time can not match the models of pair - instability and that @xmath11ni is not the cause of the extreme luminosity . @xcite and @xcite argued that the observational data of both of these slsne ic could be better explained by magnetar powering .",
    "the key point supporting magnetar engines rather than pair - instability explosions , is that the pre - maxima data show a steep rise that is not consistent with pair - instability models , but are well fit by magnetar models with 10 - 16 ejecta .",
    "this suggests that sn  2007bi may also not actually be a pair - instability explosion .",
    "this view was also expressed by the quantitative modelling of @xcite and @xcite who both suggested a magnetar as an alternative power source to a large mass of radioactive @xmath11ni .",
    "another mechanism for boosting the luminosity of normal supernovae is accretion onto compact remnants as recently suggested by @xcite .",
    "all of these alternative models ( magnetars , csm interaction , radioactivity , accretion ) to interpret slsne ic have some success in reproducing the data sets currently available .",
    "due to the relatively low volumetric rate of slsne ic ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the closest events have been found at redshifts between 0.1 and 0.3 , and the observational data sets typically cover the evolution of the sne in the ultraviolet ( uv ) , optical and near - infrared ( nir ) from around 30 days before peak to 100 - 200 days afterwards ( rest - frame ) .",
    "distinguishing between models would benefit from wider wavelength coverage ( e.g. in the x - rays as shown by * ? ? ? * ) or observing sne very late in their evolution .",
    "@xcite showed how the nebular spectrum of sn  2007bi ( at + 470d ) could be used to support a pair - instability interpretation .",
    "@xcite argued that while this was a consistent argument , one could also model the observed line flux with a much lower ejecta mass than that required for pair - instability .",
    "@xcite illustrated the use of deep imaging at late times to set limits on the amount of @xmath11ni explosively produced in slsne .",
    "an upper limit of @xmath11ni mass @xmath12 0.4 was found for sn  2010gx @xcite at 240 - 560d after explosion .",
    "the studies of @xcite and @xcite further attempted to recover the fading stages of slsne ic and fit the luminosity with the magnetar model .",
    "slsne ic appear to have a preference for occurring in faint , dwarf galaxies @xcite , and they also show a trend towards low metallicity environment @xcite .",
    "the most reliable method to quantitatively determine oxygen abundance without calibration uncertainties is the `` direct method '' which requires the electron temperature @xmath13 to be estimated from the auroral [ ] @xmath7 line .",
    "the first detailed study of a slsn ic host ( sn  2010gx ) using the detection of this line @xcite suggested that low metallicity plays a critical role in producing slsne ic .",
    "they found the host of sn  2010gx to have the lowest metallicity of any sn to date ; the oxygen abundance of @xmath14 ( employing the direct @xmath13 method ) is equivalent to 0.05 for a solar value of @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite found the metallicity of the host of ps1 - 10bzj to be @xmath16 ( also using the @xmath13 method with a detection of the weak [ oiii ] 4364 line ) .",
    "this host has the highest specific star - formation rate ( ssfr ) @xmath17 gyr@xmath6 among all slsn ic hosts so far .",
    "the stellar mass of the hosts of slsne ic tend to fall below @xmath18 , hence their ssfr are quite high even for dwarf galaxies in the local universe @xcite .",
    "low metallicity may be a major constraint on the progenitor channel of slsne ic , if it is a common and exclusive feature among the dwarf galaxy hosts . however the auroral [ ] @xmath7 line is often weak and at redshifts between 0.1 and 0.5 is difficult to detect .",
    "spectroscopy with 10m - class telescopes is needed and even then the emission line strengths of the hosts vary considerably such that the detection of this line is not always possible .",
    "the more commonly used metallicity diagnostic is the @xmath19 strong line method , based on the ratio of [ ] @xmath20/. the majority of estimates of metallicity for the sites of slsne ic to date are from measuring the strong nebular line , and the forbidden [ ] /[]lines and applying a calibration such as @xcite ( hereafter m91 ) .",
    "however it has been known for some time that the calibration of the strong line methods vary by nearly an order of magnitude .",
    "typically there are systematic offsets of 0.2 - 0.4 dex ( and sometimes up to 0.6 dex ) between the @xmath19 calibration and abundances determined on an electron temperature scale .",
    "an additional complication for the @xmath19 calibration is that there are two branches of the calibration curve and one needs to know which one to apply .",
    "hence it is desirable , where possible , to measure the strength of the weak [ ] @xmath7 line .",
    "the most extensive study to date of slsn ic hosts is by @xcite who found that 31 hosts are in general low mass ( @xmath21 ) , low - luminosity and low - metallicity ( @xmath22 ) based on @xmath19 method , and have a high median ssfr ( @xmath23 gyr@xmath6 ) .",
    "they suggested the slsn ic host population is similar to long gamma - ray burst ( lgrb ) hosts .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested that , while the host galaxies are similar for slsne ic and lgrbs , slsn hosts are in fact more extreme .",
    "they found that half of their sample of slsn ic hosts are extreme emission line galaxies ( having emission lines with ew @xmath24 100 ) , and claimed that the progenitors of slsne ic are the first generation of stars to explode in a starburst - even younger than grbs .",
    "in contrast , @xcite found that the locations of slsne within their hosts do trace the uv light , and thus are correlated with recent star formation ( massive progenitors ) , but they appear to have less of a preference for occurring in the brightest regions than do lgrbs ( e.g. @xcite ) . hence they suggested that slsn ic progenitors are older / less massive stars than those of lgrbs .",
    "as ptf12dam is one of the closest slsne ic ever found at redshift @xmath0 and this provides an opportunity to study a host galaxy in detail .",
    "this galaxy has exceptionally strong emission lines and with auroral lines of three atomic species available one can determine abundances more precisely than done before . in this paper we present imaging and spectroscopy data at very late epochs in the sn evolution ;",
    "the multi - wavelength lightcurves sample out to 400 days ( rest - frame ) after peak and nebular spectra are presented at @xmath25 500 days .",
    "a major complication with this observational experiment is that slsne ic are usually found in faint , but compact , host galaxies and hence distinguishing between sn flux and galaxy flux requires careful long term monitoring .",
    "the host galaxies and explosion environments are themselves of interest and a study of the late time evolution is necessarily aligned with quantifying the host galaxy contribution .",
    "the requirement to separate host galaxy flux from sn flux necessitates a careful joint analysis of these two flux .",
    "since ptf12dam has a slowly fading lightcurve like sn  2007bi and ps1 - 11ap , we also compared these three sn host galaxies .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section 2 , we detail the photometric follow - up and spectroscopic observations of ptf12dam and its host galaxy .",
    "we also present new photometric data of the host of sn  2007bi .",
    "section 3 discusses the various host galaxy properties , the methods to determinate the host stellar mass , metallicity and star - formation rate , etc .",
    "section 4 investigates the bolometric lightcurve of ptf12dam from @xmath26 to + 399 days .",
    "our discussion on lightcurve modelling is presented in section 5 , and on the host in section 6 .",
    "finally , we conclude in section 7 .",
    "the host of ptf12dam is a clear source detected in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) images ( sdss j142446.21 + 461348.6 ) taken on 2003 february 11 , about 10 years before the explosion of ptf12dam .",
    "while we have gathered deeper and higher resolution images of ptf12dam and its host at @xmath25 2 years after the sn explosion , we used the sdss magnitudes as the most appropriate for the host galaxy since they unambiguously do not contain any supernova light .",
    "we adopted the apparent petrosian ab magnitudes _ u _ = @xmath27 , _ g _",

    "= @xmath32 ( @xmath25 1528  ) and _ nuv _ = @xmath33 ( @xmath25 2271  ) in the ab system ( gr6 catalog ) , which corresponds to the object galex j142446.2 + 461348 .    the host galaxy of ptf12dam is not detected in the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) survey",
    ", its brightness is below the sensitivity limits of _ j _ = 17.0 , _",
    "= 16.0 , _ k _ = 15.5 ( see supplementary information in * ? ? ?",

    "* ) or _ spitzer space telescope _ images .",
    "hence we lack any nir pre - supernova constraints on the host .",
    "however , we obtained deep _",
    "jhk@xmath35 _ images with the 2.6-m nordic optical telescope ( not ) on 2014 february 13 , which was + 554d past peak ( rest - frame ) .",
    "the nir camera on not , notcam , is a @xmath36 pixel array providing a field of view of @xmath37 arcmin with 023 pixels .",
    "those images were reduced by the external iraf / notcam package which applies flatfielding and sky background subtractions .",
    "aperture photometry within the iraf / daophot package was carried out using an aperture of @xmath25 3 , which encompassed the whole galaxy .",
    "we used the same aperture size to measure the flux of two 2mass reference stars in the field to set the zeropoint in each band . to ensure better relative photometry amongst the other epoch measurements , we added three other stars which were detected in the not images as local secondary standards .",
    "this led to derived nir magnitudes of the host of ptf12dam of _ j_@xmath38 , _ h_@xmath39 and _ k@xmath35_=@xmath40 in the vega system .",
    "we assumed that the detected flux in the not nir images is exclusively host galaxy , with negligible contribution from the supernova flux .",
    "as discussed below , the measured _ j_-band flux of ptf12dam ( with image subtraction ) is almost 2 magnitudes fainter than the host at + 342d after peak and at a decline rate of roughly 1 magnitude per 100 days , we would expect it to be @xmath25 4 magnitudes fainter than the measured host flux at this epoch of + 553d ( and even fainter in _ h _ and _ k@xmath41 _ , see table[tab : phot ] )    additionally , as ptf12dam is similar to sn  2007bi @xcite , we have pursued further investigation of the host of sn  2007bi ( sdss j131920.14 + 085543.7 ) .",
    "the sdss detection published in is marginal in _ g _ and _ r _ and there are no flux detections in the other bands .",
    "published estimates of the late time photometry of sn  2007bi and its host galaxy from the eso 8-m very large telescope ( vlt ) and the 2-m liverpool telescope ( lt ) @xcite . however disentangling the host from the sn flux was still not unambiguous .",
    "therefore , we took deep images on the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( wht ) with the auxiliary - port camera ( acam ) instrument on 2012 may 25 .",
    "this camera provides imaging over 8 arcmin ( 025 per pixel ) with a low fringing deep depleted 2k @xmath42 4k eev ccd .",
    "images were taken through the _ griz _ filters on acam , ( specifically filters : 701 slng , 702 slnr , 703 slni , 704 slnz ) .",
    "these were reduced in standard fashion by de - biassing and flat - fielding with twilight sky frames .",
    "zeropoints were determined with 10 sdss reference stars in the field , and aperture photometry was carried out within iraf / daophot using an aperture of @xmath25 2.3to cover the whole galaxy .",
    "we estimated apparent ab magnitudes _",
    "= @xmath43 , _ r _",

    "colour images of each are shown in fig.[fig : host_colour ] .",
    "a large number of spectra of ptf12dam have been presented in @xcite showing the very strong emission line nature of sdss j142446.21 + 461348.6 .",
    "we took additional spectra of ptf12dam since that paper was submitted and the main data we will focus on here for host galaxy analysis was taken on 2013 march 30 .",
    "at this date , the sn was + 265d after peak ( rest - frame ) .",
    "the spectrum was taken with the wht + intermediate dispersion spectrograph and imaging system ( isis ) , listed in table[tab : spectroscopy ] .",
    "the dichroic was removed and the spectra were taken in the red and blue arms separately , since the line at @xmath0 falls almost right on the dichroic cross - over point , leading to uncertain flux calibration . in the red arm ,",
    "the r158r grating was used ( dispersion = 1.8  / pixel ) with an order - blocking filter gg495 and central wavelength of 7500  , giving coverage 5075 - 9170  .",
    "we used a 10 slit to obtain three spectra of 1800 sec exposures each .",
    "the object position was shifted by @xmath25 10 pixels along the slit for each individual frame , allowing us to remove the sky emission lines by two - dimensional image subtraction .",
    "the grating r300b ( dispersion = 0.86  / pixel ) was used for the blue arm with a central wavelength 4500 to cover 3200 - 5985  , and again a 10 slit was used and three 1800 sec exposures taken .",
    "all observations were taken at the parallactic angle . to ensure that the spectra could be corrected for any slit losses",
    ", we took additional spectra with a 100 slit in both red and blue arms for covering the total flux of the galaxy ( fwhm @xmath25 1.5 ) .",
    "the exposure times of these spectra were 600 sec each . in order to calibrate the flux carefully , we took two spectrophotometric standards , hz44 and feige 66 , before and after the host observations , again with both the 10 and 100 slits .",
    "the wavelength calibrations were achieved using daytime cune+cuar arcs .",
    "detrending of the data , such as bias subtraction , and lamp flat - fielding was achieved using standard techniques within iraf .",
    "the combined blue and red spectra provide spectral coverage between 3200 and 9170 (rest - frame 2891 - 8284  ) and the overlap region was used to ensure a uniform flux calibration , employing the three strong lines [ ] @xmath475007 , [ ] @xmath474959 , and .",
    "we measured the line flux in the red and blue arm spectra and applied a linear scaling ( a scaling of 1.39 for red arm ; 1.24 for blue arm ) to bring both the 10 slit spectra into agreement with the 100 slit spectra .",
    "the line flux measured in the separate blue and red arms of these three lines agreed to within @xmath48 after this rescaling .",
    "fig.[fig:12dam_host_spec ] shows the final combined spectrum of the host galaxy .",
    "although the spectrum contains flux from ptf12dam , the strength of the emission lines are secure given their strength and the fact that we subtract off the continuum .",
    "a wealth of emission lines were detected in the host .",
    "these include the auroral [ ] @xmath7 line , which is essential for the most reliable metallicity calibration by estimating the electron temperature of the ionised gas from the flux ratio with [ ] @xmath20 .",
    "the auroral [ ] doublet @xmath497320,7330 was also a strong detection .",
    "the abundance analysis of these spectra is discussed in section[sec : metallicity ] .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     \\(1 ) this work ; ( 2 ) this work and ; ( 3 ) @xcite    we investigated three separate methods to determine the sfr in the host of ptf12dam and show that the sfr from h@xmath50 ( 5.0 @xmath51 ) is different to that from the fuv ( 1.8 @xmath51 ) .",
    "this might not necessarily be physically consistent .",
    "the h@xmath50/h@xmath52 flux ratio could suggest that the photons arising in hii regions suffer from different extinction to continuum fuv photons as traced by the stellar continua of b - type stars .",
    "we also showed that using [ ] luminosity in this type of star - forming galaxy gives a result that is consistent ( 5.2 @xmath51 ) with that from luminosity .",
    "this is useful when working at higher redshifts ( @xmath53 ) when h@xmath50 is shifted to the nir and [ ] @xmath473727 is still accessible in the optical .",
    "the large sfr for ptf12dam is one of the highest measured for a slsn ic hosts @xcite , which is not unexpected given the strength of the emission lines .",
    "when combined with the mass measurement , the ptf12dam host galaxy has a very high specific star - formation rate of ssfr = 17.9 gyr@xmath6 , which is higher than that of field galaxies at the same redshift .",
    "fig.[fig : mass_sfr ] shows a comparison between grb and ccsn hosts , slsn ic and the three 2007bi - like sn hosts that have been published to date .",
    "the host of ptf12dam has a high star - forming activity compared to the hosts of sn  2007bi and ps1 - 11ap .",
    "the stellar masses are quite similar although ps1 - 11ap is more massive .",
    "the ssfr of ptf12dam host is high , 50 times that of ps1 - 11ap s and up to 250 times higher than sn  2007bi s host .",
    "the physical parameters of the hosts of these sn  2007bi - like sne are also listed in table[tab:07bi_like ] .",
    "we recalculated the physical size ( d ) of the ps1 - 11ap host galaxy of @xmath54 kpc using the angular size distance 1255 mpc instead of the luminosity distance ( 2914 mpc ) used in @xcite . for sn",
    "2007bi and ps1 - 11ap we had to use the @xmath19 method since the [ ] @xmath474363 line was not detected .",
    "we adopted the low branch solution since @xmath55([]/ [ ] ) @xmath56 1.2 ( following * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the hosts of ptf12dam , ps1 - 11ap and sn  2007bi span the full range of stellar mass and sfr that other slsne ic occupy .",
    "they are all star - forming dwarf galaxies , with low metallicity and young stellar populations but they do nt appear to be significantly different ( nor self - similar ) in comparison to the other slsne ic .",
    "one should recall that sn  2007bi was initially suggested to be a pair - instability explosion by @xcite and ps1 - 11ap and ptf12dam are extremely similar in their properties .",
    "these three are the only well studied slsne ic which have slowly fading lightcurves and are the only possible pair - instability sne candidates in the local universe with published data .",
    "however we can conclude that their host environments do not show any systematic difference from the bulk of slsne ic .",
    "the lowest metallicity host of any type of supernova to date has been found to be that of sn  2010gx at @xmath14 ( @xmath57 ) on the @xmath13 method scale @xcite .",
    "the host of ptf12dam also follows this low metallicity trend . as discussed by @xcite and @xcite",
    ", it appears that low metallicity is a fundamental requirement to producing slsne ic .",
    "only one out of the @xcite sample has a possible normal , solar like , metallicity ( mls121104 ) but this estimate is based on @xmath19 and the sn is significantly offset from the possible host .",
    "the agglomeration of current evidence is now strongly suggestive that low metallicity , with a critical value of around 8.0dex is required to produce slsne ic , including the fast declining sn  2005ap / sn  2010gx types and the more slowly evolving sn  2007bi / ptf12dam type explosions .",
    "the host galaxies of slsne ic seem to be exclusively compact , low mass , highly star - forming and of low metallicity .",
    "this poses a practical problem for detailed studies of both the host galaxy and late evolution of the supernova .",
    "disentangling the flux of the sn and that of the host requires deep imaging over a period of several years to be sure that uncontaminated host flux is recovered and can be used as a reliable template to recover the faint and fading supernova .",
    "high spatial resolution imaging with hst , as done by @xcite can help resolve the ambiguity . in this paper we demonstrated that it can be done from ground based imaging , even in the case of a relatively bright , marginally resolved host galaxy with the sn occurring in the core .",
    "we demonstrated recovery of the sn flux when it is around 1 - 2% of the host galaxy light .",
    "the data presented here extend the lightcurve of ptf12dam out to + 400d after peak allowing further testing of the three competing models for slsne ic .",
    "the new data points indicate that ptf12dam declines faster than expected from the study of the first 200 days by @xcite .",
    "we find that published pair - instability models can not quantitatively fit full the bolometric lightcurve , as originally suggested in @xcite .",
    "the magnetar model is still viable , but the opacity in the ejecta needs to be lowered to @xmath58 @xmath59g@xmath6 .",
    "this is physically plausible if the high energy radiation that provides the power is dominated by high energy gamma - rays produced via pair - production .",
    "this is an area that should be explored further with more detailed theoretical treatment .",
    "finally , the model of interaction of the ejecta with a dense csm which thermalizes the kinetic energy and powers the bright event fits the full bolometric lightcurve quite well .",
    "however as discussed in @xcite , the configuration of a 13 csm shell ( which is h and he free ) and 29 of ejecta is hard to reconcile with plausible stellar progenitors .",
    "wherever the extra energy comes from to power these types of super - luminous supernovae , the progenitors are almost certainly carbon - oxygen stars in very metal poor galaxies .",
    "we derive a reliable value for the metallicity of the galaxy of @xmath60dex from the direct , electron temperature method ( via detection of the weak [ oiii ] @xmath7 line ) .",
    "this is the fourth measurement of oxygen abundance in a slsn host with this @xmath13 method and all values are between 7.5 - 8.0dex .",
    "this supports the previous suggestions of @xcite and @xcite that low metallicity is a requirement to produce the stellar progenitor systems that give rise to these peculiar sne .",
    "their rarity may be explained by this requirement to be formed at very low metallicity .",

    "<S> the full bolometric lightcurve from @xmath1 to + 399 days ( with respect to peak ) can not be fit satisfactorily with the pair - instability models . an alternative model of interaction with a dense csm </S>",
    "<S> produces a good fit to the data although this requires a very large mass ( @xmath2 ) of hydrogen free csm . </S>",
    "<S> the host galaxy is a compact dwarf ( physical size @xmath3 kpc ) and with @xmath4 , it is the brightest nearby slsn ic host discovered so far . </S>",
    "<S> the host is a low mass system ( @xmath5 ) with a star - formation rate ( 5.0 yr@xmath6 ) , which implies a very high specific star - formation rate ( 17.9 gyr@xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the remarkably strong nebular emission provide detections of the [ ] @xmath7 and [ ] @xmath8 auroral lines and an accurate oxygen abundance of @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we show here that they are at the extreme end of the metallicity distribution of dwarf galaxies and propose that low metallicity is a requirement to produce these rare and peculiar supernovae .    </S>",
