    "collective modes provide important signatures of the physics of bose  einstein condensates , and they have been intensively studied over the past few years . a large number of theoretical calculations , both numerical ( e.g.@xcite@xcite ) and analytical ( e.g.@xcite@xcite ) , have been made based on the standard bogoliubov treatment , and experimental observations @xcite@xcite have confirmed that at very cold temperatures the bogoliubov  de gennes ( bdg ) equations provide a very accurate description of these modes .",
    "this method amounts essentially to specifying eigenmodes for a perturbative , linearized set of equations around a potential formed by the trap and the ground state condensate wave function . in this paper",
    "we use the standard bdg equations to make a systematic study of the shape of elementary modes and the relationship to their energy ordering .",
    "we note that very recent studies have incorporated finite temperature effects in order to improve accuracy at temperatures closer to the critical temperature ( e.g.  see @xcite@xcite and references therein ) , however , for our purposes , the bdg equations provide an appropriate and tractable formalism .    for an isotropic trap",
    ", the spherical symmetry allows a separation into a radial wave function and spherical harmonics , thus much of the behaviour can be predicted from familiar cases in linear quantum mechanics . for axi - symmetric traps , which is the case for most experimental situations , such a separation is not possible , and a variety of techniques have been used to obtain the mode functions . in an elegant paper , fliesser _ et al _ @xcite obtained approximate analytic solutions in the hydrodynamic limit by identifying a non - trivial operator which commutes with both the eigenvalue operator of the bdg equations , and the angular momentum component along the symmetry axis .",
    "hutchinson and zaremba @xcite obtained numerical solutions for the low - lying modes of axially symmetric traps , and studied the behaviour of these modes as the asymmetry of the trap was changed from prolate to oblate .",
    "the latter authors noticed that the lowest lying modes could be grouped into four distinct families , based on the behaviour of the mode frequency as a function of the trap asymmetry .",
    "they also showed by example how some of their modes could be identified with the modes found by fliesser _",
    "et al_.    in this paper , we extend the results of hutchinson and zaremba , and fliesser _ et al _ by obtaining a classification of the modes in terms of their geometrical shapes .",
    "this enables us to give a generalized definition of the mode families ( which are in principle of unlimited number ) .",
    "our classification into families can be expressed in terms of well defined quantum numbers , which can be directly related to the quantum numbers used by fliesser _",
    "et al_. in addition , we have examined the energy ordering of the modes for the case of oblate and prolate traps , and give a simple model that relates the characteristic quasiparticle shapes to their energy ordering .",
    "this also explains the results of hutchinson and zaremba , that all modes in a family have the same frequency dependence on trap anisotropy .",
    "the ground state of a dilute bose ",
    "einstein condensate at low temperatures is well described by the gross  pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) @xmath0 \\psi ( \\bi{r } )      = \\mu \\psi ( \\bi{r } ) ,      \\label{statgpe}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the single - particle hamiltonian of the trap and @xmath2 the number of atoms .",
    "the effective interaction strength @xmath3 is related to the s - wave scattering length @xmath4 and the atomic mass @xmath5 by @xmath6 ( e.g.  see @xcite ) .",
    "the wave function @xmath7 is normalized to unity according to @xmath8 and the eigenvalue @xmath9 is the chemical potential of the condensate .",
    "the quasiparticle excitations on the ground state @xmath10 have amplitudes @xmath11 and @xmath12 determined by the bogoliubov  de gennes ( bdg ) equations @xmath13 where @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "we note that the solutions @xmath11 and @xmath12 of equations ( [ bdg ] ) are not necessarily orthogonal to the ground state , although this is required in a fully quantum mechanical treatment . however , since the orthogonal excitations can readily be obtained from the solutions of equation ( [ bdg ] ) by projection @xcite we will present only the direct solutions of equations ( [ bdg ] ) here .",
    "in this paper we will consider the excitations on an anisotropic ground state of a condensate in a cylindrically symmetric harmonic trap with trapping potential @xmath15,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the anisotropy parameter of the trap .",
    "our numerical solutions for the ground state of the gpe ( [ statgpe ] ) and for the corresponding bdg equations ( [ bdg ] ) are expressed in units of the harmonic oscillator length @xmath17 and energy @xmath18 .",
    "we will illustrate our discussions using the case of @xmath19  hz and non - linearity parameter @xmath20 ( unless otherwise stated ) though we have tested our results for a wide range of @xmath21 values of up to 300000 . because the wave function @xmath12 is in general fairly much a mirror image of @xmath11 , and @xmath22 ( apart from the lowest excitations ) @xcite ,",
    "we present only the wave function @xmath11 .",
    "for isotropic harmonic traps the ground state of the gpe has @xmath23 , and so the gpe is completely separable and reduces to a one - dimensional problem in the radial coordinate @xmath24 the bdg equations ( for excitations on the ground state ) are therefore also spherically symmetric , and thus the total angular momentum and the @xmath25-component of the angular momentum are conserved .",
    "this allows a separation of the angular dependence in the usual fashion by writing the quasiparticle amplitudes as @xmath26 and the equivalent for @xmath27 , where @xmath28 are spherical harmonics . since the radial equation for the excitations does not contain any dependence on @xmath5 , the solutions with the same @xmath29 and different @xmath5 are degenerate .    for cylindrically symmetric harmonic traps",
    "a complete separation of variables is not possible .",
    "although the ordinary schrdinger equation is separable in cartesian or cylindrical coordinates @xcite , this separation is not possible for the gpe due to the non - linear term .",
    "nevertheless , solutions of the form @xmath30 can be found , where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath25 denote the usual cylindrical coordinates .",
    "then , neither the trapping potential nor @xmath33 in the non - linear term of the gpe depend on the azimuthal angle @xmath32 and thus @xmath34 and the operator @xmath35 of the gpe commute , so that @xmath36 is a good quantum number . since no further separation is possible",
    ", the equation must be solved in the two variables @xmath31 and @xmath25 .",
    "the ground state solution of the gpe equation corresponds to @xmath37 .",
    "correspondingly the normal modes of the bdg equations will also have specific angular momentum compositions if @xmath38 is given by ( [ separation ] ) . if @xmath39 is an eigenfunction of @xmath40 with eigenvalue @xmath41",
    ", then @xmath42 will be an eigenfunction with eigenvalue @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "excitations on the ground state ( @xmath37 ) with @xmath44 are degenerate because @xmath5 enters quadratically into the bdg equations in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the axially symmetric trap potential also has a reflection symmetry with respect to the @xmath45-@xmath46 plane , and thus the solutions to the bdg equations can be chosen to have a well - defined parity @xcite . in the isotropic case , where @xmath29 and @xmath5 are good quantum numbers for the excitations , the parity is simply given by @xmath47 .",
    "hutchinson and zaremba showed that , as the trap geometry is altered to an anisotropic one , the degenerate modes split into branches with different excitation frequencies , which emerge continously from the isotropic case ( see figure 1 in reference @xcite ) .",
    "this allowed them to associate a number @xmath29 with each branch depending on where it originates in the isotropic limit , even though total angular momentum is no longer a good quantum number .",
    "in the thomas  fermi limit a complete separation of variables is possible .",
    "stringari @xcite has shown that by casting the gpe into hydrodynamic form and then taking the thomas  fermi limit in the hydrodynamic regime ( i.e.  energies much smaller than the chemical potential ) a second order wave equation can be derived to describe the elementary excitations .",
    "@xcite recognized some underlying symmetries of this equation by identifying three operators which commute with each other , and introduced three corresponding quantum numbers @xmath48 that classify the solutions completely .",
    "an explicit separation of the wave equation was achieved in cylindrical elliptical coordinates @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and in terms of these variables the quantum numbers represent    the thomas  fermi approximation is known to be very accurate as a limiting case of the full solution if @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the harmonic oscillator length . in particular , the shape of the ground state wave function is very well approximated .",
    "although the solutions of the full bdg equations do not strictly conserve these quantum numbers , we find that they exhibit in general the same patterns and symmetries , and we will show , in the appropriate regime , how the family classification scheme we develop in this paper can be related to @xmath54 .",
    "we first consider the isotropic case because then the patterns of the different mode families can be easily described in terms of legendre polynomials . as the trap geometry",
    "is changed from spherical to cylindrical symmetry these patterns are continously modified , being squeezed in the direction of the stronger confinement , but the basic character remains recognizable .    in cylindrical",
    "coordinates the solutions for the excitations in an isotropic trap , @xmath55 , can also be separated as @xmath56 .",
    "the relation @xmath57 between the spherical harmonics @xmath58 and the legendre polynomials @xmath59 shows that @xmath60 is essentially the radial function @xmath61 modulated by the legendre polynomial @xmath59 , where @xmath62 in cylindrical coordinates . in fact , it turns out that the general shape of the families is determined by the symmetries of the legendre polynomials .",
    "we now show that the family classification suggested by hutchinson and zaremba can be generalized , in the isotropic case , as follows .",
    "first we assign a _ principal family number _ which is given by @xmath63 and then an additional number characterizing the radial function is needed to complete the classification into families .",
    "we shall introduce the _",
    "nodal family number",
    "_ @xmath64 for this purpose , which in the isotropic case is simply the number of nodes in the radial function .",
    "the _ family _ is given by the pair ( @xmath65 ) , which together with the magnetic quantum number @xmath5 uniquely specifies any mode . in section [ sec : aniso ] we will show how this family classification generalizes to the anisotropic case .",
    "we illustrate the spatial character of the family assignment by considering first the excitation modes with no radial node ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "we begin with the case @xmath67 , which we illustrate in figure [ fig : families ] with contour plots of full numerical solutions of @xmath68 for the specific case of the degenerate modes of the lowest @xmath69 excitation with @xmath70 .",
    "their principal family numbers are @xmath71 respectively .",
    "the cylindrical symmetry means that the @xmath72-@xmath25 dependence can be found on any plane through the @xmath25-axis    -@xmath25 plane of the quasiparticle amplitude @xmath68 are given for the degenerate modes @xmath69 , ( a ) @xmath73 , ( b ) @xmath74 , ( c ) @xmath75 modes . ]",
    "( we have chosen the @xmath45-@xmath25 plane ) , and the modes are symmetric with respect to the @xmath45-coordinate .",
    "since the radial function is the same for each of these modes , the relative overall shape is determined by the legendre polynomials .",
    "the important property of the legendre polynomials @xmath76 for our purposes is that they have @xmath77 nodes between @xmath78 .",
    "thus , the number of _ angular _ nodal surfaces @xmath79 beween @xmath80 , i.e. surfaces of zero density that are characterized by a constant value of @xmath81 in the isotropic case , determines the principal family number @xmath82 since @xmath82 is given by equation ( [ famnum ] ) as @xmath83 .",
    "we note also that for @xmath67 all legendre polynomials are zero along the @xmath25-axis , but this is not a nodal surface . because the sign of the wave function changes as it crosses a nodal surface , family 1 members have even parity , family 2 have odd parity , and in general the parity of the mode is related to the principal family number by @xmath84 .",
    "the @xmath85 member of each family has a shape that derives from the @xmath86 legendre polynomial .",
    "we call it the _ anomalous _ member of the family , since its shape differs from other members of the family only in that it is non - zero along the symmetry axis , which does not change the character of the excitation significantly .",

    "we stress that all members of the same family , apart from the anomalous one , have the same general shape , i.e.  the same number of peaks ( in the contour plot ) in similar spatial distribution .",
    "the main qualitative difference between modes of the same family is that the peaks move radially outwards and become narrower in both radial and azimuthal direction with increasing eigenfrequency .",

    "they are compressed in the @xmath72-direction and for @xmath109 ( oblate ) they are squeezed in the @xmath25-direction .",
    "this distortion has no effect on the zero line along the symmetry axis , but the nodal surfaces of the isotropic case are distorted .",
    "the radial nodal surfaces are no longer spherical , but are changed to a shape that approximately follows the equipotentials of the trap . in all cases the total number of nodal crossings along the positive half of the axis of strong confinement remains exactly @xmath110 .",
    "the angular nodal surfaces can no longer be parameterized by constant @xmath81 , and they do not meet at the origin : in the prolate case they generally intersect the symmetry axis at various ( non - zero ) values of @xmath25 , while in the oblate case they generally intersect the @xmath111 plane in circles of different radii .",
    "we will call the former _ planar _ nodal surfaces and the latter _ cylindrical _ nodal surfaces , which is a good description in highly anisotropic traps as we will see in section [ sec : bdg ] .",
    "exceptions are rare and occur for the case where the trap is close to spherical .",
    "then , it is possible in the prolate case that adjacent planar nodal surfaces join just before meeting the @xmath25-axis , while in the oblate case it is possible that adjacent cylindrical nodal surfaces join just before the @xmath111 plane .",
    "the nodal crossings of the isotropic case , which are at the centre of four peaks of alternating sign , can also change character in the anisotropic case , as illustrated in the right hand column of figure [ fig : aniso ] ( a ) .",

    "the character of the isotropic excitations remains clearly evident in the anisotropic case , and thus a family assignment can be made .",
    "the first step is to determine the number of radial nodes ( by inspection along the positive part of the axis of strong confinement ) , which gives the radial family number @xmath64 .",
    "next , if there is no radial node ( i.e. @xmath112 ) , we count the number @xmath113 of distinct peaks in a single quadrant ( including peaks that are centered on the axes ) .",
    "if a radial node does exist , we identify the first radial nodal surface , and count the number @xmath113 of distinct peaks in a single quadrant inside this radial nodal surface . in either case , the principal family number is then given by @xmath114 for even modes and @xmath115 for odd modes .",
    "the @xmath116 nodal surface can be traced out by following a path from the initial point on the axis of strong confinement , through successive crossings or anti - crossings , until the axis of weak confinement is reached .",
    "when anti - crossings are encountered , the path continues over the saddle ( along the line of minimum amplitude ) to the nodal line leaving the anti - crossing opposite to the entry . of course this line ( or radial surface )",
    "is no longer strictly nodal , but nevertheless serves to determine a region which is characteristic of the family . just as for the isotropic case , a mode is uniquely identified when the family assignment @xmath117 is given together with the magnetic quantum number @xmath5 , and the parity is given by @xmath84 .",

    "where the treatment of fliesser _ _ et al__@xcite is valid , we can relate their quantum numbers @xmath149 , @xmath150 to our family assignment numbers @xmath82 and @xmath64 as follows : @xmath151    the similarity of shape of modes of the same family explains the similarity of frequency dependence on anisotropy for modes in a given family found by hutchinson and zaremba ; changes in trap geometry affect every mode in the family in much the same way .",
    "we have also shown how the energy ordering of the quasiparticle excitations is related to their family shape and provided a simple model that explains the behaviour in terms of harmonic oscillator eigenstates .",
