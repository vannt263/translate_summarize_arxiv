    "periodic darboux chains generate finite - gap systems @xcite in an alternative way to the original algebro - geometric approach @xcite .",
    "such chains generate also the quantum harmonic oscillator ( qho ) system and painlev equations @xcite , which are intimately related with isomonodromic deformations of linear systems and integrability properties of nonlinear systems in partial derivatives .",
    "recently , the isomonodromic deformations @xcite and darboux transformations played a key role in the discovery and investigation of the properties of the new class of exceptional orthogonal polynomials @xcite .",

    "@xcite can be obtained from the qho system by applying to it darboux transformation generated by the  wick - rotated \" second excitation of the ground - state .",
    "the resulting system is characterized by an infinite tower of equidistant bound states which are separated from the ground - state by a triple energy gap . as a consequence ,",

    "it is known that the spectrum of the qho carries an infinite - dimensional irreducible representation of the bosonized @xmath1 superalgebra which can be generated by means of the creation and annihilation operators identified as fermionic generators @xcite  . in this context",
    "there appears a rather natural question : what are the ladder operators in rationally extended quantum harmonic oscillator systems and what spectrum generating algebras do they produce ?",
    "in this paper we answer these questions for the simplest case of the reqho system by employing the properties of the darboux transformations . a special role in the construction",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we review general properties of the darboux transformations and related jordan states . in section 3",
    "we discuss discrete flows generated by the ladder operators in the qho system and recall the bosonized superconformal @xmath1 structure appearing in it in the form of the spectrum generating superalgebra . in section 4",
    "we generate the simplest reqho by applying darboux transformation to the qho",
    ". then we construct ladder operators for reqho by a darboux - dressing of the creation and annihilation operators of the qho system , consider discrete flows and discuss a polynomially deformed bosonized @xmath1 structure in the reqho that reflects in a coherent way peculiarities of its spectrum .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the conclusion and outlook . in appendix",

    "the quadratic casimir ( [ ospcas ] ) of the lie superalgebra @xmath1 generated by the rescaled operators @xmath256 , @xmath257 and @xmath249 is nothing else as the rescaled and shifted for additive constant central element @xmath258 , @xmath259 . for the reqho system operators @xmath256 correspond to the ladder operators @xmath238 , and we have @xmath260 , @xmath261 with @xmath174 defined in ( [ a+a - h ] ) . the superalgebra ( [ osp+!])([so(2,1 ) ! ! ] ) in this case can be considered as a polynomial deformation of the @xmath1 superalgebra . using relations ( [ a+a - h ] ) and ( [ aaadd3 ] )",
    ", one can easily check that the central element @xmath258 reduces here identically to zero .",
    "to conclude , we list some problems to be interesting for further investigation .    we have constructed ladder operators for the simplest version of the reqho system by the darboux - dressing of creation and annihilation operators of the qho .",
    "this was done by means of the first order differential operators @xmath148 and @xmath164 which intertwine the reqho and qho hamiltonians and factorize both of them .",
    "the applied procedure here is analogous to the procedure by which nontrivial lax - novikov integrals for reflectionless quantum systems are constructed by the darboux - dressing of the free particle s momentum operator @xcite .",
    "but the same reqho system can also be constructed by means of the darboux - crum - krein - adler procedure based on the usage of several eigenstates of the qho .",
    "in such a case the intertwiners will be higher order differential operators .",
    "one can expect that the existence of different darboux and darboux - crum - krein - adler transformations should reveal some new interesting aspects in the construction of the ladder operators for the reqho and related dynamical symmetries ( spectrum generating algebras ) .",
    "there exist other rational extensions of the qho system .",
    "first , the analogs of the reqho considered here can be generated by taking non - physical nodeless eigenstate @xmath262 with @xmath263 as a function @xmath147 to generate darboux transformations .",
    "the ladder operators for such systems can be constructed in a similar way , by the darboux - dressing of the ladder operators of the qho .",
    "we can generate also then a corresponding polynomially deformed bosonized @xmath1 superalgebra , whose trivial and infinite - dimensional representations will be realized on physical states of the corresponding rationally extended quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "it is interesting if there will be any essential difference in the structure of the discrete flows generated by the ladder operators in such systems in comparison with the reqho system considered here .",
    "the construction of the ladder operators by taking into account the existence of different darboux - crum - krein - adler transformations to generate such systems should also reveal a dependence on the order of the polynomial that presents in the structure of the generating function @xmath264 and on a size of the gap between the isolated ground - state and the infinite tower of equidistant bound states .",
    "a more complicated and a more rich picture from the point of view of the ladder operators and related symmetries can be expected in rationally extended quantum harmonic oscillator systems with number @xmath265 of isolated bound states in the spectrum . there , a priori two essentially different cases should be distinguished .",
    "one case is when @xmath265 bound states will be separated from the infinite tower of equidistant bound states without any additional gaps between those @xmath266 states .",
    "another , more general case is when isolated states include some additional gaps between themselves .",
    "it is known that jordan states appear in confluent darboux - crum transformations @xcite .",
    "they , particularly , were employed recently for the design of the pt - symmetric optical systems with invisible periodicity defects as well as completely invisible reflectionless pt - symmetric systems @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to look for possible physical applications of the generalized jordan states considered here .",
    "the considered reqho system as well as its generalizations seem also to be interesting from the point of view of possible physical applications since unlike other known deformations of the qho , e.g. related to the minimal length uncertainty relation @xcite , they provide a very specific change of the spectrum .",
    "namely , they add effectively a finite number of bound states in the lower part of the qho spectrum , separated by an additional ( _ adjustable _ ) gap , without disturbing the equidistant character of the rest of the infinite tower of the discrete levels . in this aspect",
    "they are very similar , as it has been noted above in another but related context , to the quantum reflectionless systems which add a finite number of discrete bound states into the spectrum of the free particle .",
    "such reflectionless systems are directly related to the soliton solutions to the korteweg - de vries and modified kortweg - de vries equations , and find a lot of interesting applications in very diverse areas of physics including qcd , cosmology , solid states physics , the physics of polymers , plasma physics , and quantum optics , just to mention a few .",

    "<S> ladder operators for the simplest version of a rationally extended quantum harmonic oscillator ( reqho ) are constructed by applying a darboux transformation to the quantum harmonic oscillator system . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the physical spectrum of the reqho carries a direct sum of a trivial and an infinite - dimensional irreducible representation of the polynomially deformed bosonized @xmath0 superalgebra . in correspondence with this </S>",
    "<S> the ground state of the system is isolated from other physical states but can be reached by ladder operators via non - physical energy eigenstates , which belong to either an infinite chain of similar eigenstates or to the chains with generalized jordan states . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the discrete chains of the states generated by ladder operators and associated with physical energy levels include six basic generalized jordan states , in comparison with the two basic jordan states entering in analogous discrete chains for the quantum harmonic oscillator .    </S>",
