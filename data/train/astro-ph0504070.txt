    "one of the recent exiting discoveries in gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) is the break detected in the afterglow light curve of some bursts which could be interpreted as a consequence of the beamed emission ( e.g. , ref .",
    "if the afterglow emission is beamed , how is the prompt emission ?",
    "whether the latter emission is isotropic or strongly beamed in our direction has been an open question for some years . as mentioned in ref . , this question has implications on almost every aspect of the phenomenon , from the energetics of the events to the engineering of the inner engine and the statistics and the luminosity function of the sources .",
    "frail et al .",
    "( 2001 ) studied@xcite a sample of grbs with good afterglow follow - up and known redshifts .",
    "they interpreted the breaks in the scenario of the beamed model and found that most bursts with large values of the isotropic - equivalent gamma - ray energy , @xmath4 , possess the smallest beaming fraction , @xmath5 .",
    "the collimation - corrected energy , @xmath6 , of this sample is strongly clustered .",
    "this was independently confirmed by panaitescu & kumar ( 2001)@xcite .",
    "bloom et al.(2003 ) collected a larger sample of grbs and found that the distribution of @xmath7 clusters around @xmath8 ergs@xcite .",
    "all these were regarded as evidence supporting the beamed emission scenario .",
    "the isotropic gamma - ray energy @xmath4 was found to be correlated with the cosmological co - moving frame peak energy @xmath9 by different authors ( see , e.g. , refs .   ) .",
    "more recently , ghirlanda et al . (",
    "2004 ) found@xcite a tight correlation between @xmath10 and @xmath9 , which sheds light on the still uncertain radiation processes for the prompt grb emission . in computing @xmath10 ,",
    "it is essential that the beaming fraction is available . according to refs .",
    ", the opening angle of the jet can be calculated with @xmath11 in the case of a homogeneous circumburst medium , where @xmath12 is a constant which can be found in ref .  , @xmath13 is the afterglow jet break time , @xmath14 is the redshift , @xmath15 is the efficiency for converting the explosion energy to radiation , @xmath16 is the density of the ambient medium , and @xmath4 is the energy in @xmath17-rays calculated assuming that the emission is isotropic .",
    "this enables us to estimate the opening angle of jets and with it to peep into other parameters associated with the mechanism of radiation .",
    "indeed , under the scenario of jets , parameters such as the total energy in the relativistic ejecta , the jet opening angle , the density and profile of the medium in the immediate vicinity of the burst , and those associated with the microphysical shocks could be estimated by modeling the broadband emission of grb afterglows for various bursts ( see refs .  ,",
    "assuming that the observed grb durations are a good measure of the ejecta deceleration timescale , the jet lorentz factors at the deceleration radius were found to be within 70 and 300 for 10 grbs@xcite .",
    "in addition to the break time observed in the afterglow , sari & piran ( 1999 ) suggested@xcite that the reverse shock of a burst could provide a crude measurement of the initial lorentz factor . in the case of grb 990123 , they showed that the initial lorentz factor @xmath18 could be obtained from the prompt optical flash observed in the burst .",
    "early afterglow which could overlap the main burst was predicted previously ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) . according to the analysis of ref .",
    "based on the internal - external shocks model , for short bursts the peak of the afterglow will be delayed , typically , by few dozens of seconds after the burst while for long ones the early afterglow emission will overlap the grb signal , and a delayed emission , with the characteristics of the early afterglow , can be used to measure the initial lorentz factor of the relativistic flow ( see , also refs .   ) .    hinted by the previous works ,",
    "we wonder if the initial lorentz factor could be estimated with an independent approach in case the delayed emission is not available .",
    "an investigation on this issue is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we present appropriate formulas and show how to estimate the concerned parameters with them . a new grb sample for which the redshift and the break time in the afterglow are known is studied in section 3 .",
    "conclusions are summarized in the last section , where a brief discussion is present .",
    "as the initial explosion of grbs is not at all in the stage of afterglow , we can not estimate parameters of the former from the measurements of the latter according to the law of the afterglow . to connect the two phases , we need to find a particular moment which satisfies the following requirements : a ) at that moment , the afterglow has already begun so that the law of the afterglow is applicable ;",
    "b ) parameters associated with that moment are well related with those of the initial explosion .",
    "as predicted above , for long bursts the early afterglow emission will overlap the grb signal .",
    "indeed , it was reported recently that a bright optical emission from grb 990123 was detected while the burst was still in progress@xcite .",
    "revealed in ref .",
    "is the discovery of the optical counterpart of grb 021004 only 193 seconds after the event .",
    "the time ( measured from the trigger ) is slightly longer than the duration of the event .",
    "li et al . ( 2003 ) showed@xcite that the faintness of grb 021211 , coupled with the fast decline typical of optical afterglows , suggests that some of the dark bursts were not detected because optical observations commenced too late after the grb .",
    "accordingly , we assume that to the time the prompt emission of grbs is going to be undetectable , which is generally represented by the concept of duration @xmath19 ( in batse , it is associated with @xmath20 ) , the afterglow of the source has already emerged . under this assumption",
    ", @xmath19 is the moment that can satisfy the first requirement .",
    "shown in the following one will find that @xmath19 can also satisfy the second requirement .",
    "in addition , @xmath19 is fortunately always available .",
    "the observed complex structure of grb  light curves suggests that , during the prompt emission of a burst , several ejecta with different masses and different lorentz factors might be involved .",
    "we assume that , after the process of the prompt emission , all ejecta are merged as a single one which has mass @xmath21 and bears a lorentz factor @xmath22 ( which is measured at the end of the duration of the burst ) .",
    "let s define an average initial lorentz factor of the early phase ejecta as@xmath23with@xmath24where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the initial lorentz factor and the mass of the @xmath27th ejecta , respectively .",
    "one can check that , for a burst associated with a shock produced by the collision of two shells with roughly equal masses , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the lorentz factors of the inner and outer shells , respectively , while for a burst containing several shells with roughly equal masses , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the number of shells .",
    "note that the initial kinetic energy of all these early phase ejecta is the product of the explosion of the burst ( where a number of sub - explosions might be involved ) .",
    "it is well known that it is the losing of the kinetic energy of the grb ejecta that gives rise to the energy of the radiation observed during the prompt emission as well as the increasing of the thermal energy during this period , regardless what the radiation mechanism is .",
    "according to the conservation of energy , one finds @xmath33where @xmath34 is the increasing of the thermal energy of the system . assuming that the radiation is associated with the synchrotron mechanism , as is generally believed , then parts of the increasing thermal energy at any moment must be converted to radiation due to the increasing velocity of individual electrons .",
    "based on this argument , we believe that , as a sum of that of all moments , @xmath34 would be significantly reduced , compared with that obtained in the situation where the synchrotron mechanism is not at work .",
    "we accordingly assume that , during the shock , the increasing thermal energy is much smaller than the radiation energy .",
    "that is , we assume @xmath35 . omitting the increasing of the thermal energy , we get from ( 4 ) that @xmath36when all the initial kinetic energy is converted to photons , we have @xmath37 and then @xmath38 , and when none of the initial kinetic energy is changed to radiation , we get @xmath39 and then @xmath40 . thus , one always finds @xmath41 . according to ( 5 ) , the initial lorentz factor could be determined as long as @xmath42 and @xmath15 ( when @xmath43 ) are known .    during the period of the afterglow ,",
    "when the external matter is homogenously distributed , the lorentz factor would decline following the law of @xmath44 , where @xmath45 in a radiative phase and @xmath46 in an adiabatic phase ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "thus , we get @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the lorentz factor of the ejecta measured at @xmath13 . according to the beamed model , a break in the afterglow light curve of the burst",
    "would appear when its bulk lorentz factor becomes of the order of @xmath49 , i.e. , @xmath50 .",
    "we then come to @xmath51for @xmath52 , we get from equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) that @xmath53    as is generally assumed , the jet of bursts is strongly beamed in our direction so that the emission is detectable due to the great doppler boosting ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) . according to the doppler effect",
    ", a photon of @xmath54 emitted from the area of @xmath55 within the spherical surface of a uniform jet which moves outwards with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath56 would be blue - shifted to @xmath57 . in the case of photons being emitted from a certain area with a rest frame band function spectrum@xcite which peaks at @xmath58 , the spectrum would be blue - shifted and would peak at @xmath9 which is proportional to @xmath58 ( see table 4 in ref .   where @xmath59 can be concluded ) .",
    "neglecting the minute difference we take in the following that @xmath60 .",
    "following ref .  , we consider through out this paper only an adiabatic phase and then take @xmath46 .",
    "thus , from equation ( 7 ) we get @xmath61and @xmath62",
    "presented in ref .",
    "are 52 grb or xrf sources ( called the fb sample ) where their redshifts as well as the gamma - ray fluences are available .",
    "the isotropic energies @xmath4 were calculated assuming a standard cosmology of @xmath63 .",
    "for some of these sources , break times @xmath13 are available , and then with equation ( 1 ) the opening angles @xmath64 of the sources could be well determined , where @xmath65 is assumed ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "according to equations ( 8) and ( 9 ) , to calculate @xmath66 and @xmath58 for these sources we need to know @xmath19 as well .",
    "listed in table 1 are the values of @xmath19 , which is measured in various bands , for the sources of the fb sample with @xmath13 , @xmath64 , and @xmath9 available . to meet the requirement that the afterglow has already begun ( i.e. , @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the start time of the afterglow ) and the prompt emission",
    "is just ended so that the common value of the efficiency @xmath15 can be adopted and the mass of the piled up ambient medium is relatively small , we adopt the largest value of @xmath19 to calculate @xmath66 and @xmath58 .",
    "the results are presented in table 2 .    shown in fig .",
    "1 is the relation between @xmath58 and @xmath69 .",
    "it shows clearly that @xmath70 and @xmath71 are not correlated at all . the un - correlation between the two quantities seems to suggest that the rest frame peak energy is strongly associated with the mechanism rather than with the expansion speed ( one will find in the following that the distribution of @xmath66 is much more clustered than that of @xmath58 ) .     and @xmath66 .",
    "the correlation coefficient between @xmath70 and @xmath71 is @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) and the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis is 0.734,width=288 ]    displayed in fig .",
    "2 are the distributions of @xmath58 and @xmath69",
    ". the rest frame peak energy peaks at @xmath74 and is mainly distributed within @xmath3 .",
    "the lorentz factor peaks at @xmath0 and it is found mainly within @xmath1 , which is very narrow .    as fig .",
    "3 shows , there is a very tight correlation between @xmath58 and @xmath75 : @xmath76 .",
    "note that , relation @xmath77 itself could not guarantee the correlation , since if it did , it should also lead to a correlation between @xmath78 and @xmath66 , but this is not true ( see fig .",
    "the correlation between @xmath79 and @xmath80 must arise from mechanisms other than from the doppler effect .     and @xmath58 .",
    "the correlation coefficient between @xmath81 and @xmath70 is @xmath82 ( @xmath73 ) and the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis is @xmath83.,width=288 ]",
    "in this paper we propose a method which does not refer to the delayed emission of the early afterglow to estimate the initial lorentz factor of grbs , in case the detection of the early afterglows of many bursts might be missed . due to the fact that the afterglows of some bursts were observed soon after the detection of the main emission , we assume that the afterglows of the bursts concerned occur",
    "well before the prompt emission dies away ( i.e. , we assume @xmath84 ) . under this assumption , the bulk lorentz factor of a burst measured at the break time , @xmath13 , and that measured at the time marking the end of duration , @xmath19 , could be well related by the law of @xmath85 according to the beaming scenario . employing the concept of the efficiency for converting the explosion energy to radiation , @xmath15",
    ", we can relate the initial lorentz factor of a burst to that measured at @xmath19 . combining the two relations one can therefore estimate the initial lorentz factor of a burst from that measured at @xmath13 .",
    "the corresponding rest frame peak energy can hence be estimated from this initial lorentz factor and the observed peak energy according to the doppler effect .    applying this method , the initial lorentz factors of the bulk motion as well as the corresponding rest frame spectral peak energies of grbs for a new sample for which the redshift and the break time in the afterglows are available",
    "are estimated .",
    "the sample employed is that presented currently by ref .  .",
    "our analysis shows that the initial lorentz factor @xmath86 peaks at @xmath0 and is distributed mainly within @xmath1 , and the peak of the distribution of the corresponding rest frame peak energy is @xmath87 and its main region is @xmath3 .",
    "it is known that , a large value of the lorentz factor , @xmath88 , is essential to overcome the compactness problem ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) . as individual cases , the optical flash accompanying grb 990123 provids a direct evidence for a large lorentz factor@xcite @xmath18",
    "statistically , mallozzi et al . (",
    "1995 ) found@xcite that the average value of @xmath80 for 82 bright bursts is @xmath89 .",
    "taking @xmath74 and adopting @xmath77 , we find that the average lorentz factor of these bursts would be @xmath90 , which is consistent with what we obtained above .",
    "preece et al .",
    "( 2000 ) revealed@xcite by the analysis of high time resolution spectroscopy of 156 bright bursts that the main range of @xmath80 for these sources could be found to be within @xmath91kev$ ] .",
    "this would lead to a range of @xmath92 $ ] when adopting @xmath74 and @xmath77 , which is also in agreement with what we find in this paper .    as shown in table 2 ,",
    "the estimated initial lorentz factor for grb 990123 is @xmath93 which is slightly larger than what is obtained with the method referring to the delayed emission of the early afterglow ( see ref .  , where @xmath18 was presented ) . applying ( 6 ) ,",
    "we get @xmath94 for this source .",
    "we argue that the initial lorentz factor estimated with our method is that associated with the initial explosion of a burst .",
    "it is natural that this value is larger than others which are measured at later times",
    ". this might be the cause for the detected difference .",
    "ignoring this slight difference , our method is consistent with that referring to the delayed emission of the early afterglow .",
    "we suspect that , a very strong shock might produce higher energy photons , which is characterized by a large value of @xmath58 , and this would lead to a large value of @xmath80 ( note that , as shown above , the lorentz factor does not change much for different sources ) .",
    "we make a statistical analysis for @xmath7 and @xmath58 and find that they are indeed obviously correlated ( the figure is omitted ) .",
    "we then understand why @xmath95 is correlated with @xmath80 .",
    "it is because that strong shocks produce large values of both @xmath7 and @xmath80 , whereas weak shocks lead to smaller values .",
    "we assume through out this paper that the afterglow is dominated by an adiabatic process .",
    "however , there is an alternative which is a radiative process , for which , @xmath45 should be adopted .",
    "we repeat our work by replacing @xmath46 with @xmath45 .",
    "we find that , the value of @xmath66 is mainly distributed within @xmath96 which is slightly larger than what we expect .",
    "thus , we tend to believe that , during the epoch of the afterglow , the dominated process is adiabatic rather than radiative ( this is not certain since the resulted lorentz factors are still within the acceptable range ) .    in the above analysis , we assume that @xmath35",
    ". does our analysis strongly depend on this assumption ? to find an answer to this , let us assign @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is a constant . in this way ,",
    "equation ( 4 ) becomes @xmath99 taking @xmath100 , we get @xmath101 according to ( 10 ) , @xmath102 suggests that all the explosion energy converts to radiation , which would not be true .",
    "thus , we have @xmath103 . in this case",
    ", one finds that formulas ( 5 ) , ( 7 ) , ( 8) and ( 9 ) are valid when one replaces @xmath104 with @xmath105 .",
    "this indicates that the above analysis does not depend on the the mentioned assumption . when the two amounts of energy are comparable , i.e. , @xmath106 , one has @xmath107 . adopting @xmath108 leads to @xmath109 , which would not significantly change the results obtained above .",
