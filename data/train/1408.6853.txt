    "the role of nonlinear localized coherent phenomena for the formation of anomalous structures in crystalline materials remains unclear , despite a number of efforts over the last two decades . in this article , we begin with a short survey of the state of the art in research on this topic .",
    "this serves to introduce a number of relevant issues in relation to atomistic models , including the work of marn et al . on breathers @xcite in the k layer in mica .    from a heavily simplified perspective",
    ", there are three types of localized excitations in dispersive nonlinear systems .",
    "these are ( in 1d ) solitons , kinks , and breathers , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : soliton ] .    * * soliton*. strongly localized package ( lump ) of energy , can move large distances with no distortion , very stable even under collisions or perturbations . * * kink*. similar to a soliton , but with different boundary conditions as @xmath1 . may be even more stable due to topological conservation laws . * * breather*. a more complicated form of nonlinear wave .",
    "it looks like a soliton modulated by an internal carrier wave .",
    "not common in continuous systems but more frequently seen in discrete systems .",
    "note that breathers are also known as _ intrinsic localized modes _ ( ilms ) .",
    "m. russell s _ quodon _ discussed in this article is now believed to be a breather .",
    "breathers in discrete systems were first studied by ovchinnikov @xcite , but this pioneering paper was overlooked for many years .",
    "ovchinnikov also considered the mobility of such objects .    independently in the early 80s , breathers were studied in the discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation .",
    "@xmath2 where @xmath3 is the _ complex _ oscillator amplitude at the @xmath4th lattice site .",
    "an early application of the dnls equation was as a simple model for so - called davydov solitons on a protein molecule .",
    "arguably the first paper on the single breather in the system was due to scott and macneil @xcite ( although such states were still called solitons in the early papers ) .",
    "[ fig : dnls ] shows a stationary breather on the dnls lattice .",
    "the time dependence in the dnls model for _ stationary _ solutions is extremely simple : @xmath5 .",
    "the amplitude goes to zero exponentially as @xmath6 .",
    "eilbeck , lomdahl and scott took the first tentative step towards a 2d theory of breathers in the dnls model by considering two _ coupled _ chains in a study of a crystal called acetanilide ( acn ) which modelled protein structure @xcite .",
    "this work found examples of staggered breathers ( i.e.  breather energies spread over two or more sites ) and the use of path - following from what is now called the anti - continuum limit .",
    "they also considered more complex non - chain geometries , finding many exact solutions on small graphs @xcite .",
    "in the course of work in this area , a relatively long - lived example of a moving breathers in a 1d discrete systems was found @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : mov_bre ] .",
    "many workers found other examples of discrete breathers in various systems ( see @xcite for reviews ) . in 1994 , mackay and aubry found a general mathematical proof for the existence of _ stationary _ breathers in a quite general class of systems @xcite .",
    "for _ mobile _ breathers in the dnls equation , feddersen found a very accurate numerical description of travelling wave solutions in 1991 @xcite .",
    "the study of kinks in continuum and discrete models is a large subject in its own right .",
    "a good early paper by peyrard and kruskal @xcite , on kinks in a highly discrete sine - gordon model , is a nice introduction .",
    "some results on the numerical studies of solitons in discrete systems will be found in @xcite .",
    "it is not difficult to generalise soliton or kink equations to give models which have _ plane wave _ solutions in 2d , see fig.[fig : solkink2d ] .",
    "however there is a problem - the wave front has a finite energy density so the infinite wave front has infinite energy .",
    "what we need is a _ localized _ pulse with finite energy .",
    "schematically we can envisage pulses such as that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : loc ] .",
    "the soliton looks reasonable , but for topological reasons the kink has an infinite `` side wall '' dislocation which may lead to infinite energy .",
    "the tail can be truncated  but this brings us back to a soliton - type wave .",
    "the challenge then is to develop a suitable model for a kink or soliton solution in a 2d system , or failing that to find breather solutions .      in a simple single component homogeneous scalar * continuum * field theory",
    ", we have a * non - existence * proof for stationary solitons due to derrick ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the simple idea is to start by supposing that , for example , our @xmath7-dimensional hamiltonian is @xmath8 consider scaling the spatial variable @xmath9 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath10 if the soliton solution @xmath11 is a stable minima , then @xmath12 .",
    "the solution for @xmath13 is @xmath14 , but there is * no solution * for @xmath15 .",
    "note that the theorem does not apply when we have a discrete system which does not have a continuum limit - here breathers / ilms / quodons may play a part .",
    "the theorem ( and the arguments given following the figures above ) give an indication that problems may arise if we try to generalise in a naive way from 1d to higher dimensions .",

    "we give three atoms in the centre an asymmetric kick , to mimic the radioactive decay of a k atom in the mica . at @xmath30",
    "the breather resulting from this kick has moved to the edge of the small lattice and is beginning to reappear on the opposite side due to the imposed periodic boundary conditions . at @xmath31",
    "it has continued in the same direction and has almost reached the starting point .",
    "the final frame is at a much later time , @xmath32 , and shows the breather after it has traversed the lattice about ten times .",
    "marn s study showed stable breathers propagating up to around @xmath33 @xmath34 lattice constants before breaking up .",
    "this is encouraging , but to demonstrate tracks in mica of centimetres , we need an extra factor of @xmath35 in the lifetime . marn s",
    "2d calculation also included a brief study of inline breather - breather collisions @xcite .",
    "most simulations were performed on a 16x16 lattice due to cpu speeds at the time , but a few were done using 32x32 lattices .",
    "the k atoms were constrained to stay within the unit cell  with no hopping to other sites ( hence no kinks ) .",
    "all simulations were carried out at zero temperature .",
    "similar results were also observed for cubic lattices @xcite .",
    "a key feature in the model is that the forces have the so - called quasi - one - dimensional property  that is , if an atom is moved along one of the crystallographic directions , the restoring forces is exactly in the same line , but with a negative sign .",
    "technically this is a @xmath36 symmetry .",
    "note that we also use `` quasi - one - dimensional '' in a different sense , to describe the fact that a localized breather or kink is observed travelling along a crystallographic direction with very little disturbance in a transverse direction .",
    "the two concepts are conjectured to be closely related , although no formal proof of this exists .",
    "in the main part of this section , we describe a new 2d mathematical model used for the present study of long - lived propagating breather and kink solutions in mica at 0@xmath0k . with this model",
    "we allow atoms in the lattice to be displaced out of the unit cells compared to the nearest neighbour interactions considered in marn s model from sect .",
    "[ sec : marinsim ] .",
    "thus we can now allow the possibility of kink solutions in our 2d lattice model .",
    "in addition , in the choice of potentials we take a more academic point of view and explore alternative approaches besides lennard - jones .",
    "current research raises new and not yet fully understood questions , and motivates further , more intensive study .    in the present work we are concerned with the hamiltonian dynamics of @xmath37 potassium atoms @xmath16 in a 2d @xmath16-@xmath16 sheet of mica crystal lattice .",
    "equivalently to ( [ eq : mham ] ) the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the 2d position vector of @xmath40 @xmath16 atom in @xmath41 coordinates , @xmath42 is momentum , @xmath43 is kinetic energy , @xmath18 is the interaction potential energy and @xmath44 is the on - site potential energy .",

    "the detailed structure of these potential energy functions may strongly influence the behaviour observed in simulations , particularly dynamical properties .",
    "all potentials mentioned above are built from completely monotone functions with a possible singularity at vanishing interparticle distance .",

    "a valuable feature of symplectic integrators is that they may , under certain circumstances , be interpreted as being essentially equivalent to the exact propagation of a modified hamiltonian ( @xmath86 ) ( for a @xmath87 order scheme ) meaning that we may reinterpret the trajectories generated by our numerical method as dynamical paths for a perturbed system .",
