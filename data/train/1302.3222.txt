    ", @xmath80 always holds ; we have used this to arrive at eq . .",
    "with the scattering amplitude per unit time , we may insert it into the generic form of the boltzmann equation for the scattering of bosons ( see , for example , chapter 5 of @xcite ) , @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the number of photon scatterings off the cosmic string in question , per unit time , per unit momentum space ; and @xmath83 is the number of background photons per unit volume per unit momentum space .",

    "since every product of the @xmath89s and @xmath91s contains even powers of @xmath54 , the minus sign can be dropped ; hence , the swap @xmath44 amounts to the replacements @xmath94 in every term of @xmath86 .",
    "the conclusion then follows if we observe that , the terms in @xmath86 are either real or comes in pairs whose sum is real .",
    "this invariance @xmath95 means the quadratic - in-@xmath96 terms in eq .",
    "cancel .",
    "furthermore , if we ignore the backreaction of this scattering process on the background distribution of photons , so that @xmath83 can be assumed to be time independent ; then @xmath97 , the bose - einstein distribution for a massless spin-1 particle . for simplicity , let us also integrate over all possible final directions of the photon .",
    "altogether , we are now lead to @xmath98 to be clear , our notation for the incoming @xmath52 and outgoing @xmath54 momenta is @xmath99 so that , for instance @xmath100 is the integral over the solid angle of the incoming photon .",
    "note that , because scattering does not change the total number of photons present , integrating the right hand side of eq .",
    "with respect to @xmath101 ( from @xmath78 to @xmath102 ) would yield zero .",
    "we will later use this as a check of our numerical calculations .    to summarize what we have found so far : for a given cosmic string loop trajectory ( and the relevant left- and right - movers @xmath103 ) , first determine the modes @xmath68s in eq .",
    ", and afterwards insert them into eq . to obtain @xmath86 . then the rate of photon scattering off the cosmic string per unit energy , is obtained by evaluating the boltzmann integral in eq . .",
    "in @xcite , an analysis was performed for the gravitationally induced pair production rate of photons without specializing to a particular cosmic string loop trajectory .",
    "this is possible because , for the pair production case , there exists asymptotic expansions of eq . by utilizing the large dimensionless phase @xmath104 .",
    "( in other words , one can exploit the large ratio of the astrophysical length of the string to the microscopic wavelength of the photon . ) for instance , one may seek a saddle point of the @xmath105 , i.e. search for configurations @xmath106 where @xmath107 . because @xmath108 and @xmath109 are null vectors , that means @xmath110 must be spacelike or null for a saddle point to exist .",
    "that in turn implies @xmath85 and @xmath84 are collinear , since we require @xmath111 .",
    "a slight deviation ( in , say , the direction vectors @xmath112 and @xmath113 ) from this configuration would fail to satisfy the stationary phase condition and therefore lead to a subdominant pair production rate ; this in turn yields estimates on how very narrow regions ( whose widths scale as some inverse power of @xmath62 ) in angular space provide the dominant contribution to the @xmath105 integrals . in all , what @xcite found was that the energy emitted due to the pair of photons was largely independent of the mode number @xmath62 ; in other words , equal power in photon pairs were emitted at each harmonic @xmath114 .",
    "for the scattering case at hand , such an asymptotic analysis appears to be more difficult .",
    "for example , the stationary phase condition now becomes @xmath115 ; but with the minus sign instead of a plus sign ( as was the case for pair production ) , the requirement that @xmath116 is spacelike or null yields no useful constraint on the configuration @xmath106 .",
    "another important difference is that , for the pair production process , because @xmath117 , the rate at a given @xmath62 , without performing the analogous infinite sum in eq . , is already a physical quantity of interest ; it is the power generated at a given energy @xmath118 . for the scattering process ,",
    "on the other hand , we wish to ask how many net photons are being added or subtracted , at a given @xmath101 , from the background thermal bath .",
    "this means , for a fixed @xmath101 we have to perform both the solid angle integrals and the infinite sum over @xmath62 in eq . in order to obtain a physical quantity",
    "however , at least for the two photon temperatures we have considered , we shall find that the dominant contribution to the infinite sum come from the small @xmath119 terms , specifically @xmath120 .",
    "so as to achieve a concrete estimate of scattering rates of photons off cosmic strings , we shall therefore , in this section , specialize to the `` degenerate '' kinky loop trajectory that was also used in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "specifically , the left- and right - movers of the kinky loop are @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath123 are constant unit vectors .",

    "this is not the case , but rather , @xmath139 the third line of eq .",
    "contains all the remaining dependence on angles and is finite for all @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath113 , because @xmath62 is an integer and @xmath140 is finite at @xmath141 .",
    "_ @xmath142 can be dropped _",
    "we also note that the @xmath142 term in eq .",
    "can in fact be dropped because , in this limit , the bose - einstein factors on the first line of eq .",
    "goes to zero while the rest of the integrand is finite .",
    "explicitly , the bose - einstein factors , when @xmath143 , can be expanded as @xmath144 ( for later use , we have expanded up to @xmath145 . )",
    "this leads us to the following expansion of the small @xmath62 terms of eq .",
    ", @xmath146 for @xmath147 , this expression is non - singular for all @xmath101 , and therefore zero when the limit @xmath148 is taken .",
    "we also remark that , in the preceding discussion on the collinear limit , if we took @xmath138 followed by @xmath149 , we would find the boltzmann integrand in eq",
    ". would read @xmath150 in other words , the two limits @xmath138 and @xmath148 commute and yield a zero integrand .",
    "_ average over loop configurations _ if we were able to integrate over the solid angles with respect to the incoming and outgoing photon directions ( @xmath112 and @xmath113 ) , the resulting expression must only depend on @xmath122 and @xmath123 through the euclidean dot product @xmath151 , since the scattering rate is a scalar and there are no other vectors in the current problem .",
    "the result would allow one to see how the scattering rate per unit energy @xmath101 depends on the kinky loop configuration .",
    "however , in this paper , we shall be content with obtaining an estimate of the rate of scattering averaged over all possible kinky loop configurations  if we assume a uniform distribution , this means we shall now examine @xmath152 notice the boltzmann integrand in eq .",
    "has factorized into three portions : the first line is independent of @xmath122 and @xmath123 ; the second depends solely on @xmath122 and the third solely on @xmath123 .",
    "this means the averaging in eq .",
    "also factorizes into two independent solid angle integrals , one with respect to @xmath122 and the other with respect to @xmath123 .",
    "in fact , the primary integrals we need are @xmath153 by a flip of parity , @xmath154 or @xmath155 , we see that these two integrals are actually the same , @xmath156 .",
    "therefore let us focus on the first .",
    "observe that the only vector in the integrand is @xmath157 , and the integral transforms as a rank 2 tensor under o@xmath158 transformations : for @xmath159 , where @xmath160 o@xmath158 , we have @xmath161 .",
    "therefore we may fix the form of @xmath162 to be @xmath163 where @xmath164 are o@xmath158 scalars .",
    "contracting both sides with @xmath165 and with @xmath166 allow us to solve for @xmath167 and @xmath168 in terms of the two scalar integrals @xmath169 where @xmath170 .",

    "( for small @xmath274 , due to numerical underflow we do not integrate beyond @xmath275 but we simply stop at some @xmath62 that yields @xmath276 that are many tens of orders of magnitude below @xmath277 . )",
    "then we use the mathematica function interpolation to compute a best fit line to the resulting numerical data and proceed to approximate the summation for @xmath270 by an integral over the fit range , @xmath278 .",
    "we find that , for each @xmath101 , the sum over the first ten @xmath279 is usually responsible for roughly 91 percent of @xmath280 .",
    "when numerically evaluating @xmath276 we have found it useful to not do it over the entire range of @xmath211 , but rather start from integrating from the lower limit @xmath281 to @xmath282 $ ] , where @xmath283 is the upper limit ( for instance , @xmath284 and @xmath285 for @xmath261 ) , then from @xmath281 to @xmath286 $ ] , etc .",
    ", until the error incurred is less than one percent .",
    "this algorithm is justified because , as already explained after eq . , we expect our integrand to always peak near @xmath220 .",
    "practically speaking , this saves mathematica considerable amount of time and effort when sampling the integrand .    as a check of our calculation",
    ", we fit a line through the numerical data points of our plots in fig .",
    "[ boltzmannintegral_plot ] and find that the area above the @xmath101-axis is equal to the area below the @xmath101-axis at the sub - percent level .",
    "this is both consistent with our demand for percent - level accuracy in the numerical integrations of @xmath276 , as well as the physical requirement that scattering processes do not change the net photon number .",
