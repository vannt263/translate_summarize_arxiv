    "we employ the stochastic methodology to model the galactic cosmic rays ( gcr ) transport in the heliosphere .",
    "modulation of the gcr is a result of an action of four primary processes : convection by the solar wind , diffusion on irregularities of hmf , particles drifts in the non - uniform magnetic field and adiabatic cooling .",
    "transport of the gcr particles in the heliosphere can be described by the parker transport equation @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is an omnidirectional distribution function of three spatial coordinates @xmath2 , particles rigidity @xmath3 and time @xmath4 ; @xmath5 is the solar wind velocity , @xmath6 the drift velocity , and @xmath7 is the symmetric part of the diffusion tensor of the gcr particles . +",
    "this paper is an extension of our previous results presented in @xcite .",
    "we have presented @xcite that the gcr transport can be effectively modelled based on the solution of the set of stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) corresponding to the pte ( [ parkereq ] ) .",
    "firstly , the pte must be brought to the form of the backward fokker - planck equation ( e.g.@xcite ) , and then the corresponding sdes must be solved numerically . in @xcite",
    "the euler - maruyama method was applied . in this paper",
    ", we increase the accuracy of the sdes solution by applying the higher order methods i.e. milstein and stochastic runge - kutta .",
    "the euler - maruyama method of solution of the sdes is unconditionally stable in the higher dimensions and does nt rely on the numerical grid .",
    "all integration method involves the statistical error , which can be reduced by increasing the number of simulated pseudoparticles and applying the higher order integration method e.g. milstein s method or runge - kutta method e.g.@xcite .",
    "these three methods improve the approximation of the solution by applying higher order extension of the sde solution in the ito - taylor series e.g.@xcite .",
    "the euler - maruyama method has order of convergence @xmath8 , addition just one more term from the ito - taylor expansion the order of convergence increases for the milstein method up to @xmath9 . in turn",
    ", the stochastic runge@xmath10kutta method requires to generate a new random variable @xmath11 resulting in strong order of convergence with @xmath12 .",
    "+ let s consider a basic sde : @xmath13depending on the applied method the numerical approximation of the solution can be obtained by following formulas : where @xmath14 and @xmath15 and @xmath16 is an additional wiener process e.g.@xcite .",
    "the pte ( eq.[parkereq ] ) in the 3-d heliocentric spherical coordinate system @xmath17 written as time - backward fpe diffusion equation has the form : @xmath18 the coefficients @xmath19, ... ,@xmath20 are presented in detail in @xcite . depending on the choice of the numerical approximation the corresponding to eq.[backwardparker ] set of sdes has a form : @xmath21        the @xmath22 , @xmath23 , is the lower triangular matrix presented in @xcite , and the coefficients @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 have the form : + @xmath28 ;    @xmath29 ;    @xmath30 ;    @xmath31 .",
    "we performed the simulation applying all three methods given by eqs.[sde_all ] .",
    "the trajectory of @xmath32 pseudoparticles was traced backward in time in the spherical heliocentric coordinate system .",
    "the pseudoparticles were initialized in the point representing the earth s orbit ( i.e. @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) and traced backward in time until crossing the heliosphere boundary assumed at 100 au ( see fig . 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "the value of the particle distribution function @xmath36 for the starting point was be found as an average of @xmath37 value for pseudoparticles characteristics at the entry positions , @xmath38 , where @xmath37 is the cosmic ray local interstellar spectrum taken as in @xcite for rigidity @xmath3 of the @xmath39 particle at the entrance point .",
    "+        in the case when we know the analytical solution it is easy to compare the efficiency of each numerical method .",
    "however , here we do not have such a possibility .",
    "thus , we have compared the simulated galactic protons rigidity spectra for a@xmath400 solar magnetic cycle .",
    "[ fig : figall]a presents that all applied numerical schemes resulted in the same spectra , slight differences are seen for the lower rigidity particles .",
    "the obtained spectrum is in agrement with results presented in @xcite .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] presents the trajectories of the pseudoparticles with rigidity 10 gv for the a@xmath400 solar magnetic cycle with respect to all coordinates . to allow the reliable comparison",
    "all simulations were based on the same wiener process .",
    "one can see that there arises some subtle differences : the trajectories of pseudoparticles vs. the heliolongitude are the widest for euler - maruyama and narrow for the runge - kutta method . at the same time",
    "the opposite distribution is observed vs. the heliolatitude .",
    "additionally , we have estimated the histograms of the particles rigidity and the particles exit time for all three methods . fig .  [",
    "fig : figall]bc show that the time of traveling the pseudoparticles throughout the heliosphere is the longest applying the stochastic runge - kutta , at the same time particles loses less energy during travel .",
    "+ the obtained results suggest that all applied methods give a reliable results . performed tests proved that the milstein and stochastic runge - kutta methods are more stable and return the same values of differential spectra when we decrease the number of simulated particles by factor of three .",
    "however , the slight differences between the pseudoparticles trajectories and its characteristics ( rigidity and exit time ) given by the tested numerical schemes must be analyzed in more detail .",
