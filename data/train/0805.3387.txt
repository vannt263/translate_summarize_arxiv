    "studies of exclusive hadronic final states in two - photon collisions give valuable information on the physics of light and heavy - quark resonances , perturbative and nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and hadron - production mechanisms .",
    "so far , belle has measured the production cross sections of charged - pion pairs  @xcite , charged- and neutral - kaon pairs  @xcite , and proton - antiproton pairs  @xcite .",
    "we have also analyzed @xmath12-meson - pair production finding a new charmonium state identified as the @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "here we present the cross sections and an analysis of high - statistics neutral - pion pair production in two - photon processes .",
    "the motivation of this study is essentially the same as that for charged - pion pair production .",
    "however , the two processes are physically different and independent ; we can not predict one by measuring only the other .    in the low energy region ( @xmath14  gev , where @xmath3 is the center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "energy of the @xmath15 system ) , it is expected that the difference of meson electric charges plays an essential role in the difference between the @xmath16 and @xmath17 cross sections .",
    "predictions are not straightforward because of non - perturbative effects . in the intermediate energy range ( @xmath18  gev ) ,",
    "formation of meson resonances decaying to @xmath19 is the dominant contribution .",
    "since ordinary @xmath20 mesons conserve isospin in decays to @xmath19 , we can restrict the @xmath21 quantum numbers of the meson produced by two photons to be @xmath22(even)@xmath23 , that is , @xmath24 mesons .",
    "the ratio of the @xmath25-meson s branching fractions , @xmath26 is 1/2 from isospin invariance .",
    "however , interference of resonances with the continuum component , which can not be precisely calculated , distorts this ratio even near the resonant peaks .",
    "a long - standing puzzle in qcd is the existence and structure of low mass ( @xmath27 ) scalar mesons  @xcite .",
    "they , in particular , the @xmath28 ( @xmath29 meson ) , are closely related to the qcd vacuum through spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry .",
    "two - photon - resonant production of a meson gives valuable information such as its two - photon width , which is sensitive to its charge structure .",
    "unfortunately , experimental constraints in a @xmath30 factory experiment do not allow measurements much below @xmath14  gev .    for higher energies ( @xmath31 )",
    ", we can invoke a quark model . in leading order calculations",
    "@xcite which take into account spin correlations between quarks , the @xmath17 cross section is predicted to be much smaller than that of @xmath16 , and the ratio of @xmath17 to @xmath16 is around 0.03 - 0.06 . however , higher - order or nonperturbative qcd effects can modify this ratio .",
    "for example , the handbag model , which considers soft hadron exchange , predicts the same amplitude for the two processes and hence this ratio is expected to be 0.5  @xcite .",
    "analyses of energy and angular distributions of the cross sections are essential to determine properties of the observed resonances and to test the validity of qcd models .    in this paper , we present measurements of the differential cross sections , @xmath32 , for the process @xmath0 in a wide two - photon c.m .",
    "energy ( @xmath3 ) range from 0.6 to 4.0  gev , in the c.m .",
    "angular range , @xmath2 .",
    "the 95  fb@xmath33 data sample results in several hundred times larger statistics than in previous experiments  @xcite .",
    "the data here are concentrated in the low energy region ( @xmath34 ) . in the higher energy region , many more resonances contribute and thus make an analysis based on a single experiment difficult .",
    "furthermore , statistics are still poor in this range .",
    "the angular coverage up to @xmath35 greatly enhances the capability for separating partial waves . in the low energy region ,",
    "the cross section is dominated by the @xmath9 . a clear peak corresponding to the @xmath10 is found for the first time in two - photon production of @xmath36 .",
    "furthermore , a `` model - independent '' partial wave analysis ( where interference terms of amplitudes are temporarily neglected ) reveals another resonance - like structure around 1.2  gev in the s wave . this may be due to the contributions of the @xmath9 in the d@xmath6 wave and/or scalar resonances such as the @xmath37 .",
    "we fit the differential cross sections assuming such contributions and obtain their parameters .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "apparatus ] , the experimental apparatus relevant to this measurement is briefly described together with information on the trigger and a description of the event selection .",
    "differential cross sections are derived in section  [ sec : crosssec ] . in section  [ sec : fitting ] , the measured differential cross sections are fitted to obtain the resonance parameters of the @xmath10 and a scalar meson as well as to extract the fraction of the @xmath9 in the d@xmath6 wave . finally in section  [ sec : summary ] a summary and conclusion are given .",
    "we use data that corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 95  fb@xmath33 recorded with the belle detector at the kekb asymmetric - energy @xmath38 collider  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath38 c.m .",
    "energy of the accelerator was set at 10.58  gev ( 83  fb@xmath33 ) , 10.52  gev ( 9  fb@xmath33 ) , 10.36  gev ( @xmath39 runs , 2.9  fb@xmath33 ) and 10.30  gev ( 0.3  fb@xmath33 ) .",
    "the differences between the two - photon flux ( luminosity function ) in the measured @xmath3 regions due to differences in the beam energies are small ( at most a few percent ) , and the fraction of integrated luminosity of the runs with lower beam energies is also small ; we combine the results for different beam energies .",
    "the variation of the cross section because of this effect is less than 0.5% .",
    "the belle detector is a magnetic spectrometer covering a large solid angle ( polar angles between @xmath40 and @xmath41 and the full azimuthal angle ) .",
    "a comprehensive description of the belle detector is given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "we mention here only those detector components that are essential to the present measurement .",
    "charged tracks are reconstructed from hit information in a central drift chamber ( cdc ) located in a uniform 1.5  t solenoidal magnetic field .",
    "the @xmath42 axis of the detector and the solenoid are along the positron beam direction , with the positrons moving in the @xmath43 direction .",
    "the cdc measures the longitudinal and transverse - momentum components ( along the @xmath42 axis and in the @xmath44 plane , respectively ) .",
    "photons are detected and measured in an electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecl ) located inside the solenoid .",
    "the ecl is an array of 8736 csi(tl ) crystals pointing toward the interaction point , which help separating photons from @xmath45 s for energies up to @xmath46 .",
    "we require that there be no reconstructed cdc tracks coming from the vicinity of the nominal collision point .",
    "photons from decays of two neutral pions are measured in the ecl .",
    "signals from the ecl are used to trigger .",
    "the ecl trigger requirements are the following : the total ecl energy deposit in the triggerable acceptance region ( see below ) is greater than 1.15  gev ( the `` hie '' trigger ) or the number of ecl clusters ( each crystal having more than 110  mev ) is four or greater ( the `` clst4 '' trigger ) .",
    "the above energy thresholds are determined from a study of the correlations between the two triggers in data .",
    "this trigger logic is realized in hardware ; no additional software filters are applied for events triggered by either of the two ecl triggers .",
    "the analysis is performed in the `` zero - tag '' mode , where neither the recoil electron nor the positron is detected .",
    "we restrict the virtuality of the incident photons to be small by imposing strict transverse - momentum balance with respect to the beam axis for the final - state hadronic system .",
    "the selection conditions for @xmath0 signal candidates are the following .",
