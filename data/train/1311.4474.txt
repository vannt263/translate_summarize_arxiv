    "uncertainty in quantum theory can be attributed to two different issues : the irreducible indeterminacy of individual quantum processes , postulated by born  @xcite , and the complementarity , introduced by bohr  @xcite , which implies that we can not simultaneously perform precise measurements of noncommuting observables .",
    "for that reason , estimation of the quantum state from the measurement outcomes , which is sometimes called quantum tomography , is of paramount importance  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in practice , unavoidable imperfections and finite resources come into play and the performance of tomographic schemes should be assessed and compared .    at a fundamental level , mutually unbiased bases ( mubs )",
    "provide perhaps the most accurate statement of complementarity .",
    "this idea emerged in the seminal work of schwinger  @xcite and it has gradually turned into a keystone of quantum information . apart from being instrumental in many hard problems  @xcite ,",
    "mubs have long been known to provide an optimal basis for quantum tomography  @xcite .",
    "when the hilbert space dimension @xmath0 is a prime power , @xmath1 , it is known that there exist sets of @xmath2 mubs  @xcite .",
    "these hilbert spaces are realized by systems of @xmath3 particles , which , in turn , allow for special entanglement properties .",
    "more specifically , we consider here @xmath3 qubits , as they are the building blocks of quantum information processing .",
    "it was known that for three qubits , four different set of mubs exist with very different entanglement properties  @xcite .",
    "the analysis was further extended to higher number of qubits  @xcite and confirmed by different approaches  @xcite . for the experimentalist",
    ", this information is very important , because the complexity of an implementation of a given set of mubs will , of course , greatly depend on how many of the qubits need to be entangled .",
    "in this work , we use fisher information to set forth efficient tools for assessing the quality of a wide class of tomographic schemes , paying special attention to @xmath3-qubit mubs . despite the widespread belief that mubs are equally sensitive to all the state features ,",
    "we show that mubs with different entanglement properties differ in their potential to characterize particular aspects of the reconstructed state .",
    "we illustrate this with the fidelity estimation of three - qubit states , making evident the relevance of mub - entanglement classification and illustrating the possibility to optimize mub tomography with respect to the observables of interest .",
    "let us start with a brief outlook of the basic methods we need for the rest of the discussion .",
    "we deal with a @xmath0-dimensional quantum system , represented by a positive semidefinite @xmath4 density matrix @xmath5 .",
    "a very convenient parametrization of @xmath5 can be achieved in terms of a traceless hermitian operator basis @xmath6 , satisfying @xmath7 and @xmath8 : @xmath9 where the @xmath10-dimensional generalized bloch vector @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is uniquely determined by @xmath13 .",
    "the set @xmath14 coincides with the orthogonal generators of su(@xmath0 ) , which is the associated symmetry algebra  @xcite .    the measurements performed on the system are described , in general , by positive operator - valued measures ( povms ) , which are a collection of positive operators @xmath15 , resolving the identity @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "each povm element represents a single output channel of the measuring apparatus ; the probability of detecting the @xmath17th output is given by the born rule @xmath18 .    in a sensible estimation procedure",
    ", we have @xmath19 identical copies of the system and repeat the measurement on each of them .",
    "the statistics of the outcomes is then multinomial , i.e. , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the probability of detection at the @xmath17th channel and @xmath22 the actual number of detections . here , @xmath23 is the probability of registering the data @xmath24 provided the true state is @xmath25 .",
    "the estimation requires the introduction of an estimator ; i.e. , a rule of inference that allows one to extract a value for @xmath25 from the outcomes @xmath24 .",
    "the random variable @xmath26 is an unbiased estimator if @xmath27 . the ultimate bound on the precision with which one can estimate @xmath25 is given by the cramer - rao bound  @xcite , which , in terms of the covariance matrix @xmath28 , can be stated as @xmath29 where f stands for the fisher matrix  @xcite @xmath30 since @xmath31 , it might superficially appear that computing the fisher matrix ( and hence the covariances of the estimated parameters ) is straightforward",
    ". however , in practice , this can become quite a difficult task : the cost of computing @xmath32 matrix multiplications and inversions , even with the best - known exact algorithm  @xcite , scales as @xmath33 . for a system of @xmath3 qubits",
    ", this computational cost goes as @xmath34 , which sets an upper limit on the dimension for which the evaluation of the reconstruction errors is feasible .",
    "for instance , analyzing a system of just five qubits requires about a billion of arithmetic operations with individual elements , which makes the problem intractable along these lines .",
    "this especially applies when a large number of repeated evaluations is required , as in monte carlo simulations .",
    "this numerical cost can be considerably reduced by employing a special parametrization for @xmath5 . to this end , we restrict ourselves to informationally complete ( ic ) measurements , which are those for which the outcome probabilities are sufficient to determine an arbitrary quantum state  @xcite . given a system of dimension @xmath0 , any ic measurement must have at least @xmath35 output channels ; when it has just @xmath36 of them , it will be called a minimal ic reconstruction scheme .",
    "it turns out that the error analysis in this case is particularly simple and can be done analytically avoiding time - expensive computations .",
    "we remark that we are not addressing here the resources needed for a complete tomography ( which scale exponentially ) ; rather , our aim is to ascertain what can be better estimated from ic measurements .    indeed , for an ic minimal scheme @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , there exists a unique representation of any quantum state in terms of the basic probabilities @xmath39 : @xmath40 normalization reduces by one the number of independent parameters describing the state : @xmath41 ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 . in this way",
    ", we get @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) and @xmath46 , leading us to @xmath47    we thus conclude that the errors of any ic minimal scheme are given by the covariance matrix of the underlying true multinomial distribution governing the measurement outcomes . notice that this might not apply to other overdetermined setups , as , for instance , optical homodyne tomography .",
    "once the fisher matrix is known , the errors in any observation can be estimated .",
    "let us consider the measurement of the average value @xmath48 of some generic observable @xmath49 .",
    "if the reconstructed state is @xmath50 , the predicted outcomes are @xmath51 and the expected errors are @xmath52 ^ 2 \\right \\rangle \\ , , \\ ] ] where the averaging here is over many repetitions of the reconstruction . by expanding the observable in the povm elements , @xmath53 , the true and predicted outcomes can be given in terms of true and predicted measurement probabilities as @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively . denoting @xmath58 the differences between the true and inferred probabilities , the expected error of the observable @xmath49 defined by eq",
    "becomes @xmath59 next , we rearrange eq .   so that only @xmath60 linearly independent probabilities @xmath61 are involved .",
    "notice that @xmath62 implies @xmath63 and hence @xmath64 . in this way",
    ", we get @xmath65 employing the cramer - rao lower bound , we finally obtain @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the inverse fisher matrix in the probability representation given by eq .  .",
    "occasionally , working in the measurement representation might be preferable .",
    "expanding the true and estimated states in the measured povm elements , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , we seek to express @xmath70 in terms of the reconstruction errors @xmath71 .",
    "if @xmath72 is the matrix connecting the measurement and probability representations , then @xmath73 and we have @xmath74 , which is computed effectively provided @xmath75 is sparse . by inserting this into eq .",
    ", we get the desired result .",
    "one pertinent example for which this probability representation turns out to be very efficient is for mubs .",
    "as heralded before , we consider a system of @xmath3 qubits ; since the dimension @xmath76 is a power of a prime sets of mubs @xmath77 exist and explicit construction procedures are at hand  @xcite .",
    "we denote the corresponding projectors by @xmath78 where the greek index @xmath79 labels one of the @xmath80 families of mubs and @xmath17 denotes one of the @xmath0 orthogonal states in this family .",
    "unbiasedness translates into @xmath81 notice that , in agreement with the usual mub terminology , each set of eigenstates is normalized to unity @xmath82 , so that the povm becomes normalized to @xmath2 , rather than to unity .",
    "our previous convention is readily recovered by using @xmath83 as the total number of copies .    as the total number of projections [ @xmath84 minus the number of constraints [ @xmath85 matches the minimal number [ @xmath86 of independent measurements ,",
    "this mub tomography is indeed an ic minimal scheme .",
    "in addition , there are @xmath2 sets of vectors , each resolving the unity , so that @xmath87 holds for each observable @xmath79 .",
    "consequently , the fisher information matrix in the probability representation takes a block diagonal form @xmath88 and in each block @xmath79 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are given by eq .  .",
    "measurement errors can now be easily estimated . indeed , expanding a generic state in the mub basis as @xmath91 with @xmath92 , we find that @xmath93 and the total error appears as a sum of independent contributions @xmath94 of individual mub eigensets , with @xmath95    we can reinterpret these results in an alternative way . without lack of generality , we consider one diagonal block and drop the index @xmath79 .",
    "we introduce the operator @xmath96 by @xmath97 , with @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 .",
    "this can be represented by the rectangular @xmath101-dimensional matrix @xmath102 .",
    "if @xmath103 is the standard scalar product in this @xmath0-dimensional vector space , we may simply write @xmath104 where @xmath105 .",
    "notice that the inferred variance takes now the form of born s rule and the effective inverse fisher matrix @xmath106 becomes the relevant object governing the errors .",
    "for example , the mean hilbert - schmidt distance from the estimate to the true state becomes @xmath107 \\rangle=    { \\mathop{\\mathrm{tr } } \\nolimits}(\\tilde{\\mathrm{f}}^{-1 } ) \\ , , \\ ] ] which gives a unitary invariant error , as it might be anticipated  @xcite .",
    "another instance of interest is the error of the fidelity measurement @xmath108 . here",
    "@xmath109 the constant term @xmath110 can be dropped because @xmath111 enters eq .",
    "( [ eq : uf ] ) only through differences .",
    "these formulas , together with eq .  ,",
    "provide timely tools for analyzing the performance and optimality of different mub reconstruction schemes .",
    "for example , one could be interested in which observable can be most ( least ) accurately inferred from a mub tomography .",
    "this is tantamount to minimizing ( maximizing ) eq .",
    "subject to a fixed norm of @xmath112 .",
    "the principal axes of the error ellipsoid are defined by the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the effective inverse fisher matrix @xmath106 .",
    "notice that there is always one zero eigenvalue per diagonal block , corresponding to a constant vector @xmath113 ( @xmath114 , which , in turn , corresponds to measuring the trace of the signal density matrix @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the trace is constrained to unity and hence error free .",
    "thus , the least ( most ) favorable measurements from the point of view of a particular detection scheme are those given by the largest ( second smallest ) eigenvectors of @xmath106 .",
    "similarly , one may be interested in the distribution @xmath117 $ ] of errors among all possible inferred measurements . from eq .",
    "( [ scalarproduct ] ) , such a distribution is given precisely by the restricted numerical range or `` real shadow ''  @xcite of @xmath106 .",
    "once the formalism has been set up , let us see how it works for mub reconstruction schemes .",
    "the goal is to assess the performance of different sets of mubs for moderately - sized quantum systems .    for definiteness ,",
    "let us look at the case of three qubits .",
    "it is known  @xcite that mub sets can be divided into nonequivalent classes with respect to entanglement properties . in the eight - dimensional hilbert space of three qubits ,",
    "any complete set is comprised of 9 mubs .",
    "we label the different sets by @xmath118 , where @xmath119 denotes the number of separable bases ( every eigenvector of theses bases is a tensor product of singe - qubit states ) , @xmath120 the number of biseparable bases ( one qubit is factorized and the other two are in a maximally entangled state ) and @xmath121 the number of nonseparable bases . in this notation , there are four classes : @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 ( see the supplemental material for a detailed description ) . on physical grounds , one could expect that the performances of these four classes with respect to entanglement - specific state properties will also be different .    to clarify the question we apply the procedure developed so far . to tie the observable to entanglement properties",
    ", we consider the estimation of the fidelity error taking the inferred observable to be the projection on the true state , @xmath126 .",
    "the confidence in the inferred fidelity can be used at the same time as a simple criterion of the overall quality of the tomographic setup .",
    "class performs best on ghz , bipartite and separable states , but worst on w states .",
    "the differences are up to @xmath127 .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    in our simulations , genuinely tripartite ghz and w entangled three - qubit states were randomly generated , as well as bipartite and separable ones , and subjected to mub measurements .",
    "for each mub class , the expected error of the inferred fidelity was estimated and averaged over @xmath128 randomly distributed states .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . as we can appreciate , in average the @xmath122 scheme yields smaller fidelity errors for ghz - like states ( for bipartite and separable also ) and larger errors for w states compared to other mub sets .",
    "one also notices that the difference between ghz , bipartite and separable is small , while w are still different .    to understand this result better ,",
    "we have also investigated the noise in the measured data and calculated the correlations between the entropy of measurement probabilities and fidelity errors , restricting ourselves , for simplicity , to ghz and w states .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] confirms strong correlations between those two magnitudes and shows that for ghz states , @xmath122 tomograms are less noisy on average than @xmath123 tomograms .",
    "again , the opposite is true for w states .",
    "there is not a simple connection between state entanglement and mub classes , as one might naively anticipate .",
    "this demonstrates the key role played by error estimation along the lines presented here .     and",
    "@xmath123 bases , respectively .",
    "[ fig2 ] ]    finally , we consider a set of randomly chosen measurements @xmath129 , whose expectation values @xmath130 are inferred from the estimated state @xmath50 and analyze the probability distribution @xmath117 $ ] of the expected variances @xmath131 .",
    "this distribution , being the real shadow @xmath132 of the effective inverse fisher matrix , tells us how the errors are distributed in the set of all possible measurements and hence describes in detail the performance of a given reconstruction scheme . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the difference @xmath133-p_{(3,0,6)}[(\\delta z)^2]$ ] of the @xmath122 and @xmath123 shadows is approximated by histograms obtained from @xmath134 variances calculated for randomly generated measurements @xmath135 and randomly choosen ghz and w states for each mub set . for ghz states , the @xmath122 scheme yields very small errors and very large errors more often than the @xmath123 scheme .",
    "the opposite is true for w states",
    ". such complementary behavior of different mub sets makes it possible to optimize the tomography setup .",
    "for instance , quantities with low inherent noise are more precisely determined by the @xmath122 [ @xmath123 ] set provided the true state is ghz - like ( w - like ) .",
    "the fidelity measurement discussed above is a salient example of that optimization .",
    "we stress that this kind of analysis , where many repeated evaluations of the fisher matrix must be performed , is chiefly suited to the proposed method , for the standard approach would become quickly unfeasible due to the scaling with the system dimension .     and",
    "@xmath123 histograms of variances for ghz and w states .",
    "all histograms are normalized to unity .",
    "positive @xmath137 for some @xmath70 means error of this size is more typical for @xmath122 scheme than for @xmath123 scheme and _ vice versa_. [ fig3 ] ]",
    "to summarize , we have presented a complete fisher - information - based toolbox for the proper assessment of any ic tomographic scheme . in this context",
    ", we have discussed the case of set of mubs ; although all of them are ic , their performance for some particular tasks turns out to be dependent on the entanglement distribution among the states of the set .",
    "we believe that the ideas and techniques developed here will be relevant in the experimental implementation and optimization of quantum protocols in higher - dimensional hilbert spaces .",
