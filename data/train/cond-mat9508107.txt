    "a wide range of quasi - one - dimensional materials undergo a structural transition , known as the peierls or charge - density - wave ( cdw ) transition , as the temperature is lowered @xcite .",
    "a periodic lattice distortion , with wave vector , @xmath0 , twice that of the fermi wavevector , develops along the chains .",
    "anomalies are seen in the electronic properties due to the opening of an energy gap over the fermi surface .    over the past decade , due to the development of high - quality samples and higher resolution experimental techniques ,",
    "new data has become available which allows a quantitative comparison of experiment with theory .",
    "the most widely studied material is the blue bronze , k@xmath1moo@xmath2 .",
    "there is a well - defined three - dimensional transition at @xmath3 k and careful measurements have been made of thermodynamic anomalies @xcite and cdw coherence lengths @xcite at the transition .",
    "the critical region , estimated from the ginzburg criterion @xcite is only a few percent of the transition temperature and so the transition should be described by an anisotropic three - dimensional ginzburg - landau free energy functional , except close to the transition temperature .",
    "the challenge is to derive from a microscopic theory the coefficients in the ginzburg - landau free energy so a quantitative comparison can be made between theory and experiment .",
    "inspiration is provided by the case of superconductivity .",
    "the superconducting transition is well described by ginzburg - landau theory and the coefficients can be calculated from bcs theory @xcite and depend on microscopic parameters such as the normal state density of states , debye frequency , and the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "this program is so successful that one can even consider refinements to bcs theory , such as strong coupling effects , in order to get better agreement between experiment and theory @xcite .",
    "however , the problem of the cdw transition is more difficult because of the large fluctuations due to the quasi - one dimensonality .",
    "the peierls transition is described by an order parameter which is proportional to the @xmath0 lattice distortion along the chains .",
    "the order parameter is complex if the lattice distortion is incommensurate with the lattice . for a commensurate lattice distortion ( e.g. , a half - filled band )",
    "the order parameter is real .",
    "i recently considered the general problem of ginzburg - landau theory for a three - dimensional phase transition , described by a complex order parameter , in a system of weakly coupled chains @xcite .",

    "the coefficients in ( [ bg1 ] ) determine measurable quantities associated with the transition such as the specific heat jump , coherence lengths and width of the critical region .",
    "most of the physics is determined by a _ single _",
    "dimensionless parameter @xmath32 which is a measure of the fluctuations along a single chain .",
    "it was assumed that the coefficients @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 were independent of temperature and the measurable quantities at the transition were determined as a function of the interchain coupling .",
    "the transition temperature increases as the interchain coupling increases .",
    "the coherence length and specific heat jump depends only on the single chain coherence length , @xmath33 , and the interchain coupling .",
    "the width of the critical region , estimated from the ginzburg criterion , was virtually parameter independent , being about 5 - 8 per cent of the transition temperature for a tetragonal crystal .",
    "such a narrow critical region is consistent with experiment , and shows that ginzburg - landau theory should be valid over a broad temperature range .",
    "this paper uses a simple model to demonstrate some of the difficulties involved in deriving the coefficients @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath14 from a realistic microscopic theory .",
    "the basic physics of quasi - one - dimensional cdw materials is believed to be described by a hamiltonian due to frhlich @xcite which describes electrons with a linear coupling to phonons . even in one dimension",
    "this is a highly non - trivial many - body system and must treated by some approximation scheme .",
    "the simplest treatment @xcite is a rigid - lattice one in which the phonons associated with the lattice distortion are treated in the mean - field approximation and the zero - point and thermal lattice motions are neglected .",
    "the resulting theory is mathematically identical to bcs theory @xcite .",

    "if @xmath45 is the electronic bandwidth perpendicular to the chains ( see ( [ fk ] ) ) then the interchain coupling is given by @xcite @xmath46    it might be hoped that the transition in real materials can be described by the mean - field theory of the functional ( [ aa1 ] ) with the coefficients ( [ mfa]-[mfc ] ) . however",
    ", this is not the case for several reasons .",
    "( i ) the width of the critical regime given by the one - dimensional ginzburg criterion @xcite is very large : @xmath47 @xcite , suggesting that fluctuations are important because condition ( [ ad10 ] ) is not satisfied .",
    "( ii ) a rigid - lattice treatment predicts a metallic density of states at all temperatures above @xmath37 .",
    "in contrast , magnetic susceptibility @xcite , optical conductivity @xcite , and photoemission @xcite measurements suggest that there is a gap or pseudogap in the density of states for a broad temperature range above @xmath48 .",
    "( iii ) the transition temperature , specific heat jump , and coherence lengths are inconsistent with rigid lattice predictions ( table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "this failure should not be surprising given that recent work has shown that in the three - dimensionally ordered peierls state the zero - point and thermal lattice motions must be taken into account to obtain a quantitative description of the optical properties @xcite .",
    "the next level of approximation is to use the coefficients ( [ mfa]-[mfb ] ) and take into account the intrachain order parameter fluctuations and the interchain coupling and use results similar to those in references @xcite .",
    "this is the approach that has been taken previously @xcite .",
    "there are two problems with this approach .",
    "first , if the dimensionless parameter @xmath49 , given by ( [ aat1 ] ) , is evaluated using the expressions ( [ mfa]-[mfc ] ) the result is @xmath50 hence , the temperature dependence is quite different from the dependence @xmath51 that was assumed in references @xcite and the analysis there needs to be modified .",
    "the second and more serious problem is one of self - consistency .",
    "the coefficients @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are calculated neglecting fluctuations in the order parameter which will modify the electronic properties which in turn will modify the coefficients . in this paper",
    "a simple model is used to demonstrate that the fluctuations have a significant effect on the single - chain coefficients .",
    "an alternative microscopic theory , due to schulz @xcite , and which takes into account fluctuations in only the phase of the order parameter is briefly reviewed in appendix [ appsch ] .",
    "discrepancies between phonon rigid - lattice theory and the observed properties of the peierls state well below the transition temperature @xmath48 were recently resolved @xcite by taking into account the effect of the zero - point and thermal lattice motion on the electronic properties .",
    "it was shown that the lattice fluctuations have an effect similar to a gaussian random potential .",
    "this mapping breaks down near the transition temperature because of the phonon dispersion due to the softening of the phonons near @xmath0 . in this paper",
    "this dispersion is taken into account and the effect of the large thermal lattice motion near the transition temperature is studied .",
    "the thermal lattice motion has the same effect on the electronic properties as a static random potential with finite correlation length .",
    "close to the transition temperature , the problem reduces to a simple model , corresponding to a single classical phonon , which can be treated exactly ( section [ secham ] ) .",
    "this model was first studied by sadovsk @xcite .",
    "it was recently used in the description of the destruction of spin - density - wave states by high magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the one - electron green s function is calculated in section [ secgreen ] .",
    "there is a pseudogap in the density of states ( fig [ figdos ] ) .",
    "the complexity of this simple model is indicated by two non - trivial many - body effects : ( i ) perturbation theory diverges but is borel summable .",
    "( ii ) the traditional quasi - particle picture breaks down ( figure [ figspec ] ) , reminiscent of behaviour seen in luttinger liquids@xcite . to illustrate that calculations based on perturbation theory can be unreliable",
    "it is shown that a predicted scaling relation between the specific heat and the temperature derivative of the magnetic susceptibility @xcite does not hold if the _",
    "exact _ , rather than approximate , density of states is used in the calculation . using this model the coefficients @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31",
    "are calculated in appendix [ seccoeff ] .",

    "is used to estimate the pseudogap in k@xmath1moo@xmath2 .      to put this paper in context some important",
    "earlier work is briefly reviewed .",
    "lee , rice and anderson @xcite considered how fluctuations in the order parameter produce a pseudogap in the density of states .",
    "it is important to be aware of the assumptions made in their calculation .",
    "although their results describe much of the physics on a qualitative level , for the reasons described below , their results can not be expected to give a quantitative description of the density of states near the cdw transition .",
    "the starting point of lee , rice , and anderson was the one - dimensional ginzburg - landau functional ( [ aa1 ] ) with a _",
    "real _ order parameter and with the coefficients derived from rigid - lattice theory ( see equations ( [ mfa]-[mfc ] ) ) . earlier , scalapino , sears , and ferrell @xcite evaluated the correlation length @xmath52 for one - dimensional ginzburg - landau theory with an exact treatment of the fluctuations in the order parameter ; @xmath52 only diverges as @xmath53 .",
    "the results of this calculation were used by lee , rice , and anderson as input in a random potential with correlations given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the rigid - lattice ( bcs ) order parameter and the average is over the thermal fluctuations of the order parameter .",
    "the electronic green s function was calculated using equation ( [ af ] ) and a formula originally used for liquid metals ( essentially , second - order perturbation theory for the random potential ) .",
    "they found a gradual appearance of a gap as the temperature decreased . for @xmath56 an absolute gap of magnitude @xmath38 appears .",
    "lee , rice and anderson suggested that a three - dimensonal transition occurs for @xmath57 based on the temperature at which @xmath52 becomes extremely large .",
    "there are several problems with trying to use these results to give a quantitative description of the cdw transtion , because of the following assumptions .",
    "( i ) _ a real order parameter .",
    "_ most cdw transitions are described by a complex order parameter , for which quantitatively distinct behaviour occurs .",
    "for example , the transition to very large correlation lengths for @xmath57 does not occur for a complex order parameter .",
    "( see figure 6 in reference @xcite ) .",
    "( ii ) _ rigid - lattice coefficients . _",
    "it is shown in this paper that the pseudogap due to the thermal lattice motion causes the ginzburg - landau coefficients to deviate significantly from their rigid - lattice values ( figure [ figcoeff ] ) .",
    "( iii ) _ perturbation theory .",
    "_ it is demonstrated in this paper that this is unreliable . in particular as @xmath58 in ( [ af ] ) only a pseudogap rather than an absolute gap develops in the density of states ( figure [ figdos ] ) .",
    "rice and strssler @xcite calculated the contribution of the phonon fluctuations to the electronic self energy in the migdal approximation , i.e. , second - order perturbation theory .",
    "interchain interactions were included through an anisotropic phonon dispersion .",
    "they found a pseudogap in the density of states above the transition temperature . at @xmath48",
    "there is an absolute gap whose magnitude is determined by the electron - phonon coupling and the interchain interactions .",
    "they equated the observed transition temperature with the single - chain mean - field transition temperature @xmath8 which they found to be significantly reduced below the rigid - lattice value @xmath37 and to vanish as the interchain coupling vanishes .    in the limit of weak interchain interactions the analytic form of the density of states",
    "is identical to that of lee , rice , and anderson @xcite .",
    "however , it is not commonly appreciated that the origin of the pseudogap in the two calculations is quite different .",
    "the magnitude of the rice and strssler pseudogap is proportional to the thermal lattice motion ( compare section [ sectherm ] ) , while the pseudogap studied by lee , rice , and anderson pseudogap is by assumption equal to the rigid - lattice gap @xmath55 .",
