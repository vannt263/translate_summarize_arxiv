    "we find the impurities make the equal pairwise entanglement in a ring compete with each other . if impurities are of large couplings , the critical temperature and the pairwise entanglement which coupled to the impurities can be improved .",
    "our studying results not only provide a standard to judge impurities but also provide a way to enhance entanglement and critical temperature .",

    "we find that the introducing of impurities make the originally equal pairwise entanglement compete with each other .",
    "for the weak and strong @xmath16 , we can cut the ring chain into different open chain and then use the open chain property to explain the competition . for the case with nearest neighbor qubits , the change of the relative coupling @xmath45 can only affect the qubits which couple to the impurities . if introducing impurity with large @xmath16 and @xmath48 , the pairwise entanglement , which couple with the impurities directly , can be enhanced and critical temperature also will be improved .",
