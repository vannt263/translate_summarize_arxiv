    "the effect of quenched disorder on the long - distance physics of many - body systems largely remains an unsettled question despite decades of intensive research .",
    "ongoing controversies persist for instance on the equilibrium and out - of - equilibrium behavior of spin glasses and systems coupled to a random field.@xcite even though progress has been made , it has so far proven difficult to construct a proper renormalization group ( rg ) approach providing a description of ordering transitions and criticality in these systems .",
    "a technical reason for this unsatisfactory situation is that quenched disorder makes the system intrinsincally inhomogeneous and that one should in principle follow the renormalization of the whole probability distribution of the disorder .",
    "a physical reason is that the presence of disorder and of the resulting spatial inhomogeneity lead , for at least some range of the control parameters , to multiple `` metastable states '' .",
    "( at this point we use the term `` metastable state '' in a loose acceptance to describe configurations that minimize some energy or free - energy , action or effective action in field - theoretical terminology , but differ from the true ground state . )",
    "how such metastable states evolve upon coarse - graining under rg then represents the central issue : at large lengthscale , their influence could vanish , leaving only benign signatures in the thermodynamics , or else it could modify the critical behavior of the system , the nature of its phases , and , often in an even more spectacular way , the relaxation and out - of - equilibrium dynamical properties .    a well known example of the kind of puzzles associated with quenched disorder and metastable states is the failure of the so - called `` dimensional reduction '' property in the random field ising model ( rfim).@xcite standard perturbation theory predicts to all orders that the critical behavior of the rfim in dimension @xmath3 is the same as that of the pure ising model , _",
    "i.e. _ , in the absence of random field , in two dimensions less , @xmath4 .",
    "the property has been shown in a compact and elegant manner by parisi and sourlas@xcite by means of a supersymmetric formalism .",
    "however , dimensional reduction predicts a lower critical dimension for ferromagnetism in the rfim of @xmath5 , in contradiction with rigorous results.@xcite the dimensional reduction property must therefore break down in low enough dimension .",
    "the supersymmetric approach gives a hint at the origin of the breakdown , which appears to be related , yet in a somewhat obscure way , to the presence of multiple metastable states@xcite ( in this case , local minima of the hamiltonian ) .    over the years , and on top of numerous computer simulations and scarce exact analytical results , theoretical approaches have been devised to cope with disordered systems characterized by multiple metastable states , such as spin glasses and random field models.@xcite to list the main ones , we mention :    \\(i ) phenomenological approaches such as the heuristic domain - wall arguments@xcite and the `` droplet '' description,@xcite in which one directly focuses on rare excitations and the associated low - energy metastable states ;    \\(ii ) mean - field theories , combined with the replica formalism in order to handle the average over disorder ; for models with spin - glass ordering , the potentially dramatic effect of the metastable states is captured through a spontaneous breaking of the replica symmetry;@xcite    \\(iii ) specific rg techniques for low - dimensional ( @xmath6 ) systems , as for instance the coulomb gas rg approach for two - dimensional disordered @xmath7 models@xcite or real space rg for strongly disordered one - dimensional systems;@xcite    \\(iv ) the perturbative functional rg for energy - dominated disordered models considered in the vicinity of a critical dimension at which the fundamental fields are dimensionless;@xcite one must then follow the flow of a whole function , an appropriate renormalized cumulant of the disorder .",
    "as shown first by fisher@xcite for an elastic manifold pinned by a random potential , the long - distance physics is controlled by a zero - temperature fixed point at which the renormalized cumulant is a nonanalytic function of the fields , with the nonanalyticity encoding the effect of the many metastable states at zero temperature .",
    "all these approaches , however , are either questionable or not easily generalizable : on the one hand , the phenomenological approaches lack rigorous foundations and the relevance of mean - field descriptions to finite - dimensional systems is , to say the least , far from garanteed ; on the other hand , the perturbative functional rg becomes extremely complex , and soon untractable in practice for random field systems when going beyond one - loop calculations;@xcite moreover , it does not allow one to study the rfim ( as for specific rg techniques , they are not extendable by construction ) .    the purpose of the present work , described here and in a companion paper@xcite is therefore to propose a general theoretical framework that leads to a consistent description of the equilibrium behavior of the random field models and related disordered systems . to achieve this , we rely on a version of wilson s continuous rg via momentum shell integration.@xcite under various terminologies , `` exact rg '' , `` functional rg '' , and `` nonperturbative rg '' , it has been developed in the past 15 years to become a powerful method for investigating both universal and nonuniversal properties in statistical physics and quantum field theory.@xcite the approach is `` exact '' in the sense that the rg flow associated with the progressive account of the field fluctuations over larger and larger lengthscales is described through an exact functional differential equation .",
    "it is `` functional '' because through the exact equation , one follows the flow of an infinite hierarchy of functions of the fields in place of simply coupling constants .",
    "it is `` nonperturbative '' ( beyond the mere tautology that an exact description automatically includes all perturbative as well as nonperturbative effects ) because it lends itself to efficient approximation schemes that are able to capture genuine nonperturbative phenomena:@xcite to name a few , in the case of the standard @xmath0 scalar model , ( numerically ) tractable approximations describe the kosterlitz - thouless transition of the @xmath7 model in @xmath8 , known to be associated with the binding / unbinding of topological defects ( vortices ) , as well as the convexity property of the thermodynamic potential in case of spontaneous symmetry breaking , recovered in other treatments through nonperturbative configurations like instantons .    to study the problem at hand , we combine the ideas of the perturbative functional rg for disordered systems with the general formalism of the exact / functional / nonperturbative rg . in the following",
    ", we shall denote our approach _",
    "nonperturbative functional rg _",
    "( np - frg ) .",
    "it provides a framework to study both perturbative and nonperturbative effects in any spatial dimension @xmath3 and for any number of components of the fundamental fields , @xmath1 .",
    "we exclude from the scope of the present series of articles relaxation and out - of - equilibrium dynamic phenomena , as well as spin glass ordering .",
    "we also postpone to a forthcoming publication the development of the np - frg in a superfield formalism able to directly address the failure of supersymmetry in connection with that of dimensional reduction .",
    "short versions of the present work have appeared in refs .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .    in section",
    "ii we present the models and the formalism .",
    "we first introduce the models and discuss their physical relevance and the main open questions . from the corresponding replica field theories ,",
    "we then derive the exact rg equation for the effective average action , which is the generating functional of the one - particle irreducible correlation functions at the running scale .",
    "we next relate the replica formalism , in which the replica symmetry is explicitly broken through the application of sources , to the cumulants of the renormalized disorder .",
    "we close the section by writing down the exact rg flow equations for these cumulants .    in section iii , we introduce a systematic nonperturbative approximation scheme . after first discussing the symmetries of the problem and the way to implement them in the effective average action formalism",
    ", we introduce the nonperturbative truncation scheme of the exact rg equation : it relies on ( i ) an expansion in cumulants of the disorder and ( ii ) a well tested approximation of the nonperturbative rg , the `` derivative expansion '' , which uses the fact that the relevant physics is dominated by long wavelength modes to perform an expansion in the number of spatial derivatives of the fundamental fields .",
    "finally , we detail the minimal truncation that we use in our numerical investigation of the random field @xmath0 model ( rf@xmath0 m ) .    in section iv",
    ", we specialize the formalism to the study of the rf@xmath0 m .",
    "we introduce the scaling dimensions suitable to a search for the putative zero - temperature fixed point controlling the ordering transition .",
    "we first consider the case of the rfim and then extend our description to the rf@xmath0 m . with the help of these dimensions ,",
    "the rg flow equations are then cast in a scaled form .",
    "we also briefly comment on possible application to other disordered systems .",
    "we next discuss in section v an important property of the truncations previously described : because of the one - loop structure of the exact flow equations and of the appropriate choice of the approximations , one recovers the perturbative results both near the upper critical dimension , @xmath9 , and in the @xmath10 limit of the rf@xmath0 m .",
    "even more interestingly , we also show that our minimal truncation near the lower critical dimension for ferromagnetism of the rf@xmath11 m , @xmath12 , reduces to the perturbative functional rg result ( at one loop ) obtained from the nonlinear sigma version of the model.@xcite to the least , the truncated np - frg thus provides a nonperturbative interpolation in the whole @xmath2 plane of the known perturbative results near @xmath13 , @xmath14 , as well as @xmath15 .",
    "finally , the presentation and discussion of the results obtained for the rf@xmath0 m within the present np - frg approach will be described in the companion paper.@xcite",

    ", the models belong to the `` random field '' ( rf ) or the `` random anisotropy '' ( ra ) subclasses .",

    "however , the pure model with no disorder is merely a free field theory , and this is easily accounted for.@xcite      we have already stressed that solving the exact rg equation for the effective average action requires approximations .",
    "the general framework has proven quite versatile for devising efficient and numerically tractable approximations which are able to describe both universal and nonuniversal properties in any spatial dimension and to capture genuine nonperturbative phenomena ( see introduction ) .",
    "such approximations generally amount to truncating the functional form of the effective average action , which results in a self - consistent flow that preserves the fundamental structure of the theory ( as the symmetries , see above ) .",

    "we have seen in section ii - c that an _ expansion in number of free replica sums _ can be used to generate the cumulants of the renormalized disorder . keeping only a limited number of terms in the expansion",

    "to describe both the thermodynamics and the renormalized probability distribution of the disorder , one must consider at least the first two cumulants , or equivalently , the second order in the expansion in free replica sums .",

    "again , the accuracy and convergence properties of such field expansions have been widely tested for many different models . in the present case , and for reasons that will become clear later on , field expansions should be used with great caution .",
    "given the general scheme presented above , the choice of a minimal nonperturbative trucation is guided by a combination of factors : experience gained from studies on other models , constraints associated with the symmetries of the full theory , intuition or previous knowledge concerning the physics of the problem at hand , requirement of being able to recover as much as possible exact and perturbative results in the appropriate limits , and of course , a practical limitation coming with the numerical capability to actually solve the set of rg flow equations .    as we have already alluded to",
