    "the glass - forming materials are characterized by a huge variation of their transport properties ( viscosity , mobility , diffusivity ) and dynamical ( relaxation times ) properties , upon supercooling . as an example , the viscosity in the whole `` liquid '' range , if crystallization is avoided , increases of about 17 orders of magnitude by decreasing temperature before the system falls in the glassy state .",
    "the transition to the latter is conventionally fixed at the temperature , @xmath0 , where the viscosity reaches a value of @xmath1 poise .",
    "different systems show different temperature behavior of the viscosity , and they have been classified accordingly .",
    "fragility is an index measuring the steepness of the viscosity as a function of the temperature on approaching the glassy state : `` fragile '' systems ( high value of the fragility index ) are characterized by a super - arrhenius behavior of the viscosity , that increase very fast and -if extrapolated below @xmath0- seems to diverge at a finite temperature @xmath2 . in `` strong '' systems ( low value of the fragility index ) , on the contrary , the viscosity increase is less dramatic and follows an arrhenius law , apparently diverging only at zero temperature .",
    "the identification of the microscopic details that , in a given glass former , determine the temperature dependence of the viscosity , and thus the value of the fragility , is a long standing issue in the physics of supercooled liquids and glassy state .",
    "large numerical and theoretical effort have been devoted to the attempt to relate the fragility to the specific interparticle interactions ( e.  g. strong glasses are often characterized by highly directional covalent bonds , while the fragile one have more or less isotropic interactions ) .",
    "more recently , the attention has been focused on the possible relation existing between the fragility and the features of the potential energy landscape ( pel ) , more specifically the energy distribution of the minima of the pel and the properties of the basin of attractions of such a minima . with this respect ,",
    "a key point is the existence of a relation between viscosity ( or relaxation times ) and the configurational entropy @xmath3 ( i.  e. , the number of basins populated at given temperature ) , namely the adam - gibbs relation : @xmath4 this relation has been extensively tested against the experimental result , and it is now commonly accepted as `` correct '' . despite its success in describing both numerical and experimental data ,",
    "the adam - gibbs relation has not been still derived in a clear way from microscopic models .",
    "this leaves unsolved the question of the microscopic interpretation of the parameter @xmath5 , that is usually believed to be related to the properties of the transition paths between different minima of the potential energy , such as the height of the barriers or the connectivity of the minima . by using the adam - gibbs relation",
    ", one could expect to relate fragility to the properties of @xmath3 , i.e. , to the distribution of basins in the phase space of the system . however , this possibility is frustrated by the lack of knowledge on the parameter @xmath5 .",
    "indeed , once a model for @xmath3 has been chosen , one can obtain the whole range of experimentally observed fragilities by varying @xmath5 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "more specifically , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was observed that for a large class of models for @xmath3 - where @xmath3 is a concave function of @xmath6 that vanishes at a given temperature @xmath2 and assumes its maximum @xmath7 at high temperature ( `` gaussian - like models '' ) - the relevant parameter that actually determines the fragility is @xmath8 thus , fragility appears to be determined by the ratio between @xmath5 ( measured in units of @xmath9 ) and the total number of states @xmath10 ; it is related to both the distribution of minima ( through @xmath7 ) and the characteristic of the transition path between them ( through @xmath11 ) .",
    "the relation between fragility and phase space properties can be even more complicated , in those cases where the function @xmath3 does not belong to the gaussian class .",
    "the relevance of the concept of fragility also relies on the correlations that have been found between this index and other properties of glass - forming liquids .",
    "examples of these correlations are the specific heat jump at @xmath0 ( thermodynamic fragility ) @xcite , the degree of stretching in the non - exponential decay of the correlation functions in the liquid close to @xmath0 @xcite , the visibility of the boson peak at the glass transition temperature @xcite , or the temperature behavior of the shear elastic modulus in the supercooled liquid state @xcite .",
    "more recently a striking correlation between fragility and the vibrational properties of the glass at low temperatures has been found @xcite .",
    "specifically , by examining the dynamic structure factors of different glass former well below @xmath0 , it has been found that the fragility of the corresponding liquid is proportional to the rate of change of the non - ergodicity factor in the @xmath12 limit .",
    "being the latter quantity fully determined by the ( harmonic ) vibrational properties ( eigenmodes of the disordered structure ) , this finding implies the existence of a deep relation between three features of the pel : the energy of the minima , the transition paths between them ( that together determine the fragility ) and the hessian matrix , evaluated at the minima themselves , that fixes the vibrational properties .    with the aim to elucidate the existence of this unexpected correlation between energy , curvature and transition paths in the minima of the pel we selected a solvable model of `` glass '' , where i ) the distribution of minima is `` gaussian - like '' , ii ) the vibrational properties of the minima can be determined , and iii ) the transition path between different minima can be evaluated and characterized by an energy parameter .",
    "more specifically , we investigate the mean field p - spin model ( in both its spherical and ising spin version ) , a model that share with the structural glasses many aspects of the glass transition phenomenology , and that is known to have a gaussian - like distribution of states .",
    "our goal is twofold : _",
    "i ) _ we aim to verify if the analysis reported in @xcite is indeed correct in some microscopic model , i.e. , if one can obtain a wide range of fragilities in a gaussian - like model by varying the parameter @xmath11 , and _",
    "ii ) _ to check whether one can explain the correlation between fragility of the liquid and the vibrational properties of its glass found in @xcite by studying the geometry of the phase space . the latter point could allow us to shed light on the origin of the correlation between number of minima , their vibrational properties and the property of the transition path between them .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : definitions ] we define the relevant quantities in the case of the mean field p - spin model ; in sec .",
    "[ sec : sferico ] we compute them for the spherical p - spin model , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : ising ] for the ising p - spin model ; in sec .  [ correlazioni ] we discuss the relation between fragility and phase space geometry in these models , and compare our result with experimental data .",
    "finally , we draw the conclusions .",
    "the quantities we wish to compute are ( we will set @xmath13 in the following ) : @xmath14 first , we have to identify the proper definition of these quantities in a mean field model .",
    "the main problem is that in a mean field model the glass transition temperature @xmath0 is not a well defined quantity .",
    "indeed , the relaxation time of the system is known to diverge - as a power - law - when the temperature approaches the dynamical transition temperature @xmath15 , that corresponds to the usual mode - coupling temperature @xmath16 .",
    "the crossover from a power - law behavior of the relaxation time to an arrhenius - like behavior , observed around @xmath16 in finite dimensional systems , is due to the activated processes becoming relevant ; these processes are absent in mean field systems , and the crossover at @xmath16 becomes a true dynamical transition at @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "to overcome this problem , we will give an estimate of the height @xmath17 of the barrier that the system must pass through in order to escape from a metastable state at a given temperature @xmath6 .",
    "thus , we will make use of a `` fictitious '' adam - gibbs relation , @xmath18 and define @xmath0 by @xmath19 const , or , equivalently , by @xmath20 note that in this paper we will not distinguish between the `` complexity '' ( or `` configurational entropy '' ) @xmath3 , that can be calculated in mean field models , and the `` excess entropy '' measured in the experiments : indeed , they behave in a similar way in a wide class of systems @xcite .",
    "obviously , the quantity @xmath21 has no dynamical meaning in a mean field context , but it provides an useful definition of @xmath0 that hopefully coincides with the usual one in finite dimension .",
    "it will turn out that our analysis is not strictly dependent on this definition of @xmath0 , the behavior of the various quantities at @xmath0 being representative , as we will see , of a general trend observed at all temperatures @xmath22 $ ] by varying @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24@xmath25 $ ] in the spherical p - spin model . ]",
    "the easiest way to provide a definition of all the above quantities is to consider the two - replica potential approach introduced and discussed in @xcite .",
    "this function , @xmath26 , can be interpreted as the free - energy cost paid to keep two copies of the system at a fixed overlap  @xmath27 , @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the free energy of two copies of the system when constrained to have fixed overlap @xmath27 , and @xmath30 is the free energy of two independent copies of the system .    its qualitative behavior is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] for the 1rsb mean field p - spin spherical model : for @xmath31 it is a convex function of @xmath27 with only one minimum at @xmath32 . at the dynamical transition temperature",
    "@xmath15 a secondary minimum starts to develop at finite @xmath27 .",
    "on lowering the temperature below @xmath15 , the value of @xmath33 at the minimum decreases and vanishes at the thermodynamical transition temperature @xmath2 .    from the potential @xmath26 one",
    "can extract information about the complexity @xmath3 and the barrier height @xmath17 .",
    "indeed , it is well known that for @xmath34 the phase space of 1rsb models is disconnected in an exponentially high number of metastable states .",
    "the gibbs equilibrium state is a superposition of a subset of these states ( `` equilibrium states '' ) having a defined self - overlap @xmath35 ; however , the probability of finding - at equilibrium - two independent copies of the system in the same state is zero @xcite .",
    "different states have zero overlap , we therefore expect that the stable phase of the two copies of the system - i.e. , the one for which @xmath36 is minimum - is at @xmath32 .",
    "this is indeed the case as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] .",
    "the secondary minimum at @xmath37 can then be interpreted as a metastable state for the two coupled systems , that corresponds to the situation where both systems are in the same state with self overlap @xmath35 .",
    "thus , the value @xmath38 where @xmath26 has a secondary minimum can be interpreted as the self - overlap of the equilibrium states at temperature @xmath6 .",
    "the free energy of the system for @xmath34 can be written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the free energy of a single equilibrium state at temperature @xmath6 and @xmath3 is the complexity , i.e. the logarithm of the number of equilibrium states .",
    "the free energy of two independent copies of the system is @xmath41 , while the free energy of two copies constrained to be in the same equilibrium state is given by @xmath42 thus , @xmath43 and the equilibrium complexity @xmath3 can be deduced from the function @xmath26 .",
    "the difference between the value of @xmath33 at the maximum and the value of @xmath33 at the minimum can be interpreted as the height of a `` barrier '' that the two coupled systems have to overcome to escape from the situation where they are constrained to be in the same state .",
    "thus , we can define the `` barrier height '' @xmath44 .",
    "note that a system - dependent proportionality factor is needed in order to account for the cooperativity of the process of escaping from a state : indeed , @xmath36 is the free energy per spin , while an unknown number of spin can be involved in the escaping process .",
    "therefore , the @xmath17 defined above is an estimate of the barrier height up to an unknown ( system - dependent ) proportionality factor .",
    "the thermodynamical transition temperature @xmath2 is defined as the temperature where the complexity vanishes : @xmath45 .",
    "then , at @xmath2 the value of @xmath33 at the secondary minimum becomes equal to zero ( see fig .  [ fig_1 ] ) .",
    "the dynamical transition temperature @xmath15 is the temperature at which the metastable minimum first appears .",
    "we now provide a definition of `` glass transition temperature '' @xmath0 .",
    "as we discussed at the beginning of this section , using the adam - gibbs relation , the usual definition of glass transition temperature turns out to be @xmath46 the value of the constant @xmath47 is arbitrary .",
    "taking into account the fact that in the considered models @xmath5 is defined up to a proportionality factor , we can fix the value of the constant in order to obtain reasonable ( with respect to experiments ) values for the different quantities we want to study , fragility in particular .",
    "different choices of the constant change only quantitatively the results , while the qualitative picture stays the same .      given a definition of @xmath0 , the complexity at @xmath0",
    "is simply @xmath48 and the barrier height @xmath49 : clearly , these two quantities are related by eq .",
    "[ deftg ] . knowing the complexity as a function of the temperature",
    ", we can define the fragility as : @xmath50 the latter definition is very useful in a mean field context as - once a definition of @xmath0 has been chosen - it involves only the complexity , that is a well - defined quantity in mean field models .",
    "it is equivalent to the usual angell definition of fragility if @xmath51const , and the adam - gibbs relation is assumed to be valid @xcite .",
    "this definition of fragility has been shown to be related to the one usually considered in experiments in ref .",
    "@xcite .      as we discussed in the introduction , in ref .",
    "@xcite fragility has been shown to be correlated with an index related to the volume of the states populated at equilibrium around @xmath0 .",

    "therefore , the index @xmath56 defined in @xcite can be replaced by other equivalent - by equivalent we mean positively correlated - definitions ( like the definition of @xmath61 as a `` fragility index '' @xcite ) .",

    "[ fig_1 ] ) .",
    "as the self - overlap of the states is related to their volume in phase space ( high overlap corresponding to small states ) , a small value of @xmath56 corresponds to small - volume states , while a big value of @xmath56 corresponds to large - volume states . in this sense",

    "+ _ iii ) _ the height of the barriers between states increases .",
    "+ thus , we get the picture of a landscape where , on increasing @xmath23 , a great number of small states with very high curvatures and separated by very high barriers appear : a sketch of this evolution is given in fig .",
    "[ fig_9 ] .",
    "the behavior of the fragility in this situation is related to the behavior of @xmath112 , the ratio between number of states and height of the barriers between them : in these models , it turns out that @xmath5 increase faster than @xmath109 , and the fragility is a decreasing function of @xmath23 .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the fact that fragility turns out to be positively correlated with the `` volume '' of the states as measured by @xmath56 . indeed ,",
    "if , on the contrary , the barrier height grew slower than the total number of states ( equivalently , if @xmath85 would be positively correlated with the total number of states ) , there should be also an inverse correlation between @xmath85 and @xmath56 , in disagreement with what is experimentally observed .    in the @xmath113 limit , where the fragility becomes infinite , the second derivative with respect to @xmath27 of the potential @xmath26 calculated in @xmath32 and @xmath114 vanishes",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] ) and the so - called spin glass susceptibility diverges at the critical temperature . in other words",
    "when the fragility becomes infinite soft modes appear at the critical temperature supporting the previously presented physical picture .",
    "note that the outlined picture is valid for `` gaussian - like '' models , i.e. , models where the complexity is a concave function of the temperature that vanish at @xmath2 without any inflection point .",
    "these models seem to describe correctly the distribution of basins in real systems only for relatively high fragilities .",
    "the behavior of the complexity ( or configurational entropy , or excess entropy ) as a function of temperature for very strong systems is still an open problem ; our discussion may not apply to these systems .",
    "from the investigation of two mean field p - spin models , we proposed a picture for the evolution of the free - energy landscape from fragile liquids to strong ones .",
    "this picture accounts for the recently observed correlation between fragility of a liquid and vibrational properties of the corresponding glass .",
    "the main prediction of our analysis is that the total number of states and the adam - gibbs parameter @xmath5 should both be decreasing functions of the fragility .",
    "unfortunately , existing data are not sufficient to strictly test this prediction ; the excess entropy is available only for few experimental systems , and numerical simulations are performed in a temperature range where the fragility of the investigated systems is approximately the same .",
    "we hope that this predictions can be tested in the future .",
    "we thank stefano mossa for a careful reading of the manuscript , and cristiano de michele , tullio scopigno , francesco sciortino and luca angelani for useful discussions .",
    "the two - replica potential is defined in ref .  @xcite as @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the equilibrium free energy , and @xmath117 is the overlap function .",
    "the following expression is then derived : @xmath118 the last integral can be rewritten as @xmath119 where @xmath120 , @xmath121 .",
    "this is exactly the expression of the @xmath122 times replicated equilibrium partition function , with the additional constraint given by the @xmath123-functions . using standard manipulations @xcite , it is rewritten as @xmath124 thus , evaluating the integral at the saddle point ,",
    "we get @xmath125 the matrix @xmath126 is defined by the following conditions : + _ i ) _ the elements on the diagonal are equal to 1 ; + _ ii ) _ the elements @xmath127 , @xmath128 , are equal to @xmath27 ; + _ iii ) _ all the other elements are determined by the maximization of @xmath129 . + as usual , one needs a parametrization of the matrix @xmath130 in order to perform the analytic continuation to non - integer @xmath131 and @xmath85 .",
    "a possible _ ansatz _ is @xcite ( in the example , @xmath132 , @xmath133 ) : @xmath134 within this _ ansatz _ , and using the relation @xmath135 \\ , \\ ] ] one gets @xmath136 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath137 is determined by @xmath138 .",
    "now , it is easy to check that the condition @xmath139 , together with @xmath138 , is satisfied if @xmath140 . thus , when @xmath36 is stationary , @xmath141 and the potential @xmath36 reduces to the one given by eq .  [ vq ] .",
    "+ the fact that when @xmath142 the matrix @xmath126 reduces to the usual 1rsb overlap matrix ( let us call it @xmath143 ) is general : indeed , the condition @xmath144 from eq .  [ vq1 ] is equivalent to @xmath145 this means that the function @xmath129 must be stationary with respect to all the elements of @xmath130 if @xmath142 , and we know that the 1rsb matrix @xmath143 provides a solution to this condition . as a final remark , we note that if @xmath146 , we have @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the usual 1rsb free energy . substituting this expression in eq .",
    "[ vq1 ] , one obtains @xmath149 using the relation @xmath150 that holds above @xmath2 . therefore , _ on its stationary points _ ,",
    "@xmath36 is given ( at the 1rsb level ) by this simple expression , that can be easily calculated in several models .",
