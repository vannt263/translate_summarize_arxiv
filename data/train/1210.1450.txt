    "generally , the sun is known to be the unique star dominating the geo - space environment .",
    "it is very important to understand and predict when and how the solar activity will take place in the near future .",
    "the investigation of periodicity of solar activity is a fundamental work for solar prediction . for this reason ,",
    "we need to find out and confirm each periodic mode of solar activity , the correlations between the solar periodic activity and motions of the celestial bodies .",
    "the latter includes solar internal motions , external planetary motions , and the coupling among them .",
    "such investigation will help us to understand the real generation mechanisms of solar activities .",
    "however , as we know , because of lack of enough reliable long - term observations , uncertainties do exist in almost all the deduced results in some extent , including the solar quasi - periodic modes with various timescales .",
    "there are a lot of works on the analysis of solar periodic modes , and their generation mechanisms . and",
    "the latter is also including the planetary influences ( wolff & patrone , 2010 ) . in previous works ,",
    "many periodic modes are registered from the analysis of different solar proxies ( e.g. , yearly averaged sunspot number , cosmogenic isotopes , historic records , radiocarbon records in tree - rings , etc . ) , for example , the 11 yr solar cycle , 51.5 yr period ( tan , 2011 ) , 53 yr period ( le & wang , 2003 ) , 80 - 90 yr period ( gleissberg , 1971 ) , the 65 - 130 yr quasi - periodic secular cycle ( nagovitsyn , 1997 ) , about 100 yr periodic cycle ( frick et al , 1997 ; le & wang , 2003 ; tan , 2011 ) , 160 - 270 yr double century cycle ( schove , 1979 ) , 203 yr suess cycle ( suess , 1980 ) . otaola & zenteno ( 1983 ) proposed that long term cycles within the range of 80 - 100 and 170 - 180 yr are existed certainly .",
    "the above solar periodic modes belong to long - term periodicity .",
    "however , there are also some mid - term periodicity , which is defined as the timescale between 27 d and 11 yr , the lower limit means the period of solar rotation , and the upper limit is just the period of the most famous solar schwabe cycle .",
    "numerous works also reported the solar mid - term periodic modes .",
    "for example , 53 d , 85 d , 152 d , 248 d , 334 d , 683 d , etc . derived from the analysis of solar flare index ( kilcik et al .",
    "2010 , etc . )    in this work , we make a detailed investigation of the quasi - periodic modes with mid - term and long - term timescales of solar activity by analysis of long - term data set of the microwave emission at frequency of 2.80 ghz and the relative sunspot number . the generation mechanisms of different solar periodic modes have not yet been understood completely .",
    "we try to make a comprehensive comparison between the solar periodic modes and the planetary motions , and attempt to find out their relationships .",
    "the planetary motions include the planetary sidereal motion and the conjunction motions of planets .",
    "section 2 introduces the observation data and the corresponding analysis methods .",
    "section 3 presents the main results of the periodicity analysis of solar activity .",
    "section 4 is the physical discussions of the relationships between solar quasi - periodic modes and the planetary orbital periods or conjunction motion of some planets .",
    "finally , conclusions are obtained in section 5 .",
    "generally , the relative sunspot number ( rsn ) is regarded as the most important indicator of solar activities .",
    "it actually reflects the intensity of solar magnetic activity , and the later always dominates all the solar eruptions , such as solar flares , cmes , and filament eruptions , etc . since 1700 , an unbroken record of rsn is accumulated .",
    "the data set of rsn can be downloaded from the solar - geophysical data ( sgd ) prompt reports at web site : http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov .",
    "when we investigate the solar long - term periodic activity , we may analyze the annual averaged rsn ( asn ) dataset during 1700 - 2011 with data length of @xmath2 yr . and when we investigate the solar mid - term or short - term periodic activity we may adopt the daily rsn records conveniently .    from the sgd prompt reports , we can also obtain the daily solar total flux of microwave emission at frequency of 2.80 ghz ( @xmath3 ) and the daily rsn since 1947 . and",
    "after 1965 - 01 - 01 , the data set of @xmath3 and rsn is continuous in everyday without even one day drop . as we know @xmath3 is most sensitive to the solar activity ( kundu , 1960 ) and can be regarded as the most effective indicator for analyzing the solar activity , it is also the frequency where the strongest correlations of the radio emission with the sunspot number and the ionization index of the coronal e - layer occurred .",
    "so , we adopt the daily rsn and @xmath3 during from 1965 - 01 - 01 to 2011 - 12 - 31 to study the mid - term solar periodicity , the data length is @xmath4 days . in this work ,",
    "we are interested in the long - term periodicity with timescale longer than 10 yr and the mid - term periodicity with timescale between 27 d ( the rotation period of the sun ) and 10 yr . in order to reduce the sum of calculation",
    ", we transform daily data into 5-day averaged data when we investigate the mid - term periodic modes of solar activities .      in order to investigate the periodicity of solar activities , two methods are adopted to analyze the time series observation data and present a comparison .",
    "\\(1 ) fast fourier transformation    the first one is the fast fourier transformation ( fft ) , which can decompose a mixed time series signal into a series of sine or cosine components with different periods .",
    "an obvious periodic mode is represented by a sharp peak on the profile of fourier power spectra of fft analysis .",
    "the bottom panel of figure 1 is the power spectrum of fft analysis on the annual averaged rsn ( asn ) during 1700 - 2011 , and this power spectrum can provide the information of the solar long - term periodic modes .",
    "figure 2 shows the fourier power spectra profile of fft analysis on @xmath3 and rsn from 1965 - 01 - 01 to 2011 - 12 - 31 , and these spectrums can provide the information of solar mid - term periodic modes .",
    "the estimation of frequency errors of fft analysis can be obtained by the nyquist theorem : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the length of time series of the data .",
    "the period obtained from the peak value of fft spectrum symbolized as @xmath7 , the corresponding frequency is @xmath8 , then the frequency range is @xmath9 .",
    "the period range is from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , approximately ,    @xmath12    \\(2 ) wavelet transformation    the second method is wavelet transform analysis , which is a powerful tool for analyzing localized power variations in a time series data set , and can give the scale and time position of a periodic phenomenon occurred .",
    "here we use the morlet wavelet transformation ( mwt ) to determine the possible periodic modes concealed in the long - term observation data of asn , rsn , and @xmath3 .",
    "mwt is defined as a complex sine wave localized in a gaussian window ( morlet et al .",
    "the result of mwt can be plotted as a spectrogram in time - period space , where an obvious period mode is represented by a bright strip , the brighter the strip , the higher the confidence level . from the time - period spectrum , we may find out when the periodic mode occurred , and how the period changes with time .",
    "the middle panel of figure 1 is the power spectrogram of mwt on asn during 1700 - 2011 , which presents the detailed information of solar long - term periodic modes .    generally , the main features of solar activity are extremely different from the peak years to the vale years in solar schwabe cycles . the daily @xmath3 and rsn covers more than 4 solar schwabe cycles and 17166 d , the whole power spectrum of mwt indicates that the periodic modes around the peak years of the solar cycles are different from that around the vale years of the solar cycles .",
    "so , when we investigate the solar mid - term periodic modes we divide the 5-day averaged data set of each solar cycle into peak years and vale years .",
    "the peak years of cycle 20 - 23 are 1966 - 1972 , 1978 - 1984 , 1988 - 1994 , and 1999 - 2005 ; the vale years of cycle 20 - 23 are 1972 - 1978 , 1984 - 1988 , 1994 - 1999 , and 2005 - 2011",
    ". then we make mwt analysis on each data paragraph , respectively .",
    "figure 3 and figure 4 are the mwt power spectrograms on the 5-day averaged f28 and the 5-day averaged rsn around peak years and vale years in solar schwabe cycle 20 - 23 , respectively , which may present the detailed information of solar mid - term periodic modes .            in each panel",
    ", we find that there is an identical periodic mode marked by the horizontal dotted line , and the corresponding period is about 27 d. this mode is just the one derived from the above fft power spectra ( f1 and n1 ) .",
    "obviously , it is most possibly generated from the solar rotation .",
    "we do not discuss it in this work .",
    "the first glance at the profile of asn in the upper panel of figure 1 may tell us that there are at least two distinct different periods : one has a timescale of about 11 yr ( in the range of 9.5 - 13.5 yr ) , the other has a timescale of about 103 yr . the former is the well - known solar schwabe cycle .",
    "the later is always called as solar secular cycle ( gleissberg , 1939 , etc . ) .",
    "the fourier power spectra of fft analysis in the lower panel of figure 1 indicates that there are at least several periodic components : three periods with the confidence level of 95% : 11 yr ( marked as t1 ) , @xmath13 yr ( t2 , 47.7 - 56.3 yr ) , and @xmath14 yr ( t3 , 86 - 120 yr ) ; two periods with the confidence level of 90% : @xmath15 yr ( t1 , 20.76 - 22.24 yr ) and @xmath16 yr ( t2 , 27.2 - 29.8 yr ) . here",
    ", the errors are obtained from equation ( 1 ) .",
    "in fact , from a scrutinizing of the fft spectrum , we may find that the famous schwabe cycle ( t1 ) is a mixture of 3 different components : @xmath17 yr , @xmath18 yr , and @xmath19 yr .",
    "t1 is always regarded as the solar magnetic cycle with 22 yr period .",
    "the power spectrogram of mwt analysis on asn in the middle panel of figure 1 shows that the schwabe cycle is a bright band around 11 yr with the band width of 9.5 - 13.5 yr ( t1a - t1e ) ; t2 is relative weak in the range of 50 - 55 yr ; and t3 is a strong periodic component in the range of 90 - 110 yr ; t1 ( t1a and t1b ) and t2 also falls into the 95% confidence level on the power spectrum of mwt .",
    "the similar results can also be seen in previous works , for example , the co - existence of about 11-yr , 52-yr and 103-yr in le and wang ( 2003 ) , tan ( 2011 ) .",
    "otaola and zenteno ( 1983 ) reported the evidence of 21.5-yr and 28.5-yr solar cycles .      from the investigation of 5-day averaged @xmath3 and rsn from 1965 - 01 - 01 to 2011 - 12 - 31 , we obtain the details of the mid - term periodicity of solar activity . at first",

    "etc . ) .",
    "it is well known that the most obvious periodic modes in solar system are the planetary motions around the sun .",
    "these periodic motions include planetary sidereal motions around the sun producing tidal forces and the conjunction motions of two or more planets producing spring tidal forces on solar mass , and the latter can be called as spring tidal period .",
    "the spring tidal period of two planets can be calculated by : @xmath39 , and its integral multiples are also spring tidal periods . here",

    "the relatively close equality of the averaged solar schwabe cycle period and the sidereal period of jupiter was noticed for a long time . since the 19th century",
    "a theory has been proposed claiming that the solar activity is partially driven by the planetary tidal forces ( wolf , 1859 ; jose , 1965 ; wood , 1975 ; landscheidt 1999 ) . however , most existing literature focuses on discussing the relationship between the solar schwabe cycle with period of about 11 yr and the orbital motion of jupiter .",
    "the physics of the periodic modes of solar activity with multiple timescales is still an open question .",
    "we need to answer the following questions : how strong the planetary gravitational force acting on the solar plasmas ?",
    "what kind of planetary motion dominate which solar periodic mode ?",
    "what is the physical mechanism of the plc ?",
    "many people believe that @xmath56 acting on the solar mass may result in the solar activity ( jose 1965 , landscheidt 1999 , scafetta 2012 ) . as the tachocline layer is most possibly the source region of the solar magnetic fields ( parfrey and menou 2007 , etc . ) , similar to the other authors , we also calculate @xmath56 at tachocline layer :    @xmath57    here , @xmath58 is the planet mass , @xmath59 is the solar radius at tachocline level , @xmath60 is the averaged distance between the sun and the planet .",

    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     de jager and versteegh ( 2005 ) compared the three accelerations working on the solar matter at the tachocline level : the acceleration due to @xmath56 , the one due to the motion of the sun around the mass center of the solar system with the sum of planetary attractions , and the actual one due to connective motions in the tachocline level and above it .",
    "supposed an averaged solar convective velocity at the bottom of the convection zone , then the actual acceleration near the tachocline level is about @xmath66 @xmath67 sgu ( robinson et al . 2004 ) .",
    "they found that the later is much larger than the former two by several orders of magnitude , and pointed out that the planetary attraction is not the cause of solar activity , the main cause is purely originated from the solar interior .",
    "callebaut , de jager and duhau ( 2012 ) reconsidered the internal convective velocity , examined the magnetic buoyancy and coriolis force , and deduced that the planetary influences are too weak to be even a small modulation of the solar cycles .",
    "however , as we know that solar atmosphere is a huge plasma system , any equilibrium in such system is always flimsy and most unstable , even with a very small perturbation , the system will lost its equilibrium , and a variety of instabilities are very easy to develop , accumulate , and trigger a considerable outburst .",
    "recently , shravan , thomas , and katepalli ( 2012 ) use techniques of helioseismology to image the flows in solar interior , and find that the solar convective velocities are 20 - 100 times weaker than the previous theoretical estimations .",
    "if this fact is true , it will reduce the gap between the solar interior convective velocity and the planetary tidal motions to some extent .    in order to investigate the change rate of planetary tidal force acting on solar mass operated by the planets during each plc",
    ", we define another parameter , @xmath64 , it can be calculated by :    @xmath68    here , @xmath56 is the planetary tidal force or the spring tidal force of conjunction motions of two or more planets , the unit of @xmath64 is sgu / yr . the @xmath64 values are listed in the fourth column of table 1 . as a comparison ,",
    "the periods and @xmath42 are also listed in fifth and sixth column .",
    "we find that the tidal force of conjunction motion of venus , earth and jupiter is the strongest one ( 3.53 sgu ) with period of 11.07 yr , which is related to the solar periodic mode of 11.1 yr , this mode is just the one closest to the central period of the most famous schwabe cycle .",
    "table 1 shows that most tidal forces associated with plcs have the value @xmath69 sgu .",
    "the sidereal tidal force of venus is 1.40 sgu , but its period ( 224.7 d ) is very close to the spring tidal period of venus and jupiter ( @xmath70 sgu ) and easy to be submerged in the latter .    by adopting the parameter @xmath64 , we find that all the strong plcs have the values @xmath71 sgu / yr , and @xmath72 sgu / yr for all weak plcs . in this regime , we find that the biggest @xmath64 value is related to the conjunction motion of the mercury and jupiter ( 17.02 sgu / yr ) , the second biggest @xmath64 value is related to the conjunction motion of mercury and venus ( 10.23 sgu / yr ) .",
    "the @xmath64 values of the sidereal motions of mercury is very big , however , because the mercury sidereal period is very close to the spring tidal period of mercury and jupiter , which is very easy to be submerged in the latter .",
    "the venus s condition is similar to the mercury s .",
    "table 1 indicates that tidal forces operated by mars , uranus , and neptune are very weak relative to the other 5 planets by several orders of magnitudes , that we may neglect their tidal effects on solar activities .",
    "jupiter plays a key role in most periodic modes by its own sidereal motion or conjunction motion with other planets ( plc1 , plc4 , plc5 , plc7 - 1 , plc7 - 2 , plc7 - 3 , and plc8 ) . additionally , some of inner planets , such as mercury , venus and earth also play important roles in the formation of plcs .",
    "the conjunction motion and the related spring tidal forces of the planets dominate the formation of most plcs . such as the conjunction motion of venus / earth / jupiter , venus / jupiter , earth / jupiter , mercury / jupiter , mercury / venus , mercury / earth , and jupiter / saturn .",
    "this is understandable , because the strongest tidal force acted by any individual planet is only 1.47 sgu ( jupiter ) , while many spring tidal forces acted by conjunction motion of two or more planets are stronger than that acted by jupiter alone . as mentioned above , the conjunction motion of venus , earth and jupiter forms the strongest periodic mode of 11.07 yr and related to the most famous schwabe cycle .",
    "figure 5 shows the relationships between period ( @xmath73 ) and @xmath64 .",
    "it indicates that plcs have an obvious tendency of the value @xmath64 decreasing with the period increasing .",
    "particularly , strong plcs ( triangle signs ) are much more obvious with such tendency , while the weak plcs ( plus signs ) are more disperse .",
    "some people will also suspect that @xmath56 is still too weak to excite a considerable perturbation in solar atmosphere . and",
    "the difference between the planetary periods and the periods of plc also let us to distrust the relationships between planetary motion and the solar periodical activity . as we know that solar atmosphere is a huge magnetized plasma system , any equilibrium in such system is flimsy and most unstable . even if a very small perturbation can also disrupt the magnetized plasma system ,",
    "make it lost the equilibrium , and trigger a considerable instability .",
    "such instability can accumulate in a complicated way , and result in energy releasing .",
    "finally , the solar activity bursts out .",
    "the enormous energy released in the solar activity is essentially originated from the solar inner processes .",
    "here , @xmath56 just plays a role of blasting fuse of solar activity .",
    "recently , scafetta ( 2012b ) proposed that the planetary tidal gravitational energy can amplify the nuclear fusion in the solar core region , and result in the solar periodic activities .",
    "maybe this is a possible physical mechanism .",
    "based on the tidal cycles of the jupiter and saturn plus the dynamo theory , scafetta ( 2012a ) has shown that it is possible to reconstruct solar variability with a high accuracy at the decadal , secular and millennial timescale throughout the holocene .",
    "this work presents a comprehensive investigations of the quasi - periodic modes of solar activity with multi - timescale and their relationships with the planetary periodic motions . from this investigation",
    ", we may get the following conclusions :      a. strong plc , which is related strongly with planetary motions .",
    "this class includes 8 periodic modes : plc1 ( 85 - 90 d , averaged period is 89 d , close to the spring tidal period of mercury and jupiter ) , plc2 ( 115 - 120 d , averaged period is 117 d , close to the spring tidal period of mercury and earth ) , plc3 ( 140 - 150 d , averaged period is 146 d , close to the spring tidal period of mercury and venus ) , plc4 ( 230 - 240 d , averaged period is 236 d , close to the spring tidal period of venus and jupiter ) , plc5 ( 400 d , close to the spring tidal period of earth and jupiter ) , plc6 ( 360 - 370 d , close to the sidereal period of earth ) , plc7 - 1 ( 10 yr , close to the spring tidal period of jupiter and saturn ) , plc7 - 2 ( 11.1 yr , close to the spring tidal period of venus , earth and jupiter ) , plc7 - 3 ( 11.9 yr , close to the sidereal period of jupiter ) .",
    "this class mode has relatively short period ( @xmath0 yr ) , @xmath71 sgu / yr , low @xmath42 value , @xmath54 , and related to the motions of the inner planets and of jupiter .",
    "b. weak plc , which is related weakly with planetary motions .",
    "this class includes 2 periodic modes : plc8 ( 21.5 yr , close to the synodic period of jupiter and saturn ) and plc9 ( 28.5 yr , close to the sidereal period of saturn ) .",
    "this class mode has relatively long period ( @xmath1 yr ) , @xmath72 sgu / yr , high @xmath42 value , @xmath55 , and possibly related to the motions of outer planets .",
    "at the same time , because periods of weak plcs are always very long , and their error levels are always very large , the uncertainty of weak plcs can not be neglected .    c. non - plc , which is so far regarded as no obvious relationship with any planetary motions .",
    "this class includes the modes with period of 53 - 54 d , 70 - 75 d , @xmath13 yr ( t2 , 47.7 - 56.3 yr ) , and @xmath14 yr ( t3 , 86 - 120 yr ) .",
    "\\(2 ) among all the planets , jupiter plays a key role in most periodic modes by its own sidereal motion or conjunction motion with other planets .",
    "7 plcs ( plc1 , plc4 , plc5 , plc7 - 1 , plc7 - 2 , plc7 - 3 , and plc8 ) are dominated by jupiter .",
    "\\(3 ) among all the planetary motions , the conjunction motion of the inner planets dominated the formation of most plcs . such as the conjunction motion of venus / earth / jupiter , venus / jupiter , earth / jupiter , mercury / jupiter , mercury / venus , mercury / earth , and jupiter / saturn , etc .",
    "the closely connection between the mid - term periodic modes of solar activity and the planetary motions may imply that it can be applied to predict the solar activity in the near future . in our next step",
    "researches , we will focus on investigating the effects of the planetary motions to the solar short- and mid - term activity , and the detailed processes of the physical mechanism .",
