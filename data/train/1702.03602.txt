    "in the standard euclidean situation , pseudo - differential calculus arises as the weyl joint functional calculus of a non - commuting pair of operators : the position and momentum operators ( see , e.g. , @xcite and ( * ? ? ? * chapter xii ) ) . by transferring this calculus to the gaussian setting , in this paper we introduce a gaussian version of the weyl pseudo - differential calculus which assigns to suitable functions @xmath17 a bounded operator @xmath18 acting on @xmath19 . here ,",

    "the proof of the theorem provides an explicit estimate for the norm of this operator that is of the correct order in the variable @xmath34 , as subsequent corollaries show .",
    "taken together , and theorem [ thm:2 ] can then be used to obtain criteria for @xmath8-@xmath39 boundedness of @xmath7 for suitable values of @xmath10 with @xmath11 . among other things , in section [ sec : bbg ] we show that the operators @xmath7 map @xmath41 to @xmath42 for all @xmath11 .",
    "we also prove a more precise boundedness result which , for real values @xmath43 , implies the boundedness of @xmath24 from @xmath44 to @xmath19 , where @xmath45 .",
    "the boundedness of these operators was proved recently by bakry , bolley , and gentil @xcite as a corollary of their work on hypercontractive bounds on markov kernels for diffusion semigroups . as such , our results",
    "may be interpreted as giving an extension to complex time of the bakry - bolley - gentil result for the ornstein - uhlenbeck semigroup .    in the final section [ sec : epp ]",

    "various algebraic simplifications allow one to derive sharp results for the ornstein - uhlenbeck semigroup in a unified manner .",
    "this would , however , be obscuring the point that the weyl calculus gives the _ reason _ why these algebraic simplifications occur , as well as a tool to study other spectral multipliers associated with the ornstein - uhlenbeck operator ( and , possibly , perturbations thereof ) . in such applications , the algebraic consequences of the fact that the weyl calculus involves non - commuting operators",
    "may not be as easily unpacked as in .",
    "the @xmath4-analysis of operators in the weyl calculus of the pair @xmath57 , however , is simpler than the direct analysis of operators in the functional calculus of @xmath6 ( or perturbations of @xmath6 ) . in future works",
    ", we plan to develop this theory and include harmonic analysis substantially more advanced than the schur type estimate employed here , along with applications to non - linear stochastic differential equations .",
    "in this section we introduce the weyl calculus with respect to the gaussian measure . to emphasise its fourier analytic content , our point of departure is the fact that fourier - plancherel transform is unitarily equivalent to the second quantisation of multiplication by @xmath58 .",
    "the unitary operator implementing this equivalence is used to define the position and momentum operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 associated with the ornstein - uhlenbeck operator @xmath6 .",
    "this approach bypasses the use of creation and annihilation operators altogether and leads to the same expressions .",

    "the former says that position and momentum satisfy the ` canonical commutation relations ' and the latter says that the hamiltonian @xmath89 of the the quantum harmonic oscillator equals the number operator @xmath6 ( physicists would write @xmath90 ) plus the ground state energy @xmath91 .      motivated by the above constructions , we make the following definition .    for @xmath92 we define the operators @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 .    here , the rigorous interpretation of the unitary operator @xmath96 is through its action @xmath97 ( cf .",

    "this definition can be motivated by a formal application of the baker - campbell - hausdorff formula to the ( unbounded ) operators @xmath98 and @xmath99 ; alternatively , one may look upon it as defining a unitary representation of the heisenberg group encoding the commutation relations of @xmath98 and @xmath99 , the so - called schrdinger representation .    for schwartz functions @xmath100 we may use along with an integration and change of variables to obtain ( cf .",
