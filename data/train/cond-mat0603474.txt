    "polymer brushes are layers of flexible linear polymers on substrate surfaces produced by endgrafting one chain end via a special chemical endgroup of the macromolecule to the surface @xcite .",
    "such layers have numerous applications in the fields of colloid stabilization , lubrication , wetting , adhesion , etc .",
    "and hence they have found abiding interest .",
    "polymer brushes also pose challenging theoretical problems , since the confinement due to the grafting at the substrates causes the emergence of many distinct characteristic lengths needed even to describe the structure of a single chain in a brush @xcite , and although the density profile of the monomers in the direction normal to the grafting surface has been studied since a long time ago @xcite , the degree to which this profile is understood quantitatively still is a subject of current discussion @xcite .",
    "note that the overwhelming part of the very rich literature on polymer brushes ( see @xcite for reviews ) deals with brushes on planar flat surfaces only .",
    "occasionally the problem of brushes on the outside of spherical particles \\{e.g .",
    "@xcite } and on the inside of spherical cavities @xcite was considered ( as well as weakly curved flexible membranes , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , relatively little work has been done on grafted flexible polymers inside cylindrical pores ( apart from a few comments in @xcite and a study of a single grafted chain in a tube @xcite , a problem that is closely related to the behavior of single non - grafted chains confined in tubes @xcite ) .",
    "we note that small mushrooms grafted to cylindrical pores were considered as a means to control electroosmotic flow @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we intend to contribute to fill this gap , by presenting a study of polymer brushes grafted on the inside of cylindrical pores of radius r , varying also the chain length n and grafting density @xmath2 over a wide range .",
    "such systems should be possibly also relevant in a biophysical context ( cylindrical pores in biological membranes , blood vessels or other transport pipes or tube - like objects in biosystems , in which proteins or other biopolymers can be adsorbed ) , but this is outside of consideration here .",
    "rather this paper is devoted to an understanding of the characteristic lengths that describe the configurations of the endgrafted chains in such a cylindrical confinement . in sec .",
    "ii , we formulate a ( somewhat qualitative ) scaling description , pointing out also the relation to the problem of non - adsorbed chains in cylindrical pores at various volume fractions of the monomers @xcite . in sec .",
    "iii , we describe the model used for our simulations to test this theory , while sec .",
    "iv presents our numerical results for the linear dimensions of the chains .",
    "v describes results for the monomer density distribution across the channel , as well as corresponding results for the distribution function for the free chain end .",
    "vi then summarizes our conclusions .",
    "a very brief discussion of polymer brushes in cylindrical geometry was given in appendix c of @xcite , however , many of the characteristic lengths relevant for our study were not given , and also a detailed derivation of the diagram describing the different regimes in the plane of variables r and @xmath2 was not presented ; we give such a justification here , in order to make clear which underlying assumptions are made , and in order to be able to derive the new results on various characteristic lengths that are of interest here .",
    "to set the scene , we recall the `` blob model '' of alexander @xcite and de gennes @xcite and its extension to deal with a nonuniform monomer concentration within a brush @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for simplicity",
    ", all lengths will be measured in units of the effective segment length a , so the end - to - end distance of an ideal ( gaussian ) chain containing n segments simply is @xmath24 , and both grafting density @xmath2 and volume fraction @xmath25 are treated as dimensionless quantities .",
    "only the good solvent regime is treated , and - as usual in the spirit of scaling approaches @xcite - prefactors of order unity are suppressed throughout .",
    "also the exponent @xmath26 describing the linear dimensions of a self - avoiding walk in @xmath27 dimensions is simply approximated at the flory value @xcite @xmath28 , rather taking the more accurate value @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "thus an isolated polymer chain endgrafted at a planar wall , a `` polymer mushroom '' , has the same gyration radii components as in the bulk , @xmath30 here , and in the following , we orient the z - axis normal to the grafting surface while the x and y - axes lie in the grafting plane ( in the case of a a planar brush ) .    considering then grafting densities @xmath2 large enough such that the individual mushrooms would significantly overlap , we recognize that ( for @xmath31 ) we obtain a semidilute polymer brush , in which the screening length @xmath32 is of the order of @xmath33 , which then is taken as the blob - radius in fig .",
    "it is implied , that inside a blob excluded volume statistics persists , only n monomers from one chain are contained inside of such a blob , and no monomers of any other chains . since @xmath34 , in analogy to eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , we conclude that a blob contains @xmath35 monomers , and every chain contains @xmath36 blobs .",
    "according to the alexander @xcite - de gennes @xcite picture , the chains in the brush form `` cigars '' , i.e. they form linear chains of blobs stretched out along the z - axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , upper part ) , and hence the brush height @xmath37 is of the same order as @xmath38 , namely @xmath39 taken literally , this `` cigar '' configuration would imply that @xmath40 , which in reality is not the case : rather the chains in x and y - direction have a structure resulting from a random walk of blobs , i.e. @xmath41 while the alexander @xcite - de gennes @xcite picture also implies that the monomer density profile @xmath42 is essentially uniform for @xmath43 , and the free chain ends are all in the outermost blob , i.e. in the region @xmath44 , the structure in reality is much more complicated @xcite .",
    "rather than staying constant , @xmath45 smoothly decreases with increasing @xmath37 ( and in the strong stretching limit approximately is described by a parabolic variation , @xmath46 $ ] ) . due to this decrease of the monomer fraction @xmath42 with the distance z from the grafting surface ,",
    "also the screening length @xmath32 is not a constant , but increases according to @xmath47^{-3/4}$ ] @xcite . from a self consistency consideration",
    "one can then estimate the diameter @xmath48 of the final blob as @xcite @xmath49 .",
    "all these concepts have been verified by corresponding computer simulations @xcite .",
    "we now consider a cylindrical tube of diameter d and length l. we orient the tube axis in y - direction and choose in this direction periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we first note that there is a simple geometric relation between the grafting density @xmath2 of anchor points at the cylinder surface and the average volume fraction @xmath25 of monomers contained in the cylinder .",
    "since the area of the cylinder surface is @xmath50 , the total number of monomers @xmath51 contained in the cylinder is @xmath52 the cylinder volume being @xmath53 , we find @xmath54 the condition that the maximum volume fraction that can be reached in a cylinder corresponds to a dense melt , i.e. @xmath55 , implies the following constraint for physically meaningful grafting densities @xmath2 @xmath56 we first discuss the regime of extremely low grafting densities .",
    "for wide tubes , @xmath4 , we still have mushrooms , i.e. eq .  ( [ eq1 ] ) still holds .",
    "a more interesting regime occurs for narrow tubes , @xmath57 where the chains form `` cigars '' stretched along the y - axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the situation for @xmath58 closely resembles the case of non - grafted chains confined to very narrow tubes under good solvent conditions @xcite .",
    "one has @xmath59 , while the longitudinal @xmath10-component @xmath60 is much larger . assuming that the `` cigar '' configuration can be treated as an array of @xmath61 blobs of diameter @xmath0 , with @xmath62 monomers per blob , @xmath63 , we readily obtain @xmath64 as it should be , for @xmath65 this yields a smooth crossover to @xmath66 .",
    "next we estimate how small the grafting density @xmath2 has to be in order that eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) or ( [ eq8 ] ) hold , respectively .",
    "the corresponding boundary in the @xmath67 plane is obtained by the condition that the grafting density is such that the mushrooms or cigars just touch each other .    in the case of mushrooms ,",
    "@xmath68 , this boundary is reached for an overlap grafting density @xmath69 given by @xmath70 since each mushroom covers an area of order @xmath71 when one projects the monomer coordinates of the chain onto the grafting surface .    in the case of cigars , elongated along the @xmath10-axis , @xmath12",
    ", we simply have to equate the density @xmath25 in the tube to the density inside a cigar , using eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) @xmath72 this overlap density @xmath73 is easily converted into an overlap grafting density @xmath69 using eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) , @xmath74 also in this case we note that for @xmath65 both expressions eqs .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) , ( [ eq11 ] ) for the overlap grafting density are of the same order , as it should be .",
    "we now consider the behavior for @xmath75 . in the regime where @xmath68",
    "a crossover from mushroom to brush takes place , similar to the case of planar grafting surface . to leading order , eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) still holds .",
    "however , a strong compression of the brush sets in when the brush height @xmath37 ( and thus also @xmath38 ) become comparable to the tube diameter .",
    "this yields a crossover grafting density @xmath76 separating a weakly compressed brush ( described still by eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) ) from a strongly compressed brush , with @xmath77 , for @xmath78 , @xmath79 in the regime of the compressed brush , the density @xmath25 of monomers is approximately uniform throughout the tube .",
    "then the lateral linear dimensions are , similar as for chains in a semidilute solution in the bulk ( @xmath80 , given as @xmath81 at the boundary , @xmath82 , eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) yields linear dimensions of order @xmath83 and hence there occurs then again a smooth crossover to eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "finally , we address the behavior for @xmath75 in the narrow tube regime @xmath12 . while for @xmath84 we have found `` cigars '' ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) as described by eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) that just touch at their ends , we now expect `` compressed cigars '' in which the excluded volume interactions are partially screened .",
    "the polymer chains overlap themselves and near the cigar ends , neighboring cigars overlap each other .",
    "the screening length ( blob radius ) @xmath32 then is smaller than the tube diameter , unlike the situation depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , namely @xmath85 where in the last step eq .",

    "the `` cigars '' are laterally compressed , each chain overlaps itself to some extent ( excluded volume is respected only up to the length @xmath32 , eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) ) , but neighboring chains are still essentially segregated from each other and overlap only near the ends of the `` cigar '' .    now",
    "the boundary @xmath93 of this regime can simply be estimated from the condition that @xmath60 , eq.([eq16 ] ) , equals the result in the compressed brush regime , eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) , which yields @xmath94 note that for @xmath65 this boundary starts at @xmath95 , i.e. it splits off from the boundary @xmath69 in the @xmath96 plane ( fig .",

    "even then difficulties to verify scaling were encountered @xcite .    however , for the brushes in the cylindrical pores good equilibration is significantly more difficult ; therefore we restrict the present work to relatively short chains .    thus , it can not be a surprise that in the scaling plots ( figs .",
    "[ fig7]a , b ) a perfect collapse on master curves is not obtained , and rather some systematic deviations due to corrections to scaling are clearly apparent .",
    "such corrections to scaling are presumably also responsible for the fact that the effective exponents @xmath218 in the mushroom regime of figs .",
    "[ fig6]b , c deviate from their theoretical value .",
    "note also that in the present work a somewhat more restricted range of grafting densities is studied than in @xcite , where much lower grafting densities were included to ensure to reach the mushroom regime fully . our data in fig .",

    "also the problem was discussed that for temperatures not too far from the theta temperature the excluded volume interaction on the scale of a blob diameter may be so weak that then in the regime of high grafting densities inside of a blob gaussian chain statistics still holds . as a consequence ,",

    "however , since the crossovers ( from the mushroom regime to the brush and from the brush to the compressed brush ) do not occur at sharply defined values of @xmath2 , but are rather expected to be smeared out over a range of values @xmath2 that may be a full decade or even more . therefore instead of the two `` kinks '' in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] a smooth gradual increase with @xmath2 is noted .",
    "similarly , when we study @xmath238 as a function of n ( fig.[fig10]c ) , one can still see straight lines on the log - log plot , but the observed effective exponents are somewhere in between @xmath239 and @xmath240 , indicating the onset of compression due to the confinement of the brush in the tube .",
    "however , such effective exponent which simply reflect slow crossovers do lack any deep physical significance , of course .    motivated by the scaling analysis of sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the extent to which the chain length dependence can be absorbed in scaling plots of @xmath127 and @xmath149 versus @xmath129 ( fig .",

    "it is probably not feasible experimentally to graft extremely long chains at the tube walls , we shall not emphasize the comparison with the strong stretching limit of the scf theory in the present paper ; just as the scaling considerations of sec .",
    "2 it is useful for a first orientation , but one can not rely on its quantitative details in the present case .    after this prelude on the density profiles for the well - studied case of polymer brushes grafted to planar substrates we turn to our results on the profiles in cylindrical pores , figs .",
    "[ fig13]-[fig16 ] .",
    "while for short chains ( such as @xmath268 ) and low grafting densities these density profiles are typical of mushroom behavior , for larger @xmath1 one quickly reaches a state where the whole cylindrical brush is more or less uniformly filled with monomers . in this limit",
    "the density of end monomers reaches a maximum near the tube axis , but in comparison with the brushes on flat substrates ( fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ) the distribution of the end monomers is more uniform .",
    "thus the approximation of sevick @xcite assuming a delta - function distribution of chain ends ( like in the alexander @xcite - de gennes @xcite model ) obviously is not accurate , at least for the parameter range accessible in our simulations . at this point",
    "we recall that sevick @xcite predicts that the brush height @xmath37 decreases with increasing inverse cylinder diameter @xmath0 monotonously , while milner and witten @xcite on the basis of their scf theory suggest that the brush height @xmath37 increases with @xmath269 ( for small enough @xmath269 ) .",
    "the interpretation for the latter result is that in the cylindrical pore the blob diameters get smaller with increasing distance z from the grafting surface when @xmath269 increases , since the volume available for the blobs decreases , and hence the tendency of the brush towards stretching is more pronounced in the outer region of a brush in a cylinder than for a brush at a flat substrate .",
    "of course , when h and @xmath270 become comparable , the opposite tendency of compressing the brush due to the confinement will outweigh this increase of h that may be present for small @xmath269 .    again we emphasize that the grafted monomer ( adjacent to the wall of the tube ) is at a fixed distance @xmath271 inside of the atoms forming the walls of the tube , which are at the radial distance @xmath272 from the tube axis .",
    "the sharp spike at @xmath273 in figs .",
    "[ fig13]a , [ fig14]a , [ fig15]a ,    [ fig16]a hence is always a representation of the delta function corresponding to the monomer adjacent to the rigid wall , at this fixed distance @xmath271 inside of it .",
    "however , other monomers of the chain can come closer to the wall , when the chain bends back to the grafting wall .",
    "therefore one finds a nonzero @xmath274 in between @xmath273 and @xmath272 , as is clearly seen in figs .",
    "[ fig13]a and [ fig14]a .    when the chain length @xmath1 is small enough ( and/or the tube diameter @xmath0 is large enough ) , both @xmath275 and @xmath276 are essentially zero for @xmath277 .",

    "however , when either @xmath1 gets larger or @xmath0 gets smaller ( or both ) , these distributions @xmath275 and @xmath276 get nonzero for @xmath277 .",

    "thus the tube axis in the simulation is at @xmath283 , since we arbitrarily defined @xmath273 to be the position of the first monomer and put the wall at the radial distance @xmath272 from the tube axis .",

    "in particular , there is no singular behavior at the center of the tube , at @xmath292 all curves are perfectly smooth .",

    "no evidence for bimodal distributions , that are expected for narrow tubes and long enough chains due to the cigar - like configurations is found for the parameter range investigated , however .",

    "[ fig19 ] where also the monomer density profile for a flat substrate , that is , zero curvature , is displayed .",

    "[ fig19 ] , this effect is seen irrespective of particular grafting density @xmath2 . at",
    "higher @xmath2 , however , one can readily see that beyond a certain chain length ( @xmath299 for @xmath297 , and @xmath300 for @xmath298 ) the ratio @xmath296 reaches a plateau , as expected on the ground of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) whereas for the lower grafting density , @xmath301 , the onset of this scaling behavior probably occurs at much larger chain lengths @xmath1 .",
    "the configurations of flexible polymers endgrafted at the inner walls of cylindrical tubes under good solvent conditions were studied by two complementary approaches , namely by a scaling theory and by monte carlo simulation of a bead - spring model .",
    "the scaling treatment can identify the asymptotic power laws of the chain linear dimensions @xmath302 and @xmath38 and the brush height @xmath37 in terms of the parameters of the problem , namely the chain length @xmath1 , the grafting density @xmath2 , and the tube diameter @xmath0 .",
    "these power laws , however , are valid only asymptotically in the limit @xmath216 , keeping the scaled grafting density @xmath303 and the scaled tube diameter @xmath304 fixed . in this limit , also the scaled linear dimensions @xmath305 and @xmath306 will not exhibit any explicit dependence on @xmath1 any more , but will depend on the scaled variables @xmath129 and @xmath120 only ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , for example ) .",
    "it should be noted , that even in this limit the scaling theory is grossly oversimplified , since the different regimes that have been identified ( mushrooms , cigars ; compressed cigars ; overlapping cigars ; compressed brush ; normal brush ) are not separated by any sharp boundaries , but rather the different power laws that characterize these regimes merge gradually by smooth crossovers .",
    "these crossover regions may extend over several decades of the appropriate control variable ( such as @xmath129 ) .",
    "therefore the lines in the `` state diagram '' of the polymer brush ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) should not be mixed up with lines appearing in a thermodynamic phase diagram : here the lines only mark the center of the crossover region ( fig .  [ fig3 ] ) , and all the kinks in a scaling diagram such as fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] are rounded off .",
    "however , we are not aware of any analytical method that could provide the functions that describe these smooth crossovers .    real polymer brushes confined in such a cylindrical pore geometry will hardly obey these rather stringent conditions under which the scaling considerations are strictly applicable , and the same caveat holds for computer simulations .",
    "nevertheless the scaling approach is useful as a first guidance towards this rather complex behavior .",
    "the monte carlo simulations yield not only the gyration radius components of the chains , but also the full density profiles of the monomers , the distribution function of the chain ends , etc .",
    "it has been found that the chain ends are distributed all over the cylindrical tube , if the monomer density inside the tube gets large .",
    "while for brushes on planar substrates chain end distributions still have a broad maximum located roughly near the brush height , in the cylindrical geometry these distributions are much broader .",
    "it is also remarkable that this distribution spans the full range of radial distances @xmath307 , rather than being restricted only to the region from the grafting point to the cylinder axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , @xmath308 .",
    "our findings imply that theories that approximate the chain end distribution by a delta function @xmath309 can not be trusted .",
    "thus , we identify cases where the brush height in the cylinder increases when the cylinder radius is decreased , in contrast to predictions of such theories .",
    "this means that for smaller @xmath0 we find that the curvature slightly enhances chain stretching in the direction normal to the grafting substrate , but this effect is rather small .    due to technical difficulties of preparing well - equilibrated configurations of polymer brushes in cylindrical pores , only rather short chains could be studied , which do not allow a decisive test of the scaling theory yet .",
    "nevertheless the scaling theory does provide a useful framework to analyze and discuss the monte carlo results .    in future work , we plan to consider transport through such polymer - coated nanopipes .",
