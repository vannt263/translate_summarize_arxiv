    "recently there has been a lot of interest in leptoquarks as a possible explanation @xcite for anomalous b decays observed in babar @xcite , belle @xcite and lhcb @xcite .",
    "of particular interest to us was the claim that the departure from the standard model prediction for b decay could be linked with two other striking anomalies - an observed violation of lepton universality @xcite and the anomalous muon magnetic moment @xcite - and that a single leptoquark could explain all three anomalies without substantial fine tuning @xcite ( aside from of course any mass hierarchies for the higgs and possibly the leptoquark ) .",
    "specifically they chose a single @xmath2 scale leptoquark , @xmath3 , that is a colour triplet and an su(2)@xmath4 singlet with hyper charge @xmath5 .",
    "the correction to the standard model lagrangian due to the existence of this leptoquark is lagrangian @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the standard model higgs doublet .",
    "leptoquarks are known to have problems with proton decay and as such it was suggested that this can be avoided through a discrete symmetry where sm leptons and the leptoquark have opposite parity .",
    "+ leptoquarks are also of theoretical interest as the tend to appear in various grand unified theories ( guts ) .",
    "indeed the particular choice of leptoquark used in ref .",
    "@xcite appears in e@xmath8 guts @xcite .",
    "they have also been proposed as a non - supersymmetric catalyst of gauge coupling unification @xcite and a cause of neutrino masses via radiative corrections @xcite .",
    "these explanations of the neutrino mass are phenomenologically attractive as unlike the see saw mechanism , these models have predictions at much lower energies . + it is of interest to us whether using these leptoquarks to explain these flavour anomalies is compatible with some of these theoretical motivations and if not what is the minimal extension needed for such compatibility .",
    "specifically we look at gauge coupling unification , vacuum stability and the possibility of neutrino masses .",
    "we find first that the the modification to one loop @xmath9 functions are insufficient to achieve unification .",
    "we also find that gauge coupling unification puts contraints on the leptoquark couplings which partly conflict with the constraints on leptoquark coupling given in @xcite as they had @xmath10 which is generically the opposite condition to what gauge coupling unification requires .",
    "one in principle has enough freedom left to achieve gauge coupling unification although this requires some couplings to be brought close to the perturbativity bound .",
    "this makes the calculation susceptible to high theoretical error .",
    "by contrast , vacuum stability is substantially boosted due to the improved running of the higgs quartic coupling when the portal coupling is non - negligible .",
    "this effect is somewhat cancelled at two loop if the leptoquark couplings are large but not enough to make vacuum stability a problem for the model .",
    "finally , there is no way this particular leptoquark can contribute to the neutrino mass .",
    "we explore minimal extensions that do not interfere heavily with the leptoquarks ability to explain the three flavour anomalies , vacuum stability or gauge coupling unification . + the structure of this paper is as follows . in sections [ sec : gut ] and",
    "[ sec : vacuum ] we discuss the modification to the running of the gauge coupling constants and the higgs quartic coupling respectively , thereby discussing the viability of gauge coupling unification and vacuum stability in this model .",
    "we then discuss how compatible these constraints are with collider constraints and the need to simultaneously explain violations of lepton universality , anomalies in @xmath11 decays and the measurement of @xmath1 experiments in section [ sec : pheno ] .",
    "we discuss minimal modifications to achieve neutrino masses aside from the tree level term in section [ sec : neutrino ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ]",
    "when one examines how the three gauge coupling constants of the standard model run , they come close to intersecting at a high energy scale .",
    "it is of course now known that they do not unify without some new physics entering in at a lower scale , typically just above the weak scale .",
    "the leptoquarks change the running of gauge coupling constants and it was first suggested that a weak scale leptoquark could cause gauge coupling unification to manifest in ref .",
    "@xcite and as mentioned in the introduction this has become a major motivation and attraction for considering low scale leptoquarks .",
    "it is therefore of interest whether this is feasible in a model where a leptoquark is used to simultaneously explain flavour anomalies .",
    "the change in the one loop @xmath9 functions changes when one extends the standard model by a leptoquark .",
    "however , we find that this will not lead to unification . to improve the unification of gauge couplings , the leptoquark couplings @xmath12 and @xmath13 effect the beta functions for gauge coupling constants at two loop level as follows @xmath14 + 78 { \\rm tr}[\\lambda",

    "the higgs portal coupling is the major player in achieving a boost to the stability of the vacuum so the two satisfying the two constraints - vacuum stability and gauge coupling unification - are only moderately correlated as we explain in the next section . typically raising",
    "the left handed coupling constants takes one further away from coupling unification whereas raising the right handed coupling gets one closer .",
    "if all left handed couplings are null then gauge coupling unification is achieved when @xmath15 \\sim 3.\\ ] ] this number rises if the left handed leptoquark couplings rises .",
    "+ if the leptoquark is used to explain the apparent violation of lepton universality , it turns out to be difficult to avoid at least one leptoquark coupling being large , namely the @xmath16 coupling .",
    "this raises the required value of the right handed leptoquark coupings .",
    "[ fig : gauge ] shows the running of the gauge couplings for leptoquark couplings chosen to satisfy all phenomenology constraints as well as explaining all three flavour anomalies .",
    "we take all standard model couplings at weak scale and use the standard model rges defined to two loop to run all parameters from the weak scale to the mass of the leptoquark ( which we set to be @xmath17 tev ) using the numerical package sarah @xcite . in principle , there is enough freedom left over from these constraints to achieve gauge coupling unification if some couplings are made sufficiently large .",
    "the results however should be taken with a heavy grain of salt because the running of the leptoquark couplings are such that they increase and approach the perturbativity bound .",
    "therefore the calculation is expected to have a high amount of uncertainty .",
    "if there are multiple generations of leptoquarks this problem is alleviated .    )",
    "achieved via strong right handed leptoquark couplings . with a single generation",
    "the couplings get precariously close to the perturbativity bound , a problem accentuated if one wishes to explain a violation in lepton univerality , adding in a great deal of theoretical uncertainty which can be alleviated with extra generations of leptoquarks . ]",
    "this is compatible with low energy phenomology as well as explaining anomalies in the value of @xmath1 , b decays and violation of lepton universality . ]    the recent discovery of a higgs like boson at @xmath18 gev @xcite has led to the realization that the standard model vacuum is likely metastable @xcite .",
    "this is because the higgs quartic coupling becomes negative at large energy scales .",
    "this has motivated research on how to improve the stability of the electroweak vacuum through addition to the standard model .",
    "there are two ways of getting a boost improve the stability of the vacuum    * improved running through corrections to the standard model rges .",
    "this has been done numerously in singlet extensions to the standard model @xcite * extended scalar sector , for adding a real singlet that acquires a vacuum expectation value .",
    "the result can be that the higgs quartic coupling can be larger than its standard model value @xcite .",
    "the leptoquark can not have a vacuum expectation value at zero temperature so the only option is through improved running . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first paper to investigate this possibility with leptoquarks .",
    "the beta functions for the higgs quartic coupling will get a correction compared to the standard model which we denote @xmath19 and @xmath20 for one and two loop contributions respectively . the one loop correction to the standard model rge for the higgs quartic coupling receives contributions from the portal coupling only @xmath21 note that the one loop correction is positive which makes a boost to stability possible in the first place .",
    "so if the portal coupling is large then the leptoquark contributes to improving the stability of the vacuum .",
    "the two loop correction can be significant enough to justify a careful analysis .",
    "for the sake of simplicity the leptoquark coupling to one generation dominates .",
    "this is simply to show the structure of the two loop beta functions more clearly - our numerical calculations consider all generations .",
    "we can then write the dominant contribution as @xmath22 typically this is strongly negative if the leptoquark couplings are large which drives up the value of @xmath23 needed to make the higgs quartic coupling remain non - negative up to the unification scale . to achieve gauge coupling unification with all left handed leptoquark couplings set to zero ,",
    "right handed leptoquark couplings need to be large . also , one of the left handed leptoquark coupling constants has to be quite large to explain the violation of lepton universality .",
    "this means that several right handed leptoquark couplings have to be quite large to make gauge coupling unification manifest which pushes up the required value of @xmath24 to a moderate value . in fig .",
    "[ fig : stability ] we again the numerical package sarah @xcite to run standard model parameters up to the scale of the leptoquark mass ( which we choose to be @xmath17 tev ) and then run all parameters including the leptoquark parameters up to the a high scale . for a value of @xmath25",
    "the higgs quartic coupling never goes negative .",
    "in this section we consider the constraints on the parameter space due to both collider constraints and the proposal to have such a leptoquark explaining the afore mentioned anomalies .",
    "all the constraints in this section will be on the leptoquark couplings and its mass .",
    "there are no constraints on the portal coupling crucial for boosting the vacuum stability by improving the running of the higgs quartic coupling .",
    "this means that , absent very large leptoquark couplings , vacuum stability is by default compatible with leptoquarks explaining these three anomalies .",
    "let us begin by cataloguing the constraints from the anomalies .",
    "the constraints are written in terms of the leptoquark couplings written in the mass basis . to convert from the mass basis to the weak basis",
    "we make use of both the ckm matrix and the pmns matrix as well as the relations @xmath26 we will begin with the requirement that the leptoquark provide an explanation for anomalous b decays which gives the following condition on the leptoquark couplings @xmath27 these constraints cause two left handed couplings to be around @xmath28 and the right handed coupling @xmath29 about @xmath30 .",
    "since we require the trace of the right handed leptoquark coupling matrix to be significantly larger than the trace of the left handed leptoquark matrix this already constrains the parameter space somewhat .",
    "next we turn to the anomalous measurement of @xmath1 .",
    "this leads to the condition @xmath31 this does not put much constraint on the right handed couplings as we can just tune the left handed couplings down .",
    "the apparent violation of lepton universality , by contrast , puts the most severe constraint on the parameters as it inevitably leads to some coupling constants being large .",
    "specifically the constraints are @xmath32 the second constraint is straightforward to satisfy because it requires that the sum of a set of left handed couplings must come to the small value of @xmath33 which is consistent with gauge coupling unification . combining this with the first constraint though says that the square of two couplings , @xmath34 must add to about @xmath35 .",
    "this is obviously impossible to satisfy without making at least one of these couplings very large .",
    "it can be more dangerous phenomenologically to have large leptoquark couplings to first generation quarks or leptons , so in reality this will lead to the coupling @xmath36 for a leptoquark mass of around a tev .",
    "this puts a very sharp constraint on the ability of this leptoquark to simultaneously give rise to gauge coupling unification and explain the apparent violation of lepton universality .",
    "note that only the violation of lepton univerality requires a condition that conflicts with gauge coupling unification .",
    "let us next turn our attention to the phenomological constraints .",
    "we can get constraints on the leptoquark mass from reference @xcite .",
    "the lower bound for leptoquarks that decay into bottom quarks is @xmath37 gev and the lower bound for leptoquarks decaying into muons with a significant branching ratio is @xmath38 gev .",
    "the latter bound is more relevant if one is indeed desiring to explain an observed violation of lepton universality . for convenience we will catalogue all other relevant collider constraints in a single list @xmath39 ^{1/2 }",

    "last is a bound on the branching ratio of @xmath44    the constraint from the @xmath40 and @xmath41 decays put no constraints on right handed couplings but can be satisfied with arbitrarily small left handed couplings .",
    "the constraint from the branching ratio of @xmath42 forces one @xmath45 to be small .",
    "it is satisfied if the left handed couplings are very small , the right handed couplings if they are equal can be @xmath46 .",
    "note that lepton universality means that the @xmath47 coupling has to be @xmath48 which is fine if @xmath49 is small .",
    "the constraints due to the partial width of @xmath43 leads to no constraint on the right handed couplings but is satisfied for arbitrarily small left handed couplings .",
    "lepton universality requires that @xmath50 left handed coupling to be large , @xmath51 , but this is compatible with the constraint so long as other left handed couplings appearing in the constraint are suppressed which we desire anyway .",
    "the last constraint due to the branching ratio of @xmath44 is the most dangerous if one desires the addition of a tev scale leptoquark to lead to gauge coupling unification .",
    "there is a relative sign in the equation which means in principle that one can find a fine tuned region to the the parameter space where a fortuitous cancellation occurs .",
    "but let us concentrate on the non - fine tuned region of parameter space .",
    "recalling that the apparent violation of lepton universality leads to @xmath52 , this leads to @xmath53 and @xmath54 needing to be have a value of approximately @xmath55 .",
    "so we have 7 right handed couplings set to be small in principle .",
    "however , a loophole is just to set 3 of them to be very small . to give maximum freedom set right handed @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 to be small as well as @xmath59",
