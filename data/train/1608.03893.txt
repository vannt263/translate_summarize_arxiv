    "supermassive black holes are now believed to inhabit the nuclei of all massive galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the active galactic nucleus , or agn , phase is generally understood to be a short - term event in the life of a typical black hole , triggered either by a merger event or secular processes in the host galaxy ( cf .",
    "the review of @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "tight scaling relationships between the observed properties of black holes and their host galaxies point to a symbiotic relationship between the two ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in which the growth of structure and the evolution of galaxies across cosmic time is fundamentally linked to supermassive black holes . understanding this link requires an understanding of black hole demographics , not just in the local universe , but also at higher redshift where we can witness the growth of structure occurring .",
    "black holes , as opposed to galaxies , are incredibly simple objects that can be fully characterized with only two fundamental measurements : mass and spin . in the milky way , years of astrometric monitoring of stars in the central @xmath8parsec have led to an extremely precise determination of the mass of our own supermassive black hole @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , all other galaxies are too distant for this same technique to be employed , and different techniques must be used to understand the masses of a population of central black holes . for galaxies out to @xmath9mpc , spatially - resolved observations of the bulk motions of stars or nuclear gas disks can be combined with dynamical modeling to constrain the central black hole mass ( cf .",
    "the reviews of @xcite ) .",
    "reverberation mapping @xcite , on the other hand , takes advantage of agn flux variability to constrain black hole masses through time - resolved , rather than spatially - resolved , observations , thus obviating any distance limitations .",
    "furthermore , the most widely - used technique to constrain supermassive black hole spins requires high x - ray luminosities that are only found in agns ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , so the study of active black holes is an important key to unraveling the growth and evolution of cosmic structure .",
    "unfortunately , bright agns are relatively rare in the local universe , leading to a disconnect in our current understanding of nearby black holes compared to those observed at larger look - back times .",
    "in particular , we are lacking direct comparisons of black hole mass constraints through multiple independent techniques in the same galaxies .",
    "there are a handful of published comparisons of reverberation masses and gas dynamical masses ( e.g. , @xcite ) , including the low - mass seyfert ngc4395 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the agreement is generally quite good , although the number of galaxies studied is small .",
    "stellar dynamics , on the other hand , is a good check against reverberation masses because it relies on modeling a non - collisional system , unlike gas dynamics where the agn may be expected to inject energy on resolvable spatial scales .",
    "however , only two such comparisons currently exist for black hole masses from reverberation mapping and stellar dynamical modeling : ngc4151 @xcite and ngc3227 @xcite .",
    "while the techniques give roughly consistent masses for these two examples , there are caveats and limitations to both reverberation mapping and dynamical modeling , and a larger comparison sample is needed to fully assess the consistency of the local and the cosmological black hole mass scales .",
    "we have therefore undertaken a program to identify and monitor local agns where it might be possible to obtain both a reverberation and a stellar dynamical mass constraint .",
    "both techniques are time- and resource - intensive , and there are very few broad - lined agns within @xmath10 , where the spatial resolution provided by @xmath11-m class telescopes would be likely to resolve the black hole s gravitational influence on the nuclear stellar dynamics , but we hope to increase the sample of mass comparisons by a factor of a few .",
    "we currently have stellar dynamical modeling underway for two other local agns , and we describe here the reverberation results for an additional local agn in our sample , ugc06728 .",
    "ugc06728 is a low - luminosity seyfert 1 located at @xmath1211:45:16.0 , @xmath1379:40:53 , @xmath14 in a late - type galaxy that is highly inclined to our line of sight .",
    "it was monitored nightly over the course of two months in the spring of 2015 .",
    "optical spectroscopy and photometry were obtained at apache point observatory in new mexico , with additional supporting photometry obtained at hard labor creek observatory in georgia .",
    "we describe the details below .",
    "spectrophotometric monitoring of ugc06728 was carried out at apache point observatory ( apo ) with the 3.5-m telescope from 2015 april 15 @xmath15 may 30 ( ut dates here and throughout ) .",
    "our monitoring program was scheduled for the first hour of almost every night during this time period , coincident with evening twilight .",
    "we employed the dual imaging spectrograph ( dis ) , which uses a dichroic to split the incoming beam into a red arm and a blue arm , with the low - resolution ( b400/r300 ) gratings centered at 4398  and 7493 .",
    "the b400 and r300 gratings , when used together , cover the entire optical bandpass between the atmospheric cutoff and 1@xmath16 m , with a nominal dispersion of 1.8 / pix and 2.3 / pix respectively .",
    "spectra were obtained through a 5  slit rotated to a position angle of 0(oriented north - south ) and centered on the agn . on each visit ,",
    "a single spectrum with an exposure time of 600s was acquired at a typical airmass of 1.5 .",
    "observations of the spectrophotometric standard star feige34 were also acquired with each visit .",
    "all spectra were reduced with iraf following standard procedures .",
    "an extraction width of 12pixels was adopted , corresponding to an angular width of 5  and 4.8  for the blue and red cameras , respectively .",
    "the desire to minimize sampling gaps and maximize temporal coverage means that ground - based reverberation campaigns must rely on spectroscopy obtained under nonphotometric conditions . while a spectrophotometric standard star can help correct the overall shape of the spectrum for atmospheric effects , as well as those from the telescope and instrument optics , an additional technique is required to achieve absolute flux calibrations of all the spectra .",
    "fortuitously , the narrow emission lines do not vary on short timescales of weeks to months , so they can serve as convenient `` internal '' flux calibration sources .",
    "we utilize the @xcite spectral scaling method , which accounts for small differences in wavelength calibration , flux calibration , and resolution ( from variations in the seeing ) .",
    "the method compares each spectrum to a reference spectrum built from the best spectra ( identified by the user ) and minimizes the differences within a specified wavelength range .",
    "the method has been shown to result in relative spectrophotometry that is accurate to @xmath17% @xcite .",
    "we restricted the scaling algorithm to focus on the spectral region containing the [ ] @xmath184959,5007 doublet .",
    "additionally , we adopted an overall flux scale based on the integrated [ ] @xmath19 flux measured from the nights with the best observing conditions of @xmath20ergss@xmath5@xmath21 .",
    "the red - side spectra showed only h@xmath22 emission smoothly blended with [ ] @xmath186548,6583 .",
    "emission from [ ] @xmath186716,6730 and [ ] @xmath186300,6363 is extremely weak and difficult to detect above the continuum . with no suitable narrow lines available ,",
    "we were unable to accurately intercalibrate the red - side spectra and we do not consider them further .    figure  [ fig : mean.rms ] displays the final mean and root mean square ( rms ) of all the calibrated spectra acquired throughout the campaign .",
    "the rms spectrum displays the variable spectral components , of which h@xmath0 , @xmath234686 , and h@xmath24 are apparent , as is the agn continuum .",
    "broad - band @xmath25 and @xmath26 images were obtained at apo with the imaging mode of the dis spectrograph each night directly after acquiring the spectra .",
    "the dual - arm nature of the spectrograph allowed both images to be obtained simultaneously .",
    "the typical exposure time was 30s , and a single image in each filter was obtained per visit .",
    "images were reduced in iraf following standard procedures .",
    "the dis imaging mode provides a relatively small field of view ( @xmath27@xmath287 ) , but there were a handful of convenient bright stars in all of the images ( see figure  [ fig : apo.r ] ) .",
    "we carried out aperture photometry employing circular apertures with radii of 378 in @xmath25 and 36 in @xmath26 , and sky annuli of 63@xmath15756 and 60@xmath1572 respectively .",
    "calibrated @xmath29 and @xmath30band magnitudes for three field stars were adopted from apass ( the aavso photometric all sky survey ; @xcite ) and set the photometric zeropoints .",
    "photometric monitoring was also carried out with the 24-inch miller telescope at hard labor creek observatory ( hlco ) , owned and operated by georgia state university in hard labor creek state park near rutledge , ga .",
    "@xmath31band images were acquired with an apogee @xmath32 detector , spanning a field of view of @xmath33 with a pixel scale of @xmath34 . on a typical night",
    ", three exposures were obtained at an airmass of @xmath35 , each with an exposure time of 300s .",
    "the wide field of view of the hlco images included a large number of field stars , allowing us to derive a @xmath31band light curve for ugc06728 by employing image subtraction techniques .",
    "we first registered all the images to a common alignment with the sexterp package @xcite .",
    "we then carried out the image subtraction analysis with the isis package @xcite .",
    "isis builds a reference frame from the best images ( specified by the user ) and then uses a spatially - varying kernel to convolve the reference frame to match each individual image in the dataset .",
    "subtraction of the two results in a residual image in which all constant components have disappeared and only variable flux remains . in the case of ugc06728 ,",
    "the host - galaxy and the average agn brightness are subtracted from all the residual images , leaving behind only the brightness of the agn relative to its mean level .",
    "aperture photometry is then employed to measure this variable flux , which may be positive or negative , at the location of the target of interest in each residual image , providing a @xmath31band residual light curve .",

    "all of the time delays measured for ugc06728 are very short , which is to be expected given the low luminosity of the agn .",
    "the time delays determined for h@xmath0 are the only ones that are not formally consistent with zero within the measurement uncertainties , so h@xmath0 is the only emission line we will consider for the determination of the black hole mass .",
    "however , h@xmath0 is also the emission line for which we have the largest number of reverberation results ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a recent summary ) , so it is also the most reliable emission line for determining @xmath280 .",
    "the black hole mass is generally determined from reverberation - mapping measurements as : @xmath281 where @xmath282 is the time delay for a specific emission line relative to variations in the continuum , and @xmath113 is the line - of - sight velocity width of the emission line , with @xmath283 and @xmath284 being the speed of light and gravitational constants , respectively .",
    "the emission - line time delay is interpreted as a measure of the responsivity - weighted average radius of the broad - line region for that specific emission feature ( e.g. , h@xmath0 ) .",
    "the scaling factor @xmath285 accounts for the detailed geometry and kinematics of the broad line region gas , which is unresolvable . in practice ,",
    "the multiplicative factor , @xmath286 , which is found to bring the @xmath7  relationship for agns with reverberation masses into agreement with the @xmath7  relationship for nearby galaxies with dynamical black hole masses ( e.g. , @xcite ) is used as a proxy for @xmath285 . in this way , the population average factor provides an overall scale for reverberation masses that should be unbiased , but the mass of any particular agn is expected to be uncertain by a factor of 2 - 3 because of object - to - object variations .",
    "the value of @xmath287 has varied in the literature from 5.5 @xcite to 2.8 @xcite , depending on which objects are included and the specifics of the measurements .",
    "we adopt the value determined by @xcite of @xmath288 .    combining the time lag ( @xmath241 ) and line width ( @xmath261 ) measurements for h@xmath0 and",
    "scaling by @xmath286 , we determine @xmath289m@xmath3 .",
    "the extremely rapid response of the broad emission lines to variations in the continuum flux in ugc06728 means that our daily sampling was not fine enough to resolve time delays for all the broad optical recombination lines .",
    "the time delay of h@xmath0 is the only one that is not formally consistent with zero delay , and it is only marginally resolved at that .",
    "however , while we were not able to resolve the time delays for h@xmath24 and , we can examine them in light of the expected virial relationship for blr gas that is under the gravitational dominance of the black hole .",
    "in particular , we would expect that @xmath290 .",
    "this relationship has been shown to be a good description of observations when reverberation results from multiple emission lines have been recovered ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : rv ] shows the measurements for the optical recombination lines in ugc06728 , with the expected relationship scaled to match the measurements for h@xmath0 .",
    "there is generally good agreement with the expected relationship within the measurement uncertainties , such that we would not expect to resolve the responses of these emission lines with our current sampling .",
    "a monitoring campaign with finer temporal resolution ( @xmath291days ) would be needed to further improve upon these constraints .",
    "furthermore , we can examine the location of ugc06728 on the agn @xmath6  relationship to further assess the h@xmath0 time delay measurement .",
    "for very nearby galaxies like ugc06728 , however , one complication is the large fraction of host - galaxy starlight that contributes to the continuum emission at rest - frame 5100  through the large spectroscopic slit ( @xmath292 ) employed in a reverberation mapping campaign .",
    "the usual method to correct for this contamination is to carry out two - dimensional surface brightness modeling of a high - resolution image of the galaxy ( usually from the _ hubble space telescope _ to maximize the image quality ) , thereby isolating the host - galaxy starlight components from the unresolved agn point source . using the modeling results to create an",
    "`` agn - free '' image allows the starlight contribution to be directly constrained @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , there are no _ hst _ images of ugc06728 .",
    "the highest resolution optical images available are the apo dis @xmath29band images discussed above , with a pixel scale of @xmath293/pixel . while hardly comparable to the quality afforded by _ hst _",
    ", the dis images do allow us to place some rough constraints on the starlight contribution to the flux density at @xmath111 .",
    "we aligned and stacked several of the @xmath29band images to increase the signal - to - noise in the combined image . using the two - dimensional surface brightness fitting program galfit @xcite",
    ", we created a model of the point spread function ( psf ) of the stacked image by fitting multiple gaussian components to the profile of a field star in a restricted portion of the image .",
    "we then employed this model psf while fitting the full frame , including a background sky gradient , a psf for the agn and the nearby star , an exponential profile for the disk of the galaxy , and a srsic  profile for the bulge .",
    "the bulge profile , in particular , is very compact with a half - light radius of 1.7pix ( 0.7 ) , and likely degenerate with the agn psf , so we caution that our estimate of the starlight contribution is probably more like a lower limit .",
    "figure  [ fig : galfit ] displays a 25@xmath2825 region of the stacked @xmath29band image , our best - fit model from galfit , and the residuals after subtracting the model from the image .",
    "as described earlier , calibrated @xmath29band photometry for three field stars from apass ( the aavso photometric all sky survey ; @xcite ) was used to set the overall flux scale of the image .",
    "we also account for a slight flux scaling factor , due to the difference in effective wavelength of the @xmath25 filter compared to @xmath111 , using synphot and a template galaxy bulge spectrum @xcite .",
    "our estimate of the host - galaxy contribution to the spectroscopic flux density is @xmath294ergss@xmath5@xmath21@xmath5 . removing this contribution results in an agn - only continuum flux density of @xmath295ergss@xmath5@xmath21@xmath5 . assuming a luminosity distance of @xmath296mpc and correcting for galactic absorption along the line of sight @xcite",

    "the agreement between ugc06728 and its expected location based on its estimated luminosity is extremely good considering the barely - resolved nature of the time delay and the caveats in the luminosity determination .",
    "furthermore , we can expect that the agreement is actually somewhat better than depicted , given the likelihood that the starlight correction to the luminosity is underestimated as described above .",
    "taking our galaxy decomposition at face value , we can estimate the bulge - to - total ratio as @xmath298 , which suggests that the hubble type of the galaxy is @xmath299sb @xcite .",
    "we also estimate the color of the galaxy as @xmath300 , which suggests @xmath301 @xcite .",
    "the total stellar mass of the galaxy is @xmath302m@xmath3 , which also agrees with the host - galaxy being sb@xmath15sc in type .      to further explore the reverberation results for ugc06728 within the context of the larger reverberation sample , we obtained supplemental observations on 2016 may 13 with the dis spectrograph on the apo 3.5-m telescope with the intent of constraining the bulge stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "the high resolution b1200 and r1200 gratings were employed , providing nominal dispersions of 0.62 / pix and 0.58 / pix and wavelength coverages of 1240  and 1160 , respectively .",
    "the blue grating was centered at 4900  to target the mg@xmath303 stellar absorption signature , and the red grating was centered at 8500  for the triplet absorption .",
    "the @xmath304 slit was rotated to a position angle of 150  east of north , approximately along the minor axis of the galaxy .",
    "given the high inclination of the galaxy , we specifically avoided the major axis of the galaxy to mitigate the effects of rotational broadening from the disk within the one - dimensional extracted spectra .",
    "two 1200s exposures were obtained through patchy clouds and with marginal seeing at an airmass of 1.6 .",
    "spectra of the standard star , feige34 , were also obtained to assist with the flux calibration , as well as spectra of hd125560 ( spectral type k3iii ) and hd117876 ( spectral type g8iii ) to provide velocity templates with the same wavelength coverage and dispersion as the galaxy .",
    "all spectra were reduced with iraf following standard procedures .",
    "an extraction width of 40pixels ( corresponding to 16  on the blue camera and 16.8  on the red camera ) was adopted to maximize the galaxy signal in the resultant spectra .",
    "following flux calibration of the spectra , we employed the ppxf ( penalized pixel fitting ) method of @xcite to extract the stellar kinematics .",
    "the mg@xmath303 absorption signature was not detected in the galaxy spectra , but the triplet features were detected , so we focused on fitting the red spectra only . during the fitting process , we restricted the wavelength region to 8525@xmath158850  and determined the best - fit parameters ( velocity , velocity dispersion , h3 , and h4 ) using first one velocity template star and then the other .",
    "the best fits to the spectrum of ugc06728 are displayed in figure  [ fig : veldisp ] : hd125560 ( red line ) provided a best - fit velocity dispersion of 56.5kms@xmath5 , and hd117876 ( blue line ) provided a best fit of 46.7kms@xmath5 .",
    "we take the average of these as the bulge stellar velocity dispersion , @xmath4kms@xmath5 .    with this constraint on the bulge stellar velocity dispersion in ugc06728",
    ", we can explore its location on the agn @xmath7  relationship .",
    "figure  [ fig : msig ] displays the agn @xmath7  relationship from @xcite ( open points and line ) , with the location of ugc06728 shown by the filled circle .",
    "the scatter at the low - mass end of the @xmath7  relationship for agns with reverberation masses seems to be much smaller than that found for megamaser host galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite also found the megamaser host galaxies to have a high scatter relative to the @xmath305  and @xmath306  relationships .",
    "each sample of direct black hole masses , whether dynamical , reverberation , or masering , has its own set of biases and assumptions that are independent of the other techniques , so further exploration into this apparent disagreement is likely to shed light on the reliability of black hole mass measurements as they are currently applied .",
    "furthermore , we can estimate the black hole sphere of influence ( @xmath307 ) in the nucleus of ugc06728 .",
    "generally defined as @xmath308 @xmath307 is often employed as a convenient metric for determining the probability of success for constraining @xmath280 from spatially resolved stellar dynamics .",
    "@xcite argue that a strict reliance on resolving @xmath307 is not necessary , however , for useful constraints on black hole masses .",
    "combining our measurements of @xmath280 and @xmath309 and again assuming a luminosity distance of @xmath310mpc , we estimate @xmath311  for ugc06728 .",
    "while this angular size is smaller than the achievable spatial resolution of integral field spectrographs on the largest ground - based telescopes today , it is interesting to note that it is not much smaller than @xmath307 for ngc3227 . @xcite",
    "were able to constrain the black hole mass of ngc3227 through stellar dynamical modeling , even though the reverberation mass and bulge stellar velocity dispersion predict @xmath312 .",
    "given the very limited number of agns where it will be possible to carry out a direct comparison of reverberation - based and stellar dynamical - based black hole mass measurements with current and near - future technology , ugc06728 could potentially be a worthwhile target for dynamical modeling .",
    "@xcite analyzed _ suzaku _ observations of ugc06728 and determined that it was a `` bare '' agn , with minimal intrinsic absorption .",
    "fitting the x - ray spectrum with a relativistic reflection model , and assuming an accretion disk inclination of @xmath313 , they determined a dimensionless spin parameter of @xmath314 , indicating the black hole is spinning rapidly .",
    "combined with our mass contraint of @xmath2m@xmath3 , ugc06728 is one of a small number of massive black holes that are completely characterized . a few other low - mass black holes have both mass and spin constraints , and they appear to agree with the properties derived for ugc06728 .",
    "mcg-06 - 30 - 15 is only slightly more massive with @xmath315m@xmath3 @xcite and is spinning near maximally ( @xmath316 ; @xcite ) .",
    "ngc4051 is another example , with @xmath317m@xmath3 @xcite and @xmath318 @xcite .",
    "black hole evolutionary models have only recently begun to treat black hole spin in addition to mass . depending on the model , it is not clear if the properties of the black hole in ugc06728 are expected or surprising .",
    "for example , the model of @xcite predicts that black holes with @xmath319m@xmath3 in gas - rich galaxies at @xmath320 ( including agns ) should have slowly rotating black holes with dimensionless spin parameters of @xmath321 .",
    "this model is based on many observational constraints , including the @xmath7  relationship , with which we have shown ugc06728 to be in agreement .",
    "one caveat to the evolutionary model of @xcite is that it does not account for black hole feeding through disk instabilities , which could be a reason for the apparent discrepancy here .",
    "disk instability accretion events would likely be correlated and serve to spin up a black hole .",
    "the evolutionary models of @xcite attempt to include this effect by linking the gas dynamics of the extended galaxy to the central black hole .",
    "their models predict that local black holes with @xmath322m@xmath3 should tend to be spinning near maximally , and that _ accreting _ black holes in spiral galaxies should also tend to have near - maximal spins .",
    "interpretation of black hole spin measurements is still somewhat debated as well .",
    "@xcite argue that black hole spins tend to be overestimated in many cases , although they state this is likely not the case for the most maximally spinning black holes ( @xmath323 ) . furthermore , there is a very strong selection bias inherent in the sample of agns with spin measurements .",
    "rapidly spinning black holes have significant boosts to their x - ray flux through increased radiative efficiency , and the current sample of agns with spin constraints is based on observations of the brightest x - ray sources , so the current sample will strongly favor rapidly spinning black holes @xcite . in any case , ugc06728 is an important addition to the sample . as the least massive central black hole that has been fully described",
    ", it will help to anchor future studies , both observational and theoretical , of central black hole demographics .",
    "we present an h@xmath0 time delay and a reveberation - based black hole mass for the nearby , low - luminosity seyfert ugc06728 . with @xmath324days and @xmath289m@xmath3 ,",
    "ugc06728 is at the low end of observed properties within the reverberation mapping sample .",
    "the time delay and estimated agn luminosity agree with the @xmath6  relationship for other reveberation - mapped agns , and a measurement of @xmath325kms@xmath5 from long - slit spectroscopy shows that the black hole mass agrees with the agn @xmath7  relationship . with @xmath326m@xmath3 , ugc06728 is currently the lowest - mass central black hole that is fully described by both direct mass and spin constraints .",
