    "many candidates of massive astrophysical compact halo objects ( machos ) are being detected by the macho ( alcock et al .",
    "1993 , 1996a ) , eros ( aubourg et al .  1993 , 1995 ) , ogle ( udalski et al .  1992 , 1994 ) , and duo ( alard 1996 ) groups . to maximize the event rate ,",
    "the searches are being carried out toward very dense star fields , e.g. , the galactic bulge and magellanic clouds , in which the detection limit is set by crowding .",
    "however , it is possible to detect a lensing event with a source star that is below the detection limit , and thus unresolved , provided that the star is located in the seeing disk of a bright star and is gravitationally amplified .",
    "this effect is known as `` amplification bias '' ( blanford & narayan 1992 ; narayan & wallington 1994 ) .",
    "i will call events of this type and the corresponding source stars below the detection limit `` faint events '' and `` faint stars '' , respectively .",
    "current lensing experiments are adopting an observational strategy in which they construct templates of resolved stars to allow fast photometric comparison of source star luminosities .",
    "it may then appear as if faint events can not be detected because they are not registered in the template ( bouquet 1993 ) .",
    "however , in the very dense field in which nearly all stars are blended , the amplified flux of a faint star will increase the flux of a nearby bright star , and thus an event seemingly with the bright star as a source star can be detected .",
    "i will call the stars registered in the template image `` bright stars '' as opposed to `` faint stars '' . therefore , the current lensing searches suffer from amplification bias ( nemiroff 1994 ) .    in this paper , using a well - constrained luminosity function ( lf )",
    "i show that @xmath0 of events detected toward the galactic bulge are affected by amplification bias and that the optical depth might be overestimated by a factor @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , i show that by taking amplification bias into consideration , the observed time scale distribution matches significantly better , especially in the short time - scale region , with the distribution expected from a mass spectrum model in which the lenses are composed of the known stellar population plus an additional population of brown dwarfs than it does without taking account of amplification bias .",
    "for the detection of a faint event with a faint star flux @xmath2 , the amplification should satisfy the condition @xmath3 resulting in the minimum required amplification of @xmath4 here @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the fluxes of the blended bright star and the detection limit .",
    "the factor @xmath7 in above equations is included so that an event can be detected when it is amplified more than @xmath8 of the combined flux of the bright and faint stars .",
    "the amplification is related to the lensing parameters by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the lens - source separation in units of the einstein ring radius @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the impact parameter , @xmath13 is the time of maximum amplification .",
    "the einstein ring radius is related to the physical parameters of a lens by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the mass of the lens , and @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are the distances between the observer , lens , and source .",
    "the einstein time scale is related to @xmath11 by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the transverse speed of the lens relative to the observer - source line of sight .",
    "the maximum allowed impact parameter for detection is related to the minimum required amplification by @xmath21^{1/2}. \\eqno(2.5)\\ ] ] for faint events , one can detect only the portion of a light curve above the threshold @xmath22 and the event therefore mimics that of a shorter time - scale event . then what is measured is not @xmath23 but the effective time scale @xmath24 , which is the half of the duration of an event above the threshold .",
    "the ratio between these two time scales is @xmath25^{1/2 } \\le 1.0 .",
    "\\eqno(2.6)\\ ] ]",
    "due to amplification bias , each individual bright star works effectively as multiple source stars .",
    "let @xmath26 the effective number of source stars per single bright star : amplification bias factor .",
    "this factor is computed by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the lf of galactic bulge stars normalized to the area of the seeing disk around each bright star .",
    "the average seeing of the current experiments is @xmath29 .",
    "however , when a faint source is located at the edge of the seeing disk of the bright star , one can isolate its magnified image from the bright star .",
    "i therefore set the undistinguishable separation between images at @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath28 is normalized for stars in the area @xmath31 . in equation ( 3.1 )",
    "the value @xmath32 is included because only events with @xmath33 can be detected .",
    "in addition , the factor @xmath34 enters because the detection efficiency , @xmath35 , decreases as the time scale decreases . for the moment",
    "i assume that the efficiency is linearly proportional to the time scale .",
    "the adopted values of @xmath36 and the functional form @xmath37 is subject to some uncertainties , so i will discuss other cases in ",
    "then the total effective number of source stars is obtained by integrating @xmath38 for all bright source stars weighted by the lf ; @xmath39 @xmath40 the first and second terms in equation ( 3.2 ) are the number of bright stars in the seeing disk and the additional faint stars that effectively work as source stars due to the amplification bias effect , respectively .",
    "the model lf is constructed as follows . for stars brighter than the de - reddened @xmath41-band mag of @xmath42 ,",
    "i adopt the lf determined by j.  frogel ( 1996 , private communication ) , and in the range @xmath43 , i use the lf determined by light et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . to extend the lf beyond even this limit ,",
    "i adopt the lf of stars in the solar neighborhood determined by gould , bahcall , & flynn ( 1996 ) .",
    "i address below the uncertainty caused by the difference in the bulge and disk stellar populations .",
    "i adopt a distance @xmath44 to the galactic bulge stars .",
    "the model lf is presented in figure 1 in units of @xmath45 .",
    "current experiments reach the detection limit when the stellar number density of galactic bulge fields arrives at @xmath46 ( c.  alcock 1996 , private communication ) .",
    "based on the model lf this number density corresponds to @xmath47 or @xmath48 .    with the model lf and the corresponding detection limit ,",
    "the amplification bias factor @xmath26 is computed by equation ( 3.1 ) along with equations ( 2.2 ) , ( 2.5 ) , and ( 2.6 ) .",
    "will spread smoothly over the seeing disk and it will be subtacted during image process .",
    "some stars just below @xmath5 that are located in the seeing disk will cause the threshold to be higher . on the other hand ,",
    "stars that are near but not inside the seeing disk will make the bright star appear fainter and so cause a lower threshold . to lowest order , these two effects cancel one another . ] the resultant values of @xmath26 are shown as a function of bright star mag @xmath49 in figure 2 . because the lf increases as @xmath5 decreases , combined with the fact that the most probable faint events have unamplified faint - star flux just below @xmath5 , the value @xmath26 increases as @xmath5 decreases .",
    "since the event rate is directly proportional to the number of source stars , the average increase in event rate due to the amplification bias effect is determined by @xmath50 resulting in @xmath51 .",
    "that is , on average each source star works effectively as @xmath1 stars , and thus the event rate increases by the same factor .",
    "the distribution of faint source - star brightness for a given template star with a flux @xmath5 is obtained by taking the derivative of @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath52 note that @xmath53 .",
    "the distributions @xmath54 for bright stars with @xmath55 are shown in the left panel of figure 3 .",
    "the total event distribution for all bright stars is computed by @xmath56 @xmath57 , \\eqno(3.5)\\ ] ] where the first and second terms represent the event rate distribution without and with the amplification bias effect , respectively .",
    "when the amplification bias effect is not included , the distribution is just proportional to the lf , i.e. , only the first term .",
    "the total event distribution is shown in the right panel of figure 3 , in which the contribution to the distribution by faint events are shaded .",
    "the faint events comprises @xmath0 of the total events and the unamplified mag of faint source stars extends up to @xmath58 .",
    "for very faint stars , i.e. , @xmath59 , to be detected they should be highly amplified , and thus they are rare .",
    "the slim chance of high amplification becomes even slimmer because of the drop in efficiency .",
    "therefore , the uncertainty in the model lf in the very faint region does not affect the determination of @xmath60 .",
    "amplification bias has a major influence on the einstein time scale distribution @xmath61 because one measures @xmath24 instead of @xmath23 .",
    "how and how much is the time scale distribution affected ? to answer this question i construct time scale distributions for events toward the galactic bulge with and without including the effect of amplification bias using a reasonable mass spectrum model of lenses .",
    "for the construction of @xmath61 , it is required to model the mass and velocity distributions . for the galactic bulge mass distribution ,",
    "i adopt a `` revised cobe '' model that is based on the triaxial cobe model ( dwek et al .",
    "1995 ) except for the central part of the bulge . in the inner @xmath62 of the bulge ,",
    "i adopt the centrally concentrated axisymmetric kent model ( 1992 ) since the cobe model does not match well in this region .",
    "the model is provided in terms of the light density , @xmath63 . for the disk ,",
    "i adopt a gould et al .",
    "( 1996 ) model which has of the form @xmath64 \\exp \\left ( -{r - r_0\\over 3000}\\right ) , \\eqno(4.1)\\ ] ] where @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "both the disk and bulge macho transverse speed is modeled by a gaussian . in the model ,",
    "the velocity distributions of disk machos have means and standard deviations of @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the projected components of the galactic bulge velocity dispersion are computed from the tensor virial theorem and results in @xmath70 and @xmath71 . here",
    "the projected coordinates @xmath72 are set so that the axes are respectively parallel and normal to the galactic plane . for more details of the mass and velocity distributions ,",
    "see han & gould ( 1995 , 1996 )",
    ".    there may be dark lenses as well as lenses from known stellar populations .",
    "the mass spectrum , @xmath73 , of the stellar population is constructed by using the mass - luminosity relation provided by equation ( 5 ) of henry & mccarthy ( 1993 ) . the white dwarf component in the mass range @xmath74",
    "is included by normalizing its mass spectrum so that there are @xmath75 times more white dwarfs than the number of turnoff plus giant stars . finally , brown dwarfs in the mass range @xmath76",
    "are included in the mass spectrum making up the rest of the total bulge mass of @xmath77 , which is adopted from zhao , spergel , & rich ( 1995 ) .",
    "then the total mass of each lens population @xmath78 in the galactic bulge is determined by @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 is the total amount of light in the bulge and the integrated light seen through a unit area ( @xmath82 ) of the baade s window ( bw ) ( kent 1992 ; dwek et al .",
    "the integrated mass of each population is obtained from the mass spectrum model , i.e. , @xmath83 . with the mass spectrum model",
    "i find that @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 , and the resulting total masses in the bulge are @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 for the stellar , white dwarf , and brown dwarf populations , respectively .    with these models , the event rate distribution of bulge - bulge self - lensing and disk - bulge events for a _ single _ source star is computed by equations ( 3.3 ) and ( 3.4 ) of han & gould ( 1996 ) .",
    "the lens masses are drawn from the model mass function . however , the cobe bulge model is given in terms of light density , @xmath63 , and thus the conversion from @xmath63 to @xmath90 is required for proper normalization .",
    "this number - to - light density ratio is determined by @xmath91 here @xmath92 is the total number of objects in the unit area of sky toward bw , in which the number of individual component is obtained by @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 for the stellar , white dwarf , and brown dwarf populations , respectively .",
    "once again the total amount of light in the same area of sky is @xmath96 [ see below eq .  ( 4.2 ) ] .",
    "i find @xmath97 .",
    "note that although brown dwarfs comprise only @xmath98 of the total mass , they account for @xmath99 of the total number density .",
    "once @xmath100 is obtained , the total event rate as a function of time scale not including the amplification bias effect , @xmath101 , by monitoring _",
    "all _ source stars is obtained by multiplying the total number stars , @xmath102 , and the total amount of observation time , @xmath103 , into @xmath100 ; @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the actually detected number of events .",
    "note that @xmath102 is the number of stars in the template , and thus only resolved stars .",
    "the macho group reported @xmath106 events in the first year bulge season , resulting in an optical depth of @xmath107 for all types of stars ( alcock et al .",
    "1996b ) , which implies @xmath108 .",
    "on the other hand , the construction of the total time scale distribution with amplification bias , @xmath109 , requires additional processing which is described below . for a single bright star",
    ", the factor @xmath110 is distributed as @xmath111 \\left [ \\int_{l_{dl}}^{\\infty } dl_b \\phi(l_b ) \\right]^{-1}. \\eqno(4.5)\\ ] ] once @xmath112 is obtained , the effective time scale distribution of faint events @xmath113 is obtained from @xmath114 by @xmath115 then , one finds the total ( both bright and faint ) event time scale distribution by @xmath116 . with the detection efficiency @xmath37 provided by alcock et al .",
    "( 1996b ) , the final time scale distributions with and without amplification bias are computed by @xmath117 and @xmath118 , and they are shown in figure 4 . in the figure ,",
    "the distributions are compared with the observed time scale distribution ( shaded histogram ) obtained by the macho group ( alcock et al .",
    "1996b ) .",
    "there are two major changes in the time scale distribution by taking the amplification bias effect into account .",
    "first , the distribution @xmath119 , in general , has a higher normalization relative to @xmath120 due to the increase in number of stars that are effectively monitored .",
    "the increase factor is @xmath121 , which matches well with the value determined in ",
    "3 using the approximation @xmath122 .",
    "second , @xmath119 is shifted toward shorter time scale compared to @xmath120 due to the additional contribution by faint events which mainly have short time scales .",
    "therefore , a significant fraction of short events ( @xmath123 ) , which could not be explained by known lens populations , might be caused by the amplification bias effect .    however , there are some uncertainties in determining the contribution to the event rate by faint events .",
    "one of the uncertainties comes from the maximum size of separation at which one can isolate the image of the amplified faint star from that of a bright star .",
    "i compute the increase factors in event rate for @xmath124 and @xmath125 and find that @xmath126 , and 2.38 , respectively .",
    "additional uncertainty comes from the blending of bright stars with faint stars . due to the blending",
    ", some fraction of bright events would fail to be detected and the measured time scale would be shorter , resulting lower normalization and additional shift toward shorter time scale in @xmath127 .",
    "however , because of the dominance of the bright star flux , this effect would also be small .",
    "when the amplification bias is not taken into consideration the optical depth might be overestimated by a factor @xmath128 because events are detected by monitoring @xmath129 , while @xmath130 is determined with @xmath102 instead of @xmath131 . on the other hand",
    ", the effects of amplification bias on @xmath23 and @xmath35 do not propagate to the optical depth determination .",
    "this is because by measuring @xmath24 instead of @xmath23 , the time scale decreases by a factor @xmath132 and for the same reason the detection efficiency decreases by a similar factor , i.e. , the same factors cancel each other out and thus there is no net effect .",
    "in addition , most additional events due to amplification bias are expected to have short @xmath24 in which the efficiency is well approximated as linear .",
    "i have shown that amplification bias may have significant effects on the time scale distribution and the optical depth determination , and thus the correction of the bias is very important .",
    "the true distribution @xmath133 can be recovered statistically with the known weight factor @xmath134 in the reverse way that @xmath135 is obtained from @xmath136 .",
    "in addition , for some long @xmath24 events for which very detailed light curves can be constructed , it will be possible to recover the individual true @xmath23 by the fitting the light curves using an additional parameter , the unmagnified flux .",
    "another way to detect biased events is finding the shift of the centroid of source stars caused by the faint star amplification .",
    "this shift was actually detected by alard ( 1996 ) despite the moderate quality of the   for a significant fraction of individual events .",
