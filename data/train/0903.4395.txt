    "the proximity of the site of this gravitational conference to cern and its recently completed large hadron collider ( lhc ) reminds us of the affinity of our ultimate goals in the study of micro- and macro - worlds .",
    "although the lhc will be investigating the minute particles - hadrons , the outreach page of the lhc web - site explains to the wide public that the  aim of the exercise is to smash protons ... into each other and so recreate conditions a fraction of a second after the big bang \" [ @xcite ] .",
    "one can also see clarifications in other sources of information , according to which the  lhc experiments ... will probe matter as it existed at the very beginning of time \" , and that this is a  new era of understanding about the origins and evolution of the universe \" .",
    "these cosmological , rather than particle - physical , explanations can perhaps be justified , at least in part , by the alleged difficulties that our colleagues encountered in communication with general public . according to a circulating rumor ,",
    "at the time when the opening of the lhc was widely covered by tv media , the bbc received numerous messages from angry parents who complained that  you keep talking about all these hardons while children may be watching \" .",
    "surely , the descriptive cosmology is safer and easier to convey to the public than the notions of high - energy physics .",
    "but in the long run , it is indeed true that the fundamental question of the birth of the universe is always in the background of our research intentions .",
    "this problem fascinates both scientific communities , as well as some part of the rest of population .",
    "undoubtedly , new important discoveries will be made at lhc and they will bring us closer to answers to very deep issues in physics .",
    "however , the record - breaking energies of @xmath0 at our accelerators are still very far away from energies we need to understand in order to tackle the problem of the origins of the universe . the ability of lhc to answer the questions on the physics of the very early universe at @xmath1 can be compared with the ability of a telescope hardly resolving a planetary system to answer the questions on the structure of a human hair . in these matters ,",
    "our best hopes are associated with cosmic rather than laboratory studies .",
    "it is now recognized that there is no better way of trying to unveil the origins of the universe than by measuring the relic gravitational waves that were generated by a strong variable gravitational field of the emerging universe .",
    "we may be close to discovering relic gravitational waves , and thus answering some of the most fundamental questions .",
    "these efforts , as well as some principal issues on the nature of gravity , will be discussed below .",
    "the question of origins arises inevitably given the nonstationary character of the world that we observe at large scales .",
    "the broad - brush picture of the expanding homogeneous and isotropic distribution of matter and fields is pretty accurate as a zero - order approximation .",
    "we believe that this approximation was even better in the past , because the existing deviations from homogeneity and isotropy seem to have been growing in the course of time .",
    "it is known from observations that the present size @xmath2 of our patch of approximate large - scale homogeneity and isotropy is at least as big as the present - day hubble radius @xmath3 . combining available observations with plausible statistical assumptions",
    "one can conclude that the size of this patch is significantly bigger than @xmath4 .",
    "it was evaluated to be about @xmath5 [ @xcite ] and maybe larger . in the present discussion",
    ", we will limit ourselves with @xmath6 .",
    "it is also known from observations that the present averaged energy density @xmath7 of all sorts of matter in our patch is close to @xmath8 .",
    "given the observed expansion , one can extrapolate @xmath9 and @xmath10 back in time by the known laws of physics . temporarily leaving aside the possible recent interval of accelerated evolution governed by",
    " dark energy \" ( see sec.[sec:6 ] ) , we will first have @xmath11 at the matter - dominated stage , up to @xmath12 , and then @xmath13 at the radiation - dominated stage .",
    "eventually one encounters a cosmological singularity characterized by the infinitely large energy density .",
    "it is reasonable to think that there must exist a smarter answer to the question of initial state of the observed universe than singularity .",
    "singularity is likely to be only a sign of breakdown of the currently available theories .",
    "it is tempting to begin from the limits of applicability of current theories , that is , from the planck density @xmath14 and the planck size @xmath15 , and imagine that the embryo universe was somehow created by a quantum - gravity ( or by a ` theory - of - everything ' ) process in this state and then started to expand ( see [ @xcite ] and references there ) .",
    "conceptually , it is easier to imagine that the created universe was spatially closed , which means that its total energy , including gravity , was zero and remains zero .",
    "also , the concept of a closed universe helps avoid the question of environment . but",
    "a closed universe is not strictly necessary for our line of argument , so one can think of a small configuration in a possibly larger system .",
    "it is also plausible to think that the classical evolution of our patch of the universe could have started with a natal size somewhat larger than @xmath16 and a natal energy density , of whatever matter that was there , somewhat lower than @xmath17 .",
    "the trouble is , however , that the very natural hypothesis of spontaneous birth of the observed universe will not bring us anywhere near our present state characterized by @xmath18 and @xmath2 , unless we make additional assumptions [ @xcite ] .    in fig.[birth ]",
    ", the present state of the accessible universe is marked by the point p. the hypothesized birth of the universe is marked by the point b. if we go in the past from the point p according to the laws of matter - dominated and radiation - dominated evolutions ( black curve ) , we totally miss the desired point b. indeed , the energy density reaches the planck value @xmath17 when the size of the model universe is @xmath19 instead of the required @xmath20 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we descend from the point b according to the laws of radiation - dominated and then matter - dominated evolutions ( blue curve ) , we totally miss the point p. indeed , the present energy density @xmath18 is reached while the size of the model universe is @xmath21 instead of the required @xmath22 . and the present size @xmath22 is reached when the density drops to @xmath23 instead of the required @xmath18 .",
    "if the size @xmath2 of the homogeneous isotropic patch is larger than the assumed @xmath6 , the point p and the black curve in fig.[birth ] move to the right , and the mis - match of the curves is only exacerbated .",
    "the only way to reach p from b is to assume that the newly born universe has experienced a ` primordial kick ' allowing the point of evolution to jump over from the blue curve to the black curve . during the kick ,",
    "the size of the universe ( or , better to say , the size of the patch of homogeneity and isotropy ) should increase by about 33 orders of magnitude , but the energy density may not change too much or may stay constant . in the zero - order approximation , when the homogeneity and isotropy of the patch are maintained , the level of the energy density and the specific points of the start s and finish f of the kick transition are not very important , as we can reach p from b by many ways . however , the actual route becomes extremely important in the first - order approximation , when we have to take into account the quantum - mechanical generation of primordial cosmological perturbations .",
    "if we are on the right track with this whole picture , the observations indicate ( see below ) that the actual kick trajectory took place at the energy densities around @xmath24 when the hubble parameter @xmath25 was around @xmath26 ( horizontal red line in fig.[birth ] ) , with some possibility of a slight ` over - kick ' to point f@xmath27 or ` under - kick ' to point f@xmath28 , as shown by tilted red lines in fig.[birth ] .",
    "the general relativity allows the required kick trajectories , but only if the properties of the primeval matter were not like those that we deal with in laboratories ( even at lhc ) . the energy density @xmath29 and the effective pressure @xmath30 should satisfy the condition @xmath31 for the kick to proceed with constant energy density , and @xmath32 for over - kick with increasing energy density or @xmath33 for under - kick with decreasing energy density .",
    "the kick hubble parameter @xmath34 remains constant ( @xmath35 ) for the @xmath31 case , and it is slightly increasing ( @xmath36 ) or decreasing ( @xmath37 ) for over - kick and under - kick trajectories , respectively .",
    "if the existing indications ( see below ) that the initial kick did indeed happen are further supported by observations , the detailed inquiry in the properties of the substance that might have driven the kick will be paramount .",
    "solutions with @xmath38 and @xmath39 are allowed by some versions of the scalar field within general relativity .",
    "they are usually associated with the notion of inflation ( see , for example , [ @xcite ] ) . the case with @xmath40 is known as the standard ( de sitter ) inflation .",
    "the scalar field plus gravity model may not be what we are searching for , but at least it was shown [ @xcite ] that the required solutions with @xmath41 are attractors in the space of all solutions of this dynamical system , so these are typical solutions which can bring us from the quantum boundary s [ @xcite ] to the end point f@xmath28 .",
    "( scalar field models do not admit the over - kick trajectories . )",
    "it is often stated that inflation was invented by particle physicists in order to solve outstanding cosmological problems .",
    "the length of the list of solved problems depends on the enthusiasm of the writing inflationary author . to me personally , most of these problems and solutions smack of the soviet - style management , when the goverment creates a problem and then demands the credit for heroically solving it . in any",
    "case , inflation was always assumed to have lasted sufficiently long ; otherwise the point of evolution would have fell short of reaching the point f@xmath28 on the black curve in fig.[birth ] . whatever the problems the inflationary hypothesis solves , they are automatically solved by the hypothesis of primordial kick , whose only rationale is to serve as an ` umbilical cord ' facilitating the joining of the birth event b with the present state of the universe p.    while in the approximation of homogeneity and isotropy the hypothesis of inflation and the hypothesis of initial kick are equal , in the sense that they both solve problems by making plausible assumptions , at the level of cosmological perturbations the inflationary theory got everything wrong , as we shall see below , in sec.[sec:3 ] .",
    "the essentially classical and highly symmetric , i.e. homogeneous and isotropic , solution describing the initial kick should be augmented by quantum fluctuations of the fields that were present there .",
    "it is natural to assume that these quantized fields were initially in their ground ( vacuum ) states .",
    "if the field is properly , superadiabatically , coupled to the strong gravitational field of the kick solution , the quantum - mechanical schrdinger evolution transforms the initial vacuum state of the field into a multiparticle ( strongly squeezed vacuum ) state .",
    "this is called the superadiabatic , or parametric , amplification ; for a recent review of the subject , see [ @xcite ] . not all fields couple properly to the highly symmetric solutions under discussion . for example , electromagnetic fields do not .",
    "but the gravitational field perturbations do couple superadiabatically to the gravitational field of the kick , and therefore they can be amplified .",
    "apparently , this is how the present - time complexity arises from the past - time simplicity .    the chief gravitational field perturbations are two transverse - traceless degrees of freedom describing gravitational waves and two degrees of freedom , scalar and + longitudinal - longitudinal one , which in general relativity exist only if they are accompanied by perturbations of matter .",
    "these latter two degrees of freedom describe density perturbations , and usually only one of them is independent . for models of matter such as scalar fields , the equations for density perturbations are almost identical to the equations for gravitational waves .",
    "the arising multiparticle states at each frequency are conveniently combined in the power spectra of these quantum - mechanically generated perturbations .",
    "the crucial quantity , both for gravitational waves and density perturbations , is the primordial power spectrum of the gravitational field ( metric ) perturbations .",
    "this is because the gravitational field perturbations survive numerous transformations of the matter content of the universe at the end of the kick and later , and therefore they provide the unambiguous input values for physics and calculations at the radiation - dominated and matter - dominated stages .",
    "the values of the hubble parameter along the kick trajectory and the shape of the kick trajectory itself are very important , because they define the numerical levels and spectral slopes of the primordial metric spectra .",
    "the hubble parameter @xmath42 determines the amplitude of metric perturbations , whereas the tilt of the red lines in fig.[birth ] determines the tilt of the spectrum .",
    "the primordial metric power spectrum @xmath43 is a function of the time - independent wavenumber @xmath44 , where the wavenumber @xmath45 corresponds to the wavelength which will be equal to @xmath4 today .     of relic gravitational waves .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the primordial spectral index @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) , while the dashed line is for @xmath48 ( @xmath49).,width=377,height=302 ]    very similar forms of equations for gravitational waves ( gw ) and density perturbations ( dp ) , and identically the same physics of their superadiabatic amplification , translate into very similar power spectra @xmath43 . in a good approximation , sufficient for our purposes , the generated gw and dp power spectra can be written in the power - law forms @xmath50 where the spectral indices @xmath51 are constants , and @xmath52 . for flat kick evolutions ,",
    "i.e. for horizontal lines like the red line in fig.[birth ] , the generated spectra have flat ( harrison - zeldovich - peebles ) shape , i.e. @xmath53 . the over - kick or under - kick evolutions tilt the spectrum toward the ` blue ' or ` red ' shapes , respectively . of course , it is simplistic to expect that the red transitions in fig.[birth ] should be strictly straight lines and the spectral indices @xmath51 strict numbers independent of the wavenumber @xmath44 . in simple models driven by scalar fields ,",
    "the spectral indices are actually slowly decreasing functions of @xmath44 .",
    "the derivation of primordial spectra is based only on general relativity and quantum mechanics .",
    "the comparison of spectra and their consequences with observations is our best chance to learn whether the kick did indeed take place and how it looked like . in particular , assuming that the observed anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) are indeed caused by cosmological perturbations of quantum - mechanical origin , we conclude that the kick hubble parameter @xmath42 was close to @xmath54 , because this kick has generated the amplitudes of metric perturbations at the level of @xmath55 , which in their turn produced the observed large - scale cmb anisotropy at the level of @xmath55 .",
    "the perturbations with wavelengths much shorter than the radius @xmath2 of our patch were processed in the course of evolution , and therefore the form of the spectrum in the recombination era ( and today ) differs from primordial .",
    "the spectrum is no longer a smooth function of the wavenumber ( or frequency ) but contains maxima and minima .",
    "this is a consequence of the standing - wave pattern of the primordial metric perturbations - the inevitable feature of the underlying quantum - mechanical squeezing .",
    "the power - law slope of the envelope of the oscillations also changes .    as an example , in fig.[gwspectrum ] , taken from [ @xcite ] , we show today s power spectra as functions of frequency @xmath56 for relic gravitational waves normalized to the observed cmb anisotropies .",
    "only a few first cycles of oscillations at lowest frequencies are shown .",
    "two possibilities are depicted in this figure : the dashed line is the resulting spectrum which originated in the superadiabatic amplification during the horizontal red line transition of fig.[birth ] , whereas the solid line is for the resulting spectrum originated in a slightly over - kick transition . at the highest relevant frequencies , before the spectrum sharply goes down , one can see a noticable increase of power in @xmath57 .",
    "this is the result of the after - kick piece of evolution governed by matter with a stiff ( zeldovich ) equation of state @xmath58 .",
    "this piece of evolution was assumed in this calculation , but it is not guaranteed .",
    "we may be not so lucky to have to deal in the future high - frequency experiments with this increased gravitational - wave power .",
    "now we turn to what is broadly addressed as inflation , and specifically to predictions of inflationary theory on cosmological perturbations .",
    "predictions of inflationary theory are dramatically different from what was described above , in sec.[sec:2 ] . in attempt of deriving density perturbations ,",
    "inflationary authors invariably begin with vacuum fluctuations of the scalar field ( inflaton ) in de sitter space - time .",
    "then , after some jumping between variables and gauges , they conclude that the amplitudes of scalar metric perturbations ( often denoted by letters @xmath59 or @xmath60 ) should be infinitely large , in the same physical system and right from the very beginning . instead of eq.([psa ] ) , the inflation - predicted primordial metric power spectrum for density perturbations reads : @xmath61 where the parameter @xmath62 is @xmath63 .",
    "this parameter is almost a constant in cases under discussion .",
    "the standard ( de sitter ) inflation is characterized by @xmath64 ( @xmath40 ) , and therefore the inflation - predicted standard spectrum blows up to infinity at every wavelength and for any non - zero value of @xmath42 .    formula ( [ psain ] ) is the main contribution of inflationary theory to the subject of cosmological perturbations .",
    "having arrived at the incorrect formula with the arbitrarily small factor @xmath62 in the denominator of this formula , inflationary theory elevates the question of the  energy scale of inflation \" to the status of a major scientific problem , which inflationists will be happily solving for decades to come .",
    "indeed , one is now free to start with energy densities @xmath65 , say , 80 orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath17 and the hubble parameter @xmath42 40 orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath66 ( grey line in fig.[birth ] ) .",
    "one can still claim that ( s)he has built a successful inflationary model , because the required level @xmath55 of primordial metric amplitudes for density perturbations can now be achieved by simply making the grey line sufficiently horizontal ( but not exactly horizontal ) and thus making the denominator @xmath62 in eq.([psain ] ) sufficiently small ( but not exactly zero ) .",
    "astrophysics does not permit one to take @xmath42 smaller than the value of @xmath25 in the era of nucleosynthesis , i.e. below the grey line in fig.[birth ] .",
    "otherwise , one could have started with the  energy scale of inflation \" equal to the energy density of water and still build a successful inflationary cosmology .",
    "inflationary theory substitutes the predicted divergency of density perturbations at @xmath64 , eq.([psain ] ) , by the claim that it is the amount of relic gravitational waves that should be small .",
    "this is meant to be represented by the ",
    "tensor - to - scalar \" ratio @xmath67 , which is the ratio of the gw power spectrum from eq.([psa ] ) to the dp power spectrum from eq.([psain ] ) . in inflationary theory",
    ", it is written as @xmath68    the wmap ( wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ) team reports the limits on the parameter @xmath67 that were found from the observations [ @xcite ] .",
    "one can see these limits in the form of the likelihood function for @xmath67 in the left panel of fig . 3 in ref.@xcite .",
    "the maximum of the likelihood function is at @xmath69 , which means that the most likely value of the parameter @xmath67 is @xmath69 .",
    "then , according to eq.([tsr ] ) , the most likely value of @xmath62 is @xmath64 .",
    "since @xmath62 is in the denominator of the inflation - predicted power spectrum ( [ psain ] ) , one concludes that if the inflationary predictions are correct , then the most likely values of density perturbations responsible for the data observed and analyzed by the wmap team are infinitely large .",
    "nevertheless , this situation is often qualified as the  striking success of inflation \" [ @xcite ] demonstrated by the wmap findings .    for the parameter @xmath67 , the inflationary theory predicts practically everything what one can possibly imagine , including something like @xmath70 as the inflationary outcome , based on eq.([psain ] ) , of the most sophisticated string - inspired models ( for a review , see [ @xcite ] and references there ) .",
    "the big problem is not that the seemingly most advanced theories predict @xmath70 , thus making the search for relic gravitational waves look ridiculous .",
    "the big problem is that when the relic gravitational waves are discovered , the proposers , being misguided by their own derivations , will reject microphysical theories which in fact may be perfectly viable , and will accept theories which in fact may be totally wrong .",
    "there are several reasons to believe that the observed cmb anisotropies are caused by cosmological perturbations of quantum - mechanical origin .",
    "probably the major one is the observed oscillations in the cmb power spectra , which are likely to be a reflection of the quantum - mechanical squeezing and the associated standing - wave pattern of the primordial metric perturbations .",
    "if cosmological perturbations do indeed have quantum - mechanical origin , eq.([psa ] ) implies that the gw and dp contributions to the lower - order cmb multipoles @xmath71 should be of the same order of magnitude .",
    "relic gravitational waves have not been scattered or absorbed in any significant amount since the time of their quantum - mechanical generation .",
    "the explicit identification of relic gravitational waves in the data would be a monumental step in the study of the primordial kick and the origins of the universe .",
    "density perturbations and gravitational waves affect temperature and polarization of the cmb .",
    "the polarization is usually characterized by the two components - e and b. the b component is not generated by density perturbations , and therefore it is often stated that the aim of the exercise is to detect b - modes .",
    "this is not so .",
    "the aim of the exercise is to detect relic gravitational waves , not to detect b - modes .",
    "gravitational waves are present in all correlation functions of the cmb , and one should be smart enough to distinguish their contribution from competing contributions .",
    "the b - mode channel of information has some advantages , but many disadvantages too .",
    "for example , the 5-year wmap data on the bb correlation function are not informative because they are mostly noise . at the same time , the much stronger te signal is recorded at a large number of data points , which allows one to derive meaningful conclusions about the gw contribution .     as a function of @xmath72 for the @xmath73 ( black ) and @xmath74 ( red ) observational channels .",
    "the points show numerical results , whereas the curves are analytical approximations.,width=491,height=415 ]    the 5-year wmap te data were thorougly analyzed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the conclusion of this investigation is such that the lower-@xmath71 te and tt data do contain a hint of presence of the gravitational wave contribution . in terms of the parameter @xmath72 , which gives the ratio of contributions of gw and dp to the temperature quadrupole , the best - fit model produced @xmath75",
    "this means that 20% of the temperature quadrupole is accounted for by gravitational waves and 80% by density perturbations .",
    "the residual wmap noise is high , so the uncertainty of this determination is large , and it easily includes the hypothesis that there is no gw contribution at all .",
    "however , the uncertainty will be much smaller in the forthcoming more sensitive observations , most notably with the @xmath76 satellite .",
    "it is likely that the @xmath76 mission will be capable of strengthening our belief that the primordial kick did take place , and at the near - planckian values of the hubble parameter , @xmath77 .",
    "the future te and bb data from @xmath76 satellite were simulated and analyzed in [ @xcite ] .",
    "the quality of the future performance of the bb channel is not clear , so the authors discuss the ` optimistic ' and ` realistic ' options .",
    "the result of the analysis is shown in fig.[section6_fig3 ] , where the signal to noise parameter @xmath78 is plotted as a function of @xmath72 .",
    "it is seen from the graph that if the maximum likelihood value @xmath75 derived from the wmap5 te and tt data is taken as a real signal , it will be present at a better than 3@xmath79 level in the @xmath80 te observational channel , and at a better than 2@xmath79 level in the ` realistic ' bb channel .",
    "the time of discovery of relic gravitational waves may be nearer than is usually believed .",
    "one of important premises in the above conclusions is the assumption that the general relativity remains valid up to energy densities approaching planckian limit .",
    "although there is no obvious reason to doubt this , any piece of new information on the domain of applicability of a fundamental theory is useful .",
    "the tests of gravitational theories in various circumstances and conditions is an important part of current research , including the results and plans discussed at this conference . as usual ,",
    "the set - up of an experiment and interpretaion of its results partially depend on the accepted theoretical framework , which in the case of general relativity seems to be obvious and well established : ",
    "gravity is geometry \" .",
    "i personally feel that the emphasis on the geometrical aspect of gravity has exhausted its usefulness and has become an impeding rather than a driving factor in gravitational physics .",
    "there seems to be something odd in the conviction of a large part of our community that the gravitational waves are  oscillations in the fabric of space - time \" , and that the ongoing and planned gravitational - wave experiments are attempting to measure the  strain in the fabric of space - time \" .",
    "this understanding is usually presented as a consequence of the equivalence principle which forbids , so is believed , such things as rigorously defined local gravitational energy density and flux of energy . at best",
    ", this understanding allows surrogates , such as the averaged pseudotensors .",
    "the argument seems to be especially appropriate for the current research , wherein the gravitational - wave detectors are usually small and , in a sense , local .",
    "the size of the detector is much smaller than the wavelength which the detector is most sensitive to , so the gravitational - wave flux through the detector is supposed to be completely or partially removable by a coordinate transformation .",
    "( in fact , the four pseudotensor components describing energy density and flux are removable by four coordinate transformation functions everywhere , not only locally . ) therefore , the argument goes , it is the  squeezing and stretching of space - time itself \" that is a proper description of the phenomenon , and not the absorption of the part of the gravitational wave flux by the detector , which makes the detector ` klick ' and register the event .",
    "the problem appears to be more than simply linguistic .",
    "the concept  gravity is geometry \" can be misleading in the analysis of the detector s response and in the interpretation of results . more importantly , it obscures the deeper understanding of gravity .",
    "namely , the fact that the einstein s general relativity is a perfectly consistent non - linear gravitational field theory in flat ( minkowski ) space - time , with rigorously defined gravitational energy - momentum tensor , and with no need for geometrical notions of curved space - time .",
    "the field - theoretical approach to general relativity is based on the concept of gravitational field @xmath81 defined in flat space - time with the metric tensor @xmath82 .",
    "the curvature tensor constructed from @xmath82 is identically zero : @xmath83 the choice of coordinates @xmath84 is in one s hands , so the @xmath82 can always be transformed , if necessary , to the minkowski matrix @xmath85 ( class of lorentzian coordinates ) . in arbitrary curvilinear coordinates ,",
    "the covariant derivatives are denoted by a semicolon  @xmath86 .",
    "the gravitational lagrangian @xmath87 is a quadratic function of first derivatives of the field @xmath88 ( see [ @xcite ] and references there ) .",
    "the variation of @xmath87 with respect to the field variables @xmath88 leads to the gravitational equations of motion : @xmath89 _ { ; \\alpha ; \\beta } = \\kappa t^{\\mu\\nu}.\\ ] ] in the right hand side ( r.h.s ) of these equations stands the gravitational energy - momentum tensor @xmath90 ( and @xmath91 ) .",
    "the @xmath90 is rigorously defined as variational derivative of @xmath87 with respect to variations of the metric tensor @xmath92 , with the constraint ( [ r ] ) properly taken into account .",

    "the divergence ( contracted covariant derivative ) of the left hand side of equations ( [ evac ] ) , ( [ emat ] ) vanishes identically .",
    "this means that the equations of motion contain the differential conservation laws @xmath97 the differential conservation laws can be converted into conserved integrals for isolated non - radiating systems .",
    "the geometrical description of gravity can be introduced as follows .",
    "the special form of @xmath87 , which is the field - theoretical analog of the hilbert - einstein lagrangian , and the universal coupling of gravity to matter assumed in @xmath93 , which is a realization of the equivalence principle , allow one to ` glue together ' the metric tensor @xmath98 and the field variables @xmath88 into one tensorial object @xmath99 .",
    "the lagrangians @xmath87 and @xmath93 , as well as the gravitational and matter field equations , can now be rewritten in terms of this object and its derivatives alone , plus matter variables .",

    "note that the field equations as a whole can be rewritten in terms of @xmath105 , but not individual parts of these equations .",
    "the gravitational energy - momentum tensor @xmath90 can not be rewritten as a function of the tensor @xmath105 and its first derivatives alone .",
    "this is something to be expected , as there is no tensor that one could build from @xmath105 and first derivatives of @xmath105 , apart of @xmath105 itself .",
    "therefore , there does not exist any meaningful gravitational energy - momentum tensor in the geometrical version of general relativity .",
    "the universal character of the gravitational field , which allows one to ` glue together ' @xmath98 and @xmath88 into a single object @xmath107 in the total lagrangian and in the equations of motion , makes the flat space - time ` non - observable ' in the presence of gravitational fields .",
    "this is not surprising .",
    "we would have encountered the same ` non - observability ' of flat space - time in classical electrodynamics had we had access only to test particles with one and the same charge to mass ratio @xmath108 . in the absence of neutral particles , which are capable of drawing the lines and angles of the minkowski world in the region occupied by electromagnetic field , one would be given the option to interpret the motion of charged particles as arising due to the ` curvature of space - time itself ' rather than due to the external electromagnetic field .",
    "this is a possible interpretation , but not particularly illuminating , at least in this case .",
    "the generally covariant theories , including general relativity , admit arbitrary coordinate transformations .",
    "a coordinate transformation acting on an object , such for example as the metric tensor or the energy - momentum tensor of the electromagnetic field , can always be rearranged to state that the coordinates are not touched , but the object itself receives an increment in the same point .",
    "the rule of changing the numerical values of the object to the new ones involves the technique of lie derivatives and depends on the transformation properties of the object and a given coordinate transformation . if a dynamical equation is formulated as equality to zero of some tensor composed of the underlying objects , the increments of this tensor vanish when the dynamical equation is satisfied .",
    "so , a solution of this dynamical equation translates into a new solution .",
    "this procedure of changing the values of objects in the same coordinate frame and generating new solutions can be called a gauge transformation .    the ability to make arbitrary coordinate transformations in the field - theoretical general relativity",
    "can be rearranged to state even more .",
    "namely , that the coordinate system @xmath84 and the metric tensor @xmath109 remain untouched , but the set of gravitational field variables @xmath81 , as well as matter variables , change to another set of variables in the same coordinate system @xmath84 . under this operation , the gravitational field equations ( [ evac ] ) , ( [ emat ] ) , as well as the matter field equations and the conservation laws ( [ cons ] ) , transform into a combination of themselves , so that a solution of field equations translates into another solution . a coordinate transformation interpreted this way can be called a ` true ' gauge transformation , because it looks very much similar to the gauge ( gradient ) transformation of classical electrodynamics , which changes electromagnetic potentials , but not coordinates and metric .",
    "however , the origin of gauge transformations in gravity is different - it is all the same arbitrary coordinate transformations . in general",
    ", there is no any other symmetries .    while the equations as a whole are gauge - invariant ( transform into a combination of themselves ) under the action of ` true ' gauge transformations , individual parts of the equations are not . for example , in eq.([evac ] ) the l.h.s . and r.h.s",
    "receive individual non - zero increments , but such that they precisely cancel each other , leaving eq.([evac ] ) gauge - invariant . to demand the gauge - invariance of @xmath90 on its own , thus attempting to make @xmath90  physically significant \" and not ",
    "devoid of physical meaning \" [ @xcite ] , would be equivalent to demanding that the field equations should be violated after a gauge transformation .",
    "the same holds true for conservation laws ( [ cons ] ) . even if the energy - momentum tensor @xmath95 represents only a couple of free particles , @xmath95 changes under the action of ` true ' gauge transformations",
    "so , the associated change of @xmath96 must take care of new positions and new dynamics of the particles .",
    "the @xmath96 can not be gauge - invariant on its own , but the gauge - related solutions are observationally equivalent , at least in the classical domain of the theory , and as long as one ignores initial and boundary conditions .",
    "as far as one can see at present , the geometrical and field - theoretical pictures of gravity are representations of one and the same theory of general relativity , not different theories .",
    "each of the viewpoints has its advantages and disadvantages , and we have to become eloquent in both of them .",
    "feynman once remarked [ @xcite ] :  if the peculiar viewpoint taken is truly experimentally equivalent to the usual in the realm of the known there is always a range of applications and problems in this realm for which the special viewpoint gives one a special power and clarity of thought , which is valuable in itself \" .    in fig.[einst ]",
    "one can see two famous photographs of einstein .",
    "he is shown at times of the beginning and the end of his scientific career . in the left photo ,",
    "the physicist einstein is here , in bern , in 1905 .",
    "he was denouncing the notions of absolute space and time , but was not yet under the influence of geometrical techniques .",
    "in the right photo , einstein is in princeton , in 1951 , when the idea that the space - time is something like a  fabric \" , which can curve , wrap , expand , oscillate , etc . was accepted . by that time",
    ", einstein has twice changed his opinion about the reality of gravitational waves .",
    "this second picture , is it not addressed to those of us who believe too much literally that  gravity is geometry \" ?",
    "the special power and clarity of thought mentioned by feynman may be especially valuable now , when we are facing the situation that some modifications of general relativity may be required .",
    "hopefully , the recent indications on the accelerated expansion of our approximated homogeneous isotropic universe can be resolved by more accurate understanding of the limits of applicability of this approximation , and this will be so much for the  dark energy \" .",
    "but if not , the prospect of modifications of einstein s gravity will be looming large . the internal consistency of the candidate modified theory will be a larger hurdle to overcome than agreement with observations .    without a physical guidance ,",
    "we are in front of an ocean of possibilities . the geometrical route ",
    "gravity is geometry \" will definitely lead to undesirable higher - order differential equations in terms of @xmath105 , as there is no way of modifying the second - order dynamical equations ( [ 1gmn ] ) except adding a new fundamental constant - the cosmological @xmath110-term .",
    "in contrast , the very logic of the field - theoretical approach allows natural and consistent generalisations of general relativity without raising the order of differential field equations [ @xcite ] .",
    "these generalisations are based on the possibility ( and maybe necessity ) of adding the ` mass'-term @xmath111\\ ] ] to the gravitational lagrangian @xmath87 . in this expression ,",
    "the constants @xmath112 and @xmath113 have dimensionality of @xmath114^{-2}$ ] , and @xmath115 .",
    ", while the lower solid line is a solution for @xmath116.,width=340,height=264 ]    the linearised approximation of this generalised gravity allows one to interpret the introduced constants as masses @xmath117 and @xmath118 of @xmath119 and @xmath120 gravitons , @xmath121 the interpretation in terms of masses implies @xmath122 and @xmath123 , but the theory allows also @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "when both constants @xmath126 and @xmath127 are sent to zero , this finite - range gravitational theory smoothly approaches the equations and observational predictions of the massless general relativity - the property not shared by many other proposed modifications .",
    "it is amazing to see how much the class of allowed solutions broadens and changes under the impact of the seemingly innocent modification ( [ two ] ) of general relativity .",
    "the modifications affect the polarization states and propagation of gravitational waves , the event horizons of black holes , the early - time and late - time cosmological evolution . in cosmological applications , the signs and values of @xmath126 and @xmath127",
    "are crucial for the character of changes in the early - time and late - time evolution .",
    "in particular , if one allows @xmath126 to be negative , the late - time evolution of a homogeneous isotropic universe experiences an accelerated expansion , which we may be required to explain if the observations keep demanding this phenomenon .",
    "the graph of the modified scale factor @xmath128 as a function of time is shown in fig.[cosmol ] , taken from the second paper in ref.@xcite .",
    "the quest for better understanding of gravity is far from over .",
    "this conference is certainly not the last one on the topic of nature of gravity .",
    "hopefully , important progress will be reached in the near future , particularly as a result of new experiments , such as @xmath76 and others .",
    "having discovered relic gravitational waves , we will be more confident about the limits of applicability of general relativity and will better understand how cosmic gravity works in concert with quantum mechanics . more excitment is anticipated ."
