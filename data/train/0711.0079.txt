    "recent observations of type ia supernovae indicate that the expansion of the universe is accelerating [ 1 - 5 ] and lead to the search for a new type of matter which violates the strong energy condition , i.e. , @xmath0 .",
    "the matter responsible for this condition to be satisfied at some stage of evolution of the universe is referred to as _ dark energy _ [ 6 - 8 ] .",
    "several candidates to present dark energy have been suggested with observations : the cosmological constant [ 7 , 9 ] , quintessence [ 10 , 11 ] , phantom [ 12 , 13 ] , braneworld models [ 14 ] , pure chaplygin gas model [ 15 ] , generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) model [ 16 , 17 ] , modified chaplygin gas ( mcg ) model [ 19 , 20 ] . in the gcg and mcg",
    "approach dark energy and dark matter can be unified by using an exotic equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "interesting feature of mcg ( or gcg ) eos is that it shows radiation era ( or dust era ) in the past while a @xmath1cdm model in the future . + in 2003 ,",
    "p. f. gonz@xmath2lez - diaz [ 21 ] have introduced the generalized cosmic chaplygin gas ( gccg ) model in such a way that the resulting models can be made stable and free from unphysical behaviours even when the vacuum fluid satisfies the phantom energy condition .",
    "the eos of this model is @xmath3\\ ] ] where @xmath4 with @xmath5 a constant which can take on both positive and negative values and @xmath6 , @xmath7 being a positive definite constant which can take on values larger than unity .",
    "the eos reduces to that of current chaplygin unified models for dark matter and dark energy in the limit @xmath8 and satisfies the conditions : ( i ) it becomes a de sitter fluid at late time and when @xmath9 , ( ii ) it reduces to @xmath10 in the limit that the chaplygin parameter @xmath11 , ( iii ) it also reduces to the eos of current chaplygin unified dark matter models at high energy density and ( iv ) the evolution of density perturbations derived from the chosen eos becomes free from the pathological behaviour of the matter power spectrum for physically reasonable values of the involved parameters at late time .",
    "this eos shows dust era in the past and @xmath1cdm in the future .",
    "+ since models trying to provide a description of the cosmic acceleration are proliferating , there exists the problem of discriminating between the various contenders . to this aim sahni",
    "et al [ 22 ] proposed a pair of parameters @xmath12 , called _ statefinder _ parameters . in fact trajectories in the @xmath12 plane corresponding to different cosmological models demonstrate qualitatively different behaviour .",
    "the above statefinder diagnostic pair has the following form :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the hubble parameter and the deceleration parameter respectively .",
    "the new feature of the statefinder is that it involves the third derivative of the cosmological radius .",
    "these parameters are dimensionless and allow us to characterize the properties of dark energy .",
    "trajectories in the @xmath12 plane corresponding to different cosmological models , for example @xmath1cdm model diagrams correspond to the fixed point @xmath16 .",
    "+ in this paper , we consider the universe is filled with the mixture of radiation and gccg in section ii .",
    "we perform a statefinder diagnostic to this model without and with interaction in different cases in sections iii and iv respectively . from statefinder parameters we have shown graphically that the universe starts from radiation era instead of dust era .",
    "different phases of the evolution of the universe have been shown graphically . with interaction case",
    ", the model goes from radiation to @xmath1cdm era only and without interaction case the model goes from radiation to @xmath1cdm and further from @xmath1cdm to phantom era and then back to @xmath1cdm .",
    "the paper ends with a short discussion in section v. +",
    "the metric of a spatially flat isotropic and homogeneous universe in frw model is ,    @xmath17\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 is the scale factor . + the einstein field equations are ( choosing @xmath19 )    @xmath20    and @xmath21    the energy conservation equation ( @xmath22 ) is @xmath23    where , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the total energy density and the pressure of the universe , given by , @xmath26 and @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 are respectively the energy density and pressure due to the gccg satisfying the eos ( 1 ) and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the energy density and the pressure corresponding to the radiation fluid with eos , @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "+ since gccg can explain the evolution of the universe starting from dust era to @xmath1cdm , considering the mixture of gccg with radiation would make it possible to explain the evolution of the universe from radiation to @xmath1cdm .",

    "as expected this model represents the evolution of the universe from radiation era to @xmath1cdm with a discontinuity at dust . in the second case the interaction term is chosen in a very typical form to solve the corresponding conservation equations analytically . also the statefinder parameters are evaluated for various choices of parameters and the trajectories in the @xmath12 plane",

    "the model goes further from @xmath1cdm to phantom era and then back to @xmath1cdm .",
    "moreover , in figure 4 , there is further transition from @xmath1cdm to decelerating phase and then then again back to @xmath1cdm .",
    "thus we can conclude that the present model describes a number of transitions from decelerating to accelerating phase and vice - versa .",
