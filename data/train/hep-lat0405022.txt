    "the masses of the strange and light quarks are fundamental parameters of the standard model that are _ a priori _ unknown and must be determined from experiment .",
    "this is complicated , however , by confinement in qcd , so that quarks can not be observed as isolated particles .",
    "we can only determine their masses by solving qcd for observable quantities , such as hadron masses , as a function of the quark mass .",
    "this can be accomplished with the numerical techniques of lattice qcd .",
    "precise knowledge of quark masses constrains beyond the standard model scenarios as well as providing input for phenomenological calculations of standard model physics . the strange quark mass , in particular ,",
    "is needed for various phenomenological studies , including the important cp - violating quantity @xmath14  @xcite , where its uncertainty severely limits the theoretical precision .",
    "previously , shortcomings in the formulation of qcd on the lattice and limitations in computing power have meant that lattice calculations were forced to work with an unrealistic qcd vacuum that either ignored dynamical ( sea ) quarks or included only @xmath1 and @xmath2 quarks with masses much heavier than in nature .",
    "this condemned determinations of the quark masses to rather large systematic errors ( 1020% ) arising from the inconsistency of comparing such a theory with experiment .",
    "the determination presented here uses simulations with the improved staggered quark formalism that have a much more realistic qcd vacuum with two light dynamical quarks and one strange dynamical quark .",
    "we describe how the bare quark masses in the lattice qcd lagrangian can be fixed using chiral perturbation theory to extrapolate lattice results to the physical point , and how the lattice quark masses obtained can be transformed to a continuum scheme ( ) using lattice perturbation theory . working in the region of dynamical @xmath15 quark masses below @xmath16 and down to @xmath7",
    "gives us control of chiral extrapolations and avoids the large systematic errors from dynamical quark mass and unquenching effects that previous calculations have had .",
    "staggered quarks are fast to simulate .",
    "they keep a remnant of chiral symmetry on the lattice , and therefore give a goldstone pion mass which vanishes with the bare quark mass .",
    "this allows the relatively simple determination of the quark mass described here , which is not available , for example , in the wilson quark formalism .",
    "the staggered quark formalism does have several unwanted features , however . with the  staggered action ,",
    "large discretization errors appear , although they are formally only @xmath17 or higher ( @xmath18 is the lattice spacing ) .",
    "the renormalization of operators to match a continuum scheme can also be large and badly behaved in perturbation theory .",
    "this is true , for example , for the mass renormalization that is needed here .",
    "it turns out that both problems have the same source , a particular form of discretization error in the action , called `` taste violation , '' and both are ameliorated by use of the improved staggered formalism  @xcite .",
    "the perturbation theory then shows small renormalizations  @xcite and discretization errors are much reduced  @xcite .",
    "empirically , taste violation remains the most important discretization error in the improved theory , despite being subleading to `` generic '' discretization errors .",
    "the goldstone meson masses we will discuss here are affected by this at one - loop in the chiral expansion .",
    "staggered chiral perturbation theory ( )  @xcite allows us to control these effects and reduce discretization errors significantly .",
    "a more fundamental concern about staggered fermions is based on the need to take the fourth root of the quark determinant to convert the four - fold duplication of `` tastes '' into one quark flavor .",
    "it is possible that there are nonlocalities in the continuum limit that would spoil the description of qcd at some level .",
    "checks of the formalism against experimental results @xcite , make this unlikely , we believe , but further work along these lines is crucial and continuing .",
    "the simulation data of the milc collaboration  @xcite are analyzed ; staggered quarks with leading errors at @xmath19  @xcite and one - loop symanzik improved gluons with tadpole - improvement  @xcite .",
    "two sets of configurations are used : a `` coarse '' set at lattice spacing @xmath20  fm and sea quark masses of @xmath21 , 0.007 , 0.01 , 0.02 , 0.03 with @xmath22 , and a `` fine '' set at @xmath23  fm with sea quark masses of @xmath24 0.0124 and @xmath25 .",
    "here we use primes on the sea quark masses to emphasize that these are the nominal quark masses used in the simulation , not the physical masses @xmath0 or @xmath26 .",
    "the simulations are `` partially quenched , '' with a range of valence masses from @xmath27 down to @xmath28 ( coarse ) and @xmath29 ( fine ) , not necessarily equal to the sea quark masses , simulated on each lattice .",
    "it should be noted that the quark masses in lattice units quoted here contain a factor of @xmath30 , the tadpole - improvement factor determined from the fourth root of the average plaquette , compared with a more conventional definition of quark mass  @xcite .",
    "this is taken care of nonperturbatively before our renormalization below .",
    "the lattice spacing @xmath18 is determined ultimately from the @xmath31@xmath32 mass difference  @xcite , a useful quantity because it is approximately independent of quark masses , including the @xmath33-mass .",
    "an analysis of a wide range of other `` gold - plated '' hadron masses and decay constants on these configurations shows agreement with experiment at the 23% level  @xcite .",
    "gold - plated hadrons are stable ( in qcd ) , with masses at least @xmath34 below decay thresholds , so their masses are well - defined both experimentally and theoretically , important for fixing the parameters of qcd .",
    "the only gold - plated light mesons available to fix @xmath3 and @xmath0 are the @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "there is none with only @xmath35 valence quarks because the @xmath36 is unstable and the pseudoscalar is strongly mixed .",
    "baryons can provide an alternative , the nucleon for @xmath3 and the @xmath37 for @xmath0 , but their statistical errors are large , and they are not very sensitive to the quark masses .",
    "our analysis uses   @xcite to fit the dependence of the results on the quark masses .",
    "this dependence can then be extrapolated / interpolated to the point where the ( goldstone ) @xmath4 and @xmath5 have their physical masses , thereby determining the bare lattice @xmath3 and @xmath0 . at the level of precision at which we are working , and because we take @xmath38 , we must be careful about electromagnetic ( em ) and isospin - violating effects . at lowest nontrivial order in @xmath39 and the quark masses , dashen s theorem @xcite states that @xmath40 and @xmath41 receive equal em contributions ; while the @xmath42 and @xmath43 masses are unaffected . however , at next order , there can be large and different contributions to @xmath40 and @xmath41 of order @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "let @xmath45 @xcite parameterize violations of dashen s theorem : @xmath46 .",
    "then refs .",
    "@xcite suggest @xmath47 .",
    "including em and isospin effects , the physical values of @xmath3 and @xmath0 can then be determined by extrapolating the lattice squared meson masses to @xmath48 and @xmath49 , using experimental values on the right hand side of these expressions .",
    "we are neglecting @xmath50 corrections , which should be tiny @xcite .",
    "em contributions to the neutral particle masses are also neglected , and we take account of this in our error . for the @xmath42",
    "the violation of dashen s theorem is @xmath51 and negligible . for @xmath52",
    "the violation is in principle the same order as for @xmath53 @xcite , but in model calculations @xcite it appears to be very small . to be conservative , we consider em contributions to @xmath52 of order of half the violations of dashen s theorem , with unknown sign .",
    "effectively , this replaces @xmath47 in the formula for @xmath54 above with the range 02 , which we take as the em systematic error .",
    "here we briefly describe the fits to   theory forms and the estimate of the associated errors  @xcite . because the squared meson masses ( @xmath55 ) are nearly linear in the valence quark masses , the final values of the quark masses are quite insensitive to details of the chiral fits .",
    "chiral logs and nlo ( and higher ) analytic terms only affect the results at the @xmath56 level .    is a joint expansion in @xmath57 and @xmath58 , which are dimensionless measures of the size of quark mass and lattice spacing effects , respectively : @xmath59 @xmath60 is the quark mass , @xmath61 is the tree - level mass of a @xmath62 meson , and @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath64 is an average meson splitting between different tastes . on the coarse lattices @xmath65 ; on the fine , @xmath66 .    for physical kaons ,",
    "the relevant expansion parameter is @xmath67 . since our lattice data is very precise ( 0.1 to 0.7% on @xmath55 ) , it is clear that we can not expect nlo or even nnlo  to work well up to the kaon mass .",
    "if however the valence quark masses are limited by @xmath68 , we obtain good fits including nnlo analytic terms .",
    "such fits are consistent with  expectations : the coefficients of nlo and nnlo terms are @xmath69 when these terms are expressed as functions of @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "when fitting up to the strange mass we include nnnlo as well as nnlo terms , but satisfy the chiral constraints by fixing the nlo terms from lower mass fits . since the @xmath35 quark mass can be reached in simulations , the form of the nnlo and nnnlo terms is not important ; such terms simply allow for a reasonable interpolation to the physical @xmath0 .",
    "both decay constant and @xmath55 data and both coarse and fine ensembles are fit simultaneously .",
    "although nlo taste - violations are explicitly included , we allow for `` generic '' discretization errors by using a bayesian fit  @xcite that permits physical parameters to change by order @xmath70 in going from the coarse to the fine configurations .",
    "the @xmath32 system provides an absolute lattice scale , but it is convenient to use the relative scale determined from @xmath71 , a parameter derived from the heavy quark potential  @xcite , to compare accurately the scale for different sea quark masses within the coarse or fine set . @xmath32 splittings give @xmath72fm @xcite . using the volume dependence calculated in nlo  @xcite , ( and tested against results on different volumes @xcite ) the small finite - volume effects ( @xmath73 0.75% in @xmath55 )",
    "can be removed from our data with negligible residual error .",
    "figure  [ f : chiextrap ] compares our fit with our partially quenched data for @xmath55 .",
    "the data appear quite linear to the eye .",
    "indeed , linear fits change our result for the quark masses by only @xmath74 to @xmath75 , depending on the fit range chosen and whether or not the correlated decay constants are fit simultaneously .",
    "however , since the statistical errors in our data are so small , the nonlinearities from chiral logs and higher order analytic terms are crucial for obtaining good fits : linear fits have @xmath76 .",
    "nonlinear fits have a confidence level of 0.28 , are crucial to obtaining gasser - leutwyler parameters and affect the decay constants by @xmath77@xmath78 .     and @xmath79 as a function of @xmath80 .",
    "we show results from two lattices : a coarse lattice with sea quark masses @xmath81 , @xmath22 , and a fine lattice with @xmath82 , @xmath25 .",
    "three sets of `` kaon '' points with @xmath83 , are plotted for each lattice .",
    "`` pion '' points have @xmath84 .",
    "the solid lines come from a fit to all the data ( not just that plotted ) .",
    "the statistical errors in the points , as well as the variation in the data with sea quark masses are not visible on this scale .",
    "the green dashed lines give the continuum fit described in the text , and the magenta vertical dotted line gives the physical @xmath85 obtained.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we extrapolate / interpolate in mass on the coarse and fine lattices separately to find the lattice values of the light and strange masses that give @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "we get @xmath88 = 0.0390(1)(20 ) , @xmath89 = 0.00141(1)(8 ) on the coarse lattices and 0.0272(1)(12 ) and 0.000989(3)(40 ) on the fine , where errors are statistical and systematic .",
    "the systematic errors are dominated by the chiral extrapolation / interpolation , estimated by varying the fits , and the scale uncertainty ( em effects account for the slight difference with  @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively one can extrapolate the chiral fit parameters to the continuum , setting taste - violating parameters zero , and then perform the chiral extrapolation / interpolation to the physical masses .",
    "this is shown as the dashed green lines in fig .",
    "[ f : chiextrap ] .",
    "the methods give final  masses that differ by less than 2% .",
    "we choose the first method for the central values and include the variation with method in the systematic error .",

    "figure  [ f:2mb_mups ] shows coarse - lattice data for this splitting .",
    "the results are 2% high , but this is also our estimate of discretisation errors in the calculation ( we do not expect sensitivity to taste - violation  @xcite ) .",
    "this quantity then provides a check of our @xmath0 determination at the 20% level because the experimental splitting varies only by @xmath99 15% in changing from @xmath3 to @xmath0 .",

    "<S> the simulations have degenerate @xmath1 and @xmath2 quarks with masses @xmath6 as low as @xmath7 , and two different values of the lattice spacing . the bare lattice quark masses obtained are converted to the @xmath8 scheme using perturbation theory at @xmath9@xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> our results are : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , where the errors are from statistics , simulation , perturbation theory , and electromagnetic effects , respectively . </S>"
