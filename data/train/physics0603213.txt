    "but those with minimum circularity next to the separatrix ?",
    "the deviation of the matrix elements from the transition amplitudes between bohr orbits can conceptually be understood in terms of orbit geometry and transition trajectory .",
    "we will find that orbit geometry provides a scaling whereas the transition trajectory gives rise to an interference effect .",
    "consider an electron orbiting along an @xmath50 sommerfeld ellipse .",
    "as shown in appendix b , its instantaneous acceleration consists of a radial part and a `` centripetal '' part ,    @xmath81    furthermore , the electron s _ average _ centripetal acceleration is proportional to the orbit s semiminor axis ,    @xmath82    we first discuss the top matrix element in each column in fig .",
    "1 , just below the diagonal . it represents a comutant transition between neighbor ellipses with the least deviation from circularity . for these orbits we will , in an approximate treatment , consider only the average centripetal acceleration , neglecting the radial contribution . by eqs .",
    "( 15 ) , ( 13 ) and ( 1 ) the ratio of acceleration in an @xmath50 sommerfeld ellipse and the @xmath10th bohr orbit is    @xmath83    according to bohr s first postulate , no radiation is emitted or absorbed while the electron keeps orbiting along the @xmath50 or @xmath84 sommerfeld ellipse",
    ". however , emission or absorption occurs for an @xmath85 transition .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the average acceleration during the _ transition _ is some average of the average acceleration in both orbits . in the present approximation",
    "we employ the simplest average  the arithmetic mean@xcite .",
    "it yields for a comutant , @xmath86 transition    @xmath87    for the top matrix element in each column of fig .",
    "( 17a ) is 95% accurate or better .",
    "the approximation improves with increasing @xmath10to the right in fig .",
    "1but gets worse with decreasing @xmath49down toward the separatrix .",
    "it ceases for transitions that involve orbits with @xmath88 ( line ellipses)next to the separatrix .    in fig .",
    "1 the top matrix elements fall on a slightly concave trend - curve which approaches the diagonal line of the corresponding transition amplitudes @xmath89 . in the large-@xmath10 limit where bohr s correspondence principle holds ,",
    "the top matrix elements merge with the transition amplitudes between bohr orbits , @xmath90 .",
    "this is also obtained from the approximation ( 17a ) in the large-@xmath10 limit where @xmath91 .",
    "a visualization of _ comutant _ transitions between neighbor orbits is facilitated by fig .",
    "2(ab ) . the electron s trajectory during a transition between bohr orbits ( dashed ) must be some spiral ( not shown ) between those circles .",
    "similarly , the transition trajectory between the sommerfeld orbits must be an elliptical spiral , connecting smoothly the outer and inner ellipse .",
    "note that the larger ellipse completely encompasses the smaller ellipse , akin to the larger bohr orbit s complete enclosure of the smaller one .",
    "therefore a comutant transition between sommerfeld ellipses can be considered as essentially a transition between bohr orbits but geometrically scaled by the ratio of minor axes , eq .",
    "( 17a ) .",
    "the situation is quite different for a _ contramutant _ transition , illustrated in fig .",
    "what is a simple inward spiral between bohr orbits , @xmath92 , now becomes an `` exotic '' transition from the long slim to the short fat sommerfeld orbit , @xmath93 , where the electron has to move _ outside _ the larger ellipse to reach the smaller one .",
    "thus , in contrast to transitions between bohr orbits , where the intra - orbital trajectory constructively contributes to the emission or absorption of radiation , the extra - orbital trajectory in a contramutant transition diminishes the radiation through partial cancellation .",
    "this leads , qualitatively , to small values of the contramutant matrix elements , falling beneath the separatrix in fig . 1 .    the pattern in fig .",
    "1 , where the matrix elements at both the top _ and _ bottom of each column originate from transitions between the fattest ellipses and those toward the separatrix from gradually slimmer ellipses , suggests that the minor - axis scaling holds not only for comutant transitions , eq .",
    "( 17a ) , but also for the contramutant transitions .",
    "both these influences ",
    "orbit scaling and cancellation due to extra - orbital transition trajectory  are contained in an empirical approximation for the contramutant matrix elements ,    @xmath94    with a fudge factor @xmath95 .",

    "( 17a ) but with a negative contribution for the long slim ellipse .",
    "it approximates the bottom matrix elements reasonably well  except @xmath96 which involves a line ellipse .",
    "this finding may lend support to the notion of counter - radiative effects from extra - orbital transition trajectories .    to demonstrate both approximations we compare the transition amplitude @xmath97 , eq .",
    "( 11@xmath38 ) , with the two largest matrix elements in the third column of fig .",
    "1 , that is , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , and with the bottom member , @xmath100 .",
    "their fraction of @xmath101 is 83% , 61% , and 11% , respectively .",
    "the scaled fractions , eqs .",
    "( 17ab ) , are 84% , 54% , and 12% .",
    "figure 2(abc ) shows the corresponding elliptical orbits , together with the ( dashed ) bohr orbits , for an assessment of intra - orbital and extra - orbital transition trajectories .    while eqs .",
    "( 17ab ) approximate well the top and bottom matrix elements in the columns of fig .",
    "1 , their accuracy deteriorates for the matrix elements toward the separatrix .",
    "the reason is the increasing slenderness of the involved ellipses , culminating in line orbits .",
    "the ellipses slenderness gives rise to stronger overtones ( higher fourier coefficients ) of the radial oscillations whose contribution to the acceleration , eq .",
    "( 14 ) , have been neglected in the minor - axis scaling , eq .",
    "( 16 ) .",
    "going beyond the inspection of sommerfeld ellipses , more quantitative insight into matrix elements is obtained by the shape of the radial wavefunctions , shown , for the three above cases , in fig .",

    "( 12 ) ; the sum of positive ( negative ) areas between the radial axis and the curve above ( beneath ) visualizes the matrix element . in a sense",
    "the matrix elements can be regarded as resulting from interference of the weighted wavefunctions ",
    "constructive in the case @xmath102 , less so for @xmath103 , and considerably destructive for @xmath104 .",
    "it may well be that such wavefunction interference and the scaled trajectory effects , considered above , are merely different manifestations of the same radiation dynamics .",
    "max born@xcite came close to the present approach of continuous changes inside the atom with his observation that differential quotients in the large-@xmath10 limit of quantum transitions correspond to difference quotients in the small-@xmath10 regime ,    @xmath105    the quantity @xmath106 is differentially related to a classical ( continuous ) orbital quantity ,    @xmath107    where @xmath108 is a coefficient of proportionality .",

    "( 5 ) and ( 11 ) .",
    "it is tempting to determine the transition analogues of other orbital quantities of the old bohr model , such as the period of revolution ,    @xmath114    and the orbital speed ,    @xmath115    here @xmath116 is the fine - structure constant and @xmath117 is the speed of light . by eq .",

    "( 10 ) , must be quantities of the radiation zone .",
    "in contrast , it seems likely that the transition period @xmath125 relates to the near zone between orbits @xmath10 and @xmath21 .",

    "the transition speed @xmath130 is very slow when the electron transition occurs between high neighbor orbits but very fast when the electron transits from a high orbit to the ground state .",
    "however , for all practical purposes @xmath130 will not exceed the speed of light @xmath131@xcite these findings suggest that , with an inward transition of the electron , the transition speed @xmath130 is the ( negative)@xcite average radial _ _  speed of the nascent photon _ _ in the near zone , that is , between electron orbits @xmath10 and @xmath132 by this interpretation the photon starts from rest , @xmath133 , at the beginning of the electron transition .",
    "the transition period @xmath125 can be regarded as the time interval during which the nascent photon `` peels off '' ( decouples ) from the inward spiraling electron .",
    "the fresh photon will keep accelerating beyond the near zone until it reaches the speed of light @xmath117 in the radiation zone .",
    "when directions are reversed , the same scenario must describe the `` death '' of an absorbed photon .",

    "the transition speed , @xmath135 , represents the ( inward ) average radial speed of the moribund photon between electron orbits 2 and 1 .",
    "despite its initial successes ( balmer formula , space quantization , fine - structure formula ) the orbit - based old quantum theory of bohr and sommerfeld had been insufficient in regard to the atom s magnetic properties ( zeeman effect ) , the intensity of the spectral lines , the stability of the hydrogen - molecule ion , @xmath136 , and the @xmath137 atom . as we know now , with the benefit of hindsight , one of the reasons for these shortcomings was the ignorance of electron spin",
    "however , in the early 1920s it was suspected , chiefly by pauli , heisenberg and born@xcite , that the failures of the old quantum theory were caused by the fallacy of the very concept of electron orbits .    in his article on matrix mechanics",
    "heisenberg@xcite categorically rejected the notion of electron orbits as unobservable in principle . in the spirit of positivist philosophy he instead proposed that any theory in physics should involve only relationships between fundamentally observable quantities , such as frequency and intensity of spectral lines .",
    "the present approach  a `` _ _ new _ _ old quantum theory''obtains both spectral frequencies and intensities from electron orbits .",
    "how is that possible ?",
    "it has been pointed out@xcite that heisenberg disobeyed his own demand by invoking fundamentally unobservable quantities  virtual oscillators  in his theory .",
    "something similar occurs in schrdinger s wave mechanics where wavefunctions @xmath138 play a central role but are , by themselves , unobservable .",
    "the orbit conundrum is readily resolved , though , if we regard quantum orbits not as observable spatial descriptions ",
    "the notion of `` ring atoms '' in the bohr model or `` needle atoms '' for @xmath88 sommerfeld orbits contradicts all experience  but merely as entities to _ calculate _ observable quantities .",
    "this interpretation gives such _ virtual orbits _ in the new - old quantum theory a status equivalent to the virtual oscillators in matrix mechanics or to the wavefunctions in wave mechanics .",
    "it also renders the oft - mentioned incompatibility of quantum orbits with the heisenberg uncertainty principle immaterial .",
    "the present modification of the bohr model , with the first postulate in place but the second postulate omitted , regards both the orbital and transitional motion of the electron as _ continuous _ processes .",
    "they differ merely in the action variable,@xcite alluded to in the introduction .",
    "motion on an orbit trajectory is accompanied by constant action , @xmath139 , and contrary , motion on a transition trajectory by continuously changing action , @xmath140 . in place of bohr s two postulates we can rephrase their essence more succinctly : _ electrodynamic phenomena occur only in processes with continuously changing action variable_. this automatically exempts the stationary states from electrodynamics , restricting the latter to quantum transitions .",
