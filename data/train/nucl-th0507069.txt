    "description of spectroscopic properties for a many body nuclear system is one of the most interesting aims of theoretical nuclear studies .",
    "some of such properties are obtainable by using only few degrees of freedom .",
    "thus the liquid drop model @xcite tries to describe the basic quadrupole collective properties by using a harmonic liquid drop whose surface vibrates with small amplitudes around an equilibrium spherical shape .",
    "few years later another two solvable simple formalisms have been launched namely the jean - wilets model for gamma unstable nuclei @xcite and the davydov filippov ( dv ) model of triaxial rigid rotor @xcite .",
    "although these models are not able to describe the complex details of nuclear spectra they have the big merit to define the framework and to place reference landmarks in the field . indeed , many of the improvements proposed interpret their results by considering the departure from the reference picture provided by the simple models mentioned before .",
    "thus , the first phenomenological model which goes beyond both the liquid drop and df models is the vibration rotation model @xcite where the drop surface may oscillate around a static deformed shape .",
    "the anharmonic terms in the quadrupole shape coordinates are added to the liquid drop for the first time by greiner and gneuss @xcite .",
    "this anharmonic model was extensively used to describe various types of spectra , gamma unstable , gamma stable , triaxial shapes in several publications @xcite .",
    "the drawback of this model is the large number of parameters involved although they depend smoothly on the atomic mass number . a much smaller number of parameters is used by the coherent state model ( csm)@xcite which treats three interacting rotational bands within a restricted collective space defined through angular momentum projection technique , from three deformed states : one of them is describing the deformed ground state and is of an axial symmetric coherent function and the other two are simple polynomial excitations of the ground state determined by requiring the three states to be mutually orthogonal .",
    "csm exploits the semi - classical features of coherent states which results in obtaining a suitable description for states of high angular momentum .",
    "it also provides a unified description of near vibrational , transitional and of well deformed nuclei .",
    "another interesting phenomenological model is the interacting boson approximation which uses besides the quadrupole bosons a monopole one @xcite .",
    "the model hamiltonian is conserving the total number of bosons which as a matter of fact is limited to half the number of valence nucleons from the nucleus under consideration . by construction , the hamiltonian accounts for one of the symmetries o(6 ) , su(5 ) and su(3 ) .",
    "consequently , the nuclear states are just the irreducible representations for these extreme symmetries . however , to describe nuclei departing from these symmetries additional terms are to be added which blurs the primary beauty of the model .",
    "the phenomenological descriptions involving anharmonic boson hamiltonians make use either of approximate methods or of diagonalization procedures to get the desired eigenvalues . in the latter case",
    "the procedure is difficult to be applied when we are close to the picture where the results are very slowly convergent against increasing the basis dimension . on the other hand ,",
    "when an approximate approach is used one does not know how reliable it is .",
    "in other words , we do nt know how far the obtained result is from the exact one .",
    "the same difficulties are encountered also in microscopic formalisms .",
    "the microscopic theories interpret the experimental data in terms of single particle motion .",
    "thus , the collective motion is defined in terms of individual degrees of freedom .",
    "the random phase approximation ( rpa ) or boson expansions are defining boson operators in terms of bifermionic operators and then the hamiltonian and transition operators are written as series of the rpa bosons @xcite .",
    "the convergence properties of the boson series and the magnitude of the ignored `` rest '' , when a truncation is performed , can be evaluated only for exactly solvable models .",
    "the most known solvable microscopic models are those of moszkowski @xcite , lipkin - meshkov @xcite and one level pairing hamiltonian @xcite . applying for example , one of the above mentioned approaches to a solvable model and comparing the results with the corresponding exact output one may conclude upon the validity of the procedure adopted .",
    "it should be stressed the fact that using a realistic hamiltonian instead of a solvable one , one expects that many of the features are at least qualitatively preserved .",
    "it is worth mentioning that for phenomenological boson models including high anharmonicities exact results are lacking . in a previous publication",
    "we studied three fourth order boson hamiltonians which are exactly solvable@xcite . for two of them",
    "we analyzed the possibility of classifying the states describing the intrinsic degrees of freedom in rotational bands .    in the present paper",
    "we continue the project started in our previous paper and study semi - classically a sixth order boson hamiltonian which is exactly solvable .",
    "results for the exact trajectories , their periods and quantization are presented in an analytical form .",
    "interesting results for the transmission probability through a barrier are obtained within the wkb approach .",
    "the formalism and final results are presented according to the following plan . in section",
    "ii , a sextic boson hamiltonian is chosen .",
    "this is treated within a time dependent variational principle approach in section iii .",
    "the quantization of one periodic coordinate and the semi - classical spectrum is given for several distinct energy regions in section iv .",
    "the main results and final conclusions are collected in section v.",
    "in the present paper we shall treat semi - classically a sixth order quadrupole boson hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) with @xmath5 , denotes the creation ( annihilation ) quadrupole boson operator and @xmath6 writing the high order boson terms , involved in @xmath7 , in a normal order it results that the model hamiltonian does not commute with the boson number operator @xmath8 in what follows we are interested in solving the time dependent variational principle ( tdvp ) equations @xmath9 when the variational state @xmath10 spans the whole space of the boson states , solving the equation ( 2.4 ) is equivalent to solving the time dependent equation associated to the model hamiltonian @xmath7 .",
    "the classical features encountered by @xmath7 can be described by restricting the space of @xmath10 to the coherent states : @xmath11|0\\rangle . \\label{psi}\\ ] ] here the boson vacuum state is denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "the function @xmath10 depends on the complex parameters @xmath13 and their complex conjugates @xmath14 .",
    "these parameters play the role of classical phase space coordinates whose equations of motion are provided by the tdvp equations .",
    "it is convenient to have the classical equations of motion in a canonical form . in order to touch this goal",
    "we perform the following change of variables @xmath15 up to an additive constant , @xmath16 , the classical energy function , defined as the average value of the model hamiltonian on the coherent state @xmath10 , has the expression : @xmath17 where the following notations have been used : @xmath18 the nice feature of the classical energy function @xmath19 consists of the fact that it does not contain powers of momenta higher than two , although we started with a high order boson hamiltonian .",
    "it is worth mentioning that similar time dependent approaches are also used for treating many body systems , when for example a hartree fock or an rpa approximation @xcite is performed . in contradistinction to those formalisms where the classical coordinates , parameterizing the trial wave function , are small expansion parameters , here no approximation is made in deriving the classical equations of motion from the variational principle of eq.(2.4 )    the objective of the next section is to study the classical motion of the system associated to the classical energy function @xmath20",
    "the classical energy expressed in terms of the polar coordinates @xmath21 associated to the plane ( @xmath22 ) , looks like : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the potential energy which contains in addition to the potential used in the previous publication , a sextic term : @xmath25 for @xmath26 , depending on the coefficients involved , the potential energy function exhibits either two or no extreme points . in the first situation the ordering of the maximum and minimum points is decided by the relative signs of the defining coefficients a , d and f. here we study the case @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 which defines a potential having first a maximum and then a minimum . the other ordering situation will be considered in a subsequent work . throughout this paper",
    "the applications are made with the following values :    @xmath30    there are two constants of the motion , the energy : @xmath31 and the third component of the angular momentum , @xmath32 for the sake of completeness we give also the expressions of the other two components of angular momentum @xmath33 these components generate a classical @xmath34 algebra with the multiplication operation : @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the poisson brackets and @xmath37 the antisymmetric unit tensor .",
    "@xmath38 might be obtained as average values on @xmath10 ( see eq . ( 2.5 ) ) of angular momentum components operators @xmath39 acting on a boson space @xcite .",
    "these operators generate a boson @xmath40 algebra .",
    "the correspondence @xmath41\\to ( 1/i)\\{,\\}$ ] realizes a homeomorphism of the two algebras mentioned above .",
    "the existence of the constant of motion @xmath19 is a consequence of the fact the classical equations of motion are obtained through the variational principle equation ( 2.4 ) . on the other hand",
    "the equation @xmath42 holds since in the quantal picture the conservation law equation @xmath43=0 $ ] takes place .",
    "the classical system has two constants of motion @xmath19 and @xmath44 and two degrees of freedom @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "therefore the system is fully integrable and consequently analytical solutions for trajectories are expected . as a matter of fact",
    "this is one of the aims of the present investigation .",
    "note that @xmath47 plays the role of the mass , @xmath48 of a classical non - relativistic particle moving in a central force field .",
    "also we note that when the sixth power term in @xmath45 is missing one obtains the classical energy function used in our previous publication @xcite .",
    "moreover the classical energy may be viewed as a counterpart of a microscopic hamiltonian including a two body monopole - monopole interaction . in that case",
    "the coordinate @xmath45 signifies the classical image of a collective microscopic coordinate @xcite .    eliminating the angular variable in eq.([hasrond ] ) one obtains : @xmath49 where @xmath50 @xmath51 is the effective potential energy given by : @xmath52 since @xmath44 is the third component of the intrinsic angular momentum , this is the classical counterpart of the @xmath53 quantum number of the liquid drop model .",
    "having this feature in mind we quantize it by the restriction @xmath54 replacing @xmath44 by its quantized expression , the effective potential becomes : @xmath55 for @xmath56 , @xmath57 exhibits a two minima shape . for the critical value @xmath58",

    "we notice that the first equation ( [ dtdteta ] ) provides the dependence of time on the radial coordinate r. the analytical result for this dependence is given in appendix a. by an inversion operation one obtains @xmath45 as a function of time . inserting this in eq.(3.5 ) and integrating the resulting equation one obtains @xmath46 as function of time .",
    "the two functions of time @xmath45 and @xmath46 are periodic . however , their periods are different from each other .",
    "moreover they are not commensurable which results in having open trajectories . here",

    "indeed , one can prove that the two periods have a common expression : @xmath92 where @xmath93 since the hypergeometric function has a simple pole in @xmath94 the period of the motion diverges when the energy approaches @xmath95 from below .",
    "if we calculate the period for @xmath96 , the same divergence is obtained .",
    "for the left well , the integral action given in units of @xmath86 is equal to that formulated for the right well but restricted to the corresponding energy interval : @xmath97 the action for a trajectory of energy @xmath98 lying in the right well consists of two terms : @xmath99 it turns out that @xmath100 is an integer number , namely @xmath101 thus , the final expression for the integral action for a trajectory from the right well is @xmath102 we notice that @xmath103 @xmath104 @xmath105 for @xmath106 , but @xmath107",

    "the integral action for the case o is : @xmath130      the region shown in fig.1 under the hump is forbidden for the classical motion of r. indeed , there the energy is smaller than @xmath50 which results in having a negative kinetic energy as required by eq.([rpunct ] ) .",
    "note that for this situation , the integral ( [ dtdteta ] ) provides imaginary values for time , i.e , @xmath131 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that by changing the time variable t by @xmath132 the resulting equation can be again integrated since the corresponding effective potential is now @xmath133 while the energy becomes -e .",
    "trajectories in the well @xmath133 are conventionally called virtual .",
    "they are periodic curves in the new variable @xmath134 . moreover this period may be connected with the tunneling time through the hump , for the associated quantum system @xcite .    the period of the motion in the well @xmath133 @xmath135 or in the hump of @xmath50 @xmath135 is given by @xmath136    where @xmath137    the integral action for the inverse of the hump potential is obtained in an analogous way with the procedure described before .",
    "the final result is : @xmath138      in order to emphasize on the complex structure of the classical motion here we give some relevant results for trajectories and their periods .",
    "the coefficients used in our calculations are listed in eq.(3.3 ) .",
    "the shape of trajectories depend on the chosen value of energy . here",
    "we consider a pair of trajectories corresponding to an energy lying close to the maximum value of the effective potential , fig .",
    "2 . one trajectory is lying in the left well , while the other one in the right well .",
    "the two trajectories are quite different . indeed , as shown in fig .",
    "2 , in the left well @xmath45 is running most of the distance @xmath139 in a very short time , than spends a large interval of time to reach the value @xmath140 and to depart from it .",
    "finally @xmath45 is coming quickly back to the value @xmath141 .",
    "the angle @xmath46 undertakes a jump of 2.5 @xmath142 before ending a period of motion . as for the right",
    "well the @xmath45 curve corresponding to e close to @xmath143 is different from the one commented above .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "2 shows that @xmath45 stays longer close to the value @xmath144 and a very short time in the neighborhood of @xmath145 . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath46 changes the speed around the half of period which is at variance with the behavior of the trajectory from the left well .    from fig .",
    "2 we see that after an interval of two periods of @xmath45 , 2 t , the variable @xmath46 covers about 11 @xmath142 in the left well and only 5 @xmath142 in the right well .",
    "this suggests that the trajectory @xmath146 is not closed .",
    "the two trajectories , lying in the left and right well respectively , correspond to e= 6.984326 mev and are presented in fig .",
    "3 . as shown there , the inner and outer trajectories are almost tangent to each other .",
    "when the energy value is far from @xmath147 there is an unreachable region , due to the bump .",
    "the periods of trajectories lying close to the maximum value of @xmath50 are much larger than those staying far from the top of the hump . as a matter of fact",
    ", the period of @xmath45 has a discontinuity for e=@xmath143 , which is pictorially shown in fig .",
    "such a discontinue behavior suggests that @xmath143 is a critical point of a phase transition . in one phase , for a given energy ,",
    "the system may follow one of two @xmath45 trajectories of equal periods , depending on the initial conditions , while in the second phase only one trajectory is possible .",
    "we note that the classical hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "( [ hasrond ] ) does not depend on the angle @xmath46 but only on its conjugate momentum .",
    "consequently there is a constant of motion @xmath44 which is discretetized by the constraint ( [ l3qua ] ) which in fact is a way of quantizing it .",
    "the remaining variable r and its conjugate momentum @xmath148 are both involved in the classical hamiltonian . moreover , as we have seen in the previous section , @xmath45 performs a periodical motion .",
    "consequently , its motion can be quantized by a constraint for the classical action similar to the bohr - sommerfeld condition .",
    "this condition will be applied separately for each region specified in fig.1 .",
    "thus , in the energy region called `` under '' , the quantization equation @xmath149 gives the energy levels @xmath150 situated in the right well below @xmath151 it is remarkable that the above equation is satisfied by @xmath152 this equation says that @xmath153 is a quantal level in both left and right wells .",
    "moreover , below this energy , in the right well there are another l levels .",
    "the quantization condition in the left and right wells of the region `` between '' , reads @xmath154 these equations determine the same energy levels in both wells @xmath155 where @xmath156 the spectrum in the region `` over '' is obtained by solving the equation provided by the quantization condition @xmath157 the virtual quantum states lying in the potential -@xmath50 are obtained from @xmath158 having the integral action for the forbidden energy region , one can calculate the transmission coefficient through the potential barrier . indeed , according to the wkb approximation , the transmission coefficient through the hump is given by the equation : @xmath159      solving eqs .",
    "( 4.1 ) , ( 4.3 ) and ( 4.5 ) satisfied by e , one finds the semiclassical spectrum of the system .",
    "it is instructive to see how many quantum states with energy less than @xmath143 accommodates the left well . the number of states is presented in fig .",
    "5 as a function of angular momentum .",
    "note that for some l , the number of states is the same as for the l+1 case .",
    "the quantal states are tentatively organized in rotational bands in fig .",
    "6 , in a full analogy with the standard definition of the lowest bands within the liquid drop model . as for the right",
    "well the number of states and the rotational bands are shown in figs . 7 and 8 respectively .",
    "figure 7 shows that for @xmath160 the number of states of energy less then @xmath143 is 48 , while for the next 12 angular momenta the number of states in the interval mentioned above is 49 .",
    "intervals for angular momenta for which the same number of states is registered is decreasing and contains only one angular momentum when the maximum for the effective potential disappears .",
    "the `` bands '' in the right well differ the ones from the left well .",
    "indeed , as shown in fig .",
    "8 , the energy spacing is much smaller then in the left well .",
    "this is caused by the fact that the secondary minima of @xmath50 are very close to each other , which is consistent with the known fact that superdeformed nuclei exhibit larger moments of inertia .",
    "another difference between the two sets of bands consists of that while in the left well the @xmath161 band is lower in energy than the @xmath162 band in the right well the ordering of the two bands is opposite .    in contradistinction to what happens for real trajectories , the integral action for the virtual states , is a decreasing function of energy . also , the number of states from @xmath133 is a decreasing function of angular momentum ( see fig .",
    "energy levels for the virtual states do not coincide with energy levels corresponding to real states of left and right well . the differences in energy and the period of virtual states satisfy the uncertainty relations .",
    "let us consider the transmission coefficients corresponding to the virtual state of highest energy , the first one under the hump .",
    "these are calculated within the wkb approximation by making use of eq.(47 ) , for a given value of the angular momentum .",
    "the results are given in fig.10 .",
    "it is worth to mention the discontinuity of d(e , l ) given by eq .",
    "( [ del ] ) for some values of l. indeed , going from the values 10 , 23 , 29 , 35 , 40 , 44 , 47 , 50 , 53 to 11 , 24 , 30 , 36 , 41 , 45 , 48 , 51 , 54 , respectively , one achieves a very big jump in magnitude for the transmission coefficient .",
    "this result might have an important consequence for the mechanism of alpha or heavy cluster emission .",
    "indeed , if the alpha s or heavy fragment would be in a state of angular momentum staying in the list from above , its penetration probability would be enlarged and a sizable emission rate could be registered . having in mind the integration limits in eq.(4.7 ) , the transmission coefficient d(e , l ) , associated to the first virtual state depends on the difference between @xmath143 and the state energy . the smaller the difference the larger the transmission coefficient .",
    "increasing the difference quoted above , the transmission coefficient decreases more or less exponentially .",
    "such a dependence may be seen in fig . 11 .",
    "although the present and previous work @xcite use the same formalism to treat two distinct hamiltonians , the results are both technically and physically different from each other .",
    "thus , the fourth order boson hamiltonian used in ref.@xcite yields a classical effective potential which misses the superdeformed minimum . consequently , while here one distinguishes three distinct energy regions , called o , b and u , with topologically different trajectories , in the quoted reference there is only one region of finite trajectories and that correspond to the left well from fig .",
    "all trajectories @xmath163 are periodical .",
    "the period depends on energy .",
    "indeed , increasing the energy from the u to the b region in the right well , there is a smooth variation for period .",
    "the periods associated to trajectories of the same energy but lying in the left and right well respectively , are equal to each other . at the border between the b and the o regions the period is singular , which suggests a phase transition . in the case of four order boson hamiltonian such a transition appear to take place between a phase of periodic orbits and one of open orbits .",
    "although the periods for orbits of left and right b trajectories of similar energies are equal to each other , the time dependence of @xmath45 and @xmath46 coordinates are different , respectively .",
    "the difference is increasing when the energy approaches @xmath164 . as a matter of fact",
    "this reflects the influence of the deformation on trajectories . in this context",
    "one may say that in ref .",
    "@xcite only moderately deformed trajectories show up which results in having in the plot corresponding to fig .",
    "3 only the inner curves",
    ". thus , the superdeformed trajectories are specific to the present formalism .",
    "the absence of periodic orbits for @xmath165 has as consequence the fact that in a plot similar to that from fig .",
    "4 , the descending branch does not exist .",
    "since for the chosen parameters the energy levels are almost equidistant one may expand the effective potentials around the minima and keep only the quadratic terms .",
    "the frequencies characterizing the harmonic motion in the two resulting wells have the expressions : @xmath166^{1/2},\\;\\;k=1,2 \\label{omkl}\\ ] ] where @xmath167 and @xmath168 denote the coordinates of the first and second minimum , respectively .",
    "note that for k=1 , the influence of the sixth order boson term is the @xmath169 term in the above expression while the @xmath170 case exists only if the sixth order term is included .",
    "for the two wells one may define rotational bands in a similar way as in the framework of the liquid drop model .",
    "@xmath171    it is worth mentioning that the first equation ( [ e012 ] ) with k=1 represents a generalization of the variable moment inertia formula @xcite .",
    "when @xmath50 is truncated to the quadratic term , the equation expressing the energy in terms of angular momentum derived in ref.@xcite is obtained .",
    "the above cited equation considered for @xmath170 represents an extension of the variable moment of inertia formula to the superdeformed nuclei .",
    "the second and third equation from ( [ e012 ] ) describe wobbling motions around the states from the ground band .",
    "the results shown in figs . 7",
    ", 8 are missing in ref .",
    "@xcite since there , no right well in the effective potential shows up .",
    "here we presented also the results characterizing the virtual states lying under the bump .",
    "also the transmission coefficients through the bump for a particular energy has been studied as function of both angular momentum and the energy normalized to its maximum value .",
    "the peculiar feature of the model hamiltonian studied so far consists of that it contains only a quadratic dependence on momenta which is consistent with the classical image where the kinetic energy involves only such type of terms .",
    "moreover , six is the maximal order of boson terms which can be analytically treated . from this point of view the present treatment",
    "can not be improved by adding higher order terms .",
    "formalisms dealing with anharmonic boson terms use hamiltonians having , however , powers of momenta higher than two .",
