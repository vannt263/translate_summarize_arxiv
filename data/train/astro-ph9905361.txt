    "attempts at determining the dust geometry around herbig ae / be stars ( haebes ) from ir and mm - wave data have yielded conflicting conclusions . from the shape of the sed , hillenbrand et al .",
    "( 1992 ) suggested that the ir emission from 30 haebes is dominated by optically thick accretion disks .",
    "however , miroshnichenko , ivezi & elitzur ( 1997 ; mie ) successfully modeled the detailed data of eight of these objects with optically thin spherical envelopes in free fall .",
    "worse yet , occasionally the data at different wavelengths from the same source seem in conflict .",
    "mannings & sargent ( 1997 ; ms ) measured the mm - wave emission from seven haebes , including two of the mie sources .",
    "they find that the visual optical depths ( ) required to explain the mm emission with the mie models are at least 220 , at considerable odds with the small @xmath1-band extinction of each source . in particular , mie successfully fitted all @xmath2 100  data with  = 0.4 for mwc 480 and  = 0.3 for mwc 863 , yet ms find that within the context of the mie model , the mm - emission from these sources requires @xmath3 and  = 601 , respectively .",
    "however , mannings and sargent s proposed solution that the emission originates from optically - thick accretion disks yields similar inconsistencies . in this case @xmath4 , and extrapolating the flux from the ms mm measurements produces ir emission that is more than an order of magnitude too weak . for example , for mwc 863 the measured 2.6 mm flux of 13.7 mjy extrapolates to only 0.1 jy at 2.2 , where the observed flux is 4.6 jy .",
    "also , the proposed accretion disks would be optically thick at 10 , where the silicate feature indicates prominent optically thin emission in most of the ms sources .",
    "similar inconsistencies arise from the haebes imaging by di francesco et al.(1994 ; df ) .",
    "irrespective of geometry , the longer the radiation wavelength , the cooler the emitting region is , and since temperature drops with distance from the center , the image size should increase with wavelength .",
    "while this was the case for most sources , the image size of mwc 137 was @xmath5 at 50  and only @xmath6 at 100 .",
    "no single dust configuration can produce a decrease of observed size with wavelength .",
    "we propose a simple solution to the internal inconsistencies that seem to afflict the observations at different wavelengths of some haebes : the dust distribution in these sources has both an extended spherical component , dominating the ir emission , and an embedded compact disk which dominates the mm and sub - mm emission . here",
    "we show that this simple model resolves all the conflicts quite naturally .",
    "the system consists of a star of radius  and effective temperature , surrounded by a geometrically thin and optically thick passive disk extending from  to some outer radius .",
    "in addition , a spherical dusty envelope starts at the radius  corresponding to dust sublimation .",
    "we have analyzed this system with the aid of the scaling theory of ivezi & elitzur ( 1997 ; ie ) and the classical accretion disk theory as adapted to t tau stars by bertout , basri & bouvier ( 1988 ) .",
    "details of our analysis will be reported elsewhere . here",
    "we present detailed model calculations , performed with the code dusty ( ivezi , nenkova & elitzur 1997 ) , that successfully fit the seds of all the stars in the ms sample .",
    "our modeling procedure is similar to mie except that each model flux is the sum of disk and envelope contributions , where the latter includes also the attenuated stellar emission . for any flux distribution @xmath7 introduce the dimensionless , normalized sed @xmath8 , which depends only on dimensionless quantities",
    " luminosities , densities and linear dimensions are irrelevant ( ie ) . the only relevant property of the stellar radiation is its spectral shape , taken from the appropriate kurucz ( 1994 ) model atmosphere . for the dust ,",
    "the only relevant properties are the spectral shapes of the absorption and scattering coefficients , which we take from standard interstellar mix , and the sublimation temperature , which we take as  = 1500  k. dusty performs a self - consistent calculation of the temperature profiles of the disk and the envelope , taking into account both the scattered and attenuated stellar radiation and diffuse envelope emission ; the effect of disk emission on the envelope temperature is negligible for the parameters considered here .",
    "the envelope sed , , is determined by the envelope optical depth , , and the dimensionless profile of its density distribution in terms of @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is distance from the star . here",
    "we employ the simple profile @xmath11 , with @xmath12 as a free parameter , extending from @xmath13 to some @xmath14 . if shadowing by the star is neglected then @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the disk inclination angle , and the disk sed , , is independent of @xmath16 .",
    "the disk is assumed to be optically thick everywhere at the peak of the planckian with the local temperature .",
    "then  has only two free parameters  the temperature and normal optical depth of the disk outer edge , which we denote  and , respectively , the latter specified at 350 . once and",
    "are computed , the observed sed is fitted through @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a free parameter . the final free parameter is @xmath19 , the interstellar extinction to the system .",
    "figure 1 shows our modeling results , including all available data from 1400   to 2.7 mm .",
    "in addition to the iras lrs data when available , the plot for each object contains 2030 data points from various sources .",
    "the model parameters obtained for each star are listed in table 1 .",
    "it is worth noting that the @xmath19 we find are similar to those derived by ms . as is evident from the figure , envelopes with a simple power law density distribution adequately fit almost all sources . in all those cases",
    "the figure displays the model with @xmath20 , but there is considerable freedom in this parameter and successful models can be constructed with @xmath21 as small as  150 . in addition , acceptable fits can be obtained when the power @xmath12 is reduced by as much as 0.5 in most cases .",
    "the largest freedom exists for mwc 758 which lacks lrs data , and we present the two models that bracket the range of @xmath12 ; any value in between is possible .",
    "the one exception is ab aur , this sample s most luminous object , which requires an extended envelope ( @xmath21 = 5000 ) with a broken power law density profile .",
    "indeed , it is the only source in this sample surrounded by a visible nebulosity ( herbig 1960 ) ; the nebulosity size (  1.5 arcmin ) agrees with our model requirements .",
    "a flattening of the density distribution away from the center can be expected at the late evolutionary stages of collapsing clouds ( e.g. , shematovich , shustov & wiebe , 1997 ) .",
    "the key to the resolution of the conflicts outlined above is the great disparity between the disk and envelope temperature profiles .",
    "while heating by stellar radiation produces disk temperature that varies as @xmath22 , the envelope temperature decreases only as @xmath23 for dust opacity @xmath24 . as a result ,",
    "the disk is much cooler than the envelope at all radii at which both exist and can also contain cooler material in spite of being much smaller . both properties",
    "are evident from the top panel of figure 2 , which shows the temperature profiles of the two components in ab aur .",
    "natta ( 1993 ) pointed out that heating by the spherical dusty envelope significantly affects the disk temperature , and our calculations confirm this important point . in figure 1 , the first bump ( around 1 ) in each disk emission reflects the stellar heating , the second is produced by the envelope heating .",
    "but this does not alter the fundamental difference between the temperature profiles of the two components , as the ab aur case shows .",
    "although it is more compact , the disk can be the stronger emitter at long wavelengths so that the sed is dominated by the envelope at ir wavelengths and by the disk at mm wavelengths .",
    "this is the case for all sources in fig .  1 .",
    "this role reversal affects also the wavelength behavior of images . at shorter wavelengths",
    "the image is dominated by the envelope , and the observed size increases with wavelength .",
    "when the sed switches to disk domination , the observed size can decrease because a given temperature occurs on the disk at a much smaller radius than in the envelope .",
    "this effect is evident in figure 2 , which shows the surface brightness profiles of the ab aur model at various wavelengths .",
    "these profiles agree well with imaging observations ( df , marsh et al .",
    "1995 , ms ) .",
    "the finite beam size and dynamic range of any given telescope could result in an apparent size decrease between 10  and 100  in this case .",
    "a switch from envelope to disk domination provides a simple explanation for the otherwise puzzling decrease in the observed size of mwc 137 between 50  and 100 . a similar effect was recently detected also in the dust - shrouded main - sequence star vega .",
    "van der bliek , prusti & waters ( 1994 ) find that its 60  size is @xmath25 , yet 850 imaging by holland et al .",
    "( 1998 ) produced a size of only @xmath26 .",
    "so the dust distribution around vega , too , could have both spherical and disk components .",
    "our models successfully fit the entire ms sample , resolving all the earlier discrepancies . both disk and envelope are crucial components .",
    "a purely spherical distribution could successfully fit each sed , but the cool mm - wave emitting material would have to be placed about 100 times further from the star than the ms observations indicate ( an example is the recent spherical fit for ab aur by henning et al . ,",
    "the compact mm - wave emission observed from these sources can be produced only by the ",
    "classic \" geometrically - thin optically - thick disks , as correctly recognized by mannings & sargent .",
    "but such disks alone are incapable of explaining the observations .",
    "this is evident from figure 1 , which shows the maximum possible emission from this configuration , obtained when a  bare \" disk is observed face - on . in all sources",
    "this emission falls short of observations at @xmath27  5 , mostly by substantial amounts .",
    "the envelope is essential not only for its direct ir flux which dominates the observations at these wavelengths , but also for its indirect effect on the sub - mm and mm - wave emission , which is disk dominated ; the observations at these wavelengths can not be explained without the additional disk heating by the envelope .",
    "our detailed model results depend on the simplifying assumptions , but the main conclusions seem robust : the density distribution contains two distinct components , one optically thick , cool and compact , the other optically thin , warmer and more extended .",
    "the spherical idealization is not essential for the latter since the envelopes can be flattened and even distorted into irregular shapes before severely affecting the results .",
    "recently chiang & goldreich ( 1997 ; cg ) pointed out that the optically thin emission from the surface layer of an optically thick disk can significantly affect the sed , and in principle this layer could fulfil the role of the envelope advocated here .",
    "however , the emission from the cg layer can be shown equivalent to that from a spherical envelope with optical depth  = 0.8/  and density profile @xmath28 for @xmath29 and @xmath30 thereafter .",
    "detailed model calculations with these equivalent envelopes show that they can not fit the ms sources .",
    "in particular , all the ms sources require @xmath31 for their observed fluxes but only have /  0.01 ( table 1 ) ; i.e. , the column of optically thin dust contained in the disk surface layer is only  10% of what the observations require , and we are justified in neglecting this layer in our haebes model calculations . on the other hand , in t tau stars ,",
    "the subject of the cg study , /  is an order of magnitude larger than for haebes ( because  is lower ) and the surface layer becomes a significant component .",
    "the ms sources hd 245185 and mwc 758 are potential exceptions because good fits to their seds are possible with rather flat density profiles and modest optical depths .",
    "such envelopes could be made equivalent to cg layers if the parameters of the cg model are scaled to the haebes environment keeping the basic assumptions intact . settling the issue with certainty for these two cases",
    "requires a 2d radiative transfer code , which we are currently developing . in all other sources",
    ", our conclusion about the negligible role of the disk surface layer seems secure .",
    "almost all the envelopes have @xmath32 , therefore their material is largely atomic . with standard dust abundance ,",
    "the envelope column densities are   @xmath33 . all stars in this sample have  2 , therefore   cm and the densities at the envelope inner regions are  7 @xmath34 . in contrast with ms ,",
    "the df selection criterion was high luminosities . since  scales with @xmath35",
    ", the df sources should have more extended envelopes , as observed .",
    "the envelope mass strongly depends on its outer radius , and this parameter is rather poorly constrained . with @xmath21 = 1000 , which was employed in the displayed fits ,",
    "envelope masses range from   for the sources with @xmath36 to   for the sources with @xmath28 .",
    "however , these mass estimates decrease sharply for smaller values of @xmath21 , which are possible in all cases .",
    "the one exception is ab aur , where there is little freedom in the outer radius , and the model parameters give an envelope mass of 0.03 , same as a recent estimate by henning et al ( 1998 ) .",
    "the power @xmath12 = 2 could indicate outflow with constant velocity ; indeed , n  v emission from ab aur was recently modeled with a wind ( bouret , catala & simon 1997 ) .",
    "however , acceptable fits can be produced also with @xmath12 = 3/2 . if this index is interpreted as steady - state accretion to a central mass , the envelope optical depths translate to accretion rates of   yr@xmath37 , similar to those deduced from uv spectra of haebes ( grady et al .",
    "1996 ) and t tau stars ( valenti , basri & johns 1993 ; gullbring et al 1998 ) .",
    "these low rates can not correspond to the main accretion buildup of the star but rather a much later phase , involving small , residual accretion from the environment .",
    "the corresponding accretion luminosities are only  0.1 , justifying their neglect in our calculations .",
    "since the disk is optically thick in our model , its density distribution remains undetermined and we can not improve on the ms estimates of disk masses (   ) .",
    "useful information can be deduced from the parameter @xmath38 because it is easy to show that @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the disk fractional contribution to the overall luminosity .",
    "our calculations automatically determine @xmath40 in each case , allowing us to deduce @xmath16 from the model fit for @xmath38 .",
    "if the disk extends all the way to the stellar surface then @xmath40 = 0.4 for the ab aur model = 0.25 .",
    "] which translates to @xmath16 = 80  for this source , similar to the 76  that ms deduced from the disk elliptical appearance .",
    "however , following the same procedure for all other stars produces @xmath41 in each case .",
    "since an edge - on orientation for every single disk in this sample is highly unlikely we conclude that @xmath40 can not be as large as this procedure implies for all the systems .",
    "indeed , central holes would drastically reduce @xmath40 because of the steep dependence of disk luminosity on the radius of the disk inner edge . moving this edge from  to only 2",
    "removes 56% of the stellar luminosity intercepted by the disk , 3results in a 72% removal .",
    "central holes of virtually any size would sharply decrease @xmath40 , resulting in a more plausible distribution of inclination angles .",
    "such holes would not impact any other model result because they remove only the hottest disk material whose contribution to the observed flux is negligible in all cases .",
    "the sizes of these holes can not be determined from the modeling , but their existence seems an unavoidable conclusion .",
    "the discrepancies among previous haebes studies underscore the importance of combining multi - wavelength data in an integrative approach .",
    "single wavelength observations , however detailed , never fully reconstruct the geometry of dust distribution . at @xmath27  3",
    "the observed radiation is scattering dominated because dust emission would require temperatures higher than sublimation .",
    "scattered photons trace the density distribution , so images at these wavelengths reveal the actual geometry  but only close to the center , to scattering optical depth  1 .",
    "in contrast , radiation at longer wavelengths can map much farther regions because it is dominated by dust emission .",
    "however , the emission is predominantly governed by the dust temperature distribution , which primarily reflects distance from the central star and thus tends to be spherically symmetric even when the density distribution is not . by example",
    ", images of the nebulosity around the late - type star irc+10216 are elongated at @xmath27  34  yet spherically symmetric at longer wavelengths ( ivezi & elitzur 1996 ) .",
    "recent nicmos images of young stellar objects show complex morphologies ( padgett et al.1999 ) , and there is no reason to believe they should be simpler for haebes .",
    "nevertheless , resolving such details does not alter the measured sed .",
    "the model parameters deduced here can be expected to provide a reasonable description of the envelope properties when small - scale structure is averaged out .",
