    "at the heart of quantum technologies lies the fact that quantum mechanical systems show features , with no classical counterpart , that may be employed as resources to perform specific tasks better or faster than within the classical realm  @xcite . in the context of quantum optics , genuine quantum traits of optical systems have led to the emergence of the concept of _ nonclassicality _ , which characterizes states whose effects are not achievable with classical light  @xcite . in particular , _ linear _ models ( here intended as systems that induce linear transformations of the bosonic mode operators ) have attracted much attention in the past decades , due to the development of experimental platforms able to implement them .",
    "in fact , the generation of non - classical light , especially in the form of squeezed beams , has proven to be an enabling resource for a variety of quantum technological applications @xcite .",
    "recently , alternative experimental platforms have been developed that can also be coherently controlled and described as single - mode bosonic systems  including trapped ions @xcite , optomechanical systems @xcite , atoms in optical lattices @xcite , and hybrid systems @xcite .",
    "the latter naturally embody a playground to discuss and test the generation and characterization of genuine quantum features .",
    "in particular , they offer the unique opportunity to consider _ nonlinear _ ( or anharmonic ) models , given that the possibility to host non - linearities is within reach of current technologies , in particular for trapped ions @xcite and optomechanical systems @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it has been shown that the inclusion of nonlinearities in the oscillator potential uncovers new possibilities to generate nonclassical states @xcite . however , a general framework that encompasses these possibilities remains elusive and in particular a thorough quantitative assessment of the link between nonlinearity and nonclassicality still lacks .",
    "the aim of this work is to investigate in details the idea that nonlinearity is a general resource to generate nonclassicality in single - mode bosonic systems constituted of anharmonic oscillators .",
    "in particular , we will focus on a quantitative assessment of the phenomenon , as we critically consider specific quantifiers of nonclassicality and nonlinearity .",
    "in fact , identifying proper measures of these quantities is crucial by itself and , in particular , different figures of merit exist that capture different features associated to nonclassicality @xcite .",
    "the quantitative connection of the nonlinear behaviour of an oscillatory system and the appearance of nonclassicality has recently been tested , in the context of nano - mechanical resonators , for the duffing oscillator model @xcite . here",
    "we extend such connection and assess its validity for more general scenarios , including three families of exactly solvable non - linear oscillators and a generic sixth order potential .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nonclassnonlin ] we review the main conceptual tools and establish our notation and formalism .",
    "first , we introduce and discuss the two quantitative measures of nonclassicality that will be used throughout the paper , namely entanglement potential and the volume of the negative part of the wigner function . then , we review a recently introduced measure to quantify the nonlinearity of a quantum oscillator @xcite , which in turn is based on an entropic measure of non - gaussianity  @xcite . in section [ sec : potentials ] we analyse the quantitative connection between nonclassicality and nonlinearity for three different nonlinear potentials having an exact solution .",
    "we also highlight some differences between the two measures of nonclassicality ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : harmoscpert ] we address generic ( symmmetric ) anharmonic potential by considering fourth- and sixth - order perturbations to the harmonic one . in sec .",
    "[ sec : out ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "we consider a bosonic system with a single degree of freedom , such as a one - dimensional oscillator or a single - mode of a bosonic field . since we deal with single - mode systems",
    ", we will not discuss any notion related to entanglement or other nonclassical correlations .    in the most general terms",
    ", a quantum state is said to be nonclassical if the methods of classical statistics fail to describe its properties and phenomenology . in the context of quantum optics this definition",
    "is made precise by using quasiprobability distributions in phase space .",
    "here we are not only interested in _ criteria _ for nonclassicality , but we seek for a _ quantitative characterization_. an excellent summary on this topic can be found in the introduction of ref .",
    "@xcite .      according to titulaer and glauber  @xcite ,",
    "a quantum state is nonclassical when its @xmath0 function fails to be interpreted as a probability distribution in the phase space ( see also refs .",
    "it has been recently emphasized  @xcite that the @xmath0 function is the only quasiprobability distribution which can give a description that can be completely modelled using classical electrodynamics , therefore supporting the idea that to identify a classical state it is necessary to use the @xmath0 function . in this paper",
    "we dub such fundamental notion as _ p - nonclassicality_.    the best known way to quantify p - nonclassicality is the nonclassical depth  @xcite : it quantifies , operationally , the amount of thermal noise that is needed in order to render the @xmath0 function of a given state a well - behaved probability distribution and the corresponding state classical .",
    "this measure however is not fully suited for our purposes : in fact , while we will be interested in establishing a quantitative hierarchy of pure non - gaussian states in terms of their nonclassicality at a set nonlinearity of a given potential , it has been proven that such states all saturate the nonclassical depth  @xcite , i.e. they are equally and maximally nonclassical according to this measure .",
    "this obstacle can be overcome by considering the following .",
    "it has long been known that coherent states are the only pure states that produce uncorrelated outputs when mixed by a passive linear - optics device  @xcite .",
    "specifically , p - nonclassicality has been identified as a necessary condition for having entangled states at the output of a beam splitter  @xcite and quantitative relations have been identified between non - classicality and entanglement @xcite or discord - like correlations more in general @xcite .",
    "the idea of quantifying nonclassicality of a single mode state as the two mode entanglement at the output of a linear optic device was introduced by asbth et al .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the optimal entangler is just a ( 50:50 ) beam splitter with vacuum as an auxiliary state . by restricting to this setup ,",
    "nonclassicality of the input state becomes a necessary and sufficient condition for output entanglement . as a consequence ,",
    "entanglement at the output of a beam splitter may be used as a faithful quantitative measure of p - nonclassicality .",
    "this measure is usually referred to as entanglement potential @xmath1 and it is defined as @xmath2=e{\\mathopen{}\\mathclose\\bgroup\\originalleft } [ \\hat{b } { \\mathopen{}\\mathclose\\bgroup\\originalleft } ( \\rho   \\otimes |0 \\rangle \\langle 0 | { \\aftergroup\\egroup\\originalright } ) \\hat{b}^{\\dag } { \\aftergroup\\egroup\\originalright}],\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the density matrix of the state under scrutiny , @xmath4 is the vacuum state at the ancillary port of the beam splitter , @xmath5 is the beam splitter operator , and @xmath6 $ ] is a suitable measure of entanglement . our analysis will be concerned with the ground state of a given hamiltonian model . by dealing with pure states ,",
    "@xmath6 $ ] can be chosen , with no ambiguity , as the the entanglement entropy .",
    "this choice corresponds to the _ entropic entanglement potential _ defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , which has been evaluated by truncating the dimension of the hilbert space to a suitable dimensione , ensuring the normalization of the state before and after the beam - splitter .      while the @xmath0 function can be a singular object ,",
    "the wigner function is always well behaved , even if it can attain negative values .",
    "negativities of the wigner function associated with a given state defines the so - called _",
    "@xmath7-nonclassicality _ , which is , however , only a sufficient condition for p - nonclassicality .",
    "it follows that there are w - classical states which are p - nonclassical : displaced squeezed states are a remarkable example .",
    "the notion of @xmath7-nonclassicality has gained an operational meaning as follows : the evolution of a system which is in a @xmath7-nonclassical state can not be efficiently simulated with classical resources  @xcite . in order to quantify @xmath7-nonclassicality we use the volume of the negative part of the wigner function  @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are phase - space variables , and",
    "@xmath11 is the wigner function of the state under scrutiny .",
    "we will make use of the following normalized version of this measure @xmath12 which gives @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "let us stress that the @xmath7 and @xmath0-nonclassicality single out different quantum features . in particular , the hudson theorem  @xcite guarantees that the sole pure states with a positive wigner function are gaussian ones , i.e. squeezed coherent states .",
    "hence , there exist pure states that have zero @xmath7-nonclassicality ( _ e.g. _ , squeezed states ) but non - zero @xmath0-nonclassicality . in this sense the entanglement potential",
    "can reveal more detailed features of quantumness , as we will see below .",
    "note that measures of @xmath7-nonclassicality based on the geometric distance between quantum states have also been introduced @xcite .",
    "the first idea to quantify the nonlinearity ( inteded as the _ anharmonicity character _ ) of a potential would be defining a distance between potential functions and the reference harmonic potential .",
    "however , this is in general not feasible , since potentials do not need to be integrable functions .",
    "a different approach follows from the fact that ground states and equilibrium states of anharmonic potentials are not gaussian , as opposed to those of a quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "we can thus choose to quantify nonlinearity by the non - gaussianity of the ground state of a given hamiltonian model  @xcite .",
    "the measure of non - gaussianity used for this goal is the entropic measure introduced in @xcite .",
    "here we shall briefly review these measures .",
    "the covariance matrix of a single - mode bosonic system prepared in a state @xmath3 is defined as  @xcite @xmath14 = \\frac{1}{2 } \\langle \\ { \\hat r_j,\\hat r_k \\ } \\rangle_\\rho - \\langle \\hat r_j \\rangle_\\rho \\langle \\hat r_k \\rangle_\\rho,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the vector of single - mode quadrature operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and the subscript implies that expectation values are calculated over state @xmath3 .",
    "we also define the displacement vector @xmath18 $ ] with components @xmath19 = \\langle \\hat r_k \\rangle_\\rho$ ] .",
    "a gaussian state has a gaussian wigner function . to quantify non - gaussianity of a generic state @xmath3",
    ", a reference gaussian state @xmath20 should be defined .",
    "this is identified as the gaussian state having the same covariance matrix and displacement vector as @xmath3 .",
    "that is @xmath21= { \\mathbf}{\\bar x}[\\rho ] , \\qquad\\sigma[\\tau]=\\sigma[\\rho].\\ ] ]    non - gaussianity can now be defined as the distance between @xmath3 and @xmath20 calculated using , for instance , the quantum relative entropy @xmath22.\\ ] ] we have that @xmath23 iff @xmath24 .",
    "although @xmath25 is not symmetric in its arguments , and thus does not embody a proper metric , it has been used widely to quantify the distinguishability of two states .",
    "this leads to the definition of the entropic measure of non - gaussianity @xmath26 - \\tr { \\mathopen{}\\mathclose\\bgroup\\originalleft } [ \\rho \\ln \\tau { \\aftergroup\\egroup\\originalright } ] = s(\\tau ) - s(\\rho),\\ ] ] where @xmath27 denotes the von neumann entropy and , owing the way @xmath20 is defined , we have that @xmath28 = -\\tr { \\mathopen{}\\mathclose\\bgroup\\originalleft } [ \\rho \\ln \\tau { \\aftergroup\\egroup\\originalright}]$ ] .",
    "this measure satisfies a series of quite useful properties  @xcite : it is additive under the tensor product operation , and invariant under symplectic transformations , which are both very useful for the sake of our analysis .",
    "the von neumann entropy of a single mode gaussian state takes the very simple form @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "thanks to this form , the entropic non - gaussianity becomes @xmath31 which is further simplified for pure states , as @xmath32 .",
    "we consider a generic potential @xmath33 and denote with @xmath34 the ground state of the corresponding hamiltonian .",
    "the first idea to quantify nonlinearity would be again using the geometrical distance between the ground state of the potential and a reference harmonic state , in particular for this purpose the bures metric has also been employed @xcite .",
    "this way of reasoning has a downside because we have to choose a value for the frequency @xmath35 of the reference harmonic oscillator .",
    "the most natural choice is expanding the potential near its minimum and finding @xmath35 as a function of the nonlinear parameters of the potential .",
    "however , determining this frequency is not always straightforward and for some potentials exhbiting more than one minimum it may be even be misleading .    instead of using a metric",
    "we choose to quantify nonlinearity using the entropic non - gaussianity @xmath36 , so that the measure of nonlinearity is defined as @xmath37= \\delta_{\\text{e } } { \\mathopen{}\\mathclose\\bgroup\\originalleft } ( |\\phi\\rangle \\langle \\phi | { \\aftergroup\\egroup\\originalright } ) = h { \\mathopen{}\\mathclose\\bgroup\\originalleft}(\\sqrt{\\det { \\mathbf}{\\sigma}}{\\aftergroup\\egroup\\originalright}),\\ ] ] this equality holds because the ground state is pure and @xmath38 is the covariance matrix of the ground state ( we drop the dependence from the state when obvious ) .",
    "this definition is more appealing than a geometric one because it does not require the determination of a reference potential for @xmath33 , but just the reference gaussian state for the ground state of @xmath33 .",
    "this makes @xmath39 independent of the specific features of the potential , since we do not need to know the behavior of @xmath33 near its minimum to compute the reference frequency .",
    "moreover , @xmath39 inherits the property of the non - gaussianity measure and is invariant under symplectic transformations  @xcite .",
    "this means that @xmath40 assigns the same nonlinearity to oscillators which are displaced , rotated in phase space or squeezed , which is a reasonable property for a measure of nonlinearity .",
    "we now analyze quantitatively the relation between the figures of merit introduced in the previous section , considering three exactly solvable anharmonic oscillators .",
    "the modified harmonic oscillator ( mho ) potential is defined as  @xcite ( throughout this manuscript we choose units such that @xmath41 ) @xmath42 here @xmath43 is a parameter corresponding to the frequency of the unmodified harmonic oscillator , while @xmath44 determines the deformation of the harmonic potential .",
    "the effects of this parameter on the shape of the potential is appreciated from fig .",
    "[ fig : mhopot ] , where @xmath45 is plotted at a set value of @xmath43 for different choices of @xmath44 , showing that an increasing deformation parameter transforms a harmonic potential into a double - well one whose well - depth and separation both increase with @xmath44 .     and @xmath46 ( solid blue ) , @xmath47 ( dotted yellow ) , @xmath48 ( dashed green ) and the harmonic potential with unitary frequency and mass ( dot - dashed orange ) .",

    "the covariance matrix of such least - energy state can be computed straightforwardly to be @xmath51}{1+\\exp[{\\beta^2}/\\alpha ] } & 0 \\\\   0 & \\frac{\\alpha } { 2}-\\frac{\\beta ^2}{1+\\exp[{\\beta ^2}/{\\alpha } ] }   \\end{pmatrix}.\\ ] ] its determinant is @xmath52 with @xmath53 . such dependence on @xmath20 , rather than @xmath43 and @xmath44 independently , is common to @xmath54 and the measure of nonlinearity based on the bures distance ( for the latter , we should choose the unmodified harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath43 as a reference ) .",
    "both measures of nonlinearity increase monotonically with @xmath20 .",
    "the wigner function associated with @xmath55 can be written in terms of the suitably rescaled phase - space variables @xmath56 and @xmath57 as  @xcite @xmath58 which shows again the key role played by @xmath20 and , in turn , that the non - classicality measure based on the volume of the negative part of @xmath59 is determined by such parameter . in order to understand how @xmath7-nonclassicality and nonlinearity are related to each other ,",
    "we have studied both quantities against @xmath20 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mhodelta ] we report the resulting parametric plot , showing that @xmath60 monotonically increases with @xmath39 , thus supporting the idea that a growing degree of anharmonicity of the potential results in increased nonclassicality of the corresponding ground state .    -nonclassicality measure @xmath61 versus the degree of nonlinearity for the mho potential and for @xmath62 $ ] . ]    however , the picture changes significantly as soon as we consider p - nonclassicality quantified by the entanglement potential which , as said , can single out more detailed features of quantumness .",
    "indeed , at variance with what has been found above , such figure of merit turns out to depend on @xmath43 and @xmath44 independently .",
    "the reason for such a difference in behavior should be ascribed to the fact that entanglement at the output of a beam splitter can be originated either by a non - gaussian input state or by gaussian single - mode squeezing . in other words ,",
    "nonlinearity is needed to generate w - nonclassicality , while p - nonclassicality may be obtained using just squeezing .    in order to illustrate this clearly , in fig .",
