    "field theories on fuzzy spheres are being actively pursued in the past few years @xcite .",
    "the primary interest in studying fuzzy spaces stems from the attractive discretization it offers to regularize quantum field theories preserving symmetries .",
    "it is known that a lattice discretization though helpful in regularizing the field theory breaks the symmetries of the theory under consideration and the full symmetry is realized only when the regulator is taken to zero .",
    "this problem does not occur in the fuzzy case . in the process",
    "the fermion doubling problem is also avoided @xcite .",
    "also the possibility of new phases in the continuum theory which breaks translation as well as other global symmetries can be studied through simulations @xcite .",
    "furthermore one can incorporate supersymmetry in a precise manner .",
    "all these issues and many more attractive features can be found discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "fuzzy spheres and their generalizations were also considered in a kaluza klein framework as extra dimensional space .",
    "there is also a proposal for dynamically generating such spaces in the same framework @xcite . also analytically and through simulations one can study evolution of geometries and their transitions .",
    "such spaces also arise as backgrounds in string theory with appropriate chern - simons coupling @xcite .",
    "our considerations here will be applicable in those scenarios too .    in the present work we go beyond the usual lie algebra characterizing the fuzzy sphere = x^l ,  _",
    "i x_i^2  =  ^2 .",
    "what we have in mind is the study of various aspects of a surface whose coordinates satisfy the cubic algebra , also known as the higgs algebra ( ha ) = c_1 z + c_2 z^3 ,  [ x _ ,  z ]  =  x_. this algebra originally arose as a symmetry algebra in the study of the  kepler problem \" in curved spaces , particularly on a sphere @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanical hamiltonian of a particle in a kepler potential on the surface of a sphere has a dynamical symmetry given by the above algebra and can be used to solve the problem exactly .",
    "the ha can be studied as a deformation of @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "it can also be considered as a deformation of @xmath3 @xcite . in this sense",
    "the ha sits between the lie and @xmath4 deformed algebras .",
    "such algebras are interesting not only from the physical point of view but are also widely studied in mathematics @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we derive the higgs algebra by quantizing the poisson structure on a manifold , which is embedded in @xmath0 .",
    "we call this manifold , the higgs manifold , @xmath5 , as the algebra got from the poisson algebra is the higgs algebra .",
    "arlind et .",
    "@xcite also produced new nonlinear deformations of the @xmath1 algebra of different kinds which gave them torus geometry as well as topology change .",
    "another algebra that exhibits topology change is the sklyanin algebra @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows ; sec .",
    "ii shows the derivation of the higgs algebra from the poisson algebra on the higgs manifold . the question of topology change in surfaces that are not round spheres is also presented . in this process of topology change",
    ", we encounter the singularity which is discussed in detail . in sec .",
    "iii , we briefly introduce the interesting aspects of the ha and focus on its finite dimensional representations .",
    "iv gives the construction of the coherent states ( cs ) of the ha in detail .",
    "herein , we also provide the measure required for the resolution of unity .",
    "these cs are then used in sec .",
    "v to obtain the star product .",
    "our conclusions and outlook are presented in sec .",
    "we consider the following embedding in @xmath0 , [ surface ] x^2 + y^2 + ( z^2  -   ) ^2 = 1 .",
    "this is the surface we call as the higgs manifold , @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 is a parameter which can be varied .",
    "we now analyze this equation for different values of @xmath6 .    for @xmath7 , it is easy to see that there is a singular point @xmath8 where the surface degenerates .",
    "but in the discrete case , the representations do not display any difficulty at this value .",
    "when @xmath9 there are no solutions .",
    "for @xmath10 we have a deformed sphere , but still symmetric under rotations about the z - axis .",
    "the surface becomes two disconnected spheres for @xmath11 .",
    "these are explicitly shown in the figures below for specific values of @xmath6 .    *",
    "the singularity *    we use cylindrical coordinates to show the conical singularity arising at @xmath12 and @xmath13 as shown in fig .",
    "the equation of the surface becomes .this acts as a constraint giving @xmath14 in terms of @xmath15 . substituting this in the line element of euclidean @xmath16-space , in cylindrical coordinates , @xmath17 ,",
    "we get the induced metric on this surface .",
    "ds^2=dr^2+r^2d^2 . as @xmath18 , the first term of the metric approaches @xmath19 .",
    "this implies a scaling of @xmath15 by @xmath20 .",
    "this in turn induces a scaling of @xmath21 by @xmath22 .",
    "thus the new @xmath21 coordinate has range from @xmath23 to @xmath24 , making the origin a conical singularity .",
    "this singularity can not be removed by a coordinate transformation .    * the poisson algebra on @xmath5",
    "*    we use the poisson structure on @xmath0 as defined by @xcite , to derive the higgs algebra .",
    "this poisson bracket is given by \\{f  g } = where , @xmath25 and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are two functions on @xmath0 .",
    "using this we find the following : \\{x  y}=4z^3 - 4z , \\{z  x}=2y , \\{y  z}=2x .",
    "this , when quantized gives the higgs algebra .",
    "we have shown in the previous section as to how the cubic poisson bracket can be induced by a surface that is quartic in @xmath14 . when we quantize this non - linear bracket we get the ha .",
    "the interest in studying these nonlinear algebras , apart from the physical applications @xcite , is that we can construct unitary finite or infinite dimensional representations .",
    "these and other interesting aspects were studied for many of these nonlinear structures , collectively called the polynomial algebras , by various authors @xcite . in what follows we will explicitly state the representations of importance to us .",
    "let @xmath28 be the generators of a three dimensional polynomial algebra .",
    "this algebra is defined by the following commutation relations : = c_1 z + c_2 z^3 f(z ) , = x_. in the above @xmath29 and @xmath30 are arbitrary constants .",
    "it is straight forward to check that the jacobi identity is preserved .",
    "when @xmath31 and @xmath32 or @xmath33 , we have the @xmath34 or @xmath35 algebra respectively .",
    "we will be interested in the cubic algbera that is treated as a deformation of the @xmath34 algebra .",
    "hence we will consider finite dimensional representations only .",
    "the finite dimensional irreducible representations of the ha are characterized , like in @xmath1 , by an integer or half integer @xmath36 of dimension @xmath37 . z j ,",
    "m & = & m j , m  , + x_+ j , m & = & j , m + 1  .",
    "the structure function @xmath38 is chosen such that @xmath39 .",
    "note that @xmath38 is defined only upto the addition of a constant .",
    "later we will see this freedom plays an importatnt role in arriving at the one parameter family of surfaces namely eq .",
    "( [ surface ] ) . for arbitrary polynomials",
    "@xmath40 , one can solve and find solutions for @xmath38 @xcite . the fact that the we can write @xmath40 as difference of structure functions @xmath38 enables one to find the casimir @xmath41 of the algebra in an almost trivial way . the casimir @xmath41 is : [ higgscas ] = , [ higgsrep ] j , m = g(j ) j , m where the curly brackets denote anti - commutator .",
    "it is easy to verify @xmath42~=~[\\mathcal{c},z]~=~0 $ ] .",
    "so far we have not specified what the explicit form of @xmath38 is and without further ado we state for our case of ha : [ commfunc ] g(z ) = c_0 + z ( z+1 ) + z^2 ( z+1)^2 .",
    "here @xmath43 is a constant . now",
    "the casimir as a function of @xmath44 alone assumes a form of a single or double well potential depending on the values of the parameters .",
    "the physical meaning of this behavior can be understood from the work of rocek @xcite .",
    "the condition for finite dimensional representations is also discussed in @xcite . in our case",
    "we note that @xmath45 , which is also the condition for the case of the @xmath1 algebra .",
    "this makes the function @xmath27 periodic and hence we can be sure that we have finite dimensional representations for the choice of parameters we will make for our higgs algebra .    applying eq .",
    "( [ commfunc ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ higgscas ] ) and then comparing it with eq .",
    "( [ surface ] ) , we get @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "let us note that though there is a singularity in the continuum limit , in the discrete case we have a valid representation theory as we vary the parameters .",
    "this looks like a novel resolution of singularity .",
    "similar behavior was noted in @xcite where , the topology changes from a sphere to a torus with a degenerate surface at a transition point in the parameter space .",
    "now we will construct the cs for this nonlinear algebra to get a better understanding of the semiclassical behavior .",
    "the field cs @xcite and their generalizations @xcite been extensively studied from various aspects , motivated mainly by applications to quantum optics .",
    "but , we are interested in them as providing appropriate semiclassical descriptions of the nonlinear algebra",
    ". as is well known there are two types of cs .",
    "( 1 ) those that are `` annihilation operator '' eigenstates also known as barut - girardello cs @xcite ( 2 ) states obtained through the action of the displacement operator also known as perelemov states @xcite .",
    "the first is useful when considering non compact groups like @xmath2 and the second for compact ones .",
    "we consider the finite dimensional representation of the higgs algebra as we want to view it as a deformation of the fuzzy sphere algebra .",
    "hence , we resort to the construction via the displacement operator .",
    "one should keep in mind that since our algebra is nonlinear one can not attach any group theoretical interpretation to such states .",
    "the actual procedure should be viewed as an algebraic construction and has been carried out in @xcite .    since , the algebra under study is not a lie algebra , a straightforward application of the perelomov prescription is also not possible , wherein essential use of the baker - campbell - hausdorff ( bch ) formula is made . to get around it",
    "we find a new operator @xmath49 such that @xmath50 = 2 \\ , z$ ] .",
    "let @xmath51 ; substituting this in the commutator relation we get [ su2su11 ] x_+ x_- g(,z ) - x_- x _",
    "+ g(,z+1 ) = 2 z  .",
    "choose the _ ansatz _ for @xmath52 of the form g(,z ) = , where @xmath53 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "now that we have the ` ladder ' operators that obey the @xmath34 algebra , we can use the perelomov prescription .",
    "the cs are given by = e^x_+ - ^ _ - j ,- j . disentangling the above exponential ,",
    "using the bch formula for @xmath34 and @xmath54 we find the expression for the cs acquires the form [ cshiggs ] = n^-1(||^2 ) e^x_+ j ,- j .",
    "where @xmath55 is the normalization constant that is yet to be determined and @xmath56 .",
    "notice that the ladder operators that form the ` lie algebra ' are not mutually adjoint .",
    "the above state is to be viewed as  non - linear @xmath34 coherent state \" and are very similar in spirit to the cs of nonlinear oscillators @xcite and extensively used in quantum optics .",
    "now we will study whether the above definition of cs is suitable .",
    "the requirements for @xmath57 to be cs have been enunciated by klauder @xcite : ( 1 ) @xmath58 should be normalizable , ( 2 ) @xmath57 should be continuous in @xmath59 , ( 3 ) @xmath57 should satisfy resolution of identity",
    ". we will consider normalization and resolution of identity in the following .      to find the normalization constant @xmath55",
    "we compute the scalar product of hacs and set it equal to @xmath60 .",

    "observe that the expression under the product is quadratic in @xmath62 and can be factorized .",

    "n=1 ^ 2j||^2n d_n , where a _ = - . taking the ratio of @xmath63 we get  =  .",
    "it can be seen that this is the condition for the generalized hypergeometric series for @xmath64 .",
    "hence , the final expression for the normalization constant of the ha is [ normconst ] n^2(||^2 ) = _ 3f_0(-a_+,-a_-,-2j;0;-||^2 ) .",
    "the resolution of identity is one very important criterion that any cs must satisfy : [ resid ] d(,| ) = .",
    "the integration is over the complex plane .",

    "n=0 ^ 2j dr x_+^n j , -j -j , j  x_-^n = . we know that the angular momentum states are complete and",
    "hence for the above equality to hold the integral should be equal to one . defining @xmath66 and simplifying the product as shown in the previous subsection we have [ residrad ] _ 0^",
    "dr  r^2n+1  ( r^2 ) = ( n+1 ) , where @xmath67 . making a change of variable , @xmath68 and replacing the discrete variable @xmath69 by the complex one @xmath70 we notice that the weight function @xmath71 and the r.h.s . of the above equation",
    "become a mellin transform related pair @xcite .",

    "this can be seen as a consequence of quantizing the higgs manifold using the hacs .",
    "the star product plays a ",
    "stellar \" role in the study of deformation quantization and noncommutative geometry .",
    "there exist in the literature a host of such products depending on various situations .",
    "for example the moyal product arises when one is dealing with a noncommutative plane and the underlying algebra happens to be the heisenberg - weyl type .",
    "similarly the kontsevich product arises when the noncommutative parameter itself , is a function of the coordinates .",
    "we in this section are interested in constructing a new product that will reduce to the star product of the fuzzy sphere when the parameter pertaining to the cubic term is set to zero .",
    "the technique for obtaining star product for the ha , follows grosse and presnajder @xcite and we refer to it for details regarding the use of cs in this construction .",
    "suffice it to mention here that cs ensures that the product obtained is associative .",
    "the algebra of functions on the higgs manifold , @xmath5 , is commutative under point - wise multiplication .",
    "when we quantize this manifold , this point - wise product is deformed to an associative star product which is noncommutative .",
    "we consider the algebra of operators , @xmath74 , generators of which satisfy the ha .",
    "these operators act on some hilbert space .",
    "we then use the symbol to map these operators to the functions on the higgs manifold .",
    "the symbol map is defined as follows : _ h  .",

    "the computations involve some non - trivial simplifications to bring it to eq .",
    "( [ hstar ] ) .",
    "we see that the first term in eq .",
    "( [ hstar ] ) is the point - wise product of the the two symbols and the term in the bracket gives the deformations .    as the star product was computed using the hacs we can be sure that they are well behaved at the conical singularity seen in the continuum .",
    "the reason is same as mentioned in section iii .",
    "in the present paper we have analyzed algebraic structures that are more general than the fuzzy sphere .",
    "we have shown that the interesting feature of the topology change studied in @xcite also occurs in the present case .",
    "it must be mentioned here that the ha arises naturally in the study of integrable dynamics of two dimensional curved surfaces .",
    "study of nonlinear deformations of algebra and their representation theory assumes importance in the context of noncommutative geometries .",
    "there have been attempts to write down the dirac operator for the @xmath3 algebra @xcite .",
    "such attempts can be extended to this nonlinear algebra too .",
    "quantum field theories on fuzzy spheres coming from @xmath1 representations can be further extended to our framework also .",
    "topology change will play an important role in such studies which will be explored in detail .",
    "fuzzy spheres are considered in the kaluza - klein framework and similar studies for higgs algebra will bring out new features .",
    "these novel surfaces can also be generated dynamically along the lines of fuzzy spheres and they will naturally arise when one introduces higher dimensional operators in the effective action of qft s .",
