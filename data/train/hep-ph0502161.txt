    "since the discovery of atmospheric neutrino oscillations @xcite , more recently that of solar neutrino oscillations @xcite , and still more recently confirmation of these two types of neutrino oscillations with accelerator- and reactor - produced neutrinos @xcite , many models have been proposed in the literature to explain the mass and mixing parameters associated with these oscillations @xcite .",
    "( we have cited just the most recent references for those experiments and several review articles for the models proposed . )",
    "some models restrict their scope to the lepton sector , while others such as grand unified models are more ambitious and attempt to explain the masses and mixings in both the lepton and quark sectors .",
    "the textures for the mass matrices obtained in the models may be simply postulated at the outset , derived from the observed mixing matrix with a diagonal charged lepton mass matrix , obtained from a certain unification group in conjunction with a well - defined family symmetry , or rely solely on the clebsch - gordon coefficients of that group .    until now",
    ", all viable models for the lepton sector have only had to explain the apparent near maximal @xmath12 mixing angle for the atmospheric neutrinos and the less than maximal @xmath13 large mixing angle ( lma ) solution for the solar neutrinos , while satisfying the two observed mass squared differences , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and the upper bound for the still unobserved @xmath16 mixing angle . on the other hand , the neutrino mass hierarchy ( normal or inverted ) , the majorana vs dirac nature of the neutrinos , the appropriate values for @xmath16 and the cp - violating phases ( one dirac and two majorana ) remain undetermined experimentally .    with the next more precise round of neutrino oscillation experiments which will restrict some of the unknowns , many of the more quantitative models proposed",
    "are not expected to survive the more stringent tests of their predictions . in particular , determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy will eliminate models based on an approximately conserved @xmath17 lepton number @xcite if the hierarchy is observed to be normal , while the conventional type i seesaw models will be strongly disfavored if the hierarchy is observed to be inverted @xcite . moreover , small as opposed to very small predictions for @xmath16 pose a critical test for many models .",
    "it is thus of utmost importance to sharpen the predictions for each model , so that the list of presently viable models can be winnowed down as much as possible when the new data is obtained .",
    "one particularly interesting class of models is that based on the @xmath0 grand unification group .",
    "there are two kinds of minimal models in this class : those based on higgs representations with dimensions @xmath18 , and possibly also @xmath19 and/or @xmath20 @xcite ; and those based on @xmath21 , and @xmath22 representations @xcite .",
    "the former type generally has symmetric and/or antisymmetric matrix elements , while the latter type generally involve lopsided matrices for the down quarks and charged leptons .",
    "the matrix textures are derived either from the clebsch - gordon coefficients required or from some abelian or non - abelian family symmetry .",
    "these two types of @xmath0 models tend to predict @xmath16 angles either near the present upper chooz bound of @xmath23 , or in the @xmath24 range , respectively .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to sharpen the allowed values for the mixing parameters of the lopsided @xmath0 model proposed some time ago by babu , barr , and the author @xcite .",
    "upon further refinement by the latter two authors @xcite , the model has become very predictive with all four quark mixing parameters and nine quark and charged lepton masses determined by just eight of the twelve model input parameters .",
    "the four remaining input parameters characterize the right - handed majorana mass matrix with three of them complex in general . in most of the previous papers based on this model",
    ", the authors took the latter parameters to be real and adjusted them to give good fits to the then known neutrino mass and mixing data . here",
    "we allow all three to be complex and obtain scatter plots of the predicted neutrino mixing parameters . in so doing , we obtain some bounds on @xmath16 and @xmath12 which , if violated , will rule out the model which has been highly successful todate . by introducing two very small additional parameters in the dirac neutrino mass matrix ,",
    "we find that the observed baryon asymmetry can be obtained through resonant leptogenesis in the model . in order to obtain the latter predictions ,",
    "the bounds obtained on the neutrino mixing parameters and cp phase are even more tightly constrained .",
    "with maximal cp violation in the majorana mass matrix and two of the three parameters equal , the mixing angles and phase become highly correlated with each other and the baryon asymmetry generated in the model .    in sec .",
    "ii we briefly review some of the model details and present the results of the parameter searches in sec .",
    "a summary of the constraints found in the model is presented in sec .",
    "iv , where we also briefly comment on the predictions of the model found by jankowski and marbury @xcite for the @xmath25 lepton flavor - changing branching ratio .",
    "their prediction is also crucial for the viability of the model and has a chance of being tested by the meg collaboration @xcite even before the values of the mixing angles are further restricted by new reactor and/or long baseline experiments .",
    "the @xmath0 grand unified model as initially proposed by babu , barr and the author @xcite , and later updated by barr and the author to apply to the large mixing angle ( lma ) neutrino oscillation solution has already been described in great detail in the literature @xcite .",
    "here we just summarize the salient features and refer the reader to those references for more information .",
    "the model is based on the minimum set of higgs fields which solves the doublet - triplet splitting problem as proposed by barr and raby @xcite .",
    "this requires just one @xmath26 whose vacuum expectation value ( vev ) points in the @xmath27 direction , two pairs of @xmath28 s which stabilize the solution , along with several higgs fields in the @xmath29 representations and higgs singlets .",
    "the higgs superpotential exhibits the @xmath30 symmetry which is used for the flavor symmetry of the grand unified model .",
    "the combination of vevs , @xmath31 and @xmath32 break @xmath0 to the standard model , where the latter two vevs point in the @xmath33 singlet direction .",
    "the electroweak vevs arise from doublets in the @xmath34 and @xmath35 representations of @xmath33 in the combinations @xmath36          \\langle h_d \\rangle & = & \\langle \\overline{5 } ( { \\bf 10}_h)\\rangle            \\cos \\gamma + \\langle \\overline{5}({\\bf",
    "16}'_h)\\rangle \\sin \\gamma,\\\\ \\end{array } \\label{eq : higgsmixings}\\ ] ] while the mixing orthogonal to @xmath37 gets massive at the grand unified theory ( gut ) scale .",
    "matter superfields appear in three chiral @xmath38 s , two pairs of vectorlike @xmath38 and @xmath39 , two @xmath40 s and several @xmath41 s .",
    "the mass matrices follow from froggatt - nielsen diagrams @xcite in which the superheavy fields are integrated out , with the flavor symmetry allowing only certain particular contributions to their mass matrix elements .",
    "the dirac mass matrices for the up quarks , down quarks , neutrinos and charged leptons are found to be @xmath42 m_n = \\left(\\matrix { \\eta & \\delta_n & \\delta'_n \\cr \\delta_n & 0 &",

    "\\end{array } \\label{eq : dmatrices}\\ ] ] in the convention where the left - handed fields label the rows and the left - handed conjugate fields label the columns .",
    "the entries in the first row and first column are the most uncertain , especially for the up quark and dirac neutrino mass matrices , for they arise from higher order terms involving several integrations out of the massive neutrino lines . as originally proposed , the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 were absent . in a later application of the model to leptogenesis @xcite",
    ", we have observed that the baryon asymmetry lies closer to the preferred value of @xmath45 @xcite , if we allow @xmath43 and @xmath44 to take on nonzero values in the dirac neutrino matrix @xmath46 , which are small enough in @xmath47 , however , so as not to upset the good results in the quark sector .",
    "we shall consider both possibilities for these two parameters in the searches to be presented .",
    "the lopsided nature of the down quark and charged lepton mass matrices arises from the dominance of the @xmath48 @xmath49 contribution to the electroweak symmetry breaking over that of the @xmath29 .",
    "the pronounced lopsidedness with @xmath50 readily explains the small @xmath51 quark mixing and near maximal @xmath52 atmospheric neutrino mixing for any reasonable right - handed majorana neutrino mass matrix , @xmath53 .",
    "all nine quark and charged lepton masses , plus the three ckm angles and cp phase , are well - fitted with the original eight input parameters defined at the gut scale to fit the low scale observables after evolution downward from @xmath54 gev @xcite : @xmath55 the effective light neutrino mass matrix , @xmath56 , is obtained from the conventional type  i seesaw mechanism @xcite once the right - handed majorana mass matrix , @xmath53 , is specified .",
    "while the large atmospheric neutrino mixing @xmath57 arises primarily from the structure of the charged lepton mass matrix @xmath58 , the structure of the right - handed majorana mass matrix @xmath53 determines the type of @xmath59 solar neutrino mixing , so that the solar and atmospheric mixings appear to be essentially decoupled in the model .",
    "the lma solar neutrino solution is obtained with a special form of @xmath53 @xcite , which can be explained by the structure of the froggatt - nielsen diagrams : @xmath60 where the parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 are those introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dmatrices ] ) for the dirac sector .",
    "the vanishing @xmath63 subdeterminant of @xmath53 arises naturally if the yukawa couplings are universal at the gut scale .",
    "the new parameters @xmath64 and @xmath65 are undetermined but expected to be of @xmath66 , since the first row and first column of @xmath53 have been properly scaled by powers of the very small @xmath62 parameter . as such",
    ", the right - handed majorana mass matrix exhibits a very strong hierarchy .",

    "\\end{array } \\label{eq : mnui}\\ ] ] note that the very strong hierarchy in @xmath53 can nearly balance the large hierarchy in @xmath46 to yield a rather mild mass hierarchy for the @xmath56 light neutrino mass matrix .",
    "in fact , if @xmath69 were to hold , which has a texture similar to that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mr ] ) , the seesaw formula would yield a light neutrino mass matrix exactly proportional to the identity matrix resulting in a three - fold mass degeneracy .",
    "the author has argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that a normal hierarchy solution is much more stable than an inverted hierarchy solution for such type i seesaw models , and our results apply for this kind of solution .",
    "barr has recently proposed more general possibilities which result in such a mild neutrino mass hierarchy @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath70 can be chosen real and to a large degree sets the scale for the atmospheric neutrino mixing mass squared difference . in most previous studies of the model , aside from that of leptogenesis , we chose the remaining three parameters , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , to be real .",
    "in order to determine the range of predictions for the neutrino mixing angles , we now allow all three of them to be complex .",
    "in order to carry out the search of the parameter space for a stable normal hierarchy solution , we shall require that the oscillation parameters determined by the model lie in the following presently allowed ranges at the 90% confidence level @xcite-@xcite , @xcite : @xmath71      \\delta m^2_{21 } & = ( 7.4 - 8.5 ) \\times 10^{-5}\\ { \\rm ev^2 } , &                  \\quad \\tan^2 \\theta_{12 } & = 0.33 - 0.50,\\\\[0.1 in ]      \\delta m^2_{31 } & \\simeq \\delta m^2_{32 } , & \\quad \\sin^2 2\\theta_{13 }           & \\leq 0.16.\\\\ \\label{eq : nudata } \\end{array}\\ ] ] the allowed variation in @xmath11 corresponds to the present bound of @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "we find that the following bounds for the magnitudes of the input parameters in @xmath53 cover the above experimentally allowed ranges : @xmath73 where we have set @xmath74 gev as explained below .",
    "we then use monte carlo techniques to throw points in the complex @xmath64 and @xmath65 planes which uniformly cover the disks whose radii are indicated above .",
    "it should be noted that in this paper , we shall neglect any running of the neutrino mass and mixing parameters from the gut scale down to the low scales .",
    "this has become more or less standard procedure in the literature and is less susceptible to corrections when @xmath75 is low , the neutrino mass hierarchy is normal , and the two low - lying neutrino mass eigenstates have nearly opposite @xmath76-parities @xcite .",
    "all three conditions hold in the model under consideration .",
    "in fact , we can use the convenient add - on program package for mathematica called `` reap '' provided by antusch et al .",

    "we assume that the vevs , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , are held constant while @xmath84 and @xmath96 evolve from the gut scale to the weak scale according to the renormalization group equations .    by inserting this information into the reap package of antusch et al .",
    "@xcite , we can obtain the evolved results for the neutrino mixing parameters .",
    "we find for various test cases that the evolved mixing angles and phases are changed by less than @xmath100 from their gut scale values , while the light neutrino masses are reduced by @xmath101 .",

    "of particular interest is whether @xmath12 lies below @xmath116 or above @xmath116 , if the mixing is not exactly maximal . with a normal mass hierarchy as suggested by our model , the former signifies that the highest neutrino mass eigenstate corresponds more to a @xmath117 flavor composition rather than to a @xmath118 composition , while the opposite is true for the latter possibility . in figs .",
    "1(c)-(f ) we also present results for ( c ) @xmath119 , ( d ) @xmath120 , ( e ) @xmath121 , and ( f ) the baryon asymmetry , @xmath9 , vs. @xmath11 .",

    "interestingly enough , the present best fits for @xmath120 are 0.006 and 0.004 from three - neutrino mixing analyses with all oscillation data considered @xcite .",
    "the model seems to be rather insensitive to the leptonic cp - violating phase @xmath121 in this more general search of the complex values for @xmath64 and @xmath65 , for the full range from @xmath124 to @xmath125 is essentially uniformly populated in fig .",
    "finally we note that values for the baryon asymmetry in fig .",

    "2 , the corresponding scatter plots are presented for the choice @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "this latter choice has been made as a result of a protracted search , so as to maximize the calculated baryon asymmetry as we shall see , without spoiling the results in the quark sector . in the previous study reported in the last paper of reference @xcite , the corresponding values taken were @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",

    "5(d ) is associated with the choices of positive or negative imaginary values for @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "clearly the imposition of these restrictions for the @xmath187 parameter set has greatly enhanced the probability that the baryon asymmetry will lie in or near to its observed value .",
    "this makes for a rather compelling scenario within the model .",
    "the question arises as to how likely is it that such restricted values should apply for the majorana mass parameters .",
    "it is easy to see from the froggatt - nielsen diagrams for the majorana mass matrix that if only one higgs vev is responsible for breaking lepton number , by the @xmath188 family symmetry of the model only one diagram will contribute to each matrix element , the structure of @xmath53 will be purely geometrical and its determinant will vanish , cf .",
    "ref . @xcite . with @xmath189",
    ", only one diagram contributes to each of the 11 , 13 , and 31 matrix elements , while two or more diagrams will be required for the 12 and 21 elements .",
    "this is the simplest possibility for a nonvanishing determinant , as required for the seesaw mechanism .",
    "the fact that all three parameters are purely imaginary makes for a maximum cp violation in the right - handed majorana mass matrix as all other parameters are real .    to understand the apparent difficulty in reaching values in the observed range of @xmath45 , we note the following .",
    "the scenario of resonant leptogenesis @xcite arises naturally in the model , for the two heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos have nearly equal masses and nearly opposite cp - parity .",
    "however , one must impose the condition that the mass difference of these two heavy majorana states be at least as large as the half - width of either state for the resonance formula to make sense .",
    "this forced us to raise the magnitudes of @xmath136 and @xmath44 in the dirac neutrino mass matrix . for smaller values of these parameters",
    "than those chosen in the relevant figures , fewer points reach the @xmath190 range of @xmath9 , as the range of @xmath11 is shifted lower with more points occuring below 0.50 than above 0.50 .",
    "it is interesting that in going from the set of matrices with the original choice of @xmath136 and @xmath44 in fig . 1 to the new choice of values in figs . 2 - 5 , the @xmath191 mixing parameter in the quark mixing matrix",
    "is raised from 0.2220 to 0.2240 , in better keeping with the new observed value which is preferred for unitarity reasons . the one negative effect in making this change",
    "is that the up quark mass is raised from 3.5 mev to 5.5 mev after evolution from the gut scale , which is above the preferred range .",
    "while the condition for thermal resonant leptogenesis is easily satisfied for such right - handed majorana masses as in the example given above , the overproduction of gravitinos in the early universe is a problem in the supergravity scenario of susy breaking ; this can be alleviated if the susy breaking occurs via the gauge - mediated scenario @xcite . as illustrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , this problem can be completely avoided and satisfactory leptogenesis and baryon asymmetry obtained , if the model is expanded to include three additional intermediate mass scale singlets which lead to a double seesaw mechanism . however , with this expanded seesaw mechanism many more parameters are introduced , and the model becomes much less predictive .",
    "from the above results we can conclude that the model with a normal mass hierarchy can easily fit the presently observed neutrino mixing data .",
    "as originally proposed , eight of the twelve model parameters have been fixed by the quark and lepton masses and quark mixing data , while the remaining four ( three complex and one real ) parameters of the right - handed majorana mass matrix are varied .",
    "the real @xmath70 parameter centers the @xmath14 model spectrum on the observed @xmath192 confidence level interval given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nudata ] ) . for the best fit point of @xmath193 ,",
    "the predicted atmospheric neutrino mixing angle is nearly maximal , corresponding to @xmath194 in agreement with the observed best fit value of 1.00 .",
    "no such preference for a particular value of @xmath119 in the allowed range is found .",
    "the predicted values for @xmath120 are of special interest .",
    "there we found a range of @xmath195 which lies noticeably lower than that predicted by most other models where values very close to the upper bound of 0.04 are more generally expected @xcite .",
    "this is true not only for the nearly conserved @xmath17 models , but also for the @xmath0 models with symmetric @xmath196 and @xmath197 higgs representations .",
    "the lower values predicted in our model have relevance for the future study of neutrino oscillations with reactor beams .",
    "if @xmath198 disappearance is observed very close to the present chooz bound by the next generation reactor experiments , the @xmath0 model under consideration will be ruled out . on the other hand ,",
    "it is interesting to note that if future reactor experiments do not see some @xmath198 disappearance , the model predicts it will certainly be seen with superbeam and/or neutrino factory experiments .",
    "while there remains much interest in determining the dirac phase @xmath121 for @xmath76 violation , it is rather surprising that the model is able to accommodate almost any value .    with the original dirac neutrino mass parameters , the resonance leptogenesis inherent in the model generated a baryon asymmetry which falls more than two orders of magnitude short of the observed value . in an effort to increase the effect ,",
    "the original very small @xmath62 parameter was adjusted and two new equally small parameters , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , were added to the dirac neutrino mass matrix . this helped to recover two missing orders of magnitude for @xmath9 , provided the three complex parameters in the right - handed majorana mass matrix were chosen very near to or on their imaginary axes . by selecting only those points which satisfied the observed neutrino mixing results and",
    "for which @xmath199 , we observed that the mixing angles lie along very narrow bands .",
    "these bands were further dramatically tightened by choosing not only @xmath64 and @xmath65 purely imaginary , but restricting @xmath65 to be equal to @xmath144 .",
    "for this situation a limited range of @xmath153 was found over which @xmath119 falls from 0.50 to 0.38 , @xmath200 varies from 0.0031 to 0.0020 , and the dirac cp phase varies from @xmath201 . on the other hand , a narrow band also developed for the baryon asymmetry due to the strong mixing angle and cp phase correlations , as it rises from @xmath202 with increasing @xmath11 .",
    "the appearance of such narrow bands is directly related to the very narrow acceptable range for @xmath145 , while the ratio @xmath185 varies along the length of each band .",
    "we argued that the @xmath150 restriction can be understood in terms of one froggatt - nielsen diagram for each of the 11 , 13 , and 31 matrix elements of @xmath53 , while two such diagrams can contribute to the 12 and 21 elements .",
    "all these results are of considerable interest and will severely test the model in the future .",
    "since the light neutrino mass spectrum has a normal hierarchy , the model predicts no neutrinoless double beta decay should be observed in the near future .",
    "in fact , for all choices of the model parameters which lead to acceptable ranges for the mixing parameters of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nudata ] ) , we find the effective mass is @xmath203 @xcite , three orders of magnitude below the present bound @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "we address briefly the issue of lepton flavor violation in the decay process @xmath25 .",
    "jankowski and maybury @xcite have studied this particular class of @xmath0 models with lopsided charged lepton mass matrices in order to determine the expected branching ratio for the above decay , under the assumption that the supersymmetric grand unified model breaks directly to the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model . given the combined constraints on the cmssm parameters from direct searches and from the wmap satellite observations",
    "@xcite , they find that for a low value of @xmath50 preferred by the model , the branching ratio should be of @xmath204(@xmath205 ) and very close to the present upper limit of @xmath206 @xcite . hence the @xmath207 decay should be observed in the new meg experiment @xcite which is expected to start taking data in 2006 .",
    "this prediction is based on the slepton masses being in the 125 - 150 gev range , while the neutralino masses are around 300 - 500 gev .",
    "these ranges are also favored in cmssm models by the recent study of the best chi - squared fits to all the data with @xmath208 by ellis et al .",
    "on the other hand , minimal @xmath0 models leading to symmetric or antisymmetric mass matrix elements favor a smaller lepton - violating branching ratio of @xmath204(@xmath209 ) or less @xcite .",
    "the coming meg experiment which is expected to be sensitive down to the @xmath210 branching ratio level may thus be able to rule out one of the two classes of minimal @xmath0 models before the new reactor experiments can be launched .",
