    "a number of giant luminous arcs ( glas ) have now been detected in many distant clusters of galaxies ( e.g.  soucail et al .",
    "@xcite ; lynds & petrosian @xcite ; fort & mellier @xcite for a review ) .",
    "their spectroscopic confirmations as lensed normal distant galaxies ( e.g.  soucail et al .",
    "@xcite ) lead to exciting new cosmological developments in this decade .    probing",
    "the mass distribution of distant clusters is one of avenues of these developments ( e.g.   narayan & bartelmann @xcite ; hattori et al .",
    "@xcite ; umetsu et al .",
    "early analyses pointed out discrepancy of a factor 2  3 between cluster masses derived from strong lensing and standard x - ray analysis of the icm ( e.g.  loeb & mao @xcite ; miralda - escud & babul @xcite ) .",
    "several possible solutions are proposed : ( i ) loeb & mao @xcite proposed that non - thermal pressure due to equipartition magnetic field and turbulent may play an important role on supporting the icm .",
    "( ii ) a multi - phase model of the icm in the central part of clusters  indicated by the cooling flow model ( allen et al .",
    "@xcite )  increases by a factor 23 the mass deduced from x - ray compared to standard ( single - phase ) isothermal model ( allen @xcite ) . ( iii )",
    "leaving from \" inappropriate modeling of the cluster mass distribution due to neglecting the contributions by substructure and member galaxies , which leads overestimation of the cluster mass from strong lensing events ( e.g.  kneib et al .",

    "one can expect that the next generation x - ray telescopes ( chandra , xmm , astro - e ) will provide definite answer of the first two possible solutions .",
    "the third one seems , however , the closest one to the reality ( hattori et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    instead of these detailed analyses for individual clusters , statistics of glas constrains the average properties of cluster mass distribution .",
    "the statistics of glas is consist in counting the number of glas in a well defined cluster sample and constrains the average properties of cluster mass distribution . using spherically symmetric mass distribution models ,",
    "wu & hammer ( @xcite ) showed that the predicted number of glas was critically dependent on the degree of the central mass concentration of clusters .",
    "miralda - escud ( @xcite ) examined arc statistics with elliptical lens models and concluded that elliptical mass distribution did not change the above conclusion drastically .",
    "using numerically simulated model for clusters , bartelmann and his collaborators ( bartelmann & weiss @xcite ; bartelmann et al .",
    "@xcite , henceforth bsw95 ) showed that their asymmetric cluster mass distribution ( e.g.  substructure ) increased the expected number of glas . in a further study ,",
    "bartelmann et al .  ( @xcite ) examined the dependence of arc statistics on cosmological parameters .",
    "they concluded that the open cold dark matter model gave the largest number of giant arcs compared to other cosmology , in particular the einstein - de sitter universe and that the open cold dark matter model was likely to be the only model which could match current observations .",
    "the first well - defined gla survey was conducted by le fvre et al ( @xcite , henceforth lf94 ) .",
    "hattori et al .",
    "( @xcite , henceforth paper i ) proposed a method that predicted the number of glas taking into account both detection conditions in the arc survey and the evolution of source galaxies .",
    "they applied their method to the lf94 arc survey sample using the _ einstein _ x - ray data to calibrate the mass distribution - assuming the hydrostatic equilibrium and the spherical symmetry .",
    "the conclusion of paper i is that the expected number of glas deduced from the x - ray analysis was inconsistent with the observed one .",
    "hamana & futamase ( @xcite , henceforth hf97 ) examined the gla statistics taking into account the evolution of the luminosity function found by the canada france redshift survey ( lilly et al .",
    "they showed that the observed evolution in the galaxy luminosity function increased the expected gla number by a factor of 2  3 at most .",
    "although the @xmath2 relation adopted by them and by wu & hammer ( @xcite ) appeared to be incorrect when compared with recent results ( e.g.  mushotzky & scharf @xcite ; markevitch @xcite ) , we can study how sensitive the gla statistics is on the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "this paper is the second in a series on the giant luminous arc statistics with the lf94 arc survey sample .",
    "in this paper we re - visit the lf94 sample with higher quality _ rosat hri _",
    "data because no precise measurements of the icm spatial distribution in the lf94 sample clusters were available in paper i. we assume that the mass distribution in clusters are spherically symmetric .",

    "miralda - escud ( @xcite ) and paper i showed that the number of glas responds sensitively on the intrinsic size of galaxies and the number of glas decreases drastically when the intrinsic size of galaxies becomes smaller than the seeing fwhm .",
    "( see fig .  3 in miralda - escud @xcite or fig .  4 in paper i )",
    "we believe that this effect is stronger than that of surface brightness evolution because spirals seems not showing strong evolution in luminosity .",
    "+ if the galaxy evolution history is drawn with the merger model which is currently popular ( e.g.  kauffmann @xcite ; bekki @xcite ; bekki & shioya @xcite ; noguchi @xcite ) , the galaxy evolution model we employed should be largely modified .",
    "owing to merging - induced star formation , the merger model predicts the existence of temporarily very bright galaxies at various redshifts . since the current galaxies are to be formed by aggregation of smaller building blocks in the merger model , the number density of source galaxies at high redshift is larger than the current galaxy number density .",
    "these two effects may thus increase the number of glas .",
    "although the precise modeling of the merger history is required to quantify the effect , we can regard that these effects are included as re - normalization in the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "the result obtained by hf97 thus provided a rough idea how this effect changes model prediction . on the other hand ,",
    "as we discussed above , smaller size of the block - building galaxies at high redshift leads drastic decrease of the number of glas .",
    "becoming larger in size by merging is competed by becoming less in number of galaxies by merging . on the arc statistics , the effect of being smaller intrinsically seems stronger than both being more luminous intrinsically and being numerous at high redshift .",
    "+ asada ( @xcite ) showed that the use of the deyer - roeder distance to take into account the inhomogeneity of matter distribution in the universe decreased the cross - section for forming glas for all the sets of ( @xmath573 ) .",
    "therefore the appropriate application of angular diameter distance taking account of the inhomogeneity of the universe further decrease the number of glas .",
    "+ our calculation assumed that one gla is generated from one single source galaxy .",
    "however , it may happen that two or more glas are generated from a single source galaxy .",
    "this means that the _",
    "` true ' _ expected numbers of glas exists between one times the expected numbers we calculated and two times of them under the spherically symmetric mass distribution models .",
    "+ we close our discussion by this simple question : are _ all _ observed glas in lf94 s sample _ really _ giant luminous arcs ?",
    "lf94 discussed the possibility of mis - identification by elongated objects and claimed that 6 glas they found were really glas either because their widths were not spatially resolved , or because they presented a well - defined curvature .",
    "however , the giant luminous arcs in and are located 67 and 47 arcsec away from cluster center respectively , which are unusually large values that would make the cluster extremely massive .",
    "although , such mis - identification does not affect our result , it would seriously affect the gla statistics which use the number of gla on the whole sky extrapolating the gla detecting rate in emss sample .",
    "spectroscopic conformation of glas therefore is needed for all the glas in the sample .",
    "we studied the statistics of glas with spherically symmetric lens models based on our original x - ray spatial data of all the 15 clusters in the lf94 s arc survey sample , obtained by _",
    "rosat hri_. we re - investigated whether the observed number of glas in the lf94 s cluster sample could be reproduced with the cluster mass distribution models consistent with the x - ray data of spatial distribution of the icm within a frame work of spherical symmetry assuming isothermality and the hydrodynamical equilibrium .",
    "we employed two types of cluster mass distribution models .",
    "one is a model comes from the conventional @xmath0 model used for x - ray spatial data fittings ( the isothermal @xmath574 model in this paper ) .",
    "the other is the universal dark matter halo profile model proposed by nfw ( the enf98-nfw model and the mss98-nfw model in this paper ) .",
    "the enf98-nfw model is a model with the result of cosmological and hydrodynamical simulations to examine the evolution of x - ray emitting hot gas in clusters , by enf98 .",
    "the mss98-nfw model is a model with the result of the theoretical work by mss98 .",
    "models consistent with current best data of spatial distribution of the icm in the sample clusters taken by _",
    "rosat hri _",
    "( isothermal @xmath574 model and mss98-nfw model ) gave the numbers of glas less than two orders of magnitude and this fewness is significant comparing to the uncertainties in the background galaxy model we employed .",
    "on the other hand , enf98-nfw model almost reproduced the observed number of glas .",
    "some clusters virial temperatures of this model , however , are much higher than the temperatures measured by _ asca _ or evaluated from the @xmath1 relation of ae98 .",
    "this indicates that either : non - thermal components of the pressure play a significant role in supporting the icm ( e.g. loeb & mao @xcite ) or the mass distribution of sample clusters deviates significantly from the spherical symmetry .",
    "for example , ms1006.0@xmath581202 has straight arcs which can not be formed by spherically symmetric mass distribution .",
    "some sample clusters show significant irregularity in their x - ray morphologies .",
    "we believe that taking into account the irregularity in mass distribution of clusters is therefore very important subject and will constitute the next step together with a better handling of the temperature measurement of the icm .",
