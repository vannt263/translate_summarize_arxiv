    "ngc 4449 is a magellanic - type irregular star - forming galaxy , first studied at x - ray wavelengths with the _ einstein _ satellite @xcite .",
    "the _ einstein _",
    "ipc and hri observations detected three point sources in the galaxy and one of them coincides with an extremely luminous supernova remnant ( snr ) , previously identified with radio observations @xcite .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "hri observations resolved seven luminous x - ray sources in the @xmath2 region of ngc 4449 and identified an extended emission feature , which is mainly from the unresolved point sources and hot interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "chandra _ observation ( conducted in 2001 ) has detected 24 x - ray point sources in the optical extend of ngc 4449 and the x - ray point source population has been determined to be dominated by x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) along with supersoft x - ray sources ( ssss ) and snrs @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the x - ray emission from the magellanic - type galaxies dominantly comes from young population objects and the x - ray sources are spatially associated with the star forming regions ( e.g , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the case of ngc 4449 appears to be consistent with this feature , as the bright xrbs are associated with young star clusters @xcite .",
    "the transient x - ray source population has been identified in magellanic - type galaxies such as the small and large magellanic clouds ( smc and lmc ) and ngc 55 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the majority of the transient sources are xrbs , including low - mass and high - mass xrbs .",
    "in addition , another important class are ssss , which contribute approximately @xmath3 of the total transient population and are the inevitable class of objects in these galaxies .",
    "ssss are soft x - ray emitting objects , with spectra resembling a blackbody in a temperature range of 20  100 ev and x - ray luminosities being in a range of @xmath4 .",
    "ssss were first discovered with _",
    "observatory @xcite , and _ rosat _ later discovered more of them in magellanic clouds ( mcs ) and in our galaxy @xcite , establishing them as an important new class of x - ray objects .",
    "supported by many observational studies , the steady thermonuclear burning of accreted matter on the surface of a white dwarf ( wd ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is the most accepted explanation for ssss . in addition , sss emission has also been observed in many nova systems ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . for these cases",
    ", a fraction of the hot envelope , most of which has been ejected during a nova explosion , still remains on the surface of a wd @xcite and powers sss emission .",
    "typical ssss have little emission above 1 kev , while a companion class of ssss has been identified in the external galaxies that have x - ray emission above 1 kev .",
    "the latter systems are referred as quasi - soft sources ( qsss ) with temperature in a range of @xmath5 ev @xcite .",
    "several ssss and qsss identified in the external galaxies @xcite are associated with diverse types of objects , which include xrbs with a wd , a neutron star ( ns ) , or a stellar - mass black hole ( bh ) as the compact object , ultra - luminous ssss @xcite possibly consisting of an intermediate - mass bh , and snrs @xcite .",
    "the identification studies have further expanded the sss class .    in this paper ,",
    "we re - examined the x - ray observations of the magellanic - type galaxy ngc 4449 to search for the transient x - ray sources . in the following , ",
    "2 describes the observations and data reduction processes used .",
    "we explain the analysis and results in  3 . in  4 , we discuss and conclude the properties of the transient x - ray sources found in ngc 4449 .",
    "we found four sets of archival _ chandra _ observations of ngc 4449 .",
    "the details of the observations are given in table [ obslog ] .",
    "the _ chandra _ observation conducted in 2000 october ( obsid : 938 ) pointed at a target which is @xmath6 arcmin away from ngc 4449 and the sources considered in this analysis were not covered by this observation .",
    "hence we did not include this data in the analysis .",
    "the data from the other three observations were taken with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer spectroscopy array ( acis - s ) , and ngc 4449 was positioned on the back - illuminated s3 chip .",
    "we processed the data using the _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observation ( ciao ) software ( version 4.6 ) and _ chandra _ calibration data base ( caldb ) version 4.6.1.1 .",
    "the source detection routine was carried out in the acis data over the 0.3  8 kev energy band .",
    "we used ciao s mexican - hat wavelet source detection routine , wavdetect @xcite , to detect the x - ray sources in ngc 4449 .",
    "after the production of an exposure map , we ran the wavdetect tool with wavelet scales of 1.4 , 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 pixels and a detection threshold of @xmath7 .    .observation log [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ , > \" , ]     x - ray  to  optical flux ratios can be used to identify the class of the x - ray sources . the flux ratios of stars have wide - range values of typically log@xmath8 , while those of the active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and bl lac objects are @xmath9 @xcite . in smc ,",
    "the x - ray pulsars and high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) have a flux ratio of @xmath10 with @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "all the optical sources , except one source in the tss1 error circle , have the flux ratio @xmath12 .",
    "thus , they are consistent with x - ray pulsars or hmxbs . in smc ,",
    "the be - xrbs dominate the population of hmxbs with @xmath13 to @xmath14 @xcite . at the distance of ngc 4449",
    ", these absolute magnitudes correspond to @xmath15 , and the majority of the optical sources in the error circles are consistent with this range . considering some of them as possible counterparts , they would thus likely be be - hmxbs . however , the colors of these optical sources are in the range of @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath17 $ ] , which are broadly consistent with blue / red bright giants or supergiants . among the transient sources ,",
    "t7 ( x46 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was identified to be associated with a young star cluster of age @xmath18myr .",
    "our analysis also identified the star cluster in the t7 region ( source `` a '' ) , although there are other less bright sources in the region .",
    "using archival _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ , and _ swift _ observations , we studied the transient x - ray sources in the magellanic - type galaxy ngc 4449 .",
    "we found seven transient sources , two of which are classified as ssss because of their extreme soft x - ray colors , four are in the xrb class ( t7 is considered as an xrb ) , and one source belongs to the absorbed class .",
    "these sources were also identified in the previous studies , but our analysis further classified them as transient x - ray sources in ngc 4449 .",
    "the deep sensitivities of _ chandra _ observations have indicated that the transient ssss changed their fluxes by at least 12 orders of magnitude and become undetectable in the later observations .",
    "the spectra of the transient ssss tss1 and tss2 were better described by an absorbed blackbody model , with the temperature ranging from @xmath19 to 105 ev .",
    "the x - ray luminosity in the @xmath20 kev band was @xmath21 for tss1 , while tss2 was less luminous compared to tss1 , with @xmath22 .",
    "the effective blackbody temperatures and luminosities inferred from the x - ray spectra are consistent with the characteristics of steady nuclear burning on @xmath23 wds @xcite .",
    "apart from this , the transient ssss displayed short - term x - ray variability in the x - ray observations , which supports the binary nature of the systems .",
    "the supersoft emission at lower luminosities can be from cooling isolated ns , galactic stars , cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , and agn @xcite .",
    "however , the transient behavior , binary nature , and high x - ray luminosity help to rule out the isolated stars , cvs , and agn as the possible class for the transient ssss .",
    "the x - ray luminosities inferred from _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations are also consistent with those of be / ns x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "be / ns systems dominantly emit hard x - ray radiation , but sometimes a soft excess is also expected along with hard x - ray emission @xcite . for our cases ,",
    "only supersoft x - ray emission was seen , indicating that they unlikely are be / ns binaries .",
    "thus , the transient ssss may belong to the x - ray binary class ( hmxb ) with a wd as the compact object and supersoft x - ray emission is due to the stable nuclear burning on the wd surface .",
    "this possibility is supported by the results from the optical analysis of the images of the source fields .    in tss1",
    ", we found possible periodic variations from one _ chandra _ observation with a timescale of @xmath24h .",
    "considering the timescale as the orbital period , it is actually consistent with those of the luminous ssss in our galaxy , smc and lmc , derived from photometric variations @xcite .",
    "moreover , the post - nova phase of classical , recurrent or symbiotic nova is identified in several ssss and their orbital periods are in the range of @xmath25 min to 5.3 h @xcite .",
    "however with the available data , we covered only a few cycles of the possible modulation , and it is thus hard to clarify the periodic nature of the variability . in order to confirm it",
    ", future sufficiently long x - ray observations are required once it is back to be bright again .",
    "tss1 was detected with _ einstein _",
    ", _ rosat _ , _ chandra _ , and _ xmm - newton _ observations . despite of the ill - sampled observations , the source was possibly active for @xmath26 years and the x - ray luminosity was nearly constant around @xmath21 .",
    "possibly after year 2002 or 2007 the source became undetectable , even in deep _",
    "chandra _ observations .",
    "these results suggest that tss1 may belong to a sub - class of ssss with a small orbital period ( @xmath27 h ) , similar to classical novae , but with long sss phase ( @xmath28 years ) .",
    "such characteristics favor a slightly low mass wd ( @xmath29 ) in the system @xcite .",
    "moreover , tss1 has seemingly shown a decreasing trend in temperature ( @xmath30 to 86 ev ) , which may provide the further support for a lower mass wd system @xcite .",
    "tss2 exhibited short supersoft x - ray phase ( detected only in 2001 observation ) , indicative of a massive wd system @xcite .",
    "the non - detection of x - ray emission from the transient ssss can be due to the exhaustion of nuclear burning on the wd surface .",
    "such scenario is possible for post - nova ssss , if their accretion rate is too low to sustain the steady nuclear surface burning . a nova explosion ( either classical or recurrent ) in future from transient ssss can re - ignite the nuclear burning , which is followed with another bright supersoft x - ray phase @xcite .",
    "this feature gives importance to the future observations of the source field .",
    "the post - nova x - ray emission has been observed in many ssss , for example the first discovered sss nova muscae 1983 ( gq mus ; @xcite ) .",
    "gq mus has been observed to emit in soft x - ray for a long period ( @xmath31 years ; @xcite ) after outburst and later turned off due to the complete consumption of the residual material @xcite . the nova explosion and ssss connection has been well established by the frequent observations of the central region of m31 @xcite . using the dedicated observations in 2006 - 2012 ,",
    "a sample of 79 novae with sss counterparts in m31 has been identified and the duration of their sss phase was determined . among the novae ,",
    "m31n 1996 - 08b and m31n 1997 - 11a were active for more than a decade ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 yr respectively ) in x - rays after their optical discovery @xcite and became undetectable in the later observations @xcite .",
    "since the outburst history is not known for tss1 and tss2 , the turn - off time of these sources can be estimated as @xmath34 and @xmath35 yr respectively ( by assuming the mid point between the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ observations ) . tss1 was detected with most of the x - ray observatories ( see  [ long_lc ] ) , i.e. , active for @xmath26 yr , thus one can argue that tss1 has the longest sss phase known so far followed by the galactic nova v723 cas @xcite , which has the sss turn - off time @xmath36 1819 yr @xcite .",
    "some of the classical ssss exhibited the x - ray off - state for a short timescale .",
    "for example , the prototypical sss cal83 underwent eight temporary x - ray off - states during 1996  2008 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "all the x - ray off - states occurred during optical high states @xcite and their duration is less than 120 d @xcite .",
    "the most likely explanation for the observed x - ray and optical variability is the expansion / contraction of wd s photosphere @xcite . in the case of tss1 and tss2",
    ", one can assume that the x - rays turned off after year 2002 and 2001 ( the last detected x - ray observation ) respectively , but they were not caught in its normal x - ray on - state in any of the later observations .",
    "the available observations could have missed the x - ray on - state and such variability can be confirmed by the continuous monitoring observations in x - ray and optical wavelength .",
    "four less - luminous transient sources ( t3 , t4 , t5 and t6 ) were fitted with an absorbed pl with @xmath37 and their luminosities are @xmath38 eddington luminosity ( @xmath39 ) for ns and bh primaries .",
    "the ns or bh xrbs exhibit the hard - state @xcite spectrum only at luminosities @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "thus , the spectral properties indicate that these sources are possibly ns or bh xrbs at the hard state in ngc 4449 .",
    "source t7 had a steep pl index from the spectral fit , which indicates its soft emission .",
    "the spectral modeling with blackbody model provided a temperature of @xmath41 ev , which is higher than that of the typical ssss , but consistent with qsss @xcite .",
    "qsss in external galaxies are associated with snrs and ns or bh binaries @xcite .",
    "given that the transient nature of t7 rules out the snr classification , a variable qss , associated with a ns or bh x - ray binary , is a rather case for t7 .",
    "[ [ possible - optical - counterparts - and - comparison - with - magellanic - type - galaxies ] ] possible optical counterparts and comparison with magellanic - type galaxies ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    the possible optical counterparts of the transient sources were searched in _",
    "hst _ observations , and we found that the source regions contain multiple optical sources . without information such as correlated variability , it is hard to identify whether these optical sources are the counterparts or not .",
    "also we note that the counterpart of a post - nova system would be too dim to be detected with the _ hst _ observations . in any case , the absolute magnitudes , optical colors and x - ray  to  optical flux ratios of the optical sources in the source regions are broadly consistent with those of hmxbs , if we assume one of the optical sources in each error circle as the counterpart .",
    "in addition , the absolute magnitudes of the majority of the optical sources identified in our analysis are consistent with the range of be - hmxbs in smc @xcite . in the case of ssss",
    ", previous studies suggest that they may have high - mass companions depending on their location in the host galaxy @xcite , and in the nearby galaxies they are associated with early - type stellar systems @xcite .",
    "thus we can argue that tss1 and tss2 are likely wd x - ray binaries with early - type stellar companion , i.e. , wd be / x - ray binaries , in ngc 4449 .",
    "however , such be / wd x - ray binaries are rare and only a few systems ( xmmu j052016.0 - 692505 in lmc , xmmu j010147.5 - 715550 and maxi j0158 - 744 in smc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been reported in the past .",
    "if confirmed , the two transient ssss would be the first be / wd x - ray binary systems identified in ngc 4449 .",
    "finally , the magellanic - type galaxies like lmc , ngc 55 and ngc 4449 have remarkable similarities in their x - ray properties ( see table 12 of * ? ? ?",
    "we further compared the properties of the transient x - ray sources in ngc 4449 with the known transient population of mcs and ngc 55 ( see table 7 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "although the number of the transients in ngc 4449 is low , probably not a sufficient sample , the overall properties of the transient x - ray sources ( fractions of hmxbs and ssss , and their luminosities ) are consistent with that of the other magellanic - type galaxies .",
