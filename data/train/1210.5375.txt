    "local changes in the physical conditions in the solar atmosphere can cause substantial changes in the parameters of observed absorption lines .",
    "in such a situation , the spectral line is said to respond to the structural inhomogeneities which have appeared in the line formation region , and the stronger is the response , the more sensitive is the line to changes in the medium .",
    "comprehensive information on the sensitivity of lines to different atmospheric parameters is essential for solving many problems in the spectrum analysis .",
    "caccin et al . made a fundamental contribution to the problem  using the sensitivity function @xcite and the sensitivity coefficients @xcite , they evaluated the changes in the central depth , halfwidth , and equivalent width of several spectral lines caused by changes in the temperature and microturbulent velocity .",
    "unfortunately , the authors have not analyzed the line sensitivity measure introduced by them , and the sensitivity coefficients did not find wide use because of apparently cumbersome calculations .",
    "when the sensitivity coefficients are calculated , a  variation in a model atmosphere parameter requires that the whole model be recalculated . besides that it is difficult to measure the line sensitivity , since the atmospheric parameters have a combined effect on the line profile and it is not simple to determine the sensitivity to one of them .",
    "studying the contribution and response functions , we have concluded that it is possible to determine the line sensitivity through the use of the response functions by calculating a set of sensitivity parameters .",
    "this way is much more handy as regards calculations though it also needs much machine time .",
    "the prime objective of this study is to develop a technique for calculating the sensitivity parameters based on the response functions , investigate the sensitivity of lines to different atmospheric parameters , and find a way to separating those lines which are highly sensitive to one of the atmospheric parameters and have a low sensitivity to other parameters .",
    "the first section describes the algorithm for calculating the sensitivity parameters for absorption lines which form under the lte conditions ; the second section presents the results for fraunhofer lines ; the third section deals with the scope for application of the sensitivity parameters to the diagnostics of the photosphere ; and in conclusion we give principal inferences and recommendations for choosing the necessary lines .",
    "the calculation of line sensitivity parameters is based on the idea of response functions , which has been developed well enough by many authors @xcite . the literature on the response functions was briefly reviewed by demidov @xcite .",
    "recall that the response function describes the magnitude of response of a line to a local change in an atmospheric parameter at each point in the atmosphere along the line of sight .",
    "it depends on the kind of disturbance and is a function of the wavelength and optical depth .",
    "it is called the emission or the depression response function depending on whether it is calculated for an emission or a depression . the function maxima point to the region in the atmosphere where the emerging emission or depression in the line is the most sensitive to variations in the atmospheric parameters .    to estimate the sensitivity of absorption lines",
    ", we have chosen the depression response functions proposed for the first time in @xcite .",
    "a variation in the observed line depression , @xmath1 , which results from a local disturbance of some atmospheric parameter is determined as @xcite    @xmath2    here @xmath3 is the line depression ; @xmath4 is the response function of the depression ; @xmath5 is the atmospheric parameter which undergoes the disturbance @xmath6 ; @xmath7 is the optical depth in the logarithmic scale ( @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the optical depth at the wavelength @xmath10 nm ) ; @xmath11 is the distance to the line center .",
    "if @xmath6 is not zero in a thin layer @xmath12 in the atmosphere close to the depth @xmath7 , the following approximate equality is true for the depression response function :    @xmath13    it follows from ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) that the response function defines the rate of variation in the line depression @xmath14 at every point @xmath7 in the atmosphere relative to the rate of variation in the parameter @xmath5 which undergoes the local disturbance @xmath6 .",
    "if we integrate the response function with respect to @xmath7 and divide it by the value of the `` emerging '' depression @xmath15 , we obtain a dimensionless quantity which is a variation in the observed depression , @xmath16 , relative to the local variation @xmath6 .",
    "we denote this quantity by @xmath17 and call it the parameter , or the indicator , of the line depression sensitivity .",
    "it is calculated with the expression    @xmath18    as @xmath19 in ( 1 ) is always taken positive , the sign of the sensitivity parameter corresponds to the sign of @xmath20 .",
    "it should be remembered therefore : if the sensitivity parameter @xmath21 is positive , the depression @xmath22 is growing when @xmath5 increases by @xmath23 , and if @xmath21 is negative , @xmath22 is diminishing . by analogy with ( 3 ) , we may define the sensitivity indicator for the line equivalent width :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the integral response function . according to [ 13 ] , it has the form    @xmath26    to calculate the sensitivity parameters with ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , we have first to calculate reliably the depression response functions . for the lte photospheric lines ,",
    "the expression for the depression response function proposed in @xcite may be used :    @xmath27 \\exp \\left ( -{\\frac { \\tau _ r }   { \\mu } }   \\right ) , \\ ] ]    where    @xmath28",
    "@xmath29    here @xmath30 ; @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , @xmath34 are the absorption coefficients and optical depths in the line ( @xmath35 ) and in the continuum ( @xmath36 ) ; @xmath37 is the planck function .",
    "since the response function depends on the kind of disturbance , i.e. , on @xmath5 , it is necessary to calculate the response function for each atmospheric parameter whose effect on the line profile we want to estimate .",
    "let the temperature variation @xmath38 occur in the solar atmosphere , then the depression function of the response to this temperature variation , according to ( 6 ) , is    @xmath39 \\exp \\left ( { -\\frac{\\tau _ r } { \\mu } }   \\right ) .\\ ] ]    similarly we get the expressions for the depression functions of the response to the variations in the gas pressure , @xmath40 ,    @xmath41 \\exp \\left ( { -\\frac{\\tau_r } { \\mu } } \\right ) , \\ ] ]    and in the microturbulent velocity , @xmath42 ,    @xmath43 } { dv}+1 } \\right)\\times\\ ] ]    @xmath44   \\exp \\left ( -\\frac{\\tau_r }   { \\mu }    \\right ) .\\ ] ]    the algorithm for calculating the sensitivity parameters of the fraunhofer lines is based on formulae ( 7)(9 ) .",
    "the calculation program is based on the spansat program for the fraunhofer line calculations @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the temperature sensitivity of a line depends on the line excitation potential , the sensitivity decreasing with increasing potential .",
    "just this rule is commonly used by observers when they choose lines .",
    "however no investigations have thus far been carried out concerning the line sensitivity to other atmospheric parameters and the dependence of the sensitivity on the line atomic parameters such as the wavelength @xmath45 , ionization potential , atomic weight , as well as on the abundance and on the line central depth , equivalent width , and half - width .",
    "the employment of the above technique for calculating the line sensitivity parameters allowed us to elucidate the problem .      [ cols=\"^,<,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     to find lines which are the most sensitive to one atmospheric parameter and at the same time have low sensitivity to other parameters , we calculated and compared the relative variations of line parameters , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , rather than sensitivity indicators , for actually observed fluctuations in the temperature ( 2% ) , gas pressure ( 30% ) , and microturbulent velocity ( 50% ) .",
    "this way proved to be appropriate for finding the necessary lines . here",
    "we give as an example the wavelengths of typical highly sensitive lines in respect to their relative sensitivity .",

    ", we can conclude that the most responsive to temperature are the lines with excitation potentials from 0 to 2 ev , central depths up to 0.35 , equivalent widths to 3 pm .",
    "relative variations of the equivalent widths of these lines are 2530% when the temperature changes by 2% , while they are 27% when the gas pressure changes by 30% and microturbulent velocity by 50% . moderate - strong lines of light atoms with @xmath50 ev are highly responsive to gas pressure . for them",
    ", @xmath51 is as much as 2548% when @xmath52 changes by 30% and is only 26% when @xmath53 changes by 2% and @xmath54 by 50% .",
    "the equivalent widths and half - width depths of strong lines of heavy atoms with @xmath5512 pm and @xmath566 pm are very sensitive to the microturbulent velocity .",
    "for these lines , @xmath47 amounts to 1118% and @xmath57 runs as high as 4570% when @xmath54 changes by 50% , and it is 2% when @xmath52 changes by 30% and @xmath53 by 2% .",
    "as we could make sure , the sensitivity of every line depends on numerous atom and line parameters as well as on the model atmosphere parameters .",
    "it is measured by a diversity of sensitivity indicators with which it is possible to determine the atmospheric parameter producing the strongest response of the line and to estimate the magnitude of the response .",
    "it should be taken into consideration which sensitivity , the absolute or relative one , is more suitable for the particular problem .",
    "our calculations reveal that the lines which form under the lte conditions in the solar atmosphere are the most responsive to temperature variations .",
    "evidence of this is found , for example , in the values of parameters of relative sensitivity to temperature , gas pressure , and microturbulent velocity which attain 15 , 1.5 , 1.5 , respectively ( see table 1 ) .",
    "even minor temperature fluctuations , of the order of 1% , can be observed in the most responsive lines .",
    "fluctuations in the density of matter or in the gas pressure as well as variations in the microturbulent velocity change the line only slightly as compared to temperature . using the lines most responsive to the gas pressure , it is possible to detect only 1015% fluctuations of the pressure in the line formation region .",
    "variations in the microturbulent velocity can be measured from variations in the half - widths and equivalent widths of highly sensitive lines if @xmath58 is about 30% .",
    "direct calculations of the response of line depression to variations in atmospheric parameters for disturbed and undisturbed model atmospheres , confirm that the sensitivity indicators can be used for the solar atmosphere diagnostics in those cases when fluctuations in @xmath53 , @xmath52 , and @xmath54 do not exceed 8% , 50% , and 100% , respectively .",
    "it is better to use the response functions themselves when fine spectral analysis problems are solved .",
    "a detailed analysis of the shape of response functions can give an additional valuable inftyormation .",
    "the results of our analysis show that the sensitivity indicators proposed for measuring the fraunhofer line response do not lack a physical meaning .",
