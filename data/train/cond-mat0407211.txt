    "image states @xcite are a special class of weakly bound surface electronic states in which an electron outside a dielectric or conductor polarises the surface and is then attracted to the resulting `` image charge '' .",
    "asymptotically the potential varies like @xmath6 so that a band gap preventing penetration of electrons into the crystal leads to a rydberg - like series of states which in the case of a purely coulombic image force at a planar metal surface arise at energies @xmath7/n^2+\\hbar^2k^2/2m$ ] , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the electron wave vector parallel to the surface and @xmath10 the electron mass .",
    "deviations from this behaviour reflect the influence and response of the surface - dependant electronic and atomic structure , which may therefore be investigated by studying image states .",
    "examples of theoretical and experimental work include the systematics of image states binding and dispersion on clean surfaces @xcite , image state on overlayers @xcite , at stepped metal surfaces @xcite , exchange splitting of image states at ferromagnets @xcite , as well as image states at surface nanostructures @xcite .",
    "in recent years there has also been considerable interest in the dynamics of image state electron @xcite as model electronic excitations at surfaces .",
    "one aspect of the physics of image state electrons that has yet to be addressed is the influence of the spin orbit interaction @xmath11 @xcite which has recently been found to have a significant effect on other surface state electron levels at the surfaces of conductors with high atomic number @xcite . at first sight",
    "the spin - orbit interaction might be expected to be negligible .",
    "the mathematical analogy that can be drawn between the schrdinger equation describing the electrons moving in the coulomb - like image potential and that of @xmath12-electrons in the hydrogen atom enable the image state wavefunctions to be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the normalised radial hydrogenic wavefunction and @xmath15 a pauli spinor : @xmath16 . using these wavefunctions to diagonalise",
    "the spin - orbit perturbation @xmath17 in the subspace of degenerate image state levels gives a spin - orbit splitting of @xmath18\\frac{k}{n^3}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the fine structure constant .",
    "this is well below the current resolution of inverse photoemission , two - photon photoemission or scanning tunnelling spectroscopy .",
    "however , it has previously been recognised that a more significant contribution to the spin - orbit splitting of `` crystal  derived '' surface states arises from the brief time spent by the electron in the vicinity of the nuclei of the surface atoms , where the gradient contribution to the spin - orbit interaction is @xmath20 . in this paper",
    "we report on calculations that we have performed to quantify the magnitude of the spin - orbit splitting that arises from the penetration of the image state wave function into the crystal at surfaces of ir , pt and au .",
    "these are described in section [ section : rlkkr ] . in section [ section :",
    "phase ] we describe the modification of the phase accumulation model for image state energetics to include the effects of the spin orbit interaction .",
    "finally , we summarise and discuss our findings .",
    "to calculate the spin - orbit splitting of image states we use a recently developed code that implements relativistic multiple - scattering theory .",
    "the theory behind this method is essentially that described by halilov _",
    "@xcite so we do not reproduce it in detail here .",
    "the basic idea is that the electronic structure is found from the single - particle green function corresponding to the dirac hamiltonian @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "thus spin - orbit effects are treated non - perturbatively . using scattering techniques the green function",
    "is determined for the special case of semi - infinite crystals with two - dimensional in - plane translational periodicity , treating intralayer scattering within an angular momentum representation and interlayer scattering in a plane wave representation .",
    "our calculations use 25 and 19 two - dimensional reciprocal lattice vectors to describe the interlayer scattering for the ( 001 ) and ( 111 ) surfaces respectively , and partial waves up to @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the semi - infinite substrate means that continuum and surface - localised states are clearly distinguished in the wave vector resolved local density of states , found from the imaginary part of the green function . as in the non - relativistic version of the code @xcite the electronic structure",
    "is found self - consistently using the local density approximation to density functional theory .",
    "we use the atomic sphere approximation for the crystal potential ( including dipole contributions ) , with the potential in the three outermost atomic layers allowed to vary in response to the presence of the surface . since the local density approximation does not lead to an image - like surface barrier , and hence does not support image states , once self - consistency has been achieved we replace the self - consistent barrier with a parameterised model barrier , for which we use the `` jjj '' potential @xcite @xmath23 the fitting parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 were fixed by starting with values quoted by smith _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who fitted to first - principles slab calculations , and then adjusted slightly to place the @xmath2 image state at @xmath27 , @xmath28 , close to values found experimentally .",
    "the procedure does not uniquely fix the parameters , but we found that different combinations that gave the same value for @xmath28 resulted in almost identical image state dispersion curves .",
    "note that our results are for the @xmath29 unreconstructed surfaces of the materials studied .",
    "in several cases the surfaces undergo complex surface reconstructions ( e.g. au(001 ) and pt(001 ) adopt a @xmath30 reconstruction but may be prepared in the @xmath29 structure  see @xcite ) .",
    "= 160 mm    in figure [ fig : splits ] we illustrate the dispersion curves that we find . for both pt(111 ) and au(001 ) the spin - orbit interaction can clearly be seen to split the @xmath2 image state , and whilst a splitting exists for the @xmath31 and higher states it is much smaller .",
    "the inset in the figure [ fig : splits]a illustrates the variation of the splitting with wave vector @xmath32 , the near - linear variation corresponding to a rashba - like dispersion @xcite @xmath33 from curves such as these we extract rashba - parameters @xmath1 by a least - square fit using wave vectors @xmath34 .",
    "these values are tabulated in table [ table : results ] for the image states at the ( 111 ) and ( 001 ) surfaces of ir , pt and au . at au(111 )",
    "the vacuum level lies outside of the projected band gap so that the image states in this case exist as resonances .",
    "we have not therefore included results for this case , but instead give the results that we find for the spin orbit splitting of the occupied surface state that occurs within the band gap at this surface .",
    "the dispersion of this state is shown also in figure [ fig : splits ] , and agrees well with previous work , validating our procedure .",
    "we find the wave vector splitting at the fermi energy is @xmath35 , compared with experimental values of @xmath36 @xcite , @xmath37 @xcite and @xmath38 @xcite , and a theoretical value of @xmath36 @xcite that have been reported previously .",
    ".[table : results]calculated image state energies including the spin - orbit interaction at @xmath39 and @xmath40 surfaces of ir , pt and au : @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 values in brackets are from experiment . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the results in table [ table : results ] indicate that the spin - orbit splitting of @xmath2 image states at ir , pt and au surfaces is an order of magnitude smaller than that of the au(111 ) shockley surface state , and that of the @xmath31 states smaller still .",
    "these trends reflect the differing extents to which the corresponding wave functions penetrate the crystal and experience the spin - orbit interaction at the ion cores . at the ( 001 ) surfaces @xmath43 which might be expected given the increasing atomic number ( @xmath44 ) , but at the ( 111 ) surface @xmath45 , pointing to a more complicated `` band - structure '' effect . in figure",
    "[ fig : splits ] the splitting of the au(001 ) @xmath2 image state is also seen to be affected as it disperses towards the band edge of continuum levels .",
    "we return to this later .",
    "the `` standard model '' for understanding image state energies is the phase accumulation model @xcite in which surface states are envisaged as one - dimensional waves trapped by multiple reflection from the surface barrier and the crystal . in a region of constant potential ( see figure [ fig : phase ] ) between barrier and crystal ( which may be infinitesimal in width ) the electron wave function can be expressed in terms of forward and backward travelling plane waves @xmath46 the two components are related at the barrier reference plane @xmath47 by the barrier reflection coefficient @xmath48 , @xmath49 and at the crystal reference plane @xmath50 by the crystal reflection coefficient @xmath51 , @xmath52 which together with ( [ eqn : wave ] ) give rise to the condition for a surface state to exist : @xmath53 for energies below the vacuum level and coincident with the crystal band gap the reflection probability at both crystal and barrier are unity and the reflection coefficients may be written in terms of phases : @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "the surface state condition then becomes @xmath56 which is a condition on the round - trip phase accumulated by the electron wave .",
    "the phases in ( [ eqn : phase ] ) increase with energy .",
    "the crystal phase increases from 0 to @xmath57 as the energy sweeps across the band gap , changing most rapidly near the band edges . towards the bottom of the gap it is",
    "this variation in @xmath58 which will determine whether or not ( [ eqn : phase ] ) is satisfied , so that any surface state that does arise is usually referred to as `` crystal - derived '' . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath59 increases more and more rapidly as the energy approaches the vacuum energy , varying to a good approximation as @xmath60 in combination with ( [ eqn : phase ] ) this yields a rydberg - like series of image states @xmath61 where the quantum defect @xmath62/\\pi)/2 $ ] may usually be considered constant over the range of energies at which the image states are found .",
    "= 80 mm    we now consider the extension of this model to include the spin orbit interaction .",
    "introducing the electron spin in to the wavefunction in ( [ eqn : wave ] ) @xmath63 and reflection from the crystal is now described by a matrix @xmath64 allowing for the possibility of spin - flip upon reflection . with a similar matrix used to describe scattering from the barrier ,",
    "the condition for a surface state becomes @xmath65=0 .",
    "\\label{eqn : det}\\ ] ]    the four reflection coefficients in ( [ eqn : rc ] ) are not independent  for example flux conservation requires that @xmath66 within a gap , and for a non - magnetic crystal @xmath67 . in the non - magnetic case and for a planar potential @xmath68 the electron wave functions @xmath69 are found from the hamiltonian @xmath70 which may be diagonalised by a rotation in spin space @xmath71 with @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the angle of the electron wave vector .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath74 does not mix spin - up and spin - down channels and so in this representation the reflection matrix describing scattering from the crystal is diagonal : @xmath75 since the spin - orbit interaction is negligible in the barrier the barrier reflection matrix is also diagonal , and for a non - magnetic surface @xmath76 so that the surface state condition ( [ eqn : det ] ) becomes @xmath77 leading to the round - trip phase condition @xmath78 where we have introduced @xmath79 appropriate to energies within a gap .",
    "the surface states now come in spin - split pairs , with spin orientations that may be deduced from the spinors that are obtained by rotating back in to the original reference frame the spin - up and -down eigenspinors @xmath80 of the primed frame : @xmath81 thus @xmath82 and we find that the spins lie in the surface plane and perpendicular to @xmath83 , to the left ( right ) for @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) .    rotating back to the original spin frame gives the reflection matrix ( [ eqn : rc ] ) as @xmath86 in figure [ fig : tan ] we illustrate the variation in @xmath87 at the au(001 ) surface calculated from the reflection matrix found using the relativistic multiple - scattering method of section [ section : rlkkr ] . for @xmath9 along @xmath88 ( see inset in figure [ fig : tan ] ) equation ( [ eqn : rc ] ) @xmath89 .",
    "the relativistic multiple - scattering calculations include the atomic structure of the surface and the crystal potential is not one - dimensional , but the reflection coefficient for specular reflection behaves in a very similar manner to that of a one - dimensional crystal , especially for small @xmath32 where the wave function varies only slowly across the surface .",
    "in particular we find that the angular variation predicted by equation ( [ eqn : rc ] ) is satisfied to within a percent or so .",
    "it is evident from figure [ fig : tan ] that the magnitude of the spin - orbit induced phase change is small , and away from the band edges @xmath90 is approximately independent of energy at au(001 ) and linear in @xmath32 : @xmath91 k$ ] .    to first order",
    "the round - trip phase condition ( [ eqn : phase2 ] ) is satisfied at energies @xmath92 where @xmath93 neglecting the energy dependence of @xmath90 which is small compared to the other phases . for all the surfaces that we have studies we have found that @xmath90 does not change sign across the band gap , and the denominator in ( [ eqn : energies ] ) is positive .",
    "hence the model predicts a series of spin - orbit split states with identical spin orderings , which we have confirmed is also the case in the relativistic multiple scattering calculations described in section [ section : rlkkr ] . in particular with @xmath94 the surface states that exist are split with the lower of each pair of levels having the spin pointing to the right of @xmath9 , as shown in figure [ fig : spin ] .",
    "this is in agreement with the spin assignments shown in henk _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for the au(111 ) surface state , but disagrees with those given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "= 50 mm    when the gap contains image states , over the narrow range of energies within which the image states are found the energy - dependence of the round - trip phase is dominated by the variation in the barrier phase ( [ eqn : barphase ] ) and then @xmath95 thus the spin - splittings exhibit the same scaling as the lifetime broadening @xcite , in each case the behaviour ultimately originating in the variation with @xmath96 of the wave function overlap with the crystal .",
    "we also see from ( [ eqn : de ] ) that the linear - in-@xmath32 behaviour of @xmath97 arises from similar behaviour in @xmath90 . since @xmath90 is small @xmath98 to a good approximation , and hence @xmath99 .",
    "thus the spin - orbit splitting is directly related to the spin - flip scattering rate , which could therefore be determined from experimental values of image state splittings . at au(001 ) , @xmath100 mev ( table [ table : results ] ) , so combining equations ( [ eqn : ryd ] ) and ( [ eqn : de ] ) gives @xmath101 and a splitting of 22 mev ( figure [ fig : splits ] ) at @xmath102 @xmath103 yields @xmath104 , which agrees with the value found from the multiple - scattering calculations shown in figure [ fig : tan ] .",
    "finally , we note that equation ( [ eqn : de ] ) will not hold near band edges where the energy - dependence of the crystal phase @xmath58 can not be neglected .",
    "this is the origin of the anomalous dispersion shown for the @xmath2 state at au(001 ) in figure [ fig : splits ] .",
    "to summarise , we have investigated the effect of the spin - orbit interaction on image state electrons at the ( 111 ) and ( 001 ) surfaces of ir , pt , and au .",
    "non - perturbative calculations that use relativistic multiple - scattering theory with self - consistent potentials and a parameterised surface barrier predict rashba - like dispersion of the image state bands with splittings for @xmath2 that are a factor 10 - 20 times smaller than that of the au(111 ) shockley state , for which our results are in good agreement with experiment and previous theory . extending the phase accumulation model to include spin - orbit scattering",
    ", we find that the splittings scale as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the quantum defect , and are directly related to the spin - flip scattering rate at the surface .",
    "the largest image state splittings we find are at au(001 ) for which @xmath105 mev at @xmath102 @xmath103 .",
    "this is larger than some exchange splittings of image states that have previously been resolved ( e.g. @xmath106 mev at ni(111 ) @xcite and @xmath107 mev at ni(001 ) @xcite ) by exploiting the spin resolution available in spin - resolved inverse photoemission , suggesting that the spin - orbit splitting may also be observable with an appropriate experimental set - up .",
    "the splittings are comparable to lifetime broadenings of late - transition and noble metal image states @xcite , indicating that account of spin - orbit effects may be necessary when determining image state lifetimes from lineshape analysis for 5@xmath108 metals .",
