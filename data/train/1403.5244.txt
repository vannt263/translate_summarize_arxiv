    "<S> for a narrow band of values of the top quark and higgs boson masses , the standard model higgs potential develops a shallow local minimum at energies of about @xmath0 gev , where primordial inflation could have started in a cold metastable state . for each point of that band , the highness of the higgs potential at the false minimum is calculable , and there is an associated prediction for the inflationary gravitational wave background , namely for the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the recent measurement of @xmath1 by the bicep2 collaboration , @xmath2 at @xmath3 , combined with the most up - to - date measurements of the top quark and higgs boson masses , reveals that the hypothesis that a standard model shallow false minimum was the source of inflation in the early universe is viable .    </S>",
    "<S> the fact that , for a narrow band of values of the top quark and higgs boson masses , the standard model ( sm ) higgs potential develops a local minimum @xcite is very interesting , as this happens at energy scales of about @xmath0 gev which are suitable for inflation in the early universe .    inflation from a local minimum @xcite is a viable scenario , provided a graceful exit to a radiation - dominated era can be obtained via some mechanism beyond the sm . developing a model with graceful exit in the framework of a scalar - tensor theory of gravity @xcite , in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we pointed out that the hypothesis that inflation took place in a sm shallow false vacuum was consistent only with a narrow range of values of the higgs boson mass , which subsequently turned out to be compatible with the experimental range indicated by atlas and cms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these very suggestive results provide a strong motivation to further investigate the scenario of sm false vacuum inflation , by looking for complementary experimental tests . </S>",
    "<S> inflation can generate tensor ( gravity wave ) modes as well as scalar ( density perturbation ) modes . </S>",
    "<S> it is common to define the tensor contribution through @xmath1 , the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbation spectra at large scales . if inflation happened at a very high scale , as is the case for the sm false vacuum scenario , quantum fluctuations during inflation produced a background of gravitational waves with a relatively large amplitude .    </S>",
    "<S> as argued in @xcite , the tensor to scalar ratio , combined with the top quark and higgs boson mass measurements , does represent a test of the hypothesis that inflation started from the sm false vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> the upper bounds on @xmath1 provided by the wmap @xcite and planck experiments @xcite were too weak for the sake of such test . </S>",
    "<S> it was anyway possible to conclude @xcite that , for the sm false vacuum to be a realistic inflationary scenario , an experimental detection of @xmath1 would have been possible in the case that the top quark mass turned out to be close to its lower allowed value at @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> the recent measurement of @xmath1 by the bicep2 collaboration @xcite , @xmath5 at @xmath3 , on the one hand represents a hint in favor of the hypothesis that inflation took place in the sm shallow false vacuum and , on the other hand , allows to perform a sensible test of the allowed parameter space for such scenario . </S>",
    "<S> that is the goal of the present letter .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the higgs potential in the sm of particle physics . </S>",
    "<S> for very large values of the higgs field @xmath6 , the quadratic term @xmath7 can be neglected and we are left with the quartic term , whose dimensionless coupling @xmath8 depends on the energy scale , which can be identified with the field @xmath6 itself : @xmath9 it is well known that , for some narrow band of the higgs and top masses , the higgs potential develops a new local minimum @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> if the higgs field is trapped in a cold coherent state in the false minimum @xmath10 and dominates the energy density of the universe , the standard friedmann equation leads to a stage of inflationary expansion h^2 h_i^2 , a(t)e^h_i t , [ eq - m ] where @xmath11 is the scale factor , @xmath12 is the hubble rate and @xmath13 gev is the reduced planck mass .    </S>",
    "<S> a nontrivial model - dependent ingredient is how to achieve a graceful exit from inflation . in order to end inflation </S>",
    "<S> the higgs field has to tunnel to the other side of the potential barrier by nucleating bubbles  @xcite that eventually collide and percolate . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently the higgs field could roll down the potential , reheat the universe and relax in the electroweak vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> a graceful exit can be generically realized only if at the end of inflation there is a very shallow false minimum , otherwise the tunneling rate becomes negligibly small , the probability being exponentially sensitive to the barrier @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the potential is thus very close to an inflection point configuration . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a powerful generic prediction for the scale of inflation , and therefore for @xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so , if the false vacuum is very shallow , the specific model only affects the prediction for the spectral index of cosmological density perturbations @xmath14 , see e.g. the models of refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    using the renormalization group equations ( rge ) at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) , _ i.e. _ 3-loops for beta functions @xcite and the 2-loops for matching conditions @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we investigated @xcite the values of the top quark and higgs masses allowing for the presence of a second degenerate minimum or a shallow local minimum at high scale . for the technical details on the rge procedure at nnlo we refer the interested reader to ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , while here we summarize only the issues relevant for the present work .    </S>",
    "<S> the are two main sources of uncertainty in the rge calculation at nnlo . </S>",
    "<S> the first is of experimental nature and is associated to the uncertainty in the determination of the value of @xmath15 , for which the pdg @xcite gives the range @xmath16 at @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the second is of theoretical nature and is associated to the matching conditions . </S>",
    "<S> as suggested in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , using the value of the top mass in the @xmath17 scheme , @xmath18 , one has to consider only the theoretical uncertainty associated to the matching of @xmath8 ; this kind of top mass is experimentally known with a quite large @xmath3 error , @xmath19 gev according to @xcite , and @xmath20 gev according to the pdg @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> using instead the top pole mass , the theoretical error becomes bigger because one has to include also the uncertainty associated to the matching of the top yukawa coupling ( see e.g. @xcite ) ; the top pole mass @xmath21 is however known quite accurately , @xmath22 gev at @xmath3 according to the pdg @xcite , and @xmath23 gev according to the recent combination of the atlas , cdf , cms , d0 measurements @xcite . in the present analysis , as a crosscheck , we adopt both procedures , finding that the two methods essentially provide similar results ( as they should ) , even though the second method is somewhat more stringent .    </S>",
    "<S> we first start with the analysis based on the @xmath17 top mass . in fig.[fig-1 ] , the ( red and orange ) lines spanning the @xmath4 range of @xmath15 , show the points in the @xmath24 plane where the shallow sm false minima exists . </S>",
    "<S> the thickness of the lines is associated to the theoretical uncertainty of the nnlo procedure , due to the matching of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter are extremely close to the line marking the transition from stability to metastability ( two degenerate vacua ) , so that it is not possible to distinguish them by eye , the difference being a few mev for the top mass @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ( green ) shaded horizontal region corresponds to the @xmath25 range @xmath19 gev , as calculated in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ( pink ) shaded vertical regions are the 1 and 2 @xmath26 ranges of @xmath27 according to the pdg @xcite . the shallow false minimum configuration ( and , </S>",
    "<S> more generally , any configuration close to it , like e.g. two degenerate minima ) is thus compatible with the higgs and top quark mass values , provided the latter is quite light .    , taken to vary in its @xmath4 range . </S>",
    "<S> the ( green ) shaded horizontal region corresponds to the @xmath25 range @xmath19 gev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ( pink ) shaded vertical regions are the 1 and 2 @xmath26 ranges of @xmath27 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ( blue ) shaded bands are the @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xmath26 ranges of bicep2 , @xmath30 @xcite ; for reference , also the value @xmath31 is displayed . , width=283 ]    .2 cm    for each shallow false minimum configuration the highness of the higgs potential at the false minimum , @xmath32 , can be calculated and , thanks to eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq - m ] ) , the same is true for @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> let now consider the tensor to scalar ratio of cosmological perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of density fluctuations in the observed universe as seen by the cmb and large - scale structure data is parametrized by the power spectrum in @xmath34-space p_s(k)=_r^2 ( ) ^n_s-1 , where @xmath35 is the amplitude at some pivot point @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the best - fit value from @xcite , @xmath37 at @xmath38 .    in any inflationary model that can be analyzed through the slow - roll approximation </S>",
    "<S> , there is a relationship between the scale of inflation , the amplitude of density perturbations , and the amount of gravity waves that can be produced : _ </S>",
    "<S> r^2 = . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq - r ] if inflation actually started from a sm shallow false minimum , then each point in the @xmath24 plane has to be associated with a specific value of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this is done in fig.[fig-1 ] , where the ( blue ) shaded bands represents the @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xmath26 ranges of bicep2 measurement @xmath30 @xcite ; for reference , also the value @xmath31 is displayed . taking into account the theoretical error in the determination of the position of the false minimum ( the thickness of the red and orange lines ) , the position of the ( blue ) @xmath1 bands is also uncertain by about @xmath39 gev along the vertical axis .    </S>",
    "<S> one can see that , given the results from bicep2 , the shallow false minimum is a viable framework for models of higgs inflation provided that : i ) the higgs mass is close to its upper 1 - 2 @xmath26 range , more precisely between @xmath40 and @xmath41 gev , or ii ) both @xmath15 and the top mass @xmath18 are quite small , say respectively close to the lower 1 - 2 @xmath26 range ( between @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) and between @xmath44 and @xmath45 gev . clearly , the smaller is @xmath1 , the more the three previous parameters can go in the direction of their central values . </S>",
    "<S> it will thus be important to further improve the @xmath1 measurement in the future .     </S>",
    "<S> show the points where the sm false vacuum configuration is realized , their thickness being the theoretical error in the nnlo rge procedure . </S>",
    "<S> the ( green ) shaded horizontal region corresponds to the @xmath28 and @xmath28 @xmath26 ranges of the combined measurement by the atlas , cdf , cms , d0 collaborations , @xmath23 gev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ( pink ) shaded vertical regions are the 1 and 2 @xmath26 ranges of @xmath27 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ( blue ) shaded bands are the @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xmath26 ranges of bicep2 , @xmath30 @xcite ; for reference , also the value @xmath31 is displayed . </S>",
    "<S> , width=283 ]    .2 cm    the same conclusions can be drawn by making the analysis using the top pole mass , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig-2 ] . as the theoretical error has to include also the uncertainty due to the matching of the top yukawa coupling , the thickness of the lines is bigger than with the previous method , and turns out to be about @xmath46 gev in the vertical axis ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for the sake of clearness </S>",
    "<S> , we thus display only three lines , corresponding the the central and @xmath4 values of @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the theoretical error in the determination of the position of the false minimum ( the thickness of the red and orange lines ) , the position of the ( blue ) bands representing the bicep2 result is also uncertain by a shift along the vertical axis of about @xmath46 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the ( green ) shaded horizontal regions show the 1 and 2 @xmath26 ranges of the combined measurement by the atlas , cdf , cms , d0 collaborations , @xmath23 gev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ( pink ) shaded vertical regions are the 1 and 2 @xmath26 ranges of @xmath27 according to the pdg @xcite .    also from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig-2 ] one can see again that , for the shallow false minimum configuration , the bicep2 results are compatible with the present ranges for @xmath15 , @xmath27 , @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the overlapping requires : @xmath21 close to its lower @xmath4 value , @xmath27 close to its upper @xmath4 value , @xmath15 close to its central one .    notice that the bicep2 result at @xmath3 , @xmath30 @xcite , corresponds to the range @xmath47 gev , and to @xmath48 gev .    summarizing , we have argued that the present status of the measurements of @xmath1 , @xmath21 , @xmath27 , @xmath15 , is consistent with of the hypothesis @xcite that inflation occurred in a sm shallow false vacuum at about @xmath49 gev . to account for the bicep2 result at @xmath3 , @xmath30 @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the top quark mass should be close to its lower @xmath4 range , while the higgs mass should be close to its @xmath50 upper one , see figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig-1 ] and [ fig-2 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> it is intriguing that for such values of the top and higgs masses , the quadratic divergences of the higgs mass ( corresponding to the running veltman condition ) cancel at the planck scale , see fig . 2 of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> future precision measurements of the top quark and higgs masses will thus be crucial to further test the sm shallow false minimum inflationary scenario . </S>"
