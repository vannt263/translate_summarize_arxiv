    "a challenging problem in the general theory of relativity is finding exact solutions of the einstein field equations .",
    "while a solution does not have to be exact to be valid , finding an exact solution does have one distinct advantage : it often yields physical insights or unexpected connections that a numerical solution can not .",
    "this paper offers an extreme example of an exact solution that models two completely diverse structures , traversable wormholes and dark - matter models for galactic rotation curves .",
    "the latter case even suggests that a constant tangential velocity could have been anticipated based on the einstein field equations .    for the former case let us recall that wormholes are handles or tunnels in spacetime connecting different regions of our universe or different universes altogether . that wormholes could be actual physical structures suitable for interstellar travel was first proposed by morris and thorne @xcite . for the wormhole spacetime they assumed the following static spherically symmetric line element @xmath3 using units in which @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 is called the _ redshift function _ , which must be everywhere finite to avoid an event horizon .",
    "the function @xmath6 helps determine the spatial shape of the wormhole and is therefore called the _ shape",
    "function_. the spherical surface @xmath7 is the _ throat _ of the wormhole and must satisfy the following conditions : @xmath8 , @xmath9 for @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , now usually called the _ flare - out condition_. this condition refers to the flaring out of the embedding diagram pictured in ref .",
    "the flare - out condition can only be satisfied by violating the null energy condition .",
    "an apparently unrelated topic is the existence of galactic rotation curves .",
    "here we need to recall the well - known problem that rotation curves of neutral hydrogen clouds in the outer regions of the galactic halo can not be explained in terms ordinary luminous matter .",
    "this phenomenon has led to the hypothesis that galaxies and even clusters of galaxies are pervaded by _",
    "dark matter_. the spacetime in the galactic halo region is characterized by the line element    @xmath12    to be discussed in sec .",
    "[ s : rotation ] .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that both models can be obtained from the same exact solution of the einstein field equations given the barotropic equation of state @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , for all practical purposes this solution is the most general possible exact solution obtainable .",
    "the numerical value of the parameter @xmath13 then becomes the primary distinguisher between the two models .",
    "our first step is to list the einstein field equations @xcite : @xmath14 @xmath15,\\ ] ] and @xmath16,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the energy density , @xmath18 is the radial pressure , and @xmath19 the lateral pressure .    the barotropic equation of state ( eos ) @xmath20 has been used in various cosmological settings , where the pressure is necessarily isotropic .",
    "since this section deals strictly with wormholes , the pressure is now the radial pressure , leading to the eos @xmath21 also discussed by lobo @xcite .",
    "the transverse pressure is then determined from eq .",
    "( [ e : einstein3 ] ) . more importantly , however , for the special case @xmath22 discussed below , the extension to spherically symmetric inhomogeneous spacetimes has been carried out .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details . )",
    "we are going to find an exact solution that yields several special cases .",
    "exact solutions were discussed by kuhfittig @xcite and earlier by lobo @xcite and zaslavskii @xcite ) . to meet the goals in this paper , we need to find the most general possible exact solution . here",
    "it turns out to be convenient to start with the line element @xmath23 from line element ( [ e : line1 ] ) we have @xmath24 . substituting eqs .",
    "( [ e : einstein1 ] ) and ( [ e : einstein2 ] ) in the eos @xmath25 , we obtain @xmath26 this equation can be solved by separation of variables only if @xmath27 ( @xmath28 or if @xmath29 is defined by @xmath30 [ @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "the former case yields lobo s solution @xcite @xmath33 in the latter case we have @xmath34 showing that eq .",
    "( [ e : red1 ] ) is the only other choice that allows @xmath35 to be factored out , thereby separating variables : @xmath36 the solution is @xmath37    _ remark 1 : _ the motivation for this solution was clearly a mathematical one , seeking to obtain the most general possible exact solution .",
    "a natural physical interpretation is possible , however , for a standard perfect fluid with @xmath38 . in this classical scenario ,",
    "solutions corresponding to the linear ( isothermal ) eos @xmath0 , @xmath39 , had been studied earlier by chandrasekhar @xcite .",
    "in this section we specialize the exact solution ( [ e : solution1 ] ) to the study of wormholes .    from @xmath40 and the requirement @xmath8",

    "( [ e : lobo ] ) . both assume a phantom - energy background , i.e. , @xmath22 in the eos @xmath25 .",

    "this confirms the violation of the null energy condition : @xmath50 since eq .",

    "( [ e : red1 ] ) , we have also shown that eq .",
    "( [ e : line4 ] ) is for all practical purposes the most general possible exact wormhole solution given a barotropic equation of state .",
    "_ remark 2 : _ for the sake of completeness it should be noted that we have obtained the most general possible exact solution for specific choices of @xmath29 that do not depend directly on @xmath52 and @xmath53",
    "@xcite discusses the more abstract form @xmath54\\lambda'(r)$ ] for some function @xmath55 that yields an exact solution of eq .",
    "( [ e : diff1 ] ) . however , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the choices for @xmath55 that simultaneously avoid an event horizon are extremely limited and so have little bearing on the present study .",
    "even though the flare - out condition is satisfied at the throat , we still have to examine the vicinity of the throat , in particular the allowed range on the parameter @xmath56 .",
    "we first need to observe , however , that our wormhole spacetime is not asymptotically flat and must therefore be cut off at some @xmath57 and joined to an external vacuum solution .",
    "suppose we write the shape function in the form @xmath58 for @xmath59 , since @xmath60 is a convenient measure of the distance from the throat .",
    "then the derivative becomes @xmath61 this form explains why there are two special cases : if @xmath44 , then the second term is zero and @xmath62 , so that @xmath9 .",
    "( observe that @xmath63 must be greater than zero by eq .",
    "( [ e : einstein1 ] ) . )",
    "if @xmath46 , then the first term is zero and @xmath64 and @xmath65 since @xmath59 .    for the general case , the effect of the parameter @xmath56 is more complicated",
    ". suppose we consider the interval @xmath66 , where @xmath57 is the cut - off mentioned earlier .",
    "then @xmath67 for some @xmath68 , and by using eq . (",
    "[ e : bprime2 ] ) , we can plot @xmath69 versus @xmath56 ( using some arbitrary value for @xmath13 ) , shown in fig . 1 .",

    ", at @xmath57 , @xmath70 , so that @xmath71 , and @xmath72 for all @xmath73 for some @xmath74 that depends on both @xmath75 and @xmath13 . for @xmath76 , we get a valid wormhole solution that includes both lobo s and zaslavskii s solutions . to understand the behavior for @xmath77 , consider @xmath78 from eq .",
    "( [ e : bprime2 ] ) . solving for @xmath75 , we find that @xmath79 is implicitly determined by @xmath80 which is well - defined since @xmath81 . it should be noted that fig . 1 is particularly helpful here because @xmath74 can not be explicitly solved for .",
    "moreover , the restriction @xmath73 is most severe at @xmath57 , i.e. , for any @xmath82 , the above conditions on @xmath83 are automatically met on the interval @xmath84 $ ] , as can be seen from fig .",
    "2 .     and @xmath85 , @xmath86 , plotted versus @xmath56.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "as noted in the previous section , our wormhole spacetime is not asymptotically flat and must be cut off at some @xmath57 and joined to an exterior scharzschild solution @xmath87 to facilitate the discussion , let us consider the cases @xmath76 and @xmath77 separately ,      the junction at the cut - off requires continuity of the metric . as noted in refs .",
    "@xcite , the components @xmath88 and @xmath89 are already continuous due to the spherical symmetry .",
    "so we need to impose the continuity requirement only on the remaining components at @xmath57 .",
    "these requirements imply that @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "in particular , we must have @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is given in eq .",
    "( [ e : shape1 ] ) .",
    "also @xmath94 whence @xmath95 while the metric is now continuous at the junction surface , the derivatives may not be .",
    "this needs to be taken into account when discussing the surface stresses ; these are @xmath96 , the surface stress - energy , and @xmath97 , the surface pressure .",
    "the following forms , proposed by lobo @xcite , are suitable for present purposes : @xmath98 and @xmath99\\sqrt{1-\\frac{b(r_1)}{r_1 } }     \\right).\\ ] ] since @xmath100 , the surface stress - energy @xmath96 is zero . from @xmath101 , we find that @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "so eq . ( [ e : pressure1 ] ) becomes @xmath104.\\ ] ] letting @xmath92 and simplifying , we get @xmath105 since @xmath76 and @xmath106 .",
    "also , from eq .",
    "( [ e : einstein2 ] ) , @xmath107,\\ ] ] it follows that @xmath108 is negative .",
    "such a combination is to be expected since a negative radial pressure is needed to balance a positive surface pressure .      for positive @xmath56 ,",
    "our exact solution has a particularly interesting property : we can choose @xmath57 in such a way that the surface stresses are zero . such a surface is called a _",
    "boundary surface_. to see how , we can use eq .",
    "( [ e : shape1 ] ) to find @xmath109 if @xmath75 is chosen so that @xmath78 and @xmath79 , then we get from eq .",
    "( [ e : alpha ] ) , @xmath110 it now follows from eq .",
    "( [ e : pressure2 ] ) that @xmath111 .",
    "since we already have @xmath112 , we conclude that for the case @xmath77 , we can choose the cut - off @xmath57 in such a way that the junction surface is a boundary surface .",
    "we also note that from eq .",
    "( [ e : radial ] ) , @xmath113 , as expected .",
    "returning to line element ( [ e : line3 ] ) , if we use the form of @xmath114 in eq .",
    "( [ e : red1 ] ) , we can recover line element ( [ e : line2 ] ) , restated here for convenience : @xmath115 to interpret this result , let us assume that @xmath116 in the equation @xmath0 .",
    "so we are no longer dealing with wormholes .",
    "instead , the eos has a cosmological interpretation as a perfect fluid but may also represent dark matter .",
    "this line element makes physical sense only if @xmath77 ( even though our solution is mathematically correct for any @xmath56 ) , since it is normally viewed as a model for galactic rotation curves . here",
    "@xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the tangential velocity and @xmath32 is an ( arbitrary ) integration constant @xcite .",
    "according to ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath119 and remains approximately constant .",
    "we conclude that line element ( [ e : line5 ] ) can be arrived at by purely mathematical means , i.e. , given the einstein field equations and the eos @xmath0 , @xmath116 , we get an exact solution only if @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ e : red1 ] ) is a constant .",
    "the implication is that a constant tangential velocity could have been hypothesized based on the einstein field equations provided , of course , that a perfect - fluid background is assumed .",
    "the existence of a perfect fluid is a reasonable assumption that is also consistent with the existence of dark matter .",
    "in this paper we obtained the most general possible exact solution of the einstein field equations given a barotropic equation of state .",
    "this solution yields two different models .",
    "the condition @xmath22 in the anisotropic eos @xmath25 yields the most general possible model for wormholes supported by phantom energy , thereby generalizing several earlier results .",
    "the case @xmath116 in the eos @xmath0 yields the usual model for galactic rotation curves . here",
    "the eos represents a perfect fluid which may include dark matter .",
    "mathematicall speaking , we therefore have only one exact solution , but due to the parameter @xmath13 , this solution corresponds to completely different physical models .",
