    "general relativity will break down at very high energies in the early universe when quantum effects are expected to become important .",
    "if the very early universe is described by a period of inflation  @xcite , as in the current paradigm of cosmology , and if the period of inflation lasts sufficiently long ( as it does in most current scalar field - driven inflationary models ) , then , since the wavelength of perturbations which are observed today emerged from the planck region in the early stages of inflation , in principle the quantum theory of gravity should leave an imprint on the primordial spectrum of perturbations ( see  @xcite for the first discussion of this effect ; see  @xcite for a recent review containing a comprehensive list of references , and  @xcite for some of the latest papers on this issue ) .",
    "the nature of these imprints will remain an open question as long as we lack a complete theory of quantum gravity .",
    "if we assume that string theory is a promising framework for quantum gravity , it is of interest to explore specific stringy corrections to the spectrum of fluctuations .",
    "the standard concordance @xmath3cdm model , which can arise from an inflationary background cosmology in which the quasi - exponential expansion of space is driven by a scalar field , provides a good fit to the recent wmap  @xcite and earlier observations .",
    "this implies , in particular , that any stringy corrections to general relativity will be constrained by the properties of the observed cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies .",
    "although there is no signature in cmb data of statistically significant deviations from the predictions of the standard paradigm , the unexpectedly low quadrupole and octopole  @xcite are intriguing , in particular since a similar deficit of power on these large angular scales was also seen in the earlier cobe maps .",
    "thus , although the lack of power on the largest scales may simply be a statistical effect ( and different approaches to statistical analysis yield differing results concerning the statistical significance of the lack of power  @xcite ) , early universe explanations of this lack of power are not ruled out and are worth exploring , provided that the explanations are not ad hoc .",
    "recent papers  @xcite have attempted to explain the low quadrupole and octopole , typically via a finely - tuned inflationary potential or an ad hoc cut - off in the spectrum ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the earlier work about this suppression ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , supergravity inflation is shown to lead to a possible running of the power spectrum which tends to be blue on large scales . in ref .",
    "@xcite , some corrections to general relativity inflation motivated by brane - world scenarios ( correction terms in the friedmann equations and velocity - dependent potentials ) were studied , and it was shown that they may account for the suppression of power . here , we investigate consequences of a more basic stringy effect , namely the space - time uncertainty relation  @xcite [ uncrel ] t x_phys l_s^2 , where @xmath4 are the physical space - time coordinates and @xmath5 is the string scale . in  @xcite , it was shown that this principle may yield inflation from pure radiation .",
    "a more modest approach was pioneered in  @xcite , where the consequences were studied of imposing eq .",
    "( [ uncrel ] ) on the action for cosmological perturbations on an inflationary background ( generated in the usual way ) .",
    "space - time non - commutativity  @xcite at high energies in the early universe leads to a coupling between the fluctuations generated in inflation and the background friedmann model that is nonlocal in time .",
    "in addition , the uncertainty relation is saturated for a particular comoving wavelength when the corresponding physical wavelength is equal to the string length .",
    "thus , fluctuation modes must be considered to emerge at this time ( a time denoted by @xmath6 later in the text ) , and the most conservative assumption is to start the modes in the state which minimizes the canonical hamiltonian at that time . in a background space - time with power - law inflation , these modifications lead to a suppression of power for large - wavelength modes ( those created when the hubble constant is largest ) , compared to the predictions of standard general relativity inflation  @xcite",
    ". it may appear counter - intuitive that high - energy stringy effects modify the large - scale perturbations rather than those on small scales .",
    "but the point is that large - scale modes , which correspond to higher energies earlier in inflation , are created outside the hubble radius due to stringy effects , and thus experience less growth than the small - scale modes , which are created inside the hubble radius at lower energies , and evolve as in the standard case .",
    "there is a critical wavenumber @xmath7 such that for @xmath8 the mode is created on super - hubble scales , and thus undergoes less squeezing during the subsequent evolution than it does for @xmath9 .",
    "this critical wavenumber depends on the string scale and on the exponent @xmath1 appearing in the formula for the time - dependence of the scale factor [ see eq .",
    "( [ sfactor ] ) ] .",
    "the spectrum is blue - tilted for @xmath10 rather than red - tilted as it is in the power - law inflation scenario with @xmath9 .",
    "here we calculate the spectrum of cmb anisotropies predicted by the model of  @xcite , and thus quantify the prediction of loss of power for infrared modes .",
    "in addition , we perform a likelihood analysis to find the best - fit values to the wmap data of the cosmological parameters , including the power - law exponent @xmath1 which gives the time dependence of the scale factor , and the critical wavenumber @xmath0 ( to a first approximation the same as @xmath11 ) when stringy effects become important .",
    "thus we are able to constrain the non - commutative model and place limits on the string scale .",
    "these results expand on the previous work of  @xcite , where the parameters of the model of  @xcite were fitted to the wmap data at two specific angular scales .",
    "the stringy space - time uncertainty relation is compatible with an unchanged homogeneous background , but it leads to changes in the action for the metric fluctuations .",
    "the action for scalar metric fluctuations can be reduced to the action of a real scalar field @xmath12 with a specific time - dependent mass which depends on the background cosmology ( see e.g.  @xcite for a comprehensive review ) . for simplicity",
    ", we will assume that matter is described by a single real scalar field @xmath13 .",
