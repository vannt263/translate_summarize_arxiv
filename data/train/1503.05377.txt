    "spatial stochastic models for wireless communication networks have attracted much attention  ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is because the performance of a wireless network depends on the spatial configuration of wireless nodes and spatial point processes can capture the irregularity of the node configuration in a real network . in the analysis of such spatial models for wireless networks , the stationary poisson point processes  ( ppps )",
    "have widely used to model the configuration of wireless nodes .",
    "while such a ppp based model is tractable to analyze , it is an idealized one and ignores the spatial correlation among the wireless nodes .",
    "recently , spatial models based on determinantal point processes  ( dpps ) are studied as promising models for analysis of cellular wireless networks ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the dpps can express the repulsive nature among the macro base stations  ( bss ) observed in a real cellular network and have many desirable mathematical properties to analyze the network performance ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , almost all the prior works on the dpp based models assume the rayleigh fading while the ppp based models have been developed to allow arbitrary distributions of fading / shadowing propagation effects  ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there are only a few exceptions as follows : although @xcite mainly assume the rayleigh fading , it states in remark  2 that the fading from the interfering bss can be generalized to follow an arbitrary distribution while retaining the rayleigh fading from the serving bs .",
    "also , @xcite investigates the tail asymptotics of the distribution of interference using different fading distributions , though it does not take into account the fading from the serving bs .    in order for the dpp based model to be more promising , it is essential to extend it to allow non - rayleigh propagation effects from both the serving and interfering bss . in the present paper ,",
    "we propose the downlink cellular network model where the bss are deployed according to the ginibre point process  ( gpp ) over nakagami-@xmath0 fading  ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the gpp is one of the main examples of the dpps and is suited to model the macro bs configuration  ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the nakagami-@xmath0 fading includes the rayleigh one as a special case of @xmath1 and makes the fading effects to follow the @xmath0th erlang distribution with unit mean .",
    "it is further important to study the erlang distributed propagation effects since it could lead to an extension to the analysis of multi - input multi - output heterogeneous cellular networks as in @xcite . for the proposed model",
    ", we derive a numerically computable form of the coverage probability and reveal some properties of it numerically and theoretically .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section , the network model which we consider is defined , where the impact of the variability of fading effects on the signal - to - interference ratio  ( sir ) is discussed using some stochastic order . a brief description of the gpp is also provided . in section",
    "[ sec : coverage ] , we first give the basic formula of the downlink coverage probability when the bss are deployed according to a general stationary point process and then we derive a numerically computable form of it when the bss are deployed according to the gpp . in section  [ sec : asympt ] , the asymptotic properties of the downlink coverage probability in two extreme cases @xmath1 and @xmath2 are discussed .",
    "the results of some numerical experiments are shown in section  [ sec : experiments ] .",
    "the downlink cellular network model which we consider mainly follows the ones in  @xcite and consists of homogeneous macro bss .",
    "let @xmath3 denote a point process on @xmath4 and let @xmath5 , @xmath6 , denote the points of @xmath3 , where the order of @xmath7 , @xmath8 ,  , is arbitrary .",
    "the point process @xmath3 expresses the configuration of the bss and we refer to the bs located at @xmath5 as bs  @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that @xmath3 is simple and locally finite a.s .  and also stationary .",
    "each mobile user is associated with the closest bs .",
    "thus , due to the stationarity of the point process and the homogeneity of the bss , we can focus on a typical user located at the origin  @xmath10 . for the simplicity , we limit ourselves to the interference limited ( noise - free ) case throughout the paper . it is known that , in the interference limited case of the stationary single tier network model , the downlink coverage probability does not depend on the intensity of the point process , transmission power and path - loss coefficient ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , so that , we set these values as @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath12 , respectively , for convenience . the path - loss function @xmath13 representing the attenuation of signals with distance is then given by @xmath14 , @xmath15 , for some @xmath16 .",
    "we assume the nakagami-@xmath0 fading , so that the random propagation effect from the bs  @xmath9 to the typical user , denoted by @xmath17 , follows the @xmath0th erlang distribution with unit mean , denoted by @xmath18 , @xmath6 , where @xmath17 , @xmath6 , are mutually independent and also independent of the point process  @xmath3 .",
    "the shadowing is ignored in our model .    in this",
    "setting , the downlink sir of the typical user is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the index of the bs associated with the typical user at the origin ; that is , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , @xmath6 , denotes the cumulative interference received by the typical user from all the bss except bs  @xmath9 ; that is , @xmath23 when we emphasize the @xmath0 of the nakagami-@xmath0 fading , we put the superscript  @xmath24 and write @xmath25 , @xmath26 and so on .    before assigning a specific point process to the bs configuration  @xmath3 , we here discuss the variability of the sir in terms of the value of @xmath0 of the nakagami-@xmath0 fading using some stochastic order . for two random variables @xmath27 and @xmath28 with finite expectations , we say that @xmath27 is less than @xmath28 in the convex order [ resp .  increasing convex order ] and write @xmath29 [ resp .",

    "it is well known that @xmath33 is decreasing in @xmath0 in the convex order ; that is , @xmath34 implies @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "however , we have to care about the application of the convex or increasing convex order to the sir in   since it may not have the finite expectation when the path - loss function is unbounded at the origin .",
    "we thus consider the conditional sir given the common bs configuration  @xmath3 .",
