    "many physical and combinatorial problems associated with complex networks of interacting degrees of freedom can be mapped to equivalent problems of finding the ground ( or minimum cost ) state of a corresponding quantum hamiltonian @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "one of the approaches to finding the ground state of @xmath0 is adiabatic quantum computation which can be formulated as follows .",
    "consider the time dependent hamiltonian @xmath1 , where @xmath0 is the hamiltonian whose ground state is to be found , @xmath2 is the given time - interval of quantum computation , @xmath3 is an auxiliary  initial \" hamiltonian and @xmath4 \\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "as time varies from @xmath5 to @xmath6 , the hamiltonian interpolates between @xmath3 and @xmath0 .",
    "if the system is initially close to the ground state of @xmath3 , and if @xmath2 is sufficiently large ( slow variation ) , then the system will remain close to the instantaneous ground state ( i.e. , that of @xmath7 ) for all @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "in particular , at @xmath6 the ground state of the total hamiltonian , @xmath9 , will be close to the ground state of @xmath0 , which is the state we seek . in practice ,",
    "@xmath3 is chosen such that its ground state is known , then the dynamics is allowed to evolve and the state of the system evolves into the final state which is the solution to the problem .",
    "closely related to the adiabatic quantum computation is quantum annealing , in which one has a hamiltonian @xmath0 to be optimized , and an auxiliary ( non - commuting ) term @xmath3 so that the total hamiltonian reads @xmath10 , where @xmath11 reduces from very high value to zero during the evolution .",
    "the coefficient @xmath11 is the control parameter and initially @xmath12 kept very high so that @xmath3 dominates over @xmath0 .",
    "one starts with the ground state of @xmath3 as the initial state , and if @xmath11 is slowly decreasing , the adiabatic theorem guarantees reaching of the ground state of the main hamiltonian @xmath0 at the end of computation , assuming that there are no energy level crossings between the ground and excited states .",
    "quantum optimization algorithms usually require the presence of a gap between the ground state and first excited state , however , in typical cases the minimal gap , @xmath13 , is exponentially small .- qubit models , the estimate of the minimal energy gap is @xmath14 @xcite . ]",
    "this increases drastically the total computational time and from a practical point of view , the advantage of the method is lost .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a novel adiabatic non - hermitian quantum optimization algorithm .",
    "the non - hermitian hamiltonians naturally appear when a quantum system has both discrete ( intrinsic ) and continuous spectra , and one performs a projection of the total wave function on the discrete part of the spectrum @xcite . in this case , the corresponding intrinsic energy levels acquire the finite widths , which are associated with the transitions from the intrinsic states to the continuum",
    ". then the dynamics of the intrinsic states can be described by the schrdinger equation with an effective non - hermitian hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the adequate candidates for implementation of non - hermitian adiabatic quantum optimization algorithm can be , for example , superconducting phase qubits @xcite .",
    "we show that coupling the system to a non - hermitian auxiliary initial hamiltonian induces an effective level repulsion for the total hamiltonian .",
    "this effect enables us to develop an adiabatic theory without the usual gap restriction , and to determine much more efficiently the ground state of @xmath0 .",
    "the generic adiabatic quantum optimization problem may be formulated as follows @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be a hamiltonian whose ground state is to be found , and @xmath3 be the auxiliary `` initial '' hamiltonian .",
    "then we consider the following time -dependent hamiltonian : @xmath15 where @xmath4 \\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "the functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 are monotonic increasing and decreasing , respectively , and satisfy the following conditions : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , if @xmath21 . the hamiltonian @xmath22 , as @xmath23 , and we assume that , for any choice of the function @xmath16 , @xmath7 is dominated by @xmath3 at the initial time @xmath24 .    the evolution of the system is determined by the schrdinger equation @xmath25 we impose the initial conditions as follows : @xmath26 , where @xmath27 denotes the energy of the ground state @xmath28 , which is assumed to be the ground state of the auxiliary hamiltonian @xmath3 .",
    "the adiabatic theorem guarantees that the initial state @xmath29 evolves into the final state @xmath30 , which is the ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath0 as long as the instantaneous ground state of @xmath7 does not become degenerate at any time .",
    "the validity of the adiabatic theorem requires that the following condition be satisfied @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the ground instantaneous state related to the instantaneous eigenenegry @xmath33 .",
    "the condition ( [ qa2 ] ) is violated near the degeneracies in which the eigenvalues coalesce . in most common case of double degeneracy with two linearly independent eigenvectors ,",
    "the energy surfaces form the sheets of a double cone .",
    "the apex of the cones is called a `` diabolic point '' , and since , for a generic hermitian hamiltonian , the co - dimension of the diabolic point is three , it can be characterized by three parameters @xcite . moreover , in the vicinity of the degeneracy point , the @xmath34-dimensional problem effectively becomes a two - dimensional problem @xcite .",
    "this will be essential in the following argument .    for quantum optimization",
    "the commonly used version of the adiabatic theorem takes the form @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the ground instantaneous state and the first excited state of the total system , and `` dot '' denotes the derivative with respect to the dimensionless time @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "as can be observed , if during the evolution the gap @xmath40 becomes small enough , the amount of time required to pass from the initial state to the final state becomes very large and from the practical point of view the adiabatic quantum optimization loses its advantage compared with thermal annealing .",
    "since in the vicinity of the level crossing point only the two - dimensional jordan block related to the level crossing makes the most considerable contribution to the quantum evolution , the @xmath34-dimensional problem can be described by an effective two - dimensional hamiltonian which can be obtained as follows @xcite .",
    "let @xmath41 be the crossover point at which the energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state of the total hamiltonian @xmath42 achieves its minimum .",
    "in the two - dimensional subspace corresponding to @xmath43 and @xmath44 , we choose an orthonormal basis @xmath45 and complement it to the complete basis of the @xmath34-dimensional hilbert space by adding the eigenvectors @xmath46 @xmath47 .",
    "now , an arbitrary state @xmath48 can be expanded as @xmath49 ) , we obtain the coefficients , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , as the solution of the two - dimensional schrdinger equation @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 . the matrix elements in eq .",

    "( [ r1a ] )  ( [ r1b ] ) by substitution of @xmath0 and @xmath3 instead of @xmath9 .",

    "we obtain @xmath72 where we denote @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "this yields @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the minimum gap between the first two energy levels of the total hamiltonian @xmath7 .",
    "non - hermitian quantum optimization can be implemented by the following generalization of the hermitian adiabatic quantum optimization : @xmath79 where @xmath80 . the functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( being monotonic decreasing and increasing , respectively ) satisfy the following conditions : @xmath20 , if @xmath21 , and @xmath81 , @xmath19 .",
    "in addition , we assume that the function @xmath82 is monotonic and @xmath83 .    the evolution of the total system is determined by the schrdinger equation and its adjoint equation @xcite : @xmath84 we impose the initial conditions as follows : @xmath85 , @xmath27 being the energy of the ground state of the initial non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath86 .",
    "we denote by @xmath32 and @xmath87 the right / left instantaneous eigenvectors of the total hamiltonian : @xmath88 we assume that both systems of left and right eigenvectors form a bi - orthonormal basis , @xmath89 @xcite .    for the non - hermitian quantum optimization problem the criterion validity of adiabatic approximation",
    "can be written as @xcite @xmath90 this restriction is violated near the ground state degeneracy where the complex energy levels cross .",
    "the point of degeneracy is known as the exceptional point , and it is characterized by a coalescence of eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors , as well . therefore , studying the behavior of the system in the vicinity of the exceptional point requires special care @xcite .    at the crossover point , @xmath41",
    ", we introduce the bi - orthonormal basis as follows : in the two - dimensional subspace spanned by the ground state and the first excited state of the total non - hermitian hamiltonian , @xmath91 , we choose an orthonormal basis @xmath92 and complement it to the complete basis by adding the eigenvectors @xmath93 @xmath94 .",
    "then the set of states @xmath95 , where @xmath96 runs from 2 to @xmath97 , forms the bi - orthonormal basis of the @xmath34-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "basically repeating the same procedure as for the hermitian case , we obtain the effective two - dimensional non - hermitian hamiltonian as @xmath98 where @xmath99 , and @xmath66 and @xmath67 are defined in the same functional form as in eq .",
    "( [ eh1 ] ) , but in the new basis referred to the crossover point of the total non - hermitian hamiltonian , @xmath100 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath101 has a complex energy spectrum given by @xmath102 , where @xmath103 and we set @xmath68 , @xmath104 . from ( [ r1c ] )",
    "we obtain the energy gap as @xmath105 ) , ( [ r2 ] ) and below we do not indicate in some expressions the explicit dependences on t.    as can be seen , @xmath106 vanishes at the exceptional point , defined in the parameter space @xmath107 by @xmath108 .",
    "this yields @xmath109 .",
    "from here it follows that the complex energy does not become degenerate during the evolution of the system , if @xmath110 for any @xmath111 .",

    "the complex energy gap is controlled by the parameter @xmath117 , and , thus , the non - hermitian adiabatic optimization does not suffer from the typical exponentially small energy gap of the hermitian adiabatic optimization .    a rough estimate of the time required for the non - hermitian quantum optimization can be obtained applying the criterion of eq .",
    "( [ nqa3 ] ) to the effective hamiltonian @xmath101 .",
    "the estimation of the matrix element @xmath118 yields @xmath119 from here , with help of eq .",
    "( [ nqa3 ] ) and taking into account that for many qubits system @xmath120 , we obtain @xmath121    as an illustrative example , we consider the non - hermitian adiabatic quantum optimization algorithm realized by the following linear interpolation : @xmath122 and @xmath123 , where @xmath38 denotes dimensionless time .",
    "substituting @xmath124 and @xmath125 into eq .",
    "( [ r5 ] ) , we find that the energy gap , @xmath126 , is bounded from below by @xmath127 . at the critical point",

    "( see fig .",
    "[ naqc1 ] . ) applying the criterion of validity of the adiabatic approximation ( [ nqa3 ] ) , we find that the evolution time @xmath2 must satisfy the following condition : @xmath129 . from here , in the limit @xmath130 , we obtain @xmath131 .",
    "this inequality means that the time of passing the energy gap point becomes non - exponentially small when the number of qubits , @xmath132 , is big enough .",
    "there are two main reasons for this : ( i ) due to the non - hermitian part of the total hamiltonian , the energy gap is renormalized and becomes non - exponential , and ( ii ) at the same time , the matrix element in ( [ m1 ] ) of transition between the ground state and the first excited state still remains exponentially small .",
    "we should also mention that the non - hermitian part of the hamiltonian leads to the final life - time of qubits .",
    "so , the following inequality must be satisfied : @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the charcteristic width of the intrinsic energy level(s ) of the individual qubit",
    ". we should note that the relation between @xmath134 and @xmath135 will require a concretization of the quantum computer architecture in ( [ nqa4 ] ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated that our adiabatic quantum optimization algorithm , based on the use of non - hermitian hamiltonians , can significantly reduce the time needed for optimization of complex combinatorial problems .",
    "the main ideas of our approach are the following .",
    "one uses as an individual qubit a two level system which has simultaneously the discrete ( intrinsic ) states and a continuous part of the spectrum .",
    "so , the feshbach projection on the intrinsic states results in the finite widths , @xmath134 , for of the intrinsic states , which characterize the strength of the interaction of a qubit with a continuum .",
    "this interaction should not be too strong , as it characterizes the life - time of a qubit , @xmath136 .",
    "on the other hand , the parameter , @xmath135 , which characterizes the non - hermitian part of the total hamiltonian is responsible for the renormalization of the energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state .",
    "then , the energy gap becomes non - exponential , but the matrix element which is responsible for a transition between the ground state and the first excited state still remains exponentially small .",
    "all these factors , taken together , result in the improving of the adiabatic condition , if the number of qubits is big enough",
    ". the possible candidates for implementation of this approach could be , for example , the superconducting phase qubits @xcite which are effectively used in recent experiments on quantum computation . in order to establish the explicit relation between the parameters @xmath134 and @xmath135",
