    "a _ quandle _ is an algebraic structure whose axioms are transcriptions of the three reidemeister moves , making quandles a natural source of invariants of knots and links . in @xcite , joyce associated a finitely generated quandle to each tame knot or link @xmath0 and proved that this knot quandle determines the knot type up to orientation - reversing homeomorphism of pairs @xmath1 .",
    "since then , much work has been done in the study of knot invariants defined in terms of the knot quandle , such as @xcite , @xcite , etc .",
    "in particular , for any finite quandle @xmath2 there are invariants of knots and links defined in terms of the set @xmath3 of quandle homomorphisms from the knot quandle @xmath4 into a finite target quandle @xmath2 .",
    "since isomorphic target quandles @xmath2 and @xmath5 define the same invariants , we would like to have a convenient way of distinguishing finite quandles .",
    "moreover , understanding the structure of these finite quandles can lead to a better understanding of their link invariants .    in this paper",
    "we describe a two - variable polynomial invariant of finite quandles .",
    "this polynomial encodes a set with multiplicities arising from counting trivial actions of elements on other elements ; the polynomial is a convenient way to encode this information with the added benefit of obtaining integer - valued invariants via specialization of @xmath6 and @xmath7 . while not a complete invariant , this polynomial does seem to be quite good at distinguishing finite quandles",
    "indeed , in some cases the invariant completely determines the structure of the quandle .",
    "one motivation for this construction comes from consideration of the nature of identity elements and kernels of homomorphisms .",
    "specifically , groups have a unique identity element which acts trivially on the rest of the group , and the preimage of this element under a homomorphism measures how much information about the domain group is lost in the homomorphism . unlike groups , quandles do not have a unique identity element ; rather , every element in a quandle acts trivially on itself and possibly some other elements .",
    "we might say that in a group , the `` trivial action '' is concentrated in a single element , while in a quandle it is distributed throughout the set .",
    "our polynomial may then be understood as a way of quantifying how this `` trivial action '' is distributed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we recall the definition of a quandle and some examples of quandles .",
    "we then define the @xmath8 polynomial and list some examples . in section 3",
    ", we define a generalization of @xmath8 for subquandles of a larger quandle and a @xmath8-based laurent polynomial associated to a homomorphism between finite quandles .",
    "we the use @xmath8 to define a family of link invariants which are jazzed - up versions of the familiar quandle counting invariant . in section 4",
    ", we list some questions for future research and end with a table listing the @xmath8 values for all quandles with order up to 5 .",
    "we begin with a definition from joyce , @xcite .",
    "the axioms can be understood as transcriptions of the three reidemeister moves where each arc in the knot diagram corresponds to a quandle element and the quandle operation corresponds to an arc going through a crossing .",
    "some well - known examples of quandles include :    @xmath9    @xmath10    let @xmath11 be a finite quandle .",
    "we can describe the algebraic structure of @xmath12 with an @xmath13 matrix @xmath14 satisfying @xmath15=k$ ] where @xmath16 .",
    "in other words , the matrix of @xmath12 is just the quandle operation table without the `` @xmath17 ' 's .",
    "this quandle matrix notation is convenient for symbolic computation purposes @xcite , @xcite .    [ qp ] @xmath18    that is",
    ", @xmath19 is the number of elements of @xmath12 which act trivially on @xmath17 , while @xmath20 is the number of elements of @xmath12 on which @xmath17 acts trivially .",
    "these numbers are easily computed from the matrix of @xmath12 , simply by going through rows and columns and counting occurrences of the row number .",
    "note that if @xmath12 has infinite cardinality , then @xmath20 and @xmath19 may not be finite and @xmath21 may not be defined .",
    "[ iso ] if @xmath12 and @xmath22 are isomorphic finite quandles , then @xmath23 .",
    "suppose @xmath24 is an isomorphism of quandles and fix @xmath25 .",
    "then for every @xmath26 , we have @xmath27 , so @xmath28 and we have @xmath29 . repeating the same argument with @xmath30 yields the opposite inequality , and we have @xmath31 .",
    "a similar argument shows that @xmath32 .",
    "then we have @xmath33    @xmath34 \\quad \\mathrm{and } \\quad qp_{t_n}(s , t ) = ns^nt^n.\\ ] ]    evaluating @xmath35 yields @xmath36 , the cardinality of @xmath12",
    ".    @xmath37    thus , we may regard @xmath21 as a kind of enhanced version of cardinality for finite quandles .",
    "it s easy to see that @xmath21 completely determines the quandle structure for some quandles , such as @xmath38 above .",
    "in fact , @xmath8 distinguishes all quandles of order 3 and 4 and all non - latin quandles of order 5 , as shown in table 1 .",
    "there are examples of non - isomorphic quandles with the same @xmath8 values , as the next example shows .",
    "the @xmath8 polynomial distinguishes between some quandles which have the same orbit decomposition but different structure maps ( see @xcite ) .",

    "then there is a column @xmath47 with @xmath15=i$ ] .",
    "but then row @xmath43 is not a permutation of @xmath48 , contradicting the fact that @xmath12 is latin .",
    "hence , we must have @xmath49 .    similarly , if @xmath50 then there is some @xmath47 such that @xmath51=j$ ] , and then we have @xmath52 , contradicting our conclusion above .",
    "hence @xmath53 .",
    "since @xmath43 was arbitrary , we have @xmath54    direct computations show that the converse of proposition [ lat ] has no counterexamples with cardinality less than 7 .",
    "thus we have :    every quandle @xmath12 with @xmath55 is latin .",
    "we may also define the @xmath8 invariant for non - quandle racks ; such racks may have @xmath56 , as in the next example .",
    "@xmath57 @xmath58    indeed , if @xmath59 for a rack @xmath60 , then @xmath60 is not a quandle .",
    "in this section we define a generalization of @xmath21 which gives information about how a subquandle is embedded in a larger quandle and we use this to define a family of link invariants .",
    "@xmath61    if a finite quandle @xmath62 is a disjoint union of several subquandles ( e.g. , the orbit subquandles ) then we have @xmath63    @xmath64    [ ker ] if @xmath24 is injective , then every exponent in @xmath65 is nonnegative ; if @xmath66 is surjective , then every exponent in @xmath65 is nonpositive . if @xmath66 is an isomorphism , then @xmath67 .",
    "this is similar to the proof of proposition [ iso ] .",
    "thus , @xmath65 has a philosophical similarity to the kernel of a homomorphism .",
    "note , however , that the converse of proposition [ ker ] is not true , as the next example shows .",
    "recall that for any knot or link @xmath68 , there is an associated _ knot quandle _ @xmath4 , and that for a given finite quandle @xmath2 the set of quandle homomorphisms @xmath69 is a source of computable knot invariants .",
    "specifically , we can take the cardinality of the set , which gives us an integer - valued invariant .",
    "alternatively , we can count the homomorphisms weighted by a cocycle in one of the various quandle cohomology theories ( described in @xcite , @xcite etc . )",
    "; these cocycles provide a way of squeezing extra information out of the set of homomorphisms .",
    "we can use the subquandle polynomials of the image of each homomorphism in a similar way .",
    "@xmath70    normally , we encode sets with multiplicities whose elements are integers as polynomials where the multiplicities appear as coefficients and the elements of the set are powers of a variable ; in this case , however , the elements of the set are already polynomials , and polynomials with polynomial powers seem a little awkward",
    ". however , we can derive convenient polynomial - valued specializations of @xmath71 by choosing values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 in @xmath72 and evaluating .",
