    "fcn couplings between light quarks are experimentally constrained to be very small , but this is not the case for the top quark .",
    "actually , top fcn vertices can mediate the decays @xmath14 and @xmath3 , giving observable rates in models with up - type singlets @xcite .",
    "the largest branching ratios allowed by present experimental data are @xmath15 , @xmath16 @xcite , much smaller than present direct limits @xmath17 @xcite but still observable at lhc @xcite and tesla @xcite . in this letter",
    "we investigate the enhancement of the branching ratios for the two other fcn decays , @xmath0 and @xmath18 , in the presence of either up or down singlets .",
    "we find the rates of these processes allowed by present experimental constraints , and study how the gim suppression takes place in these models .",
    "for completeness we also quote without discussion the results for @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which in the sm are suppressed by the ratio @xmath21 with respect to the former , but in these sm extensions can have the same magnitude .",

    "a similar structure is valid for @xmath18 , with form factors @xmath55 and @xmath56 . in order to compute the amplitude the form factors are written in terms of passarino - veltman integrals @xcite using form @xcite .",

    ", there is a new term with a larger function @xmath74 ( for @xmath75 gev ) , which is however suppressed by @xmath66 .",
    "the parameter @xmath66 can be related to the breaking of the column unitarity of @xmath70 .",
    "this is easily understood , because if the columns of this submatrix are orthogonal , so must be the rows .",
    "the explicit relation can be written using the extension of the wolfenstein parameterisation @xcite in ref .",

    "the fcn coupling @xmath93 can be @xmath94 for @xmath95 @xcite , yielding a branching ratio @xmath96 .",
    "we note that the larger branching ratio achieved in model i is _ not _ a consequence of the presence of a tree - level coupling @xmath97 , which appears in the expressions of the form factors on the same footing as the parameter @xmath66 . moreover , the loop integrals of the new physics contributions of model i , @xmath92 and of model @xmath45 , @xmath74 , are very similar . the only reason for the larger branching ratio in model i is that @xmath98 , that is , unitarity of @xmath70 can be broken to a lesser extent in model @xmath45 due to the strong requirements on fcn couplings between light quarks .",
    "additionally , @xmath99 can be smaller in model i , and the total top width is reduced .",
    "we are also interested in the cp asymmetry @xmath100 this interest is mainly academic , because if the branching ratios are unobservable , even less are the asymmetries .",

    "the cp asymmetry @xmath101 is proportional to the imaginary part of the rephasing - invariant quartet @xmath107 .",
    "this is expected from general grounds .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that in a model with an extra down singlet _ all _ cp violating observables at high energy ( that is , when @xmath108 compared to the scale of energy involved ) must be proportional to @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , or a combination of them @xcite .",
    "the sm limit is recovered setting @xmath71 , obtaining a vanishing cp asymmetry .",
    "it is well known that cp asymmetries at high energy are very small in the sm @xcite , due to : ( _ i _ ) the smallness of @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 , what leads to a more efficient gim cancellation ; ( _ ii _ ) the small mixing between the top and the first two generations . when all the quark masses are kept in the computation a non - vanishing but a negligible asymmetry @xmath115 is obtained . for the gluon case ,",
    "the asymmetry @xmath116 is also extremely small .",
    "3 .   since cpt invariance requires that the total width of the top and the antitop are equal , the different partial widths @xmath117 must be compensated in other channel . in this case",
    ", the compensating decay channels are the sm leading modes @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 and their conjugate processes @xcite .",
    "the large phases in the functions @xmath121 , @xmath122 allow to obtain relatively large cp asymmetries , provided @xmath123 is sizeable .",
    "we explore the parameter space of models i and @xmath45 to find the maximum values of @xmath124 and @xmath125 allowed by present experimental measurements .",
    "the constraints on these models come from precision electroweak data , @xmath126 and @xmath59 physics and atomic parity violation ( the details of the analysis can be found in ref .",
    "we take all the quark masses into account , and require that the mass of the new quark is larger than 200 gev to satisfy the limits from direct searches . in model",
    "i , assuming that the new quark has a mass @xmath127 gev , we find the maximum rates @xmath128 corresponding to @xmath129 , @xmath130 .",
    "( the branching ratios scale with @xmath131 approximately . ) for larger @xmath132 , the allowed values of @xmath133 are smaller @xcite , and these branching ratios decrease",
    ". the cp asymmetries corresponding to the figures in eqs .",
    "( [ ec:22 ] ) are negligible , @xmath134 because the rates are dominated by the @xmath93 term .",
    "the asymmetries can have values in the range @xmath135 , @xmath136 , but only reach the boundaries of these intervals for branching ratios much smaller than those in eqs .",
    "( [ ec:22 ] ) .",
    "the results for decays to up quarks are a little larger , @xmath137 in model @xmath45 , assuming that the mass of the new quark is @xmath75 gev , we have @xmath138 these numbers are almost insensitive to the mass of the new @xmath4 quark for @xmath139 gev , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , and show a small increase with @xmath140 .",
    "the corresponding asymmetries are @xmath141 in general , the cp asymmetries take values in the intervals @xmath142 , @xmath143 . the decay rates",
    "to up quarks are larger , @xmath144    the branching ratios in eqs .",
    "( [ ec:22][ec:24b ] ) are too small to be measurable in the near future .",
    "the estimated @xmath145 sensitivities of lhc to these decays are @xmath146 @xcite , @xmath147 @xcite , @xmath148 and @xmath149 @xcite , with an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath150 .",
    "the tesla sensitivity to @xmath151 is better but not enough , @xmath152 @xcite with a centre of mass energy of 800 gev and a luminosity of 500 fb@xmath150 .",
    "hence , we observe that in models with up - type singlets the rates for @xmath153 , @xmath154 can be observable but not the rates for @xmath155 and @xmath156 , which are four and three orders of magnitude smaller , respectively .",
    "this fact contrasts with the results for two higgs doublet models or supersymmetric extensions of the sm , where the branching ratios for @xmath157 and @xmath158 are similar , and the branching ratio for @xmath1 is one order of magnitude larger .",
