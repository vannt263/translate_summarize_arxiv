    "the primordial ratio of the number of deuterium to hydrogen nuclei ( d / h ) created in big bang nucleosynthesis is the most sensitive measure of the cosmological baryon - to - photon ratio , @xmath3 , and the cosmological density of baryons , @xmath4 . in the interstellar medium of our galaxy d / h = @xmath5 ( linsky  1995 ) , which places a strict lower limit on the primordial abundance , because stars reduce the proportion of d in the ism . on the other hand",
    ", quasar absorption line systems should provide suitable targets to determine primordial d abundances because they can sample metal - poor gas at early epochs where the destruction of d should be negligible .",
    "carswell  ( 1994 ) and songaila  ( 1994 ) obtained a high d / h @xmath6 @xmath7 ratio from a possible deuterium absorption feature toward the quasar q0014 + 813 .",
    "more recent observations by rugers & hogan ( 1996 ) and tytler  ( 1996 ) do not provide clear evidence in favor or against high d / h ratios at large redshifts and it is still difficult to rule out entirely the possibility that the d feature is contaminated by h having a velocity different from that of the principal hydrogen lines .",
    "therefore , a direct measurement of atomic deuterium toward high redshift quasars is a potentially powerful , though not yet fully explored means of studying d / h .",
    "irrespective of the validity of a high or low cosmological d / h value , the ratio appears to be small enough to preclude any easy detection of deuterated molecular species in interstellar space .",
    "nevertheless , the zero - point energy difference between hydrogen- and deuterium - bearing molecules means that deuterated species can become heavily fractionated in cool environments .",
    "models of fractionation ( brown & rice 1986 ; millar  1989 ) indicate that the underlying d / h ratio is consistent with that suggested by linsky  ( 1995 ) , implying that the baryon mass density is not large enough to close the universe",
    ". hence measurements of deuterated species have become an important tool to study the physical properties and the chemical and dynamical history of galactic molecular clouds (  wootten 1987 ; millar  1989 ) . in a previous study mauersberger  ( 1995 )",
    "presented sensitive upper limits to the dcn / hcn ratio in ngc253 and ic342 , which are consistent with the warm , metal rich environment of this starburst nucleus .",
    "the data were taken in january and march 1996 , using the 15-m swedish - eso submillimetre telescope ( sest ) at la silla , chile .",
    "two sis receivers , one at @xmath8  = 3 and one at 2 mm , yielded overall system temperatures , including sky noise , of order  = 250k on a main beam brightness temperature ( ) scale .",
    "the backend was an acousto - optical spectrometer which was split into 2 @xmath9 1000 contiguous channels for simultaneous 3 and 2 mm observations .",
    "the channel separation of 43khz corresponds to 0.09 and 0.15  at 145 and 88ghz , respectively .",
    "the corresponding antenna beamwidths were 35  and 55  at the observed line frequencies taken from lovas ( 1992 ) .",
    "the observations were carried out in a dual beam - switching mode ( switching frequency 6hz ) with a beam throw of 1140  in azimuth .",
    "the on - source integration time of each spectrum varied from 8 minutes for  to 18 hours for  toward n113 .",
    "all spectral intensities obtained were converted to a  scale , correcting for main beam efficiencies of 0.74 at 85100 and 0.67 at 130150ghz ( dr .",

    "the ratio @xmath13(hx ) is defined as the abundance ratio of hx to dx , and is tabulated for hx @xmath14 ,  and hcn",
    "the detection of  and dcn in the lmc is a useful tool to study d / h on a larger spatial scale and in a less ` chemically ' processed environment than that provided by the galaxy .",
    "gensheimer  ( 1996 ) observed a high deuteration of water toward a number of galactic hot cores despite a high kinetic temperature .",
    "while this can be explained in terms of a recent evaporation of grain mantles , this effect probably plays no role toward our lmc sample since we are looking on a much larger region which may much better reflect the average conditions of the interstellar gas than the highly biassed sample by gensheimer  ( 1996 ) . due to the lower metallicity in the lmc",
    ", we expect grain surface reactions to be of lesser importance than for the galactic interstellar medium .",
    "the process of chemical fractionation has , however , to be accounted for quantitatively .",
    "to this end , we have re - visited earlier models of deuterium chemistry ( millar  1989 ; howe & millar 1992 ) with conditions appropriate for clouds in the lmc ( paper i ) and with an elemental d to h ratio of @xmath1 .",
    "we have updated the chemistry to include the fast dissociative recombination of  ( and ) and more accurate rate coefficients for neutral - neutral reactions . although the general trends of fractionation can be understood , especially for simple species like detailed models are necessary for quantitative comparison with the observations ( millar  1989 ) .    because deuterium fractionation depends on small differences in zero - point energies ,",
    "the process is sensitive to the kinetic temperature , , of the molecular gas .",
    "multi - transition studies of co in n113 have not been made so that  is unknown , but a value of around 20k is expected since the cloud is associated with an  region ( for detailed modelling , see lequeux  1994 ) . to cover the range of possibilities , we present the results of time - dependent chemical kinetic calculations at 10 , 20 and 30k for three model times in table[tbl : mc2-model ] .    at low temperatures",
    "there are two main routes to d fractionation : @xmath15 where we have calculated the rate coefficient , @xmath16 , for the back reaction of  with using the data presented by sidhu  ( 1992 ) .",
    "this rate coefficient is very sensitive to temperature and has values of @xmath17 and @xmath18  at 10 , 20 and 30k , respectively . for @xmath19 25k ,",
    "the back reaction is fast and @xmath13 ( ) is large , @xmath6 165 at 30k .  is formed through reactions involving and d atoms , with these species contributing 64%(36% ) at 10k , 54%(46% ) at 20k and 44%(56% ) at 30k , to the formation rate of .",
    "our results show that the deuterium fractionation is larger than that observed in n113 for  and hcn for @xmath20 20k and smaller for @xmath21 @xmath14 30k ; the observed result that fractionation is larger in  than dcn is reproduced .",
    "our results are consistent with @xmath22 20k for a d / h ratio of 1.5 @xmath9 10@xmath23 .",
    "however , the temperatures of the lmc clouds are not , as yet , well constrained .",
    "the observed abundance ratios could be reproduced in warmer clouds if the d / h ratio is larger than our adopted value . at a cloud temperature of 30k , one would need a d / h ratio about 10 times larger ,  on the order of @xmath24 . if there temperature is 2030k as suggested by lequeux  ( 1994 ) for the cloud cores ( for hcn , see also chin  1996 ) , then it appears that the d / h ratio in the lmc is similar to or larger than that in our galaxy .",
    "this would be consistent with the lmc gas being less processed through stars than that in our galaxy .",
    "thus , the evidence from the lmc is consistent with an open universe as long as the cosmological constant is small .",
