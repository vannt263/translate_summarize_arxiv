    "the presence of competing interactions and multiple electronic instabilities often leads to emergent phenomena and new phases .",

    "meanwhile upon applying pressure to the heavy fermion superconductor cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 @xcite , evidence was found for superconductivity being in close proximity to multiple instabilities , with one superconducting dome in the vicinity of magnetic order and another near a possible valence instability @xcite .",
    "the interplay between charge - density - wave ( cdw ) order and superconductivity has also been of particular interest recently @xcite , mainly due to the coexistence of these competing phases in some systems , with a similar phase diagram to systems with sdw and superconductivity @xcite , as well as the observation of cdw in the high temperature cuprate superconductors . in the cuprates ,",
    "the role of cdw order in the formation of superconductivity remains a central and open issue @xcite , but the microscopic relationship is still unresolved .",
    "+    structural distortions have also been found to occur in various iron based superconductors @xcite .",
    "for instance , upon lowering the temperature of electron doped bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 , the symmetry of the crystal lattice is reduced from the four - fold symmetry of the thcr@xmath0si@xmath0 structure , to a two fold symmetric orthorhombic structure , while sdw ordering onsets at lower temperatures @xcite .",
    "there is an increasing body of evidence that this distortion does not arise due to phonons @xcite , but is from an electronic instablity , the nematic order , which may be driven by either spin or orbital / charge fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the suppression of both the nematicity and sdw ordering in the region of the superconducting dome , again indicates the importance of understanding the relationship between the various ordered phases and underlying interactions .",
    "on the other hand , there also exist some non - iron based 122 pnictide superconductors @xmath3 ( @xmath4ba or sr , @xmath5transition metal and @xmath6pnictogen ) which undergo structural distortions upon cooling @xcite . a comparison with the iron based materials may provide crucial insights into the roles of various interactions and the resulting collective phenomena .",

    "similarly in the newly discovered bapt@xmath0as@xmath0 with a resistive transition at @xmath2  =  1.67  k @xcite , a first order phase transition appears at about 275  k , at which a structural phase transition from the tetragonal cabe@xmath0ge@xmath0-type structure to an orthorhombic structure was found using powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) @xcite . in this article",
    ", we demonstrate using single crystal xrd measurements that a cdw state already exists at room temperature in bapt@xmath0as@xmath0 and the structural transition at @xmath16 k corresponds to a change in the cdw superlattice .",
    "to study the relationship between superconductivity and the cdw state , we performed resistivity measurements under pressure , which reveal a rich temperature - pressure phase diagram with multiple pressure - induced transitions , the emergence of which are correlated with sudden changes in @xmath2 .",

    "measurements were performed using a physical property measurement system ( quantum design ppms-14 t ) in the temperature range of 2 k to 300 k , while measurements from 0.3  k to 5  k were performed using a @xmath17he refrigerator .",

    "these results indicate that even at room temperature , the cdw modulations induce a small difference in @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which becomes larger below 280  k. subsequent analysis of the data at 300  k reveals peaks corresponding to 2@xmath282@xmath282 superlattice structure , where the unit cell is doubled in all directions , along with an incommensurate modulation @xmath29 .",
    "reflections which are forbidden for the cabe@xmath0ge@xmath0-type structure such as @xmath30 and @xmath31 and the half fractional peaks such as @xmath32 arise from the 2@xmath282@xmath282 superlattice structure while the peaks at the position of @xmath33 around the superlattice peaks arise from the incommensurate modulation .",

    "the superconducting transition at 17  kbar is significantly broader than that at both lower and higher pressures , which may be due to a pressure inhomogeneity , leading to the coexistence of both superconducting phases .",

    "the critical pressure for the emergence of @xmath9 and @xmath10 is slighty lower than that corresponding to the jump in @xmath2 .",
    "this may be due to the variation in the pressure transmitted by the daphne  7373 medium with temperature , which can cause a pressure increase of around 1 - 2  kbar between 300  k and low temperatures @xcite .",

    "however , in bapt@xmath0as@xmath0 at ambient pressure the orthorhombic distortion and cdw modulation already exist above @xmath7 and this transition corresponds to a change of the periodicity of the superlattice . furthermore , there is a sudden increase in the resistivity at @xmath7 as in the case of the structural transition in srni@xmath0p@xmath0 @xcite , whereas there is a drop in the resistivity at @xmath15 in srpt@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "however , the behaviour of bapt@xmath0as@xmath0 above 22  kbar more strongly resembles that of srpt@xmath0as@xmath0 , since we observe a drop in the resistivity at @xmath10 and there is a comparable value of @xmath2 .",
    "if then the transition under pressure at @xmath10 is similar to that of srpt@xmath0as@xmath0 at ambient pressure , the differences in the cdw modulation and high temperature crystal structures may explain the different behavior of the resistivity seen at @xmath7 and @xmath10 .",
    "this suggests the possibility that the cdw state below @xmath7 disappears at @xmath48 , above which only a weak anomaly at @xmath8 is observed .",
    "furthermore , it is not clear whether the cdw state observed at ambient pressure and room temperature persists upon the application of pressure and it may be that the transition at @xmath8 lies beneath a cdw transition at higher temperatures . at @xmath54",
    "a different cdw state may emerge .",
    "however , while cdw states generally compete with superconductivity , in this instance the emergence of the transition at @xmath10 leads to a significant enhancement of @xmath2 , rather than a decrease .",
    "the dramatic change in both @xmath43 and the @xmath51 coefficient at @xmath54 suggests this may correspond to a sudden change in the electronic structure and fermi surface topology .",
    "such changes may lead to an enhanced density of states , which in turn may cause the significant increase of @xmath2 and @xmath51 .",
    "the transition at @xmath9 , which appears under @xmath10 up to around 19  kbar , may then correspond to a further lowering of the crystal symmetry or a change in the modulation vector * q * of the cdw state . a change of * q * can lead to different behavior of the resistivity since this changes the reconstructed fermi surface , with the cdw gap opening across different regions .",
    "however for these scenarios , it would be unusual that there is little change in @xmath2 upon the disappearance of @xmath9 .",
    "as previously discussed , at ambient pressure there is a structural distortion at @xmath7 corresponding to a significantly increased orthorhombicity .",
    "since both @xmath9 and @xmath10 have a similar first order nature , whether these transitions correspond to changes in either the crystal symmetry or structural parameters needs to be checked with xrd measurements under pressure .",
    "all these results suggest the presence of both structural and electronic instabilities in the temperature - pressure phase diagram . in light of the recent evidence that the nematic order in the iron pnictide based superconductors is driven by electronic rather than structural instabilities @xcite , it will be of interest to determine whether any of the transitions or structural changes in bapt@xmath0as@xmath0 also have an electronic origin .",
    "the relationship between the high temperature transitions and the superconductivity also needs to be further investigated and compared to both the cuprate and iron based materials , but the significantly lower values of @xmath2 may be a result of the lack of a spin fluctuation mediated pairing mechanism .    in conclusion , using single crystal xrd measurements we have identified that a cdw state exists in bapt@xmath0as@xmath0 in ambient conditions , and that the transition at @xmath56  k corresponds to a change of the superlattice structure .",
    "the application of pressure results in a rich phase diagram .",
    "pressure suppresses the cdw transition at @xmath7 until it disappears at around @xmath48  =  7  kbar , which leads to an enhancement of @xmath2 . upon further increasing the pressure ,",
    "new high temperature transitions are observed in the resistivity , which are correlated with an additional increase of @xmath2 .",
    "since these results indicate the presence of multiple instabilities at high temperatures , bapt@xmath0as@xmath0 may provide a platform for studying the competition between different interactions and their interplay with superconductivity .",
    "further experiments such as nmr and xrd under pressure , as well as theoretical calculations are needed to characterize the origin of these transitions and elucidate the mechanisms which lead to these exotic behaviors .",
