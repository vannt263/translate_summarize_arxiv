    "during evolution , a protein s amino acid sequence is altered by the insertion and deletion of residues and by the replacement of one residue by another . in principle , the alignment of proteins sequences and the subsequent detection of protein homologs and the inference of protein phylogenies requires a dynamical model of this sequence evolution .",
    "the most common and widely used residue replacement dynamics is the standard dayhoff model , which assumes that the substitution probability during some time interval depends only on the identities of the initial and replacement residues and that the dynamics is otherwise homogeneous along the protein chain , and between protein families , and across evolutionary epochs . in other words , under this model the dynamics of amino acid substitution resembles a continuous time , first order markov chain @xcite .",
    "however , it has long been known that this widely used markovian substitution model is fundamentally unsatisfactory .",
    "one major problem is that the short and long time substitution dynamics are incompatible @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggests that this is because at short evolutionary times the patterns of substitution are influenced by single base mutations between neighboring codons , whereas for more diverged sequences the genetic code is irrelevant and the patterns of replacement are dominated by the selection of chemically and structural compatible residues .",
    "a more serious problem with the dayhoff markovian model is that it assumes that every residue in every protein has the same background distribution of amino acids and that protein sequences rapidly evolve to this uninteresting equilibrium .",
    "in actuality , the amino acid background distribution varies markedly from one residue position to the next , as can be seen , by example , in figure  [ cap ] .",
    "these large site - to - site variations are stable across relatively long evolutionary time - scales , and they account for the success of protein hidden markov models and other profile based multiple sequence alignment methods .",
    "( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) profile methods can detect substantially more remote homologies than pairwise alignment ( * ? ? ?",
    "* green and brenner , unpublished data ) . in short ,",
    "the dynamics of amino acid substitution are not markovian , stationary , nor homogeneous , and the prediction of rapidly decaying sequence correlations is at odds with the success of profile based remote homology detection .",
    "a natural solution to the limitations of the markov model is to assume that residue replacement is governed by different markov processes for each position , each process potentially possessing its own background distribution and substitution probabilities .",
    "the appropriate markov matrix for a particular protein position is chosen based upon predictions of the protein structure , or directly from the sequence data .",
    "@xcite however , this approach is both computationally and conceptually complex .        )",
    "we can be reasonably confident that additional homologous residues will also be hydrophilic . ]    here , we propose that the observed sequence correlation between diverged homologs is principally due to the heterogeneous , stable , background distribution of each protein site and , therefore , that a markovian amino acid replacement dynamics is overly complicated and possible unnecessary for the accurate construction of protein sequence alignments and phylogenies . as an alternative , we construct a dynamical model of amino acid replacement that explicitly assumes that each protein site has a different equilibrium distribution of the 20 canonical amino acids ( which we refer to as that site s amino acid background , @xmath0 ) and that the residue distribution of each site rapidly ( relative to evolutionary time scales ) relaxes to this local , site - specific equilibrium .",
    "these distributions themselves conform to a probability distribution of backgrounds , @xmath1 , which we may discover by studying many families of homologous proteins ( see fig .",
    "[ dirichlet ] ) . we do not need to model the short time dynamics with any great accuracy , since the alignment of highly conserved homologs is relatively straightforward .",
    "therefore , we will assume that replacement residues are randomly sampled from the background distribution of that site .",
    "consequentially , ( and in direct contrast to the markov model ) the replacement residue is conditionally independent of the initial amino acid at all times .",
    "note that multiple substitutions are statistically equivalent to a single substitution ( since a single mutation is sufficient to relax a site to local equilibrium ) and that a residue can be replaced by the same amino acid type .",
    "the resulting dynamic is a site specific , continuous time , zeroth order markov chain , similar in spirit to felsenstein s ( 1981 ) model of nucleic acid substitution .",
    "the crucial difference is that the initial and replacement residues are non - trivially correlated because both have been sampled from the same background distribution , whereas non - homologous residues are drawn from different backgrounds .",
    "bruno has used essentially the same dynamical model discussed here , albeit without incorporating the background prior distribution , to find maximum likelihood estimates of site - specific amino acid frequencies @xcite .    under our residue replacement model ,",
    "the principle origin of sequence correlation between diverged homologs is the background distribution of each protein site .",
    "this is also the central idea underlying profile based multiple sequence alignment algorithms .",
    "therefore , we are not proposing a radically different method for homolog detection or sequence alignment ; rather we are proposing a concrete and consistent dynamics for the underlying evolutionary process .",
    "the implications of this dynamics can be readily extended to cover not only profile - sequence based alignment , but also profile - profile and pairwise sequence - sequence alignment . moreover , when we consider pairwise , sequence alignment below , we find that our model is essentially equivalent to the standard pairwise alignment methods , as they are used in practice .",
    "this alternative dynamical model of amino acid replacement is biologically reasonable , conceptually straightforward and can adequately explain many of the observed patterns of homolog sequence correlation without invoking a markovian dynamic .    , a conventional description of amino acid replacement propensities ) has been directly constructed from the dist.20comp dirichlet mixture model of amino acid background probabilities ( fig .  2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , using the conditionally independent substitution model of amino acid replacement ( eqs .",
    "3 - 10 ) . as a consequence of the heterogeneity and stability of amino acid background probabilities  illustrated in figs .",
    "[ cap ] and  [ dirichlet ]  the amino acid identity of a pair of alignable , homologous residues is non - trivially correlated over long evolutionary time scales , simply because both residues are drawn from the same background .",
    "scores are in units of @xmath2 bits , rounded to the nearest integer . ]    . finally , over a second , much longer time scale the sequence correlations decay towards insignificance due to changes in the site - specific background distribution . ]",
    "the correlations between pairs of homologous residues can be summarized by an amino acid substitution matrix , @xmath3 , whose entries represent the log probability of observing the homologous pair of amino acids @xmath4 in a properly aligned pair of homologous proteins , against the probability @xmath5 of independently observing the residues in unrelated sequences @xcite .",
    "@xmath6 units of one third bits are traditional for substitution matrices ( base 2 logarithm , @xmath7 , @xmath8 digits ) , although the scaling is arbitrary . assuming conditionally independent replacements",
    ", we can directly construct the large time limit substitution matrix from the background probability distribution , @xmath1 .",
    "fortunately , this large distribution has previously been investigated and parameterized by fitting many columns from multiple alignments of homologous protein sequences to a mixture of dirichlet distributions @xcite .",
    "[ dirichlet ] displays a projection of the dist.20comp parameterization @xcite and fig .",
    "[ fig - matrix ] displays the corresponding substitution matrix .",
    "the mathematical details of matrix construction are given below .    at shorter evolutionary times",
    "there is a significant chance that no mutation has occurred at all , resulting in an enhanced probability of amino acid conservation .",
    "let @xmath9 be the probability of zero mutation events , then the substitution matrix , adjusted for the possibility of zero mutations , is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the kronecker delta function . a reasonable default model for the conservation probability @xmath9 would be to assume that substitutions are poissonian .",
    "then @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the mean time between replacements .",
    "note that although replacement is markovian ( albeit zeroth order ) , the dynamic decay of residue correlations at a position is not , due to the heterogeneity of the amino acid background at that position ( an unobserved hidden variable ) .",
    "[ submatrix2 ] gives the log odds of aligned residues , given the inter - sequence divergence .",
    "conversely , given a prior on the parameter @xmath9 and a fixed alignment we can invert eq .  [ submatrix2 ] and estimate the divergence between sequences . conserved",
    "residues indicate small divergences and unconserved pairs argue for large divergences , although different pairs are weighted differently .        as evolution proceeds ,",
    "the background distribution of a site may itself change , due , for example , to a change in structure of that part of the protein .",
    "this will result in a loss of homology signal under our model , and it may no longer be possible to align the diverged residues , nor to recognize them as homologs .",
    "this is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - decay ] .",
    "various families of substitution matrices have been developed , included pam , blosum and vtml .",
    "different members of the same family represent different degrees of sequence divergence . in principle , we should match the divergence inherent in the substitution matrix to the divergence of the pair of sequences we wish to align @xcite .",
    "however , this is computationally expensive , and , in practice , a single matrix is chosen based on its ability to align remote homologs , on the grounds that matching close homologs is relatively easy @xcite . under the markov model , the chosen matrix has no particular significance .",
    "on the other hand , under our model there is a natural , non - trivial , long time limit matrix ( fig .",
    "[ fig - matrix ] ; eq .  [ submatrix2 ] , @xmath14 ) .",
    "this matrix represents the sequence correlations at any time after the first few mutations , and before the underlying amino acid background itself diverges .",
    "[ fig - decay ] )    figures  [ fig - comparison ] and [ fig - cve ] demonstrate that the dist.20comp matrix represents a similar level of evolutionary divergence , and similar patterns of substitution as blosum62 and vtml160 , two substitution matrices commonly used for pairwise sequence alignment and remote homology detection .",
    "these three matrices have been created using very different evolutionary models ; the dist.20comp matrix is based upon our heterogeneous background / independent substitution model , and the dist.20comp background distribution is , in turn , derived from the columns of many multiple alignments of homologous protein sequences ; the popular blosum matrices are empirically derived from the blocks database of reliable protein sequence alignments @xcite ; and the classic pam @xcite and modern vtml @xcite matrix families are explicitly based upon the markovian model of amino acid replacement . in a recent evaluation of pairwise remote homology detection ,",
    "the vtml160 matrix was found to be more effective than any other vtml , pam or blosum matrix .",
    "@xcite however , as can be seen in figure  [ fig - cve ] , the difference in remote homology detection ability of the three matrices is relatively small .    in summary ,",
    "the important sequence correlations can be adequately explained by assuming conditionally independent replacements drawn from background distributions that vary from site - to - site , but are stable over evolutionary time - scales .",
    "the standard , markovian model of amino acid replacement is unnecessary , overly complicated and inconsistent with observed substitution patterns .",
    "this alternative , heterogeneous background , independent substitution model may be particularly useful for simultaneous sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree reconstruction , since it is necessary to align pairs of close homologs at the leaves , and multiply align many remote homologs at the interior nodes of the tree .",
    "therefore , a simple ( yet realistic ) evolutionary dynamic that is consistent across a wide range of divergence times , and that leads naturally to sequence - sequence , sequence - profile and profile - profile alignment algorithms , may be advantageous .",
    "a collection of homologous residues can be represented by a 20 component canonical amino acid count vector , @xmath15 .",
    "the total number of counts can be 1 , if the observation is taken from a single sequence , or many if the collection represents an entire column of a multiple sequence alignment or some other related set of residues .    in general",
    ", we wish to estimate whether two collections of homologous residues are related , given that detectably homologous residues are drawn from the same background amino acid distribution .",
    "the appropriate test statistic is the log odds of sampling the two amino acid count vectors from the same , but unobserved , background distribution , against the probability of independently sampling the two count vectors from different distributions . @xmath16",
    "the probability of independently sampling a particular collection of homologous residues @xmath17 from the background amino acid profile from which those residues are drawn , @xmath18 , follows the multinomial distribution ; @xmath19 this is the multivariant generalization of the common binomial distribution .",
    "the probability distribution of background distributions @xmath1 has been studied and measured by collating columns from many multiple protein sequence alignments .",
    "since this is a very large , multi - modal probability it is necessary to parameterize the distribution into a convenient representation .",
    "typically , a mixture of dirichlet distributions is used @xcite .",
    "@xmath20 the @xmath21 mixture coefficients @xmath22 sum to one .",
    "the @xmath23th dirichlet distribution is itself parameterized by the 20 component ( canonical amino acids ) non - negative vector @xmath24 , @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "dirichlet mixtures are used to model the background probability partially because dirichlet distributions are naturally conjugate to the multinomial distribution ( and therefore mathematically convenient ) and partially because a dirichlet mixture can approximate the true distribution with a reasonably small number of parameters .",
    "the underlying assumption is that the probability distribution is smooth , but lumpy .",
    "( see fig .",

    ". therefore , the integral over @xmath0 must be equal to the corresponding dirichlet normalization constant , @xmath29 .",
    "the final result is a mixture of multivariate negative hypergeometric distributions @xcite .",
    "the negative hypergeometric is an under - appreciated distribution ( e.g. eq .  11.23 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which bares the same relation to the hypergeometric as the negative binomial does to the binomial distribution .",
    "the multivariant generalization appears in this case as the combination of a dirichlet and a multinomial .",
    "confusingly , the negative hypergeometric distribution is sometimes called the inverse hypergeometric , an entirely different distribution , and vice versa .        for the particular case that one of the count vectors contains only a single observation this score reduces to the standard sequence - profile score frequently used by hidden markov model protein sequence alignment @xcite . this is inevitable , since the underlying mathematics is the same .",
    "if both count vectors contain only a single observation , then this profile - profile score reduces to a pairwise substitution matrix .",
    "note , given that @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( where @xmath36 is a kronecker delta function ) , then all but the @xmath37th element of the product @xmath38 cancels .",
    "thus , @xmath39      an interesting feature of this model is that it provides a unified homology match score for sequence - sequence , sequence - profile and profile - profile alignment ( eq .  [ final ] ) .",
