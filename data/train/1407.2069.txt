    "already many years ago , the possibility of a cross - over from cooper pairs in the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) state to a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of molecules was discussed theoretically @xcite .",
    "later , nozires and schmitt - rink ( nsr ) developed a theory that correctly interpolates between the critical temperatures in the two limits @xcite .",
    "in this theory , only equal densities of the two species forming the pairs ( which we will denote by spin indices @xmath0 ) were considered .",

    "one tries to discover , e.g. , phases with exotic pairing , like the fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) phase @xcite . also the extremely polarized case , where only a single particle of spin @xmath3 is put into a fermi sea of spin @xmath4 , bears interesting physics : when passing though the feshbach resonance from the attractive ( @xmath5 ) to the repulsive ( @xmath6 ) side , one expects that the ground state transforms from a fermi sea plus a fermionic quasiparticle , the so - called polaron , into a fermi sea plus a bosonic molecule @xcite . to our knowledge",
    ", there is so far no unique many - body theory that can describe the imbalanced fermi gas in the cross - over and that reproduces in the limit of extreme polarization the polaronic and the molecular ground state , depending on the value of the scattering length @xmath1 .    as mentioned before ,",
    "the original nsr theory was formulated in order to describe the bec - bcs crossover in a two - component ( @xmath7 ) fermi gas with equal populations . within this approach",
    ", the critical temperature @xmath8 as a function of the chemical potential @xmath9 is obtained from the thouless criterion , i.e. , it is the temperature where the in - medium t matrix develops a pole , @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are , respectively , the total energy ( measured from @xmath13 ) and momentum of the pair , and @xmath14 is obtained by summing ladder diagrams , see fig .",
    "[ figladder ] .    ]    as a function of @xmath9 , the critical temperature obtained in this way is exactly the same as within bcs theory .",
    "the difference between bcs and nsr comes from the inclusion of pair correlations into the relationship @xmath15 between the number density and the chemical potential .",
    "this is done by including diagrams of the type shown in fig .",

    "the rpa correlation energy ( i.e. , correction to the hf energy ) can be obtained from the usual coupling - constant integration @xcite , where one integrates , however , only over the coupling constant appearing explicitly in the bubble or ladder diagrams , respectively , keeping the hf field fixed .",
    "the formula ( [ eqnfirstorder ] ) for the green s function to be used , e.g. , in the calculation of the correlation energy has to be slightly modified : now @xmath25 denotes the hf green s function , and @xmath26 is the self - energy without the hf field .    in practice , the subtleties about whether one has to use hf or free propagators are not relevant for us , since in the case of a renormalized zero - range interaction , as it is generally used in ultracold atom systems , the hf shift vanishes anyway @xcite .",

    "@xcite up to a certain strong attraction below the unitary limit , see fig .",
    "[ figpolaron ] . again , this is a limitation due to the truncation of the dyson equation at first order .",
    "the calculations presented here were all based on the zero - temperature formalism .",
    "it is therefore not obvious how one can generalize them to finite temperature . as it will be shown in a separate article @xcite , it is possible to recover the results of the present work in the @xmath31 limit of the finite - temperature formalism if one includes the shift of the quasiparticle energies self - consistently into the green s functions @xmath25 that build the ladder diagrams and the self - energy .    on a quantitative level ,",
    "the critical polarization we obtain with our approach is ( at least in the unitary limit ) much larger than the one found experimentally @xcite and in qmc calculations @xcite .",
    "this calls for an improvement of the rpa approach .",
    "several lines are open",
    ". one obvious drawback of the rpa is that it calculates ground - state correlations but the ingredients to rpa , e.g. , the occupation numbers , are given by the non - correlated ones , cf .",
    "the step functions in eqs .",
    "( [ eqnjhh ] ) and ( [ eqnjppcutoff ] ) .",
    "since we have calculated the correlated occupation numbers , a natural idea would be to insert those in an improved rpa and iterate to self - consistency .",
    "this would probably wash out the discontinuities in @xmath153 ( cf .",
    "[ figplotj0 ] ) and thereby reduce the critical polarization .",
    "such a procedure is often applied in nuclear physics and called there `` renormalized rpa '' @xcite .",
    "a still farther reaching ( but numerically difficult ) improvement of rpa is the so - called `` self - consistent rpa '' , in which not only occupation numbers are included self - consistently , but also vertex corrections @xcite .",
    "another probably important thing would be the inclusion of screening of the interaction , which is known to reduce the gap in the balanced case ( gorkov - melik - barkhudarov correction @xcite ) and which therefore could also reduce the critical polarization .",
    "however , it is not clear how to include these particle - hole effects consistently into the particle - particle ladders .",
