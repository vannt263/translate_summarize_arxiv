    "the direct experimental observation of quasi - particles with non - abelian anyonic statistics is an active area of research that may lead to the construction of a fault - tolerant topological quantum computer  @xcite .",
    "there are several condensed matter systems under study expected to exhibit non - abelian excitations , including one - dimensional nano - wires adjoining s - wave superconductors  @xcite , cold atomic systems with spin - orbit interactions  @xcite , @xmath1 superconductors  @xcite , topological insulators on superconducting substrates  @xcite , thin semiconductor films in contact with ordinary superconductors  @xcite and others .",
    "perhaps the most discussed system where non - abelian anyons are proposed to exist  @xcite is in the fractional quantum hall effect  @xcite ( fqhe ) in the half - filled second landau level  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath2 , where strongly interacting electrons in two - dimensions ( 2d ) are under the influence of a strong perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "even though the fqhe at @xmath2 was first observed in 1987  @xcite it remains as somewhat of an enigma since the physics of this fqh state differs considerably from the well - known laughlin  @xcite and composite fermion@xcite family of fractional quantum hall states and is the only even denominator fraction to be observed in mono - layer quantum hall systems so far . at present , the leading theoretical description for @xmath0 , is the spin polarized moore - read ( mr ) pfaffian wavefunction  @xcite introduced in 1991 , whose excitations have been theoretically shown to have non - abelian anyonic statistics  @xcite . despite this prediction and considerable numerical evidence  @xcite supporting the mr pfaffian description ,",
    "non - abelian anyons have yet to be directly observed experimentally in quantum hall systems , although there are recent tantalizing experimental results which are interpreted as being consistent with the 5/2 fqh quasiparticles being non - abelian  @xcite .",
    "but there exist alternative descriptions for the even - denominator fqhe that do not require non - abelian statistics , and one of the leading alternatives is the unpolarized halperin 331 state  @xcite .",
    "part of the halperin ( m , m , n ) family of abelian fractional quantum hall states  @xcite , the 331 state is observed in half - filled quantum hall bi - layers where even denominator fractions are commonly observed and well understood as belonging to 331 type multicomponent abelian even - denominator fqhe states  @xcite . resolving the true nature of the @xmath2 ( i.e. whether the excitations are abelian or non - abelian ) would help determine if the fractional quantum hall effect can potentially serve as a testbed for topological quantum computing .",
    "for example , if the 331 type state can be convincingly ruled out for the 5/2 fqhe , this will provide further indirect evidence for the 5/2 fqhe as being the non - abelian moore - read type state .",
    "determining the spin order ( i.e. , whether the actual 5/2 fqh state is spin polarized or not ) could possibly help resolve the nature of the @xmath2 state . since the mr pfaffian ( halperin 331 ) is , by construction , spin polarized  @xcite ( unpolarized ) , determining the spin polarization of the state can unequivocally rule - out either the mr pfaffian or the unpolarized 331 description for @xmath0 .",
    "however the spin - order of @xmath0 has a long history of inconclusive and seemingly contradictory studies .",
    "one of the earliest experiments on this matter , for example , reported the collapse of the @xmath0 fqhe state in a tilted magnetic field , suggesting an unpolarized fqhe state@xcite . but",
    "this experiment was followed by a seminal numerical study by morf@xcite which showed that even in the limit of zero zeeman energy , a polarized state has lower ground state energy per particle than a fully unpolarized state at @xmath0 .",
    "subsequent theoretical studies reported similar results@xcite , and it is now understood that the collapse in the original `` tilt '' experiments was likely due to the appearance of compressible `` striped '' phases  @xcite or from orbital coupling of the in - plane magnetic field@xcite . to avoid these issues , liu et al .",
    "@xcite performed an `` altered '' tilt experiment where the in - plane magnetic field is kept small by varying the charge density and showed that the @xmath0 state remains stable for relatively large tilt angles .",
    "recent rather impressive experiments performed by tiemann et al .",
    "@xcite and stern et al .",
    "@xcite provide strong evidence supporting a fully spin polarized 5/2 fqhe state .",
    "but a notable exception is an earlier experiment by stern et al .",
    "@xcite using photoluminescence spectroscopy to probe polarization , suggesting that the @xmath0 state is actually unpolarized .",
    "a similar result was also seen in a study by rhone et al .",
    "@xcite where spin - order is probed via resonant light scattering .",
    "it is possible that the signatures seen in these optical experiments  @xcite are due to local spin order near a charge impurity@xcite and are , therefore , inconclusive , but such results still leave some doubt to the actual nature of spin - order in this state  @xcite .",
    "the most convincing measurement to date are those by tiemann et al .",
    "@xcite and stern et al .",
    ",  @xcite , which do indicate a spin - polarized 5/2 fqhe .",
    "our goal in the current work is to provide a reasonably complete study of spin - polarization comparing the candidate states mr pfaffian versus 331 with respect to the 5/2 fqhe using direct numerical techniques in reasonably realistic theoretical models to see if one or the other can be ruled out purely on the basis of numerical studies .",
    "an alternative explanation that may resolve the seemingly conflicting results on spin - order that we explore here is the possibility that the @xmath0 fqhe state is not unique@xcite . in other words",
    "there may be more than one incompressible fqhe state , each with different spin polarization , that satisfy conditions to be experimentally observed at @xmath0 .",
    "whichever fqhe state is observed in an experimental sample may depend on certain details of the sample or experimental parameters because the competing polarized and unpolarized states may be relatively close in energy so that one or the other gets stabilized by the minute details of the sample parameters .    in this work",
    ", we explore this possibility by comparing the energy of two trial fqhe wavefunctions with respect to small deviations in the system hamiltonian : the spin polarized moore read ( mr ) pfaffian and the unpolarized halperin 331 state . to examine the possibility of a phase change between spin polarized and unpolarized incompressible fqhe states within the @xmath0 plateau , we focus entirely on the spin polarized mr pfaffian and the spin unpolarized halperin 331 state and",
    "examine how their respective ground state energies change with respect to small alterations to the effective interaction potential . by appealing to the variational theorem ,",
    "whichever state has the lowest ground state energy ( strictly speaking , the lowest free energy ) provides a better physical description  of course , the variational theorem can not rule out the possibility of a lower energy ground state that we are not investigating ( in fact , this is the likely scenario in the nu=1/2 state in the lowest landau level where experimentally an fqhe has never been observed indicating that some kind of a compressible non - fqh state is likely to be lower in energy than either the mr pfaffian or the halperin 331 state ) . to achieve this goal",
    "we alter the 2d coulomb potential in two ways : i ) through the finite thickness effect , and ii ) by directly perturbing the first two haldane pseudopotentials  @xcite ( see below ) .    in the finite thickness effect",
    ", the non - zero thickness of the quasi-2d electron system provides an effective potential slightly modified from the purely ideal 2d coulomb potential , which we refer to as the  coulomb point \" in this work . since",
    "fqhe states have been shown to be sensitive to this finite thickness effect and the thickness is expected to vary for different experimental samples , the finite thickness effect is a natural area to investigate  @xcite ( in these references the finite - thickness effect was considered in the context of spin polarized electrons via exact diagonalization ) .",
    "although our results do not suggest a direct quantum phase transition between the mr pfaffian and the halperin 331 in the second landau level ( sll ) induced by tuning the finite thickness , the energy difference between the two states decreases with sample thickness , implying that other perturbations may make either state energetically favorable for very deep wells ; some of these other perturbations could be landau level mixing , disorder , effect of nearby gates , self - consistency of the confining potential itself , etc .",
    ", which are not considered in our work since they are far too sample - specific to be treated theoretically at this stage ..    our second approach to altering the 2d coulomb potential  directly perturbing the first two haldane pseudopotentials  @xcite  provides us a general theoretical probe that can identify areas of interest which may be reached experimentally via other effects .",
    "the haldane pseudopotentials , @xmath3 , parametrize the effective interaction potential in terms of the relative angular momenta @xmath4 between two particles , and thus , perturbing the first two pseudopotentials ( i.e. @xmath4 = 1,2 ) alters the short range interactions between electrons ( note that in this study , we leave the @xmath4 = 0 term fixed ) .",
    "the method of altering pseudopoentials is a common approach taken in fqhe exact diagonalization numerical studies aimed at probing sensitivities to different moments in the interaction strength , however , this approach has not yet been attempted in vmc studies to the best of our knowledge .",
    "we note that our two alternative ways of introducing small deviations or tuning away from the pure coulomb point ( realistic finite thickness effect and varying the lowest pseudopotentials ) are complementary theoretical methods of tuning the system hamiltonian since the finite thickness correction modifies all the coulomb pseudopotentials in a complex manner which can not simply be simulated by changing the two lowest pseudopotentials .",
    "we also examine the lowest landau level ( lll ) ( i.e. @xmath5 ) in addition to the second landau level ( sll ) ( i.e. @xmath0 ) for comparison . in the lll",
    ", no incompressible even - denominator fqhe has been experimentally observed in mono - layer systems to date , but there are several theoretical proposals to engineer certain experimental conditions in such a way that even - denominator states are energetically favorable  @xcite . in these cases",
    "the halperin 331 state and the mr pfaffian are likely possibilities . in our study of the lll",
    ", we find that either state may be energetically favorable in the lll depending on the pseudopotential deviations .",
    "this is in contrast to our results in the sll where we find that the mr pfaffian is generally lower in energy than the halperin 331 state for most deviations examined , suggesting that the mr pfaffian description is , indeed , better suited for the half - filled sll , i.e. , @xmath0 .",
    "this is of course also consistent with the most recent experimental status of the subject where the sll 5/2 fqhe appears to be spin - polarized .",
    "our work , however , indicates that the corresponding lll situation is more delicate , and if an incompressible fqhe is ever observed in a half - filled lll monolayer 2d system , it could either be a mr spin - polarized pfaffian or a halperin spin - unpolarized 331 state .",
    "we add a theoretical subtlety here which has sometimes caused some confusion in the literature .",
    "the halperin 331 state in general does not obey the full su(2 ) symmetry ( specifically , the so - called fock condition necessary for a spin - independent many - body hamiltonian which must conserve the total spin of the system ) , and can not therefore be a true eigenstate of the single - layer coulomb hamiltonian since by definition this hamiltonian obeys the full su(2 ) symmetry because the coulomb interaction is spin - independent  the 331 state was originally conceived for the double - layer 2d system where the coulomb interaction does indeed depend on the layer index and is in general not su(2 ) invariant in the layer index .",
    "this is , however , not a problem for our vmc analysis since we are only interested in comparing energies between variational ground states ( which do not care about the symmetry of the hamiltonian ) and are not trying to obtain the exact theoretical eigenstate of the system ( which would be an impossible task any way , even the mr pfaffian can at best be a good variational state for the system and by no means the exact eigenstate ) . in the end ,",
    "the best theory we can hope for is to obtain a variational ground state ( mr pfaffian or 331 ) which is adiabatically connected to the exact ground state of the experimental system without any intervening quantum phase transition so that the spin - polarization status of the variational ground state and the exact ground state remains the same .",
    "thus , for our purpose , both the mr pfaffian and the 331 are perfectly ( and equally ) legitimate variational choices , and which ever has lower vmc energy could be construed as the  correct \" ground state of the system ( at least within the narrow , but very reasonable , restricted variational choice of only two candidate wavefunctions ) .",
    "we also mention that all our work leaves out the trivial zeeman energy of the system arising from the applied magnetic field creating the landau levels in the first place , which helps the spin - polarized state over the spin - unpolarized state .",
    "since the applied field is typically rather small for the @xmath0 fqhe , leaving out zeeman energy ( which is trivial to include for any given field ) is probably a reasonable approximation , but it is helpful to remember that even if a spin - unpolarized ground state arises from our vmc analysis , the zeeman energy could in principle eventually win over , leading to the experimental state being spin - polarized . the reverse , however , is not true , i.e. if the zero - zeeman splitting situation has a ( spontaneously symmetry - broken ) spin - polarized ground state , it is unlikely that finite zeeman splitting will change the ground state to a spin singlet .",
    "we use variational monte carlo ( vmc ) methods in the same spirit as refs . and to estimate the energy per particle of the halperin 331 state and the mr pfaffian state for altered coulomb potentials in the lowest and second landau level with up to @xmath6 electrons and extrapolate to the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath7 ) . to examine the finite thickness effect",

    ". there are other finite thickness potentials that we can explore  @xcite , however we expect the infinite square well potential to be sufficient in obtaining a qualitative comparison between the two states@xcite .",
    "we also examine the effect of directly perturbing the haldane pseudopotentials  @xcite @xmath3 for the coulomb potential in lll and sll .",
    "in particular , we examine the effect of the perturbations @xmath12 and @xmath13 for pseudopotentials derived from the coulomb potential ( i.e. @xmath14 ) . in the planar geometry ,",
    "the haldane pseudopotentials for the @xmath15th landau level are given in terms of the fourier transform of the effective interaction potential @xmath16 by @xmath17 ^ 2l_m(k^2)e^{-k^2}v_{\\mathrm{eff}}(k ) } \\label{eq : pseudo}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 are laguerre polynomials .",
    "note that we are using planar pseudopotentials due to two primary reasons : ( 1 ) it is simpler to use planar @xmath19 s and ( 2 ) for such large systems @xmath20 examined in our studies there is very little difference between spherical and planar pseudopotentials .    in order to use vmc methods to estimate wavefunction energies , we require an effective potential in real space , @xmath21 , such that the application of eq .",

    "the immediate difficulty we run into is that there is no clear procedure to invert eq .",
    "( [ eq : pseudo ] ) to obtain @xmath21 for arbitrary @xmath22it is a rather non - unique one - to - many mapping .",
    "also , even in the unperturbed case , estimating energies in the sll is not straight - forward since most fqhe trial wavefunctions under study do not have a closed - form expression in the sll . to get around these difficulties , we chose a variable effective potential with fitting parameters , @xmath23 , and set these parameters such that the result of applying eq .",
    "( [ eq : pseudo ] ) on the effective potential very closely matches the perturbed pseudopotentials . and",
    "when examining the sll , we `` simulate '' the sll in the lll by fitting the effective potential within the lll to the perturbed sll pseudopotentials  @xcite , that is , we project the sll into the lll .",
    "several forms for the effective potential have been used for previous monte carlo studies of the fqhe @xcite . for our study",
    ", we use the following form for the effective potential ( in units of @xmath24 ) : @xmath25 we choose this form because for large enough @xmath26 , the potential fits both even and odd pseudopotentials to a reasonable degree  only odd pseudopotentials are important when fully polarized or spinless wavefunctions are under investigation  and the fits to @xmath3 for large @xmath4 ( i.e. @xmath27 ) are generally consistent across different perturbations , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , allowing us to make fair comparisons between different perturbations . in choosing the number of terms , @xmath26 , in the effective potential , there is a trade - off between tighter fits to the pseudopotentials for larger @xmath26 and ease with which the monte carlo converges  the addition of terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : veff ] ) leads to an oscillatory potential that takes , in general , more iterations to reach monte carlo convergence . for our study",

    "it is possible , in fact quite likely for the lll , that a finite zeeman splitting will induce a transition from the halperin 331 to the mr pfaffian state , but neither may be the true ground state in the lll since no @xmath74 fqhe has ever been observed experimentally . additionally , our results show that the energy of the mr pfaffian is more sensitive to changes in the pseudopotentials than the halperin 331 state , where the mr pfaffian energy decreases with increasing @xmath29 and decreasing @xmath28 .",
    "the energy of the halperin 331 state , in contrast , is generally insensitive ( in comparison to that of the mr pfaffian ) with slight decreases for @xmath83 and @xmath84 , cf .",

    ", the mr pfaffian becomes energetically favorable for small increases in @xmath65 above the coulomb point . in the sll ,",
    "the halperin 331 state becomes favorable for relatively large deviations from the coulomb point , ( i.e. @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) , again in the absence of the zeeman energy ",
    "given the small difference between the two vmc energies , it is quite likely that the mr pfaffian state has lower energy than the halperin 331 state for all thickness values and all deviations from the coulomb point once the zeeman energy is taken into account since the zeeman energy would always prefer the spin - polarized state .",
    "our study adds to the growing body of evidence@xcite supporting the spin polarized mr pfaffian description for fqhe at @xmath0 .",
    "of course , conclusive verification of the mr pfaffian description requires the direct experimental observation of non - abelian anyons . but",
    "given the difficulty in conclusively detecting non - abelian signatures  @xcite , novel experimental techniques will be needed for definitive verification .",
    "lastly , we emphasize that our study additionally serves as a  proof of principle \" for vmc studies of various fqh systems that are described by effective potentials .",
    "effective potentials are needed when considering certain realistic effects such as finite thickness , landau level mixing , higher landau level fqhe , disorder , etc . , or by simply artificially manipulating various haldane pseudopotentials .",
    "our work establishes that the vmc technique is a viable alternative to the exact diagonalization method in theoretically studying the ground state properties of fqhe including various realistic effects which are often hard to implement using the finite size diagonalization method ."
