    "observations indicate that there is a tight correlation between the fir and radio emission among star forming galaxies ( sanders and mirabel , 1996 ) . at 1.4ghz ,",
    "however , significant deviations from this relation , though with a larger scatter , are observed either in ultra luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , where q may reach values as high as 3 ( condon et al , 1991 ) , or in the central regions of rich clusters where there seem to be a significant excess of star forming galaxies with q below 2 ( miller and owen , 2001 ) . to cast light on these problems",
    ", we have analysed the evolution of fir and radio emission of a starburst model , consisting of a superposition of an exponentially declining star - burst episode to a quiescent disk galaxy .",
    "the burst is described by its strength , its age @xmath1 and the e - folding time @xmath2 .",
    "thermal radio emission is related to the ionizing photon flux from young stars , while non thermal emission , -@xmath3- consisting of the contribution from supernova remnants and an unidentified mechanism , is normalized to the ratio between nt radio emission and supernova rate , observed in the galaxy ( condon , 1992 ) . by adopting @xmath4 ( cappellaro , private communication ) and @xmath5 berkhuijsen ( 1984 ) , we obtain @xmath6erg / s / hz / yr@xmath7 . in order to reproduce the observed average slope of the nt radio emission in normal spiral galaxies , @xmath8  0.9 .",
    "the infrared emission depends on the time ( t@xmath9 ) by which young populations get rid of their parental molecular clouds ( eg .",
    "silva et al 1998 ) .",
    "we have found that with an escape time of t@xmath103myr and a visual extinction of a@xmath11=1mag , we reproduce well the fir / radio correlation observed in normal star forming galaxies -constant sfr and salpeter imf between 0.15 and 120m@xmath12 , over the last few 100 myr- namely q@xmath13=2.3 . the adopted values are consistent with independent results of recent infrared modelling of spiral galaxies . with this model",
    "we also obtain @xmath14 , in good agreement with the one obtained by carilli ( 2001 ) .    in the analysis of a sample of compact ulirgs ( condon et al , 1991 )",
    ", we adopt larger obscuration times and a visual extinction of a@xmath11=10mag , as implied by optical and uv properties of observed seds of a few ulirgs . with the help of a new diagnostic diagram , which contrasts the q ratio with the radio slope ( fig.[allslo ] )",
    ", we may draw the following conclusions .",
    "our star burst models may account for the infrared and radio emission of the observed ulirgs .",
    "the mass involved in the burst , for the sample analysed is typically between 10@xmath15m@xmath12 and 10@xmath16m@xmath12 .",
    "the range of q@xmath13 is due to a combined effect of free - free absorption ( see also condon et al . 1991 ) and real star burst evolution .",
    "free - free absorption induces an evident trend in the q vs radio - slope diagram , with the higher q being accompanied by a shallower slope .",
    "estimated optical depths for free - free absorption at 1.4ghz are between 0.2 and 1 .",
    "the derived emission measures are consistent with the typical small sizes deduced from high resolution radio and mid infrared images ( condon et al .",
    "1991 , soifer et al .",
    "2000 ) and the typical ionized gas masses involved in the model star burst episode .",
    "at 8.4ghz free - free absorption becomes negligible ( @xmath17 ) and the previous trend disappears .",
    "the value of q@xmath18 is a measure of the age of the star burst .",
    "very young star bursts display an excess of fir emission relative to the radio emission because the latter is initially contributed mainly by the free - free process . as the star burst ages , the non - thermal contribution increases and becomes the dominant source .",
    "the relative contribution of radio emission increases and the ratio q@xmath18 decreases .",
    "we suggest that a similar diagram between 8.4ghz and a higher frequency would better highlight the evolutionary status of compact ulirgs because the slope , unaffected by free - free absorption , would provide an independent estimate of the age .",
    "models with constant star formation during the burst , always have a value of q@xmath18 which remains too high at later times . as the only viable alternative",
    ", the star formation rate _ must _ decline strongly with time .",
    "models with t@xmath9=18myr and @xmath19=18myr or t@xmath9=100myr and @xmath19=5myr reproduce the observed data .",
    "apparently , the star formation in ulirgs is strongly peaked and the burst is younger than about 60 myr .",
    "the determination of the star formation rate from common _ average _ relations is obviously misleading in this evolutionary scenario .",
    "the open square in fig.[allslo ] refers to the seyfert 1 galaxy mrk 231 . by looking to the offset with respect to the other objects ( or the obscured models with the lowest allowed q ) we estimate that the agn is contributing to the 75% at least , of its total radio emission . in fig.[allslo ] we also show a post starburst model with the same obscuration of normal spirals , but a peaked sfr .",
    "we thus guess that a low q in star forming cluster galaxies is a signature of a dying star formation , recently ( @xmath20150myr ago ) interrupted by environmental effects .      1 berkhuijsen , e. m. , 1984,a&a , 140 , 431 carilli , c.l . , 2001 , astro - ph0011199v2 condon , j.j . , 1992 , araa , 30 , 575 condon , j.j . , huang , z.p . ,",
