    "in quantum field theory , because of quantum nature of the vacuum state , its properties depend crucially on both the local geometry and topology of the background spacetime .",

    "this is the topological casimir effect which has been investigated for large number of geometries ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . in higher - dimensional models with compact extra dimensions ,",
    "the dependence of the vacuum energy on the length scale of the compact subspace provides a stabilization mechanism for moduli fields .",
    "in addition , the topological casimir effect can be a source of dark energy driving the accelerating expansion of the universe at recent epoch @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we consider an exactly solvable problem for a charged massive fermionic field with two types of the topological vacuum polarization .",
    "the first one is generated by a planar angle deficit in the cosmic string geometry and the second one is induced by the compactification of the string axis .",
    "recently , the calculations of topological casimir densities associated with a quantum scalar field in compactified cosmic string spacetime , has been developed in @xcite .",
    "the cosmic strings are among the most interesting topological defects which may have been created by phase transitions in the early universe @xcite .",
    "though the observation data on the cosmic microwave background have ruled out cosmic strings as primary source for primordial density perturbations , they are still candidate for the generation of a number of interesting physical effects such as gamma ray bursts @xcite , gravitational waves @xcite and high energy cosmic rays @xcite . recently ,",

    "the geometry of the spacetime produced by an idealized infinite straight cosmic has a conical structure .",
    "it is locally flat except on the top of the string where it has a delta shaped curvature tensor .",
    "this nontrivial structure raises a number of interesting physical effects .",
    "one of these concerns the effect of a string on the properties of quantum vacuum .",
    "explicit calculations for vacuum expectation values of the energy - momentum tensor associated with various fields in the vicinity of a string have been done in @xcite-@xcite . moreover , considering the presence of a magnetic flux running along the cosmic strings , there appear additional contributions to the corresponding vacuum polarization effects associated with charged fields @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the presence of a magnetic flux along the cosmic string induces vacuum current densities , as well .",
    "this phenomenon has been investigated for massless scalar field in @xcite and recently for massive one in @xcite . there",
    "the authors have shown that the induced vacuum current densities along the azimuthal direction appear if the ratio of the magnetic flux by the quantum one has a nonzero fractional part .",
    "the analysis of induced fermionic currents in higher - dimensional cosmic string spacetime in the presence of a magnetic flux have been developed in mello10 .",
    "moreover , induced fermionic current by a magnetic flux in @xmath0-dimensional conical spacetime and in presence of a circular boundary has also been analyzed in @xcite ( for combined effects of topology and boundaries on the quantum vacuum in the geometry of a cosmic string see brev95 ) .",

    "this vev is among the most important local characteristics of the quantum vacuum .",
    "in addition to describing the physical structure of a charged quantum field at a given point , the current acts as the source in the maxwell equations and plays an important role in modeling a self - consistent dynamics involving the electromagnetic field .    we have organized the paper as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we present the background geometry associated with the spacetime under consideration and construct the complete set of normalized positive- and negative - energy fermionic wave - functions obeying quasiperiodic boundary condition with an arbitrary phase along the string axis . in section [ sec3 ] , by using the mode - summation method , we evaluate the renormalized fermionic vacuum current density induced by a magnetic flux running along the string s axis . as we shall see , the charge density and the radial current vanish .",
    "the azimuthal current density is decomposed into two parts : the first one corresponding to the geometry of a cosmic string without compactification and the second one being induced by the compactification . as a consequence of the string axis compactification",
    ", there appears a non - vanishing axial current .",
    "this is a purely topological effect and is investigated in section [ sec4 ] for the general case of periodicity conditions along the compact dimension .",

    "the most relevant conclusions of the paper are summarized in section [ conc ] . throughout the paper",
    "we use the units with @xmath2 .",
    "the main objective of this section is to obtain the complete set of normalized fermionic wave - functions in a four - dimensional cosmic string spacetime considering that these fields obey a quasiperiodicity condition along the string s axis .",

    "the quantum dynamic of a massive charged spinor field in curved spacetime and in the presence of a electromagnetic four - vector potential , @xmath13 , is governed by the dirac equation @xmath14where @xmath15 are the dirac matrices in curved spacetime and @xmath16 is the spin connection .",

    "the normalization condition on the functions provides an extra equation .",
    "consequently , one of the coefficients remains arbitrary . in order to determine this coefficient some additional condition",

    "the necessity for this condition is related to the fact that the quantum numbers @xmath76 do not specify the fermionic wave - function uniquely and some additional quantum number is required .    in order to specify the second constant we impose the condition @xmath77by taking into account ( [ b12 ] ) , we can write , @xmath78with the condition ( [ adcond ] ) , the fermionic mode functions are uniquely specified by the set of quantum numbers @xmath79 .",
