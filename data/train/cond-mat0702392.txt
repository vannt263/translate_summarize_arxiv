    "interexciton interaction in semiconductor double quantum wells is intensively studied , particularly in connection with a problem of revealing bose - einstein condensation of excitons @xcite .",
    "important results were obtained under investigation of so - called `` indirect excitons '' in double quantum wells . in the case of applying the electric field , recombination of indirect exciton is hampered and the lifetime becomes long , therefore great concentration of excitons can be created . in semiconductor alloys based on gaas / algaas double quantum wells ,",
    "a narrow luminescence line was revealed at low temperatures , which had some specific features : the line appears at pumping , larger than some threshold value , which depends on temperature ; the emission intensity of the line depends super - linearly on pumping etc . @xcite . in exciton luminescence spectrum in double quantum well",
    "the luminescence from the laser spot region was revealed to be surrounded by a concentric bright ring of emission , separated from the central spot by a dark region @xcite ; the distance between the ring and the laser spot enlarges with pumping growth , and at low temperatures the ring was observed to be broken down into periodically sited fragments @xcite .",
    "there are different interpretations of the structure formation .",
    "a series of explanations of the phenomena was connected with bose statistics of excitons . according to @xcite ,",
    "the mechanism , based on stimulated bose character of exciton statistics in relaxation process , gives rise to instability in the exciton subsystem . in papers",
    "@xcite it was shown the possibility of appearance of periodic structures in solutions of nonlinear quantum equations like nonlinear schrodinger equation .",
    "but the investigation of observed pecularities , changes in the structure depending on temperature , pumping and the parameters of exciton system in @xcite was not considered .",
    "another alternative approach for the explanation of the peculiarities in the system with great exciton density was developed in [ 913 ] .",
    "the explanation is not connected with bose statistics of excitons . in these papers a traditional phase transition theory , generalized for the case of unstable particles and a presence of the pumping , is applied . the appearance and the properties of the forming structures",
    "are related with : 1 ) the presence of the attraction between excitons , which leads to condensed phase formation ( the possibility of condensed phase formation of indirect excitons was shown in @xcite ) , and 2 ) non - equilibrium of the system , caused by finite exciton lifetime .    as it was shown in @xcite ,",
    "the system of attracting excitons is unstable with respect to density super - lattice formation .",
    "the properties of exciton condensation in 2d systems in a statistical approach , generalized for the case particles with finite lifetime , were studied in @xcite .",
    "ring fragmentation outside of the laser irradiation region in quantum wells observed in @xcite was explained in a statistical approach @xcite and in spinodal decay model , generalized for the system of unstable particles @xcite . the emerging structure in case of interaction of two laser spots ,",
    "was simulated in @xcite .",
    "the method employed in @xcite , applied for the investigation of a nonuniform system , allowed to explain the transition between fragmented luminescence ring and a continuous one with temperature or other parameters changing , the formation of localized spots in the emission , caused by defects in the structure and etc .",
    "so , the appearance of a structure in high - density exciton systems was explained in the papers [ 913]with the processes of self - organization in non - equilibrium systems caused by both the finite value of the exciton lifetime and the presence of pumping .",
    "such explanations do not require the bose - einstain condensation of excitons .",
    "recently the interesting effects were observed in the papers [ 1618 ] .",
    "the excitation and emission of indirect excitons was performed through `` a window '' in metallic gate with the diameter of order of several micrometers . in the case of excitation intensity growth , a regular ring pattern of equidistant bright spots along the perimeter of the window was observed . at higher pumping or temperatures the structure washed out and transforms to the emission from a ring . with expanding window size ,",
    "the structure became complicated .",
    "these experiments are explained in this paper , continuing the viewpoint of the papers [ 913 ] .",
    "let us deal with qualitative picture of structure appearance of exciton condensed phase in quantum well in the case of a window in the electrode . increasing the electric field , the position of the indirect exciton level shifts towards low energies . under the window",
    "the electric field is smaller , than in the region remoted from the window , therefore , a hump for exciton potential energy arises in the well .",
    "excitons , created by the light through the window , roll down in nonuniform field from the middle of the well towards the region under the window . due to a finite lifetime they can not move far away from the region under the window . as a result , in the well under the perimeter of the window the maximum of the exciton density appears .",
    "thus , at the pumping growth the condensed phase forms in the region of maximum exciton density , i.e. , on the ring along the perimeter of window , _ like it was _ observed in experiments [ 1618 ] .",
    "let us find the exciton potential energy , caused by the window presence in metallic electrode above the quantum well plane ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "= 0.8    fig .  1 .",
    "scheme of the system .    in external electric field",
    "an exciton gets additional energy @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the dipole momentum of an exciton ( the axis @xmath2 is perpendicular to the quantum well plane ) . in experiments [ 1618 ]",
    "semiconductor with double quantum well is covered by a metallic mask , in which a round window is located .",
    "the uniform electric field of the intensity @xmath3 is applied perpendicular to the quantum well plane . due to the presence of the window in the mask ,",
    "the electric field is distorted at immediate proximity of the window .",
    "let us calculate nonuniform addition to external uniform electric filed into the exciton potential energy .",
    "let the upper electrode with the coordinate @xmath4 has a round window of the radius @xmath5 .",
    "for the determination of the field we have to solve laplace equation for the potential with the following boundary conditions : the potential of the electrostatic filed is constant at both electrodes ; the difference of the potentials of electrodes ought to be equal to the value , at which the field between electrodes is equal to @xmath3 far away from the window . for that we shall use the solution of the task given in @xcite about the field , created by the ground plane with a window , located in external electric field of the intensity @xmath3 .",
    "as a matter of fact , this solution does not satisfy the condition of the constant potential on the lower electrode .",
    "but a change of the potential introduced by the window falls down with moving off from the window as a dipole potential @xcite , and thus , it is small in the region of the lower electrode under conditions that @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the distance between electrodes .",
    "let us consider that @xmath8 , @xmath9 , i.e. , the plane of the well is located significantly nearer to the upper electrode , than to lower one . besides this , for using the solution of the task @xcite , in which the environment for both sides of the window is identical , we consider , that the upper electrode ( the electrode with the window ) is inner and is located inside semiconductor environment .",
    "so , the considered system slightly differs from the investigated in the experiments [ 1618 ] , but it gives the same qualitative behavior of the potential at the change of the both the window radius and the location of the well relatively the electrode .",
    "thus , the additional potential , created by the window is    @xmath10    where @xmath11 $ ] is flattened spheroidal coordinate , @xmath12 is the radial coordinate in the quantum well plane . at great fields ,",
    "when the electrons and holes are distributed to different wells and dipole momentum does not depend on @xmath3 , the exciton potential energy @xmath13 .",
    "we shall characterize the value of the potential energy by `` pulling force '' @xmath14 .",

    "the pulling force @xmath19 is for all curves    coordinate @xmath9 characterizes the distance from the quantum well to the plane of the electrode with the window .",
    "with decreasing this distance , the potential hump for an exciton , created by the window , enlarges , and the slope becomes more steep . in the region below the window perimeter inside the well round potential",
    "well for excitons arises ( it is showed by the arrow in fig .  2 ) .",
    "the exciton energy in this well is lower , than the energy in regions , remote from the window .",
    "the depth of the well increases , if the plane of the quantum well approaches to the window .",
    "the appearance of the well is related with charge origination nearby edges of the window . in the work @xcite",
    "the shift in the emission spectrum of indirect excitons from the regions below the window perimeter was observed , and this is probably related with the formation of the aforementioned round potential well .",
    "we assume the time of post - excitation establishment of quasilocal equilibrium of electrons and holes and binding into excitons to be much smaller than the time of the exciton lifetime and the time of equilibrium establishment between different regions . in this case",
    ", the free energy of quasilocal state can be regarded as a function of the exciton density .",
