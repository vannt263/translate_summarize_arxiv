    "over the last decade it has become increasingly clear that the cuprate high - temperature superconductors exhibit inhomogeneous electronic structures both in their `` normal '' and superconducting states @xcite . in particular ,",
    "several scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments have produced evidence for real - space inhomogeneity of the superconducting gap without apparent spatial ordering @xcite , while others have demonstrated periodic modulations of the local density of states ( ldos ) @xcite . even if much of the modulated signal can be attributed to interference patterns resulting from scattering of quasiparticles off impurities @xcite ,",
    "at least part of it is likely associated with a spatially periodic structure of the superconducting order and possibly of other coexisting electronic orders @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study , within mean field theory , various realizations of modulated @xmath0-wave superconducting ( dsc ) phases .",
    "we focus on stripe phases in which the lattice - translational invariance is broken in one direction , and calculate their spectral signatures in the clean limit and in the presence of disorder .",
    "the quasiparticle density of states of clean translational - symmetry breaking states has been calculated by podolsky _",
    "there , the effects of a small modulated order parameter added to a large - amplitude @xmath0-wave superconductor , were investigated . here",
    "we extend this treatment to strong modulations , consider also the distribution of spectral weight in momentum space , and study additional scenarios which were not treated in ref . .",
    "in particular , we analyze the case of an anti - phase modulated superconductivity , where the @xmath0-wave order parameter suffers a @xmath1-phase shift across each stripe boundary .",
    "such a state has been proposed recently @xcite as the source for the apparent decoupling between the cu - o planes in 1/8 doped @xcite .",
    "similar structures were also found in a mean - field study of the dsc resonating valence bond phase of the @xmath2 model @xcite .",
    "finally , we supplement the extensive literature on the fourier - transformed local density of states ( ft - ldos ) of disordered superconducting phases , with and without coexisting inhomogeneous orders @xcite , by calculating the ft - ldos of a system with anti - phase modulated superconductivity .",
    "we demonstrate that in sharp contrast to its homogeneous and in - phase modulated counterparts , the anti - phase modulated @xmath0-wave superconductor exhibits a fermi surface which includes extended parts of the non - interacting fermi - surface , as well as closed pockets .",
    "the corresponding zero - energy spectral weight appears predominantly over arcs in momentum space , whose extent shrinks with increasing amplitude of the order parameter .",
    "we find that this general behavior is robust with respect to changes in the details of the band - structure and in the functional form of the modulations .",
    "furthermore , the general evolution of the fermi - surface and the distribution of low - energy spectral weight is largely unaffected by the introduction of additional coexisting orders .",
    "the situation changes significantly when a homogeneous superconducting component is also present in the system . under such conditions the fermi - surface collapses onto nodal points , which include those of the homogeneous @xmath0-wave superconductor , and generically , additional points at positions which depend on details of the modulation and band - structure . upon increasing the constant order parameter the extra nodal points move towards the edges of the reduce brillouin zone ( bz ) , where they eventually disappear .",
    "the presence of the fermi - surface is also reflected in the low - energy density of states of the anti - phase modulated dsc state , and in the momentum - space structure of the ft - ldos of this system when impurity scattering is included in the analysis .",
    "our starting point is a tight binding model of electrons hopping on a square lattice . in the following we consider two non - interacting band structures , corresponding to and @xmath3 .",
    "while most of the scanning tunneling experiments have been carried out on the first , owing to the good quality of surfaces which can be obtained in this system , the latter is probably the most promising compound for the observation of the signatures we discuss in the following , especially in the context of anti - phase modulated superconductivity .",
    "consequently , most of our results will be presented for this material .",
    "to model we use the tight - binding hamiltonian provided by norman _",

    "we study , using a mean - field hamiltonian , the spectral signatures of a spatially modulated @xmath0-wave superconductor .",
    "we also consider within the same approximation , the effects of other inhomogeneous coexisting orders on such properties .",
    "motivated by the experimental evidence for the existence of `` stripes '' in the high - temperature superconductors @xcite , we analyze the case where the discrete translation symmetry of the underlying lattice is broken by the periodic orders in the @xmath8 direction .",
    "since often the observed charge and spin modulation periods are 4 and 8 lattice constants , respectively , we assume a unit cell of either lengths for the modulated orders . in the following",
    "we describe the real - space structure of the various configurations which are studied in the paper .",
    "we consider two configurations for the dsc order . in the first its magnitude",

    "it may reflect a variation in the pairing amplitude as a result of a corresponding modulation of the hole density in the stripe phase , as discussed below .",

    "we have found , however , that the results are hardly affected by this detail , and therefore in the following we report them for the site - centered orders .",
    "various electronic orders have been proposed to exist in the cuprate high - temperature superconductors , especially in the underdoped regime . in this paper",
    "we consider the case where the modulated superconducting order is accompanied by one or more of the following : charge stripes , anti - phase spin stripes and an anti - phase modulated @xmath0-density wave ( ddw ) .        for the charge stripe phase",
    "we assume a site - centered , period-4 sinusoidal charge density @xmath12 .",
    "when spin stripe order is also present the boundaries of the charge unit - cells serve as anti - phase domain walls for an antiferromagnetic ( af ) spin order of the form @xmath13 .",
    "the combined charge - spin stripe configuration is depicted in fig .",
    "[ stripe ] , and the corresponding hamiltonian is described in appendix [ app : models ] .",
    "the uniform ddw state was proposed as a model for the pseudogap state in the underdoped cuprates@xcite .",
    "it describes a condensation of electron - hole pairs with non - zero angular momentum into a phase with staggered current loops . in the following we consider the anti - phase , period-8 , modulated version of this state as displayed in fig .",
    "note that current conservation has been incorporated into the model . for a detailed expressions of the order parameter and the mean field hamiltonian see appendix [ app : models ] .",
    "it is well known that the fermi - surface of a homogeneous @xmath0-wave superconductor consists of four nodal points .",
    "a very different behavior emerges in the case of an anti - phase modulated dsc , as shown by fig .",
    "[ lbco : fs ] .",
    "the figure exhibits the evolution of the fermi - surface of with increasing strength , @xmath14 , of the anti - phase modulated dsc , where the chemical potential was adjusted to maintain a 1/8 hole - doping level for each set of parameters .",
    "one can clearly see that the model supports an extended fermi - surface .",
    "as the amplitude @xmath14 increases , segments of the non - interacting fermi - surface near @xmath15 and symmetry related regions , become progressively gapped . at the same time the fermi - surface develops closed pockets which shrink with increasing",
    "@xmath14 and eventually disappear completely .",
    "the process proceeds until a single pocket remains when @xmath14 is of the order of the band - width .",
    "it then continues to shrink upon further increase of the dsc order .",
    "this behavior is generic as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ bscco : fs ] , where similar results are presented for . the rate at which the fermi - surface evolves , depends , however , on the band - structure .",

    ".),title=\"fig:\",width=326 ]    we believe that the origin of the fermi - surface can be traced to the formation of zero - energy andreev bound states on the anti - phase domain walls of the dsc order .",
    "a single junction between two phase - biased @xmath0-wave superconductors has been studied by tanaka and kashiwaya@xcite .",
    "they have calculated the quasiparticle ldos at the interface between the superconductors and demonstrated that for a @xmath1-phase shift the ldos displays a pronounced zero - bias peak , associated with zero - energy andreev bound states . the latter move to higher energies when the phase difference is tuned away from @xmath1 , and correspondingly the ldos exhibits a pseudo - gap behavior at low biases . in our model",
    "we consider a chain of such junctions and therefore must take into account the multiple scattering processes between them .",
    "we have not carried out a detailed analytical analysis of this problem .",
    "nevertheless , the numerical real - space structure of the zero - energy wavefunctions reveal that the states residing near the end - points of the open fermi - surface segments are indeed localized on the domain walls . on the other hand ,",
    "the zero - energy states on the fermi - pockets and away from these end points are approximately evenly distributed over the system .",
    "angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) is arguably the most suitable probe for detecting the extended fermi - surface .",
    "more generally , arpes measures the spectral function @xmath22 of the system . in figs .",
    "[ lbco : fs ] , [ bscco : fs ] we plot the distribution of low - energy spectral weight of an anti - phase modulated @xmath0-wave superconductor , namely the frequency integrated @xmath22 within a 20 mev lornetzian window centered at zero energy .",
    "as shown in the figures , the spectral weight lies predominantly along arcs in momentum space .",
    "as we increase the superconducting order the arcs shrink towards the bz diagonals . for the sinusoidal modulation studied here",
    "the distribution of spectral weight along the arcs is continuous .",
    "however , for a square - wave modulation , gaps open on the arcs at the boundaries of the reduced bz at @xmath23 and at points which are related to them by the modulation wavevector .     of a model of 1/8 hole - doped with an anti - phase modulated dsc of strength @xmath24.,width=316 ]    , as function of the amplitude , @xmath25 , of an additional homogeneous dsc component .",
    "the curve depicts the fermi - surface for the case @xmath26.,title=\"fig:\",width=320 ]        arpes can also provide a measurement of the momentum occupation function @xmath27 .",
    "it is this function which depicts most directly the presence of the closed segments , or `` pockets '' , in the fermi - surface .",
    "[ filling ] displays @xmath28 for the anti - phase modulated dsc in .",
    "while fermi - surface pockets in the normal state can always be classified as electron - like or hole - like , this is no longer true for the superconductor whose quasiparticles are linear combinations of both electrons and holes .",
    "however , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ filling ] , the pockets at @xmath29 and @xmath30 are close to being electron - like , while the pockets at @xmath31 are of the hole - like type .",
    "recently , much interest has been generated by the observation of shubnikov - de haas and de haas - van alphen oscillations in underdoped in strong magnetic fields which suppress superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the experimental results suggest that the fermi - surface contains coherent electron - like pockets .",
    "theoretical studies of non - superconducting spin - charge modulated phases have found evidence for electron @xcite and hole @xcite pockets .",
    "although unlikely to be relevant to the understanding of the aforementioned experiments , it would be interesting to investigate the impact of the pockets which we find in the anti - phase model , on the transport and magnetic properties of the system .",
    "we , however , did not pursue this direction .",
    "when a constant dsc component , of arbitrary small magnitude , is added to the anti - phase modulated system the fermi - surface changes dramatically and collapses onto nodal points . among them",
    "we always find the nodal points of the uniform @xmath0-wave superconductor along the diagonals of the bz .",
    "however , as demonstrated by fig .",
    "[ lbco : nodal ] , additional nodal points typically appear for not too large magnitude , @xmath25 , of the constant component .",
    "for the parameters used by us their spectral weight is about a half of the weight of the points along the diagonals . when @xmath25 is increased , the additional points move from the tips of the pockets , where they originate , towards the edge of the reduced bz where they disappear , while the points along the diagonals stay put .",
    "the number and positions of the nodal points vary as function of the strength of the modulated order and of the band - structure , but the general behavior remains the same . in the case of an in - phase modulated dsc we always find a fermi - surface which consists of the four nodal points of the uniform superconductor .",
    "this is not surprising since the in - phase modulated order can be represented approximately as an equal strength combination of anti - phase and constant components , for which , as seen in fig .",
    "[ lbco : nodal ] , the extra nodal points have long vanished .",
    "it is worth mentioning that while the change in the topology of the fermi - surface takes place even for an infinitesimal @xmath25 , the original fermi - surface of the anti - phase modulated system is only gapped by an amount of order @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , the low - energy spectral weight distribution of a system with weak additional homogeneous dsc is close to the one presented in figs .",
    "[ lbco : fs ] , [ bscco : fs ] .",
    "we have also studied the fermi - surface and the low - energy spectral weight in the presence of additional electronic orders , as described in section [ models ] . at large ,",
    "we have found that the coexisting orders do not change the general features outlined above .",
    "the fermi - surface of the in - phase modulated system is still comprised of the conventional @xmath32wave nodal points . the introduction of the orders into the anti - phase modulated superconductor does have some effect on the fermi - surface and the spectral weight distribution , as seen in fig .",
    "[ extra orders ] ( note that the reduced bz is halved in the presence of spin stripes or a modulated ddw . )",
    "most notably , we observe that the cdw order induce gaps on the fermi - surface at multiples of the ordering wavevector .",
    "although the shape of the fermi - surface is somewhat different , its extent is largely unaffected by the additional orders .",
    "this is also true for the general evolution of the fermi - surface with increasing @xmath14 and with the addition of a uniform dsc component .          .",
    "atom 0 is located on the symmetry axis of the stripe - the left most site in fig .",

    "[ real_ldos ] presents the density of states of the modulated superconducting states after averaging over the position in the sample .",
    "the energy dependence of the dos in the case of the in - phase modulated dsc is close to that of a uniform @xmath0-wave superconductor whose amplitude is given by the zero - wavevector component of the modulated order .",
    "in particular , the dos vanishes at zero - bias ( in order to simulate the finite energy resolution of the experiments we have introduced a 5 mev lorentzian broadening into our numerical calculation .",
    "this is the reason for the apparent zero - energy dos in the figure . )",
    "in contrast , the zero - energy dos of the anti - phase modulated system remains finite .",
    "we find that the low - energy behavior of the dos depends on the band - structure .",
    "for the dos contains a small dip at zero bias whose width does not scale with the strength of the modulated superconducting order , see fig .",
    "[ real_ldos ] . in on the other hand ( not shown here ) , there is a more pronounced dip which does scale with @xmath14 . in both cases",
    "the low - energy dos decreases when @xmath14 is increased , in agreement with the reduction in the extent of the fermi - surface , as described above .",
    "although the unit - cell in the anti - phase superconducting system is composed of 8 sites , the real space periodicity of the ldos is halved , as shown in fig .",
    "this is a result of the symmetries of the model . translating the system by 4 lattice constants is equivalent to the change @xmath33 , which does not affect the ldos , as long as the average pairing potential is zero .",
    "an additional constant dsc component breaks this symmetry , opens a @xmath0-wave gap in the ldos , and reverts its period to 8 sites .",
    "consequently , the first non - vanishing fourier component of the ldos , ( @xmath34 ) , in both the in - phase and the pure anti - phase modulated models is at @xmath35 .",
    "its energy dependence is shown in fig .",
    "[ half_pi ] . while for the in - phase model it exhibits a symmetric structure around zero bias within the low - voltage regime , such symmetry",

    "the addition of electronic orders to the superconducting system does not change the main features described above .",
    "zero - bias spectral weight is still observed in the anti - phase dsc model and is absent in the in - phase system .",
    "the periodicity of the ldos is also unaffected by the cdw and the ddw orders , while the spin - stripe order introduces new fourier components at multiples of @xmath36 .      in recent years , scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements of the ft - ldos have become a much - used tool in the quest for identifying unconventional electronic orders in the cuprates @xcite .",
    "we have calculated the effects of quasiparticle scattering off a single impurity on the ft - ldos in a system with modulated superconductivity . to this end",
    "we have implemented the t - matrix approximation , as described in appendix [ app : sts ] .",

    "the positions in @xmath42-space of many of the remaining peaks may be associated with wavevectors connecting high zero - energy ldos regions of the clean system @xcite .",
    "this is especially true for the case with additional homogeneous dsc where the zero - energy spectral weight appears at isolated nodal points .",
    "we were able to identify , as shown in fig .",
    "[ sts - figure ] , peaks which are associated with scattering between the nodal points of the homogeneous @xmath0-wave superconductors , as well as peaks which originate from scattering between the extra nodal points that are induced by the presence of the modulated dsc order , see fig .",

    "it is more difficult to trace the root of the peaks in the ft - ldos of the pure modulated system , since it possesses an extended fermi - surface .",
