    "technological advances in the fabrication of quantum wires and carbon nanotube systems with a high tunability nowadays allows the controlled study of such strong correlation phenomena,@xcite see ref .   for a recent review .",
    "while transport and spectroscopic properties of quantum wires in the luttinger liquid regime have been the subject of much attention over the years both experimentally@xcite and theoretically,@xcite much less is known outside this regime where a description solely in terms of a luttinger liquid becomes insufficient .",
    "this is , in particular , the case close to quantum phase transitions at which the number of fermi points changes and , consequently , a fermi energy @xmath3 vanishes . in the approximation of a non - interacting electron gas , these transitions",
    "are directly reflected as rounded steps in the conductance,@xcite @xmath4 , that sharpen up as the temperature @xmath5 decreases .",
    "the influence of electron - electron interactions close to these transitions is , however , only partially understood.@xcite it is important to realize that the limits @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the approach to the quantum phase transition do not commute , and , in particular , the critical conductance @xmath8 is governed by the underlying quantum critical point.@xcite as a fermi energy @xmath3 vanishes at the transition , one necessarily enters a regime where temperature @xmath5 is larger than characteristic energy scales of the electron liquid and , as a result , phenomena beyond a luttinger liquid description become important .",
    "close to the quantum phase transition , one can distinguish two characteristic energy scales , namely the fermi energy @xmath3 for charge excitations and the spin exchange constant @xmath9 for spin excitations .",
    "the intermediate temperature range @xmath10 , where the charge sector still sustains plasmon excitations while the spin sector is already incoherent , has caught some attention recently.@xcite it was pointed out by matveev@xcite that in this spin - incoherent regime the conductance should qualitatively deviate from the prediction for the non - interacting electron gas , which might explain additional features in the conductance of quantum wires observed experimentally.@xcite    in the present work , we consider the quantum phase transition from a strictly one - dimensional electron liquid to a quasi - one - dimensional state with the aim to identify the nature , i.e. , the universality class , of the transition at @xmath11 . in the absence of any interaction , the electrons form subbands whose separation is controlled by the confining potential .",

    "it was shown by balents@xcite that the residual couplings of the dressed fermions to the luttinger liquid are irrelevant at the transition . a peculiarity of this transition concerns processes where pairs of electrons are transfered between the two subbands.@xcite",
    "although such processes do not influence the nature of the transition , they determine in fact the ground state for a finite density of polarons , i.e. , pair - tunneling is _ dangerously _ irrelevant at the critical point .",
    "as polarons start populating the second subband , the system can gain energy by pair - tunneling and , as a result , a bcs - like gap opens up as a secondary effect . as a result of the dangerously irrelevant pair - tunneling operator ,",
    "the lifshitz transition thus separates two c1 phases in the notation of ref .   that possess only a single gapless charge mode .    as the interaction strength increases , the universality class of the transition , however , changes . for strong interactions , @xmath13 , a one - dimensional wigner crystal forms , and the transition corresponds to the splitting of the crystal into two rows with a zigzag arrangement of the electrons , see fig .",

    "the residual coupling between the ising critical degrees of freedom and the plasmon excitations leads to logarithmic corrections to ising criticality , that were analyzed in ref .  .",
    "although this coupling turns out to be marginally irrelevant , the renormalization group ( rg ) flow generates an enhanced su(2 ) symmetry as the velocities of the plasmons and the ising critical degrees of freedom approach each other in the low - energy limit .",

    "this could , in turn , make the pair - tunneling relevant , resulting in an instability .",
    "however , in our case the criterion for this second scenario of run - away flow is even weaker than eq .  .",
    "thus , we conclude that in the regime @xmath330 the ground state of two luttinger liquids in the two subbands is stable .",
    "so far , we discussed all regimes in fig .",
    "[ fig : bands ] close to the phase transition except the one for finite positive but small chemical potential , @xmath373 .",

    "whereas in the regime of small and negative @xmath12 of section [ subsec : impenetrpol ] a theoretical description in terms of only two interacting particles within the second subband was sufficient , now a finite density of strongly - interacting electrons populate the second subband which eludes a perturbative description .",
    "as the charge sector of the impenetrable electron gas corresponds to a spinless fermi gas,@xcite we can only speculate that the physics within this strongly - interacting regime shares certain similarities with a system of spinless fermions .",
    "in a two - subband system of _ spinless _ fermions , one generically finds an instability for small but finite @xmath12 because pair - tunneling becomes relevant and leads to the opening of a gap.@xcite the main reason is that , for the spinless case , the intra - subband interaction of the weakly populated second subband is of order @xmath374 due to the pauli principle , whereas pair - tunneling is only suppressed by a factor @xmath375 , namely @xmath376 . as a result",
    ", the orthogonality catastrophe arising from adding particles to or removing particles from the second subband is substantially weakened : the rg flow does no longer contain terms of order @xmath357 as in eqs .   while the remaining terms make the pair - tunneling marginally relevant .",
    "the flow of the pair - tunneling to strong coupling signals the appearance of a gap due to a locking of the relative charge mode .",
    "importantly , for spinless fermions there does not exist any energy scale @xmath223 that limits the range of validity of the perturbative rg in contrast to eqs .  .",
    "it is not unlikely that a similar kind of relevant pair - tunneling mechanism might be at work in the spinfull case as well in the regime @xmath373 where the physics is already influenced by the impenetrable electron gas fixed - point , maybe giving rise to a gap in the charge sector .",
    "we analyzed the quantum phase transition in a quantum wire from a one - dimensional to a quasi - one - dimensional state assuming that electrons interact via a long - range coulomb potential screened by a nearby gate .",
    "the model of the quantum wire was defined in section  [ model ] , and a mean - field phase diagram was presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    in the limit of strong interactions , @xmath13 ,",
    "the ground state is determined by the charge degrees of freedom .",
    "the charges minimize the coulomb energy by forming a wigner crystal .",
    "exchange processes between electrons give rise to an exponentially small exchange coupling between the spins so that the spin sector is well approximated by the nearest - neighbor heisenberg model .",
    "the phonons of the wigner crystal and the spin excitations of the heisenberg model thus account for a gapless charge and spin mode in the one - dimensional limit giving rise to a c1s1 phase in the notation of ref .  .",
    "at the transition to a quasi - one - dimensional state , the 1d wigner crystal deforms and splits into two rows , see section  [ wigner crystal quantum wire ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : transition](b ) .",
    "the transition is characterized by a ( non - local ) ising order parameter .",
    "the exponentially small spin exchange between nearest neighbors depends sensitively on the distance between charges which results in a magnetoelastic coupling between the spin and phonon excitations of the wigner crystal .",
    "we found that due to the ising symmetry the spin exchange can only couple inefficiently to the square of the order parameter so that the universality class of the transition remains unaffected by the spin sector .",
    "as a consequence , the analysis of the spin - polarized case also applies here,@xcite and the transition is an ising transition with logarithmic corrections resulting from the coupling of the critical ising modes to the longitudinal phonons .",
    "although this latter coupling was found to be marginally irrelevant , its rg flow leads to an enhanced su(2 ) symmetry accompanied by a suppression of the velocity of the excitations.@xcite right after the transition to a deformed zigzag wigner crystal , the resulting state possesses a single gapless longitudinal phonon and a gapless spin mode , corresponding to a c1s1 phase . if the electron density increases further , the fate of the spin sector depends on the strength of ring exchange processes.@xcite    in the limit of weak interactions , @xmath14 , the transition can be analyzed in terms of a two - subband model of interacting electrons , see section  [ multiband quantum wire ] . in the one - dimensional limit ,",
    "only the lowest subband is filled , forming a luttinger liquid with a gapless charge and a gapless spin mode , i.e. , it is a c1s1 phase . as the density increases ,",
    "a second subband starts being populated , see fig .",
    "[ fig : transition](a ) .",
    "this quantum phase transition is characterized by an interplay of charge and spin degrees of freedom and , more importantly , multiple dynamical scales.@xcite the luttinger liquid within the first filled subband is lorentz - invariant and thus has a dynamical exponent @xmath218 .",
    "the electrons in the empty second subband , on the other hand , are characterized by galilean invariance and the dynamical exponent is @xmath219 . as explicitly shown in section [ subsec : pert ] ,",
    "the presence of two dynamical exponents is reflected in divergences in perturbation theory of different strengths .",
    "whereas perturbative corrections involving excitations of the luttinger liquid are accompanied by ubiquitous logarithms , the corrections involving electron - electron polarizations in the second subband are more singular and diverge as the inverse square - root of energy .",
    "indeed , the electrons at the bottom of the second subband are strongly interacting .",
    "this is best understood by considering the dimensionless coupling @xmath377 , which diverges at the band bottom due to the diverging one - dimensional density of states @xmath205 . as a result ,",
    "the scattering between two electrons of different spin polarizations is unitary , and the electrons become impenetrable .",
    "we found that this emergent impenetrability in fact stabilizes the luttinger liquid in the filled subband for the following reason .",
    "the system is able to gain energy by pair - tunneling processes of electrons with different spin polarizations from the filled first into the second empty subband .",
    "this effectively generates an attractive interaction in the luttinger liquid that increases the tendency towards the formation of a spin gap .",
    "however , due to the emergent unitary scattering the probability to find two electrons at the same position in space decreases dramatically and pair - tunneling between the subbands becomes inefficient .",
    "we showed that for electrons interacting via a screened coulomb potential the gapless spin excitations within the first subband survive at the transition , because the bare pair - tunneling between the subbands is weaker than the intra - subband interaction , see the criterion in eq .  .",
    "this is in contrast to the two - chain hubbard model where both couplings are of the same order and pair - tunneling promotes the formation of bound electron pairs.@xcite we showed in section  [ subsec : balentsfisher ] that the stability criterion of eq .",
    ", that embodies the competition between intra - subband interaction and pair - tunneling , can be attributed to a stationary , i.e. , a repulsive approximate fixed - point of the renormalization group flow .",
    "in addition , we found similarly as in the spinless case that the impenetrable electrons are screened by plasmon and spinon excitations in the first subband .",
    "the quantum phase transition at weak interactions is , thus , identified as a lifshitz transition in terms of impenetrable polarons .",
    "we were not able to identify the phase and , in particular , the number of gapless modes for a small but finite filling of the second subband , because close to the lifshitz transition the physics is still strongly influenced by the strong coupling fixed - point of the impenetrable electron gas that is beyond a perturbative treatment .",
    "we conjecture that  similarly to the spinless case @xcite  pair - tunneling processes might play here an important role as well , maybe reducing the number of gapless modes .",
    "we conjecture that pair - tunneling processes  similar as in the spinless case@xcite  might play here an important role as well , maybe reducing the number of gapless modes .",
    "if the density is further increased and the filling of the second subband is sufficiently large , the interactions can again be treated perturbatively and the filled two subbands form two decoupled luttinger liquids ( though not in the original basis ) with two gapless charge and spin modes , i.e. , a c2s2 phase .",
    "another open question concerns the connection between the strong and the weak coupling limit .",
    "there should exist a multicritical point at intermediate densities that separates the ising transition for @xmath13 from the lifshitz transition encountered at weak coupling , @xmath14 .",
