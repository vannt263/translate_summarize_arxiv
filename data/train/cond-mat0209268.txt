    "in recent years a considerable research effort has been expended to understand the complex phenomenology of supercooled liquids and glasses .",
    "mode - coupling theory has proved quite successful for supercooled liquids at higher temperatures , before activated dynamics must be accounted for explicitly.@xcite it was goldstein who first related the behaviour of glass formers to the underlying potential energy surface ( pes ) .",
    "@xcite in this approach , the dynamics are separated into vibrational motion about a minimum on the pes and transitions between local minima or ` inherent structures'.@xcite the pes is partitioned into basins of attraction surrounding the local minima , where a basin of attraction is defined as a set of points that lead to the same minimum along steepest - descent pathways .",
    "recently , it has been possible to establish connections between the structure , dynamics and thermodynamics of finite systems and the pes in some detail.@xcite    following angell,@xcite glass - forming liquids can be classified as strong or fragile .",
    "fragile systems exhibit non - arrhenius temperature dependence of transport properties such as the diffusion constant , usually accompanied by a significant heat capacity peak at the glass transition .",
    "in contrast , strong systems exhibit arrhenius dynamics and small or negligible changes in the thermodynamic properties at the glass transition . computer simulation based on standard molecular dynamics ( md ) or monte carlo ( mc ) techniques , has played a significant role in the testing and development of models for supercooled liquids and glasses.@xcite interest in more direct connections to the pes has recently increased , with sastry , debenedetti and stillinger@xcite characterising ` landscape - influenced ' and ` landscape - dominated ' regimes for a binary lennard - jones system , in agreement with the instantaneous normal modes picture of donati , sciortino and tartaglia.@xcite recently , a kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) approach@xcite was used to provide an alternative view of the dynamics.@xcite    in the present contribution we focus on some properties of the energy landscape in a binary lennard - jones ( blj ) mixture , namely , the effect of the density on the local minima sampled as a function of temperature .",
    "this topic has been previously considered by malandro et al.@xcite and sastry.@xcite in the former studies the volume dependence of the local minima appearances and disappearances were examined .",
    "similar results were found by heuer@xcite .",
    "sastry also analysed the relationship between fragility and the pes and how the former depends on the bulk density .",
    "one feature of the blj system is that the vibrational contribution to the entropy , within the harmonic approximation , decreases with the potential energy .",
    "furthermore , sastry found a limiting density , @xmath5 in reduced units , which defines a limit of stability separating spatially heterogeneous structures ( below @xmath4 ) from more homogeneous structures ( above @xmath4 ) .",
    "@xmath4 was also interpreted as a density limit to glass formation . here",
    ", we concentrate on this limit and consider the glass and supercooled liquid structures in more detail as a function of density .",
    "the model we used is a binary mixture of @xmath6 atoms in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions , containing 205 ( @xmath7 ) a atoms and 51 ( @xmath8 ) b atoms interacting according to a lennard - jones pair potential of the form @xmath9,\\ ] ] @xmath10 being the distance between particles @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the values of the lennard - jones parameters are @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18.@xcite the units of distance , energy , temperature , pressure , and time were taken as @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is the boltzmann constant ) , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , with @xmath25 the mass of both a and b atoms .",
    "the initial density was @xmath26 with a fixed cutoff of @xmath27 along with the minimum image convention .",
    "we truncated and shifted the potential with a quadratic function , so that the energy and its first derivative are continuous at the cutoff value.@xcite    this blj model has been extensively studied in the glasses community , as it does not crystallise on the molecular dynamics time scale.@xcite however , we have recently found that there are crystalline minima for this system , based on face - centred - cubic a atoms with trigonal or square prismatic b - a coordination.@xcite previous work has shown that this system exhibits a significant degree of non - arrhenius behaviour at low temperatures , i.e. it is fragile in angell s terminology.@xcite    microcanonical molecular dynamics simulations were carried out , where the classical equations of motion were integrated using a verlet algorithm .",
    "we employed 10@xmath28 equilibration steps , followed by 10@xmath29 data collection steps with a time step of 0.003 in reduced units.@xcite    in order to study the local minima the instantaneous system configuration was quenched , every 1000th configuration , to locate a minimum .",
    "quenching was performed using a modified version of nocedal s limited memory broyden - fletcher - goldfarb - shanno ( l - bfgs ) algorithm.@xcite each quench was finished using a few eigenvector - following steps@xcite to converge the root - mean - square gradient below @xmath30 reduced units , employing full diagonalisation of the analytical hessian matrix to ensure that the stationary points have the correct hessian index ( the number of negative eigenvalues ) . in this manner we generated a sample of minima at density @xmath31 .    for each local minimum ,",
    "the density of the system was changed by 0.02 in reduced units . to do this we changed the box length to give the density required , without rescaling the coordinates of the atoms in the box .",
    "then , the potential energy was reminimized using the methods described above .",
    "this process was repeated in order to follow the properties of the minima over a wide range of density .",
    "we have analysed the behaviour of the local minima at densities in the range @xmath32 , and for three different initial kinetic equipartition temperatures",
    "@xmath33 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "it is known for this system that the glass transition temperature , @xmath34 , occurs between 0.5 and 0.4.@xcite",
    "in this section we present the results obtained for the behaviour of the local minima at different temperatures and densities . at the initial density @xmath31 , the number of different local minima that we found from the 1000 instantaneous configurations , @xmath35 , was @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 at @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "these values reflect the increasing residence times in the local minima as the temperature is decreased , with a dramatic fall in @xmath35 below @xmath34 .",
    "we found that @xmath35 is basically independent of the density in the range of densities studied .",
    "we have also evaluated the mean potential energy for the local minima as a function of density for three different initial samples at @xmath0 , 0.5 and 0.4 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] we can see how the lowest value of the energy occurs around @xmath31 for each temperature .",
    "however , at @xmath39 the minimum of the curve is slightly displaced to higher density , namely , to @xmath40 .",
    "a clear change of slope appears in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] ( the system is mechanically unstable ) at @xmath3 for each temperature , and for @xmath41 the mean potential energy is practically independent of @xmath42 and increases as the density decreases .",
    "another interesting property is the variation of the pressure with density ( fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] ) . in this case , the pressure , @xmath43 , was calculated using the virial equation@xcite",
    "@xmath44    where @xmath45 is the volume of the supercell , @xmath46 is the number of atoms , @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the force on the _ i_th particle due to _ j_th particle .",
    "a factor @xmath49 appears because of momentum conservation .",
    "we used @xmath50 to calculate the pressure for the local minima .",
    "the lowest value of @xmath43 is reached for each temperature around @xmath3 .",
    "this value is very close to sastry s result of @xmath5@xcite ( his supercell contained 204 a atoms and 52 b atoms ) . for @xmath51 , the mean pressure is practically independent of the temperature .",
    "[ fig : energy ] also shows that the pressure is nearly zero at densities corresponding to the lowest values of the mean energy .",
    "the geometric mean normal mode frequency at each local minimum is    @xmath52    where the @xmath53 are obtained by diagonalising the hessian matrix .",
    "a mean angular frequency , averaged over all the local minima , can be defined as    @xmath54    and this quantity is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : freqdist ] .",
    "the frequencies are important for dynamics because they appear in the usual transition state theory rate constant for barrier crossing .",
    "if we also use the information obtained in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] we can see that for @xmath55 , which corresponds to positive pressures ( compressed regime ) , @xmath56 increases with energy , in agreement with sastry.@xcite however , between @xmath57 and @xmath3 , which corresponds to negative pressures ( stretched regime ) , we see the opposite behaviour , i.e.  @xmath56 decreases as the density decreases . then , it increases again to reach a constant value of 13 below @xmath58 independent of @xmath42 .",
    "we have also calculated the mean value of the distance between all pairs of local minima sampled :    @xmath59    where @xmath60 and @xmath61 indicates the @xmath60th and @xmath61th local minima .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : freqdist ] that this quantity increases with the initial temperature used to generate the samples and with decreasing density . on the other hand , the initial md trajectories sample the pes less extensively at low temperature for the same simulation time . in the regime",
    "@xmath62 @xmath63 does not change much , while below @xmath3 it increases steadily .",
    "the above results were checked by studying the partial radial distribution functions ( prdf ) for all the local minima sampled,@xcite    @xmath64    and @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the delta function . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rdfa ] we show the prdf for a particles as a function of the density for reoptimised local minima generated from the run at @xmath67 .",
    "the first peak is the highest in the prdf for all densities , indicating that the aa correlation takes place at the first coordination shell .",
    "however , as the density is reduced from @xmath68 , this peak is slightly displaced to longer distance , i.e. it reflects the lower density , and then reaches a maximum value at density @xmath3 . below this density ,",
    "the system shows the opposite trend due to the formation of voids and fractures,@xcite , allowing the aa distances to relax back closer to their ideal value .",
    "similar behaviour is exhibited in @xmath69 in fig .",
    "[ fig : rdfa ] . the strong attractive interaction between a and b particles",
    "is reflected in the first peak .",
    "however , @xmath70 in fig .",
    "[ fig : rdfb ] exhibits some new features .",
    "the weaker attractive interaction between b particles is reflected in the intensities of the peaks .",
    "the bb correlation takes place mainly in the first , second and third coordination shells , but for @xmath71 the first coordination shell is more important .",
    "furthermore , a clear splitting appears in the second peak , indicating that the local structure for b particles is more ordered at low density .",
    "this is because at low density , with the formation of voids in the structure , a dense packing appears .",
    "a similar signature is known at high pressure.@xcite    sastry et al.@xcite suggested that the limiting density , in our case @xmath3 , is a lower limit to glass formation . in order to elucidate this signature",
    "we compare the prdf averaged over reoptimised local minima initially sampled at @xmath72 and @xmath39 .",
    "the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : rdfaac ] reveal a clear difference between the two samples for densities above @xmath3 . for the lower temperature , corresponding to the glassy phase , the structure is more ordered .",
    "however , below @xmath3 the prdf are nearly the same , so it is not possible to differentiate between the glass and supercooled liquid structures in this way .",
    "similar behaviour is exhibited by @xmath70 in fig .",
    "[ fig : rdfbbc ] .",
    "however , @xmath69 , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rdfaac ] , does not separate the two phases , indicating that the a - b disorder is similar in the glass and the supercooled liquid .",
    "the formation of a void in one particular local minimum sampled at @xmath67 is shown in figure [ fig : config_void ] .",
    "the void starts to form at the limiting density @xmath3 and then increases when the density is reduced further .",
    "in this paper we have considered the effect of the density on local minima of a binary lennard - jones system sampled at kinetic equipartition temperatures @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . a limiting density is found around @xmath3 , below which fractures and voids begin to form .",
    "the latter features cause discontinuities in various properties , in agreement with sastry s results.@xcite    in the regime @xmath62 the main peaks in the prdf for aa , bb , and ab particles are slightly displaced to longer distance relative to @xmath68 . below @xmath4 , fractures and voids begin to form and the main peaks then move in the opposite direction . in the prdf for bb particles at low density , a clear splitting of",
    "the second peak appears as a consequence of a more ordered local structure .",
    "furthermore , below @xmath4 , the prdf for aa , bb and ab particles for the samples generated at @xmath72 and @xmath39 are indistinguishable , so it is not possible to differentiate between the glass and supercooled liquid structures at low density in this way .",
    "the lowest value of the mean pressure also occurs around @xmath4 for each temperature . below this density , the mean potential energy changes almost linearly with @xmath73 due to a transition from homogeneous local minima to inhomogeneous structures with voids.@xcite the minimum of the mean energy potential as a function of the density corresponds to a pressure close to zero .    on the other hand , at positive pressure ( compressed region ) , we found that the mean normal mode frequencies increase with energy but , at negative pressure ( stretched region ) , the opposite behaviour appears . at lower density , the mean",
    "frequency is practically the same for samples obtained at each temperature , and reaches a limiting value as the density decreases .    the initial md trajectories sample fewer local minima at low temperature , as expected .",
