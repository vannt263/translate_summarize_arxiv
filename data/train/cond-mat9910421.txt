    "auger - electron spectroscopy ( aes ) and the complementary appearance - potential spectroscopy ( aps ) have become valuable tools for investigating the electronic structure of solids and solid surfaces  @xcite .",
    "they represent highly element specific and non - destructive methods with a comparatively simple experimental set up . the auger line shape from a core - valence - valence ( cvv ) process yields information on the occupied part of the valence band , while the aps provides insight into the unoccupied valence states .",
    "however , much effort has been spent on the detailed interpretation of the spectra .",
    "+ lander  @xcite suggested that the spectrum obtained by aes ( aps ) is given as the self - convolution of the occupied ( unoccupied ) valence density of states ( dos ) . on the other hand",
    ", powell  @xcite discovered the cvv auger line shape of ag to behave `` anomalously '' in the sense of lander s self - convolution model .",
    "these anomalous features are by now well known to be caused by correlation effects dominating the electronic properties of various solids . therefore , aes ( aps ) seems to be a useful technique to study electron - correlation effects , but it is doubtful whether it is able to compete with one - particle spectroscopies , such as photoemission ( inverse photoemission ) , in deriving the dos by deconvolution .",
    "+ in the theoretical treatment of the cvv auger process , there are mainly two problems .",
    "the first one is to take into account the correlation effects . here",
    "one may distinguish between the _ direct _ and _ indirect _ correlations .",
    "the direct correlations describe the correlations of those electrons which participate in the auger process .",
    "they are responsible for the most prominent effects in the auger line shape as compared to the self - convolution .",
    "on the other hand , the indirect correlations among the electrons in the rest system manifest themselves in the quasi - particle density of states ( qdos ) as a renormalisation of the one - particle dos .",
    "+ the second problem is the calculation of the transition - matrix elements for the auger process as well as the scattering of the outgoing auger electron ( cf .  refs .  ) .",
    "these effects will ( slightly ) modify the bare line shape and may become important for a refined interpretation of experimental data . within the present paper ,",
    "however , we set aside this second problem and like to concentrate on electron - correlation effects in aes from ferromagnetic 3d - transition metals .",
    "+ within the framework of the single - band hubbard model , correlation effects can be treated exactly for systems with completely filled or empty bands , as was first shown by cini and sawatzky  @xcite .",
    "the generalisation to the case of degenerate bands was introduced in ref .   and",
    "further analysed in ref .",
    ", for example . these results may also be extended to include the core - valence interaction  @xcite .",
    "+ considering the more general case of partially filled bands introduces several complications concerning the indirect as well as the direct correlations . for the indirect valence - valence correlations there is a number of approximation schemes applicable to a multi - band hubbard model .",
    "a method which reproduces the experimentally observed curie temperature quite well , especially for ni , is the spectral density approach  @xcite .",
    "other approaches are , for example , the generalisation of the single - band modified perturbation theory  @xcite to the multi - band model  @xcite and quantum - monte - carlo simulations  @xcite in connection with the dynamical mean - field theory  @xcite .",
    "however , these methods suffer from some necessary restrictions concerning the completeness of the coulomb - matrix .",
    "this is not the case for the fluctuation exchange  @xcite and the hubbard  i approximation  @xcite , for example . for a more detailed discussion on the indirect valence - valence correlations",
    "see ref .  .",
    "+ for the treatment of the direct correlations , one has the exact - diagonalisation method  @xcite for small systems and the equation - of - motion method  @xcite with its in general uncontrolled termination of the hierarchy of the equations of motion .",
    "another approximate solution is the valence - valence ladder ( vv ladder ) approximation  @xcite and its generalisation to include the core - valence interaction  @xcite ( cvv ladder ) . in particular",
    "one has to account for the broken translational symmetry in the initial state of aes , caused by the presence of the core hole and its screening due to the valence electrons . in the final state",
    "this interaction is responsible for the sudden response of the valence electrons due to the destruction of the core hole . in the limit of completely filled or empty bands the ladder approximations",
    "recover the above - mentioned exact solution .    here",
    "the interaction strength is taken as the control parameter , which is correct in the weak - coupling regime .",
    "we are aware that this method has restrictions for the 3d - transition metals .",
    "however , in this work we prefer a common treatment of one - particle spectroscopies ( photoemission and inverse photoemission ) and two - particle spectroscopies like aes . to be concrete , we will use the second - order perturbation theory around the hartree - fock solution  @xcite for the indirect valence - valence correlations .",
    "the direct correlations will be treated by applying two different methods , i.e.  the vv ladder approximation and the first - order perturbation theory in the valence - valence and core - valence interaction .",
    "+ within this approach it is possible to include a realistic one - particle input taken from tight - binding band - structure calculations .",
    "we do not only account for the degeneracy of the 3d - band but also for the hybridisation with the 4s and 4p states .",
    "the theory is formulated and evaluated for a non - orthogonal basis set where the states can be distinguished by the angular momentum quantum number and the cubic harmonic index .",
    "this facilitates the interpretation of the resulting spectra .",
    "furthermore , we do not restrict ourselves to correlations among the final - state holes only and include core - hole effects from the very beginning .",
    "this implies the necessity for a proper treatment of the initial state where the core - hole screening breaks the translational symmetry .",
    "the theory is implemented numerically and evaluated for ferromagnetic ni .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in the next section",
    "we will introduce the model under consideration . in section  [ sec : auger ]",
    "we give the expression for the auger intensity .",

    "assume complete screening , i.e.  charge neutrality at the site @xmath42 , which is reasonable especially for 3d - transition metals because the screening time scale is small compared to the life - time of the core hole  @xcite .",

    "+ as one can see in the plots on the left - hand side , the vv interaction is too weak to produce bound states , no sharp satellite appears , and the spectra appear to be band - like . compared to the self - convolution ( a ) , however , a considerable shift to lower energies is observed in ( b ) .",
    "this shift results from the direct correlations between the two final - state holes in the valence band . in ( c )",
    "the main peak is shifted to still lower energies .",
    "this is an effect of the core - hole screening in the initial state and can be traced back to the redistribution of spectral weight in the screened qdos ( figure  [ fig : qdosju02 ] ) .",
    "compared to ( a ) and ( b ) , the total aes intensity is clearly increased in ( c ) .",
    "again this is a consequence of the core - hole screening since the number of occupied states available for the auger process is increased ( figure  [ fig : qdosju02 ] , r.h.s . ) .",
    "the spectrum shown in ( d ) not only includes the initial - state core - hole screening but the final - state effects due to the destruction of the core hole .",
    "compared to ( c ) , where the initial state is described in the same way , these effects result in a strong shift of the main peak to higher energies .",
    "this shift almost exactly compensates the shifts to lower energies that are due to direct vv correlations ( b ) and the core - hole screening ( c ) .",
    "however , a weak shoulder at about @xmath159ev remains in the spectrum ( d ) .",
    "+    in all cases there is a high spin asymmetry ( up to @xmath160% ) for energies between approximately @xmath161ev and 0 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that ni is a strong ferromagnet .",
    "there are almost no @xmath117-electrons above about @xmath162ev ( see figure  [ fig : qdosju02 ] ) that can participate in the auger - process .",
    "the main contribution to the intensity is therefore due to triplet configurations where the two final - state holes or , equivalently , core - hole and auger electron have spin@xmath119 .",
    "however , the intensity is very small in this energy region . by taking into account the screening of the core hole in the initial state ( compare ( b ) and ( c ) ) the spin asymmetry",
    "is reduced over the whole energy range which essentially is the same effect as the reduction of the local magnetic moment at @xmath42 caused by the presence of the core hole ( figure  [ fig : mcju02 ] ) .",
    "the total spin - polarisation @xmath163 in the case ( d ) is 2.6% and 1.6% for ( c ) .",
    "both values are close to the experimental value  @xcite of 2% for the @xmath164-process .",
    "the cases ( a ) and ( b ) with a polarisation of 8.7% and 9.3% , respectively , overestimate the total spin - polarisation compared with the experimental value .",
    "+    for the calculation of the orbitally resolved contributions to the auger intensity we may restrict the summation in equation ( [ eq : augerint ] ) to orbital indices ( @xmath165 ) belonging to @xmath116(@xmath120)-character only .",
    "the resulting contributions are shown on the left ( right ) of figure  [ fig : aespt0 ] .",
    "the contributions due to the remaining terms are plotted in the middle .",
    "+ in all cases ( a)(b ) the @xmath116 contributions are clearly stronger compared with the @xmath120 contributions .",
    "the ratio between the @xmath116 and @xmath120 partial intensities corresponds to the different degeneracies . comparing the cases ( a)(d ) ,",
    "we notice that there are essentially the same trends in the partial intensities as for the total intensities , and the discussion is the same as above .",
    "the line shape in case ( d ) , however , shows up some fine structure , especially in the @xmath116 partial intensity , which is not that pronounced in the total intensity .",
    "the shoulder at the low - energy tail of ( d ) is due to direct vv correlations and may be interpreted as a hint for the formation of a bound state of the final holes . except for this shoulder ,",
    "a surprising similarity between ( d ) and ( a ) is noticed , even for the orbital resolved spectra .",
    "this might also be due to the small number of diagrams taken into account .",
    "however , the cancellation of effects according to different interactions ( vv and cv ) was also pointed out in ref .  .",
    "in this paper we have investigated electron - correlation effects on the auger line shape of ni as an example of a ferromagnetic 3d - transition metal .",
    "the starting point is a realistic set of hopping and overlap parameters taken from tight - binding band - structure calculations .",
    "we additionally consider a strongly screened on - site coulomb interaction between the rather localised 3d electrons .",
    "the respective coulomb - matrix elements are expressed in terms of effective slater integrals . choosing a non - orthogonal basis , a distinction between the different angular - momentum characters of the valence orbitals is possible .",
    "this is necessary for the precise definition of the coulomb - interaction part in the ( multi - band hubbard ) hamiltonian and also facilitates the interpretation of the auger spectra .",
    "furthermore , we account for the core - valence interaction which is responsible for the screening of the core hole in the initial state of aes and for the sudden response of the valence electrons due to the destruction of the core hole in the final state .    within a diagrammatic approach , the indirect and",
    "the direct correlations can be studied separately .",
    "the indirect correlations have been treated by second - order perturbation theory around the hartree - fock solution ( sopt - hf ) .",
    "the vv interaction parameters are fixed by assuming a ratio @xmath105 and by fitting the experimentally observed magnetic moment for @xmath104k , leading to @xmath100ev and @xmath101ev .",
    "this is equivalent to an intra - orbital interaction of @xmath166ev ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "the resulting curie temperature within the theory presented here is by a factor 2.6 larger than the experimentally observed one but considerably lower than the lda+@xmath37 ( hartree - fock ) value .",
    "+ the core - valence interaction leads to a breakdown of the translational invariance in the initial state for aes .",
    "the interaction parameter @xmath110ev is fixed be requiring charge neutrality at the site @xmath42 where the core hole is created .",
    "the screening of the additional core - hole potential causes a transfer of spectral weight below the fermi energy and thus a considerable reduction of the local magnetic moment .",
    "however , the local magnetic moment is finite since the s- and p - electrons also contribute to the screening .    to study the direct correlations we have used two different approaches .",
    "the first is the vv ladder approximation , which results in a band - like auger spectrum with a single maximum . in a second approach",
    "we have summed up the first - order diagrams with respect to the vv and cv interaction .",
    "the resulting spectrum shows up a shoulder at the lower tail due to the vv interaction .",
    "otherwise the line shape is very similar to that obtained by the self - convolution of the unscreened qdos . +",
    "as far as concerns the line shape , we conclude that the different correlation effects , vv and cv correlations in the initial and the final state , nearly cancel .",
    "however , a strong effect of electron correlations has been found in the orbitally resolved partial intensities and particularly for the spin - asymmetry .",
    "the calculated spin polarisation is in a good agreement with the measured one of the @xmath164-process  @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the excitation of a not too deep lying core level , i.e.  the two - step model should be applicable .",
    "the reduced but finite spin polarisation of the @xmath164-process ( as compared to the band polarisation ) can be explained by effects of core - hole screening rather than by a core - hole polarisation , caused by a resonant excitation of the core electron into the valence band  @xcite .",
    "future work will show whether these findings also apply to other 3d - transition metals .",
    "financial support of the _ deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft _ within the project no .",
    "158/5 - 1 is greatfully acknowledged .",
    "the numerical calculations were performed on the crayt3e at the _ konrad - zuse - zentrum fr informationstechnologie berlin ( zib)_.",
    "there are several advantages for using the non - orthogonal basis set @xmath168 .",
    "the slater - koster parameters  @xcite for the two - center approximation ( used here ) are much more accurate for a non - orthogonal basis set compared to an orthonormal one  @xcite .",
    "secondly , the non - orthogonal basis ( lcao basis ) is built up from quasi - atomic orbitals .",
    "one therefore knows the behaviour of the basis states under symmetry operations belonging to the @xmath169-group which eventually results in the fact that local quantities , e.g.  the on - site green function , are diagonal in the orbital index .",
    "furthermore , the coulomb matrix elements can be calculated in a highly symmetric way by using @xmath170-symbols in combination with a transformation from spheric to cubic harmonics .",
    "the unknown radial parts of the basis are parametrised by the effective slater integrals ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) .",
    "finally , one can ensure that the coulomb interaction acts between 3d - electrons only .    for the formalism of second quantisation , for the many - body and green - function theory , for the proof of wick s theorem and thus the development of the diagram technique",
    ", however , the use of an orthonormal set of one - particle basis states is necessary .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to derive all expressions that refer to the non - orthogonal basis , @xmath171 by a ( non - unitary ) lwdin transformation  @xcite from a related set of orthogonal one - particle basis states : @xmath172 the overlap matrix @xmath173 is hermitian , @xmath174 indeed represents an orthonormal and complete basis set .",
    "the completeness relation can be written as @xmath175 annihilation ( and creation ) operators referring to the non - orthogonal basis may be defined as : @xmath176 it is instructive to see how the creation operator acts on the vacuum state : @xmath177 furthermore , one gets from the transformations ( [ eq : ob ] ) and ( [ eq : oc ] ) : @xmath178 thus , an operator in second quantisation has the same structure for both , the orthonormal and the non - orthogonal basis set .",
    "a one - particle operator @xmath179 , for example , reads as : @xmath180 the non - orthogonal green functions are defined as in the orthonormal case , e.g.   @xmath181 for the one - particle green function .",
    "for example , using the non - orthogonal version of the fundamental anti - commutation rules ( @xmath182_+=s_{\\alpha\\alpha^\\prime}^{-1}$ ] , see also eq .",
