    "ray binaries are transients ; these are called soft x  ray transients ( sxts ) . although several of the neutron star systems were already detected in quiescence with einstein , exosat , asca , and rosat ( e.g.  @xcite ; ; ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , detailed studies of these faint quiescent counterparts to neutron star transients",

    "accretion may be ongoing at a low level producing a soft spectrum ( @xcite ) .",
    "several authors have pointed out that the presence of a @xmath8 gauss magnetic field would have a large influence on the accretion flow .",
    "the onset of a propeller or pulsar wind mechanism (;",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) has been proposed as an explanation of the hard power ",
    "law spectral component .",
    "although detailed theoretical model calculations predicting the spectral shape are absent so far , @xcite argue that in the propeller phase the spectrum will be hard .",
    "in addition to these two apparently mutually exclusive models , it is thought that a soft , thermal spectral component with a luminosity of typically @xmath9 will be generated due to the fact that the neutron star crust and core are heated via pycnonuclear reactions in the crust during the accretion phase .",
    "the crust will thermally radiate in ( soft ) x ",
    "rays , cooling the neutron star ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this model",
    "the observed quiescent luminosity can differ from outburst to outburst by a factor of 23 since the fraction of hydrogen and helium left in the atmosphere after an outburst will vary from outburst to outburst .",
    "this fraction influences the heat flux that flows from the core to the surface ( @xcite ) .",
    "the quiescent luminosity is also likely to vary somewhat from source to source since the neutron star core and crust temperature depend on the mass accretion history of the source and the cooling rate may depend among other things on the neutron star mass .",
    "using hydrogen neutron star atmosphere models to fit the soft part of the quiescent spectrum , neutron star radii and temperatures can be determined .",
    "the observed values are in the range expected from neutron star theory .",
    "if it can be established that the quiescent emission is indeed due to the hot neutron star surface or core , these systems could provide a way to determine neutron star radii .",
    "together with information about the neutron star spin ( e.g.  obtained through burst oscillations [ e.g.  @xcite ] and/or pulsations observed during outburst [ e.g.  @xcite ] ) and mass ( see @xcite ) this provides important information about the behaviour of matter under physical conditions that are unattainable on earth .",
    "recently , using the _ chandra _ satellite we followed the neutron star sxt rx  j170930.2263927 , also called xte  j1709267 , towards quiescence ( @xcite ) .",
    "xte  j1709267 was detected for the first time using rosat all sky survey observations performed in 1990 ( ) .",
    "the source was also detected by rosat in 1992 ( see ; @xcite ) . since then",
    ", the source has been detected with rxte three times ; in 1997 ( @xcite ) , in 2002 ( @xcite ) , and in 2004 ( @xcite ) . during",
    "the 1997 outburst @xcite found type  i bursts using the wide field cameras onboard the _ bepposax _ satellite .",
    "since the source is located only 910 arcminutes away from the core of the globular cluster ngc  6293 it has been speculated that xte  j1709267 is associated with ngc  6293 (; @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we present x  ray and optical observations of xte  j1709267 in quiescence and outburst .",

    "source time was 22.7 ksec .",
    "the x  ray data were processed by the _ chandra _ x  ray centre but we reprocessed the data starting with the level 1 products in order to take full advantage of the newest available calibrations .",
    "we used the _ ciao _ software to reduce the data ( version 3.0.2 and caldb version 2.26 ) .",
    "events with asca grades of 1 , 5 , 7 , cosmic rays , hot pixels , and events close to ccd node boundaries were rejected .",
    "we searched the data for periods of enhanced background radiation but none was present .",
    "hence , all the data were used in our analysis .",
    "we offset pointed the satellite with respect to the known accurate coordinates of xte  j1709267 ( see @xcite ) in order to put some of the globular cluster ngc  6293 in the field  of  view .",
    "we detected @xmath1015 sources , but the coordinates of only one were consistent with those of xte  j1709267 ( the analysis of the other sources will be presented elsewhere ) .",
    "we detected 166 source counts in 22.7 ksec .",
    "the spectrum of xte  j1709267 was extracted from a circular region with a 5 arc second radius centred on the source whereas the background spectrum was extracted from a circular region with a radius of 5 arc seconds located 50 arc seconds east of the source ( 3 background counts were detected in this region ) .",
    "we rebinned the spectrum such that each bin contained at least 5 counts per bin .",
    "because of this low number of counts we used the cash statistic method in our spectral fitting to estimate the errors on the fitting parameters ( @xcite ) .",
    "we only include photons with energies above 0.3 and below 10 kev in our spectral analysis since the acis timed exposure mode spectral response is not well calibrated outside that range . in order to validate the cash statistics we did not subtract the background photons .",
    "these background photons all have energies above 3 kev .",
    "we fit the spectra using the xspec package ( version 11.3.0 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we fit the spectrum with an absorbed black body model and with an absorbed neutron star atmosphere model ( nsa ; @xcite ; ) .",
    "we kept the absorption fixed at the value we found during outburst ( @xmath11 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the galactic absorption , the nsa normalisation , the mass , and the radius of the neutron star , were held fixed during the fit at @xmath12 @xmath4 , @xmath13 pc@xmath14 ( for the distance , d in pc , we took the value of the globular cluster 8.8@xmath15 pc , see section 2.2 ) , and 1.4 m@xmath16 , 10 km , respectively .",
    "the best  fitting parameters are presented in table  [ fitpars ] .",
    "the reddening to the globular cluster ngc  6293 of @xmath17 implies a column density of @xmath18 assuming @xmath19 and using the relation between @xmath20 and @xmath21 of .",
    "we also fitted a nsa and a black body to the data with the @xmath21 fixed at @xmath22 ( see table  [ fitpars ] ) .",
    "the best  fitting parameters are consistent within the 90 per cent confidence contours with those obtained using @xmath23 .",
    "the flux in the last two bins is underestimated for both the black body ( see figure  [ bbfit ] ) and the nsa model fits .",
    "this can ( partially ) be explained by the fact that we did not subtract the background .",
    "had we subtracted the background as defined above it would have reduced the count rate above 3 kev ( 3 out of the 10 photons detected above 3 kev would have been labelled background photons ) .",
    "additionally , a hard ( power  law ) spectral could be present . a power ",
    "law spectral component with index 2 contributes less than 20 per cent to the unabsorbed flux in the 0.510 kev band .",
    "the absorbed 0.510 kev source flux for both models and both @xmath21 values considered above was consistent with @xmath24 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 , whereas the unabsorbed flux was @xmath25 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 . here the error is determined from the range in fluxes derived from the various models .",
    "for all models we performed a monte carlo simulation ( using the goodness command in xspec ) .",
    "we simulated 10@xmath26 spectra based on a gaussian distribution of parameters centred on the best ",
    "fit model parameters with a gaussian width set by the 1@xmath27 errors on the fit parameters .",
    "the percentage of these simulations with the fit statistic less than that for the data is more than the fiducial 50 per cent mark for 3 of the 4 cases considered , but again this may be partially explained by the presence of background photons in the last two bins .",
    "the goodness percentages are given in table  [ fitpars ] .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath28 value in outburst , corrected for the contribution of the nearby interloper",
    "we observed the neutron star sxt xte  j1709267 on several occasions in outburst and quiescence in x  ray and optical .",
    "the brightening of a star from @xmath0=22.24@xmath10.03 in quiescence to @xmath0=20.5@xmath10.1 in outburst and its positional coincidence with the chandra position for xte  j1709267 provides convincing evidence that we have discovered the optical counterpart ( @xcite ) . obviously , there is a small chance that the star found in quiescence is an interloper and not the true counterpart ; spectroscopic observations of the proposed quiescent counterpart will test this . if we assume , however , that we also detected the optical counterpart in quiescence , the absolute magnitude , @xmath29 , for the counterpart would be @xmath30 where we have assumed an @xmath0band interstellar absorption , @xmath31 , of 0.921.84 magnitudes , respectively [ for a distance of 8.8 kpc , from @xmath32 , and from the relations between @xmath21 , @xmath20 , and @xmath31 given by @xcite and ] . these @xmath29values are consistent with xte  j1709267 being a low  mass x  ray binary with a late type ( k ) dwarf companion .",
    "the unabsorbed luminosity in the 0.510 kev x  ray band we find using _ chandra _ observations of the source in quiescence is only slightly lower than the lowest luminosity measured by @xcite ( approximately a factor 2 ; in that paper we gave the unabsorbed flux in the 0.110 kev and not the 0.510 kev band ) .",
    "so , the decay in luminosity in about 14 months is small ( approximately factor of 2 ) .",
    "this is in contrast with the decay rate of the quasi  persistent source mxb  165929 .",
    "@xcite found that for that source the bolometric luminosity decreased by a factor 79 in 18 months .",
    "such a difference could be explained by the fact that mxb  165929 had been accreting steadily for several years before returning to quiescence .",
    "this extended period of steady accretion may have heated the neutron star crust to temperatures higher than that of the neutron star core and after the outburst the crust cools down ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , this difference could also reflect a difference between the quiescent mass accretion rates , although it is unclear why in some sources the mass accretion rate hits a minimum close after the outburst whereas in other neutron star stxs like mxb  165929 the mass accretion rate keeps decreasing gradually .",
    "recently , we found ( @xcite ) that there seems to be an anti  correlation between the fractional power  law contribution to the 0.510 kev luminosity and the source luminosity in quiescence for quiescent luminosities lower than @xmath6 erg s@xmath5 and a correlation between these two parameters for luminosities above this luminosity . in figure",
    "[ relation ] we plot the power ",
    "law fractional contribution to the total 0.510 kev unabsorbed quiescent luminosity for several neutron star sxts for which the distance is accurately known . to obtain the quiescent luminosities we use distances quoted in @xcite for the systems where",
    "photospheric radius expansion bursts have been observed . since the photospheric radius expansion burst luminosity is thought to be close to 2.0 or 3.8@xmath33 ( see ) we use a range in quiescent luminosities to account for this ambiguity in source distance . in the case of xte",
    "j1709267 we took a distance range of 812 kpc . for the neutron star sxts in the globular clusters",
    "terzan  5 and ngc  6440 we took a distance of 8.7@xmath34 kpc and 8.5@xmath35 kpc , respectively ( @xcite ; ) .",
    "finally for cen  x4 we use a distance of 1.2 kpc ( @xcite ; ; @xcite ) .",
    "we do not take into account errors on the source quiescent luminosities due to errors on the measured source flux since these are typically smaller than the uncertainty in the burst chemical composition . when the error on the power ",
    "law contribution to the flux was not given in the literature we assumed an error of 10 per cent .",
    "finally , we included in the plot globular cluster sources which are thought to be quiescent neutron star sxts on the basis of their soft spectrum ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we used the sources and limits on the power law component in the spectrum as found by @xcite.0.3 kpc for the globular cluster @xmath36  cen ( @xcite ) , 10.3@xmath10.8 kpc for m  80 ( ) , 5.2@xmath10.3 kpc for 47  tuc , 3.6@xmath10.3 kpc for ngc  6397 , and 9.5@xmath10.9 kpc for m  30 ( all from @xcite ) . ]    to the high luminosity side , the trend of increasing power ",
    "law fraction with luminosity is dominated by the data points of xte  j1709267 which was followed by _",
    "chandra _ during its decay to quiescence after an outburst ( jonker et al .",
    "2003 ; see also table  [ refit ] ) .",
    "we found that the power law contribution to the 0.510 kev x  ray luminosity decreased from 72 per cent on mjd 52365.018 , to 48 per cent on mjd 52374.727 , to less than 19 per cent using the combined data from observation 3492 and 3507 .",
    "the detailed study of aql  x1 confirms the observed trend ( rutledge et al .",
    "however , the quiescent properties of the counterpart to the neutron star sxt exo  1745248 in the dense globular cluster core of terzan  5 seemingly do not fit the correlation ( wijnands et al .",
    "perhaps the identified source is an interloper or perhaps the distance to terzan  5 is much smaller than what is assumed ( derived a distance of 5.6 kpc ) .",
    "alternatively , the apparent correlation is spurious and terzan  5 is the first source to fill  in the gap .",
    "if the apparent smooth change in power  law contribution to the quiescent luminosity is real it could mean that the nature of the power ",
    "law spectral component at high and low source luminosities is different .    since we observed the power ",
    "law contribution in xte  j1709267 to decrease when the source returned to quiescence after an outburst it is conceivable that the power ",
    "law component at luminosities above @xmath6 erg s@xmath5 finds its origin in residual accretion .",
    "it has been proposed that neutron star sxts enter a propeller regime when the outburst decay rate steepens impeding most if not all accretion ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , pulsations were still detected in sax  j1808.43658 after the alleged onset of the propeller mechanism ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , steepening of the decay is also found in black hole candidate sxts ( e.g.  @xcite ) . finally , the work of shows that there is a class of burst sources which likely accrete at a low level .",
    "deep observations a few hours after the detection of a type  i burst in sax  j2224 + 5421 did not reveal a persistent source with a 210 kev upper limit of 1.3@xmath37 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 ( ) , which for the distance of sax  j2224 + 5421 leads to an upper limit on the luminosity in that band of 7.4@xmath38 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "therefore , we think it is more likely that the origin of the power  law at relatively high quiescent luminosities lies in residual accretion . if so this can help explain the observed short term neutron star temperature changes in aql  x1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these short term temperature changes pose a problem for the cooling neutron star core / crust model .",
    "however , if residual accretion is ongoing the observed changes can , for instance , be explained as being the result of a different hydrogen and helium content in the atmosphere during the two observations caused by the residual accretion .",
    "hence , the fact that this power  law component can be explained at least qualitatively in terms of residual accretion helps the cooling neutron star model as an explanation for the thermal component .",
    "the origin of the power ",
    "law on the low quiescent luminosities side of @xmath39 erg s@xmath5 is still unclear . since sax  j1808.43658 is known to have a sizable magnetic field the power ",
    "law component could be explained as being due to a pulsar  wind mechanism ( e.g.  @xcite ; ) .",
    "however , this can not explain the strong power ",
    "law components in the non  pulsating sources cen  x4 , sax  j1810.82609 , and xte  j2123058 although one must bear in mind that cen  x4 and sax  j1810.82609 have not been observed with _",
    "rxte_/pca when the sources were in outburst ( whereas xte  j2123058 _ has _ been observed with _",
    "rxte_/pca in outburst see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "a possible explanation for the apparent correlation between the fractional power  law contribution and the total 0.510 kev luminosity at low quiescent luminosities is that there is a power ",
    "law spectral component with a luminosity of @xmath40 .",
    "this power ",
    "law luminosity would then need to be approximately the same for all sources ; the luminosity of the black body can differ between sources . in the cooling neutron star model the luminosity of the thermal component depends on the time",
    "averaged mass accretion rate and the neutron star mass ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a low black body luminosity could point at a low time  averaged mass accretion rate and/or a large neutron star mass allowing for enhanced core cooling ( cf .",
    "the nature of the power  law and why it would have a luminosity close to @xmath40 in the 0.510 kev band is unclear .        finally , we found a precursor to several type  i x  ray bursts of xte  j1709267 .",
    "a similar burst with a precursor was found for the bursting atoll source 4u  163653 .",
    "a precursor to the main burst event in relatively long bursts has been associated with photospheric radius expansion bursts ( see @xcite ) . however , from a comparison of the burst properties of photospheric radius expansion bursts in 4u  163653 ( galloway et al .  in preparation ) with the properties of the burst with a precursor in 4u  163653 we conclude that these bursts with precursors in 4u  163653 and hence also in xte  j1709267 are not photospheric radius expansion bursts . perhaps these precursor events are related to bursts with multiple peaks observed in 4u  163653 ( @xcite ; ) .",
