    "stars with planets detected with the doppler method ( swps ) have been shown to be more metal - rich @xcite and more massive @xcite as a group when compared to similar stars without detected planets ( non - swps ) .",
    "recently , swp and non - swps have also been reported to differ in vsini @xcite , abundance - condensation temperature ( t@xmath0 ) trends @xcite , li abundance @xcite , and chromospheric activity @xcite , but each of these findings has been disputed .",
    "@xcite did not find a significant difference in vsini between their samples of swps and non - swps .",
    "@xcite found the li abundance distributions to be indistinguishable between their samples of solar analog swps and non - swps .",
    "@xcite do not find a significant difference in abundance - t@xmath0 trends between their samples of solar analog swps and non - swps .",
    "finally , @xcite do not find a significant difference in chromospheric activity between their samples of swps and non - swps .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to revisit these controversies using published data and the method of analysis described in our recent series of papers @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we compare the vsini distributions between swps and non - swps . in section 3",
    "we examine abundance - t@xmath0 trends .",
    "we compare chromospheric activity in section 4 .",
    "we summarize our results in section 5 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite compared vsini values of swps and non - swps using two samples .",
    "one of the samples was based on the extensive dataset of @xcite , which remains the best data for comparing swp and non - swp vsini values .",
    "however , since we completed our most recent analysis using their data , many new exoplanets have been discovered .",
    "the presence of undiscovered planets among the non - swps has been a source of unavoidable systematic error , but it is one that is becoming less important as new planets are discovered .",
    "the full sample of stars from @xcite contains 1040 dwarfs ; at the time of the paper s publication 85 of these stars with t@xmath1 k were known to host doppler - detected planets . to form our subsample , we first calculated the absolute visual magnitudes using the recalibrated hipparcos parallaxes and then excluded those stars with a parallax value less than 10 times the parallax error .",
    "next , we excluded stars with t@xmath2 5500 k and t@xmath3 6450 k ; this is slightly broader than the range we had used in @xcite , 5550 to 6250 k. our final sample contains 99 swps and 627 non - swps .",
    "this compares to 82 swps and 594 non - swps used in @xcite .",
    "t@xmath2 6250 k are 93 and 578 , respectively . ]",
    "we applied our method of analysis described in @xcite and @xcite to the present data . in brief",
    ", we calculated a weighted average difference between the vsini value of an swp and the vsini values of all the comparison stars using the inverse square of the @xmath4 index as the weight .",
    "the @xmath4 index is a measure of the distance between two stars in t@xmath5-log @xmath6-[fe / h]-m@xmath7 parameter space .",
    "we have made one minor change to this procedure compared to our previous studies .",
    "previously , we had used [ fe / h ] as one of the parameters needed to calculate the @xmath4 index . however , using [ fe / h ] could lead to a systematic error when thick disk stars are in the sample , since they have a different value of [ @xmath8/fe ] compared to thin disk stars .",
    "when we are considering the possible dependence of planet formation on composition , [ m / h ] is a better index to use than [ fe / h ] @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have replaced [ fe / h ] with [ m / h ] when calculating the @xmath4 index .",
    "we show in figure 1a the bias - corrected weighted average vsini differences between the swp and non - swp samples ( @xmath9vsini ) .",
    "we corrected the @xmath9vsini values for bias in the same way as described in @xcite .",
    "briefly , the method involves splitting the non - swp sample into two subsamples .",
    "we then calculated @xmath9vsini values from these subsamples in the same way as was done with the original swp and non - swp samples .",
    "any trends in these @xmath9vsini values with t@xmath5 are considered biases .",
    "the results presented in figure 1a resemble those in figure 12 of @xcite , which was also based on the data of @xcite . as in @xcite",
    ", we subtracted the average linear ( bias ) trend from the non - swp @xmath9vsini - t@xmath5 data from the swp @xmath9vsini values .",
    "however , as is evident in figure 11 of @xcite , the required bias correction is not quite linear with t@xmath5 .",
    "vsini ) using the samples described in the text .",
    "the open circle with the dot represents the solar value .",
    "one swp with a @xmath9vsini value of 16.4 km s@xmath10 in @xmath11 and 13.1 km s@xmath10 in @xmath12 is off the plotted range .",
    "a different bias correction was applied in @xmath12 ; see text for details.,width=336 ]    for this reason , we also corrected for bias using a second method .",
    "we calculated the vsini difference values in increments of 100 k using the non - swp sample and applied these offsets to the vsini differences between the swps and non - swps .",
    "we show the results of this approach in figure 1b .",
    "the overall pattern is similar to that in figure 1a , but the distribution of vsini differences is flatter between 5500 and 6000 k. the average @xmath9vsini value for the data plotted in figure 1b between these two temperatures is @xmath13 ( s.e . ) @xmath14 ( s.e.m . ) km s@xmath10 .",
    "the corresponding average @xmath9vsini value determined by @xcite from the @xcite data is @xmath15 ( s.e . ) @xmath16 ( s.e.m . )",
    "km s@xmath10 ( for t@xmath17 to 6000 k ) .",
    "@xcite reported the abundances of five elements : na , si , ti , fe and ni . while this is a small number of elements for our analysis , their t@xmath0 values span nearly the same range as the more extensive set of elements employed by @xcite . in addition , the @xcite dataset is large and the abundances have small uncertainties .",
    "the samples of swps and non - swps we use in this sections are the same ones we used for the vsini analysis above .",
    "we calculated the abundance - t@xmath0 slope for each star with simple linear least - squares .",
    "we then calculated the weighted - average [ x / h]-t@xmath0 differences between the swps and non - swps using the same procedure as described above .",
    "however , in this case the bias corrections are small , allowing us to adjust the data with a simple linear fit , as in @xcite .",
    "we show the corrected data in figure 2 .",
    "it resembles the data in figure 2 of @xcite .",
    "-t@xmath0 slope differences between swps and non - swps using data from @xcite.,width=336 ]    @xcite also confirmed the discovery by @xcite that the more metal - rich swps display more negative [ x / h]-t@xmath0 slopes than non - swps , while more metal - poor swps do nt .",
    "we find very similar patterns in the current data , which we show in figure 3 .",
    "@xmath18 are shown in @xmath11 , and swps with [ m / h ] @xmath19 are shown in @xmath12.,width=336 ]",
    "@xcite present chromospheric activity measurements of more than 2600 stars on the california planet search program . in particular , they tabulate median values of @xmath20 r@xmath21 , which we use in the following analyses .",
    "we cross - referenced their data with the @xcite data and excluded stars with t@xmath2 5500 k and t@xmath3 6420 k ; we also applied the same parallax quality cut used above in our vsini analysis .",
    "these cuts resulted in samples of 63 swps and 364 non - swps .",
    "we calculated weighted differences in @xmath20 r@xmath21 using these two samples and corrected for bias using the same method used to produce figure 1 .",
    "we show the results in figure 4 .",
    "r@xmath21 differences between swps and non - swps from @xcite shown in @xmath11 .",
    "a different cut is applied to the non - swps comparison sample in @xmath12 ; see text for details.,width=336 ]    the differences between the swps and non - swps are readily apparent in figure 4a .",
    "however , we should be cautious in how we interpret this result .",
    "the swp @xmath20 r@xmath21 values range from -5.117 to -4.610 , while it ranges from -5.206 to -3.879 for the non - swps .",
    "the apparent negative differences in @xmath20 r@xmath21 for the majority of swps , then , could be due , in part , to the excess number of active stars in the non - swp sample . in order to determine",
    "if this difference in the two samples can fully account for the pattern in figure 4a , we have produced a second non - swp sample using a conservative upper cutoff of -4.60 for @xmath20 r@xmath21 , resulting in a sample size of 307 stars .",
    "we repeated the above analysis using the same swp sample as for figure 4a and the new , more conservative non - swp sample ; the results are shown in figure 4b .",
    "there are far fewer swps with negative mean differences in @xmath20 r@xmath21 in figure 4b compared to figure 4a",
    ". however , a trend is still evident .",
    "a linear least - squares fit to the data yields a slope of @xmath22 k@xmath10 ; the mean weighted difference is zero at t@xmath23 k. the pearson correlation coefficient for the data in figure 4b is 0.283 .",
    "this translates into a 5 % probability that the trend is due to chance alone .",
    "the truth should lie somewhere between figures 4a and 4b .",
    "while the more conservative cut in @xmath20 r@xmath21 values employed in preparing figure 4b excludes stars that are much more active than any swps in our sample , it probably also excludes some stars whose @xmath20 r@xmath21 values would not prevent doppler detection of planets . for instance , hd 22049 has a @xmath20 r@xmath21 value near -4.5 , 0.1 unit larger than our cutoff .",
    "we do nt know why our conclusions are different from those of @xcite , but we do note some differences with their study .",
    "first , our samples are very different ; we employ a much larger sample of non - swps .",
    "second , our method of analysis compares swps to non - swps with similar physical parameters , including age .",
    "the @xmath20 r@xmath21 index is known to be sensitive to age .",
    "perhaps the difference we uncovered between swps and non - swps is too subtle to detect with other statistical approaches .",
    "using an updated version of the method of analysis described in @xcite , we have verified that there are significant differences in vsini , abundance - t@xmath24 trends , and chromospheric activity between swps and non - swps .",
    "we employed high - quality data from the literature , taking into account new planets that have been discovered since the data were originally published .",
    "we have verified that swps have significantly smaller values of vsini , abundance - t@xmath24 slope , and r@xmath21 compared to otherwise similar non - swps . for the case of the abundance - t@xmath24 slope differences , we also verified that they are significant when comparing stars with [ m / h ] @xmath25 0.10 , but not for more metal - poor stars .",
    "it is also notable that all three parameters display the largest differences between the swp and non - swp samples for t@xmath5 less than about 5900 k.",
