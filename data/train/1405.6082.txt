    "a cylindrical algebraic decomposition ( cad ) dissects @xmath0 into cells , each described by polynomial relations and arranged cylindrically so that the projection of any two cells into lower coordinates is equal or disjoint .",
    "cad is a key tool , both for its original motivation of quantifier elimination ( qe ) over real - closed fields and many other applications discovered since . for a more detailed introduction see huang _",
    "et al_. @xcite and the references within . when using cad there may be a choice for the variable ordering and it is well known that this can have a great effect on the tractability of a problem .",
    "we recently tested the following three heuristics for picking this ordering .",
    "suggested by brown @xcite , this heuristic chooses a variable ordering according to three criteria on the input system .",
    "we start with the first and break ties with successive ones .",
    "the advice is to eliminate a variable first if :    it has lower overall degree in the input ;    it has lower ( maximum ) total degree of those terms in the input in which it occurs ;    there is a smaller number of terms in the input which contain the variable .",
    "suggested by dolzmann _",
    "et al_. @xcite , this heuristic constructs the full set of projection polynomials for each ordering and selects the ordering whose set has the lowest _ sum of total degree _ for each of the monomials in each of the polynomials .",
    "suggested by bradford _",
    "et al_. @xcite , this heuristic also constructs the full projection set , and selects the one with the lowest _ number of distinct real roots _ of the univariate polynomials .",
    "brown s heuristic is the cheapest , checking only simple properties of the input .",
    "ndrr is the most expensive ( requiring real root isolation ) but is the only one to consider the real geometry .",
    "all three heuristics may identify more than one variable ordering as a suitable choice . in this case",
    "we took the heuristic s choice to be the first of these after they had been ordered lexicographically ( when written as a tuple in the reverse order to which they are projected ) .",
    "we ran a machine learning experiment involving these heuristics @xcite .",
    "two experiments were undertaken , one for cad and another for qe by cad , in both cases implemented by qepcad - b .",
    "7001 three - variable qe problems were taken from the nlsat database , all of which were fully existential ( satisfiability or sat problems ) . removing",
    "all quantifiers gave a corresponding problem set for evaluating cad alone . in huang _",
    "et al_. @xcite the problems were split into training , evaluation and test sets but here we report on the performance of the heuristics for all problems . in each case the heuristic s selections were compared according to the number of cells produced ( as opposed to computation time : so the experiment concerns the cad theory rather than just the qepcad implementation ) .",
    "note that cell counts are usually smaller for quantified problems as partial cad techniques can be used to stop the lifting process early when the outcome is already determined .",
    "we first observed for how many problems ( and thus for what percentage of the problem set ) each heuristic made the most competitive selection of the three :    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we note first that the conclusion of which heuristic is the best varies depending on the criteria used to judge , whether we consider quantified problems or not ( and indeed various other features of the problem which is why machine learning was useful @xcite ) .",
    "we highlight the strong performance of brown s heuristic , surprising both because it requires the least computation and since it was not formally published .",
    "( to the best of our knowledge it is mentioned only in notes to a tutorial at issac 2004 @xcite ) .",
    "the problems in our example set are all from genuine applications , but are quite different to those for which cad is normally used .",
    "hence further experimentation would be beneficial to see if the results can be verified more generally .",
    "other future work will include the testing of greedy and combination heuristics , perhaps leading to the development of a new heuristic .",
