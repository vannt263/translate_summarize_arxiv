    "one of the main by - product results of macho and eros projects is the discovery of many double - mode cepheids ( dmcs ) pulsating in both the fundamental- and first - overtone mode ( f/1o ) , and the first- and second - overtone ( 1o/2o ) modes , in the lmc and smc ( e.g. alcock et al .",
    "@xcite ; alcock et al .",
    "@xcite ; beaulieu et al .",
    "the presence of many 1o/2o dmcs raises immediately the question of the possible existence of cepheids pulsating purely in the second overtone mode , but up to now none have been found , probably because it is difficult to identify them unambiguously .",
    "they should have short periods and should be found preferentially in low metallicity galaxies ( see e.g. alcock et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in fact , while many 1o/2o dmcs have been discovered in the magellanic clouds , only one of these stars ( co aur ; mantegazza @xcite ) was observed in our galaxy .",
    "the importance of second overtone mode cepheids relies on their being , among cepheids , the third possible benchmark for the stellar interior and evolution theory beside fundamental and first overtone mode cepheids .",
    "recently antonello & kanbur ( @xcite ) studied the characteristics of these stars predicted by nonlinear pulsation models , and remarked in particular the effects of the resonance @xmath1 at @xmath2 d ( @xmath3 is the period ) between the second and sixth overtone mode .",
    "resonances represent a powerful comparison tool between observations and theoretical model predictions , because they affect the shape of the curves of stars in a specific period range , for example @xmath4 at @xmath5 d in fundamental mode cepheids ( simon & lee , @xcite ) and @xmath6 at @xmath7 d in first overtone cepheids ( antonello et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the close comparison allows to probe the stellar interior and to put constraints on the stellar physical parameters .",
    "recently , beaulieu ( @xcite ) mentioned some possible second overtone candidates in the smc , and it would be interesting to observe them accurately in order to confirm their nature .",
    "the magellanic cloud variables were extensively studied about thirty years ago by c. payne  gaposchkin and s. gaposchkin .",
    "one of us ( antonello , @xcite ) used their results concerning the asymmetry parameter of cepheid light curves for studying the differences between fundamental and first overtone mode cepheids , and , in the case of the smc ( payne - gaposchkin & gaposchkin @xcite ) , he noted four stars with short period and unusual asymmetry parameter ( that is unusual light curve ) and indicated them as possible second overtone mode candidates . in the present note",
    "we report about the results of new observations of three of these stars : hv 1777 , hv 1779 and hv 1353 .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "the common characteristics of the four stars is the low amplitude , which can explain the difficulty in obtaining reliable light curves from photographic observations .",
    "the light curve of hv 1353 is typical of a fundamental mode pulsator , and this is confirmed by the low order fourier parameters , which have normal values for smc cepheids ( beaulieu & sasselov @xcite ) .",
    "a possible explanation for the low amplitude of hv1353 is a companion or a background star with comparable luminosity .",
    "this would imply also a lower intrinsic luminosity of the cepheid by several tenths of a magnitude , placing the star well below the continuous line in fig .",
    "8 ; the unknown reddening could alleviate the discrepancy .",
    "8 shows the position of our stars in the @xmath8 diagram , compared with the relation reported by laney & stobie ( @xcite , continuous line ) valid for fundamental mode pulsators , the relation for first overtone mode pulsators ( dotted line ) derived assuming a period ratio @xmath9 , and the relation for second overtone mode pulsators ( dashed line ) assuming @xmath10 .",
    "the magnitudes of our stars , however , were not corrected for reddening and for the smc tilt effect ( laney & stobie @xcite ) .",
    "= 12truecm    hv 1777 , hv 1763 and hv 1779 have light curves , low order fourier parameters , periods and amplitudes similar to those of smc first overtone mode cepheids with similar period ( beaulieu & sasselov @xcite ) , and also the position in the @xmath8 diagram confirm the first overtone pulsation of hv 1777 and hv 1763 .",
    "the position of hv 1779 would be compatible with the second overtone pulsation .",
    "only one measurement of @xmath11 is available for each star .",
    "taking into account the low amplitude and the phase of the observations , the @xmath11 values for hv 1353 , hv 1763 and hv 1779 , which are 0.40 , 0.27 and 0.27 , respectively , should be close to the true mean color value within few hundredths of a magnitude , while in the case of hv 1777 the observation ( @xmath11 = 0.26 ) was made when the star was near the maximum light .",
    "second overtone mode cepheids could be discriminated from fundamental and first overtone mode cepheids by taking into account their period , luminosity , low amplitude and fourier parameters ( antonello & kanbur @xcite ; alcock et al .",
    "however , none of the stars analyzed in the present study , and which are characterized by low amplitude , can be discriminated from the other known cepheid types on the basis of the light curve shape .",
    "only hv 1779 is relatively bright for its period , but this is not a sufficient criterium , since the relatively large luminosity could be explained by other reasons ( e.g. a companion or a background star ) .",
    "we conclude that the three suspected second overtone candidates are fundamental ( hv 1353 ) and first overtone ( hv 1777 , hv 1779 ) mode pulsators .",
    "hv 1763 , whose nature was previously unknown , resulted to be a short  period cepheid pulsating in the first overtone mode .",
