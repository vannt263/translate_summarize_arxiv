    "transport phenomenon through ratchet action is one of the active areas of research interest@xcite .",
    "ratchet as a device allows motion in one direction while restricting the motion in the opposite direction .",
    "ratchet action or ratcheting is in general a directed transport using an unbiased energy produced by some source such as chemical action in biological motors .",
    "the literature on ratchet action dates back to the thought experiment of feynman and smoluchowski@xcite , where a periodic and spatially asymmetric system , in contact with a single heat bath was expected to extract work from random fluctuations ( heat ) , apparently contradicting the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "they pointed out that , if only equilibrium fluctuations are acting , then there would be no directed motion in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "therefore the system has to be driven out of equilibrium by some additional deterministic or stochastic perturbations .",
    "these perturbations are taken to be unbiased , that is , their time , space and ensemble averages are zero .",
    "along with that , if the spatial symmetry of the system is broken ( most commonly , this is done by involving the so - called ratchet potential , which is periodic with broken spatial symmetry ) , then these two conditions are sufficient to have a directed transport even without a net force in a spatially periodic system . these type of ratchet systems with thermal noise",
    "are called brownian motors .",
    "there are also other kinds of ratchets in absence of thermal noise .",
    "they are either chaotic dynamical dissipative ratchets or purely hamiltonian ratchets .",
    "symmetry analysis allows one to figure out necessary conditions ( not sufficient ) for directed transport in these systems .",
    "these symmetry analysis shows that we must have some broken symmetries to have ratchet action . its application to understand the directed dynamics in different fields ranging from biological systems to quantum",
    "mechanical system@xcite has continued to entice interest to explore new ratchet designs which can effectively model transport processes in various classical and quantum systems .    in this paper",
    ", we present a model for quantum ratchet which will mimic our conventional model of ratchet as a device , in both ordered and disordered discrete - time quantum walk ( d - dqw ) system .",
    "each step of dqw evolves a particle into superposition of position space and for certain configuration of the initial state and parameter defining the evolution operators@xcite the wave - packet spread symmetrically on both sides of the initial position .",
    "compared to the classical random walk , the spread of the probability distribution for dqw is quadratically faster and this has resulted in the use of quantum walks as a tool for various quantum algorithms  @xcite .",
    "however , a spreading wavepacket has been shown to localize dynamically around the initial position in space when the parameter in the coin operation are randomly changed for each step , that is , temporal disorder@xcite,@xcite . since temporal disorder is homogeneous over the lattice space and evolution is symmetric over time , there is no directed impulse on the wave - packet resulting in a zero mean displacement in position space .",
    "therefore , engineering quantum ratchet in d - dqw can play an important role in engineering quantum transport in disordered systems and to explore new models to understand directed transport in various discrete two - level quantum systems . to produce ratchet effect in d - dqw we mark a position in position space and for that marked position we introduce a fixed coin operation different from the one used for rest of the position .",
    "the fixed coin operation at the marked position will effectively act as a pawl .",
    "this will break the symmetry in the position space and gives rise to the directed transport of the wavepacket in the desired direction .",
    "we will show that the rate of directed transport can be optimized to transport the quantum state with the mean displacement of up to the order proportional to the number of steps of the walk ( @xmath1 ) . even without any optimization ,",
    "the mean displacement in position space is noticeably higher over the earlier known ratchet model in dqw without disorder@xcite .",
    "one of the important aspect to note in our model is the absence of decohering noise , that is , the complete dynamics including the pawl effect is defined by the entangling unitary operators .",
    "therefore , the ratchet in dqw will be very useful for coherent quantum transport .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section[section2 ] we present the dynamics of dqw and show the localization effect with temporal disorder . in section[section3 ] we present a scheme to introduce quantum ratchet in dqw and show the directed transport using different configuration of evolution . in section[section4",
    "] we discuss the effect on entanglement during the directed transport and conclude with discussion in section[section5 ] .",
    "discrete - time quantum walk ( dqw ) is a quantum analog of classical random walk in discrete space , and time @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the walk is described on a hilbert space composing of a @xmath2 and a @xmath3 .",
    "the joint state of the system at any time @xmath1 is given by , @xmath4 ~ \\nonumber\\\\ \\in   ~ \\mathcal{h}_c \\otimes \\mathcal{h}_x \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath5    each step of walk evolution is given by a unitary evolution operator @xmath6 , which is a composition of coin operation @xmath7 on a coin space followed by a coin state dependent spatial shift operation @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "for our choice of @xmath9 , the coin operation is described by , @xmath10 and the shift operation is given by , @xmath11 we can see that the operation @xmath7 evolves the qubit ( any two - level system ) to the superposition of the basis states and the operation @xmath8 evolves the particle in superposition of position space .",
    "the single step dqw operator looks like , @xmath12,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 .",
    "instantaneous state of the whole system , @xmath14 or , @xmath15^ { \\big\\lfloor \\frac{t}{\\tau } \\big\\rfloor } \\ket{\\psi(0)}$ ] where @xmath16 is the time taken for evolving each step of the walk .    using the definition of translation operator , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is an eigenstate of the momentum operator @xmath19",
    ", we can derive the effective hamiltonian of the system according to the definition , @xmath20    @xmath21   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where ,  @xmath22 .",
    "effective energy eigenvalues @xmath23 of the hamiltonian in eq.([ham ] ) are , @xmath24.\\ ] ] the group velocity is calculated as , @xmath25 the group velocity can be related to the probability distribution of walk@xcite . for a given @xmath26",
    "one can find the value of @xmath18 for which the peak in the probability distribution is known to appear at position @xmath27@xcite using the relation , @xmath28 . for standard dqw , symmetric spread of wavepacket in both the direction",
    "is seen whereas , for d - dqw the wavepacket is localized around the origin .",
    "[ fig : stddisqw ] ]    it was first predicted by anderson@xcite that potential energy disorder can cause localization in crystals .",
    "later it was experimentally shown to be true and theoretically verified in a variety of systems@xcite .",
    "spatial disorders actually mimics spatial defects present in the media .",
    "if we consider the defects to be random , we can easily mimic the situation by introducing some random spatial disorder and this will lead to localization .",
    "however , defects are not always present in the medium ( spatial ) alone , random disturbances , which means , temporal disorders can be a source of defects in the evolution .",
    "this is taken into account by having some randomly chosen disturbance in the evolution of the system and this also is know to gives rise to localization ( dynamic ) .",
    "similar to the above results we also expect localization of the quantum wave - packet in dqw with disordered environments in both space and time@xcite .    in this work",
    "we will only consider temporal disorder dqw ( d - dqw ) for our study .",
    "for introducing disorder in time we vary the coin parameter @xmath29 randomly in each evolution of the walk .",
    "this temporal disorder gives rise to localization of the wave packet in position space@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "figure[fig : stddisqw ] depicts the comparison of probability distribution in position space between the standard dqw and d - dqw . for the coin operation @xmath7 we have chosen , we get symmetric distribution when the initial state is @xmath30",
    ". therefore , for all our study in this work we use @xmath31 as the initial state so that there is no biasing of the distribution due to the initial state .",
    "the localization under temporal disorder in the figure can also be explained by the concept of group velocity of a wave - packet discussed earlier in this section .    in d - dqw ,",
    "the temporal disorder is homogeneous in space .",
    "so if we start with a state at the origin , @xmath32 , d - dqw will spread the wave - packet as much to the left as to the right of @xmath32 .",
    "hence although there are excitations present in the system the wave packet remains stationary ( see figure[fig : stddisqw ] ) .",
    "this can be easily seen by noting that the group velocity of the wave packet in d - dqw will have time dependent coin parameter i.e , @xmath33    where , @xmath34 is a random function of @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the central momentum and if @xmath37 be the total time for the complete random coin evolution , we will have , average group velocity @xmath38 . for simplicity , from",
    "hereafter we will choose @xmath39 .",
    "note @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ grpvel ] ) is a linear function of @xmath41 .",
    "so , if @xmath42 varies over it s complete period @xmath43 randomly or following some uniform distributed function , then averaging over the whole period , the group velocity will come out to be zero .",
    "for any general initial state we can show that the expectation value of position over the period is always zero as distribution is always symmetric around the initial position .",
    "this shows there is no transport of the wave - packet in d - dqw .",
    "to get a directed transport in dqw we need to have some directionality in the initial state of particle or asymmetry in the coin operation  @xcite .",
    "however , these biasing will not lead anywhere towards giving a directionality for d - dqw . a ratchet in dqw",
    "should be the one which will give directionality to both , dqw and d - dqw .",
    "a ratchet like transport can arises from locally broken symmetries .",
    "therefore , in this work we present a method to break the spatial symmetry of the walk operator locally which will result in introducing directionality to both dqw and d - dqw .",
    "spatial symmetry is broken by introducing a pawl like effect in the form of fixed coin operations at marked position .    in figure[fig",
    ": schematicpawl ] we show the schematic of one possible configuration of introducing pawl like effect on the spatial position .",
    "the coin parameter , @xmath26 at @xmath44 and @xmath45 are chosen to be equal to @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively and at all other positions , some constant value , @xmath48 is fixed .    0.2 in , title=\"fig : \" ]     after 100 steps of evolution .",
    "the initial state chosen for both the evolution , @xmath30 . because of the pawl like effect the wavepacket is directed towards the positive @xmath49 direction for smaller value of @xmath26 and locked around the initial position for larger value of @xmath26 .",
    "[ fig : raatchetregqw ] ]    if the initial position of the particle is at @xmath45 , after first step the state @xmath50 @xmath51 and after second step @xmath52 .",
    "similarly , if the initial state of the particle is at the position @xmath53 the state @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , locally ( at position @xmath55 ) , the spatial symmetry is broken .",
    "this configuration will introduce a pawl like effect to the dqw system .",
    "pawl like effect at marked position @xmath56 results in the a transport of wavepacket in increasing direction of @xmath49 for both standard , and disordered dqw .",
    "in figure[fig : raatchetregqw ] we show the directed propagation of wavepacket for smaller values of @xmath26 and localized component around the origin for larger value of @xmath26 when the pawl effect is introduced .",
    "the coin operation , at @xmath57 effectively blocks the spread of the wavepacket in the negative @xmath49 direction .",
    "also , choosing @xmath58 at @xmath45 enhances the possibility of the rightward propagation .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that the group velocity of a wavepacket given in eq.([grpvel ] ) is maximum for @xmath59 and hence for any smaller value of @xmath26 we get a delocalized wave packet in positive direction of @xmath49 .",
    "we should note that the probability of the wavepacket at positions far from origin get significantly small with the increase in @xmath26 resulting in the wide spread of small non - zero probability at all position in the rightward direction .",
    "we will later see that this apparent disadvantage in wavepacket transport can be removed by introducing disorder in the system .     as function of steps for d - dqw without pawl like effect in ( a ) and and with pawl like effect in ( b ) .",
    "we can see the increase in @xmath60 with pawl like effect along with a smaller standard deviation .",
    "[ fig : disorderedtransport ] ]    it is known that , random excitation or random coin operation ( which does not prefer any particular direction ) in d - dqw , is not able to give us directed transport in a preferred direction @xcite .",
    "but this random coin operation , helps us to localize the wavepacket , that is to say , standard deviation from the center of wavepacket , @xmath61 becomes less and the mean displacement will be zero .",
    "our scheme of introducing pawl effect gives directionality for a localized wavepacket .",
    "in figure[fig : disorderedtransport ] we show the probability distribution for d - dqw after different number of steps with pawl like effect . with increase in number of steps we can note a small shift of the probability distribution to the right . to quantify the wavepacket spreading and the shift in the mean position as function of steps , we shown the standard deviation and @xmath62 in inset ( i ) and ( ii ) of figure[fig : disorderedtransport ] for d - dqw with ( continuous line ) and without pawl ( dashed line ) like effect .",
    "we can note that the mean value which is zero for d - dqw without pawl like effect and is shown to grow up to @xmath63 with pawl like effect after 200 steps .",
    "the pawl like effect also contributes to the narrowed probability distribution ( smaller standard deviation ) .    from the above observation",
    "we can summarize that for standard dqw with pawl like effect , any value of @xmath64 gives us directional transport .",
    "small values of @xmath26 implies higher group velocity in eq.([grpvel ] ) and we get a localized peak with a higher @xmath65 value .",
    "as @xmath26 increases the peak lowers down while creating non - zero probability of occurrence at every position , which means decrease in @xmath65 . for a d",
    "- dqw with pawl like effect we will have a directed transport with a small increase in @xmath66 .     and @xmath67 . for ( a ) @xmath68 with @xmath69 and @xmath67",
    "are randomly picked with 1/2 probability for each step . for ( b ) @xmath68 with @xmath70 and @xmath67",
    "are randomly picked with 1/2 probability for each step . for ( c )",
    "@xmath68 with @xmath69 and @xmath67 are applied in order @xmath71 . in inset , sd and",
    "@xmath62 shows that the ordered combination of operations gives a better transport.[fig : randomcombtheta ] ]    using different combination of disordered and standard dqw evolition for different interval of time we can demonstrate the comtrol over the ratchet effect .",
    "mathematically this means that we choose two types of walk operator , namely @xmath68 and @xmath67 , and use them judiciously in a certain pattern to get a directed transport of wavepacket with significantly higher @xmath62 value .",
    "the two walk operators we choose are @xmath72 and @xmath73 where ,    @xmath74    in @xmath75 , @xmath26 once fixed is retained for all @xmath68 operations whereas , in @xmath76 , @xmath29 is chosen randomly for different time - step ( different for each @xmath67 ) . by choosing different order of applying operators @xmath68 and @xmath67 we can show that the control in the transport of the wavepacket can be optimized .",
    "for example , in figure[fig : randomcombtheta ] we show the probability distribution , standard deviation and @xmath62 for an @xmath77 step walk with pawl like effect using different order of @xmath68 and @xmath67 operation . by inspection we can note that the use of @xmath68 has resulted in the increase of @xmath62 ( 10 after 100 steps ) when compared to the evolution using only @xmath67 ( 6 after 100 step ) as shown in figure[fig : disorderedtransport ] .",
    "therefore , a well order combination of @xmath68 and @xmath67 can result in low standard deviation and high @xmath62 . in figure[fig : conpacttransport ] we show the well confined probability distribution with small standard deviation and large @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) . from this analysis",
    "we can conclude that by first choosing @xmath68 ( with @xmath80 ) for fixed number of steps of the walk we can ensure that the wavepacket is transported at the rate proportional to number of steps .",
    "the transported wavepacket is confined around the position by applying @xmath67 for a finite number of steps .",
    "note that introducing randomness in walk operator localizes the already spread out wavepacket around its mean position .",
    "this can be seen from the inset ( i ) where the standard deviation is slightly larger for the wavepacket with less number of @xmath67 operation((c ) in the probability distribution ) . from inset ( ii )",
    "we can note that the @xmath62 continues to increase with the operation @xmath68 and starts localizing when the operation @xmath67 starts acting on the system .",
    "therefore , a good combination of @xmath68 and @xmath67 can result in an efficient transport without spreading widely over the position space .    for a the evolution with combinaiton of operators @xmath68 followed by @xmath67 , the state of the system after time @xmath81 is given by , @xmath82 and this results in @xmath83 where @xmath26 is fixed coin operation in @xmath68 .",
    "^{50}[w_1]^{50}$ ] ( b ) @xmath84^{100}[w_1]^{100}$ ] and ( c ) @xmath84^{50}[w_1]^{160}$ ] where @xmath80 for @xmath68 .",
    "we can see an well confined transport @xmath85 .",
    "[ fig : conpacttransport ] ]",
    "in our model of ratchet we have not used any effect of noise that could take the pure state to the mixed state and decohere the system . therefore , quantum interference",
    "which plays an important role in dynamics of dqw continues to play an equally important role during ratchet effect in dqw .",
    "instantaneous density matrix of the system is described by , @xmath86     where @xmath26 for @xmath68 is @xmath87 .",
    "( e ) dqw with operations @xmath88 .",
    "for all the configuration we can note that the entanglement entropy after some time reaches a values closer to 1.[fig : entanglement ] ]    during dqw , the evolution of particle in superposition of position space creates entanglement between them . as we started with a pure initial state and whole walk operation is unitary , the system state always remain pure .",
    "thus , entanglement entropy is enough to give the accurate measure of entanglement .    partially tracing out with respect to space degrees , we have the reduced density matrix , @xmath89 = \\rho_c(t).\\ ] ] entanglement entropy is given by the formula , @xmath90\\ ] ] in figure[fig : entanglement ]",
    "we show the entanglement entropy as a function of number of steps for different configuration of the dqw evolution with and without pawl effect .",
    "for all the evolution with pawl effect we see that the entanglement entropy takes more time to get close to the maximum value when compared to the standard dqw and d - dqw without pawl .",
    "therefore , after large time , the transported wavepacket will exist in a saturated entangled state with the position space .",
    "in this paper we have proposed a quantum ratchet model using dqw .",
    "our configuration of fixed unitary coin operation at marked positions presents the effect of pawl .",
    "the probability distribution of the dqw , and d - dqw which spread symmetrically in position space takes a directed path when the pawl effect in the position space is introduced .",
    "we presented various configurations of the evolution operation which can be effectively used to optimize the combination of operations for maximum @xmath78 .",
    "we have found that the combination of evolution with sequence of fixed @xmath26 operations followed by the evolution operator with random @xmath26 can be optimized to maximize the @xmath62 with s small standard deviation of the distribution . as the walk evolution with and without disorder , and pawl effect",
    "is completely defined using a unitary operations our transported wavepacket remain coherent during the transport and we have shown this by calculating the entanglement entropy .",
