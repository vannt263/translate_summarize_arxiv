    "the abelian geometric phase in the sense of berry @xcite and pancharatnam @xcite , or non - abelian holonomies in the sense of wilczek and zee @xcite are associated with curves in a grassmann manifold @xcite , i.e. , the collection of all subspaces of a given dimension in a hilbert space .",
    "such curves may be realized in adiabatic evolution of a system dependent on external parameters @xcite or through a sequence of projective filtering measurements of observables @xcite . in these contexts ,",
    "non - abelian holonomies arise in cases where the parameter dependent hamiltonian is degenerate and where the measured observables have degenerate eigenvalues .",
    "the former scenario has attracted considerable attention in the literature @xcite and has recently been shown to be of relevance to robust quantum computation @xcite . while the latter approach to non - abelian holonomies has been discussed in the limit of dense sequences of projection measurements in ref .",
    "@xcite , a detailed analysis of the genuinely discrete non - abelian setting , analogous to pancharatnam s original discussion @xcite of the abelian geometric phase in the context of interference of light waves transmitted by a filtering analyzer , seems still lacking .    in this paper",
    ", we examine quantum holonomy in the discrete setting , and thus complement the study of holonomies in the continuous setting pursued in ref .",
    "we show that the discrete setting is `` rich '' in the sense that it admits more than one reasonable type of holonomy .",
    "we demonstrate two distinct holonomies that arise naturally in this context we shall call these discrete holonomies ` direct ' and ` iterative ' .",
    "although they are nonequivalent , the two types of holonomies nevertheless approach , in the limit of dense sequences , the wilczek - zee holonomy @xcite for closed paths , as well as its generalization @xcite for open paths , which appears to suggest that the extra richness of the discrete setting disappears in the continuous limit .",
    "furthermore , in order to ensure that the direct and iterative holonomies are reasonable , we formulate them in terms of interferometric procedures , thus making them meaningful in an operational sense .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the concepts of direct and iterative holonomies in the abelian case followed by their non - abelian generalizations .",
    "we show how the two holonomies can be associated with the internal degrees of freedom ( e.g. , spin ) of a particle in an ordinary two - path interferometer .",
    "section [ sec : partial ] contains an analysis of the case where one or several of the adjacent subspaces partially overlap , leading to the concepts of partial direct and iterative holonomies .",
    "an example involving sequential selections of angular momentum coherent states is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : cs ] .",
    "the paper ends with the conclusions .",
    "relative phases can be measured in interferometry as shifts in interference oscillations caused by local manipulations of the internal states of the interfering particles . in its simplest form , this can be realized for a pure internal input state @xmath0 that undergoes a unitary transformation @xmath1 in one of the interferometer arms .",
    "this results in an interference shift @xmath2 and visibility @xmath3 , where the former is the pancharatnam relative phase @xcite .",
    "the above interferometer scenario can be used to develop two different holonomy concepts that are associated with the geometry of a sequence of points in a grassmann manifold , i.e. , the set of @xmath4-dimensional subspaces of an @xmath5-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "these concepts we shall call the direct and iterative holonomies of the sequence . the former type of holonomy is direct in the sense that the whole operator sequence representing the points in the grassmannian is applied to the internal state in one of the arms of a single interferometer .",
    "the latter type of holonomy is iterative in the sense that it is built up in several steps , where each step involves an interferometer setup that depends on the preceding one . for one - dimensional ( @xmath6 ) subspaces , corresponding to sequences of pure states , the two holonomies are abelian phase factors , while for higher dimensional subspaces ( @xmath7 ) they correspond to non - abelian unitarities . in the following ,",

    "<S> abelian and non - abelian geometric phases , known as quantum holonomies , have attracted considerable attention in the past . here , we show that it is possible to associate nonequivalent holonomies to discrete sequences of subspaces in a hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> we consider two such holonomies that arise naturally in interferometer settings . for sequences approximating smooth paths in the base ( grassmann ) </S>",
    "<S> manifold , these holonomies both approach the standard holonomy . in the one - dimensional case the two types of holonomies are abelian and coincide with pancharatnam s geometric phase factor . the theory is illustrated with a model example of projective measurements involving angular momentum coherent states . </S>"
