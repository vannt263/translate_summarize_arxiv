    "the ga and in sesquioxides have recently been under intense scrutiny as , among others , uv absorbers and trasparent conductors . with a view at exploiting materials engineering concepts from other semiconductor systems , a growing body of work",
    "is being devoted to the ( ga@xmath0in@xmath8)@xmath7o@xmath2 alloy .",
    "theoretical studies on its phase stability and optical properties have been published recently by at least two groups @xcite , but the picture is apparently still far from complete .",
    "recent growth experiments @xcite on the ( ga@xmath0in@xmath8)@xmath7o@xmath2 alloy in the vicinity of @xmath3=0 and @xmath3=0.5 have suggested that phases other than those so far assumed as ground state may in fact be stable or stabilized by constrained ( e.g. epitaxial ) growth . in one paper @xcite ,",
    "three competing phases are reported to appear near @xmath3@xmath40.5 : a hexagonal phase previously observed at exactly @xmath3=0.5 ; a monoclinic close relative of the @xmath5-ga@xmath7o@xmath2 structure ; and that derived from the bixbyite structure of in@xmath7o@xmath2 , mostly in the form of phase - separated in and ga oxides .",
    "another paper @xcite reported that the @xmath6 phase of ga@xmath7o@xmath2 can be obtained at 820 k via epitaxial growth on gan , although a bulk phase transition to that phase from the ground state @xmath5 phase is not expected below 1500 k @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we report @xmath9 ) a phase diagram of ( ga@xmath0in@xmath8)@xmath7o@xmath2 accounting for new findings around @xmath3@xmath100.5 , and @xmath11 ) the polarization of the competing phases , plus the @xmath6-ga@xmath7o@xmath2 phase .",
    "the results are in a nutshell that @xmath12 ) the hex and @xmath5 structures do indeed compete energetically with the bixbyite phase expected based on previous results , and this competition occurs predominantly in the vicinity of @xmath3@xmath40.5 , giving rise to a fairly complex phase diagram with interlacing mixing and non - mixing concentration regions ; @xmath13 ) none of the alloy phases is polar , but the @xmath6 phase of ga@xmath7o@xmath2 is . as dictated by its symmetry , this phase ( only slightly energy - disfavored over the stable @xmath5 phase ) has a large spontaneous polarization and sizable piezoelectric coupling .",
    "importantly , it can not be transformed into ( is not symmetry - related to ) the stable @xmath5 phase .",
    "these results open up some interesting perspectives , such as growing the hex phase epitaxially , or exploiting the polarization properties of @xmath6-ga@xmath7o@xmath2 .",
    "geometry and volume optimizations as well as electronic structure calculations are performed using density - functional theory ( dft ) in the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) , and the projector augmented - wave ( paw ) method as implemented in the vasp code @xcite . in all calculations",
    "the cut - off is 471 ev and the force threshold is 0.01 ev /  . for all phases ,",
    "80-atom cells are used .",
    "the k - point summation grids are a @xmath14-centered 2@xmath152@xmath152 for the hexagonal phase and 4@xmath154@xmath152 for the @xmath6 phase ( 4@xmath154@xmath152 for the @xmath5 phase and 4@xmath154@xmath154 for the bixbyite structure as in ref . ) .",
    "the polarization is calculated via the berry - phase approach;@xcite the k - grid is a 4@xmath154 set of 16-point strings .",
    "phase coexistence is determined by the helmholtz mixing free energy per cation ( the enthalpy vanishes because the pressure is kept to zero to numerical accuracy in all calculations ) of the mixture as a function of @xmath3 , @xmath16 - f_{\\rm bulk},\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the internal energy calculated from first principles as just described , and @xmath18 = s_{\\rm mix}+s_{\\rm vib}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath19 the planck distribution and the mixture s debye temperature @xmath20(@xmath3 ) interpolated between the parent compounds .",
    "( the approximation of the vibrational entropy with that of a single - debye - frequency oscillator is admissible , as the growth temperatures are comparable to or higher than the debye temperatures @xmath21=420 k and @xmath22=870 k. ) the bulk free energy @xmath23 interpolates between the binary - compound values , calculated as for the alloy .",
    "we finally recall that a mixture separates into phases if the specific free energy is a negative - curvature function of @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath3 values where the curvature becomes negative and , respectively , goes back to positive ( i.e. the inflection points of the mixing free energy ) delimit the phase separation region ; these bounds , which may depend on temperature t , define a range known as miscibility gap .",
    "we first consider a hexagonal phase of ( ga@xmath0in@xmath8)@xmath7o@xmath2 .",
    "the motivation comes from recent growth experiments @xcite of ( ga@xmath0in@xmath8)@xmath7o@xmath2 near @xmath3@xmath40.5 , which revealed the appearance , besides @xmath5 and bixbyite crystal portions , of significant hexagonal microcrystallites .",
    "a candidate phase had been identified earlier on @xcite for ingao@xmath2 , and classified in the non - polar space group @xmath24/@xmath25 .",
    "this phase is depicted at @xmath3=0.5 in fig.[hex ] .     the hex structure at 50 - 50 concentration.,width=340 ]    both out of interest for its possible energetic stability , and for the possibility that the structure might become polar",
    ", we investigated this phase in the range @xmath3@xmath26[0.45,0.55 ] . in this region",
    "the hex phase is lower in energy than , and therefore favored over , the bixbyite and virtually degenerate at @xmath3=0.5 with the @xmath5 phase ( discussed below ) .",
    "we quantify this calculating the helmholtz mixing free energy by the model described above and in ref ..",
    "( as in previous work,@xcite large error bars are expected from the limited configurational sampling , but as errors should largely cancel out when comparing the various phases , we deem the relative energetics to be rather reliable . ) as shown in fig.[phdiag ] , bottom panel , we find that the lowest energy structures of the sample of configurations for the hex symmetry in the vicinity of @xmath3=0.5 are lower in mixing free energy by about 0.1 ev than the free - standing bixbyite configurational sample , and therefore more stable than the bixbyite alloy .      in previous work @xcite we found that the alloy adopting the @xmath5 structure of ga@xmath7o@xmath2 is disfavored over bixbyite for @xmath3 above 0.1 or so .",
    "the internal energy of that phase increases drastically and monotonically in that region of @xmath3 , so we refrained from pursuing it further .",
    "however , the same paper reporting the occurrence of hex phase crystallites also signaled @xmath5-phase inclusions near @xmath3=0.5 , so we revisited our previous assessment and studied the @xmath5 phase in that region of concentration .",
    "it turns out that at exactly @xmath3=0.5 the @xmath5 phase is more stable than bixbyite and as stable as the hex phase discussed above ( see fig.[phdiag ] , bottom ; a similar occurrence was reported in ref . ) . at this concentration , in atoms",
    "occupy all the octahedral sites , and ga atoms occupy all the tetrahedral sites .",
    "however , consistently with our previous conclusions , as soon as we move away from exact 50 - 50 concentration the energy shoots up immediately on both sides of the @xmath3=0.5 minimum , accompanied by a volume collapse ( mainly of the tetrahedra ) by over 10% at @xmath3=0.47 and @xmath3=0.53 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath5 phase itself should only occur at the `` magic '' 50 - 50 concentration , or in the vicinity of that concentration if one assumes that some other phase will take up the local cation excess .",

    "the lines are quadratic fits for hex and @xmath3@xmath40.5 , guides to the eye for bixbyite and low-@xmath3 @xmath5.,title=\"fig:\",width=340 ]      based on our calculations discussed above we provide an improved phase diagram accounting for the new phases .",
    "the diagram is reported in fig.[phdiag ] , bottom panel , as mixing free energy vs @xmath3 .",
    "the temperature is 800 k , a typical growth temperature .",
    "as shown previously,@xcite the phase boundaries are insensitive to temperature within our model , and hence apply to all practical growth temperatures . put differently ,",
    "the miscibility gaps and miscibility regions are persistent with temperature .    the stability of the @xmath5 phase only at low @xmath3 is confirmed , and so is the phase separation into components of the bixbyite phase in most of its own range ( signaled by the free energy being everywhere upward - convex except for @xmath3@xmath270.9 ) .",
    "what is new is that the hex phase is now the stable one in a range that , conservatively , extends from @xmath3@xmath40.4 to @xmath3@xmath40.6 .",
    "given its upward - concave free energy , the hex phase does not phase - separate into binary components in this range .",
    "in addition , as mentioned , the @xmath5 phase has a very narrow stability slot at @xmath3=0.5 .    as dictated by the curvature of the mixing free energy , there is full miscibility of the two binary oxides at all temperatures in the ranges @xmath3@xmath26(0,0.18 ) , @xmath3@xmath26(0.4,0.6 ) , and @xmath3@xmath26(0.9,1 ) , where , respectively , the @xmath5 , the hex , and the bixbyite structures are adopted .",
    "( these @xmath3 values correspond to the inflection points of the mixing free energy . ) in the rest of the @xmath3 range , separation into binaries is expected from the convex mixing free energy .    in the central region of the @xmath3 range ,",
    "there are several competing possibilities .",
    "the hex and @xmath5 mixed phases are obviously favored over the bixbyite alloy .",
    "but the latter should phase - separate into binary components , with in@xmath7o@xmath2 certainly adopting the bixbyite structure .",
    "ga@xmath7o@xmath2 may go either bixbyite or @xmath5 : in the first case , the energy ( from an interpolation between the end values ) is about 0.02 ev , i.e. falls between the @xmath5 alloy and the hex ; in the second case , the free energy is zero by construction , making phase separation at 50% slightly favored .",
    "these considerations , however , neglect internal interfaces , grain boundaries , strain effects in the binaries , and growth kinetics ( all of which are exceedingly complicated and well beyond our present scope ) , which will tend to disfavor phase separation .",
    "thus , at this level of accuracy , it seems very plausible that as experiments suggest the hex , @xmath5 , and phase - separated binaries will coexist in this region , depending on the growth conditions .    in fig.[phdiag ] , top panel , we also report the calculated fundamental gap in the stable phases in the regions where mixing occurs . the gap is calculated as difference of kohn - sham gga eigenvalues plus the empirical correction used in ref . to adjust the gap of the binaries to the experimental values . at low @xmath3 and at high @xmath3",
    "one expects optical absorption typical of ga@xmath7o@xmath2 and in@xmath7o@xmath2 , respectively . around @xmath3@xmath40.5 , the hex and @xmath5 alloy absorptions",
    "should be present ; since the bixbyite alloy phase separates , absorption may also be observed at energies typical of ga@xmath7o@xmath2 ( 4.5 - 4.7 ev ) and in@xmath7o@xmath2 ( 2.9 ev forbidden , 3.5 ev allowed ) ) ; so in the central @xmath3 region , distinct transitions may be expected at roughly 3.5 ev , 4 ev and 4.5 ev .",
    "one reason of interest in the hex phase is checking whether it distorts into a non - centrosymmetric symmetry group as a consequence of alloying .",
    "we investigate a range of alloying of between 43% and 57% , enabling all symmetry lowerings starting from @xmath24/@xmath25 .",
    "we find that the polarization is always numerically zero referred to the non - polar high - symmetry phase , and are thus forced to conclude that this structure , somewhat anticlimatically , is robustly non polar .",
    "in fact , our conclusion agrees with the symmetry determination of ref . at @xmath3=0.5 , and shows that this applies at generic concentrations in that vicinity .",
    "we also sampled the polarization in a few bixbyite and @xmath5 alloy samples , unsurprisingly finding them to be always zero ( referred to the cubic and monoclinic-@xmath5 phases ) .",
    "we therefore turned to another potentially polar phase of this system , @xmath6-ga@xmath7o@xmath2 , recently grown epitaxially on gan by oshima _",
    "the @xmath6 phase is structurally akin to the same phase of fe@xmath7o@xmath2 and its space group is @xmath28 , which does not contain inversion .",
    "we calculate its structural parameters , finding them in essential agreement with a previous study , @xcite and the energy difference with the @xmath5 phase at zero temperature , which is just 90 mev per formula unit .    at low enough temperature ,",
    "the epitaxial stabilization @xcite of the @xmath6 phase is not endangered by a possible decay in the @xmath5 ground state , for the simple reason that there is no possible @xmath6-to-@xmath5 symmetry path , since the two space groups are @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "this is quite analogous to the situation of wurtzite iii - v nitrides ( group @xmath30 ) which can not transform , again for symmetry reasons , into the close relative structure of zincblende ( group @xmath31 ) , despite the volume being almost the same and the energy difference being about only 10 mev / atom ( the two @xmath6 and @xmath5 phases also have the same volume and an energy difference of about 15 mev / atom ) . just as @xmath6-ga@xmath7o@xmath2 , zincblende nitrides can be grown under appropriate epitaxial constraints .",
    "polarization calculated along a path connecting the centrosymmetric parent phase to non - centrosymmetric @xmath6-ga@xmath7o.,width=340 ]    since the group @xmath28 does not contain inversion , observable polar vector quantities are allowed in @xmath6-ga@xmath7o@xmath2 .",
    "the polar axis is the @xmath32 axis , so we calculate the spontaneous polarization * p*=(0,0,p ) as difference of the polarizations calculated @xcite in this phase and in a symmetry - connected centrosymmetric parent phase ( we verified that the other components are indeed zero ) .",
    "the latter is chosen to have symmetry group @xmath33 ( a supergroup of @xmath28 ) .",
    "the evolution of p with a path connecting the two structures is in fig.[pvsdis ] .",
    "the final result is that @xmath6-ga@xmath7o@xmath2 has a remarkable p=0.23 c / m@xmath34 , a value similar to that of batio@xmath2 , a factor of 3 larger than of aln , and nearly a factor 10 larger than of gan .",
    "the structure of the @xmath6 phase is not structurally switchable ( in the same sense that wurtzite is not , though of course the polar axis can be inverted , again as in nitrides , by inverting the growth direction using e.g. a buffer layer ) ; therefore p is expected to mantain its orientation along the polar axis within any given crystalline domain .",
    "@xmath6-ga@xmath7o@xmath2 can thus be classified as a pyroelectric material , one more time like iii - v nitrides .",
    "the symmetry of the @xmath6-ga@xmath7o@xmath2 structure allows for five distinct piezoelectric coefficients ; here we calculate the diagonal coefficient @xmath35 as the finite - differences derivative of the polarization with respect to the axial strain @xmath36=(@xmath32@xmath37)/@xmath37 .",
    "the result is @xmath35=0.77 c / m@xmath34 , which is in line with typical coefficients of strongly polar semiconductors ( oxides and nitrides ) , although over an order of magnitude smaller than those of strong ferroelectrics ( see e.g. ref . ) .",
    "these results open up interesting perspectives .",
    "the polarization of @xmath6-ga@xmath7o@xmath2 can be exploited growing the oxide epitaxially on gan ( or , equivalently , growing gan on the oxide ) to build a high - mobility transistor .",
    "the polar axis of @xmath6-ga@xmath7o@xmath2 is found to be parallel to that of gan in growth experiments,@xcite so their polarizations are either parallel or antiparallel .",
    "since the polarization difference is very large in both cases , a correspondingly large polarization charge will appear at the gan/@xmath6-ga@xmath7o@xmath2 interface and thus attract free carriers ( provided by dopants , e.g. ) to form an interface - localized two - dimensional gas at potentially huge concentrations .",
    "the polarization difference across the interface , i.e. the polarization charge to be screened by free carriers , and hence the potentially - reachable local electron - gas concentration , is 0.2 to 0.26 c / m@xmath34 , i.e. 1.2 to 1.6@xmath1510@xmath38 @xmath39 ( for * p * vectors in the two materials being parallel or antiparallel , and neglecting possible interface traps , native charges , etc . ) .",
    "in addition , since the gap of @xmath6-ga@xmath7o@xmath2 is much larger than that of gan , the interface confinement should be quite efficient .",
    "finally , the sign of the polarization charge and hence of the accumulation layer will depend on the chosen polarity of the substrate .",
    "the above scenario is a `` writ - large '' version of the gan / algan hemts currently in use , whose high - frequency , high - power operation is enabled primarily by the high polarization - induced interface charge .",
    "of course , all else assumed to be equal , ga@xmath7o@xmath2/gan transistors could be much superior to algan / gan ones , which enjoy a much lower areal density of order 10@xmath40 @xmath39 .",
    "using density - functional ab initio theoretical techniques , we have revised the phase diagram of ( ga@xmath0in@xmath8)@xmath7o@xmath2 , showing that the @xmath5 phase is stable ( without phase separation into binary components ) at low @xmath3 and exactly at 50 - 50 concentration ; a new hexagonal phase is stable ( again without phase separation into binary components ) for @xmath3 from about 0.4 to 0.6 , where it is robustly non - polar ; and bixbyite will be favored for @xmath3 between 0.2 and 0.4 and upward of 0.6 , but should phase - separate into binary components . around @xmath3@xmath40.5 , the hex ,",
    "@xmath5 and phase - separated binary bixbyites should be closely competing .",
    "optical signatures are expected at around 4.6 ev at low @xmath3 ( @xmath5 phase ) , around 3.5 ev at large @xmath3 ( bixbyite ) , and at 3.5 , 4 , 4.5 ev from the competing phases at @xmath3@xmath40.5 .",
    "we have further studied the @xmath41-phase of ga@xmath7o@xmath2 , and confirmed it as the second most stable structure beside @xmath5-ga@xmath7o@xmath2 .",
    "we find it to have a large spontaneous polarization ( 0.23 c / m@xmath34 ) and a sizable diagonal piezoelectric coefficient ( @xmath35=0.77 c / m@xmath34 ) .",
    "symmetry dictates that this phase , once epitaxially stabilized , will not transform back into the ground - state @xmath5 , despite having the same volume and a small energy difference ; in this sense , the @xmath6-@xmath5 relation is similar to that between zincblende and wurtzite iii - v nitrides .",
