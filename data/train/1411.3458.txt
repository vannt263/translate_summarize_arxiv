    "the arches cluster is a young ( 2 - 4  myr ) , compact ( @xmath2  pc ) , and massive ( @xmath3  m@xmath1 ) star cluster located @xmath4  pc away from the galactic center ( gc ) in projection @xcite .",
    "this extraordinary cluster has been suspected to have had a shallower initial mass function ( imf ) or an elevated low - mass cutoff ( @xmath5 ) in the imf , compared to the imfs inferred for the galactic disk clusters because of the extreme environment of the gc , such as elevated temperatures and turbulent velocities in the molecular clouds , strong magnetic fields , and large tidal forces @xcite .",
    "the quintuplet cluster is another young ( 3 - 5  myr ) , massive ( @xmath6  m@xmath1 ) cluster in the gc area @xcite , but it is much less dense in number density than the arches , and thus it is more difficult to estimate its mass function from the photometry because of the confusion problem with the foreground and background stars . the arches cluster is an excellent target for understanding the effects of the star - forming environment on the imfs of star clusters .",
    "the first high - resolution photometry toward the arches was performed by @xcite using the infrared ( ir ) camera onboard the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) .",
    "they estimated the cluster s mass function ( mf ) down to @xmath7  m@xmath1 , which was the mass corresponding to the 50% completeness limit of their photometry , @xmath8 .",
    "this has been followed by several adaptive optics ( ao ) ir observations with a few ground telescopes .",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath9  m@xmath1 with the gemini telescope , and @xcite acquired @xmath10  m@xmath1 with the very large telescope ( vlt ) .",
    "@xcite obtained the lowest @xmath8 so far , 1.3  m@xmath1 , with the keck telescope .",
    "the imf estimated in kim et al .",
    "was only slightly shallower ( power - law exponent of @xmath11 to @xmath12 ) than the salpeter imf ( @xcite ; @xmath13 ) , and it did not indicate an elevated low - mass cutoff , at least not down to 1.3  m@xmath1 .",
    "resolving stars fainter than 1.3  m@xmath1 in the arches cluster will have to wait until the next - generation ir space telescope , such as the _ james webb space telescope _ , or an extremely large ground telescope , such as the giant magellan telescope , is available . in the present paper ,",
    "we devise a method to estimate the shape of the low - end mf , where the individual stars are not resolved , and apply it to the arches cluster .    in a conventional photometric method ,",
    "stars in the observed image are identified by fitting the point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "however , our goal here is to estimate the number distribution of stars fainter than the photometric completeness limit ( i.e. , the stars that are too faint to be fit with the psf ) .",
    "our new method involves the histogram of pixel intensities in the observed image .    in most star clusters ,",
    "faint stars are more abundant than bright ones .",
    "if the number of unresolved stars is large enough , they will have a non - negligible contribution to the pixel intensities and the number distribution of pixel intensities in the observed image .",
    "thus , the pixel intensity histogram ( pih ) of an observed image can give valuable information about unresolved , faint stars . with our method",
    ", we estimate the mf of the arches cluster below the photometric completeness limit by fitting the pihs of model images to the observed pih .    we first build a synthetic luminosity function ( lf ) for the cluster by combining the observed lf above the magnitude of the completeness limit ( limiting magnitude ) and a model lf , which is converted from a model mf below the limiting magnitude .",
    "we also build a synthetic lf for the fore / background stellar population toward the arches cluster using the milky way star - count model of @xcite .",
    "we then create an artificial image from these two synthetic lfs and compare the pih of this image to the observed pih .",
    "we try various model lfs below the limiting magnitude until we find satisfactory agreement between the synthetic and observed pihs .",
    "our new method does not directly yield an lf or mf of a cluster .",
    "however , it can be used to reject certain mfs , and we find that the imf of the arches cluster should not be too different from that for the galactic disk , such as the kroupa imf @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we describe the observational data and the photometric procedures used in the present study .",
    "we discuss the fore / background stellar population toward the arches cluster and the background flux in the observed images in  3 .",
    " 4 describes the procedures to search for the most plausible mf of the arches cluster .",
    "summary and conclusion are given in  5 .",
    "mosaic pattern . the background , a k@xmath14-band image from the 2mass @xcite , is to show that the three control fields have fairly uniform background emission levels . ]",
    "the imaging data of the arches cluster that we use in this study were obtained with the nicmos2 camera onboard the _ hst _ on ut",
    "september 13/14 , 1997 @xcite .",
    "we chose this data set among others not only because the psfs of space observations are relatively stable and well known , but also because this data set includes the images of control fields near the target cluster .",
    "the nicmos2 camera has a field - of - view ( fov ) of @xmath15 and @xmath16 pixels ( each pixel covers @xmath17 of the sky ) .",
    "the arches cluster was observed in a mosaic - pattern of @xmath18 , and three control fields were observed at a distance of @xmath19 from the center of the cluster field ( fig . [ location ] ) .",
    "all image data were taken with f110w , f160w , and f205w filters , but the present study makes use of only f205w images because they suffer the smallest extinction .",
    "the exposure time of all f205w images used in the present study is 256  s.    data were reduced using stsci pipeline routines , and psf photometry ( star - finding , psf - building , and psf - fitting ) was performed using the daofind and daophot packages @xcite within the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) .",
    "the conversion of the psf flux into the vega magnitude was done using the photometric keywords and zero - points announced on the stsci webpage .",
    "the photometry of faint stars is incomplete due to their low signals and confusion by nearby brighter stars .",
    "we estimated recovery fractions for each 0.5 magnitude bin by planting artificial stars on the images .",
    "the obtained lfs were corrected using the recovery fractions . in our analyses in the forthcoming sections ,",
    "only the portion of lf whose recovery fraction is higher than 50% is used .",
    "we adopted a distance modulus of 14.52 for the gc ( @xmath20  kpc ; @xcite ) and solar - metallicity isochrone at 2 myr of the geneva model @xcite for the conversion between the stellar magnitude and the mass .",
    "the reddening value of each star was estimated from the color excess in f160w@xmath21f205w color and the extinction law of @xcite .",
    "the average extinction estimated for the cluster was 2.9  mag in f205w .          before constructing the fore / background lf toward the arches cluster",
    ", we first constructed the synthetic lfs in each direction of the three control fields .",
    "for the magnitude bins brighter than the magnitude of @xmath22 completeness , @xmath23 , of each field ( 18.9 , 18.7 , and 18.6 mag for control fields a , b , and c , respectively ) , we adopted the completeness - corrected f205w lfs from each field .",
    "for the magnitude bins fainter than @xmath23 , we constructed model lfs by integrating the model number density of stellar objects within a given apparent k - mag range along the pencil - beam volume element in the direction of each control field . for the model number density",
    ", we used the star - count model of the milky way in the k band by @xcite , which considers 87 different stellar types and various galactic structures such as the disk , bulge , halo , and spiral arms ( here we assumed that the lfs in the k and f205w bands are adequately similar ) .",
    "the k magnitudes of stellar objects in the star - count model are reddened with an average extinction of 2.9  mag and observed standard deviations of 2.1 , 1.6 , and 1.8  mag for control fields a , b , and c , respectively .    .",
    "( lower panel ) pihs of the artificial images for the control field a that are constructed with the star - count models by @xcite and by @xcite . for the latter ,",
    "the model log lf was vertically shifted downward by 0.34 dex in order to match it with the observed lf at @xmath23 .",
    "[ test ] ]     ( corresponding to 0.12 , 0.23 , and 0.35  pc ) from the cluster center , which is marked with the cross.[annulus ] ]    ideally , the bright - part lf from the psf photometry and the faint - part lf from the star - count model should connect smoothly at @xmath23 .",
    "however , the faint - part logarithmic lfs were found to be @xmath24  dex higher than the bright - part log lfs at @xmath23 .",
    "this is thought to be because the star - count model by @xcite is not accurate enough , particularly toward the gc region , due to the large amounts of extinction .",
    "for this reason , we subtracted 0.31 , 0.28 , and 0.19  dex from the model log lfs of control fields a , b , and c , respectively , so the model lfs at @xmath23 match with the observed lfs .",
    "then we constructed the final synthetic lf by merging the bright - part lf from the psf photometry and the modified faint - part lf from the star - count model .",
    "the upper panels of figure [ control_hist ] show the completeness - corrected lfs from observations ( red lines ) , the model lfs modified ( shifted vertically as described above ) to match the observed lfs at @xmath23 ( blue lines ) , and the final synthetic lfs for the three control fields ( thick lines ) .",
    "we then constructed the artificial images using these synthetic lfs for each control field .",
    "for this , we first built a set of 64 model psfs at @xmath25 equally - spaced grid points of the detector plane using the tiny tim , a psf modelling tool .",
    "each model psf has @xmath26 pixels .",
    "then we planted artificial stars at random locations in the artificial images , using whichever of the 64 model psfs was closest to the location of the artificial star being planted .",
    "the magnitude of the artificial star was chosen randomly following the synthetic lf for each control field .",
    "a dark current of @xmath27 and readout noise with a standard deviation of @xmath28 were added to the artificial images .",
    "poisson uncertainties and a gain of @xmath29 [ conversion between the electrons and the data number ( dn ) ] were considered when adding the artificial stars , dark current , and background flux ( discussed below ) .    the final artificial image was completed by adding a proper background flux , which is rather difficult to estimate theoretically .",
    "the background flux includes telescopic thermal noise , zodiacal light , external galactic sources , and cosmic ir background .",
    "the instrument handbook of the nicmos camera predicts that thermal noise is the dominant background source , with an estimated flux of @xmath30  dn for an exposure of 256  s. however , the flux level from the thermal noise can vary over time , and the exact amount of background flux from the zodiacal light and cosmic ir background in the f205w band is not well known either .",
    "perhaps using the observed pihs themselves is the best way to estimate the background flux .",
    "the lower panels of figure [ control_hist ] show the faint ends ( dn smaller than 3,800 ) of the pihs .",
    "these faint - end pihs correspond to pixels that do not belong to the main body of any bright , resolved stars ( the peak dn of a star with @xmath23 is @xmath31 ) .",
    "the intensities in this part of a pih are mostly from various background sources and faint , unresolved stars .",
    "we found that adding a background flux of 1,190  dn resulted in a good match between the pihs from observed and artificial images for all three control fields .",
    "this demonstrates that we are able to reproduce the observed pihs in the directions of the three control fields with our procedures for constructing the fore / background stellar lf and artificial images , and that we are now ready to apply our procedures to the arches cluster to reveal the faint - part lf of the cluster itself .",
    "the background flux of 1,190  dn obtained for the control fields will be used for the cluster field in  4 as well .",
    "the faint - end pihs of our artificial images for the control fields are statistically stable against the random choices of magnitudes and positions for the artificial stars because the number of pixels with @xmath32 in the artificial images ( and thus in the observed images as well ) is large enough ( @xmath33-@xmath34 for the 50-dn bin ) .    to check",
    "if the pihs of our artificial images are dependent on the choice of the star - count model for the faint - part lf , we have also tried the star - count model by @xcite , which is a modified version of the model by @xcite .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ test ] compares the model lfs toward the arches cluster region by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "the shapes of the two lfs are quite similar at the faint - part ( below @xmath23 ) .",
    "although the lf by polido et al . is slightly higher at the magnitudes below @xmath23 , this does not matter much because we vertically shift the model lf anyway to match it with the observed lf at @xmath23 .",
    "the lower panel of figure [ test ] compares the pihs of the artificial images for the control field a that are constructed with the two star - count models , and the two pihs are nearly indistinguishable .",
    "this shows that our procedure of constructing the artificial images for fore / background stars is robust against the choice of star - count model for the faint - part lf .",
    "unlike in the control fields , in the cluster field the stellar number density and lf are highly position - dependent . at the center of the cluster ,",
    "confusion by bright stars is so significant that the contribution of the faint cluster stars to the pih is almost negligible . on the outskirt of the cluster ,",
    "the photometry is limited by the fore / background stars and the contribution of faint cluster stars to the pih becomes insignificant relative to the fore / background stars .",
    "thus the best region for a study of faint cluster stars is the intermediate region between the cluster center and the outskirt .",
    "we chose two annuli ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) for our analyses here .",
    "[ annulus ] ; we adopted the position of the cluster center used in @xcite ; note that @xcite estimates the tidal radius of the cluster to be @xmath37 .",
    "our stellar photometry and completeness test resulted in @xmath38  mag for @xmath35 and 17.4  mag for @xmath36 .",
    "as in the control fields , our synthetic lfs for the two cluster annuli are composed of two parts : the bright - part lf from our psf photometry for magnitude bins brighter than @xmath23 and the faint - part lf from a model for magnitude bins fainter than @xmath23 .",
    "the faint - part model lf consists of 1 ) the model lf for the fore / background stars and 2 ) the lf converted from a model mf for the cluster stars . for the fore / background model",
    "lf , we used the average of the three synthetic lfs for the control fields . for the cluster model",
    "lf , we tried the following two models : 1 ) lfs converted from single power - law mfs with various exponents and lower mass limits , and 2 ) lfs converted from the kroupa mf @xcite with various lower mass limits .",
    "we constructed artificial images for the two cluster annuli following the same procedure used for the control fields .",
    "however , the area covered by each cluster annulus is rather small , and we found that the shape of the faint - end pih depended slightly on the random choices of magnitudes and positions of bright artificial stars . therefore , we used the magnitudes and positions of the actual , observed stars when planting artificial stars brighter than @xmath23 instead of randomly selecting their magnitudes and positions from the observed lf .",
    "a background flux of 1,190  dn was applied to the artificial images for the cluster annuli , which is the value deduced from the control field images .      in this subsection , we describe our attempts with the single power - law mfs with various power - law exponents @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) and @xmath5 for the faint - part lf of the cluster .",
    "the upper panels of figure [ single_diff ] show some sample synthetic lfs for the @xmath35 annulus , whose faint - part cluster lfs are from the mfs with three different @xmath39 values ( left panel ) , and three different @xmath5 values ( right panel ) .",
    "the lower panels of figure [ single_diff ] plot the faint - end pihs of the observed image ( dotted lines ) and those of the artificial images constructed from the synthetic lfs in the corresponding upper panels ( solid lines ) .",
    "first , the heights of pihs from the artificial images are generally consistent with those from the observed image , implying that our procedure of constructing artificial images for the cluster field has no fundamental flaws .",
    "second , the turnover intensity of the pih clearly depends on the @xmath39 and @xmath5 values ( though it is less sensitive on small @xmath39 and large @xmath5 values ) .",
    "this second point demonstrates that the pihs can be used to reject or accept assumed faint - end lfs ( and thus mfs ) for the arches cluster .",
    "the few sample experiments shown in figure [ single_diff ] already imply that the best - fit @xmath39 and @xmath5 are around 2.2 - 2.3 and 0.1 - 0.3  m@xmath41 , respectively . to more quantitatively search for the @xmath39 and @xmath5 values that best fit the observed pih",
    ", we devised a statistic : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the numbers of pixels with an intensity ( dn ) @xmath45 in the observed and artificial images , respectively .",
    "the bracket indicates an average , and we chose to average only numbers with @xmath46 .",
    "this rather unusual statistic was adopted because the logarithmic shape of the pih better discerns different @xmath39 and @xmath5 values than the linear shape does .",
    "the color map of @xmath47 in the @xmath39-@xmath5 space for the two cluster annuli are shown in panels a and b of figure 5 .",
    "the minimum @xmath47 is near ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) for the inner annulus and near ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) for the outer annulus .",
    "the @xmath47 contours near the minima are rather elongated along the curves connecting the ( large @xmath39 , large @xmath5 ) and ( small @xmath39 , small @xmath5 ) corners because those curves have similar contributions ( roughly in numbers ) of faint stars to the faint - ends of the pihs .",
    "the simplest way to estimate the best - fit @xmath39 and @xmath5 values from the two annuli simultaneously is perhaps by adding the @xmath52 values from the two annuli .",
    "the sum of the two @xmath52 values has a minimum at ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) and has less elongated contours around the minimum ( fig .",
    "[ single_survey]c ) .",
    "our simple analyses with single power - law mfs imply that the present - day mf of the arches is not significantly different from the salpeter mf whether the two annuli are considered separately or simultaneously .     for annuli of @xmath35 ( upper panel ) and @xmath36 ( lower panel ) .",

    ". filled circles are for the two annuli together.[kroupa_survey ] ]      in this subsection , we use more realistic mf models for the faint - part lf of the cluster .",
    "we adopted the kroupa mfs @xcite with various @xmath5 as the initial mf of the cluster , and allowed them to dynamically evolve for 2  myr with the anisotropic fokker - plank ( f - p ) model of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the kroupa mf consists of three power - laws , @xmath48 for @xmath55  m@xmath1 , @xmath56 for @xmath57 , and @xmath58 for @xmath59  m@xmath1 .",
    "following @xcite , we adopted the following for the initial conditions of the f - p calculation : density and velocity dispersion structures from the king model , total mass of @xmath60  m@xmath1 , upper mass boundary of 150  m@xmath1 , tidal radius of 1.1  pc , and the king concentration parameter of 4 .",
    "figure [ kroupa_mf ] shows the kroupa imf with @xmath61  m@xmath1 and its evolved mf at 2  myr from our f - p calculation for the two cluster annuli .",
    "the mf at 2  myr is slightly steeper in the inner annulus , while it is slightly shallower in the outer annulus due to the mass segregation .",
    "the synthetic lfs are constructed in the same way as in  4.1 : the observed lf is adopted for the bright - part , and the faint - part lf is converted from the model mf and joined to the bright - part lf at @xmath23 .",
    "the artificial images are then created in the manner described in  4.1 .",
