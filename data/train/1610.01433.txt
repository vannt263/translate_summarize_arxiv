    "advantages such as higher spectral efficiency , adaptability to severe channel environments , and efficient implementation have brought orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) into wide applications in modern communications . to fully exploit these advantages in reality , we have to resolve some demanding issues  sensitivity to frequency synchronization errors , high peak - to - average power ratios , to name a few . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the frequency synchronization issue stemming specifically from phase noise .",
    "phase noise is a random process caused by the fluctuation within receiver and transmitter oscillators that are deployed to generate carrier signal for up - down conversion @xcite . in practice , free - running oscillators and phase - locked loops",
    "are widely used , for which phase noise is described by wiener process and gaussian process , respectively @xcite .",
    "an ofdm block , consisting of several symbols , is transmitted and received with orthogonal subcarriers . due to the interference of phase noise ,",
    "however , the orthogonality among subcarriers is lost , which causes a degraded performance in ofdm systems . indeed ,",
    "common phase error ( cpe ) and inter - carrier interference ( ici ) are two detrimental effects of phase noise .",
    "cpe causes subcarrier phase rotation that does not change within a transmitted ofdm block .",
    "in contrast , ici introduces different interference to different subcarriers in the same block , and thus exhibits noise - like characteristics @xcite .",
    "generally , a constant carrier frequency offset ( cfo ) also exists apart from phase noise . with many methods available for cfo correction ,",
    "herein we consider only phase noise estimation assuming cfo has been fixed ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "many works have studied phase noise estimation given known channel information , which is impractical because channel needs to be estimated as well .",
    "subsequently , joint estimation of phase noise and channel impulse is proposed ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "such joint estimation problem has been investigated as early as in @xcite .",
    "the least - squares estimator of channel impulse response is computed first ; then heuristically , a window function as a filter is applied to the obtained channel estimator to reduce its sensitivity from phase noise and cfo .",
    "to be statistically justified , maximum _ a posteriori _ channel estimator in @xcite has exploited the statistical properties of phase noise .",
    "but the authors use taylor expansion to approximate the nonlinear optimization objective function , which works only for small phase noise .",
    "a simple alternating optimization method for the joint estimation problem can be found in @xcite .",
    "the critical issue with that method is its failure to deal with the constraint of phase noise in each iterative sub - problem . supposedly , estimating phase noise and channel was hard to disentangle as previous works claimed . in @xcite ,",
    "an elegant formulation is proposed with phase noise and channel estimations unraveled .",
    "the authors replace the unimodular constraint on phase noise in the time domain with a relaxation assuming the magnitude of phase noise is relatively small .",
    "nevertheless , their method is computationally unstable with a singularity issue that renders the already approximated solution even more inaccurate . and",
    "recently , a method craftily using the spectral property of phase noise is provided for the frequency domain - formulated problem @xcite .",
    "based on @xcite , the separate phase noise estimation problem is solved by semidefinite programming ( sdp ) .",
    "this method woks fine when the number of subcarriers deployed in ofdm is not too large and phase noise arise in a small level . in reality , however , the number of subcarriers can be as large as tens of thousands , e.g. , in terrestrial television broadcasting system ( dvb - t2 ) @xcite .",
    "regarding the joint phase noise and channel estimation , there are basically two ways for this problem : time - domain @xcite and frequency - domain approaches @xcite . in this paper , we formulate the optimization problem in the time - domain representation and our contributions are as follows .",
    "first , we prove the equivalence of the frequency - domain approach and the time - domain approach to the problem formulation .",
    "it allows us to separate the joint estimation problem and to be focused on estimating phase noise . and",
    "using the majorization - minimization technique , we devise more efficient algorithms as opposed to solving an sdp as in @xcite .",
    "the efficiency and low - complexity of our proposed algorithms enable us to deal readily with much larger number of subcarriers .",
    "moreover , we offer an adaptive method for phase noise estimation considering that the joint estimation problem is underdetermined per se irrespective of the approach of formulation .",
    "to achieve this , dimensionality reduction has been adopted in @xcite to address either the underdetermined nature of the problem or the computational complexity .",
    "but the algorithms provided therein can not be easily extended to find the optimal reduced dimension . instead of adhering to a presumed dimension",
    ", we implement our developed algorithms combined with bayesian information criterion ( bic ) and opt for the solution that yields the minimal bic . this extra adaptability to various level of phase noise",
    "comes without incurring much computational burden as simulated examples demonstrate .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "we give the system model of ofdm with a description of phase noise in section [ sec : system_model_phase_noise ] . in section [ sec :",
    "lit_pne ] , the problem formulation is presented after a review of existing methods .",

    ". shows , using the given pct results in a staircase - like estimate ; loose though it may seem , it is actually beneficial when snr is limited , owing to the fundamental underdetermined issue of the original problem .",
    "in fact , tqm with opt - pct provides the same estimate as that of the benchmark  opt - pct in this case is @xmath211 .",
    "in contrast , tqm without pct turns out an estimate with many undesired peaks associated with larger mse .",
    "it implies , therefore , that with small phase noise and low snr , dimensionality reduction is recommended in order to achieve a relatively better performance .      a particular example for this case",
    "is shown in fig . .",
    "with the given pct , we can see that pnc , tqm , and lqm are still able to produce the same good estimate by and large , the resulting mse of which is 0.8349 .",
    "tqm without pct and tqm with opt - pct ( opt - pnc is @xmath212 here ) outperform their opponents though , with corresponding mse being 0.1550 and 0.1890 , respectively , which implies that dimension should not be reduced too much with high snr .",
    "particularly , no dimensionality reduction is recommended as it turns out that tqm without pct gives a lightly better estimate . by monte carlo simulations , however , tqm with opt - pct gives the minimal mse among all the methods ; see fig . .",
    "it should also be mentioned that this will pose a challenge to the benchmark pnc because it needs to deal with an sdp with size of 512 or even larger .",
    "more details will be illustrated in section [ ssec : algorithm_convergence ] .",
    "a major difference in this scenario from the previous one is that tqm without pct yields a phase noise estimate with some undesired peaks ; see fig . .",
    "the reason is that low snr renders the original problem more susceptible to the underdetermined issue  the same as the case of small phase noise and low snr in fig . .",
    "nonetheless , tqm with opt - pct gives a very good estimate outperforming other opponents ; the resulting mse for the five methods in order are 22.7332 , 22.7333 , 22.7374 , 37.2954 , and 4.7228 .",

    "fast fourier transforms ( fft ) is employed , wherever it is possible , to improve computational efficiency .",
    "lqm costs more cpu time when @xmath23 is large . but",
    "some efficient acceleration schemes can be used to boost the convergence rate , e.g. , the squarem method @xcite .      in this last example , all the five algorithms yield nearly good estimates as fig .",
    "shows . fixed pct for pnc , tqm , and lqm ,",
    "however , still provide a relatively loose result that could have been improved with available high snr , the mse of which are 23.9709 , 23.9709 , and 23.9668 , respectively .",
    "we can also expect that tqm without pct and tqm with opt - pct perform better , the resulting mse of both is 0.6284 .",
    "opt - pct in this example is @xmath214 , which is simply an identity matrix , i.e. , no dimensionality reduction is applied .",
    " show averaged mse of phase noise and channel estimates with 500 monte carlo trials . from fig . and",
    ", we see that pnc , tqm , and lqm are comparable to each other with dimensionality reduction when snr is low . in contrast , tqm without pct can provide much better phase noise estimates for high enough snr .",
    "a similar result can be found for channel estimation , where the resulting mse has also been significantly improved with tqm ; see fig . and",
    ". generally speaking , tqm produces better estimates with opt - pct than without pct . and a closer look will reveal that as snr grows larger , performance gap between these two methods shrinks . and even though the benchmark pnc can deal with larger snr , the computational burden will be prohibitive , not to say the additional computational issues ; see the following remark and an illustration of cpu time consumed by each algorithm in section [ ssec : algorithm_convergence ] .    _",
    "remark : _ pnc is proposed in @xcite , where the original problem is reformulated as an sdp by using the s - procedure . the authors only prove the equivalence ( strong duality ) between the reduced problem and its sdp reformulation . for the original problem ,",
    "however , the strong duality has not been established . from simulations ,",
    "the resultant estimate of frequency - domain phase noise vector is not a reasonably good solution that satisfies the spectral constraint .",
    "also , solving an sdp only gives an intermediate solution that requires an additional eigendecomposition step .",
    "pnc can thus easily fall within infeasibility and singularity issues when dimension is not reduced enough .",
    "these issues , however , have not been addressed in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they have not given an explicit comparison in their paper about the mse of phase noise or channel estimates  although they are optimizing such objectives  but show the bit - error - rate ( ber ) after channel encoding / decoding .",
    "also , what they have simulated involves data detection , whereupon iterations are performed among phase noise estimation , channel estimation , and data detection .      in this section ,",
    "we first present an example of convergence properties of our proposed algorithms , and then give a comparison of cpu time consumed by each algorithm .",
    "convergence criteria defined previously apply here as well .    fig .",
    "[ fig : cvg_td_mm ] demonstrates convergence of four methods .",
    "tqm and lqm converge to the same optimal solution with the same initialization no matter pct is applied or not .",
    "tqm , however , converges remarkably much faster than lqm , within twenty iterations or fewer .",
    "this is because tqm employs a much tighter majorization function to the original objective function . in consequence ,",
    "we adopt tqm with opt - pct in previous simulations to achieve the same performance with respect to estimation error and to save much computation time at the same time . on the other hand ,",
    "as shown in previous examples , applying pct in the case of large phase noise and high snr causes loss of quality in the obtained estimates , which is substantiated by the fact that without pct , much lower objective value can be achieved .",
    "a further comparison in terms of the computational complexity between our proposed algorithms and the benchmark methods is provided in table [ tab : cpu_time ] .",
    "except lqm , our proposed algorithms consume less time than the benchmarks . in the case with",
    "pct applied , our proposed algorithms outperform pnc and altmm by saving much time and at the same time achieve the same mse of phase noise and channel estimates as shown in the previous examples .",
    "tqm gives as the same estimate as lqm ; however , it is much more efficient owing to the tighter majorization function . despite extra time cost without pct , tqm with opt - pct",
    "offer the best estimate among all the methods ; still , it consumes much less time than the benchmarks .",
    "in fact , when snr is high enough , e.g. , @xmath215 db here , tqm without pct can still significantly improve the resulting mse , which makes it an acceptable candidate as a suboptimal method .",
    "we present two more examples featuring fewer subcarriers deployment and the other phase noise model suggested in the literature .      following previous examples of estimating phase noise that is modeled as a wiener process",
    ", we show how those algorithms work with fewer subcarriers deployed .",
    "displays the averaged mse of phase noise estimates with @xmath216 .",
    "expectedly , the result is similar to that of fig . and in spite of either the number of subcarriers or magnitude of phase noise .",
    "still , tqm with opt - pct yields much better channel estimates than the benchmark , which corroborates the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms .",
    "phase noise generated in a phase - locked loop is modeled as a gaussian process @xcite . in this example",
    ", the number of subcarriers is @xmath216 with baseband sampling rate @xmath217 mhz .",
    "the standard deviation @xmath218 of phase noise generated by a phase - locked voltage controlled oscillator is 2 degrees .",
    "the single - pole butterworth filter with 3-db bandwidth @xmath219 hz is adopted so that the covariance matrix of phase noise is @xmath220 an instance of gaussian phase noise and its estimates is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gaussian_phase_noise_pn3db_500hz_snr_35_nc512 ] .",
    "as its name indicates , gaussian phase noise will not drift away too much like wiener phase noise .",
    "similar to fig . and , large dimensionality reduction induces considerable loss in the obtained estimates ; with pct , mse for pnc , tqm , and lqm are 1.4049 , 1.4049 , and 1.4024 , respectively .",
    "tqm without pct and tqm with opt - pct achieve the best performance in this example , both of which have the same mse of 0.1556 .",
    "and opt - pct is just an identity matrix , which causes no dimension to be reduced .",
    "show mse of the obtained estimates of gaussian phase noise and channel , respectively .",
    "still , our proposed algorithms can provide much better estimates as in the previous examples with wiener phase noise .",
    "we have proposed two efficient algorithms and a method with dimensionality reduction coupled with the bayesian information criterion for the joint phase noise and channel estimation in ofdm .",
    "the algorithms are devised based on the majorization - minimization technique and applied to two canonical models of phase noise  wiener process and gaussian process .",
    "the simulation results have shown that when the same dimensionality reduction is employed , our proposed algorithms achieve the same mse as that of the benchmark but consume much less time . by further selecting the optimal dimensionality reduction with bic ,",
    "our proposed algorithms provide significantly better estimates when snr is at least moderate but still demand no much additional computation time .",
    "therefore , the advantage of our methods should be outstanding in modern applications of ofdm , where a large number of subcarriers are deployed .",
    "in the following , the constraint of phase noise is taken into account and the alternating optimization scheme is correspondingly modified .    with the unimodular constraint for @xmath87",
