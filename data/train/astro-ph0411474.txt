    "the origin of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is a fundamental problem in astrophysics because the stellar imf determines photometric properties of galaxies and the dynamical and chemical evolutions of their interstellar medium . in this contribution",
    "we address the relation between statistical properties of turbulence and the origin of the stellar imf as discussed in padoan & nordlund ( 2002 , 2004 ) .",
    "the main result of these works is that the power law slope , @xmath2 , of the stellar imf measured by @xcite is the consequence of the turbulent nature of the star  forming gas and is directly related to the turbulent power spectrum slope , @xmath3 , @xmath4 . from this point of view",
    "it is not surprising that the origin of salpeter s result has remained mysterious for half a century , as our understanding of turbulence has not improved much since the seminal work by @xcite .",
    "the situation has changed during the last decade , because ever increasing computer resources have recently allowed significant progress in both fields of turbulence and star formation .    since salpeter s work , the stellar imf has been measured successfully in many systems .",
    "we now know that the imf in young clusters ( e.g. chabrier 2003 ) reaches a maximum at a fraction of a solar mass , and then turns around with a relative abundance of brown dwarfs ( bds ) that may vary from cluster to cluster ( e.g. luhman et al .",
    "the work we present here explains also this feature of the imf as a consequence of the supersonic turbulence in the star ",
    "forming gas .    using the properties of supersonic turbulence we have derived from recent numerical simulations , we predict the stellar imf essentially without free parameters .",
    "this predicted imf is shown to depend on the rms mach number , mean density and temperature of the turbulent flow .",
    "it is also shown to agree well with salpeter s imf for large stellar masses and with the low mass imf derived for young stellar clusters .",
    "our view of the imf as a natural property of supersonic turbulence in the magnetized and isothermal star ",
    "forming gas provides an explanation for the origin of bds as well .",
    "according to this picture , bds may be formed in the same way as hydrogen  burning stars .",
    "the velocity power spectrum in the inertial range of turbulence ( between the scales of energy injection and viscous dissipation ) is a power law , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the wave  number .",
    "the spectral index is @xmath7 for incompressible turbulence ( kolmogorov 1941 ) , and @xmath8 for pressureless turbulence ( burgers 1974 ; gotoh & kraichnan1993 ) . in recent numerical simulations of isothermal , super  alfvnic and highly supersonic magneto ",
    "hydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence we have obtained a power spectrum intermediate between the burgers and the kolmogorov power spectra ( boldyrev , nordlund & padoan 2002 ) and consistent with the prediction by @xcite , @xmath9 .    the probability density function ( pdf ) of gas density in isothermal turbulent flows is well approximated by a log  normal distribution with moments depending on the rms mach number of the flow ( nordlund & padoan 1999 ; ostriker , gammie & stone 1999 ) .",
    "the density structure is characterized by a complex system of interacting shocks resulting in a fractal network of dense cores , filaments , sheets and low density  voids ",
    ", with a large density contrast .",
    "most of the mass concentrates in a small volume fraction ( according to the log  normal pdf ) , a manifestation of the intermittent nature of the turbulence .",
    "an example of a projected turbulent density field is shown in figure  [ fig0 ] .",
    "a simple model of the expected mass distribution of dense cores generated by supersonic turbulence has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "the model is based on two assumptions : i ) the power spectrum of the turbulence is a power law ; ii ) the typical size of a dense core scales as the thickness of the postshock gas .",
    "the first assumption is a basic result for turbulent flows and holds also in the supersonic regime ( boldyrev et al .",
    "the second assumption is suggested by the fact that postshock condensations are assembled by the turbulent flow in a dynamical time .",
    "condensations of virtually any size can therefore be formed , independent of their jeans mass .    with these assumptions , together with the jump conditions for mhd shocks",
    ", the mass distribution of dense cores can be related to the power spectrum of turbulent velocity , @xmath5 : @xmath10 if the turbulence spectral index @xmath3 is taken from the analytical prediction by @xcite , which is consistent with the observed velocity dispersion  size larson relation ( larson 1979 , 1981 ) and with our numerical results ( boldyrev et al .",
    "2002 ) , then @xmath11 and the mass distribution is @xmath12 , almost identical to salpeter s stellar imf ( salpeter 1955 ) .",
    "the exponent of the mass distribution is rather well constrained , because the value of @xmath3 for supersonic turbulence can not be smaller than the incompressible value , @xmath13 ( slightly larger with intermittency corrections ) , and the burgers case , @xmath14 . as a result",
    ", the exponent of the mass distribution is predicted to be within the range of values of 1.3 and 1.5 .    while massive cores are usually larger than their critical bonnor ",
    "ebert mass , @xmath15 , the probability that small cores are dense enough to collapse is determined by the statistical distribution of core density .",
    "in order to compute this collapse probability for small cores , we assume i ) the distribution of core density can be approximated by the    log  normal pdf of gas density and ii ) the core density and mass are statistically independent . because of the intermittent nature of the log - normal pdf , even very small ( sub  stellar ) cores have a finite chance to be dense enough to collapse . based on the first assumption",
    ", we can compute the distribution of the critical mass , @xmath16 , from the log  normal pdf of gas density assuming constant temperature ( padoan , nordlund & jones 1997 ) .",
    "the fraction of cores of mass @xmath17 larger than their critical mass is given by the integral of @xmath18 from 0 to @xmath17 .",
    "using the second assumption of statistical independence of core density and mass , the mass distribution of collapsing cores is @xmath19\\,{\\rm d}\\ln m ~. \\label{imfpdf}\\ ] ] this mass distribution is a function of the rms mach number , mean density and temperature of the turbulent flow , as these parameters enter the pdf of gas density and thus @xmath18 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] ( left panel ) shows five mass distributions computed from equation ( [ imfpdf ] ) with three different values of the sonic rms mach number and two different values of density .",
    "@xcite have suggested that bds may originate from the process of turbulent fragmentation like hydrogen  burning stars .",
    "this is illustrated by the analytical imf in the left panel of figure  [ fig1 ] , which shows a relatively large abundance of bds is predicted for sufficiently large values of the mean density or rms mach number .",
    "the imf of the cluster ic 348 in perseus , obtained by @xcite , is plotted in the right panel of figure  [ fig1 ] ( solid line histogram ) . the imf of this cluster has been chosen for the comparison with the theoretical model because it is probably the most reliable observational imf including both bds and hydrogen burning stars . in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "we have also plotted the theoretical mass distribution computed for @xmath20  @xmath21 , @xmath22  k and @xmath23 .",
    "these parameters are appropriate for the central @xmath24  arcmin of the cluster ( @xmath25  pc ) , where the stellar density corresponds to approximately @xmath26  @xmath21 .",
    "the figure shows that the theoretical distribution of collapsing cores , computed with parameters inferred from the observational data , is roughly consistent with the observed stellar imf in the cluster ic 348 .",
    "similar imfs have been obtained for several other young clusters ( chabrier 2003 ) .",
    "we have proposed to explain the stellar imf as a property of supersonic turbulence .",
    "this scenario is very different from previous theories of star formation ( see shu , adams & lizano 1987 ) , where it is assumed that stars of small and intermediate mass are formed from sub ",
    "critical cores evolving quasi ",
    "statically , on the time ",
    "scale of ambipolar drift .",
    "these theories do not account for the ubiquity of turbulence in star  forming clouds and therefore ignore the effect of turbulence in the fragmentation process .",
    "a naive interpretation of our results may lead to the conclusion that the stellar imf at large masses should be a universal power law , with a slope very close to salpeter s value .",
    "the statistics of turbulence controlling the origin of the stellar imf are indeed universal ( they depend on _ flow _ properties such as the rms mach number , not _ fluid _ properties , and are insensitive to initial conditions that are soon `` forgotten '' due to the chaotic nature of the turbulence ) . however , such statistics are derived from ensemble averages . according to our derivation ,",
    "massive stars originate from shocks on relatively large scales . in any given system ( for example a molecular cloud )",
    "the number of large scale compressions ( thus the number of massive stars ) is relatively small . because of the small size of the statistical sample and because of the intermittent nature of the turbulence , large deviations from salpeter s imf are possible in individual systems .",
    "salpeter s imf is therefore a universal property of supersonic turbulence , but it is not necessarily reproduced precisely in every star  forming region ."
