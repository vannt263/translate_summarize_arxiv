    "in quantum key distribution ( qkd ) , two legitimate users of the system , alice and bob , attempt to generate a shared encryption key in such a way that the laws of quantum mechanics prevent an unauthorized eavesdropper , eve , from obtaining the key without revealing her presence . restricting ourselves here to systems that use pairs of entangled photons ,",
    "the most common approach is the ekert protocol @xcite , which is itself an entangled version of the earlier bb84 protocol @xcite .",
    "an embodiment of this approach using photon polarization works as follows .",
    "alice and bob each receive half of the entangled pair from a common source . often the source is in alice s lab , but it may be under the control of a third party ( or even under the control of eve herself ) .",
    "as the photons arrive , alice and bob each randomly choose one of two bases in which to make a linear polarization measurement .",
    "one basis consists of horizontal and diagonal polarization states ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) , the other involves diagonal states ( @xmath2 ) and ( @xmath3 ) polarized at @xmath4 from the horizontal and vertical .",
    "they then communicate on a classical ( possibly public ) channel in order to compare their bases ( but not the results of their measurements ) , discarding those trials in which they used different bases .    in the simplest possible eavesdropping attack , eve also makes a polarization measurement of one photon as it is en route to bob",
    ". she must guess randomly which measurement basis to use .",
    "if she guesses correctly , measuring in the same basis as alice and bob , then she gains full information about the polarization state and therefore has complete information about the state of the corresponding key segment .",
    "half of the time she guesses incorrectly , in which case her outcome is completely random and uncorrelated with alice s result .",
    "when she sends on the photon , bob s results will also be completely randomized in the original basis .",
    "this disturbance in bob s results allows eve s actions to be revealed .",
    "alice and bob randomly select a subset of their results for a security check , exchanging the results of their measurements as well as the basis used on these trials . if eve intercepts a fraction @xmath5 of bob s photons she introduces an error rate of @xmath6 between alice s outcomes and bob s in the security - checking subset .",
    "the polarization states have an effective hilbert space of dimension 2 , allowing a single bit of the key to be extracted in each polarization measurement .",
    "there have been a number of attempts to generalize the procedure above with other physical degrees of freedom that have higher - dimensional effective hilbert spaces , thereby allowing more than one bit of the key to be generated per photon @xcite , as well as improved ability to detect eavesdroppers .",
    "one particularly promising way @xcite to achieve this goal is to use the photon s orbital angular momentum ( oam ) @xcite instead of polarization .",
    "the oam about the propagation axis is quantized , @xmath7 , where the topological charge @xmath8 can take on any integer value .",
    "if a range of oam values of size @xmath9 is used as the alphabet ( for example @xmath10 or @xmath11 for even @xmath9 ) , then each photon can be used to determine up to @xmath12 bits of the key .",
    "although in principle such schemes allow unlimited numbers of bits per photon , their experimental complexity increases rapidly with increasing @xmath9 . for the most part we will work in this paper with arbitrary @xmath9 , but in order to make the discussion more concrete we will at some points restrict ourselves to an alphabet of size @xmath13 ( capable of achieving @xmath14 bits per photon ) .",
    "the generalization to higher values of @xmath9 is straightforward .    in @xcite , an approach to high - dimensional qkd",
    "was proposed based on a novel entangled light source @xcite that produces output with absolute values of the oam spectrum restricted to the fibonacci sequence .",
    "( recall that the fibonacci sequence starts with initial values @xmath15 and @xmath16 , generating the rest of the sequence via the recurrence relation @xmath17 . )",
    "these states pump a nonlinear crystal , leading to spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) , in which a small proportion of the input photons are split into entangled signal and idler output photons .",
    "after the crystal , any photons with non - fibonacci values of oam are filtered out .",
    "angular momentum conservation and the fibonacci recurrence relation conspire to force the two output photons to have oam values that are adjacent fibonacci numbers ( for example @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) .",
    "these photons can then be used to generate a secret key , as detailed in the next section .",
    "the fibonacci protocol requires the ability to distinguish between single oam eigenstates and pairwise superpositions of eigenstates .",
    "this can not be done unambiguously on a single trial ; however , as shown in @xcite , an interferometric approach allows statistical discrimination of the possibilities over multiple trials .",
    "using this approach , we show in this paper that the outcome probability distributions can be built up in such a way that eavesdropping alters them in a detectable manner . in this way",
    ", an eavesdropper can be revealed over multiple trials even though it may not be possible to identify errors on any individual trial .",
    "this is especially important because even without eavesdropping there is some probability of error in discriminating between states in individual trials , due to the non - orthogonality of the relevant superposition states .",
    "this complication must be dealt with in the reconciliation stage .",
    "bb84 and most other protocols rely on the rate of errors in individual outcomes for security , but here we must rely on statistical changes wrought by the eavesdropper s actions over many trials . as a result , rather than using eavesdropper - induced error rates as a measure of eavesdropper detection , it is more appropriate here to use probability - based measures such as the disturbance @xmath20 @xcite , which is defined in section [ probsection ] .",
    "section [ setupsection ] reviews the procedure for implementing the fibonacci protocol in the context of oam measurements .",
    "the effect of eavesdropping is examined in section [ evesection ] .",
    "details of the means of dealing with the superposition states are described in section [ supersection ] , with calculations of various measures of security carried out in section [ probsection ] and conclusions in section [ conclusionsection ] .",
    "a brief discussion of key reconciliation over a classical channel is given in appendix a , and detailed expressions for the probability distributions of outcomes for the protocol appear in appendix b.",
    "here , we review the fibonacci protocol @xcite .",
    "the protocol discussed here is a slightly improved variation on the original proposal of @xcite , making use of the apparatus described in more detail in @xcite .",
    "note that no trials need to be discarded in the scheme described , aside from those used for security checking .",
    "this is in contrast to the original version of the fibonacci protocol @xcite where @xmath21 of the trials were discarded during reconciliation and the bb84/ekert protocol , where @xmath22 must be discarded .",
    "the fibonacci protocol allows multiple key bits to be generated per photon .",
    "the required basis modulation can be done in a completely passive manner , and switching only has to be done between two fixed bases , so that the complexity of the setup increases much more slowly with increasing @xmath9 than in other oam - based qkd methods , such as @xcite .",
    "the basic setup is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ setupfig ] .",
    "the source on the left ( see @xcite for more detail ) uses a down conversion source and scattering from an aperiodic spiral nanoarray @xcite to create an entangled superposition of states with fibonacci - valued oam states in the two output directions : @xmath23 where the index @xmath24 runs over the indices of the allowed fibonacci numbers in the pump beam : @xmath25 alice and bob each receive one photon from the entangled pair . in each of their labs",
    "is a 50/50 beam splitter which randomly directs the photon to one of two types of detection stages .",
    "the stage labeled `` @xmath26-type '' detection consists of an oam sorter @xcite followed by a set of single - photon detectors .",
    "the oam sorter sends oam eigenstates with different @xmath8 values into different outgoing directions , so that they will be registered in different detectors , thus allowing @xmath8 to be determined . the other type of detection ( labeled `` @xmath27 type '' )",
    "is used to distinguish different superpositions @xmath28 of the form latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    the detection of such superposition states can be accomplished in several ways @xcite .",
    "one complication with the @xmath27-type detection is that adjacent superposition states , such as @xmath30 and @xmath31 are not orthogonal , meaning that the two states can not be unambiguously distinguished from each other .",
    "this adds complications to the classical exchange and alters the corresponding detection probabilities ; however we will see below that this extra complication is well compensated by increased the key - generating capacity .",
    "moreover , the degree of complication does not grow with the size of the alphabet used , so that the benefits outweigh the complications by a larger amount as the range of @xmath8 values increases .",
    "it is necessary to keep the possible key values uniformly distributed , so that eve ca nt obtain any advantage from knowledge of the nonuniform distribution . to do this",
    "it will be necessary to make sure that the spectrum of signal and idler values is broader than the alphabet of values actually used for the key , since the nonorthogonality of the superposition states means that measurements can broaden the range of outgoing values ( see section [ evesection ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that photons are lost from the setup only once , in the filtering after the crystal ; the spiral before the crystal simply redistributes the energy among the available modes through interference effects , with no net loss of photons or energy . as a result",
    ", event rates should be at levels comparable to other entangled photon protocols .    for illustration purposes",
    ", we will often restrict ourselves to the case @xmath13 .",
    "assume that the pump spectrum is broad enough to be approximately flat over a sufficient span to produce signal and idler oam values of uniform probability over the range @xmath32 to @xmath33 , for some @xmath34 .",
    "the outcomes for @xmath26-type detection ( oam eigenstates ) that will be used for key generation by alice and bob are then simply @xmath35 are chosen , then the utilized states are latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }         the outcomes for @xmath27-type detection ( two - fold oam superposition states ) used by alice and bob for key generation run from @xmath37 to @xmath38    detection either of the states @xmath39 or @xmath40 by alice will correspond to a key value @xmath41 . unfortunately , alice and bob will not necessarily agree on the same key unless further classical information is exchanged to reconcile their values .",
    "one possible method for reconciliation is discussed in appendix a.",
    "if an eavesdropper is acting on the photon heading to bob , she does not know which type of detection ( @xmath27 or @xmath26 ) will occur in alice s and bob s labs .",
    "if alice detects an eigenstate , then the state arriving at bob s end should be a superposition , whereas if alice detects a superposition then the state heading toward bob should be an eigenstate . if eve makes a @xmath27-type measurement when bob s photon is in an @xmath26 state or if she makes an @xmath26-type measurement when bob s photon is in a @xmath27 state , a disturbance is made in the statistical distribution of alice and bob s joint outcomes , which will become apparent when he compares a random subset of his trials with alice s . in more detail :",
    "\\(i ) suppose eve makes a @xmath27-type measurement on a photon which is actually in the eigenstate @xmath42 .",
    "she will detect one of the two superpositions @xmath43 or @xmath44 , each with @xmath45 probability , and send on a copy of it .",
    "if bob receives one of these superpositions and makes an @xmath26 measurement , he will see one of the values @xmath18 , @xmath46 , or @xmath47 , with respective probabilities of @xmath48 , @xmath21 , @xmath21 . in eve",
    "s absence , he should only see @xmath18 with @xmath49 probability ( see fig .",
    "[ outcome_eig_fig ] ) .",
    "[ outcome_eig_fig ]    \\(ii ) on the other hand , suppose eve makes an @xmath26-type measurement on a photon which is actually in the superposition state @xmath50 .",

    "[ outcomesfig ] ) .",
    "thus , it seems that bob sees the same result whether eve interferes or not .",
    "however , by adding an additional interferometric element to the setup , we will see ( section [ supersection ] ) that bob will be able to distinguish between the two cases",
    ".    it will be desirable to arrange the probabilities of the possible outcomes into a matrix .",
    "however , as seen above , the process of measurement can cause the range of states present in the system to spread .",
    "states that are within the range of our alphabet can lead to measurements outside the allowed range ( for example , the in - range state @xmath53 can be measured as the out - of - range @xmath54 , since these two states have nonzero overlap ) .",
    "similarly , states that are initially outside the desired range can lead to in - range measurements .",
    "this spreading is greater when eve is present and introducing additional measurements .",
    "so to account for this and to maintain the uniform distribution of key values , we allow states beyond the desired range to propagate in the system and include additional rows and columns in the probability matrix to describe the probability that the measured state is out of range of the allowed alphabet",
    ". this will be seen explicitly in section [ probsection ] and appendix b. note that we only need to include events in which at least one of the legitimate participants sees a value out of range ; we can exclude events where the measurements are out of range for both of them .",
    "the discrimination of oam eigenstates in the @xmath26 basis is straightforward and simply requires an oam sorter .",
    "discrimination of superposition states in the @xmath27 basis is more complicated .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the setup of figure [ cdfig ] is capable of sorting the superposition states .",
    "a pair of photon - counting detectors @xmath55 and @xmath56 is used at the output ports of the final nonpolarizing beam splitters . if @xmath55 fires during the key - generating trials , we count that as an @xmath57 detection .",
    "due to destructive interference , @xmath56 should not fire for @xmath57 input , so its firing will count as an @xmath39 detection",
    ". then the scheme of appendix a is used to reconcile alice s and bob s trials by classical information exchange in order to arrive at an unambiguously agreed - upon key . during the security checks ,",
    "we then look at the distribution of counts in @xmath55 and @xmath56 separately in order to detect eavesdropper - induced deviations from the expected probability distributions . in order to achieve the indistinguishability required for interference ,",
    "the oam of each photon is shifted to zero after the sorting by a spiral phase plate or by other means .",
    "measurements with detectors @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively , are equivalent to looking for nonzero projections onto the states @xmath58 )    .",
    "superpositions of the form @xmath59 cause constructive interference at the @xmath60 detectors and destructive interference at the @xmath61 detectors , while oam eigenstates lead to equal detection rates at both types . ]",
    "there are then multiple possible output states for alice and bob .",
    "each can measure in the @xmath26 basis and obtain one of the @xmath62 states , or they can measure in the @xmath27 basis and register one of the @xmath63 or @xmath64 states . their joint output probabilities for these states can then be found by taking the incoming state , applying the appropriate projection operator ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) , and then taking the inner product of the resulting projection with the initial state .",
    "the effect of eve s intervention on bob s channel can be dealt with by inserting similar additional projection operators representing eve s measurements .",
    "these extra projection operators tend to spread the probability distributions out , causing them to be nonzero for combinations of outcomes that previously had vanishing probabilities . as a result",

    "columns label alice s measurements , while rows label bob s .",
    "the matrix of outcome probabilities then has the form @xmath92 where explicit expressions for the submatrices @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 may be found in appendix b.    the matrices @xmath93 and @xmath95 represent , respectively , the events on which both alice and bob measured in the @xmath26 basis or both in the @xmath27 basis .",

    "we define the change in the probability matrix due to eavesdropping , @xmath109 the _ disturbance _ @xcite introduced by the eavesdropper can be used as a measure of how much effect she is having on the outcomes of the communication .",

    "for larger alphabets ( more key bits per photon ) , the mutual information shared by alice and bob increases logarithmically with alphabet size , while the amount of classical information that needs to be exchanged stays constant .",

    "furthermore , the amount of revealed information is independent of @xmath9 , while the total information from the quantum exchange increases with increasing alphabet size like @xmath117 ; thus this information leakage becomes more and more negligible with increasing @xmath9 , as compared to the total information .",

    "<S> security against simple eavesdropping attacks is demonstrated for a recently proposed quantum key distribution protocol which uses the fibonacci recursion relation to enable high - capacity key generation with entangled photon pairs . </S>",
    "<S> no transmitted pairs need to be discarded in reconciliation ; the only pairs not used for key generation are those used for security - checking . </S>",
    "<S> although the proposed approach does not allow eavesdropper - induced errors to be detected on single trials , it can nevertheless reveal the eavesdropper s action on the quantum channel by detecting changes in the distribution of outcome probabilities over multiple trials , and can do so as well as the bb84 protocol . </S>",
    "<S> the mutual information shared by the participants is calculated and used to show that a secret key can always be distilled . </S>"
