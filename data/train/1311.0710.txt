    "our objective is to develop a representation theory for classes of algebras which have arisen in the modelling of default logics .",
    "specifically , we consider bilattices which have been used to study logics with prioritised defaults  @xcite ; the simplest and best known of these bilattices was introduced by ginsberg @xcite under the name @xmath0 .",
    "as we indicate below , such ` default bilattices ' do not have the interlacing property and so the equational classes they generate fall outside the scope of the product representation theorem , the cornerstone of the structure theory of interlaced bilattices .",
    "a novel approach is required in order to develop an analogous structure theory beyond the interlaced setting .",
    "this we provide by the application of natural duality theory . in @xcite ,",
    "cabrer and priestley showed that , for the class @xmath1 of distributive bilattices , the product representation can be seen as a consequence of , and very closely allied to , the natural duality for @xmath1 presented there . in the present paper",
    "we consider an infinite sequence of default bilattices , each having its predecessor as a homomorphic image .",
    "we develop natural dualities for the equational classes generated by these bilattices and thereby arrive at a product representation for the members of these classes ( theorem  [ thm : prodrepdefault ] ) .    to set the scene we recall the background very briefly .",
    "the motivation for ginsberg s pioneering paper  @xcite was his plan to use bilattices as a framework for inference with applications to artificial intelligence and logic programming , in particular for modelling inference in situations where information is incomplete or contradictory .",
    "the central idea was to consider sets which carry two lattice orders : @xmath2 , interpreted as measuring ` degree of truth ' , and @xmath3 , measuring ` degree of knowledge ' .",
    "certain elements of such structures were then treated as distinguished constants , representing degrees of truth or knowledge , @xmath4 ( ` true ' ) , @xmath5 ( ` false by default ' ) , and so on ; @xmath6 and @xmath7 are used to denote , respectively , ` contradiction ' and ` no information ' .",
    "[ fig : four+seven](ii ) shows the bilattice @xmath0 ginsberg proposed to model this scenario . as is customary in the bilattices literature the two constituent lattices are combined into a single diagram , with knowledge measured vertically and truth horizontally .",
    "the bilattice @xmath0 may be seen as providing a more refined model of truth and falsity than the best - known bilattice of all , commonly known as @xmath8 and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : four+seven](i ) . in @xmath8 ,",

    "but there are situations in which a hierarchy of degrees of default may be appropriate .",
    "bilattices which model prioritised defaults were discussed by ginsberg  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 7.3.3 ) and there is now a range of applications of such structures in artificial intelligence .",
    "we note for example the design by encheva and tumin  @xcite of a tutoring feedback system based on a ten - element default bilattice to inform follow - up questions when the initial responses are incomplete or inconsistent .",
    "the same ten - element bilattice is employed by sakama  @xcite .",
    "prioritised default bilattices have also been applied to visual surveillance by shet , harwood and davis  @xcite . in section  [ sec : classkn ] we introduce an infinite sequence of bilattices @xmath12 , as a means of modelling prioritised defaults . here",

    "[ fig : kn - t - order ] depicts the knowledge and truth orders of @xmath12 , for general  @xmath16 .",
    "there is a critical difference between @xmath8 and @xmath0 . in @xmath8 ,",
    "each of the four lattice operations distributes over each of the other three ; in @xmath0 ( and also in the refinements we consider ) this fails .",
    "a bilattice with lattice operations @xmath17 ( with associated order @xmath3 ) and @xmath18 ( with associated order @xmath2 ) is _ interlaced _ if each pair of lattice operations is monotonic with respect to the other order .",
    "this holds in @xmath8 .",
    "but in @xmath0 it fails , as is witnessed by the fact that @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the significance of the interlacing condition is that it is sufficient , and also necessary , for the product representation theorem to be valid : any interlaced bilattice has as its underlying set a product @xmath21 of a lattice  @xmath22 with itself ; the lattice operations on the factors determine the bilattice operations ; negation sends a pair @xmath23 to @xmath24 . for an account of the theorem and its complicated history , see the recent note by davey  @xcite .",
    "this note gives a comprehensive list of references both to the theorem itself and to the way in which it is used to study interlaced bilattices .",
    "we conclude this introduction by summarising the content and structure of the paper and highlighting our principal results .",
    "we focus on mathematical aspects of default bilattices , rather than logical aspects .",
    "we shall consider @xmath12 as an algebra of a specified type and investigate the variety @xmath25 generated by @xmath12 , for an arbitrary value of  @xmath16 . in section  [ sec : classkn ] we derive the properties of the algebras @xmath12 on which our representation theory will rely .    our primary tool , as in @xcite",
    ", will be the theory of natural dualities , for which the text by clark and davey @xcite serves as the background reference .",
    "here we need the multisorted version of the theory , as it applies to a restricted class of finitely generated lattice - based varieties .",
    "section  [ sec : multisorted ] outlines , as far as possible in black - box style , rudiments of this theory .",
    "the framework was first developed more than  25 years ago , but examples of its exploitation are quite scarce .",
    "theorem  [ thm : dualityvarietykn ] describes our duality for  @xmath26 , an instructive new example of the multisorted machinery at work .",
    "it also provides us with a springboard to our later results .    in theorem  [ thm : chardualvn ]",
    "we describe the objects in the category dual to  @xmath26 : these multisorted topological structures are such that each sort naturally carries the structure of a priestley space , and there is a sequence of maps which links each sort to the next . in section  [ sec :",
    "prodrep ] , we derive our product representation theorem ( theorem  [ thm : prodrepdefault ] ) .",
    "the proof makes explicit use of the multisorted structure dual to a given algebra in @xmath26 to show how the algebra can be obtained from a product built from a finite sequence of distributive lattices with linking homomorphisms .",
    "section  [ sec : prodrep ] can if desired be studied independently of section  [ sec : reveng ] . in the latter we connect directly with priestley duality , relating the natural dual space of an algebra in @xmath26 to the priestley dual of its ( necessarily distributive ) knowledge lattice reduct .",
    "the paper concludes with a short section devoted to the quasivarieties @xmath27 .",
    "here we can employ duality theory in its single - sorted form .",
    "the term ` bilattice ' is not used in a consistent way throughout the extensive bilattice literature .",
    "however nowadays it usually refers to a structure which , besides its two lattice structures and , possibly , constants , carries also a negation operation , and we follow this usage .",
    "henceforth a _ bilattice _",
    "@xmath28 will be an algebraic structure @xmath29 such that the reducts @xmath30 and @xmath31 are lattices and @xmath32 is a unary operation which preserves the @xmath33-order , reverses the @xmath34-order , and is involutive .",
    "we denote by @xmath3 the order associated with @xmath35 and @xmath2 the order associated with @xmath31 .",
    "we shall consider only bilattices in which both of the lattice orders are bounded .",
    "the bounds of the knowledge lattice are denoted by @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and those of the truth lattice by @xmath4 and @xmath9 .    in an @xmath16-level prioritised default bilattice ,",
    "the designated default truth values form two finite sequences @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 will be lower in the knowledge order than their respective predecessor default truth values @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the connotation is thus that knowledge represented by the truth values at level @xmath42 has lower priority than that from those at level  @xmath43 .",
    "in addition , one thinks of @xmath39 as being ` less true ' than its predecessor @xmath44 , while @xmath38 is ` less false ' than @xmath45 .",

    "the idea of levels of default seems very distant .",
    "interestingly , we shall see shortly that condition  ( 2 ) emerges in a natural way in the context of reasoning with defaults and helps to motivate the construction underlying our product representation .",

    "thus we obtain a bilattice structure @xmath820 whose universe is @xmath821 .",
    "it is natural to consider evidence being accumulated in an iterative fashion , with pre - existing evidence taken into account by default , and to be seen as having priority .",
    "such earlier evidence , encoded by a lattice @xmath822 , might have come from statistics , previous trials , or from other sources .",
