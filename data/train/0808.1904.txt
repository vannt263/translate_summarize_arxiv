    "it is now widely believed that about 25% of the energy density in the universe is in the form of a cold dark matter .",
    "the nature of the elementary particle which constitutes this dark component is however not known .",
    "the scenario with an unstable gravitino which is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) with a very long life time as a dark matter is particularly attractive  @xcite , having interesting consequences for astrophysics and cosmology , as well as colliders .",
    "the lsp gravitino in an r - parity conserving supersymmetric ( susy ) theory is absolutely stable and could be a dark matter candidate  @xcite .",
    "an unstable gravitino , in a theory with broken r - parity symmetry , needs to be sufficiently long lived to be a dark matter .",
    "the strengths of the r - parity violating ( rpv ) couplings ( usually denoted by @xmath1 ) needed to achive required longevity must be highly suppressed i.e. @xmath2 , and one would then like to understand the origin of such small couplings .",
    "it is therefore interesting to explore models where such small couplings may arise naturally .",
    "we find that tev scale supersymmetric left - right ( susylr ) models which have been discussed in connection with neutrino masses and strong cp problems provides one such framework , with two interesting features : ( a ) r - parity breaking is dynamically induced in the global minimum of the potential in order for the theory to break parity ; ( b ) smallness of neutrino masses guarantees that the resulting r - parity violating interactions are highly suppressed .",
    "the left - right symmetric theories based on the gauge group @xmath3@xcite were originally introduced to explain parity violation in the standard model and were found to have a number of interesting properties .",
    "these models provide a natural framework for understanding the small neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism@xcite and became specially interesting after the discovery of neutrino masses .",
    "the right handed neutrino which is essential for seesaw mechanism is automatically contained and furthermore the b - l gauge symmetry@xcite whose breaking provides the heavy majorana mass to the right handed neutrinos relates the small neutrino masses to the parity breaking scale .",
    "this implementation of the seesaw mechanism is different from those in the sm context where the right handed neutrino mass is a free parameter .",
    "the seesaw scale ( or the parity breaking scale ) however , still remains undetermined .",
    "it can take values anywhere from near a tev if the dirac yukawa couplings @xmath4 or it can be much higher if the @xmath5 s are larger .",
    "it is important to note that a tev seesaw scale is perfectly natural and does not require any higher fine tuning than that present in sm .",
    "a tev seesaw scale is clearly of great interest for the lhc .",
    "it is worth noting that the current searches by the cdf and d0 collaborations have yielded limits on the parity breaking scale in the 750 gev range  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the minimal left - right ( susylr ) extension of the mssm since it combines the advantages of supersymmetry while making mssm realistic by providing a way to understand neutrino masses .",
    "it also cures certain problems of the mssm such as making r - parity a good symmetry if one uses b - l=2 higgs triplets to break parity so that proton is stable .",
    "furthermore , it provides a solution to the susy and strong cp problems . the minimal version of this model ( without any gauge singlets )",
    "has two striking features : ( i ) the parity and susy breaking scales are related , thereby predicting that the seesaw scale is necessarily in the tev range and ( ii ) while r - parity conservation is automatic above the parity breaking scale , the ground state of the theory can break parity only if r - parity is spontaneously broken by a vaccum expectation value ( vev ) of the right - handed sneutrino fields  @xcite .",
    "thus the model breaks r - parity dynamically . furthermore in this case",
    "there is an upper limit on the @xmath6 scale in the range of a few tev s  @xcite , which is to be expected since parity breaking and susy breaking are intimately linked .",
    "this makes it possible to test the theory using lhc data expected in coming years .",
    "an interesting feature of the resulting dynamical r - parity breaking is that it only breaks lepton number and keeps baryon number intact and therefore the proton is absolutely stable in this model .",
    "it is also worth noting that while the effective r - parity breaking below the @xmath6 scale has some properties similar to mssm with bilinear r - parity breaking  @xcite , it has many properties which are characteristic of the susylr theory that can provide distinguishing tests .",
    "the immediate question that then arises is whether this susy model which starts out promising a stable dark matter , does indeed have a dark matter after parity and r - parity breaking .",
    "we address this question in this paper . we find that despite r - parity breaking , the unstable lsp gravitino in our model can be the dark matter of the universe  @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is that requiring sub - ev neutrino masses suppresses the strengths of the r - parity breaking interactions responsible for gravitino decay to such a level that the gravitino becomes sufficiently long lived and dark matter .",
    "secondly , we also find that despite the neutrino - higgsino mixing induced by spontaneous r - parity breaking , the seesaw results for neutrino masses remain essentially intact .",
    "another consequence of this small strength of r - parity breaking is that the next - to - lightest susy particle ( nlsp ) which can be a neutralino or stau or sneutrino produced at lhc has a lifetime such that it can give rise to displaced vertices in the lhc detector  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii presents the basic contents of the model , and reviews the result of ref .",
    "@xcite that r - parity indeed must break in the model if ordinary parity has to break . in section iii",
    ", we consider implications of rpv on the neutrino mass in this model . in section iv , we discuss contribution to various rpv couplings due to bilinear terms in the superpotential . in section",
    "v , we derive cosmological implications for gravitino as the dark matter .",
    "in section vi , we discuss collider signatures of the model and in section vii , we briefly discuss some other consequences of the model . in the appendix",
    ", we display the minimization of the potential and obtain bounds on the @xmath6-boson mass and the right - handed sneutrino vev .",
    "the gauge group in the minimal susylr model is @xmath7 .",
    "the chiral left and right handed quark superfields are @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively , and similarly the lepton superfields are given by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where flavor indices have been implicit .",
    "the symmetry breaking is achieved by the following bi - fundamental and @xmath12 triplet higgs superfields : @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "the superpotential of the model is : @xmath19 where @xmath20 s are yukawa couplings , @xmath21 is the majorana coupling and @xmath22 is the @xmath23-term for triplets .",
    "note that we do not have any gauge singlet fields in the model .",
    "first point to note is that if @xmath24 , the susy breaking scale , the right handed gauge symmetry remains unbroken since we must have @xmath25 to preserve supersymmetry . from this",
    "it follows that these vevs i.e. @xmath26 and @xmath27 and @xmath23-term must have tev scale vevs , i.e. , the theory is necessarily one with tev scale parity breaking .",
    "from now on we will assume that all the mass parameters in the theory are of order of a tev .    to do a detailed analysis of the ground state of the theory",
    ", we write down the scalar potential including the soft susy - breaking terms : @xmath28 we first give @xmath29 : @xmath30 below we give some of the terms from @xmath31 , with @xmath32 going over all the fields in the model and the soft susy breaking term @xmath33 @xcite which are relevant for our discussion : @xmath34 \\nonumber \\\\   & + &   m^2_{ab } { \\rm tr}\\left (   \\phi_a^\\dag \\phi_b   \\right ) + m_0 ^ 2(\\tilde l^\\dagger \\tilde l +   \\tilde l^{c\\dagger } \\tilde l^c ) \\nonumber \\\\   & + & m_\\delta^2 { \\rm tr } \\left ( \\delta^\\dag \\delta + \\delta^{c\\dag }   \\delta^c \\right ) + m^2_{\\bar \\delta } { \\rm tr } \\left ( \\bar \\delta^\\dag   \\bar",
    "\\delta + \\bar \\delta^{c\\dag } \\bar \\delta^c \\right ) \\ , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in addition to the terms dependent on higgs fields , we have also kept slepton terms since sneutrino is electrically neutral and can in principle have vev .",
    "we have omitted all terms involving the squarks .",
    "all soft parameters with mass dimensions are assumed to have tev susy - breaking scale .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that if the ground state of this tree level potential has to break parity , it must break r - parity by giving a vev to the @xmath35 field .",
    "we review this argument in the appendix .",
    "the global minimum of the model is then characterized by the following vev pattern of the fields @xmath36 in this case , there is an upper bound on the @xmath37 scale as discussed in @xcite , given roughly by @xmath38 where the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 are susy breaking parameters in the theory , of the order of a few hundred gevs and @xmath21 is a typical majorana coupling of the @xmath41 fields . using these",
    ", we get few tev upper limit on the right - handed scale if @xmath42 . a detailed derivation of the upper bound",
    "is given in the appendix .",
    "it has recently been shown that in the case of the model with an additional singlet , once one takes one loop corrections into account , in the domain of parameters where @xmath43 , r - parity conserving and electric charge conserving minimum indeed becomes the global minimum@xcite . in this case one",
    "generically needs a higher parity breaking scale to get correct mass spectrum for sleptons .",
    "our discussions in the subsequent sections will remain valid for the complementary domain i.e. @xmath44 in the presence of loop effects .",
    "r - parity conserving ground state can also be a global minimum if one includes higher dimensional operators provided the parity breaking scale is above @xmath45 gev@xcite . since we are interested in tev scale @xmath6 , these new operators do not affect our considerations .    in the rest of the paper",
    ", we will assume that the component of the right handed sneutrinos that acquires a vev must align along the electron flavor direction so that the neutrino masses will remain in the sub - ev range .",
    "it appears that it may be possible to ensure this by choosing the @xmath46 term associated with @xmath47 coupling to be sufficiently negative while keeping this for other flavors to be positive .",
    "we do not pursue the details of this calculation here .",
    "in this section , we address the question of how to understand small neutrino masses in this model .",
    "as is well known , neutrinos acquire dirac masses after electroweak symmetry is broken by the @xmath48 vevs .",
    "we assume that only @xmath49 and @xmath50 fields acquire vevs @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively . in this model ,",
    "b - l breaking gives large majorana masses to the right handed neutrinos which combined with the the dirac masses leads to the usual type i seesaw mechanism . in the absence of the sneutrino vev , the type i seesaw mechanism yields sub - ev left - handed neutrino masses from tev - scale right handed - neutrino masses provided the neutrino dirac yukawa couplings @xmath5 are of the same order as that of the electron in the standard model .",
    "an upper bound on the @xmath37 scale dicted by the dynamics of the model , implies that all elements of the neutrino yukawa coupling matrix in our model must have an upper bound of order @xmath53 .",
    "there are no type ii contributions in the renormalizable supersymmetric left - right model in the supersymmetric limit .",
    "after susy breaking , a finite but small type ii contribution is induced which can be comparable to the type i contribution . this does not affect the analysis of neutrino masses done below and we ignore it here . as we show later , the small dirac yukawa couplings needed for understanding small neutrino masses have the important implication , that the gravitino lifetime which is inversely proportional to @xmath54 is long enough that it can become the dark matter of the universe .",
    "the presence of right handed sneutrino condensate complicates the analysis of neutrino masses since it introduces a mixing term of the form @xmath55 in the superpotential making the neutrino - higgsino - gaugino mass matrix to be a @xmath56 mass matrix .",
    "as we show below , if we assume that the right handed sneutrino that acquires a vev is aligned along the electron flavor direction , one can still use successive seesaw approximation so that neutrino masses remain in the sub - ev range as in the simple type i seesaw models prior to neutrino higgsino mixing .    to proceed with the neutrino masses ,",
    "note that the terms in the superpotential are induced by the sneutrino vev and expand the seesaw matrix are given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 s are defined through @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "these terms mix lepton superfields with the higgs superfields and therefore break r - parity .",
    "they lead to the mixing of lefthanded neutrinos with the neutralinos .",
    "these mixing terms enlarge the @xmath62 normal seesaw neutrino mass matrix to @xmath56 .",
    "however , we can employ successive decoupling to simplify the analysis of this matrix to get neutrino masses . for @xmath37 in the multi - tev range ,",
    "the @xmath37-scale fermions decouple first , leaving a @xmath63 mass matrix . on the further application of a second stage seesaw through integrating out the electroweak scale fields , small neutrino masses follow . for convenience of discussion ,",
    "we choose a basis in which the @xmath64 is diagonal and all neutrino mixings arise from @xmath5 .",
    "we will also choose all majorana couplings of right handed neutrinos , @xmath21 , to be diagonal .    as noted before we will assume the rh - sneutrino vev to align along the electron flavor i.e. @xmath65 so that the neutrino - higgsino mixing is in the mev range .",
    "the symmetric neutrino - neutralino mass matrix can now be written in the basis of @xmath66 as @xmath67 where we have assumed the vev s of doublet fields have the following pattern @xmath68 to simplify this matrix to obtain the neutrino masses , we proceed in two steps as mentioned : first we integrate out the tev scale fields @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and a combination of @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",

    "note that in the context of mssm with r - parity breaking bilinear terms , getting small neutrino masses generically requires to fine - tune the neutrino - higgsino coupling terms  @xcite . in our case , the smallness of these terms is now guaranteed by the smallness of the dirac yukawa couplings together with the alignment of @xmath92 along the electron direction .",
    "our model is different from all previous models of r - parity breaking @xcite because r - parity breaking is forced by the tree level dynamics of the theory to enable parity breaking  @xcite : we do not have the freedom of choosing the tree level parameters leading to an alternative vacuum with r - parity conservation . here",
    "r - parity is broken by the right - handed sneutrino vev which leads to bilinear r - parity violating coupling at low energies . as noted recently , in models with singlets , once one loop corrections are included@xcite , in a parameter subdomain",
    ", one can indeed have an r - parity conserving vacuum as a global minimum without breaking electric charge .",
    "if the same discussion were to apply to the minimal case under discussion here , the considerations of this paper will still remain valid in the complementary parameter domain .    the dominant r - parity violating interaction in the effective theory below the tev scale , after the right - handed sneutrino and the heavy @xmath41 fields are integrated out , is given by @xmath93 there are analogous terms coming from the soft - breaking trilinear terms given by @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the terms in the second equation above arise when we implement the soft susy breaking on the effective r - parity breaking lagrangian ( say via usual msugra ) .",
    "since in general the coefficients are arbitrary and we ignore then in what follows .    in order to understand neutrino masses , we have assumed that only the right - handed electron sneutrino gets a vev .",
    "the main consequence of this is that since @xmath97 and @xmath98 , the strengths of rpv interactions are all very small . in the presence of these terms ,",
    "the gravitino is unstable ; however , we will see later that the small magnitude of these coupling strengths required to understand neutrino masses , allows the gravitino to live long enough to be the dark matter of the universe .",
    "thus the gravitino dark matter is connected to the smallness of the neutrino mass , and the viability of the scenario does not require tuning of a separate parameter .             the bilinear r - parity breaking terms in the superpotential lead to mixings between neutralinos , @xmath99 and neutrinos @xmath100 as discussed in the previous section and similarly between charginos and charged leptons .",
    "these terms can also generate mixing between sleptons and @xmath101 boson through the f - term of @xmath58 and @xmath102 @xmath103 to calculate r - parity violating decays , a general way is to diagonalize all the mass matrices and then to rotate all fields into physical states . in the present work ,",
    "since we only estimate the order of magnitude for the r - parity violating effects , we adopt an approximate but more convenient approach .",
    "we take the bilinear rpv terms as mass perturbations which are to be inserted into all the amplitudes .",
    "it is these mass insertions that act as sources of r - parity violation . in fig .  1",
    ", we illustrate how to get the  flavor - violating \" gauge coupling induced by bilinear rpv term  @xcite , which plays an important role in neutralino decay .",

    "( [ mixing ] ) , and that on the right is generated through slepton - higgs mixing due to eq .",
    "( [ mixing2 ] ) .",
    "as expected , the right - handed ( s)leptons can be coupled to leptons , whereas the left - handed ( s)leptons couple to both hadrons and leptons .",
    "in generic sugra theories , the gravitino is a very weakly coupled particle with mass ranging from ev to many tev s .",
    "it can be produced in early universe plasma and remains in equilibrium with rest of the cosmic soup at very high twemperatures i.e. @xmath106 .",
    "slightly once the universe cools below the planck temperature , the gravitinos decouple .",
    "since their annihilation or decay rate are very slow , their number density dilutes only due to entropy dumped into the cosmic bath at different annihilation thresholds of other particles .",
    "this dilution is not a large effect .",
    "therefore in the absence of inflation , if gravitino is the lsp and r - parity is conserved , its mass must not to exceed 1 kev in order not to over - close the universe .",
    "in the inflationary scenario however , any initial gravitino abundance will be diluted to very tiny values",
    ". however , secondary production of gravitinos in the reheating process can be appreciable and proportional to the reheat temperature .",

    "in this appendix , we discuss the minimization of the higgs potential to obtain an upper bound on the right - handed scale @xmath37 .",
    "first we will show that in the susylr model , if r - parity is preserved by the vacuum , parity symmetry can not be broken i.e. @xmath189 as shown in @xcite .",
    "a more precise statement perhaps is that , if we express the potential , @xmath190 as functions of the vevs of the neutral higgs fields ( @xmath191 and @xmath192 and look for a minimum of @xmath190 along the direction @xmath193 ( i.e. r - parity conserving ) , the minimum occurs at @xmath189 .",
    "we then show that once we include r - parity breaking effect by the vacuum i.e. @xmath194 i.e. along the direction @xmath195 , there appear global minima that break parity i.e. @xmath196 and also that it occurs only below a certain value for @xmath37 and @xmath197 i.e. there is an upper limit on the parity breaking scale .",
    "this proves our assertion that r - parity breaking in this theory is a dynamical phenomenon .    to show this",
    "let us start with the potential in eq .",
    "( 2 ) which consists of the field vevs @xmath37 and @xmath198 and @xmath199 and look for its minimum : @xmath200 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left [ f^2 x^4 -(2av_r+2f\\mu_\\delta \\bar{v}_r- m^2_0   - 4 f^2 v^2_r ) x^2 \\right ] + \\left [ \\frac{g_r^2 + g^{2}_{bl}}{8 } \\left ( x^2 - 2 v_r^2 + 2 \\bar v_r^2 \\right)^2 \\right ] \\ , \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have set the @xmath201 and @xmath202 vevs to zero . note that we have kept the @xmath203 in the potential . for simplicity ,",
    "we have set @xmath204 .",
    "the first point to note is that to ensure a lower bound on the potential , we must satisfy the conditions on the parameters : @xmath205 the first constraint comes from looking at the direction @xmath206 and @xmath193 demanding that the potential is bounded from below .",
    "the second comes from looking along the qed breaking vacuum so that the d - terms vanish and setting @xmath193 and again demanding positivity .",
    "once these two conditions are imposed , for @xmath193 , the minimum of the potential corresponds to @xmath207 and hence no parity violation .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the form of the potential for @xmath193 is same as in the case of mssm , where of course we know that symmetry breaking occurs .",
    "the difference in the case of susylr is the observation@xcite that there exist qed breaking directions along which for arbitrary @xmath37 and @xmath197 , the d - term vanishes so that one has the second condition in eq .",
    "( [ condition ] ) . in the case of mssm",
    ", the second condition does not exist and in fact to break the gauge symmetry in susylr case , one needs the opposite of the second condition i.e. @xmath208 .    in order to show that along the nonzero @xmath192 directions",
    ", one can indeed have a minimum that breaks the gauge symmetry , it is convenient to rewrite the potential in eq .",
    "( [ av ] ) as follows : @xmath209 ^ 2+d(v_r , \\bar{v}_r ) \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath210-\\left(f^2+\\frac{\\tilde{g}^2}{8}\\right)c^2 \\ , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "c~&=&~\\frac{\\left[2av_r+2f\\mu_\\delta \\bar{v}_r- m^2_0   - 4 f^2 v^2_r+\\frac{1}{2}\\tilde{g}^2(v^2_r-\\bar{v}^2_r)\\right]}{2(f^2 + \\frac{\\tilde{g}^2}{8 } ) } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we define @xmath211 . advantage of rewriting this way is that we can now minimize with respect to @xmath192 very easily and get @xmath212 since @xmath192 is a real number , the above equation implies that @xmath213 . for @xmath37 and @xmath197 close to each other",
    ", the @xmath213 condition turns into an upper limit on the @xmath37 scale of @xmath214 this is clear from the expression for @xmath215 since for large @xmath37 , the @xmath216 term in @xmath215 dominates making @xmath217 and hence driving the vev of @xmath192 to zero in which case , the minimum corresponds to @xmath218 as noted and hence no parity violation .",
    "this is in accord with the observation of ref.@xcite that the tree level potential for the minimal susylr model requires r - parity violation if parity has to break , as required to get the standard model and the parity breaking scale has an upper limit in the tev range , making the theory experimentally testable at lhc .",
    "we have done a numerical analysis of the potential and find that the full potential indeed has a negative minimum value only when the @xmath219 and @xmath220 and @xmath221 giving the desired parity violating graound state .",
    "we also find from this numerical analysis that once we set @xmath222 or equivalently @xmath223 , the ground state corresponds to @xmath224 . in the table",
    "below , we give some numerical examples of solutions for the desired vacua for specific tev scale parameters in the potential for the case when @xmath219 .",
    "we check that the potential has a minimum for each case with a value of the potential at the minimum which is negative so that it is indeed a global minimum .",
    "incidentally , along the @xmath193 direction in the potential , there is also no electrweak symmetry breaking by similar arguments as above @xcite i.e. @xmath229 ; however along the above @xmath219 direction , one immediately gets @xmath230 also along with breaking of @xmath231 symmetry .",
