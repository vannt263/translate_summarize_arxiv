    "a comprehensive knowledge about the mass spectrum and spin splittings of heavy baryons is important for our understanding of quantum chromodynamics .",
    "however , except for singly heavy charmed baryons and only one singly heavy bottom baryon ( @xmath0 ) , most of the heavy baryon masses have not yet been measured experimentally @xcite . on the theoretical side",
    "there are many results on heavy baryon masses from different models including , for example , a number of quark model variations@xcite .    using lattice qcd , substantial",
    "work has been done in the heavy meson sector .",
    "however , so far only very few results have been reported for heavy baryons@xcite , and there is only one work @xcite where heavy ( bottom ) quarks are treated nonrelativistically .",
    "a further study of charmed and bottom heavy baryons on the lattice using nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) therefore seems worthwhile .",
    "extraction of the experimentally observed mass splittings between vector and pseudoscalar mesons remains a challenging problem in lattice qcd ; quenched calculations have so far been unable to extract the observed mass splittings@xcite , and unquenched studies have not resolved the issue@xcite .",
    "therefore , it is natural to ask whether lattice results for baryon mass splittings also exhibit similar suppression compared to experiment .    empirically , spin splittings in baryons are smaller than those in the meson sector .",
    "moreover , in a lattice simulation the correlators for baryons , particularly for spin 3/2 states , are noisier than those for mesons , and thus , by using lattice qcd it is comparatively difficult to extract a reliable mass spectrum for heavy baryons . in this work we report on the charmed and bottom baryon mass spectrum and mass splittings by using a nonrelativistic heavy quark action and an improved light quark action on anisotropic lattices .    in section ii we summarize different charmed and bottom heavy baryons with their relevant quantum numbers and discuss our choice for interpolating fields .",
    "section iii presents numerical simulation details . for heavy quarks",
    ", we use the nonrelativistic action from ref .",
    "@xcite , while a tadpole improved gauge action and an improved dirac - wilson action of the d234 type @xcite are used for light quarks .",
    "since these actions were previously detailed elsewhere @xcite , we will describe them only in an appendix .",
    "the calculations are done on two different anisotropic lattices with the same gauge configurations as were used in ref .",
    "@xcite at @xmath1 and @xmath2 .    in section",
    "iv we present our results .",
    "masses are calculated using two methods ; the first uses the standard nrqcd relation between mass and energy while the second employs mass splittings to calculate masses .",
    "as mass splittings can be estimated more accurately than masses , errors in the second method are smaller than those obtained from the first one .",
    "the overall systematic uncertainty is estimated by including scale uncertainty , uncertainty due to the choice of a time window for fitting correlation functions , error due to extrapolation to the physical light quark masses , uncertainty in fixing charm and bottom masses and uncertainty from our determination of the lattice anisotropy .",
    "spin splittings are discussed in section v. from our results , along with other published results , we conclude that the suppression of mass splittings is _ not present _ in the baryon sector in the same way as it is in the meson sector . over the whole mass range where data are available , quenched lattice qcd simulations yield mass differences between spin 3/2 and spin 1/2 baryons which are comparable to or larger than experimental values .",
    "singly and doubly charmed and bottom baryons are summarized in tables i and ii respectively .",
    "table ii also includes doubly heavy states containing two different heavy quarks ( charmed and bottom quarks together ) .",
    "quark content , as well as the spin - parity @xmath3 , the isospin @xmath4 , and @xmath5 which identifies the total spin of the light quarks ( also spin - flavor symmetry : @xmath6 is symmetric while @xmath7 is antisymmetric ) are shown .",
    "notice that masses for many singly heavy states are not measured yet and there are no data at all on masses for doubly heavy states .",

    "10 ) can be calculated more precisely than masses ( eq .  9 ) .",
    "therefore , for example , one can calculate a meson mass from the relation @xmath10 where @xmath11 here @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the heaviest light quark and a lighter one respectively , and @xmath14 is extracted by using eq .",
    "( 13 ) is valid as long as @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( 11 ) is the same _ i.e. , _ both states consist of the same heavy quark @xmath16 .",
    "similarly , masses of singly and doubly heavy baryons can be extracted from meson masses by using @xmath17 where @xmath18 for example , the @xmath19 mass is extracted by taking its difference ( at each @xmath20 ) with the @xmath21 mass ( @xmath22 ) at @xmath23 and then subtracting that from @xmath22 .",

    "results are summarized in table v , where the first error is the statistical error obtained from a bootstrap analysis with a bootstrap sample size equal to the configuration sample size .",
    "the second error is an overall systematic error due to scale and anisotropy uncertainties , the uncertainty due to choosing a time window , the light quark extrapolation error and the strange quark mass uncertainty .",
    "mesons , singly heavy baryons and doubly heavy baryons are separated into different groups by horizontal lines . in table",
    "vi we have compared our results with those obtained by using a relativistic ( d234 ) heavy quark action @xcite and experimental numbers ( where available ) .",
    "one can notice that the nrqcd results and d234 results are consistent with each other .",
    "results are also consistent with a previous nrqcd calculation @xcite . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is found that the suppression of spin splittings is not present in the baryon sector , although such a suppression is known to be characteristic of the heavy meson sector .",
    "one can also notice that the spin splittings for doubly heavy baryons are as large as their singly heavy counterparts .",
    "in order to put the results of the present calculation into perspective it is useful to consider spin splittings over the whole range of available quark masses . we start with mesons where it has been known for a long time that the squared mass difference @xmath26 for vector and pseudoscalar mesons is approximately constant for all mesons of the form @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is up or down and @xmath29 is any light or heavy flavor .",

    "the results for the baryon pairs @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are shown in fig .",
    "5 . it is a remarkable empirical fact that the baryon spin splitting scales almost exactly like the inverse of the average meson mass .",
    "the implication is that the ratio of meson to baryon spin splittings is almost constant .",
    "this was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and was to some extent anticipated by lipkin @xcite from the point of view of the quark model ( see also lipkin and odonnell @xcite ) .",
    "the results of quenched lattice calculations are also shown in fig .",
    "the suppression of spin splittings relative to experiment , visible for mesons , is not seen for baryons .",
    "the results of the present lattice nrqcd calculation support this conclusion in the charm and bottom sectors .",
    "it is clear that a definitive measurement of @xmath39 and @xmath40 masses would be highly desirable to extend the experimental comparison to larger mass values .",
    "from the point of view of lattice nrqcd our results present an interesting challenge .",
    "as is well known , the spin splittings of both charmonium @xcite and heavy - light mesons @xcite are clearly underestimated by lattice nrqcd simulations . up to now",
    ", these simulations have used couplings modified only by mean - field tadpole factors .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that there are additional large perturbative corrections to these couplings .",
    "in particular it might seem that a correction to the quark coupling with the chromomagnetic field ( the @xmath41-term in eq .",
    "( a5 ) ) has the potential to cure the spin splitting deficiency for both charmonium and heavy - light mesons .",
    "however one has to be cautious in wishing for such a cure as it would upset the already reasonable values for spin splittings in the baryon sector .    to summarize , we have calculated the masses of baryons containing one or two heavy quarks using quenched lattice qcd .",
    "nrqcd is used to describe charm and bottom quarks . in the charm sector",
    "the results of this work are compatible with those obtained previously where a dirac - wilson action of the d234 type was used for the heavy quark .",
    "no suppression of the spin splittings observed in lattice nrqcd simulations of heavy - light mesons is seen in the heavy baryon sector .",
    "this and our previous work @xcite leave a number of difficult open questions .",
    "one would like to be able to improve the lattice calculations of baryons to reduce the uncertainties to the same level achievable in mesons .",
    "also how ( and whether ) the addition of dynamical quarks to the simulations will solve the dilemma of spin splittings has yet to be understood .",
    "a phenomenological issue is to understand the remarkable constancy in the meson to baryon spin splitting ratio over the whole available quark mass range . on the experimental side",
    "it will be a significant challenge to extend baryon mass measurements in the bottom and doubly heavy sectors .",
