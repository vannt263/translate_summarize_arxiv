    "holography , based on ads / cft ( anti - de - sitter space / conformal field theory ) correspondence  @xcite , has been extensively used to analyze strongly coupled gauge systems .",
    "for instance , qcd can be reformulated based on the gauge - gravity duality , either in the bottom - up approach  @xcite modeled as a five - dimensional gauge theory defined in an ads background , or in the top - down approach  @xcite starting with a stringy setting",
    ". such models of holographic qcd have succeeded well in reproducing several important properties for qcd hadrons within a theoretically expected size of uncertainties . in particular , the bottom - up approach can be made to reproduce the qcd in the all energy region , from the high energy behavior through the operator product expansion ( ope ) down to the low energy resonance physics : the correct power behaviors in ope for the chiral condensate and the gluon condensate are realized by introduction of the bulk ( chiral non - singlet ) scalar field , @xmath1 , corresponding to the @xmath2 operator and ( chiral singlet ) bulk gluonic field , @xmath3 , respectively  @xcite , which is contrasted to the top - down approach having high energy behavior completely different than that of qcd .",
    "the bottom - up holography so constructed can provide us with novel insights into the strong dynamics through the highly nontrivial effects of the gluonic dynamics : it reproduces nicely the known value of the gluon condensate which is otherwise zero , and the mass of @xmath4 meson of the right magnitude .",
    "such a bottom - up holographic qcd model having gluon condensation effects ( hereafter , we will use the phrase  gluonic effects \" to refer to the gluon condensation effects ) @xmath3 was further applied  @xcite to the walking technicolor ( wtc ) model  @xcite which has an approximate scale symmetry and a large anomalous dimension @xmath5 , and further predicts a light composite higgs dubbed `` technidilaton ( td ) '' as a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson of the approximate scale symmetry .",
    "the holographic wtc of ref .",
    "@xcite was formulated through a simple replacement of @xmath6 for qcd by @xmath5 in the mass parameter of the bulk scalar @xmath1 in the holographic qcd with @xmath3 , which was found  @xcite to have more intriguing gluonic effects than in those of the holographic qcd : large gluonic effects due to @xmath3 in wtc actually realize an idealized limit where td  @xcite as a flavor - singlet scalar fermionic bound state ( lowest kaluza - klein ( kk ) mode of @xmath1 ) has no direct relevance to the electroweak symmetry breaking , since the technigluons carry no electroweak charge , and hence can not be identified with the td , or composite higgs , whose constituents must carry the electroweak charge . ]",
    "has a vanishingly small mass compared with the typical symmetry breaking scale @xmath7 ( @xmath8 : techni - pion decay constant ) , and hence it can naturally be as light as 125 gev to be identified as the higgs boson discovered at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the earlier nonperturbative studies based on the ladder approximation  @xcite without nonperturbative gluonic dynamics , which yields a substantially smaller scalar mass than in the qcd case , though it does not have such an idealized massless limit and hence no natural framework for the light td   and the decay constant @xmath9 of the td @xmath10 only in the form of a product , @xmath11 , ( not separately ) .",
    "this implies that a massless td limit @xmath12 is formally realized only when @xmath13 , or the coupling vanishes ( decoupled dilaton )  @xcite . nevertheless , it so happened that the mass estimated by the ladder pcdc actually can be parametrically tuned to be 125 gev in such a way as to be consistent with the current lhc data , being still far from the decoupling limit  @xcite . ] .",
    "therefore , proper inclusion of gluonic effects is important not only for the study of qcd , but also , or more significantly , for the realistic wtc calculations .",
    "holographic computations are generically done through evaluating green functions constructed from ( techni-)quark and gluon currents , so that the main outputs are made from the current correlators , including full information on masses and couplings for the associated mesons and glueball coupled to those currents .",
    "once the vector current correlator is obtained from the holographic calculation , it is possible to translate it into the electromagnetic current correlator , @xmath14 , from which we can estimate the ( techni-)hadronic leading order ( hlo ) contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ( the muon @xmath0 ) . actually , in ref .",
    "@xcite a holographic estimation of such a qcd hlo contribution was done based on an earlier bottom - up holographic model  @xcite , in which , however , effects from the gluon condensation are not incorporated .    in this paper , we study the gluonic effects on the muon @xmath0 in qcd and wtc through the ( techni-)hlo contribution , based on a recently published holographic model in the bottom - up approach  @xcite .",
    "the model has 3 holographic parameters ( @xmath15 ) to be explained later ; @xmath16 and @xmath17 , roughly corresponding to the chiral condensate and the gluon condensate , respectively , at the infrared brane located at @xmath18 . by fixing the values @xmath19 mev and @xmath20 mev as inputs , we have @xmath16 and @xmath18 as functions of @xmath17 .",
    "accordingly , we show all other hadronic observables given as functions of a single holographic gluonic parameter @xmath17 : while the mass of the flavor - singlet scalar @xmath21 and the scalar glueball are insensitive to the value of @xmath17 , the mass of @xmath4 meson and the gluon condensate which are fairly sensitive to @xmath17 so that we can determine the value of @xmath22 nicely fitting the reality of all the observables studied  @xcite",
    ".    we then estimate the hlo contributions including the gluon - condensation effect , based on a formula for the hlo directly evaluated by the current correlator in the ( theoretically more tractable ) _ space - like momentum _ in contrast to the conventional one converting it to the dispersion integral from the time - like contributions where the experimental data are available .",
    "the results show that the proper inclusion of gluon - condensation effect @xmath22 causes about 6% enhancement of the hlo contribution to the muon @xmath0 : @xmath23 , @xmath24 , which are compared to the previous calculation  @xcite without gluon - condensation effect @xmath25 : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "this enhancement makes the prediction of holographic calculation of the hlo contribution very close to the known value  @xcite from the phenomenological estimate using the experimental inputs @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "we also calculate the hlo contributions to the electron and the tau lepton @xmath0 , and show that the holographic predictions are quite consistent with the known values as well .",
    "considering the fact that the energy scales important for determining the hlo effects are hierarchically different depending on the lepton species , it is remarkable that the holographic calculations , with proper inclusion of gluon - condensation effect , can reproduce hlo contributions to @xmath0 for all the leptons .",
    "this means that with inclusion of the gluonic contributions the holographic calculation of @xmath14 is quite reliable in a _ wide range of energy scale _ , and remarkably in the ( theoretically tractable ) continuous space - like momentum , not just in the range of the ( discrete ) time - like momentum where the resonance parameters are fitted in the conventional holographic studies in the zero - width approximation ( large @xmath30 limit ) .",
    "encouraged by this success , we apply the same holographic calculations of the hlo - type contributions to the @xmath0 from the wtc , with @xmath6 in qcd simply replaced by @xmath5 through the bulk scalar mass .",
    "we first show the gluonic effects on various observables in wtc , including the mass of the flavor - singlet scalar meson @xmath31 identified with td , which can be as light as the 125 gev boson discovered at the lhc for a large gluonic effect with @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "then we study the effect of such a large @xmath17 on the muon @xmath0 through the techni - hlo contribution , which we find as large as 100 times of the value for @xmath25 : imposing a typical constraint on the peskin - takeuchi @xmath33 parameter  @xcite from the electroweak ( ew ) precision test , @xmath34 , the enhancement is about 10 times and by relaxing the constraint on @xmath33 parameter as @xmath35 for the reason described in the text , the techni - hlo contribution can be further enhanced by another factor of about 10 . for all such enhancements , however ,",
    "we show that the techni - hlo contributions from wtc dynamics is negligibly small compared to the hlo contributions from qcd .",
    "it is then very unlikely that the contributions from wtc dynamics can explain the inconsistency by about 3.3 @xmath36 between the experimental value of the muon @xmath0 and the standard model ( sm ) prediction of it .",
    "we also mention the techni - hlo contribution to the tau @xmath0 , which may become relevant in future experiments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we review the model @xcite and formulas which are needed for the calculations of various physical quantities studied in this paper . in section  [ sec : qcd ] , we study the gluonic effect of the muon @xmath0 through the holographic qcd calculation of hlo contribution , based on the successful inclusion of the gluonc effects on the various hadonic observables in ref .  @xcite . in section",

    "therefore , it seems rather unlikely that the contributions from wtc dynamics can explain the current 3.3 @xmath36 deviation between experiment and the sm prediction .    in conclusion",
    "we have shown , in a bottom - up holographic model for qcd / wtc , that the amount of gluonic effects to realize the physical point ( @xmath201 for qcd and @xmath214 for wtc with @xmath215 ) makes significant effects enhancing the ( techni- ) hlo contributions to the lepton @xmath0 . since",
    "the introduction of the gluonic effects in this model is just to make the model consistent with the high energy region of the qcd , it is a highly nontrivial test of this holographic model whether or not the effects also improve the agreements with the low energy hadron physics , particularly in the most relevant momentum region @xmath216 for @xmath217 ( see fig.[fig : pi_wtc ] ) , which is far infrared region for qcd .",
    "note that the quantity studied in this paper is in the space - like momentum region @xmath218 which is theoretically more tractable without limitation of the zero - width constraint of large @xmath30 limit where the holography is so far justified , in contrast to the resonance phenomenology in the time - like region .",
    "our work presents an explicit example of a holographic model which successfully reproduces the qcd physics in all energy region from the very ultraviolet region for ope all the way down to such a deep infrared region in the space - like momentum . the vital role of the gluon condensate in wtc in connection with the light scalar composite can be clarified by the future lattice studies such as an extension of the work which observed a light flavor - singlet scalar meson in large @xmath219 qcd  @xcite .",
