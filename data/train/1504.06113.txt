    "in this paper we analyze transitions in the structure of the us , the uk , and the german stock market .",
    "in particular we observe a phase of dominance of it oriented stocks followed by a transition period that leads to a dominance of the financial sector .",
    "the analysis of the differences in the returns of stocks have long been dominated by the discussions around different versions of a capm model @xcite .",
    "the original version of the capm is in fact a one factor model , which postulates that the returns @xmath0 of the stocks should be governed by the market return @xmath1 and only differ by an idiosyncratic component @xmath2 for each stock @xmath3 , such that @xmath4 hence , stocks differ by the amount of volatility with respect to the market , and economic rational necessitates that higher stock volatility is compensated by higher absolute returns ( additionally eq .",
    "[ capm ] may incorporate the risk free interest rate ) .",
    "empirical tests of this model had rather mixed results and have let to two conclusions : more factors are needed to explain the variation of stock returns .",
    "the widely used fama and french @xcite model for example is a three - factor model that incorporates firm size and book - to - market ratio .",
    "the second conclusion was that beta values are not constant but time - varying , see @xcite .",
    "the reasons for the variability of the betas are manifold .",
    "they could change due to microeconomic factors , the business environment , macroeconomic factors , or due to changes of expectations , see , e.g. , @xcite . also models that assume a first - order auto - regressive process",
    "have been suggested , see @xcite .",
    "our approach to identify different states of a stock market consists in an analysis of a covariance matrix , similar to @xcite , and of the transaction volumes , like in @xcite .",
    "the properties of the covariance matrix of asset returns depend on the time horizon @xmath5 in which they are determined . for short @xmath5 in the order of months they are rather volatile , and partly mirror economic and political changes @xcite .",
    "@xcite for example argue that correlations increase in times of crisis , which has profound implication for portfolio choice and hedging of risks .    for large @xmath5 in the order of several years",
    ", a principal component analysis @xcite of the correlation matrix is possible .",
    "the component with the largest eigenvalue can be interpreted as the market .",
    "the @xmath6 coefficients are proportional to the corresponding eigenvector .    in order to detect changes in stock betas we use time windows of less than 4 years and a rather large numbers @xmath7 of stocks for different markets . in this case",
    "the principal component is well separated from the rest . within the assumption of market dominance motivated by implementing eq .",
    "( [ capm ] ) with a stochastic volatility model ( svm ) , one can determine the @xmath6 coefficients",
    ". a problem may be the statistical accuracy , which could be of order @xmath8 as suggested by random matrix theory @xcite .",
    "however , a monte carlo simulation shows that the errors for the @xmath6 are in the order of @xmath9 .",
    "this paper consists in a substantial extension of the research presented in @xcite , with respect both to methods and data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : methods ] we briefly describe the data sets before we describe the methodology to analyze the covariance matrix and the distribution of the stock returns . in section [ monte ]",
    "we present a monte carlo study for the error estimate on @xmath6 . after this",
    "we show the transitions in the markets and introduce a sector specific risk measure . in section",
    "[ sec : explain ] we present a model that can replicate the transitions and we discuss whether the cause of the changes is an internal or external one . section [ sec : conc ] concludes .",
    ".summary statistics of the data sets [ cols=\">,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "distribution of @xmath10 for the standardized ( @xmath11 ) market return @xmath12 for the ftse market . for @xmath13 @xmath10",

    "<S> in an analysis of the us , the uk , and the german stock market we find a change in the behavior based on the stock s beta values . before 2006 risky trades were concentrated on stocks in the it and technology sector . </S>",
