    "two - higgs doublet models ( 2hdm ) @xcite are one of the most popular extensions of the standard model ( sm ) , even without invoking supersymmetry , for which more than one scalar doublet is a necessary condition . in a 2hdm with two doublets @xmath1 and @xmath2 , there are five physical scalars : the two @xmath3-even neutrals @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the @xmath3-odd neutral @xmath6 , property if the scalar potential violates @xmath3 . for",

    "e.g. _ , ref.@xcite . ] and two charged scalars @xmath7 . while a generic 2hdm may contain flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) interactions ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite for such type of 2hdms ) , one usually invokes some discrete symmetry to banish such fcnc at the tree - level , based on the glashow - weinberg - paschos ( gwp ) @xcite theorem that there is no tree - level fcnc if all right - handed fermions of a given electric charge couple to only one of the doublets .",
    "it turns out that there are four 2hdms that satisfy the gwp criterion when a discrete @xmath0 symmetry is applied on the lagrangian .",
    "they are :    1 .",
    "type i , for which all fermions couple with @xmath2 and none with @xmath1 ; 2 .",
    "type ii , for which up - type quarks couple to @xmath2 , down - type quarks and charged leptons couple to @xmath1 ; 3 .   type y ( sometimes called type iii or flipped ) , for which up - type quarks and charged leptons couple to @xmath2 and down - type quarks couple to @xmath1 ; 4 .",
    "type x ( sometimes called type iv or lepton - specific ) , for which all charged leptons couple to @xmath1 and all quarks couple to @xmath2 .    among them ,",
    "type ii 2hdm has been most widely investigated @xcite because the scalar sector of minimal supersymmetry is a type ii 2hdm .",
    "the tightest constraint on any 2hdm comes from the fact that the observed scalar resonance at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) can be identified with the sm higgs boson with @xmath8 gev @xcite .",
    "thus , the yukawa and gauge couplings of the 2hdm must be so aligned as to make the lighter @xmath3-even mass eigenstate @xmath4 to almost coincide with the sm higgs boson .",
    "this is known as the _ alignment limit _ , and while the allowed parameter space may vary from one 2hdm to the other , the qualitative results are quite similar @xcite .",
    "there are other constraints , like the oblique parameters or the lower limit on the @xmath7 mass coming from @xmath9 decay rate @xcite , but such constraints are in general not equally valid for all 2hdms .",
    "constraint , @xmath10 gev , can be evaded in type i and lepton - specific 2hdm .",
    "] the theoretical constraints include , just like any other extensions of the sm , the vacuum stability , validity of the perturbative nature of the couplings , and constraints coming from the requirement of unitarity of scattering amplitudes @xcite .    in this paper , we will focus upon the scalar potential of the 2hdms .",
    "this is much more complicated , even at the tree - level , compared to the sm scalar potential , if both the @xmath3-even neutral scalars are allowed to have nonzero vacuum expectation values ( vev ) . as has been shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the 2hdm scalar potential , even with the softly broken @xmath0-symmetry , may allow more than one minima .",
    "a similar analysis was very recently done for @xmath0-breaking models @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the authors considered the scalar potential of a @xmath0-conserving 2hdm at the tree - level , and showed that it can allow multiple normal non - equivalent stationary points ( at most two of them can be minima ) .",
    "however , a charge - violating or @xmath3-violating minimum can not coexist with a normal minimum , _",
    "i.e. _ , where the @xmath3-even neutral fields get the vev .",
    "this can be put in a more succinct way : minima with different natures can not co - exist in 2hdm @xcite . also , the data from lhc all but rules out those points where the second minimum is deeper than the electroweak ( ew ) minimum , _",
    "i.e. _ , the minimum where the universe lives .    in this paper , we consider both @xmath0-conserving and @xmath0-violating 2hdm scalar potentials for our analysis . by @xmath0-breaking 2hdm ,",
    "we mean those with dimension-4 operators violating @xmath0 , like @xmath11 or @xmath12 .",
    "there can be soft @xmath0-violating terms like @xmath13 or @xmath14 in the potential ; if there are no dimension-4 @xmath0-breaking terms , we call those models @xmath0-conserving , although , strictly speaking , they are not .",
    "we show that the conclusions drawn about the nature of the minima of the potential in the context of @xmath0-conserving 2hdms remain valid for @xmath0-violating 2hdms too .    to check the robustness of the tree - level results , we further perform a one - loop analysis of the 2hdm potential , and choose only those models that show a double minima .",
    "a nice review of the one - loop corrections in the context of @xmath0-symmetric 2hdm and scale invariant 2hdm can be found in refs .",
    "it is a common knowledge that the one - loop corrections @xcite can be significant only in the flat direction of the potential . for the sm ,",
    "this is easy to obtain @xcite ; so is for the inert doublet models @xcite where one of the vevs is zero . for a generic 2hdm ,",
    "this is a cumbersome task , but can be done , in principle , following the prescriptions of gildener and weinberg @xcite , and the ray in the potential space along which the tree - level potential is zero can be found .",
    "however , if @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the vevs of the @xmath3-even neutral components of @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively ( so that @xmath18 ) , the potential along the @xmath1 direction is _ almost _ flat , so it is instructive to show the variations of the potential perpendicular to this direction , _",
    "i.e. _ , along @xmath2 .",
    "another important point is the setting of the regularization scale @xmath19 for the one - loop corrections .",
    "variation of @xmath19 is equivalent to the variations of the tree - level quartic couplings @xmath20 , as can be seen from a renormalization group argument . as the nature of the potential",
    "can best be described by these quartic couplings , we would like to forward a prescription of choosing @xmath19 for the 2hdm : choose it so that the position of the ew minimum remains unaltered .",
    "as we will see , this keeps the position of the second minimum too almost unaltered .",
    "of course , the depths of the potential at the two minima will change .",
    "with such a prescription for choosing @xmath19 , the conclusions about the stability of the ew minimum that were drawn from a tree - level analysis remain unaltered .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly review 2hdms , with softly broken @xmath0 symmetry and without @xmath0 symmetry , and list the constraints and the minimization conditions on the potential .",
    "section iii introduces the one - loop corrected effective potential and modified minimization conditions for type ii 2hdm with and without @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "our results , for both tree - level and one - loop analysis , are shown in section iv .",
    "section v summarizes the paper .",
    "some calculation details and relevant expressions are relegated to the appendix .",
    "to start with , let us focus on the most canonical 2hdms , where the @xmath0 symmetry is broken only softly by a dimension-2 operator , and all the couplings are real .",
    "the notations used here essentially follow those in ref .",
    "later on , we will introduce both dimension-4 @xmath0-breaking operators as well as complex parameters in the scalar potential .",

    "we find a few common characteristics for these models that allow two minima .",
    "they are : +",
    "( i ) the ew vacuum is always deeper than the other vacuum .",
    "this happens mostly because of the imposition of the experimental constraints .",
    "thus , even with the introduction of @xmath0-breaking parameters , there is no chance of tunneling to the other minimum , at least at the tree - level .",
    "this reinforces the conclusions obtained by the authors of ref .",
    "+ ( ii ) if both the vacua are normal , there is no other minimum that breaks charge conservation or @xmath3 .",
    "this , again , is in tune of what the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite found .",
    "we would now like to perform the same analysis on the one - loop corrected potential on those models that satisfy the initial constraints and show the presence of a double minima at the tree - level .",
    "the regularization scale @xmath19 is so chosen as to make @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "this is , of course , a rather restrictive choice , but keeps all the masses as well as @xmath107 unchanged at the ew minimum even after the one - loop corrections are implemented .    in a generic 2hdm where both cp - even neutral fields can get nonzero vev ,",
    "this is a tricky job , and mathematically much more complicated than the cases of only sm , or sm extended by a gauge singlet scalar , or the inert doublet models where one vev is always zero .",
    "the complication is further enhanced by the fact that at the tree - level , there are two minima of the potential .",
    "what we do is the following .",
    "we fix @xmath85 and tune @xmath19 in such a way that @xmath84 coincides with @xmath17 .",
    "this keeps the position of the ew minimum invariant but changes the depth .",
    "we could have done this the other way round too , namely , keeping @xmath86 and adjusting @xmath19 to make @xmath83 coincide with the tree level value ; however , we prefer the first approach as the contribution of @xmath17 is larger in @xmath108 for @xmath109 .",
    "we then use the same @xmath19 but fix the classical minimum for @xmath35 at @xmath110 .",
    "it so happens that @xmath111 , in all cases , lies close to @xmath112 ; the coincidence is not as exact as the ew vacuum , but this being the shallower secondary minimum , we will not be so much bothered about its exact position .",
    "thus , we compare @xmath113 with @xmath114 .",
    "we will also show the effect of varying the scale @xmath19 on the classical field values .",
    "what we observe is that the conclusions drawn from a tree - level analysis is more or less unchanged ; the deeper minimum remains deeper .",
    "this is not entirely unexpected , as the one - loop corrections are only a small effect that can not overcome the difference in depths of these two minima . for @xmath115 ,",
    "@xmath35 direction is almost flat , so we show our results in the constant-@xmath35 direction , varying the potential @xmath47 with @xmath36 .",
    "our results are discussed in more detail later for some typical benchmark points , but for both the cases that we consider ( @xmath0 conserving and breaking ) , we never found the second minimum becoming deeper than the ew one after the one - loop corrections .",
    "thus , if the ew vacuum is the deeper one at tree - level , it remains so after the radiative corrections ; there is no chance of developing a deeper vacuum and tunnelling into it .",
    "in fact , if @xmath19 is tuned in such a way that the ew vacuum is not shifted from its tree - level position , _ it always gets deeper by the one - loop corrections _ ; @xmath116 at the ew vacuum is always negative .      in table",
    "[ tab : tab - bench ] , we show three benchmark points for the @xmath0-conserving type - ii 2hdm , characterized by small , medium , and large values of @xmath117 respectively .",
    "all these models show the existence of a second and shallower minimum compared to the ew one .",
    "these three models , namely , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 are valid up to @xmath121 gev , @xmath122 gev , and the planck scale respectively ; for the first two models , at least one of the couplings become nonperturbative at the validity scale and the model soon hits the landau pole thereafter . obviously , the comparatively low validity range for the first benchmark can be ascribed to the relatively large quadratic couplings to start with at the ew scale .",
    "the evolutions are checked with one - loop renormalization group equations for the type ii 2hdm @xcite .",
    ".benchmark points for @xmath0-conserving type - ii 2hdm . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]      ( l ) and @xmath111 ( r ) with @xmath19 for @xmath123 ( blue ) , @xmath124 ( red ) , and @xmath125 ( golden).,title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=188 ]   ( l ) and @xmath111 ( r ) with @xmath19 for @xmath123 ( blue ) , @xmath124 ( red ) , and @xmath125 ( golden).,title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=188 ]    just like the @xmath0-conserving case , we choose three benchmarks for the case where the potential violates the @xmath0 and also involves complex parameters .",
    "these benchmarks are shown in table [ tab : tab - bench2 ] .",
    "the flatness of the potential in the @xmath35 direction is again most manifest for @xmath125 , the benchmark with lowest @xmath16 . at the same time , the ew minimum always gets deeper with the one - loop corrected potential , and there is no qualitative change from the tree - level result . because of the comparatively large values of the couplings , all the three models tend to hit the landau pole much before the planck scale , namely , at 45.8 tev , 4.8 tev , and 216.7 tev .",
    "this is expected because @xmath124 starts with larger values of the quartic couplings at the ew scale . in general , for the double - minima case when @xmath0 is broken , most of the couplings at the ew scale have to be large to start with and thus such class of models are not stable beyond a few hundreds of tev , which may be contrasted with the @xmath0-conserving double - minima models .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : varz2asymm ] , we show how @xmath84 and @xmath111 changes with @xmath19 for the three benchmarks .",
    "in this paper we have tried to investigate the nature of the potential of type ii 2hdm , breaking the @xmath0 symmetry either softly or through dimension-4 operators . there are some known results for the @xmath0-symmetric 2hdm at the tree level .",
    "our goal was to investigate how far these conslusions are reliable if one ( i ) breaks the @xmath0 symmetry at the tree level with operators with real or complex couplings , ( ii ) does a one - loop correction on the potential .",
    "for the first part , we find that the introduction of @xmath0 breaking does not change the conclusions qualitatively : the scalar potential can accommodate at most two local minima , both of which have to be normal . if there is a normal minimum , there can not be a charge - breaking or @xmath3 violating minimum of the potential .",
    "the lhc data highly disfavours those models where the second minimum is deeper than the ew minimum , possibly making the ew vacuum an unstable or metastable one .    for one - loop corrections ,",
    "we use a regularization scale that keeps the position of the ew minimum invariant , changing only its depth .",
    "when we focus on models with two minima , this prescription keeps the position of the second minima almost unchanged too .",
    "the one - loop corrections can not change the relative depths of the minima , _",
    "i.e. _ , the ew minimum still remains deeper after the correction , ruling out the possibility of a metastable vacuum .",
    "the conclusions are identical for @xmath0 symmetric and @xmath0 breaking 2hdm .",
    "while the conclusions were drawn for type ii 2hdm , the results are qualitatively the same for other 2hdms too , as the only change comes from the yukawa couplings that enter the one - loop corrections .",
    "the stability of the 2hdm at higher energy scales is a complex issue because of more fields and couplings .",
    "one needs the stability conditions to be valid at all scales and the couplings to remain perturbative for calculability ( or , at least , not blow up ) .",
    "a general tendency that can intuitively be deduced from the rg equations is that higher values of quartic couplings at the ew scale tend to pull down the range of validity of the theory , which means that some other ultraviolet complete theory takes hold beyond that range .",
    "however , a large part of the parameter space is still compatible with the stability up to the planck scale for the @xmath0-conserving class of models . for the @xmath0-violating class ,",
    "the existence of two minima generally forces some of the quartic couplings to be large at the ew scale and hence such models cease to be valid beyond a few hundreds of tev at the most ; for smaller couplings , one gets the single - minimum models .",

    "<S> we perform a detailed analysis of the two - higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) potential . at the tree - level , the potential may accommodate more than one minima , one of them being the electroweak ( ew ) minimum where the universe lives . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter space allowed after the data from the large hadron collider ( lhc ) came in almost excludes those cases where the ew vacuum is shallower than the second minimum . </S>",
    "<S> we extend the analysis by including terms in the 2hdm potential that break the @xmath0 symmetry of the potential by dimension-4 operators and show that the conclusions remain unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a one - loop analysis of the potential is performed for both cases , namely , where the @xmath0 symmetry of the potential is broken by dimension-2 or dimension-4 operators . for quantitative analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we show our results for the type - ii 2hdm , qualitative results remaining the same for other 2hdms . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the nature of the vacua from the tree - level analysis does not change ; the ew vacuum still remains deeper .    </S>",
