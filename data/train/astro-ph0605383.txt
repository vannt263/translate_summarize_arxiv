    "capella ( @xmath3 aurigae @xmath4 hd  34029 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 45  59  53   in epoch 2000.0 ) is a well - studied binary system consisting mainly of two cool giants : g8   and g1   ( often labeled as aa and ab , respectively ) .",

    "generally both gap and clump stars show hot ( @xmath810@xmath1k ) coronal emission measure distribution , although gap stars are often found more deficient in x - rays than clump stars ( ayres et al .",

    "johnson et al . ( 2002 ) , instead , found in 1999 with the _ hst_/space telescope imaging spectrograph that the g8 star exhibited a negligible contribution to the same line , indicating that the 10@xmath1k plasma of the g8 star was variable on a long time scale .",

    "to determine accurate doppler velocities of the bright emission lines in the capella spectrum , we followed this procedure : ( 1 ) select a region of capella s spectrum containing strong emission lines ; ( 2 ) fit the line position of the @xmath161@xmath17 orders of the heg and meg spectra separately ; and then ( 3 ) calculate this region s doppler velocity .",

    "the three free parameters , the normalization of line emission and the apparent doppler velocity and width , were then fit by minimizing the c - statistic using the levenberg - marquardt method as implemented in isis version 1.3.0 ( houck & denicola 2000 ) . all quoted errors in the doppler velocity term correspond to 3@xmath24 confidence levels ( see the fifth and sixth columns in table  1 ) .",
    "the regions were selected to include bright emission lines ; the selected spectral regions and emission lines included in the fitting process are tabulated in table  2 .",
    "once all the measurements were done , we took all of the velocities per wavelength region per grating , rejected the highest and lowest ( i.e. , _ possibly anomalous _ ) data points , and then took the mean as the apparent velocity of the system .",
    "the measured doppler widths were small and statistically insignificant ( @xmath25150  km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "each measurement of apparent doppler velocity needed to be corrected for the barycentric motion of the earth around the center of mass of the solar system .",
    "the barycentric correction was made using the algorithm of @xcite .",
    "although we also applied the correction for the motion of the spacecraft , it turned out to be insignificant for our analysis . even at its maximum ,",

    "figure  1 shows the apparent radial velocities of capella measured without barycentric correction .",
    "the data points are seemingly randomly scattered , though close comparison with the calculated apparent radial motion of _ the primary capella aa _ ( the dashed curve ) indicates that the observed hard x - ray emission lines of capella trace the primary star s motion .",

    "the velocity vs.   phase diagram makes it clearer that the x - ray emission lines detected with the _",
    "chandra_/hetgs closely trace the motion of capella s primary star , as opposed to the secondary .",
    "in six years of monitoring capella , the _",
    "chandra_/hetgs data reveal that the doppler shifts of the bright x - ray emission lines closely follow the primary star of the capella system .",
    "this implies that the g8   primary star has been the dominant x - ray source of 10@xmath1  k plasma , at least , in the last six years .",
    "the identity of the dominant source of hot plasma in the capella system has been somewhat controversial .",
    "it was long suspected that the g8 giant was responsible for the hard x - ray plasma , since the secondary star belongs to the class of x - ray deficient stars ( late f ",
    "early g giants ; see ayres et al .",
    "this view is strongly supported by a _",
    "far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _",
    "observation of capella , which concluded that the far uv fe  xviii  @xmath9974.85 flux ( formed at 10@xmath0  k ) originated solely from the g8 star s corona ( young et al .",
    "the evidence pointing to the slower - rotating g8 star as the dominating source of coronal emission is particularly interesting , considering that the g1 star appears to dominate the uv emission formed at lower temperatures ( @xmath41  k in the transition region and chromosphere ; see woods & ayres 1995 and linsky et al .",
    "1995 ) . on the contrary , the detection of strong fe  xxi @xmath91354 ( formed at 10@xmath1  k ) far - uv emission from the g1 star with the _ hst_/stis by johnson et al .",
    "implies that the g1 giant might have dominated the hotter plasma ( c.f .",
    "linsky et al .",
    "variability in luminosity is another issue for concern , as capella ( notably the g8 component ) is known to vary in the hottest uv emission lines ( fe   to ; see brickhouse et al .",
    "2000 and ayres et al .",
    "2003 ) . in x - rays",
    ", however , it is considered to be a steady source with no prior detection of flares ( e.g. , see argiroffi et al .",
    "is it then reasonable to infer that the two giants in capella are remarkably steady x - ray sources ?",
    "light curves of fe and ne emission lines in figure  3 illustrate that this is not necessarily the case . based on the integrated line fluxes measured in fe",
    "@xmath912.28 , three fe   @xmath1512.27 + 17.05 + 17.10 , and ne x ly@xmath3 @xmath42 lines , it appears that the line flux from the cooler plasma ( i.e. , fe   and ne   lines ) changes by 20  50% over time , while the hottest emission line ( fe  ) is more modulated ( by a factor of two ) than the cooler counterpart .",
    "furthermore , the two largest modulations of fe   in line flux were observed in the last two observations of capella ( mjd = 53258.924 and 53457.553 , or phase = 0.092 and 0.002 , respectively ) .",
    "examining figure  2 closely , we notice that these two barycentric radial velocities are significantly lower than expected .",
    "it is suggestive that the deviation of the last two data points is probably due to an increasing level of contamination by the secondary s line emission flux originating from hot 10@xmath1  k plasma .",
    "this scenario is supported by the observed characteristics of thermal distribution of plasma in single giants analogous to the components of capella .",
    "the clump k0 giant @xmath43  cet , analogous to capella aa , shows a thermal distribution sharply peaked at @xmath44  k ( ayres et al .",
    "1998 ) ; on the other hand , the hertzsprung gap g0 giant 31  com , analogous to capella ab , is characterized instead by a temperature distribution steeply increasing up to the @xmath45  k peak temperature and a large amount of plasma at even hotter temperatures ( scelsi et al .",
    "2004 ) . assuming that the capella components have analogous thermal structures , it is then reasonable to assume that the g8 star is the stronger x - ray source , but the g1 star significantly contributes to the hotter emission at @xmath46  k. figure  4 shows that _ indeed _ bright and isolated mg   ly@xmath3 doublets can be fit well with two line components associated with capella aa and ab . in the lower panel of figure  4 , the dashed line centered at barycenter - corrected radial doppler velocity @xmath4755  km",
    "s@xmath2 is the mg   doublets from capella aa ( g8  ) and the dotted line centered at @xmath472  km  s@xmath2 is the same doublets from capella  ab ( g1  ) .",
    "the composite of the two models is shown as the solid line in the top panel of figure  4 . in this preliminary analysis ,",
    "the intrinsic line widths for both components were set to zero . to quantify the velocity perturbation in terms of how much flux",
    "would be required from the secondary star to offset the radial velocity , the normalization terms for each line component were allowed to vary .",
    "the best fit resulted from the line flux ratio ( g8/g1 ) of 1.8 : 1 in the mg   feature .",
    "the weighted mean for the two doppler velocities is @xmath48 , which is reasonably close to the measured radial velocity of 39.2  km  s@xmath2 ( see table  1 ) .",
    "this finding indicates that the secondary star may have contributed as much as one third of the flux in the hetgs wave - band during the observations for obsid 5040 and 5955 .",
    "this analysis of variation in integrated line flux is still very preliminary and a further discussion is deferred to a future publication .",
    "lastly we find that the _ chandra_/hetgs appears to be a very stable instrument in the long run .",
    "the improvements in the acis - s geometry values and the meg grating period ( provided in caldb 3.0.1 , version geomn0005 ) further enhance its capability to detect a miniscule dynamic motion of an astrophysical source .",
    "the differences between the measured and expected doppler velocity of capella  aa generally lie under 20 km  s@xmath2 , which we shall consider as the systematic uncertainty in doppler velocity determination using the entire coverage of the hetgs . as for absolute wavelength determination ( i.e. , per emission line ) , inspection of our detailed fits",
    "indicates that the _ r.m.s .",
    "_ of the differences derived per emission line are 25 and 33  km  s@xmath2 with the heg and meg , respectively .",
