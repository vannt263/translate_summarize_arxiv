    "first , we would like to recall why the measurement postulate has been introduced in the orthodox interpretation of the quantum theory .",
    "let us assume that a system of particles is completely described by a wave - function , that always evolves according to a linear equation ( such as the schrdinger equation ) .",
    "we plan to measure an observable @xmath0 of the system .",
    "to measure the observable @xmath0 , one has to build an apparatus that correlate the eigenstates of @xmath0 to position eigenstates of the apparatus , so that any measurement is finally a measurement of positions .",
    "for example , when the spin component of a spin-@xmath1 particle is measured , as in the stern - gerlach experiment , we finally measure a point on a screen , so a position ( either in the upper half - plate , either in the lower half - plate ) .",
    "this remark is important since it gives a privileged role to position , and so superpositions get an absolute meaning . now if we prepare the system in a superposition of eigenstates of @xmath0 , and if we send it towards the measuring apparatus , we can obtain superpositions of macroscopic objects ( measuring devices , cats , humans , and so on ) , on account of the linear character of the equation of motion .",
    "but we do not observe those macroscopic superpositions , but eigenstates of the observable being measured , with probabilities given by born s law . in order to account for the experimental results ,",
    "the measurement postulate is introduced :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ when an observer measure the observable @xmath0 of the system , he founds one of the eigenvalues of @xmath0 , with probability given by born s law .",
    "because of the repeatability of experiments , the wave - function of the system collapses to the corresponding eigenstate when the measurement occurs . _",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the measurement postulate introduces a boundary between two worlds : a quantum world , made of systems , described by wave - functions , and a classical world , made of observers , described by positions . what is wrong with that ? according to the orthodox interpretation , there is no element of reality in the quantum world : the particles of the quantum world do not have any probability of being anywhere ( they do not exist ) .",
    "elements of the classical world do have such probabilities : they exist ( their positions are elements of reality ) . and the orthodox interpretation offers no explanation for that .",
    "people whose main concern is quantum gravity must face this kind of problem , for it is meaningless to speak of a wave - function of the universe in the orthodox interpretation .",
    "to get rid of the frontier between the classical and the quantum worlds , one could say that the world is described by a wave - function and by the positions of the particles that it contains .",
    "there is a theory , built along these lines ; it is the non - relativistic de broglie - bohm pilot - wave theory .",
    "pilot - wave theory is a realistic theory , in so far as the positions of the particles exist and are simply revealed by position measurements ( the positions are beables , a term coined by bell ) .",
    "if there are @xmath2 particles , the universe is thus completely described by the couple @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a point in a configuration space of dimension @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 evolves according to the schrdinger equation , whereas the equation of motion for @xmath7 is such that if we consider a set of universes with the same wave - function and initial configurations chosen according to the probability density @xmath8 , then the final configurations will be distributed according to @xmath9 ( for any later time @xmath10 ) .",
    "so the non - relativistic pilot - wave theory gives the same experimental predictions as the orthodox interpretation of the non - relativistic quantum theory , without relying on concepts such as systems and observers .",
    "pilot - wave theory is weakly non - local ; that means that the equation of motion for the positions of the particles is non - local , but that does not lead to any supra - luminal signaling .",
    "now , the widespread claim is that those interpretations are ruled out by bell s inequality ( @xcite , chap 7 ) and the experiments that have been carried out later .",
    "if fact local ones are ruled out , but since non - locality is commonly claimed to be unacceptable ( even weak non - locality , which does not lead to paradoxical situations ) , it is said that any hidden - variables theory is incompatible with the quantum theory .",
    "that is the wrong way to present the theoretical situation . to present it correctly",
    ", we have to return to the epr paradox @xcite , which in essence says that some quantum correlations can not be explained in a local way , unless we say that the quantum theory is incomplete .",
    "since local hidden - variables theories are ruled out by bell s inequality and experiments , the only way to explain quantum correlations is to revert to non - locality ( which is in fact hidden in the collapse postulate ) . then , to suppress the ill - defined measurement postulate , it is preferable to interpret the quantum theory by a non - local hidden - variables theory , such as the non - relativistic pilot - wave theory",
    ". it is worth underlining that bell , who is often credited of the refutation of hidden - variables theories , has been one of the main advocates of the pilot - wave theory ( @xcite , chap .",
    "11 , 14 , 15 and 17 ) .",
    "the question that comes to mind is to know if the quantum field theory can also be interpreted as a non - local hidden - variables theory . at the time bell",
    "wrote his paper @xcite ( or @xcite , chap .",
    "19 ) , bohm had already shown that it was possible to build a realistic interpretation of any bosonic quantum field theory @xcite . to achieve that goal ,",
    "bohm took the field as the beable , however he was not able to do the same for fermions .",
    "the aim of bell was then to show that it was also possible to build a realistic interpretation of any fermionic quantum field theory , along the pilot - wave ideas @xcite .",
    "bell managed doing so but he took a different beable : the fermion number density .",
    "it is slightly different from the non - relativistic pilot - wave theory , whose beables are the positions of the particles .",
    "the model is also formulated on a spatial lattice ( space is discrete but time remains continuous ) .",
    "his model is stochastic , but he suspected that the theory would become deterministic in the continuum limit .",
    "we have shown @xcite that it is indeed the case , so that there is a deterministic bell model .    in this article , we consider in more details the deterministic bell model for quantum electrodynamics .",
    "first , we will give a brief presentation of the non - relativistic pilot - wave theory , since the deterministic bell model is in fact very similar to it .",
    "then , we will give a presentation of the dirac quantum field theory , axed around the notion of negative - energy electrons .",
    "in that approach , there are only particles of charge @xmath11 but of positive and negative energy : their total number ( fermion - number ) is conserved .",
    "we will see that this approach is a convenient one to study localized properties ( such as fermion - number density ) . the reinterpretation of the theory is then made in terms of positrons , as holes in the dirac sea . in section [ sec : dbm ] , we build the deterministic bell model for the free dirac quantum field theory .",
    "in the next section , the results are generalized to quantum electrodynamics .",
    "let us consider a system containing @xmath2 non - relativistic electrons . in the orthodox interpretation ,",
    "these electrons are completely described by a wave - function @xmath12 , which is the solution of the schrdinger equation ( @xmath13 are spin - component indices ) . the probability density to observe the system in a configuration @xmath14 at time @xmath10",
    "is given by @xmath15 from the relation @xmath16 and with the help of the schrdinger equation , it can be shown , at least in the usual cases , that there exist currents @xmath17 such that @xmath18 we use @xmath4 as a short notation for @xmath14 .",
    "the main idea of the pilot - wave theory is to say that the positions of the electrons are in fact elements of reality ( or beables ) ; that means that the electrons have definite positions @xmath19 that are simply revealed by position measurements .",
    "so the complete description of a system at time @xmath10 would involve the wave - function @xmath12 , but also the @xmath2 position variables @xmath19 . to complete the theory",
    ", one must give the equations of motion for these objects .",
    "for the wave - function , the schrdinger equation is retained .",
    "as far as the position variables are concerned , the only constraint on the equation of motion is that the predictions of the orthodox interpretation of the quantum theory are reproduced .",
    "is there a general form for that equation of motion ?",
    "there are only two basic objects defined at time @xmath10 : the wave - function of the system and the position of the system ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "so the velocity of the system would be fixed by those objects .",
    "in other words , the equation of motion is a velocity - law : @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "let us see what is the constraint imposed on the velocity - law by requiring that the pilot - wave theory is in agreement with the orthodox quantum theory .",
    "let us define @xmath23 as the probability density for the system to be in configuration @xmath4 at time @xmath10 .",
    "the probability density is defined in the usual way : we consider a set of systems , labeled by an index @xmath24 , with the same wave - function but different realizations of the beable @xmath25 .",
    "then the probability density is defined over these many experiments @xmath24 . if the positions are simply revealed by position measurements , the probability density for the system to be observed in a configuration @xmath4 is equal to the probability density for the system to be in configuration @xmath4 .",
    "hence , to reproduce the predictions of the orthodox quantum theory , the following relation @xmath26 must be satisfied .",
    "let us assume that this is true for some initial time @xmath27 ; then the relation that must be satisfied is @xmath28 we first consider the right - hand part .",
    "a consequence of the conservation of the total probability @xmath29 is the existence of a continuity equation @xmath30 with the help of eq .",
    "( [ ce ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ pwce ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ constraint ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath31 taking @xmath32 the predictions of the orthodox quantum theory are regained .",
    "a complete study of the pilot - wave theory can be found in @xcite .",
    "our aim now is to show that the idea of positive and negative energy electrons is convenient for the study of localized properties , such as fermion - number density ( or charge density ) .",
    "the classical dirac equation is @xmath33 where the hermitian matrices @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) satisfy the relations @xmath37 and where @xmath38 is a four - component spinor field . a particular representation of the matrices is given by the pauli - dirac choice : @xmath39 where the @xmath40 are the usual pauli matrices .",
    "the dirac equation can be rewritten in a covariant form by introducing the @xmath41 matrices , defined by the relations @xmath42 doing so leads to @xmath43 it can also be shown that the @xmath41 matrices satisfy the relations @xmath44 .",
    "then , it is easy to check that each component of the dirac field is a solution of the klein - gordon equation @xmath45 with @xmath46 . since the free solutions of the k - g equation are @xmath47 and @xmath48 , with @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the general forms of the free solutions of the dirac equation are @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath50 . to give an interpretation of the dirac equation",
    ", one must find a conserved current , whose time - component is positive ; the current @xmath53 , where @xmath54 , is suitable .",
    "the quantity @xmath55 is thus the probability density to find an electron at point @xmath56 at time @xmath10 .",
    "normalization still remains to be discussed .",
    "if the free particle has momentum @xmath57 in an inertial frame @xmath58 , where the universe appears to have a volume @xmath59 , then the following relation must be satisfied : @xmath60 in every inertial frame .",
    "that means that the spinors must be normalized to @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the volume of the universe in the inertial frame where the particle is at rest .",
    "the time component of the current is positive , a task that was impossible with the klein - gordon equation .",
    "but the negative energy states are still there .",
    "once interactions are taken into account , their presence would lead to the instability of the hydrogen atom , for example . to avoid this",
    ", dirac has assumed that all the negative energy states were occupied .",
    "hence a positive energy electron can not transit to a negative energy state , due to the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "that state of lowest energy is called the dirac sea .",
    "the absence of a negative energy state of momentum @xmath63 ( a hole in the dirac sea ) would be seen as a particle of positive energy @xmath64 , momentum @xmath65 and charge @xmath66 . that led eventually to the prediction of anti - particles known as positrons .",
    "the first step , in the construction of the corresponding quantum field theory , is to find a real classical relativistic action , that leads to the dirac equation , when the variational principle is applied on it .",
    "the following action @xmath67\\psi(t,\\vec{x})\\ ] ] is a good candidate .",
    "it is real , up to a four - divergence .",
    "the momenta conjugate to the fields are @xmath68 the next step is quantization ; classical fields become quantum fields , satisfying the equal - time canonical anti - commutation relations @xmath69 since the quantum field @xmath38 is a solution of the dirac equation , it is a superposition of free classical solutions with operators as coefficients : @xmath70\\ ] ] ( summation is made over all the momentum @xmath71 , with @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) .",
    "taking @xmath74 and all other anti - commutators vanishing , the relations ( [ car ] ) are regained .",
    "let us now give an interpretation of the operators @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the hamiltonian is obtained through the legendre transformation @xmath77 the momentum is @xmath78 we define the fermion - number as the operator @xmath79 @xmath80 being the fermion - number density .",
    "fermion - number means number of fermions , that is number of positive - energy electrons plus number of negative - energy electrons .",
    "the fermion - number is conserved ( @xmath81=0 $ ] ) ; the corresponding current is @xmath82 with @xmath83 . since there are only electrons of charge @xmath11 , the fact that the fermion - number is conserved is equivalent to the charge conservation .",
    "the current @xmath84 is @xmath85 the charge density is @xmath86 and the charge current is @xmath87 .",
    "we define a vacuum @xmath88 as a state destroyed by the operators @xmath75 and @xmath76 : @xmath89 this vacuum @xmath88 is not the dirac sea ( the dirac sea is obtained from @xmath88 by filling all the negative - energy states ) .",
    "then @xmath90 and @xmath91 are naturally interpreted as a one - electron states .",
    "here is an array with the properties of the one - electron states @xmath92 we see that the negative - energy electrons are not appropriated to the momentum space : it is difficult to give an interpretation of the state @xmath91 since it has a charge @xmath11 , momentum @xmath63 and a charge current @xmath93 . however , these states are well suited to the study of localized properties . to see that ,",
    "let us switch to the schrdinger picture ; the schrdinger fields are the heisenberg fields taken at time @xmath94 @xmath95 and we have the schrdinger equation @xmath96 the fermion - number @xmath97 is the total number of positive - energy and negative - energy electrons , and the density of electrons ( or fermion - number density ) is thus given by @xmath98 what are the eigenstates of the the fermion - number density ?",
    "let us start from a state @xmath99 , such that @xmath100 and apply on operator @xmath101 on @xmath99 . from eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) and from the relations ( [ car ] ) , it can be seen that @xmath102 so that any of the four operators @xmath101 creates a quantum of the fermion - number at point @xmath103 .",
    "thus the signification of @xmath101 is that it creates an electron at point @xmath103 . in the same way",
    ", it can be seen that the operators @xmath104 are annihilators of electrons at point @xmath103 . to obtain the eigenstates of the fermion - number density",
    ", one has to start from a state which is annihilated by any operator @xmath104 and apply various creators @xmath105 on it .",
    "that state is simply the vacuum @xmath88 : @xmath106 here is an array with the first eigenstates of the fermion - number density .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the structure of the fock space is then @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the hilbert space with fermion - number number equal to @xmath109 ( thus completely spanned by the orthonormal basis @xmath110 ) , where @xmath111 is the direct sum , @xmath112 the direct - product , and @xmath113 means that the space is restricted to its antisymmetric part .    since @xmath81=0 $ ] and in accordance with the well - known super - selection rule that forbids superpositions of states with different values of the fermion - number , we know that @xmath114 is an eigenstate of the fermion - number .",
    "let us consider the case where there is only one quantum of the fermion - number : @xmath115 then @xmath114 can be decomposed along the eigenstates of the fermion - number density ( @xmath116 ) with fermion - number equal to @xmath109 ; these eigenstates are @xmath117 thus , in our case , @xmath118 inserting the previous equation in the schrdinger equation , using the relations ( [ car ] ) , and the definition of the hamiltonian , one finds that @xmath119 which is the dirac equation .",
    "so the link is made between the first and the second quantization .",
    "usually , the theory formalism is rewritten by introducing the positrons , thanks to the the substitutions @xmath120 then another vacuum has to be defined ( let us call it @xmath121 ) : @xmath122 that vacuum @xmath121 is the usual vacuum .",
    "the operator @xmath123 is replaced by @xmath124 , which is also equal to @xmath125 .",
    "making that substitution in the previous observables leads to @xmath126 up to some constants which have been dropped .",
    "another observable is usually defined , when we talk of positrons and electrons ; it is the particle - number @xmath127 the properties of the one - particle states are @xmath128 thus , when we study properties related to the momentum space , the electrons and positrons point of view is the best one .",
    "however , the localized - particle states are not so natural .",
    "these states are defined as the eigenstates of the operator @xmath129~,\\ ] ] where @xmath130 eigenstates of the particle density are obtained from the vacuum @xmath121 by applying several creators @xmath131 or @xmath132 on it .",
    "these states are the newton - wigner states .",
    "the particle - number is different from the fermion - number @xmath133 ( where @xmath134 is an infinite constant ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the particle - number does not commute with the fermion - number density @xmath116 .",
    "it is possible to find well - behaved functions @xmath135 such that @xmath136\\neq 0~.\\ ] ] the proof is given in appendix [ sec : appb ] . in the electrons and positrons point of view , the charge density is defined as @xmath137 where the dots mean normal - ordering .",
    "a corollary is that eigenstates of the charge density are not eigenstates of the particle - number .",
    "in the non - relativistic pilot - wave theory , the hidden variables are the positions of the particles . in the quantum field theory context",
    ", what hidden variables must we choose ?",
    "the first natural answer seems to be the particle density .",
    "we will now argue why the particle - density ( eq .",
    "( [ partdens ] ) ) is not a good choice for a beable .",
    "the first point is that the observable @xmath138 appears very artificial , since it is not made of the fields @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "remember that any measurement is made with a measuring apparatus that correlate eigenstates of the observable being measured to eigenstates of the apparatus .",
    "so , when we look at localized properties , we are interested in hamiltonian densities .",
    "of course , @xmath138 is hermitian , but that does not imply that it has a physical meaning .",
    "in fact , when we measure localized properties , if we want to attain high precision , we have to use high energy ( small wavelengths ) , and that leads to pairs creation .",
    "so it seems that the idea of an eigenstate containing a particle localized in a small region , looses his meaning when the region is sufficiently small .",
    "there is a second argument that shows that @xmath138 does not have physical meaning : if we start from a state @xmath141 at time @xmath10 and if we let it evolve according to the schrdinger equation for a small time @xmath142 , then it can be shown that it has a small probability to be outside the light - cone of the event @xmath143 ( see @xcite and also @xcite ) .",
    "the third point is more related to the general ideas of the pilot - wave theory .",
    "in fact , the crucial ingredient of the pilot - wave theory is the existence of a continuity equation linked to the chosen beable .",
    "since the particle number is not conserved , we do not expect such an equation for the particle density .    in the non - relativistic pilot - wave theory ,",
    "the hidden variable is the particle density , but since there are only electrons , the particle density is proportional to the charge density .",
    "then can we take the charge density as the beable ? that has been suggested by bell , in his interpretation of the lattice fermionic quantum field theories @xcite . to be more precise , bell suggested that the fermion - number density @xmath116 could be given the beable status .",
    "all the critics that we made of the particle density do not apply to the fermion - number density .",
    "the fermion - number density does not commute with the particle number .",
    "if we start from a state @xmath144 at time @xmath10 , the charge will stay in the light cone . and",
    "finally , the fermion - number is conserved , so we expect a continuity equation .",
    "since the fermion - number is conserved ( @xmath81=0 $ ] ) , and in accordance with the well - known super - selection rule , the pilot - state @xmath114 is an eigenstate of the fermion - number ; let us define the corresponding eigenvalue by @xmath145 : @xmath146 .",
    "so the pilot - state can be decomposed along the eigenstates of the fermion - number density with fermion - number equal to @xmath145 : @xmath147 .",
