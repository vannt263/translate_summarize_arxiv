    "cassiopeia a is thought to have exploded around @xmath6 , based on radial velocity and proper motion measurements of 15 of the supernova remnant s high - velocity [ n ii]-emitting knots , also called fast - moving flocculi or fmfs ( fesen , becker , & goodrich 1988 ) . indeed ,",
    "flamsteed ( 1725 ) observed a 6th magnitude star within 13@xmath7 of cassiopeia a s location in 1680 ( ashworth 1980 ) that later became a subject of debate when the star could not be found in the sky ( herschel 1798 ; baily 1835 ) .",
    "cassiopeia a was re - discovered in 1943 at 160 mhz by reber ( 1944 ) , although a re - analysis of a day - long strip chart recording published by jansky ( 1935 ) suggests that he unknowingly detected it as early as 1932 at 20.5 mhz ( sullivan 1978 ) .",
    "accurate measurements of cassiopeia a s flux density - both absolute measurements and measurements relative to the flux density of the extragalactic radio source cygnus a - began in 1949 at 81.5 mhz ( ryle & elsmore 1951 ) .",
    "hgbom & shakeshaft ( 1961 ) , with ryle & elsmore s ( 1951 ) 1949 measurement and two measurements of their own made in 1956 and 1960 also at 81.5 mhz , first showed that cassiopeia a was fading ; they measured a fading rate of @xmath8 % yr@xmath2 , which was later refined to @xmath9 % yr@xmath2 with the addition of four measurements made between 1966 and 1969 also at 81.5 mhz ( scott , shakeshaft , & smith 1969 ) .",
    "using data spanning 1957  1972 , baars & hartsuijker ( 1972 ) measured significantly lower fading rates at 1420 and 3000 mhz , @xmath10 and @xmath11 % yr@xmath2 , respectively ; they first suggested that cassiopeia a was fading at different rates at different frequencies . by 1977 ,",
    "accurate fading rates had been determined at six different frequencies , spanning 81.5 to 9400 mhz .",
    "baars et al .",
    "( 1977 ; see also dent , aller , & olsen 1974 ) collected these measurements , which we re - list in table 1 and plot in figure 1 , and determined the following empirical equation that describes the frequency dependence of cassiopeia a s fading rate for the @xmath5 1965 epoch : @xmath12 using this equation and absolute measurements of cassiopeia a s flux density made around 1965 over a frequency range that spans 22 mhz to 31 ghz , baars et al .",
    "( 1977 ) also determined an empirical equation that describes the absolute spectrum of cassiopeia a for the 1965 epoch to an accuracy of @xmath13% .",
    "empirical equations that describe the absolute spectra of cygnus a and taurus a , and a semi - absolute spectrum for virgo a , were also determined .",
    "equation ( 1 ) was first challenged by erickson & perley ( 1975 ) who s 1974 measurement of the flux density of cassiopeia a at 38 mhz was brighter than the prediction of baars et al .",
    "( 1977 ) at the 3.5 @xmath14 level .",
    "subsequent measurements at 38 mhz by read ( 1977a , b ) , walczowski & smith ( 1985 ) , rees ( 1990 ) , and vinyajkin ( 1997 ) confirmed that the fading rate had decreased from @xmath15 % yr@xmath2 ( determined using only the 1955  1966 measurements ; read 1977a ) to @xmath16 % yr@xmath2 ( determined using all of the measurements through 1995 ; vinyajkin 1997 ) .",
    "% yr@xmath2 , particularly if one ignored the 1949  1969 measurements of ryle & elsmore ( 1951 ) , hgbom & shakeshaft ( 1961 ) , and scott , shakeshaft , & smith ( 1969 ) , which imply a significantly higher fading rate , @xmath17 % yr@xmath2 , at the nearby frequency of 81.5 mhz .",
    "however , rees ( 1990 ) did not rule out the possibility of a changing fading rate at 38 mhz , and indeed , the later measurement of this fading rate by vinyajkin ( 1997 ) suggests that it has changed at the @xmath18 @xmath14 confidence level . ]",
    "similar and more accurate results have been found at 81.5 mhz . as stated above scott , shakeshaft , & smith ( 1969 ) found a 1949  1969 fading rate of @xmath9 % yr@xmath2 at this frequency .",
    "hook , duffett - smith , & shakeshaft ( 1992 ) found a significantly lower fading rate of @xmath19 % yr@xmath2 when they included their 1989 measurement , and a fading rate of @xmath20 % yr@xmath2 when they considered only the measurements made after 1965 .",
    "agafonov ( 1996 ) found similar , although slightly higher values : @xmath21 % yr@xmath2 ( 1949  1985 ) and @xmath22 % yr@xmath2 ( 1973  1985 ) .",
    "consistent measurements have also been made at 102 mhz ( agafonov 1996 ) , 151  152 mhz ( read 1977a ; agafonov 1996 ; vinyajkin 1997 ) , and 290  300 mhz ( baars & hartsuijker 1972 ; vinyajkin 1997 ) .",
    "we plot the low frequency ( 38  300 mhz ) measurements of cassiopeia a s fading rate , as well as the intervals of time over which these measurements were made , in figure 2 , and we list this information in table 2 .",
    "clearly , as is suggested by hook , duffett - smith , & shakeshaft ( 1992 ) , and advocated by agafonov ( 1996 ) , the rate at which cassiopeia a is fading at low frequencies has decreased over the past 50 years .",
    "we find the fading rate to be decreasing by @xmath13 % yr@xmath2 per century at these frequencies .",
    "however , different conclusions have been reached at significantly higher frequencies . osullivan & green ( 1999 ) compare four measurements of cassiopeia a s relative brightness to cygnus a that they made in 1994 and 1995 at 13.5 , 15.5 , and 16.5 ghz to the predictions of baars et al .",
    "the measurements of osullivan & green ( 1999 ) are perfectly consistent with the @xmath23 % yr@xmath2 predictions of equation ( 1 ) , suggesting that the rate at which cassiopeia a fades has not changed significantly over the course of the last half century at these high frequencies .",
    "we plot the high frequency ( 7.8  16.5 ghz ) measurements of cassiopeia a s fading rate in figure 3 , and we list this information in table 3 .",
    "these apparently contradictory behaviors at low and high radio frequencies suggests that the rate at which cassiopeia a fades is changing in a frequency - dependent way : the fading rate is decreasing at the low frequencies ( 38  300 mhz ) and is relatively constant at the high frequencies ( 7.8  16.5 ghz ) . in this paper , we investigate and confirm this trend at the intermediate frequency of 1405 mhz with measurements of the relative flux density of cassiopeia a to cygnus a that we made between 1995 and 1999 with the 40-foot telescope at the national radio astronomy observatory in green bank , wv .",
    "we analyze these measurements in  2 ; we draw conclusions in  3 .",
    "in august of 1995 , 1996 , 1997 , and 1999 , we took drift scans of cassiopeia a and cygnus a using the 40-foot telescope at the national radio astronomy observatory in green bank , wv . in 1995",
    ", we used a 70 mhz band centered about 1405 mhz ; in 1996  1999 , we used a 110 mhz band , also centered about 1405 mhz .",
    "the drift scans were @xmath24 degrees in length , which is @xmath24 times the resolution element of the telescope .",
    "we describe these observations and their analysis in greater detail below . in total",
    ", we measured the relative flux density of cassiopeia a to cygnus a , @xmath25 , five times over a span of five years .",
    "we list these measurements in table 4 . if one models the flux density of cassiopeia a as a constant over this interval of time , we find that @xmath26 for a mean epoch of 1997.4 . this implies a statistical measurement error of @xmath27 % , which is an upper limit since cassiopeia a is in reality fading over this time interval .",
    "since we used only one of two orthogonal linears , we add in quadrature to this statistical error , systematic errors of @xmath28 % and @xmath29 % , corresponding to the polarizations of cassiopeia a and cygnus a , respectively .",
    "this implies a total measurement error of @xmath30 % . conservatively adopting a total measurement error of 1.9 % , a value of @xmath31 jy from the absolute spectrum calibration of cygnus a from baars et al .",
    "( 1977 ) , and a 2 % uncertainty in this calibration , we find that @xmath32 jy for this mean epoch .",
    "prior to the transit of each source , we manually adjusted the declination of the telescope , ensuring , with the aid of a strip chart recorder , that the pointing of the telescope contributed no more than @xmath33 % of error to the flux density measurement . during transit and for the remainder of the observation , we left the telescope at this , its final declination .",
    "afterward , we excised the data from the first half of the observation that we had taken at declinations other than the final declination .",
    "this allowed the background to be reliably modeled and subtracted . across the @xmath24 degree lengths of the observations",
    ", the background appears to be linear , both in the case of the cassiopeia a observations and in the case of the cygnus a observations .",
    "consequently , we modeled the background as linear and subtracted it , simultaneously removing any h i component to the emission .",
    "we estimate that background subtraction contributes @xmath34 % of error to each flux density measurement .",
    "finally , before and after the @xmath35 minute durations of the cassiopeia a observations and the @xmath36 minute durations of the cygnus a observations , we took two - minute - long calibration readings .",
    "each pair of readings agreed to better than @xmath37 % ; none - the - less , we linearly interpolated between the readings , making this a negligible source of error .",
    "consequently and in total , we estimate that the measured flux density ratios , @xmath25 , should be in error by no more than @xmath38 % ; this is consistent with the statistical measurement error of @xmath39 % that we determine above . conservatively adopting total measurement errors of 1.9 % , a 1965 value of @xmath40 from the absolute spectrum calibrations of cassiopeia a and cygnus a from baars et al .",
    "( 1977 ) , and 2 % uncertainties in each of these calibrations , we find a 1965  1999 fading rate of @xmath41 % yr@xmath2 ( @xmath42 for @xmath43 degrees of freedom ) at 1405 mhz .",
    "we plot the 1405 mhz light curve in figure 4 .",
    "we plot the intermediate frequency ( 927  3060 mhz ) measurements of cassiopeia a s fading rate in figure 5 , and we list this information in table 5 . when compared to measurements of the fading rate between 1957 and 1976 , our measurement at 1405 mhz , in conjunction with a recent measurement at the nearby frequency of 927 mhz by vinyajkin ( 1997 ) , show that the fading rate is decreasing at a rate that is intermediate to the rates measured at the lower ( 38  300 mhz ) and the higher ( 7.8  16.5 ghz ) frequencies .",
    "we find the fading rate to be decreasing by @xmath37 % yr@xmath2 per century at these intermediate frequencies .",
    "furthermore , we find that around 1990 , cassiopeia a was fading at about the same rate , @xmath3 % yr@xmath2 , at all of these frequencies . the next decade of observations should reveal whether the fading rate will continue to decrease at the lower frequencies , or whether cassiopeia a will now fade at a relatively constant rate at all of these frequencies .",
