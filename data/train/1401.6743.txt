    "coherent transport in a mesoscopic kondo system has been attracting wide interest since the discovery of the kondo effect in a quantum dot single - electron transistor ( qdset )  @xcite .",
    "observations of tunneling conductance for the qdset  @xcite and other kondo - involved mesoscopic systems , such as a quantum point contact ( qpc )  @xcite and magnetized atom adsorbed on an insulating layer covering a metallic substrate  @xcite , have been reported .",
    "these tunneling conductances demonstrate novel kondo phenomena observed at steady - state nonequilibrium .",
    "the two - reservoir anderson impurity model under bias is considered a proper microscopic model for describing the above - mentioned mesoscopic kondo systems .",
    "however , the nonlinear line shapes of tunneling conductance of those systems are not clearly explained theoretically .",
    "previous theoretical studies using the real - time renormalization group ( rg ) method  @xcite , the keldysh formalism  @xcite , quantum monte carlo calculations  @xcite , and the scattering - state numerical rg method  @xcite can not explain the line shapes of the tunneling conductance of the above - mentioned systems , especially the two side peaks shown in the qpc and adsorbed magnetized atom .",
    "[ b ]    an unanswered question is then ,  why are these approaches unable to reproduce the nonlinear @xmath0 line shapes , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote current and source - drain bias voltage , respectively ? \" some of those theories are quite rigorous and sophisticated .",
    "nevertheless , all of them commonly give a bias - dependent split kondo peak in their spectral functions . in this study",
    ", we find the reasons for this from the schematic model and the methods used , and we provide an appropriate model and method to explain the experimental tunneling conductances measured by using two - terminal setup .",
    "we first discuss the schematic employed in the previous approaches  @xcite and then discuss their methods .",
    "the previous approaches use the schematic suggested by hershfield  @xcite who adopted infinitely large reservoirs and considered spin scattering by a kondo impurity , which was first studied by nozires  @xcite .",
    "we depict spin - flip scattering , for example , in the conventional single - reservoir kondo system in fig .",
    "1(a ) and in the hershfield model for a two - reservoir kondo system under bias in fig .",
    "the latter model is a simple extension of fig .",
    "1(a ) for two reservoirs .",
    "however , we believe that the coherent region in a realistic two - reservoir mesoscopic kondo system covers parts of both metallic reservoirs as well as the mediating kondo atom , as shown in fig .",
    "a big difference exists between the two models : the left and right kondo singlets in fig .",
    "1(b ) are not entangled , whereas those in fig .",
    "1(c ) are entangled .",
    "in other words , the inter - reservoir coherence is broken in fig .",
    "1(b ) , whereas it is retained in fig .  1(c ) .",
    "the wave function in the region including the left @xmath3 and right @xmath4 kondo clouds in fig .",
    "1(b ) can be written in a separate form , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where the subscript `` @xmath7 '' denotes kondo singlet .",
    "these two wave functions are matched at the mediating kondo atom to study the scattering process .",
    "the scattering - state nrg  @xcite corresponds to this situation . for the entangled kondo singlet ( eks )",
    "depicted in fig .",
    "1(c ) , the wave function may be written as @xmath8 with phase parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this type of wave function has been used by feynman  @xcite to study the josephson junction  @xcite .",
    "he showed that the phase difference induces a coherent supercurrent at zero bias ( known as the dc josephson effect ) .",
    "even though the two - level model of feynman is too simple to apply to the eks tunneling in the mesoscopic kondo system , it is clear that the phase difference between two kondo clouds in the mesoscopic kondo system may play a similar role as it does in the josephson junction . in the following ,",
    "we show a characteristic phenomenon of entangled system in which the kondo peak of the eks state at equilibrium has an extra spectral weight owing to inter - reservoir coherence in addition to the spectral weight of the non - eks state , and this extra contribution suddenly vanishes when a bias is applied .",
    "one expects that a phenomenon similar to the dc josephson effect could be observed in an entangled kondo system if contact resistance is removed .",
    "such a system is a mesoscopic metal ring with a gap in which a kondo impurity is located . as a concluding remark , the essence in fig .",
    "1(c ) is phase difference reflecting inter - reservoir coherence as far as wave function is concerned .",
    "the previous studies  @xcite are based on the keldysh formalism  @xcite and the hershfield density matrix .",
    "however , the keldysh formalism suffers from a fundamental difficulty because the phase factors are not explicitly developed on the keldysh contour , and it requires a perturbation scheme based on the state in the remote past at which the system does not have inter - reservoir coherence . in the real - time rg calculation",
    "@xcite avoiding perturbation , one traces out the degrees of freedom of the reservoirs .",
    "this process also breaks inter - reservoir coherence .",
    "also , the hershfield density matrix does not reach the ensemble of eks states by a time - evolution operation from the remote past . instead , one reaches a non - eks state on the keldysh contour and the time - evolution brings to the ensemble of non - eks states , in which inter - reservoir coherence is broken . in summary ,",
    "the various methods used in the previous studies are consistent within the hershfield model of fig .",
    "1(b ) , and they are valid for studying the tunneling of non - eks . as a result , the previous studies produce similar types of spectral functions exhibiting the bias - dependent split kondo peak observed in a three - terminal experiment  @xcite , in which the probing terminal plays the role of phase - breaking scatterer and detects the incoherent current  @xcite .",
    "the real mesoscopic kondo system depicted in fig .",
    "1(c ) requires study of eks tunneling to explain the @xmath0 line shapes measured by using a two - terminal setup .",
    "we emphasize the effect of inter - reservoir coherence in understanding the experimental data correctly .",
    "the problem is how to retain the inter - reservoir coherence in a theoretical analysis or to identify what kind of theoretical formalism it makes possible .",
    "one possible way is to obtain the green s function of the resolvent operator form , @xmath11 in terms of a complete set of basis vectors of the two - reservoir anderson impurity model , @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 indicate the electron spin , kinetic energy , energy level of the mediating atom , hybridization strength , on - site coulomb repulsion , and chemical potential , respectively . in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) ,",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are the identity and liouville operators , respectively .",
    "the liouville operator is defined by @xmath23 for an operator @xmath24 and the inner product is defined by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the adjoint of @xmath27 and the angular brackets denote the expectation value .",
    "we perform only the operator calculations to represent the inner products .",
    "we do not obtain the expectation values and leave them as free parameters , thus avoiding the difficulty in determining a correct nonequilibrium density matrix .",
    "using a complete set of basis vectors guarantees a description of the inter - reservoir coherence .",
    "a complete set of basis vectors spanning the liouville space of the two - reservoir anderson impurity model has been obtained in our previous study  @xcite .",
    "those basis vectors describing up - spin dynamics are divided into three groups : + i : @xmath28 , + ii : @xmath29 , and + iii : @xmath30 , where @xmath31 denotes the liouville operator using @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "the basis vectors in groups i and ii describe the mediating kondo atom , whereas those in group iii describe the reservoirs , and they are used to represent self - energy .",
    "we construct a working liouville space by eliminating unimportant basis vectors .",
    "we neglect multiple spin - exchanging processes because they rarely occur in the kondo regime  @xcite and are less likely to occur under bias .",
    "hence , we eliminate group ii . we construct self - energy using the virtual processes",
    "only and the basis vectors @xmath35 in group iii are neglected .",
    "we further neglect the basis vector @xmath36 in group i because it considers double occupancy up to @xmath37 order by @xmath38 and we study the large-@xmath19 regime .",
    "it is noteworthy that this reduction in degrees of freedom does not affect retention of inter - reservoir coherence .",
    "after reduction of the number of degrees of freedom , the working liouville space is spanned by @xmath39 where @xmath40 represent the quantum states of the reservoirs .",
    "we use @xmath41 indicating @xmath42 to achieve orthogonality among the basis vectors . for convenience",
    ", we omit the normalization factors @xmath43 and @xmath44 in the denominators of the corresponding basis vectors .    in the schematic shown in fig .",
    "1(c ) , the eks tunnels unidirectionally and the electron always passes through the mediating kondo atom .",
    "therefore , the local density of states ( ldos ) at the mediating site  @xmath45 \" , i.e. , the spectral function @xmath46 , contains fundamental information . in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , the ldos is written as @xmath47_{mm}$ ] , where the matrix elements of @xmath48 are given by @xmath49 .",
    "arranging the basis vectors of the working liouville space in the order written above allows the matrix @xmath48 to be written as @xmath50 the block @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) is composed of two infinite - dimensional diagonal blocks with elements @xmath53 that are constructed by the basis vectors @xmath54 and @xmath55 describing the left ( right ) reservoir ; @xmath56 is a @xmath57 block constructed of five basis vectors at the center describing the mediating kondo atom . in contrast , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are @xmath60 and @xmath61 blocks , respectively",

    "all the blocks around @xmath73 are transformed to the self - energy matrix below and the central block @xmath73 is given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 denotes the average number of down - spin electrons occupying the mediating atom .",
    "the inter - reservoir coherence is contained in the matrix elements representing the left - right overlap , such as @xmath77 in @xmath62 and @xmath78 and @xmath79 in @xmath56 .",
    "the latter two are written as @xmath80 and @xmath81 , where @xmath82  @xcite .",
    "we omit the normalization factors and set @xmath83 in @xmath84 .",
    "note that @xmath85 indicates double hopping to go from one reservoir to another and that @xmath78 and @xmath79 represent inter - reservoir coherence .",
    "figure  2 shows the operator dynamics of @xmath78 and @xmath79 depicting a singlet hopping passing through the mediating site . the negative sign in the middle of fig .",
    "2 indicates that @xmath79 represents the effect of bias and vanishes at equilibrium .",
    "in contrast , the unidirectional motion of eks tunneling under bias requires the equality @xmath86 , which is the condition of steady - state nonequilibrium .",
    "however , @xmath87\\rangle$ ] represents the degree of kondo coupling on the left ( right ) side of the mediating kondo atom and @xmath88 represents the degrees of double occupancy coming from the left or right reservoir via the incoherent motion represented by @xmath89 or @xmath90 .",
    "[ b ]    the infinite - dimensional matrix @xmath91 in equation ( [ eq4 ] ) can be transformed into a finite - dimensional matrix via matrix reduction  @xcite , giving @xmath92  @xcite .",
    "the last two terms form the self - energy matrix whose elements are given by @xmath93 $ ] , where @xmath94 denotes the self - energy of @xmath95 for a flat wide band .",
    "we use @xmath96 as an energy unit .",
    "the matrix reduction process corresponds to tracing out the reservoir degrees of freedom .",
    "however , the inter - reservoir coherence contained in the reservoir degrees of freedom remains in the coefficients @xmath97 that appear at the @xmath98 corner blocks , e.g. @xmath99 .",
    "the complete expressions for @xmath97 are given in ref .",
    "finally , the spectral function at the mediating atom is written as @xmath100_{33},\\ ] ] where @xmath101 is represented by the matrix @xmath73 with the addition of self - energy @xmath102 in each matrix element except @xmath103 .",
    "then , the matrix @xmath101 consists of two @xmath104 blocks representing each single - reservoir kondo system  @xcite .",
    "they share the central element representing the mediating kondo atom .",
    "two @xmath98 blocks at the corners of @xmath101 establish the entanglement between two reservoirs .",

    "interestingly , equation ( [ z0 ] ) gives @xmath113 under bias ( @xmath86 ) .",
