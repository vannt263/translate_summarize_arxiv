    "one of the fundamental questions of quantum chaos and mesoscopic physics is the relation between the classical motion and the energy levels of the quantum counterpart of the system@xcite .",
    "correlation of energy levels in chaotic systems in the semiclassical limit ( @xmath13 ) are expected to coincide with those in gaussian random matrix ensembles ( rme ) with different symmetries ( goe , gue etc . ) , while generic integrable systems are characterized by poissonian level statistics@xcite .",
    "recently significant progress has been made concerning the applicability of rme for disordered and chaotic systems@xcite .",
    "in disordered systems the two point correlation function has been expressed in terms of the spectral determinant of the diffusion equation .",
    "these results have been derived with supersymmetric techniques .",
    "it has been suggested that this result can be generalized to chaotic systems@xcite , where the spectral determinant of the perron - frobenius operator plays a similar role .",
    "similar results have been derived with the help of semiclassical gutzwiller type periodic orbit expressions@xcite .",
    "this approach relies heavily on the so - called diagonal approximation for @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is of the order of the heisenberg time ( see below ) , in order to , in an ingenious way , make statements about @xmath16 .",
    "the suggested results of @xcite then follows after some further approximations .",
    "one of the conclusions of these studies is that deviations from rme behavior is expected only when the chaotic mixing is slow and the characteristic time of mixing @xmath17 is comparable with the heisenberg time . in a usual system",
    "the mixing time @xmath17 is a classical quantity characterizing the decay of classical correlation functions and as such it is of order @xmath18 .",
    "the heisenberg time is the uncertainty time @xmath19 corresponding to the mean level spacing ( @xmath20 ) . in the semiclassical limit",
    "@xmath13 the mean level spacing behaves like @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the dimension of the system and the heisenberg time gets much larger than the mixing time .",
    "slow mixing can be expected if we perturb an integrable system with a small point like object , whose classical size can be neglected . in this case",
    "the only source of mixing is the quantum mechanical diffraction of waves on the small object .",
    "the diffraction constant governing the speed of the mixing is proportional with @xmath23 and the resulting mixing time is proportional with @xmath24 . in a two dimensional system the level spacing is also proportional with @xmath23 and the ratio of the mixing time and the heisenberg time remains fixed in the semiclassical limit @xmath13 .",
    "this gives the possibility to study systems , where corrections to rme remain finite . in this paper",
    "we study the sinai billiard with a small scatterer , which , as we show here , is a strongly diffractive system and its level statistics deviates strongly from the rme result .",
    "we are considering the standard sinai billiard , a unit square with a reflective circular disk in the middle .",
    "we then develop the periodic orbit description of the sinai billiard with small scatterer based on the diffractive extension@xcite of the gutzwiller trace formula .",
    "this is done in sections 2 and 3.1 .",
    "the diffractive determinant we derive from the trace formula is directly related to the kkr determinant of berry , which is discussed in section 3.2 .",
    "we will study a straightforward generalization of berry s method to the @xmath2 subspace , which exhibit some very interesting features , even in the diffractive or small radius limit . in section 4",
    "we study the level statistics exhibited by the zeroes of the diffractive determinant for various values of the parameter @xmath25 .",
    "we then change from a square to a suitably chosen rectangle shape , in order to avoid the non generic degeneracies of the square billiard .",
    "in this section we review the main steps of the derivation of the diffractive trace formula and spectral determinant introduced in ref.@xcite .",
    "the emphasis is on point - like diffractive sources with no angular dependence in their associated diffraction constants .",
    "these point sources are placed inside a bounded and otherwise non diffractive system .      for the description of diffraction effects in the semiclassical limit ( @xmath13 ) keller@xcite",
    "introduced the _ geometric theory of diffraction _",
    "( gtd ) . according to this theory ,",
    "the energy domain green function can be divided into a geometric ( @xmath26 ) and a diffractive ( @xmath27 ) part : @xmath28 where the geometric part is the semiclassical green function .",
    "the semiclassical green function is a sum for all classical trajectories ( @xmath29 ) with energy @xmath30 connecting the starting point @xmath31 and the end point @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the van vleck - gutzwiller green function .",
    "it can be calculated from the action @xmath35 calculated along trajectory @xmath29 @xmath36 where the amplitude @xmath37 is the van vleck - gutzwiller determinant @xcite multiplied with the maslov phase .",
    "the diffractive part of the semiclassical green function @xmath38 describes the effect of wave scattering on points @xmath39 being singular points of the classical dynamics@xcite .",
    "it is a sum over all possible trajectories which start from @xmath31 , go to one of the singular points @xmath39 , then leave the singular point and reach the end point @xmath32 ; or go and visit any combination of singular points before reaching the end point .",
    "a trajectory going trough one singularity contributes to the green function with@xcite @xmath40 the generalization to multi scattered trajectories is straightforward , and will be developed in the next section . in eq ( [ eqn : onescatt ] ) , @xmath29 and @xmath41 are indices of the incoming and the outgoing classical trajectory , @xmath42 is the diffraction constant associated with the singularity located at @xmath39 .",
    "it depends on the direction of incoming and outgoing momenta @xmath43 and @xmath44 and energy @xmath30 .",
    "the diffraction constant is the leading part of the exact quantum mechanical scattering amplitude of the singularity .",
    "based on the expression for the green functions in the previous subsection we can derive the diffractive version of the gutzwiller trace formula@xcite .    the trace of the total green function is a sum of its geometric and diffractive parts : @xmath45 where the geometric part @xmath46 is just the usual gutzwiller trace formula , a sum over unstable periodic orbits possibly amended by a sum over neutral orbits and the contribution from zero length orbits is in @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath48 is essentially the green function @xmath49 without the singular contribution coming from the zero length orbit .",
    "we concentrate here on the new term @xmath50    to be more specific , we assume that the diffraction is caused by the presence of @xmath51 small disks located at @xmath39 , where @xmath52 , whose diffraction constants @xmath53 do not depend on the scattering angle@xcite .",
    "this will simplify the formulation considerably .",
    "we can easily see that the contribution to the green function from all orbits via the disks @xmath54 and @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 the generalization to multi scattered trajectories is now obvious .",
    "we can introduce a symbolic dynamics by simply labeling the disks by the corresponding indices @xmath58 . in an open n - disk system",
    "a periodic disk sequence @xmath59 codes the single periodic orbit visiting the disks in the prescribed order . in a bounded system",
    "it denotes _ all _ such periodic orbits e.g. the transition @xmath60 denotes all ( topologically distinct ) ways to go from disk @xmath61 to disk @xmath62 . in the following",
    "we will refer to _ periodic symbol codes _ and _ symbolic periodic orbits _ to avoid confusion with periodic orbits .    the calculation of the trace of the green function @xmath38 amounts to add up contributions from all _ distinct _ paths from @xmath31 to @xmath32 via @xmath63 disk scatterings and then taking the trace .",
    "the basic building block @xmath64 in semiclassical approximation is a sum over all paths from ( see ( [ eqn : pathsum ] ) ) .",

    "the contribution from the symbolic path @xmath66 to the trace is @xmath67 the integral over @xmath31 can be performed in the @xmath13 limit by using the saddle point method .",
    "the result is @xmath68 @xmath69 the stationary phase conditions select out all points @xmath31 lying on a trajectory between disk @xmath70 and @xmath54 , that is , it selects periodic orbits .    to get the full contribution from the symbolic periodic orbit @xmath71 one must add the contribution from all _ nonidentical _ cyclic permutations of the sequence @xmath72 in eqs .",

    "the length of the code @xmath43 is denoted @xmath75 .",
    "instead of restricting ourself to all non identical permutations we can take all cyclic permutations and then divide by @xmath76 .",
    "the result of this somewhat laborious exercise in combinatorics can be conveniently expressed in terms of the derivative of the quantity @xmath77 as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the set of all primitive periodic symbol sequences taken from the alphabet @xmath80 where @xmath51 is the number of singular points in the system .",
    "we now introduce the spectral determinant @xmath81 , defined through the logarithmic derivative @xmath82 since the green function is a sum ( see eq.[sm ] ) , the spectral determinant naturally factorizes as a product @xmath83 where @xmath84 is associated with zero length orbits and corresponds to the mean level density , @xmath85 is the gutzwiller - voros zeta function associated with classical periodic orbits , possibly amended by neutral orbits . the diffractive determinant ( or zeta function ) now reads @xmath86",
    "in this section we work out the diffractive spectral determinant of the sinai billiard in the small disk limit .",

    "the billiard contains only a single disk and the symbolic dynamics introduced in the previous section has only a single letter implying the existence of one single primitive periodic code , and the resulting determinant is trivial @xmath89    the geometry of the sinai billiard is easy to visualize if one unfolds it into a quadratic lattice of disks .",
    "a trajectory from the diffractive object ( i.e. the small disk ) and back to itself is characterized by a lattice vector @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 can take any integer value .",
    "the geometric green function @xmath49 may be expressed as a sum over lattice vectors @xmath93 with the zero length vector @xmath94 excluded .",
    "the green function @xmath95 may be expressed in terms of ( the semiclassical limit of ) a free green function @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a phase index associated with the reflection on the square wall .",
    "but in order to improve the approximation we use the exact free green function in two dimensions @xmath98 the resulting expression is @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the momentum in dimensionless units @xmath101 .",
    "the sum for the lattice vectors is the exact green function of the empty square with the zero length term removed .",
    "the green function can also be expressed via the eigenfunctions of the empty square .",
    "the wave functions can be categorized according to the different irreducible representations of @xmath102 .",
    "there are four one dimensional ( @xmath2 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 ) representations and one two dimensional ( @xmath30 ) . the disk is centered at the point where all the symmetry lines meet .",
    "wave functions of the empty square billiard vanish at this point except for the @xmath2 subspace .",
    "accordingly , only the energies belonging to this subspace are affected by diffraction in leading semiclassical order as will be demonstrated later .",
    "the full quantum sinai billiard problem can be solved with the kkr method introduced in this context by berry in ref.@xcite , where the @xmath103 subspace has been worked out in detail .",
    "the method leads to a determinant @xmath106 whose zeroes yield the eigenvalues of the problem .",
    "the generalization to other subspaces are fairly straightforward . here , without repeating the derivation of ref.@xcite , we quote the relevant results for the @xmath2 and @xmath103 subspaces and show that the periodic orbit expression ( [ eqn : zcyc ] ) is essentially the leading part of the kkr determinant .    the effective dimension of the kkr matrix is @xmath107 . for @xmath108 , which we call the diffractive zone , it is essentially one dimensional .",

    "the kkr determinant , and thus the diffractive spectral determinant , exhibit poles at the unperturbed eigenvalues @xmath122 .",
    "they cancel the zeroes of the geometric determinant @xmath123 according to the formula @xmath124 and give rise to corrected eigenvalues given by the zeroes of @xmath125 .",
    "this is an important property of diffractive zeta functions : they cancel the geometric zeros and create new ones .",
    "note that there is no contribution coming from isolated unstable orbits in our system , @xmath126 is just the berry - tabor sum for the square billiard @xcite .",
    "the investigation of the kkr determinant for all symmetry subspaces is not a superfluous exercise .",
    "next we show that the @xmath2 subspace will exhibit some very interesting features , to which we devote the rest of the paper .",
    "the quantum eigenvalues in the diffractive limit can be determined from the equation @xmath127 or euivalently from the real equation @xmath128 where @xmath129      when @xmath130 is large one can use perturbation theory to compute the roots of eq .",

    "1 illustrates how well this expression works for @xmath136 , where we have plotted the distance from an eigenvalue of the sinai billiard ( @xmath136 ) and the nearest eigenvalue of the square billiard .",
    "the expression above applies only to non - degenerate states . for a @xmath137-degenerate unperturbed energy ,",
    "@xmath138 levels remain almost unaffected , which is clearly seen on fig",
    ".    there are two regions in the range @xmath139 where perturbation theory should work in principle .",
    "the first is the limit @xmath87 .",
    "taking well known asymptotic expressions@xcite for the bessel functions one gets @xmath140 where @xmath141 is euler s constant .",
    "however , this expression goes very slowly to zero as @xmath87 and unless the radius is very small perturbation theory does not even apply to the ground state @xmath142 .",
    "the second is where @xmath130 has a pole within the diffractive zone @xmath108 , namely at @xmath143 .",
    "close to this value , the perturbation expression works very well , as it can be seen on the scatter plot fig .",
    "1 . note , that the index of the levels is now shifted one step up relative to the unperturbed ones , this is why we chose to plot the nearest distance to an unperturbed eigenvalue .",
    "we note that @xmath130 exhibit a zero at @xmath144 so the perturbation theory also breaks down deep inside the diffractive zone .    as a comparison , in the @xmath103 subspace",
    "the perturbation is on average@xcite @xmath145 perturbation theory works well almost throughout the whole diffractive region . so the spectrum in the @xmath103 representation , in the diffractive zone ,",
    "can hardly be expected to be particularly interesting .    for @xmath2 , on the other hand",
    ", @xmath146 will range from @xmath10 to @xmath147 in the interval @xmath148 which is well inside the diffractive zone .",
    "in this section we solve eq .",
    "( [ eqn : s0c ] ) numerically and study the statistics of levels .",
    "the essential parameter of the problem is @xmath25 since the mean level spacing @xmath149 does not depend on energy @xmath131 . here",
    "we will study spectra for fixed values of @xmath130 .",
    "the idea of keeping @xmath7 and thus @xmath25 fixed needs some explanation .",
    "if we decrease @xmath0 and keep @xmath25 fixed by increasing @xmath58 , more and more levels are squeezed in a neighborhood of some @xmath150 .",
    "we then can safely replace @xmath25 by @xmath151 and it is possible to obtain a sufficiently large number of levels around @xmath152 for which the value of @xmath7 is approximately constant and given by @xmath153 . for obvious reasons we calculate the bottom part of the spectrum .",
    "however , this sample should exhibit the same statistics as any comparable sequence of levels , e.g. around @xmath152 .",
    "the reason is that the location of a level depends on the parameter @xmath25 and the location of the unperturbed levels in the environment and the statistics of these unperturbed levels is well defined and given by a poissonian process .    in the actual calculation we made a minor modification of the conventional sinai billiard , since the empty square billiard has degeneracies in its spectrum .",
    "their origin is number theoretical and is connected with the high degree of symmetry in the system .",
    "if a disk is present , these degeneracies are split by higher order terms in the kkr determinant . within the scope of the present diffractive determinant",
    "they remain there . in the following we want to avoid this complication and replace the square by a rectangle with sides @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "the function @xmath133 is modified accordingly @xmath156)}{e-\\mbox{v}^2}-e_i(q)/\\pi,\\ ] ] where @xmath157 is now the dual lattice of the rectangle .",
    "we investigate three statistical measures on the spectra .",
    "first we will investigate the integrated probability distribution of neighboring levels @xmath158 where @xmath149 is the mean level spacing around the energy @xmath131 and @xmath159 is the step function .",
    "then we investigate the two point correlation function of levels @xmath160 @xmath161 where the average is taken for a large number of energies .",
    "we also compute its fourier transform , the form factor , @xmath162 the correlation function and the form factor are computed over a gaussian window centered at the middle of the sample spectrum , its width is about one sixth of the sample size . the results are then smeared with another gaussian .",
    "we choose the width of this gaussian rather small so some ( non significant ) oscillations due to finite statistics will remain in the plots .    in fig .",
    "2 we show results for @xmath9 , with 5000 levels computed .",
    "the level spacing curve ( fig 2a ) is close to the prediction of the random matrix theory ( goe ) , with a small but significant deviation .",
    "an exact agreement is hardly possible because the levels are locked between the unperturbed levels@xcite .",
    "the close agreement with goe is in this perspective rather surprising .",
    "the formfactor @xmath163 is plotted in fig 2b .",
    "there is again good agreement with goe except for small @xmath164 .",
    "the bump for small values of @xmath164 indeed persist rather high up in the spectrum ( of the full kkr determinant ) and is quite similar to the behavior predicted in @xcite .",
    "the correlation function @xmath165 is plotted in fig .",
    "the deviation from goe is now most pronounced around @xmath166 .    in fig .",
    "3 we show the correlation function @xmath165 for a geometric sequence of @xmath7 s , each spectrum contains 1500 levels .",
    "we note how it , in a uniform way , interpolates between a poissonian result and the goe - like .",
    "the kkr determinant may be recast into a periodic orbit expressions in the limit @xmath167 @xcite .",
    "periodic orbit calculations are very laborious in this limit , it is questionable whether it provides a useful method of extracting ( many ) eigenvalues for bound chaotic systems@xcite .",
    "what motivated us in this paper , is that the kkr determinant yields ( diffractive ) periodic orbit expressions also in the limit @xmath87 .",
    "this diffractive limit is very feasible form a periodic orbit point of view .",
    "a traditional symbolic dynamics for the sinai billiard uses the lattice vectors @xmath168 as symbols @xcite . in the diffractive limit , this symbolic dynamics is complete .",
    "the reason for this is the absence of shadow behind disks in the @xmath87 limit .",
    "moreover , the diffraction constant is independent of the scattering angle . in the language of cycle expansions@xcite , these circumstances imply that the cycle expansion ( [ eqn : zcyc ] ) is entirely given by the ( well defined ) fundamental part , the curvature correction vanish identically .",
    "so , what we have presented here is a very straight forward application of the cycle expansion technique as well as of the geometric theory of diffraction . yet , the results are non - trivial .",
    "even if we have not used the diffractive determinant for computations as it stands ( [ eqn : zcyc ] ) we have demonstrated that study of spectral statistics is in principle approachable for periodic orbit theories in this case .",
    "a natural extension of this work is to increase the number of small scatterers and study whether goe emerges as the number of scatterers tends to infinity and are distributed randomly , preliminary results indicate that this is indeed the result @xcite .",
