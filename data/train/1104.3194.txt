    "the discovery of black hole entropy and hawking radiation in 1970s bekenstein:1973ur implies a profound connection between gravitation and thermodynamics .",
    "almost twenty years ago , jacobson @xcite proposed to interpret this connection by reversing the logic and deriving the einstein s equations from a thermodynamic equation of state with two assumptions : proportionality of entropy and area for all local rindler horizons , and the clausius relation .",
    "the first assumption is nothing but the expression of the holographic principle @xcite@xcite . in 1998 , maldacena gave a gorgeous conjecture , namely the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , which is a direct manifestation of the holographic principle .",
    "it was suggested that gravitation is induced by a quantum field theory in lower dimensions which to a large extent support the idea of gravitation on the macroscopic scale as a manifestation of the thermodynamics of the vacuum state .",
    "furthermore , more confidence about gravity being emergent rather than fundamental was recently inspired in verlinde:2010hp@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "jacobson treated @xmath0 theory as non - equilibrium thermodynamics of spacetime , therefore , an entropy production term is required to keep the entropy balance relation .",
    "the term is an outcome of the non - vanishing expansion at @xmath1 which is related to a local boost dependence quantity . in 2008 ,",
    "elizalde and silva @xcite proposed an alternative approach , with local thermodynamic equilibrium maintained , using the idea of local - boost - invarianceintroduced in @xcite .",
    "in other words , local boost dependence quantity is erased under the boost - invariant truncation , so expansion at @xmath1 vanishes , without any entropy production term when we repeat jacobson s derivation .",
    "brustein and hadad @xcite showed that the equations of motion of generalized theories of gravity are equivalent to the thermodynamics relation @xmath2 .",
    "their proof relies on extending previous arguments by using a more general definition , namely noether charge entropy .    in this paper , we focus on the origin and feature of the entropy production . we show that it is a consequence of the @xmath3 ambiguity in an approximate boost killing vector field .",
    "if we suspend this ambiguity first , the entropy production will vanish , and vice versa . in order to research the thermodynamics of different gravity models",
    ", we assume the validity of those gravity field equations , and then use them to derive the form of entropy . in @xmath0 gravity , if the boost variant(a lie derivative of @xmath0 along killing vector at a point @xmath1 in the spacetime ) is nonzero , the entropy production is a function of the boost variantand non - vanishing expansion at @xmath1 .",
    "in pure general relativity ( gr ) , we can not adopt such approach . the shear term from raychauduri equation",
    "can include the entropy production .",
    "@xmath0 theory can also accept the shear term , instead of non - vanishing expansion term , as the entropy production term .",
    "at last , we may find that the shear term being the entropy production term is more general .",
    "conditions of pure gr and @xmath0 theory analyzed , we believe our method and results can also be generalized to other gravity theories .",
    "in this section , we review jacobson s work briefly and set the background of our work .",
    "first , we can describe spacetime in a vicinity of a free - falling local observer @xmath1 as flat through the equivalence principle .",
    "then , we choose a local 2-surface element @xmath4 including @xmath1 and perpendicular to the worldline of @xmath1 .",
    "the boundary of the past of @xmath4 is defined as `` local rindler horizon '' [ horizon entropy ] , whose generators are a congruence of null geodesics with vanishing expansion and shear",
    ". therefore , the local rindler horizon reaches equilibrium at @xmath1 .",
    "considering the local rindler horizon is actually a causal horizon , we can introduce an entropy @xmath5 , measuring the degrees of freedom beyond it . according to the holographic principle , @xmath5 is proportionate to the area elements of the horizon .",
    "the definition of the heat flux and temperature is related to an approximate boost killing vector field @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath6 generating boosts orthogonal to @xmath4 the causal horizon .",
    "it vanishes at @xmath1 , its flow invariant at the tangent plane @xmath7 .",
    "its covariant derivative @xmath8 is a timelike antisymmetric tensor orthogonal to @xmath7 .",
    "we normalize @xmath6 by @xmath9 . in a common curved spacetime ,",
    "no killing vectors exist .",
    "we can only solve the killing equation @xmath10 with this `` initial data '' out to some order in the neighborhood of @xmath1 .",
    "the equation @xmath11is equal to the killing equation . in riemann",
    "normal coordinates @xmath12 based at @xmath1 , the zeroth and the first order parts of @xmath6 are resolved by initial conditions , while the second order part vanishes according to the killing s equation ( compare both sides of eq.[eq1 ] to get this conclusion ) .",
    "generally , the equation can not be satisfied at third order , so we still have a @xmath3 ambiguity in killing vector @xmath6 , which would influence the integrability of equation [ eq1](refer to weinberg s text book @xcite for detail ) .",
    "we choose the direction of @xmath6 to be future pointing on the causal horizon .",
    "in flat spacetime , @xmath13 can be defined as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the horizon tangent vector and @xmath16 is a negative affine parameter that is increasing along the horizon and vanishes at @xmath1 . here",
    ", we set light - cone coordinates as @xmath17 which satisfy @xmath18with the third order ambiguity in curved spacetime , @xmath6 should be @xmath19and therefore eq.[eq1 ] becomes @xmath20    after defining the local rindler horizon and approximate killing vectors , it is natural to define the heat .",
    "the heat is the mean flux of the boost energy current across the horizon measured by a uniformly accelerated observer hovering inside the horizon : @xmath21@xmath22 is the expectation value of the matter stress tensor , and @xmath23 is the area of each cross section element of @xmath24 .",
    "the integration is over a short pencil of horizon generators of @xmath24 , and @xmath16 contained in @xmath6 represents the evolution of those generators .",
    "since it is an equilibrium state at @xmath1 , the metric and , further , its conjugate @xmath22 are also approximately stable .",
    "it means the expectation value of the matter stress tensor do not change over a sufficiently small @xmath16 or , equivalently , quantum transitions terminate . without loss of generality , we choose @xmath25 .    according to the unruh effect and rindler coordinates",
    ", we know acceleration tends to diverge as observer approaches the horizon .",
    "since both of the temperature and heat flux are proportional to the acceleration , they diverge the same rate .",
    "thus , we can choose the acceleration to be unit and the temperature measured by the observer to be @xmath26 .",
    "in jacobson s paper , he reversed the logic , using two hypotheses , universal entropy density of the horizon and the clausius relation in vicinity of @xmath4 , to derive the einstein equation .",
    "some gravity theories , like @xmath0 gravity , may need an entropy production rate to keep the entropy balance relation .",
    "however , we wonder that the entropy may contain un - physical quantities which will cause the entropy production . in @xcitebrustein:2009hy ,",
    "wald entropy was introduced immediately , so the un - physical quantities were truncated .    in this section ,",
    "we postulate the @xmath0 gravity field equation first , and then ascertain the form of entropy affecting the dynamics . considering the killing equation and approximate killing vector field , we will find the entropy production rate arising from the ambiguity term .",
    "the equation of motion of @xmath0 is @xmath27 put it into the heat , it follows that @xmath28 for simplicity , we leave the ambiguity term @xmath3 of eq.[eq1 ] alone and pick it up afterward .",
    "terms with @xmath29 vanish since @xmath29 contracted with @xmath30 leads to @xmath31 in light - cone coordinates .",
    "we then evaluate the equation at the leading terms in @xmath16 , @xmath32the killing equation shows @xmath33 is antisymmetric , so we can use stoke s theorem and obtain @xmath34here comes a contradiction that the integrand contain @xmath16 at beginning , while the first term at the last step do not .",
    "in other words , @xmath35 has a term of less order @xmath36 it seems that @xmath37 should be zero by comparing the two sides s order of eq.[eq9 ] , therefore @xmath38 in another way . in jacobson s paper ,",
    "the entropy change is @xmath39 , where @xmath40 .",
    "it can be extracted as @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the boost variantwhich mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the raychaudhuri equation is @xmath43the shear term is required to be zero at @xmath1 .",
    "comparing these equations , we will obtain the entropy production term @xmath44 however , the entropy production term is supposed to vanish at @xmath1 , the equilibrium point , so the rate should be of order @xmath16 .",
    "it requires @xmath45 and @xmath46    @xmath47    this equation is directly related to the equation of motion of @xmath48    now , if we use @xmath49 in eq.[eq7 ] , then the integrand will have @xmath50 @xmath51 which has the same order with other terms .",
    "@xmath52 consist of two parts : one is from eq.[4 ] , the other is from using the stokes theorem .",
    "the ambiguity term @xmath50 act as @xmath53 which also vanishes at @xmath1 and is irrelevant to the equation of motion . substituting @xmath54 parallel with the entropy production density derived by jacobson .",
    "one thing need attention is we only use @xmath55 in this part , not each of these two terms to be zero .",
    "it means that they are not related to the the equation of motion .",
    "latexmath:[$\\dot{f}%    depandant on the choice of coordinates and so is @xmath37 which is restricted by @xmath57 hence , we find the entropy production is related to boost .",
    "in this section , we discuss the situation of pure gr under a similar procedure . replace the equation of motion of @xmath0 with einstein equation @xmath58 we immediately get @xmath59here @xmath60 is demanded for the reason that both sides of the equation should have the same order . without @xmath61 we can get the state equation of equilibrium positively . however , if we consider ambiguity term , we can not formulate the entropy production term since expansion at @xmath1 vanishies .",
    "however , in raychaudhuri equation ( eq.[eq11 ] ) there is a shear term @xmath62 .",
    "if the shear term is not required to be zero , it can be used to describe the entropy production term such as @xmath63 .",
    "this is coincident with jacobson s remarks .",
    "actually , entropy production term comprising latexmath:[$\\theta    limited by latexmath:[$\\dot{f}%    nonzero shear like in pure gr , we will also keep @xmath60 .",
    "it may , from another aspect , give the reason why the thermodynamic relation @xmath2 hold in generalized theories of gravity .",
    "these two situations analyzed above indicate that the entropy production term comes from the ambiguity term of the approximate killing vector . we do need it for the entropy balance relation rather than the field equation . from this point of view , we find the entropy production term is not related to the equation of motion",
    ". this ambiguity term can also be constructed of nonvanishing @xmath65 or other quantities .",
    "it can be seen that our method is universal , therefore we make the conclusion that entropy production term is caused by the ambiguity term of the approximate killing vector field .",
    "furthermore , we believe that the entropy production term can also be described by nonvanishing @xmath65 , since raychaudhuri equation is used generally on null geodesics distortion caused by gravity .",
