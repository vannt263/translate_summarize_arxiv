    "it is widely believed that the fundamental theory of strong interaction is quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , which in principle can be applied to describe most of nuclear physics . however , due to the property of confinement and asymptotic freedom , qcd can not yet be used to study low - energy nuclear physics .",
    "the challenge to nuclear physicists is to find models which can bridge the gap between the fundamental theory and our wealth of knowledge about low energy phenomenology .",
    "some of these models have been proved to be successful in reproducing different properties of hadrons , nuclear matter and quark matter @xcite .",
    "the quark mass density - dependent model ( qmdd ) is one of such candidates .",
    "the qmdd model was first suggested by fowler , raha and weiner @xcite , and then employed by many authors to study the stability and physical properties of strange quark matter @xcite .",
    "this model provides an alternative phenomenological description of quark confinement because in this model , the mass of quarks is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the vacuum energy density and @xmath7 . @xmath8",
    "represent the number density of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 quarks respectively .",
    "we see from eqs.([mass_ud ] ) , ( [ mass_s ] ) , if the distance between quarks goes to infinity , the volume of the system becomes infinite , @xmath11 approaches to zero and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) approaches to infinite .",
    "this is just the confinement condition as that of mit bag model @xcite .",
    "however , qmdd model has its advantage since the boundary condition put by hand in mit model to confine quarks is abandoned .",
    "this correspondence was confirmed by benvenuto and lugones @xcite .",
    "they proved that the properties of strange matter in the qmdd model are nearly the same as those obtained in the mit bag model .",
    "although the qmdd model can provide a dynamical description of confinement and explain the stability and many other dynamical properties of strange quark matter ( sqm ) at zero temperature , there are many difficulties when we extend this model to finite temperature .",
    "they are : 1 ) it can not mimic the correct `` temperature @xmath14 vs. density @xmath15 '' deconfinement phase diagram of qcd because the quark masses are divergent and then @xmath14 tends to infinite when @xmath16 @xcite ; 2 ) although the basic improvement of qmdd model is the quark masses depending on density and the quark confinement mechanism mimics , it is still an ideal quark gas model with no quark - quark interaction included .",
    "however , as was shown in recent rhic experiments , the quark - quark interaction can not be neglected in quark - gluon plasma . in order to overcome the first difficulty , a quark mass density- and temperature dependent ( qmdtd ) model @xcite is proposed and it was argued that @xmath6 is a function of temperature as that of friedberg - lee ( fl ) model @xcite .",
    "the equation of state of qmdtd model are used to study the properties of strange quark star in refs.@xcite@xcite and the results are successful .",
    "to the second difficulty , as a first step , ref.@xcite has introduced a coupling between quark and non - linear scalar field to improve the qmdd model and have investigated the properties of nucleon successfully .",
    "instead of the correspondence of mit bag to qmdd model , a fl soliton bag is formed by quark and scalar field coupling for improved qmdd ( iqmdd ) model and the quark deconfinement phase transition can take place .",
    "this paper evolves from an attempt to extend the iqmdd model @xcite to finite temperature .",
    "since the spontaneously broken symmetry of the scalar field will be restored at finite temperature , the non - topological soliton tends to disappear when temperature @xmath14 increases to @xmath17 .",
    "if the temperature increases further , the solution becomes a damping oscillation and such a solution can not be taken as `` soliton '' solution , so the quarks are to be deconfined .    by using the finite temperature field theory",
    ", we will calculate the effective potential under one - loop approximation and find @xmath18 .",
    "studying the temperature dependence of soliton solutions is our first motivation .",
    "our second motivation is to find the function @xmath0 . in qmdtd model",
    ", @xmath0 is an input . as an ansatz ,",
    "two formulae @xmath19,\\quad 0 \\le t \\le t_c\\ ] ] with @xmath20 adjustable parameters , and @xmath21 , \\quad 0 \\le t \\le t_c\\ ] ] were introduced in ref.@xcite and ref.@xcite respectively . however , for fl model or for the iqmdd model , @xmath0 can be calculated because the vacuum energy density @xmath6 equals the difference of the value of the effective potential between the vacua inside and outside the soliton bag , and the vacua of the effective potential depend on temperature .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the following section we review the iqmdd model and its numerical solutions for our selected parameters . in sec.iii , we give detailed calculation of the effective potential of the iqmdd model and the bag constant as functions of temperature .",
    "the soltion solutions of the iqmdd model at different temperatures are presented in sec.iv , while in the last section we present our summary and discussion .",
    "since the details of iqmdd model can be found in ref.@xcite , hereafter we only write down the essential formulae which are necessary for our further discussion .",
    "the effective lagrangian density of the iqmdd model is @xcite @xmath22 which describes the interaction of the spin-@xmath23 quark fields @xmath24 and the phenomenological scalar field @xmath25 with the coupling constant @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath12 is the mass of u(d ) quark , which is given by eq.([mass_ud ] ) . in this paper",
    "we do not discuss the strange quark .",
    "the potential for the @xmath25 field is chosen as @xmath27 @xmath28 the condition ( [ e7 ] ) ensures that the absolute minimum of @xmath29 is at @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath29 has two minima : one is the absolute minimum at a large value of the @xmath25 field @xmath31^{\\frac 1 2}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath32 , another is at @xmath33 .",
    "the former corresponds to the physical or nonperturbative vacuum , and @xmath34 representing some condensates .",
    "the other represents a metastable vacuum where the condensates vanishes , with an energy density @xmath6 relative to the physical vacuum .",
    "the `` bag constant '' @xmath6 can be expressed as @xmath35    from eq.([lagrangian ] ) , the classical euler - lagrangian equations can be obtained as @xmath36 in the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) , the scalar field @xmath25 is taken as time - independent classical c - number field , and we only consider a fixed occupation number of valence quarks ( 3 quarks for nucleons , and quark - antiquark pair for mesons )",
    ". quantum fluctuation of the bosons and effects of the quark dirac sea are thus to be neglected . in the following",
    ", we will discuss the ground state solution of the system .    in the spherical case , the @xmath25 is spherically symmetric , and valence quarks are in the lowest s - wave level .",
    "then the scalar field @xmath25 and the dirac equation functions can be written as @xmath37 where the quark dirac spinors have the form @xmath38 by using eqs.([euler - eq1])-([spinor ] ) , we obtain @xmath39 the quark functions should satisfy the normalisation condition @xmath40 the number of quarks would be @xmath41 for baryons and @xmath42 for mesons . in the following discussions , we only constrain in the case @xmath41 .",
    "these equations are subject to the boundary conditions which follow from the requirement of finite energy : @xmath43    if we consider @xmath44 quarks in the lowest mode with energy @xmath45 , the total energy of the system is @xmath46dr.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this model has four adjustable parameter @xmath47 which can be chosen to fit various baryon properties such as the proton change radius @xmath48 , the proton magnetic moment @xmath49 and the ratio of axial - vector to vector coupling @xmath50 . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "a wide rage of parameters has been used to calculate above quantities .",
    "hereafter we take one set of parameters @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 to study the temperature dependence of the soliton solution .",
    "it has been proven in ref.@xcite that this set of parameters can describe the properties of nucleon at zero temperature successfully .     the @xmath25 and quark fields in arbitrary unit as functions of r for the parameters taken as @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . ]",
    "the quark density @xmath55 in arbitrary unit as functions of r for the parameters taken as @xmath56 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . ]    in fig.[fig : fig1 ] we plot the @xmath25 and quark fields profiles in arbitrary unit as functions of r for the above parameters .",
    "the quark density @xmath55 distribution versus radius are plotted in fig.[fig : fig2 ] .",
    "the appropriate framework for studying phase transitions is finite temperature field theory or thermal field theory . within this framework",
    "the finite temperature effective potential is an important and useful theoretical tool .",
    "the idea of such techniques could trace back to the 1970 s when kirzhnits and linde first proposed that symmetries broken at zero temperature could be restored at finite temperature@xcite@xcite .",
    "subsequently weinberg@xcite , dolan and jackiw @xciteas well as many others have adopted the effective potential as the basic tool to study the symmetry - breaking phase transitions . in this section",
    "we briefly outline the relevant results of dolan and jackiw@xcite , since the iqmdd model is very similar to the model studied by those authors .",
    "the effective potential can be calculated to one - loop order by using the methods of dolan and jackiw@xcite .",
    "but it is pointed out in ref@xcite that , as an approximation , all @xmath25 quantum loop diagrams may be ignored due to the fact that @xmath25 is only a phenomenological field describing the long - range collective effects of qcd , its short - wave components do not exist in reality .",
    "therefore for the rest of this discussion we shall ignore quantum corrections and concentrate on those induced by finite temperature effects .",
    "then the one - loop contribution to the effective potential is of the form @xmath57 where @xmath29 is the classical potential of the lagrangian . @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the finite temperature contributions from boson and fermion one - loop diagrams respectively@xcite@xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out that , in this approximate method for the calculation of the effective potential , the plane wave quark states have been used , while , in fact , the quarks are confined in the finite - size solitonic configuration .",
    "therefore , this approximate method is not fully self - consistent . for simplicity ,",
    "we have substituted @xmath60 for @xmath61 . these contribute the following terms in the potential@xcite @xmath62 @xmath63 where the minus sign is the consequence of fermi - dirac statistics . @xmath64 and @xmath12 are the effective masses of the scalar field @xmath25 and the quark field , respectively : @xmath65 we fix @xmath66 by taking its value at the physical vacuum state@xcite . in this work , @xmath0 is defined as the difference between the vacua of the effective potential inside and outside the solion bag .",
    "this means that for @xmath67 , @xmath0 is the difference between the effective potential values at the perturbative vacuum state and values at the physical vacuum state @xmath68 for @xmath69 , @xmath4 due the fact that the vacua inside and outside the soliton bag are equal .",
    "this will be analyzed in more details in next section .",
    "the temperature - dependence of the one - loop effective potential @xmath70 . at low temperature",
    ", there are two minima and one of which is going to disappear when the temperature reaching a high temperature @xmath71 .",
    "the critical temperatures is set at @xmath1 when two minima are euqal . ]    from eqs.([potential0 ] ) , ( [ massq ] ) and ( [ masss ] ) , we can numerically solve the effective potential @xmath70 for different temperatures . in fig.[fig",
    ": fig3 ] , we plot the one - loop effective potential @xmath70 as a function of @xmath25 at @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 . it can be seen from fig.[fig : fig3 ] that there exist two particular temperatures .",
    "one is that the effective potential exhibits two degenerate minima at @xmath1 which is defined as critical temperature , the other is that the second minimum of the potential at @xmath77 disappears at a higher temperature @xmath78 .    for low temperatures",
    "the absolute minimum of @xmath70 lies close to @xmath79 , and there is another minimum at @xmath80 .",
    "the physical vacuum state at @xmath79 is stable and correspondingly quarks are in confinement .",
    "as the temperature increases the second minimum of the potential at @xmath80 decreases relative to the first one . at the critical temperature @xmath81 , the potentials at the two minima are equal .",
    "the physical vacuum becomes unstable .",
    "since @xmath4 when @xmath14 is lager than @xmath17 , there is no bag constant to provide the dynamical mechanism to confine the quarks in the bag .",
    "moreover , there is no soliton - like solution in the model when the temperature is above @xmath82 due to the effective potential and vacuum structure , there only exists the damping oscillation solution and such a solution can not produce a mechanism to confine the quarks in a small region , we will investigate the damping oscillation in next section more detail .",

    "@xmath83 decreases smoothly with increasing temperature , while @xmath0 and @xmath84 decrease dramatically with increasing temperature when the temperature is around @xmath90 . from eq.([e3 ] ) , we can give the parameters @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "soliton models such as those described in section ii can be modified so as to allow for the effect of thermal background with temperature @xmath93 , just by replacing the relevant classical potential function @xmath29 by an appropriately modified temperature - dependent effective potential @xmath70@xcite@xcite .",
    "for finite temperature soliton solutions will take the same form as the one at zero temperature .",
    "but the equation of motion for the @xmath25 field should be replaced as @xmath94 where the temperature - dependent effective potential @xmath70 is defined in eq.([potential0 ] ) . and",
    "the quark functions should also satisfy the normalisation condition @xmath95    the functions @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 also satisfy the boundary conditions following from the requirement of finite energy : @xmath99 however , the situation is changed for @xmath96 as @xmath100 .",
    "when @xmath67 , in order to satisfy the requirement of finite energy of the solition ( or other topological defects ) , as @xmath101 , @xmath96 should be equal to @xmath79 , where the potential @xmath102 has an absolute minimum .",
    "for example , at zero temperature , we take the asymptotic value ( vacuum values ) @xmath103 as @xmath101 , while for finite temperature , @xmath104 as @xmath100 , because @xmath79 is a temperature - dependent function , and of course , @xmath105 has an absolute minimum . for @xmath106 ,",
    "the physical vacuum becomes unstable , and the stable vacuum is the perturbative vacuum which is the absolute minimum of the effective potential .",
    "therefore , to satisfy the requirement of finite energy of the solition at @xmath106 , we should take the asymptotic value ( vacuum values ) @xmath107 as @xmath101 .",
    "based on above analysis , one obtain the following boundary condition for the function @xmath96 as @xmath101 : @xmath108     the soliton solutions for different temperatures when @xmath67 . ]",

    "similarly to the discussions of ref.@xcite , where they predicted that the radius of a stable strangelet increases as temperature increases , we can give an exact variation of radius as functions of temperature in fig.[fig : fig8 ] , which reveals that the radius of the soliton bag does increase with increasing temperature .",

    "the soliton solutions tend to disappear . from fig.[fig : fig5 ] we can see that , unlike the conventional soliton solutions ploted in fig.[fig : fig4 ] , here the solutions have the damping oscillation , and we can not find soliton solution anymore .    for investigating the stability of solion at different temperatures ,",
    "it is necessary to calculate the total energy of the system at various temperatures by using eq.([energy ] ) , accordingly the relevant classical potential function @xmath29 should be replaced by the temperature - dependent effective potential @xmath119 . in fig.[fig : fig9 ] , we plot the total energy of the system ( soliton mass or energy ) as functions of temperature for @xmath120 , where@xmath116 is the soltion energy at zero temperature .",
    "it can be seen that the total energy of system will decrease as the temperature increases .",
    "when the temperature is around the critical temperature @xmath17 , the total energy of the system will dramatically decrease to 74% of @xmath116 .",
    "since there is no soltion solution when @xmath121 , the soltion mass ( or energy ) for @xmath121 does not exist .",
    "however , from the fig.[fig : fig5 ] and eq.([energy ] ) , we can find that the total energy of system is almost equal to the quark field energy , this also implies that the soltion bag is melted out and has disappeared when the temperature is above the critical temperature @xmath82 . since there is no soliton bag",
    "when the temperature is above the critical temperature @xmath82 , there is no mean - square charge radius for the proton for @xmath121 .",
    "as mentioned in sect.iii , @xmath0 is defined as the difference between the vacua inside and outside the solion bag . for @xmath122 ,",
    "the vacuum inside the soliton bag is the metastable vacuum , the vacuum outside the soliton bag is the real physical vacuum .",
    "this can be seen in fig.[fig : fig4 ] .",
    "as the temperature is above the critical temperature @xmath17 , the metastable vacuum becomes the absolute one .",
    "it can be seen from fig.[fig : fig5 ] , the behavior of @xmath96 changes dramatically when @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath96 is very close to zero at any @xmath123 .",
    "therefore , the values of the effective potential are always close to its stable minimum at @xmath124 .",
    "the state at @xmath125 can never be realized in this case .",
    "this means that the bag constant @xmath126 .",
    "based on above analysis , there is no soliton solution and the bag constant @xmath0 is zero for @xmath3 , so there exists no more mechanism in soliton bag model to confine the quarks , and the quark is to be decofined when @xmath121 .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the deconfinement phase transition of the iqmdd model at finite temperature and obtained the effective potential of the iqmdd model at different temperatures .",
    "we also have gotten the function @xmath0 and fitted the analytical formula of the bag constant .",
    "it is shown that the two minima of the potential at zero temperature will be equal at a certain temperature @xmath1 .",
    "when the temperature @xmath3 , the original perturbative vacuum state becomes stable and the original physical vacuum state becomes a metastable one . because @xmath96 is very close to zero at any @xmath123 for @xmath3 , the effective potential takes always its value at the absolute minimum @xmath127 .",
    "this gives @xmath4 for @xmath3 .",
    "as the temperature approaches another higher temperature @xmath128 , the effective potential has a unique minimum .",

    "the soltion bag disappears .    like the conventional soltion bag model",
