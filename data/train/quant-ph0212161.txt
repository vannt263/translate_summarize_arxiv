    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) is a way to share between the sender , alice , and the receiver , bob , a secret key whose information is not known to the eavesdropper , eve .",
    "since the first qkd protocol , called bb84 protocol , was introduced by bennett and brassard @xcite , several schemes for qkd have been proposed , such as ekert protocol @xcite , which is based on the nonlocality of quantum mechanics , b92 protocol @xcite , which uses two nonorthogonal states , and so on @xcite . in each protocol , since eve can not eavesdrop without disturbing quantum states , she will induce some errors or changes in the transmission rate . in ideal situations where imperfections such as transmission losses and dark counting of detectors do not exist",
    ", one can prove that the qkd protocols are secure even when eve employs any kind of eavesdropping strategies including so - called collective attack or coherent attack , which is the most general attack where a single probe is entangled to the whole transmitted pulses . in practice , however , imperfections exist and if eve gets rid of imperfections by using her unlimited technology ( for example , she may replace the noisy channel to a noiseless channel ) , eve can disturb quantum states to a certain degree and therefore she obtains some information about the secret key .",
    "estimation of the amount of information extracted by eve and construction of a secure secret key under such situations are not a trivial problem .",
    "there are several works which deal with the security of realistic qkd . in @xcite",
    ", it is proven that under some conditions the bb84 protocol is secure even when eve employs coherent attack .",
    "the security proof in @xcite reveals a tight connection to the entanglement purification protocol @xcite and quantum error correcting codes , especially calderbank - shor - steane codes @xcite .",
    "this proof can be also applied to bb84-type protocols such as the 6-state protocol @xcite where the basis information is exchanged over a public channel .",
    "the security against the individual attack , which is more restricted but more realistic , was also discussed for the bb84 protocol @xcite and for the ekert protocol @xcite .    on the other hand , we have not yet fully understood the security of the b92 protocol .",
    "the discussions so far concerned with the security against individual attack @xcite . in each paper , the single - photon polarization is used as a carrier of the quantum signals , and the transmission loss is not included . in @xcite ,",
    "fuchs and peres have calculated the upper bound of eve s shannon information gain averaged over all transmitted bits .",
    "slutsky and co - authers have estimated the upper bound of eve s renyi information gain in a b92 protocol as a function of the error rate when alice and bob discard errors @xcite .",
    "the b92 protocol , which uses only two states , is conceptually the simplest of all the protocols .",
    "in addition , the protocol includes a continuous parameter ( the nonorthogonality between the two states ) that can be chosen by the users , forming a striking contrast to the bb84-type protocols .",
    "further understanding of the security of the b92 protocol is thus important not only for the practical applications but also for deeper understanding of the nature of quantum information .    in this paper",
    ", we estimate the security of the b92 protocol against individual attack over a realistic channel including noises and transmission losses .",
    "we assume , like in @xcite , that alice encodes the bit values in two single - photon polarization states ( the original b92 in @xcite uses two nonorthogonal coherent states ) .",
    "we consider a modified protocol in which inconclusive measurement results are also used for the estimation of eve s information gain , in addition to the bit error rate used in the previous analyses .",
    "the problem is also regarded as one of the basic problems of quantum eavesdropping , namely , the maximum information leak to an adversary who are simulating the noisy quantum channel through which alice transmits bob a bit encoded on two quantum states .",
    "we briefly describe how alice and bob can obtain the secret key whose information available to eve is negligibly small .",
    "first , alice prepares nonorthogonal single- photon polarization states @xmath0 and @xmath1 , depending on the bit values of the raw key , and sends them to bob . after propagating through the noisy channel or through eavesdropping by eve",
    ", @xmath0 and @xmath1 generally become mixed states , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "secondly , bob performs measurement whose outcomes are 0 , 1 and `` ? '' .",
    "the outcome `` ? '' means an inconclusive result where bob can not determine which state alice has sent .",
    "thirdly , alice and bob discard inconclusive bits and they reconcile the errors in conclusive bits by an error correction protocol which is the technique of classical information theory to obtain the reconciled key . finally , in order to eliminate eve s information about the reconciled key , alice and bob shorten their keys via a privacy amplification protocol @xcite , which is also the technique of the classical information theory .",
    "how much they should shorten the reconciled key depends on how much information about the reconciled key eve could have obtained .",
    "the last two procedures are done over a public channel .",
    "it is assumed that eve can listen to the information exchanged over the public channel , but she can not alter it . by means of these techniques ,",
    "alice and bob can obtain the identical secret key , even under the imperfections and eve s interference .    in the above framework , it is important for alice and bob to estimate eve s information about the reconciled key properly . to estimate this information ,",
    "we propose a slightly modified protocol .",
    "the difference between our protocol and the original protocol is that when bob obtains an inconclusive result , alice opens which state she has sent . using this extra data",
    ", bob performs data processing which is a kind of symmetrization of the states received by bob .",
    "this makes our analysis simpler without underestimating eve s ability . we can estimate eve s information by using the symmetrized density matrices .",
    "eve s information gain is calculated as a function of a few parameters which characterize the symmetrized density matrices . since bob s symmetrized density matrices can be fully characterized by the observed quantities and classical communication , the problem we have solved is equivalent to the problem of how much maximum information eve can extract while she simulates the noisy channel .",
    "the answer to this problem has turned out to be more complex than expected ; we found a counter - intuitive phenomenon where the maximum information gain is not monotone increasing as a function of the amount of noises when the angle between alice s two states is small .",
    "we also found that for a small noise rate , eve can extract perfect information in the case where the angle of alice s two states is very small or very large , while she can not extract perfect information for the intermediate angle .",
    "we give an explanation that is useful to understand these behavior intuitively .",
    "we also performed an optimization of the angle between alice s two states that makes the rate of the final key gain as high as possible .",
    "we show that the optimized angle decreases as the amount of noises and the transmission losses increase .",
    "unfortunately , the assumption of the polarization encoding makes the b92 protocol particularly weak against channel losses , so that the key gain is always smaller than in the bb84 protocol .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : as ] , we describe our assumption on the apparatus used by alice and bob , and the limitation on eve s strategy .",

    "[ summary ] is devoted to the summary and discussion .",
    "in this section , we describe the assumptions on the abilities of the legitimate users ( alice and bob ) and the eavesdropper ( eve ) .",
    "we put these conditions throughout this paper .",
    "first , we describe what alice and bob perform with ideal apparatus . the b92 protocol is originally considered to use two nonorthogonal coherent states . in this paper , however , we assume two nonorthogonal single - photon polarization states for the simplicity of analysis . we denote the hilbert space for each pulse as @xmath4 , which contains arbitrary photon number states , and the subspace that contains only one photon as @xmath5 .",
    "the subspace @xmath5 is two - dimensional reflecting the polarization degree of freedom , and the states in @xmath5 are conveniently represented by the bloch sphere .",
    "we define @xmath6 and @xmath7 for @xmath8 as follows , @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the eigenstates of @xmath12 ( @xmath13 component of pauli matrix ) whose eigenvalues are @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "@xmath16 is the angle between @xmath17 and @xmath18 on the @xmath19 plane in the bloch sphere .",
    "we assume that alice prepares the following states depending on the bit value , @xmath20 where the parameter @xmath21 characterizes the nonorthogonality between the two states , such that @xmath22 when these states are sent to bob through the noisy quantum channel , @xmath0 and @xmath1 generally become mixed states , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . on these states , bob measures the polarization on the basis @xmath23 or @xmath24 , which is selected randomly .",
    "the whole measurement process is described by the following povm @xcite @xmath25 where `` v '' means the states which contain zero or more than one photon , where allowances are made for the effect of transmission losses . @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( @xmath28 )",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] schematically using bloch sphere . here",
    "we allow general cases where @xmath29 is not necessarily equal to @xmath21 .",
    "we call the events inconclusive where bob s outcome of the measurement is @xmath30 or @xmath31 , and the events where bob s outcome is @xmath32 or @xmath33 conclusive .     ]    in reality , the transmission line and alice and bob s apparatus is not perfect ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we assume one condition on the character of the imperfection , namely , the imperfection is equivalently represented as a noise source placed just after alice s ideal apparatus , and a noise source just before bob s ideal apparatus . under this condition ,",
    "[ fig2 ] becomes fig .",
    "we need some care for this assumption .",
    "for example , if the noisy photon detectors pd1 and pd2 in fig",
    ".  [ fig2 ] have different quantum efficiencies , we can not transform this model into fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] directly .",
    "however , if bob interchanges noisy pd 1 and noisy pd 2 at random , which effectively makes the efficiency of these detectors identical , we can transform fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] into fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , and the assumption can be met .",
    "the benefit of the above assumption is that we can use a simpler model in which alice and bob s apparatus is perfect , in the following sense . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the region bounded by dash - dotted lines is under eve s",
    "suppose that this region is extended up to the dotted lines .",
    "while this assumption may make the length of the final key shorter than the optimum one , at least we can avoid the risk of underestimating eve s ability . in this model ,",
    "every imperfection is attributed to the property of the quantum channel , and the analysis is considerably simplified .",
    "this assumption has been also used in the previous works @xcite .",
    ".[fig2 ] ]    ]    we assume that eve s eavesdropping is restricted to individual attack .",
    "the definition of individual attack is that eavesdropping is independently done for each pulse and there exists no correlation of events among pulses . in the most general individual attack",
    ", eve prepares her auxiliary system ( probe ) e in an initial state @xmath34 , interacts it with one pulse sent by alice via a unitary operation @xmath35 , and performs measurements on the probe e to obtain the bit information .",
    "we do not impose any restriction on eve s measurement on the probe .",
    "we do not treat more general attack , such as collective attack or coherent attack .",
    "in this section , we propose a protocol slightly modified from the original one , which makes it possible to identify the density matrices of the states received by bob more tightly .",
    "the main idea is that alice and bob can identify the density matrices more precisely by monitoring more parameters . in our protocol ,",
    "alice and bob monitor not only the error rate in conclusive bits , but also the statistics of inconclusive bits .",
    "this additional information makes it possible to identify the density matrices after a symmetrization which is described in sec .",
    "[ sec : sym ] .",
    "our modified protocol consists of the following steps .    1 .",
    "alice determines a bit value @xmath36 or @xmath37 randomly , and sends to bob the single - photon polarization state @xmath38 defined by eq .",
    "( [ alice s choice ] ) .",
    "2 .   bob performs the measurement described by povm @xmath39 defined by eq .",
    "( [ povm ] ) .",
    "if the measurement result was @xmath40 , bob sets the received bit value as @xmath41 , and if @xmath42 , he sets @xmath43 . in both cases",
    ", bob tells alice over the public channel that the result was conclusive , and alice adopts @xmath44 and bob adopts @xmath45 as a bit value of their raw keys , respectively . if the measurement result was @xmath46 or @xmath47 , bob opens the result @xmath48 , and alice opens the bit value @xmath44 in the cases @xmath49 .",
    "alice and bob repeat steps 13 @xmath50 times and obtain their raw keys .",
    "error reconciliation : to make an identical key ( the reconciled key ) from their raw keys , alice and bob perform an error correction protocol .",
    "the reconciled key consists of `` correct bits '' which were found to be correct and `` flipped bits '' which were found to be incorrect and hence flipped in the error correction protocol . in order not to leak the additional information about the final key to eve",
    ", a previously shared secret key is used to encrypt the communication over the public channel . a small length of the secret key is also used to make sure that the reconciled key is identical , using an authentication protocol @xcite .",
    "estimation of eve s information : after the public communication about the inconclusive events in step 3 and the error reconciliation in step 5 , bob knows alice s original bit values for the cases where bob s measurement results were @xmath51 .",
    "he can determine the number of events @xmath52 @xmath53 where alice s choice was @xmath44 and bob s result was @xmath48 .",
    "assuming that @xmath50 is large , @xmath54 gives a good estimate of the quantity @xmath55 .",
    "bob estimates the maximum information that can be leaked to eve under the condition @xmath56 the estimation of eve s information gain is separately made for the correct bits and for the flipped bits . 7 .",
    "privacy amplification : to eliminate the information leaked to eve , alice and bob produce a secure final key by shortening the correct bits and flipped bits of reconciled key according to the information gains estimated in step 6 via a privacy amplification protocol .",
    "the most important part in the quantum key distribution through a noisy channel is the estimation of the leaked information done in step 6 .",
    "the detailed procedures in the proposed protocol above were chosen so as to make the estimation easier .",
    "first , we use not only the error rate in conclusive bits but also the measurement results of inconclusive bits to fix the density operator of the state delivered to bob more tightly .",
    "secondly , the optimization of eve s measurement on her probe system is simplified by estimating eve s information about correct bits and flipped bits independently .",
    "for the correct bits , the state of eve s probe when the bit value of the final key is @xmath30 is a pure state @xmath57 , and the state when the bit value is @xmath31 is @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the constants for normalization .    in our estimation of eve s information gain on each correct bit , we use the information gain @xmath61 defined through the collision probability @xmath62 averaged over possible eve s outcomes @xmath63 . here",
    "@xmath64 is the posteriori probability that alice s bit value is @xmath65 ( the state of eve s probe was @xmath66 ) under the condition that eve has obtained outcome @xmath63 .",
    "the explicit definition of the information gain @xmath61 is @xmath67   \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is the probability that eve obtains outcome @xmath63 .",
    "this measure is useful since it directly tells us how much we should shorten the key in the privacy amplification @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath61 is maximized by the von neumann measurement on the basis symmetrically arranged around the vectors @xmath69 and @xmath70 @xcite , and thus we obtain the maximum information gain for each correct bit @xmath71 which can be written as @xmath72 where @xmath73 note that the same measurement also maximizes the information gain measured with respect to shannon entropy @xcite , and its maximum value @xmath74 is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the entropy function defined as @xmath77 .",
    "the maximum information gain @xmath78 for each flipped bit can be obtained by merely changing the definition of @xmath79 with @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the problem of finding the maxima of @xmath83 and @xmath84 reduces to finding the minimum of @xmath85 or @xmath86 , which will be solved in sec .",
    "[ sec : infogain ] .    in our analysis ,",
    "we assume , for simplicity , an unrealistic assumption that eve can deal correct bits and flipped bits independently , which may overestimate the amount of the leaked information .",
    "if we try to deal these together , we need to optimize eve s measurement in four dimensional hilbert space , and the optimization would be more complicated .",
    "we leave the tight estimation of the leaked information in such cases to future investigations .",
    "we have to be careful about leaked information during the error reconciliation protocol .",
    "the redundant information used in step 5 contains the partial information of the secret key .",
    "so , in order to prevent this leakage of information , redundancy bits are encrypted by previously shared secret key . on the other hand",
    ", since we assume eve employs individual attack , in other words the events for different pulses are independent , the public communication concerned with inconclusive results in step 4 does not leak any information about the conclusive results , and so we need not to encrypt this communication .",
    "in this section , we consider the symmetrization of eve s strategy which simplifies our analysis , but never underestimates eve s ability .",
    "the discussion can be similarly applied to the flipped bits .",
