    "i.e. _ charm or beauty quarks , are sensitive probes of the hot and dense medium created in high energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the production of heavy flavor quark - antiquark pairs proceeds mainly via gluon - gluon fusion in the very early stage of the collision , not only through leading order pair production processes but also via higher order qcd mechanisms involving flavor excitation or gluon splitting diagrams @xcite . while the total yield is sensitive to the initial gluon density @xcite as well as to nuclear effects such as shadowing ,",
    "the phase space distribution of heavy flavor should shed some light on the dominant production mechanisms in inital state hard scattering processes .",
    "in addition , thermal production from gluon - gluon scattering in later stages of the collision might play a role , providing some sensitivity on the initial temperature reached in a nuclear collision .",
    "once being produced , a heavy quark - antiquark pair propagates through the collision zone and forms either a bound quarkonium state or separates and hadronizes into two particles carrying open heavy flavor . in case a deconfined phase of nuclear matter is formed during the collision , the yield of heavy quarkonia might either be reduced due to the expected screening of the qcd attractive potential @xcite or possibly even enhanced due to quark - antiquark coalescence @xcite or statistical recombination @xcite . while open heavy flavor measurements will provide an essential baseline for quarkonia suppression / enhancement studies @xcite , they are of prime interest in their own right as well",
    ". modifications of the gluon distribution function in cold nuclear matter should manifest themselves in differences in the heavy flavor yields and spectra between p - p and p - a collisions .",
    "high @xmath1 hadrons carrying light quarks only are strongly suppressed at central rapidity in au - au collisions at rhic @xcite .",
    "medium induced gluon radiation , which might be the mechanism driving the observed suppression , could be reduced for heavy quarks @xcite .",
    "therefore , a comparison of the spectra of particles carrying heavy flavor , or their decay products , produced in elementary and nuclear collision systems should reveal crucial information regarding the mechanisms responsible for the observed energy loss of hard scattered partons in heavy - ion collisions at rhic .",
    "further insight regarding the interaction of heavy quarks with the nuclear medium can be gained from the measurement of the elliptic flow strength @xmath2 , which addresses the question whether collectivity is bourne out already on the parton level at rhic @xcite .",
    "the direct reconstruction of heavy - flavor decays , _ e.g. _ @xmath3 , is difficult in the high - multiplicity environment of a heavy - ion collision .",
    "an alternative approach is to determine the contributions from semileptonic heavy - flavor decays , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath4 , to single lepton and lepton pair spectra .    at rhic ,",
    "the phenix experiment @xcite is ideally suited for such studies since it is optimized for the measurement of leptons .",
    "electrons are measured in the phenix central arm spectrometers , which cover the pseudorapidity range @xmath5 . at forward and backward pseudorapidity ( @xmath6 )",
    "two dedicated muon spectrometers are available .    up to now , the phenix open heavy - flavor program focuses on the analysis of single electron spectra , @xmath7 , measured at central rapidity .",
    "the momenta of charged particles are determined via tracking through a magnetic field using drift and pad chambers .",
    "electron candidates are identified by associated hits in a ring imaging cerenkov detector ( rich ) passing a ring shape cut , and they are confirmed by an associated shower in an electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) with an energy that is close to the measured momentum .",
    "accidental coincidences between rich hits and hadron tracks lead to a background level of about 10% . employing an event - mixing technique ,",
    "this background is estimated and statistically subtracted from the electron sample .",
    "the sources contributing to the inclusive electron spectra can be grouped into two classes :    * * photonic * electrons originate from dalitz decays of light neutral mesons ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 ) and conversions of photons in material . * * non - photonic * electrons are primarily from semileptonic decays of heavy flavored particles . on the level of a few percent",
    ", dielectron decays of light vector mesons ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath13 ) and weak decays of kaons contribute to the non - photonic electron spectra as well , in particular at low @xmath1 .",
    "the non - photonic electron spectra are constructed by measuring the inclusive electron spectra and then subtracting the photonic contributions .",
    "the photonic electron spectra are determined mainly via two methods :    * for the * cocktail * method the contributions from dalitz ( and dielectron ) decays are calculated with a hadron decay generator @xcite , where the hadron yields and phase space distributions are parameterized according to available data .",
    "the electron spectra from photon conversions are very similar in shape to the corresponding dalitz electron spectra , as confirmed in detailed simulations .",
    "the yield ratio depends on the material in the detector acceptance and is typically in the order of one .",
    "* for the * converter * method a thin photon converter ( 1.7 % @xmath14 brass ) is introduced into the detector acceptance close to the interaction point for a fraction of the running period . by measuring the electron spectra with and without the converter being present in the setup",
    ", the fraction of electrons originating from photonic sources can be inferred @xcite .",
    "these two techniques are complementary to each other .",
    "the converter method allows for a precise measurement of the non - photonic electron spectrum at low @xmath1 ( in particular below 1  gev / c ) , where the ratio of non - photonic to photonic electrons is so small ( @xmath1520% ) that the cocktail method suffers from substantial systematic uncertainties , mainly due to the independent normalization of inclusive electron spectra and the cocktail input .",
    "therefore , the converter method is the tool of choice for the measurement of the total non - photonic electron cross section , since this is dominated by the electron yield at low @xmath1 . towards higher @xmath1 , the ratio of non - photonic to photonic electrons increases rapidly , eliminating the main uncertainty in the cocktail subtraction technique . at the same time",
    ", the converter method suffers from statistics limitations due to the decreasing photonic electron yield with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "hence , for the measurement of the spectral shapes of non - photonic electrons it is beneficial to use the cocktail method .",
    "a third technique is the so - called @xmath16-coincidence technique , which relies on the fact that electrons from photonic sources are accompanied by a photon .",
    "this method can provide a further independent cross check of the photonic electron measurement , but the requirement of registering a photon in coincidence with an electron results in a significantly reduced statistical precision compared with the other two techniques .",

    "it is interesting to note that for @xmath18  gev / c the electron spectrum is harder than expected from pythia calculations of charm and bottom pair production , where the pythia parameters were tuned to existing data from lower energy experiments @xcite .",
    "this might be due to the fragmentation function being harder than implemented in default pythia or it could point to the fact that other production mechanisms beyond leading order gluon - gluon and quark - antiquark fusion play an important role at rhic energies . since in the low @xmath1 region , which dominates the total cross section , the agreement between pythia and the data is quite reasonable , the total charm production cross section was determined by extrapolating with pythia from the measured central rapidity region to the full phase space .",
