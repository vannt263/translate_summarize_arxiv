    "constructive field theory build functions whose taylor expansion is perturbative field theory @xcite . any formal power series being asymptotic to infinitely many smooth functions , perturbative field theory alone does not provide any well defined mathematical recipe to compute to arbitrary accuracy any physical quantity , so in a deep sense it is no theory at all .    in field theory",
    "infinite volume quantities are expressed by connected functions .",
    "one main advantage of perturbative field theory is that connected functions are simply the sum of the connected feynman graphs .",
    "but the expansion diverges because there are too many such graphs .",
    "in fact connectedness does not require the full knowledge of a feynman graph ( with all its loop structure ) but only the ( classical ) notion of a spanning tree in it . to summarize constructive theory ,",
    "let s say that it is all about working as much as possible with the trees only , and resumming or hiding most of the quantum loops .",
    "this is the constructive golden rule :    _  thou shall not know all the loops , or thou shall diverge ! \"",
    "_    however the constructive program launched by a. wightman and pursued by j. glimm , a. jaffe and followers in the 70 s was a partial failure because no natural four dimensional field theory could be identified and fully built .",
    "this is because only non - abelian gauge theories are asymptotically free in the ultraviolet limit .",
    "but ultraviolet asymptotic freedom also means infrared slavery , and non - perturbative long range effects such as quark confinement are not fully understood until now , even at a non - rigorous level .",
    "the constructive program went on , but mostly as a set of rigorous techniques applied to many different areas of mathematical physics @xcite .",
    "recently quantum field theory on non - commutative space has been shown renormalizable .",
    "the simplest such theory is the @xmath1 theory on the moyal space , hereafter called @xmath0 .",
    "grosse and wulkenhaar @xcite overcame the main obstacle to renormalizability , namely the ultraviolet / infrared mixing , through the use of a new symmetry called langmann - szabo duality @xcite .",
    "following their initial breakthrough , a flurry of papers has appeared to extend this result to other models and to generalize to the moyal context many useful tools and techniques of ordinary perturbative field theory . for recent reviews ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "it now appears that four dimensional non commutative field theories are _",
    "better _ behaved than their commutative counterparts .",
    "in particular @xmath2 , in contrast to its commutative counterpart , is _ asymptotically safe _ @xcite : the flow between the bare and the renormalized coupling constant is bounded .",
    "in fact the graphs responsible for the flow of the coupling constant compensate exactly at any order with those responsible for the wave function renormalization .",
    "this is an exciting discovery : ls symmetry may play a role similar to supersymmetry in taming ultraviolet flows .",
    "asymptotic safeness is in a sense much simpler than asymptotic freedom , and @xmath2 now stands out as an obvious candidate for a four dimensional constructive field theory without unnatural cutoffs ( although on the unexpected moyal space ) .    but",
    "after @xcite one main difficulty remained unsolved on the road to constructive @xmath2 .",
    "current cluster expansions used in standard bosonic constructive theory @xcite are unsuited to treat matrix models with large number of components . to explain why ,",
    "let us compare the large @xmath3 vector @xmath4 model and the large @xmath3 matrix@xcite @xmath4 model . in both cases the coupling scales as @xmath5 for a non trivial limit as @xmath3 gets large",
    ": at order @xmath6 in a graph there is indeed in both cases at most about @xmath6 loops of indices .",
    "but in the first case the field has @xmath3 vector components , and at a given vertex only two different colors can meet . knowing only a spanning tree in the graph , it is still possible to sum over all indices at the right cost . to do this , at any leaf of the tree one can sum over the index which does not go towards the root and keep the other one for the next step .",
    "iterating from leaves of the tree towards the root there is only one index summed per vertex , ( except at the root , where in the case of a vacuum graph there are two indices to sum , leading to the final global @xmath3 factor of vacuum graphs ) .",
    "this procedure does not violate the constructive golden rule , as no loops need to be known .",
    "but a matrix model is very different .",
    "the field has @xmath7 components and at a given vertex four different indices meet .",
    "the scaling of the vertex is still only @xmath5 , but this is because each propagator identifies _ two _ matrix field indices with two others , rather than one .",
    "therefore matrix models apparently clash with the constructive golden rule .",
    "the knowledge of the full loop structure of the graph , not only of a tree , seemed until now necessary to recover the correct power counting , for instance a single global @xmath7 factor for vacuum graphs .",
    "since @xmath0 is a quasi - matrix model with a large number of components in the ultraviolet limit @xcite it is plagued with this constructive matrix difficulty , hence seems unsuited at first sight for a constructive analysis .",
    "the difficulty persists in the direct space version @xcite of the model , but in a different guise . in that representation , it is the non - locality of the vertex in @xmath8 space which is impossible to treat with standard constructive methods , such as ordinary cluster and mayer expansions with respect to lattices of cubes .    in short a new kind of expansion based on a new idea is required for constructive @xmath0 .",
    "this is what we provide in this paper .",
    "the idea is in fact quite simple .",
    "matrix models can be decomposed with respect to an intermediate matrix field .",
    "integrating over the initial field leads in a standard way to a perfect gas of so called _ loop vertices _ for this intermediate field .",
    "one can then perform the tree expansion directly on these loop vertices .",
    "all indices loops then appear as the correct number of traces of products of interpolated resolvents , which can be bounded because of the anti - hermitian character of the intermediate field insertions .",
    "we take as an example the construction of the connected functions of a matrix model perturbed by a @xmath9 interaction .",
    "we prove as a typical result borel summability in @xmath10 of the normalization and of the connected @xmath11 point functions _ uniformly in the size of the matrix_. smaller and smaller as @xmath12 is trivial and would completely miss the difficulty . ]    in a companion paper @xcite we explore the consequences of this idea in the more traditional context of commutative constructive field theory .",
    "recall that it is possible to rearrange fermionic perturbation theory in a convergent expansion _",
    "order by order _ by grouping together pieces of feynman graphs which share a common tree @xcite . but bosonic constructive theory can not be simply rearranged in such a convergent way _ order by order _",
    ", because all graphs at a given order have the same sign . resummation of the perturbation theory ( which occurs only e.g. in the borel sense ) must take place between infinite families of graphs ( or subparts of graphs ) of different orders . to explicitly identify these families",
    "seemed until now almost impossible .",
    "cluster and mayer expansions perform this task but in a very complicated and indirect way , through an intermediate discretization of space into a lattice of cubes which seems _ ad hoc _ for what is after all a rotation invariant problem .",
    "in fact the cluster expansion between loop vertices , although found in the context of matrix models , can identify such families also in the ordinary commutative case @xcite .",
    "this simplifies traditional bosonic constructive theory , avoiding any need for cluster and mayer expansions .",
    "we should bring in this way bosonic constructions almost to the same level of simplicity than the fermionic ones and explore the consequences in future publications .",
    "the simplest @xmath4 matrix model is a gaussian independent identically distributed measure on @xmath3 by @xmath3 real or complex matrices perturbed by a positive @xmath9 interaction .",
    "the @xmath12 limit is given by planar graphs .",
    "it can be studied through various methods such as orthogonal polynomials @xcite , supersymmetric saddle point analysis @xcite and so on .",
    "however none of these methods seems exactly suited to constructive results such as theorem [ borelunif ] below .",
    "consider the complex case ( the real case being similar ) .",
    "the normalized interacting measure is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the normalized gaussian measure with covariance @xmath15    for the moment assume the coupling @xmath10 to be real positive and small .",
    "we decompose the @xmath16 functional integral according to an intermediate hermitian field @xmath17 acting either on the right or on the left index .",
    "for instance the normalization @xmath18 can be written as : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the standard gaussian measure on an hermitian field @xmath21 , that is the measure with covariance @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath23 represents the gaussian integration over @xmath16 , hence a big @xmath7 by @xmath7 determinant .",
    "it is convenient to view @xmath24 as @xmath25 .",
    "for instance the operator @xmath26    $ ] transforms the vector @xmath27 into @xmath28 .",
    "remark that this is an hermitian operator because @xmath21 is hermitian .    by duality of the matrix vertex",
    ", there is an exactly similar formula but with a left hermitian field @xmath29 acting on the left index , and with @xmath30 $ ] replacing @xmath31 $ ] . from now on we work only with the right field and drop the @xmath32 superscript for simplicity .",
    "we want to compute e.g. the normalization @xmath18 , which is the ( borel ) sum of all connected vacuum graphs .",
    "we define the loop vertex @xmath33 by @xmath34 and expand the exponential as @xmath35 . to compute the connected graphs we give a ( fictitious ) index @xmath36 to all the @xmath17 fields of a given loop vertex @xmath37 . at any order @xmath6",
    "the functional integral over @xmath38 is obviously also equal to the same integral but with a gaussian measure @xmath39 with degenerate covariance @xmath40 .",
    "we apply then the _ forest _ formula of @xcite to test connexity between the loop vertices from 1 to @xmath6 .",

    "this measure is well - defined because the matrix @xmath56 is positive .",

    "[ maintheor ] the series ( [ treeformul ] ) is absolutely convergent for @xmath10 small enough .    * proof *   consider a vertex @xmath37 of coordination @xmath57 in the tree .",
    "because the @xmath58 field acts only on right indices , and left indices are conserved , there is a single global @xmath3 factor for @xmath37 coming from the trace over the left index .",
    "we can then from now on essentially forget about the left indices except that they give a particular cyclic order on @xmath37",
    ". see figure [ tree ] for a tree on four loop vertices , hence with three lines .",
    "we compute now the outcome of the @xmath57 derivatives @xmath59 acting on @xmath60 which created this vertex .",

    "there is a unique position @xmath62 on the loop vertex from which a path in @xmath54 goes to @xmath63 , and the loop vertex factor @xmath37 after action of the derivatives is @xmath64     v_v = n ( -i \\sqrt { \\lambda /n})^{k_v }   \\prod_{i=1}^{k_v }   c(i , i+1 ; \\sigma^v)\\ ] ] where the cyclic convention is @xmath65 , and the operator @xmath66 acts only on the right index ( it is no longer a tensor product , since the left trace has been taken into account in the global @xmath3 factor in front of @xmath37 ) .    to bound the integrals over all sums @xmath67 ( which by the way are only about right indices )",
    "we need now only a very simple lemma :    [ key ] for any @xmath68 and @xmath69 we have the uniform bound @xmath70 \\bigg\\ } \\prod_v v_v    \\vert   \\le n^2\\ ] ]    * proof *   since @xmath71 is anti - hermitian we have indeed @xmath72 .",
    "the product over all vertices of the resolvents @xmath73 together with all the sums @xmath67 exactly forms a big trace of @xmath74 operators which turns around the tree ( see figure [ turnaround ] ) .",
    "this is the key point .",
    "this trace of an operator of norm smaller than 1 is bounded by @xmath3 .",
    "it remains now to collect the other factors .",
    "there is an @xmath3 factor for each vertex of the tree and a @xmath75 factor for each half line of the tree .",
    "collecting all the @xmath3 factors we get therefore a a @xmath76 global , @xmath6 independent factor as should be the case for vacuum graphs in this matrix @xmath77 theory , times @xmath78 .",
    "we can now integrate the previous bound over the complicated measure @xmath79 and over the @xmath80 parameters .",
    "but since our bound is independent of @xmath81 and @xmath82 s , since the measure @xmath83 is normalized , and each @xmath51 integral runs from 0 to 1 , the bound goes through .    finally by cayley",
    "s theorem the sum over trees costs @xmath84 the @xmath85 cancels with the @xmath86 and we remain with a geometric series bounded by @xmath87 hence convergent for @xmath88 .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem [ maintheor ] .",
    "rotating to complex @xmath10 and taylor expanding out a fixed number of vertices proves borel summability in @xmath10 _ uniformly in _ @xmath3 .",
    "* definition *    then every @xmath89 is borel summable @xcite , i.e. the power series @xmath90 converges for @xmath91 .",
    "it defines a function @xmath92 which has an analytic continuation in the @xmath3 independent strip @xmath93 .",
    "each such function satisfies the bound @xmath94 for some constants @xmath95 which may depend on @xmath3 .",
    "finally each @xmath89 is represented by the following absolutely convergent integral : @xmath96    [ borelunif ] the series for @xmath18 is uniformly borel summable with respect to the slice index @xmath3 .    * proof * it is easy to obtain uniform analyticity for @xmath97 and @xmath98 small enough , a region which obviously contains a disk @xmath99 .",
    "indeed all one has to do is to reproduce the previous argument but adding that for @xmath100 hermitian , the operator @xmath101 is bounded by 2 for @xmath102 .",
    "indeed if @xmath103 , we have @xmath104 .",
    "then the uniform bounds ( [ taylorremainder ] ) follow from expanding the product of resolvents in ( [ loopvertex ] ) up to order @xmath105 in @xmath10 . by an explicit taylor formula with integral remainder followed by explicit wick contractions .",
    "the sum over the contractions leads to the @xmath106 factor in ( [ taylorremainder ] ) ; in our case the constants @xmath107 actually depend on @xmath3 but this is allowed by our definition of uniform borel summability .",
    "to obtain the connected functions with external legs we need to add resolvents to the initial loop vertices .",
    "a resolvent is an operator @xmath108 , which can depend on only two indices because in a matrix model every entering index must go out .",
    "the connected functions @xmath109 therefore depend only on @xmath110 , not @xmath111 indices .",
    "they are obtained from the normalized functions by the standard procedure .",
    "we have the analog of formula [ treeformul ] for these connected functions :    @xmath112\\bigg\\ }   \\nonumber   \\int   d\\nu_t ( \\{\\sigma^v\\ } , \\ { w \\ } )    \\\\ & &   \\bigg\\ { \\prod_{\\ell\\in t } \\big [ \\delta _ { i_\\ell l_\\ell } \\delta_{j_\\ell k_\\ell }   \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta \\sigma^{v(\\ell)}_{i_\\ell , j_\\ell } }   \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta \\sigma^{v'(\\ell)}_{k_\\ell , l_\\ell } }   \\big ] \\bigg\\ }   \\bigg\\{\\prod_v v_v \\prod_{r=1}^{p }    c_{j}(\\sigma_{r } , z_{\\pi(r,1 ) } , z_{\\pi(r,2)})\\bigg\\ } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    * the sum over @xmath113 runs over the pairings of the @xmath11 external variables into pairs @xmath114 , @xmath115 , * each line @xmath42 of the tree joins two different loop vertices or resolvents @xmath116 and @xmath117 , * the sum is over trees joining the @xmath118 loop vertices and resolvents , which have therefore @xmath119 lines , * the measure @xmath120 over the vector fields @xmath121 has covariance @xmath122 where again for @xmath123 , @xmath124 is 1 if @xmath125 , and the infimum of the @xmath51 for @xmath42 running over the unique path from @xmath126 to @xmath127 in @xmath54 if @xmath128 .",
    "this expansion is convergent exactly as the initial one and we get :    the series ( [ treeformulext ] ) is absolutely convergent for @xmath10 small enough , and we have : @xmath129",
    "interacting goe and gue models can be treated along the same lines .",
    "let us consider for instance the same model than ( [ functional ] ) but with @xmath130 now an hermitian matrix .",
    "we have no longer a canonical distinction between left and right indices so that the intermediate field operator acts on both sides , but it is still anti - hermitian .",
    "the vertex operator ( [ vertex ] ) is therefore replaced by @xmath131),\\ ] ] so that each loop vertex is no longer simply proportional to @xmath3 because of e.g. the left trace . but any tree is planar so one can still draw the tree between loop vertices on a plane , as in figure 3 .",
    "the total number of traces of products of @xmath132 operators for a tree on @xmath6 vertices still remains @xmath133 by euler formula .",
    "indeed euler formula says @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the genus and @xmath136 is the number of faces , each costing @xmath3 .",
    "but graphs of genus 0 as those of figure 3 contain @xmath74 vertices ( of the cubic type ) , and two kinds of lines , the @xmath45 lines of the tree and the @xmath137 _ resolvent lines_. therefore @xmath138",
    "so that all the results of the previous sections remain valid .",
    "the genus expansion which lies at the root of matrix models can be generalized constructively .",
    "we can indeed expand the resolvents on the external loop which turns around the tree in figures 1 or 3 , and wick - contract one at a time the @xmath17 fields produced . if we were to perform this to all orders the expansion would diverge .",
    "however we can also contract until a fixed number of non - planar crossings are generated , and then stop .",
    "we call this expansion a  rosette expansion \"",
    ". it does not diverge and allows to extract the @xmath5 expansion up to a fixed genus @xmath135 , plus a smaller remainder .",
    "for instance for the normalization one obtains a representation @xmath139\\ ] ] where @xmath140 , the sum over all vacuum graphs of genus @xmath141 , is an analytic function of @xmath10 and @xmath142 is a convergent series whose sum is bounded by @xmath143 and is again borel summable in @xmath10 uniformly in @xmath3 .",
    "this remark is essential to construct @xmath0 through this method .",
    "we need indeed to identify the planar contributions with a single broken face and two or four external legs because they are the only ones which need to be renormalized , and also the only ones which can be renormalized ( because only planar graphs with a single broken face look like moyal products when seen from lower renormalization group scales @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore essential to have a method which can extract them from the rest of the expansion without violating the constructive golden rule .",
    "this can be done through the rosette expansion sketched above .",
    "to fully construct @xmath0 we have to take into account the fact that the propagator of @xmath0 in the matrix base does not exactly conserve matrix indices @xcite , except at @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is the grosse - wulkenhaar parameter .",
    "it is therefore essential to show not only uniform convergence but also decay of connected functions with respect to external matrix indices in this kind of models",
    ". this should not be too difficult using iterated resolvents bounds , as is shown in @xcite in the case of ordinary @xmath4 on commutative space .      to fully construct @xmath0 we have also to generalize the single @xmath3 analysis of this paper to a multiscale analysis such as the one of @xcite .",
    "this requires to optimize as usually the tree expansion over all the scales so that connected functions of higher scales are always correctly connected through the tree .",
    "in fact the @xmath0 can presumably also be built as easily in @xmath8 space representation by a slight modification of the matrix argument .",
    "indeed a moyal @xmath4 vertex can be decomposed in terms of an intermediate ultralocal real field with a @xmath146 interaction .",
    "this can again be done in two ways by duality .",
    "the new vertex is anti - hermitian again as a kernel between the @xmath147 and @xmath148 points .",
    "the bosonic covariance of the @xmath149 field is a mehler kernel that can be easily broken in square roots .",
    "we obtain loops of mehler kernels sandwiched between operators of the @xmath150 type .",
    "we expect therefore all constructive aspects to be also doable in @xmath8-space @xcite .",
    "since our loop vertex expansion seems very well suited to treat both large @xmath3 vector and large @xmath3 matrix limits , we expect that it is the right tool to glue different regimes of the renormalization group governed respectively e.g. in the ultraviolet regime by a small coupling expansion and in the infrared by a",
    " non - perturbative \" large @xmath3 expansion of vector or matrix type .",
    "this gluing problem occurs for the vector case in many different physical contexts , from mass generation of the two - dimensional gross - neveu @xcite or non - linear @xmath17-model @xcite to the bcs theory of supraconductivity @xcite .",
    "confinement itself could be a matrix version of the same gluing problem @xcite .",
    "all such gluing problems have been considered until now too complicated in practice for a rigorous ( i.e. constructive ) analysis .",
