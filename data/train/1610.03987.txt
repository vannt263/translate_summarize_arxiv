    "white dwarfs ( wds ) are the stellar remnants of low and intermediate mass stars , i.e. stars with masses @xmath1 10 m@xmath2 ( m@xmath2 being the mass of our sun ) @xcite .",
    "the interest in wd properties and in particular their mass - radius relation has been renewed by the recent discovery of overluminous type ia supernova ( snia ) @xcite .",
    "the progenitors of such events are thought to be `` super - chandrasekhar '' wds with a mass @xmath3 2 m@xmath2 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these snia may result from the merger of two massive wds or from the explosion of rapidly differentially rotating wds ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "alternatively , it has been argued that wds endowed with a strong magnetic field could be potential candidates for the progenitors of these peculiar snia @xcite . as a matter of fact",
    ", very massive strongly magnetised wds were proposed much earlier by @xcite ; this work , however , does not seem to have attracted much attention .",
    "the existence of magnetised supermassive wd is of interest not only for astrophysics , but also for cosmology since snia have been used as `` standard candles '' to measure cosmological distances assuming a unique astrophysical scenario for these events .",
    "the mass - radius relation for non - magnetic wds was established way back in @xcite by the pioneering work of @xcite , assuming a simple degenerate electron fermi gas equation of state ( eos ) at zero temperature .",
    "subsequently , other works attempted to construct more realistic models of wds .",
    "apart from the magnetic field , different effects could alter the chandrasekhar limit for the maximum mass of a wd :    * inclusion of finite temperature @xcite and slow rotation @xcite did not result in significant deviations from the chandrasekhar wd mass - radius relation .",
    "* the electrostatic interaction between electrons and ions introduced by @xcite was found to lower the electron pressure resulting in a softer eos and hence leads to slightly less massive configurations . * the effect of general relativity on the structure of non - magnetic wds",
    "was found to be non - negligible , reducing by a few per cent the wd maximum mass ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the existence of magnetised wds , with magnetic fields @xmath4  g @xcite , first predicted in the 1940s by @xcite , was confirmed in 1970 by @xcite ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a review ) . at the time of this writing",
    ", hundreds of magnetised wds have already been discovered @xcite . while surface magnetic fields up to about @xmath5  g can been inferred from zeeman spectroscopy and polarimetry , or cyclotron spectroscopy ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a review ) , internal magnetic fields are not directly accessible by observations .",
    "therefore , very strong magnetic fields in the core of wds , as high as @xmath6  g @xcite , can not be ruled out from a simple estimate of the energetics ( i.e. scalar virial theorem ) or the conservation of magnetic flux of the progenitor star .",
    "the question therefore arises of how such a strong magnetic field affects the structure of wds .",
    "the study of the mass - radius relation of a magnetised wd has a long history and it was recognised early on that the impact of the magnetic field on both the stellar radius and mass could be large .",
    "however , simplifying assumptions have been made for convenience .",
    "for instance , the pioneering work by @xcite considered a vanishing magnetic field at the surface of the star and neglected any magnetic field effect on the eos as well as general relativistic effects and electrostatic interactions .",
    "the works of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite focused on the effect of the magnetic field on the eos , taking into account the landau quantisation of the electron gas , but were based on a newtonian description of the star s structure in spherical symmetry , i.e. neglecting the deformation of the star by the magnetic field .",
    "a similar approach was followed by @xcite , where , however , the ( spherical ) stellar structure was calculated from the general relativistic tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations .",
    "the deformations of the star under the influence of a strong magnetic field have been recently studied by @xcite in the newtonian framework . @xcite and @xcite have computed the mass - radius relation of magnetic wds for different magnetic field geometries within a general relativistic framework using the publicly available xns code . on the other hand , landau quantisation effects were neglected .    according to all these previous studies , the maximum possible mass of strongly magnetised wds lies substantially above the chandrasekhar limit , and more importantly above the mass inferred from observations of overluminous snia , see also  @xcite .",
    "leaving aside the origin of such strong magnetic fields  more than three orders of magnitude higher than currently observed fields  , the question as to whether such stars can possibly exist still needs to be further examined .",
    "@xcite discussed various microscopic and macroscopic instabilities . in particular , @xcite pointed out that the stability of very massive magnetised wds will not only be limited by general relativity , but also by electron captures by nuclei and pycnonuclear reactions in the stellar core .",
    "these microscopic processes , whose onset depends on the magnetic field strength @xcite , should thus be carefully considered in modelling massive magnetised wds .    in this study , we address these stability issues . to this end",
    ", we shall construct consistent global general relativistic models of strongly magnetised wds , taking into account the magnetic field effects on both the eos and the wd equilibrium structure equations .",
    "this work follows directly from our previous study of the structure of strongly magnetised neutron stars @xcite .",
    "we shall account for the onset of electron capture and pycnonuclear reactions , including the shifts on the threshold densities and pressures due to electron - ion interactions and to the strong magnetic field .",

    "as elaborated in @xcite , the electromagnetic field tensor can be chosen to be either purely poloidal or purely toroidal .",
    "within the numerical scheme of lorene , the magnetic field configuration is purely poloidal by construction .",
    "this is convenient for comparison with the observed surface poloidal fields as estimated from the spin - down measurements of pulsars .",
    "however , for neutron stars , it has been suggested that amplification of the seed poloidal magnetic field could result in the generation of strong toroidal fields .",
    "following the same arguments , one may argue that the same holds for strongly magnetised wds .",

    "for the twisted torus mixed configuration ( with a dominant poloidal field ) , the mass - radius relations obtained were similar to those of the purely poloidal case .      in @xcite , some of us explicitly derived the generalised expression for the thermodynamic average of the microscopic energy - momentum tensor , which is required for the study of the macroscopic structure of a compact object , as recapitulated below : @xmath80 where , @xmath81 is the matter energy density , @xmath70 is the matter pressure ( see sec .",

    "these equations are then solved for a given matter content .",
    "note that , in this section , latin letters i , j ,   are used for spatial indices only , whereas greek ones @xmath99 , @xmath75 ,   denote the spacetime indices .    whereas the homogeneous maxwell equation is automatically verified by the expression   for the electromagnetic field tensor , the inhomogeneous one must be modified to include the contribution from the magnetisation @xcite : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the free current which generates the electromagnetic field , as opposed to the bound current contribution associated with the magnetisation ( last term in the above equation ) . for a discussion about these free currents , which are not driven by the bulk motion of matter ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "to obtain equilibrium configurations , one must solve the coupled einstein - maxwell equations , together with the condition of conservation of energy and momentum @xmath102 , giving rise to the equilibrium condition in our stationary case .",
    "it was already illustrated in @xcite that on inclusion of the magnetisation current density in the equation of equilibrium , the lorentz force associated with the magnetisation current cancels with the magnetisation contribution arising from the pressure gradient ( key equations are recapitulated in the appendix [ a : app ] ) .",
    "therefore , there is no explicit magnetisation appearing in the equilibrium condition , and the first integral of fluid stationary motion remains unchanged retaining the same form as in the case without magnetisation ( see details in app .

    "we summarise here the basic stellar structure equations that the general relativistic equations reduce to in the newtonian limit .",
    "whereas for maxwell equations one must consider the special - relativistic form , the newtonian limit of the einstein equations is the poisson equation for the gravitational potential @xmath110 : @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the gravitational constant and @xmath27 is the mass density .",
    "thus in the non - relativistic limit , the factor @xmath113 tends to the newtonian gravitational potential @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "the first integral of motion ( eq . [ eq:1st_integral ] ) , described in the previous section , reduces to a simple form in the newtonian limit in the absence of an electromagnetic field @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the non - relativistic enthalpy ( _ i.e. _ @xmath116 , @xmath117 being the internal energy , not taking into account rest - mass energy density ) and @xmath118 the fluid velocity in the @xmath119-direction .",
    "note here that , as shown , e.g. , by @xcite this is not the classical bernoulli equation , but a first integral of motion , which is valid only if the fluid is in pure circular motion , while the bernoulli theorem is valid for any stationary flow .",
    "moreover , the expression for the bernoulli theorem provides a constant along each fluid line , which may vary from one fluid line to another , whereas the first integral   gives a constant valid in the entire star",
    ".    in presence of free currents @xmath120 , see eq .",
    "and of the electromagnetic field they generate , a force term of the form @xmath121 is added to the equation of stationary motion @xcite .",
    "now , using the definition of @xmath122  ( [ e : def_fmunu ] ) , together with the newtonian limit ( _ i.e. _ the metric potentials @xmath123 and @xmath124 ) in eqs .  , and writing the 4-currents @xmath125 as a charge density @xmath126 and a current vector @xmath127 separately , one gets the standard form for the force : @xmath128 as we assume the matter inside the star to be a perfect conductor , we have the relation : @xmath129 with @xmath130 the fluid velocity is the angular velocity and @xmath131 is the local triad vector associated with the @xmath119-coordinate . ] ( thus , @xmath132 ) .",
    "the newtonian interpretation of our requirement of having a first integral of motion , with the introduction of the potential @xmath108  , is that the electromagnetic force be potential - like : @xmath133 the equilibrium equation in the newtonian case then reads : @xmath134 as demonstrated before in the relativistic case , note again that the above equations for equilibrium do not contain any contribution from the magnetisation .",

    "we have determined the threshold densities and pressures consistently with the eos , including for the first time the effects due to both electron - ion interactions and the magnetic field . given the high uncertainties on the pycnonuclear fusion reaction rates ,",
    "we have estimated the maximum possible reduction of the wd mass by assuming that these processes set in at the same threshold density and pressure as electron captures by the daughter nuclei .",

    "we come to the conclusion that , from the currently observed wds , none could be detected by the future space - based gravitational - wave detector elisa .",
    "extremely - magnetised wds can thus in principle reach masses higher than @xmath194 and remain stable with respect to gravitational and electron capture instabilities ; the consequence being that they would have torus - like shapes . on the other hand , pycnonuclear instablities could severely limit the existence of such stars , but one must keep in mind the high uncertainties associated with these reactions . in summary , the possibility of super - chandrasekhar strongly magnetised wds can not be totally excluded from current theoretical considerations , but important issues still need to be addressed before any firm conclusions on their existence could be drawn .",
