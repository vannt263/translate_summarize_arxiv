    "in recent years , with the advent of the emerging field of surface plasmon photonics or  plasmonics \" @xcite , subwavelength waveguides at optical frequencies have attracted much attention .",
    "different types of waveguides have been proposed and investigated for their ability to guide optical waves with subwavelength cross sectional mode dimensions @xcite . based on these waveguides , several passive and active devices and elements such as bends , interferometers , filters , resonators , and lasers",
    "have been demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "although waveguides with subwavelength mode dimensions such as coaxial and microstrip lines are widely used at millimeter wave , microwave and lower frequencies without a significant loss , at higher frequencies metal absorption loss has been an obstacle for plasmonic waveguides to find practical applications . in some of the studies",
    ", it has been noted that there is a trade - off between the confinement of a waveguide mode and its attenuation constant @xcite .",
    "here , we show that regardless of the waveguide shape and design , for a desired mode size , there is a fundamental lower bound on its attenuation constant .",
    "the existence of such a limit is a generalization of the diffraction limit which imposes a lower bound on confinement of free propagating waves .",
    "therefore , we use a similar approach to the one used for deriving the diffraction limit .",
    "the fields are considered in spectral domain and the waveguide is replaced with a equivalent current distribution .",
    "this is this current distribution which allows for confinement beyond the diffraction limit , and since it is supported by the lossy waveguide material , it causes the propagation loss .",
    "we show that for achieving tighter confinement , larger equivalent currents are required which cause higher propagation loss .",
    "surrounded by lossless material with permittivity of @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath1 axis of the coordinate system is parallel to the waveguide axis . ]",
    "we consider a general waveguide made of a non - magnetic material with permittivity of @xmath2 surrounded by a lossless material with permittivity of @xmath0 ( as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : waveguide ] ) .",
    "the surrounding material may fill the entire space around the waveguide or only the space near the waveguide where the fields have significant values .",
    "we assume that the waveguide has no variations along its axis , and the coordinate system is chosen in a way that its @xmath1 axis is aligned with the waveguide axis .",
    "we also assume time dependency of @xmath3 and @xmath1 variation of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are phase and attenuation constants , respectively .",
    "the electric and magnetic fields of the waveguide mode satisfy the maxwell s equations in the entire space    @xmath8    with @xmath9 representing the equivalent current density defined as @xmath10 @xmath11 is spatially varying relative permittivity describing the waveguide and its surrounding media .",
    "therefore , the waveguide is replaced by an equivalent volume current density which is nonzero only at locations which used to be occupied by the waveguide , and is zero elsewhere . from the maxwell",
    "s equations ( 1a)-(1d ) , second order equations for electric and magnetic fields can be derived as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the wave number in the surrounding medium .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : firstmaxwell ] ) can be written as @xmath14 using the identity for curl of product of a scalar and a vector , left hand side of ( [ eq : firstmaxwell_2 ] ) can be expended as @xmath15 scalar multiplication of both sides of ( [ eq : firstmaxwell_expanded ] ) by @xmath16 , and integrating over the waveguide cross section ( @xmath17 plane ) gives @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the differential of the cross sectional area , and the integrals in ( [ eq : s ] ) and all other integrals in this paper are taken over the entire cross sectional plane .",
    "@xmath20 is the complex power passing through the waveguide cross section .",
    "it should be noted that for a mode with propagation constant of @xmath21 , @xmath22 has no @xmath1 dependence .",
    "it is useful to define @xmath23 the material loss of the waveguide per unit length can be found using ( [ eq : j ] ) @xmath24 and using the poynting s theorem for an infinitesimal slice of waveguide along its axis , the attenuation constant can be shown to be given by @xmath25 attenuation constant represents the waveguide propagation loss .",
    "we use the normalized second central moment of the magnetic energy density in the waveguide cross section as a criterion for the mode confinement . for a normalized mode with @xmath26 , this central moment",
    "is defined as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is radial distance from the @xmath1 axis of the coordinate system .",
    "we show that for a given value for the second central moment , a lower limit for the attenuation constant of the mode exists . to this end",
    ", we express the fields in the spectral domain .",

    "the inequality ( [ eq : alpha_7 ] ) shows that for a given waveguide mode size and a waveguide material , there is an upper limit on the propagation length . as it was mentioned earlier , the limit is the result of the absorption loss of the waveguide material . for achieving sub - diffraction limit confinement of waves ,",
    "a nonzero equivalent current density should exist .",
    "as we showed , higher confinement requires a larger equivalent current density .",
    "because the equivalent current density is supported by the waveguide core the larger equivalent current density means higher absorption loss ; therefore , shorter propagation length .    as it can be seen from ( [ eq : alpha_7 ] ) , the material properties are only present as a multiplicative factor .",
