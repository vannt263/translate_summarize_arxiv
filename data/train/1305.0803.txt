    "in its general form , the problem of the theory of figures is to find the external gravitational potential of a liquid planet in hydrostatic equilibrium , rotating at a uniform rate @xmath2 , and obeying a specified barotropic relationship for the dependence of pressure @xmath3 on mass density @xmath4 .    the expected precision ( @xmath5 one part in @xmath6 ) of the @xmath7 jupiter orbiter spacecraft s measurements of jupiter s gravity field will require a gravitational - modeling theory of unprecedented accuracy @xcite .",
    "@xcite ( paper i ) is an initial step toward such a theory .",
    "paper i presents a new approach to the calculation of the multipole expansion of the external gravitational potential of a rotating planet in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "as is well known , the problem of the theory of figures can be solved in closed or partially - closed form for a small number of special barotropes but arbitrary barotropes generally require numerical methods .",
    "analytic methods balloon in complexity even for the apparently simple case of two constant - density layers , the so - called two - layer maclaurin spheroid @xcite . in principle , such analytic complexity could be bypassed by seeking a purely numerical solution to the general equation of hydrostatic equilibrium . however ,",
    "numerical solutions are vulnerable to numerical noise , produced for example by cancellation of nearly equal terms . in the traditional approach ,",
    "cancellation of terms is mitigated by solving a hierarchy of integrodifferential equations generated from a perturbation expansion of the mass distribution in powers of the rotation rate @xcite .",
    "paper i shows how the particular problem of the hydrostatic equilibrium of a rotating constant - density planet can be numerically solved to high precision by using gaussian quadrature to obtain the mass multipole moments . in this method ,",
    "the moments are calculated by performing one - dimensional integrals over the surface mass distribution .",
    "although gaussian quadrature is a numerical approximation to analytic integration , the results are exact ( to within the floating point precision of the computer ) , as long as the integrand can be expressed as a polynomial of degree less than the degree of the gaussian quadrature ; for a maclaurin spheroid , using this approach with 48 quadrature points yields numerical results with a precision of at least @xmath8 .",
    "the mass multipole moments are then self - consistently iterated on the shape of the surface ( paper i ) .",
    "the method of paper i largely bypasses the analytic complexity of perturbation methods and avoids cancellation problems , but as presented is only valid for a constant - density object , or for a constant - density object with special boundary conditions .",
    "the present paper shows how the method of paper i is straightforwardly generalized to solve the problem of multiple - layered constant - density spheroids .",
    "the resulting method , which i call the concentric maclaurin spheroid ( cms ) method , retains all of the advantages of the approach of paper i , with the additional flexibility that the concentric maclaurin spheroids can be arranged in sufficient numbers to closely approximate any prescribed barotrope .",
    "as we will see , an actual density discontinuity such as a discrete core or first - order phase transition is trivially incorporated in the cms method , as opposed to the usual theories of figures .    in the following section 2 ,",
    "i present the analytic development of the cms method . in section 3 ,",
    "i apply the cms method to several published test cases and i show how the method can incorporate a prescribed barotrope . in the conclusion ( section 4 ) , i discuss how the cms method can be applied to analysis of _ juno _ gravity data expected to arrive beginning in 2016 .",

    "i compare three models adopted by @xcite : `` mars '' , `` neptune '' , and `` uranus2 '' .",
    "the quantities that they compute for these models are @xmath140 , and @xmath141 and @xmath142 , respectively the eccentricities of the outer surface and intermediate surface , defined by @xmath143 where the oblateness @xmath144 .",
    "the cms calculations require iteration to match the values of @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",

    "the polytrope of index one is defined by the barotrope @xmath147 where the polytropic constant @xmath148 is chosen in the present application to yield a model planet matched to jupiter s mass and equatorial radius .",
    "rotating planet models obeying this barotrope have been extensively studied @xcite , so it provides a rigorous test of the cms method .",
    "moreover , the study presented in this section provides a useful illustration of how , for a chosen barotrope , one may choose cms arrays of @xmath122 and @xmath121 to yield a close match to the barotrope .",
    "for a nonrotating @xmath149 polytrope , the density distribution is given by @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the central density . to obtain a first approximation to the @xmath152 distribution over the spheroids , we differentiate : @xmath153 and we use this relation to obtain starting values of the @xmath121 .",
    "after obtaining a converged hydrostatic - equilibrium model for @xmath1 spheroids with the above array of @xmath121 , one calculates the arrays @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "next one calculates an array of desired densities @xmath156 according to @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the inverse of the adopted barotrope @xmath159 . differencing the desired densities between layers then gives a new array of @xmath121 . in general , it is necessary to scale the densities so as to obtain the correct total mass of the cms model .",
    "this can be effected by rewriting the barotrope as @xmath160 where @xmath161 is a dimensionless factor .",
    "for the polytrope of index one , when one adopts a value of @xmath161 greater or less than one , this is equivalent to redefining the value of @xmath148 .    after obtaining a new converged cms model , the process of adjusting the densities to obtain a new array of @xmath156 , etc .",
    ", continues until all changes in gravitational moments and in the value of @xmath161 are reduced to within a specified tolerance . because of the additional step of fitting the barotrope , more iterations are required for convergence .",
    "figure 6 shows the fitted and target @xmath149 barotrope of a converged 512-layer cms model of jupiter .",
    "the comparison models for the @xmath149 polytrope are ( 1 ) analytic expansions of @xmath140 , @xmath162 , and @xmath163 to order @xmath164 @xcite , and ( 2 ) a self - consistent - field calculation of the rotating polytrope based on the analytic result that the interior density can be expanded as a series of products of spherical harmonics and spherical bessel functions @xmath165 @xcite .",
    "table 6 presents results for @xmath166 and @xmath167 cms models along with the comparison models .",
    "the results for @xmath140 for the @xmath167 cms model were still changing in the fifth figure after the decimal point after fifteen iterations on the barotrope fit .",
    "@xcite have criticized the maclaurin spheroid approach employed in this paper , stating that the method of paper i is incomplete .",
    "further clarification is called for since the method of paper i is central to the cms method .    consider a maclaurin spheroid of eccentricity @xmath135 .",
    "for its external potential write , as usual , @xmath168.\\ ] ] where does this infinite - series expansion diverge for the maclaurin spheroid ?",
    "evaluate it at the spheroid s pole , where @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",

    "we get    @xmath171.\\ ] ]    the ratio of the @xmath172-th to the @xmath173-th term is    @xmath174    therefore the series converges if @xmath175 or the oblateness @xmath176 , in agreement with the estimate of @xcite . the corresponding @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "these values are far larger than the parameters of any known planet .",
    "note , by the way , that the point of bifurcation for the maclaurin - jacobi ellipsoid sequence is at a somewhat larger @xmath179 , corresponding to @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "paper i shows that for a maclaurin spheroid with jupiter s @xmath182 , my method gives for the shape of the spheroid s surface a numerical result that differs no more than a few parts in @xmath183 from the exact maclaurin shape .",
    "note that figure 5 of this paper shows similarly - small departures at the outer surface and on an intermediate surface .",
    "thus , for this value of @xmath133 , any neglected terms in equation ( 66 ) will not exceed @xmath8 of the included terms .    repeating the calculation for a maclaurin spheroid with a saturn - like @xmath184 ,",
    "i obtain results shown in figure 7 for the relative difference of the spheroid s surface radius from the exact maclaurin ellipsoid shape .",
    "the departures are , in absolute terms , no more than a few centimeters , and would have no significance whatsoever for practical models of saturn s gravity field .",
    "moreover , the real saturn is much less oblate than the maclaurin model , so the departures of a cms model from an `` exact '' model will be smaller still .    as in paper",
    "i , the general cms method relies upon the requirement that the external multipole expansion ( 66 ) of a given spheroid s potential converges at all points on the spheroid s surface .",
    "first , on a sphere of radius @xmath185 , the expansion converges . to see this , note that @xmath186 for a uniformly - rotating body in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "thus , on the sphere @xmath187 , the ratio of the @xmath172-th term to the @xmath173-th term is @xmath188 , so for @xmath189 the series converges .",
    "next we examine the series convergence at the pole , @xmath190 , where @xmath191 , where @xmath192 is the oblateness . at @xmath190 ,",
    "the ratio of the @xmath172-th term to the @xmath173-th term is @xmath193 .",
    "thus , as long as @xmath194 ( where @xmath195 is a constant of order unity whose precise value depends on the barotrope ) the series converges .",
    "as discussed , the @xmath133 values for jupiter and saturn are such that the convergence criterion is well satisfied ( as numerically demonstrated for the test cases ) .",
    "see also a relevant discussion in section 38 of @xcite .",
    "the cms analysis technique presented here can be vectorized for efficiency , although no significant effort has been made to do so at this point .",
    "for practical computations it will probably be necessary to further increase @xmath1 and to increase the number of iterations on the barotrope fit , in order to match the theoretical results to the expected precision of spacecraft measurements .",
    "further iteration loops will be required if a subset of the calculated @xmath196 are to be fitted to observed values .",
    "adjustable parameters might include : ( 1 ) the mass and density of a discrete core at the planet s center , ( 2 ) chemical and density discontinuities at various layers , and ( 3 ) modifications to the assumed barotrope ( crudely illustrated in this paper with the scale factor @xmath161 ) .    as is obvious",
    ", there exists an infinity of possible arrangements of spheroids which can be fitted to a finite set of gravity data .",
    "thus , a unique inversion can not be achieved .",
    "however , application of specific physically - based barotropes and cosmochemical considerations can lead to the most realistic interior models .",
    "one can further generalize the cms method in two directions .",
    "first , in addition to the rotational potential @xmath67 one may introduce a tidal potential from a satellite .",
    "the resulting tidal perturbing potential @xmath197 will be a function of two angular variables , @xmath16 and @xmath198 , where @xmath198 is the angle from the sub - satellite longitude .",
    "since @xmath197 will excite both zonal and tesseral gravity harmonics , evaluation of the response on all cms surfaces will require two - dimensional rather than one - dimensional integrals .",
    "however , there appears to be no practical barrier to evaluating such integrals using two - dimensional gaussian quadrature ( to be sure , at the cost of more computing time ) .",
