    "the investigation of the long - time mode of behaviour of the regimes of tokamak plasma improved confinement , where e x b flow shear stabilization mechanisms @xcite plays a key role , is the theme of major importance in the physics of continuous tokamaks operation .",
    "gyrokinetic theory @xcite gives a foundation for the investigating microinstabilities , which cause the anomalous transport in fusion plasmas .",
    "while there has been significant progress in gyrokinetic treatment of tokamak turbulence ( see , for example , refs.@xcite-@xcite ) , there key issues still remain in application of the gyrokinetic theory to analytical investigations of the long - time evolution of plasma shear flows turbulence .    in ref.@xcite",
    "we have developed new kinetic description of the plasma shear flows , using the kelvin s method of shearing modes or so - called non - modal approach as its foundation .",
    "the governing equation in that theory is the integral equation for the perturbed electrostatic potential , which is the formal solution of the initial value problem for vlasov - poisson ( v - p ) system .",
    "the important procedure in its derivation is the transformation of v - p system to sheared ( in space and velocity ) coordinates convected with flow and accounting for by this mean the effect of spatial time - dependent distortion of plasma disturbances by shear flows . in that equation ,",
    "velocity shear reveals as the non - modal time - dependent effect of the finite larmor radius . because of the shearing of perturbations in shear flow , the component of the wave number along the direction of the velocity shear experiences the growth with time , and therefore results obtained for the hydrodynamic drift instabilities on the base of the fluid description are valid only for finite times till @xmath0 is valid ( @xmath1 is thermal ion larmor radius ) .",
    "therefore , not only kinetic , but also typically hydrodynamic instabilities of shearless plasma require the kinetic description for plasma shear flows for proper treating their evolution on times , at which @xmath2 becomes not small and approaches unity and above .",
    "it reveals@xcite , that conventional kinetic theory , as well as the gyrokinetic theory , in which the time dependence of the perturbed distribution functions and fields are considered in a canonical modal form , @xmath3 , are valid only at the initial stage of the shear flow turbulence evolution , at times less then the inverse velocity shearing rate @xmath4 .",
    "the theory developed displays that the experimentally observed suppression of drift - type turbulence and the improved energy confinement are appreciable at @xmath5 , i.e. just after that time . in our analysis of the kinetic drift instability",
    "we have obtained @xcite , that in linear theory of the kinetic ( universal ) drift instability , shear flow leads at time @xmath6 to the non - modal decrease with time the frequency and growth rate and to ultimate suppression of that instability .",

    "we find that the ordinary modal theory of this instability is valid only for times less than the inverse velocity shearing rate . at times",
