    "the 6@xmath2 cm transition of formaldehyde ( h@xmath0co , j@xmath3 ) was among the first molecular lines detected in the interstellar medium .",
    "this transition is ubiquitously observed in absorption against galactic continuum sources ( e.g. , araya et al .",
    "2002 ) as well as against the 2.7@xmath2k cosmic microwave background ( e.g. , palmer et al .",
    "in contrast , only a handful of h@xmath0co 6@xmath2 cm emitters have been detected : h@xmath0co megamaser emission has been confirmed toward three galaxies ( araya , baan & hofner 2004a ) , and in our galaxy h@xmath0co emission has been detected toward 5 sources : ( quasi ) thermal emission toward the orion bn / kl region , and maser emission toward ngc@xmath27538 irs1 , sgr b2 , g29.96@xmath10.02 , and recently iras@xmath218566 + 0408 ( araya et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "all galactic emitters are found in close proximity to signposts of young massive stars , indicating that the physical conditions necessary for h@xmath0co 6@xmath2 cm emission occur in early phases of massive star formation .",
    "in addition , the low detection rate of h@xmath0co masers may be a consequence of specific and short lived physical conditions in massive star forming regions , thus h@xmath0co masers could become a valuable astrophysical probe if the excitation mechanism of the maser was known .",
    "however , the physical mechanism for h@xmath0co 6@xmath2 cm maser emission is still not understood .",
    "currently , the only quantitative model proposed to explain h@xmath0co 6@xmath2 cm masers is that of boland & de jong ( 1981 ) , where the level inversion is caused by the radio continuum from a background compact hii region .",
    "unfortunately , this model can not explain most of the known h@xmath0co 6@xmath2 cm masers ( e.g. , hoffman et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the lack of progress in the understanding of the h@xmath0co 6@xmath2 cm maser mechanism is in part due to the small sample of known h@xmath0co maser regions .",
    "a larger sample of h@xmath0co maser regions would not only serve to further test the boland & de jong ( 1981 ) model , but also to investigate the dependence of h@xmath0co masers on a larger variety of physical environments , e.g. , to check whether h@xmath0co masers are preferentially associated with shocked gas or with more quiescent molecular material that could be radiatively excited .    with the goal of increasing the number of known h@xmath0co 6@xmath2 cm maser regions , we conducted in 2002 and 2003 a survey for h@xmath0co 6@xmath2 cm emission with the arecibo telescope ( araya et al .",
    "2004b ) . in the survey we observed massive star forming regions characterized by high molecular densities and low radio - continuum at 6@xmath2 cm , and detected h@xmath0co 6@xmath2 cm maser emission toward iras@xmath218566 + 0408 ( araya et al .",
    "motivated by our first arecibo survey , we recently completed a second survey with the gbt and vlam green bank telescope ( gbt ) and the very large array ( vla ) are operated by the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) , a facility of the national science foundation operated under cooperative agreement by associated universities , inc . ] .",
    "the main result of our second survey , which is reported in this letter , is the discovery of a new h@xmath0co 6@xmath2 cm maser toward the massive star forming region g23.71@xmath10.20 .",
    "on 2005 january 10 , we conducted an h@xmath0co 6@xmath2 cm maser survey toward 10 massive star forming regions with the vla in the a configuration .",
    "the sources were selected based on single dish h@xmath0co spectra that had been obtained by our group with the arecibo and gbt telescopes ( watson et al .",
    "2003 , sewilo et al .",
    "2004a ) , and that were consistent with h@xmath0co absorption blended with emission .",
    "we detected radio continuum and h@xmath0co 6@xmath2 cm absorption toward several regions , and a new h@xmath0co 6@xmath2 cm emitter toward g23.71@xmath10.20 ( iras@xmath218324@xmath10820 ) .",
    "this latter detection is the topic of this letter .",
    "the results for the non - emitting regions will be presented in a future paper ( araya et al .",
    "_ in prep .",
    "further observations of the g23.71@xmath10.20 region were conducted on 2005 april 24 , with the vla in the b configuration .",
    "these observations were intended to confirm the detection . in table  1 , we list details of the spectral line observations conducted with the vla in the a and b configurations . the data were calibrated and imaged in aips following standard spectral - line reduction procedures . only external calibration ( i.e. , no self - calibration )",
    "was used to obtain the complex gain corrections for data calibration .",
    "we did not detect radio continuum in individual channels , hence continuum subtraction was not necessary .",
    "no bandpass calibration was necessary due to the narrow bandwidth .",
    "using the vla in the a configuration we detected h@xmath0co 6@xmath2 cm emission toward g23.71@xmath10.20 .",
    "the emission was detected in two channels ( i.e. , width 0.76 ) with an rms noise of 4.5@xmath2 in a natural weighted map .",
    "the peak intensity is i@xmath460   at the velocity v@xmath579.2 .",
    "the maximum intensity of the h@xmath0co emission is located at @xmath6(j2000 ) = 18@xmath735@xmath81237 , @xmath9(j2000 ) = @xmath10817393 .",
    "the emission feature is unresolved ( @xmath1004 ) , which implies a lower limit on the brightness temperature of @xmath1130000@xmath2k , i.e. , the emission is due to a maser mechanism .",
    "the intensity of this new maser is similar to the 70@xmath2mjy / beam of the maser in g29.96@xmath10.02 ( pratap , menten , & snyder , 1994 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the maser in g23.71@xmath10.20 is narrower in comparison with other h@xmath0co masers ( e.g. , the fwhm of the maser in iras@xmath218566 + 0408 is 1.6 , araya et al .",
    "2005 , whereas the fwhm of the new maser is smaller than 0.8 ) .",
    "the vla - b observations confirmed the existence of the h@xmath0co 6@xmath2 cm maser in g23.71@xmath10.20 .",
    "as in the vla - a observations , the maser is detected in two channels ( 0.76 ) with a signal to noise ratio greater than 4 ( rms @xmath11 6.0 ) .",
    "we measured a peak velocity and intensity values of v@xmath12   and i@xmath444  ( t@xmath13k ) , respectively .",
    "the h@xmath0co peak intensity measured with the vla - b is less than the peak intensity measured with the vla - a , however both values are consistent within 5@xmath14 .",
    "we combined the vla - a and b _ uv _ data to produce the map and spectrum shown in figure  1 .",
    "the spectrum in figure  1 shows that h@xmath0co emission may also be present in the two lower - velocity channels blueward of the peak channel .",
    "g23.71@xmath10.20 is a massive star forming region located in the scutum constellation .",
    "sewilo et al .",
    "( 2004a ) reported h110@xmath6 emission from the region at a lsr velocity of 76.5 , hence , the h@xmath0co maser lsr velocity is coincident ( within @xmath112.7 ) with the h110@xmath6 line center .",
    "this velocity correspondence implies that the h@xmath0co maser is associated with the g23.71@xmath10.20 massive star forming region .",
    "based on the lsr velocity of the h110@xmath6 line , the two possible kinematic distances of g23.71@xmath10.20 are 4.9@xmath2kpc and 11@xmath2kpc .",
    "sewilo et al .",
    "( 2004a ) considered the far kinematic distance ( i.e. , d@xmath15kpc ) as more likely .",
    "becker et al . ( 1994 ) ( see also white , becker , & helfand 2005 ) detected 6@xmath2 cm radio continuum from the region . in figure",
    "2 we show their vla - c 6@xmath2 cm continuum map .",
    "as the figure illustrates , the h@xmath0co maser is not coincident with the strong radio continuum emission , but rather lies in an area of more diffuse emission .",
    "apart from the 6@xmath2 cm detection by white et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , no other high - angular resolution detection of the radio continuum at frequencies above 2@xmath2ghzcm ) surveys : nvss ( condon , et al .",
    "1998 ) , and the multi - array galactic plane imaging survey ( white et al . 2005 ) . ]",
    "is available .",
    "future high - angular resolution observations of the radio continuum of the region at several frequencies are required to test if the h@xmath0co maser in g23.71@xmath10.20 can be explained by the boland & de jong ( 1981 ) model .",
    "the radio continuum source in g23.71@xmath10.20 is coincident with iras@xmath218324@xmath10820 , which has the characteristic far - infrared color of ultra - compact h ii regions ( sewilo et al .",
    "2004a ) . assuming a distance of 11@xmath2kpc , isotropic emission , and following the formulation of casoli et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , we estimate a bolometric luminosity of @xmath16 , which corresponds to the luminosity of an @xmath11o6 zams star ( panagia 1973 ) .",
    "high angular resolution studies of molecular line transitions toward g23.71@xmath10.20 are as scarce as the radio continuum observations .",
    "the only available interferometric molecular data of the region are from walsh et al .",
    "they detected seven ch@xmath17oh 6.7@xmath2ghz maser spots in the region . in figure  2 , we show the positions of these masers .",
    "the ch@xmath17oh 6.7@xmath2ghz masers are all coincident with the h@xmath0co 6@xmath2 cm maser within @xmath111@xmath18 , which is the absolute positional accuracy of the ch@xmath17oh masers ( walsh et al .",
    "the masers are spread over a velocity range from 74.9 to 81.4 , which encompasses the velocity of the h@xmath0co maser ( 79.2 ) .",
    "g23.71@xmath10.20 has been detected in several single dish surveys for ch@xmath17oh masers : blaszkiewicz & kus ( 2004 ) ( 12.2@xmath2ghz ch@xmath17oh masers ) ; schutte et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , slysh et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , szymczak , hrynek , & kus ( 2000 ) ( 6.7@xmath2ghz ch@xmath17oh masers ) . in all cases ,",
    "the ch@xmath17oh masers show similar velocities to that of the h@xmath0co maser .",
    "g23.71@xmath10.20 was also observed in cs j=2 - 1 by bronfman , nyman , & may ( 1996 ) .",
    "they detected cs j=2 - 1 emission at a velocity of 68.3 , which is approximately 10  lower than that of the h@xmath0co maser .",
    "finally , han et al . ( 1998 ) conducted a survey of 22@xmath2ghz h@xmath0o masers at the purple mountain observatory , and report detection of a 35.6@xmath2jy h@xmath0o maser at a lsr velocity of @xmath140.3 .",
    "this radial velocity is very different from the velocity of the h@xmath0co maser ( 79.2 ) , thus the association of this h@xmath0o maser with the h@xmath0co and ch@xmath17oh masers is unclear .",
    "we searched the msx and spitzer / irac glimpse images for infrared ( ir ) emission in the vicinity of the h@xmath0co maser position .",
    "the 21.3 @xmath19 m emission seen in the msx e band ( angular resolution 18@xmath20 ) partly traces the two main 6@xmath2 cm continuum emission regions to the se and sw of the maser position , but also shows extended emission near the maser position .",
    "the spitzer / irac glimpse data show a compact ir source located within @xmath21 of the h@xmath0co maser position .",
    "this source is detected in all four irac bands . in figure",
    "3 we show a color  coded image of the spitzer data ( blue is the average of the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath19 m data , green is 5.8 @xmath19 m , and red is 8.0 @xmath19 m ) , and we mark the position of the h@xmath0co maser with a cross . while the [ 3.6][4.5 ] color of 2.1 is indicative of a deeply embedded object , the [ 5.8][8.0 ] color of 0.1 is peculiar in combination with the first color ( see indebetouw et al .",
    "the [ 5.8][8.0 ] color could be caused by unresolved source multiplicity and/or the presence of pah emission features .",
    "in addition , strong and broad @xmath1110 @xmath19 m silicate absorption could be affecting the 8.0 @xmath19 m band .",
    "high angular resolution infrared observations are underway to further study this ir source .",
    "the inversion mechanism of h@xmath0co 6@xmath2 cm masers is unclear ( e.g. , mehringer , goss , & palmer 1994 ) . besides the model by boland & de jong ( 1981 ) which is based on radiative excitation by radio continuum , hoffman et al .",
    "( 2003 ) suggested that h@xmath0co 6@xmath2 cm masers could be collisionally pumped .",
    "the new detection of an h@xmath0co 6@xmath2 cm maser in g23.71@xmath10.20 and the coincidence of the maser with a spitzer compact source ( figure  3 ) suggests another possibility : h@xmath0co 6@xmath2 cm masers could be radiatively pumped by ir photons in massive star forming regions .",
    "a connection between fir radiation and h@xmath0co 6@xmath2 cm masers has been noticed before in megamaser galaxies , e.g. , the data by araya et al .",
    "( 2004a ) suggest a correlation between the luminosity of h@xmath0co megamaser lines and fir luminosity ( see also baan , haschick , & uglesich 1993 ) .",
    "in addition , litvak ( 1970 ) pointed out that absorption of infrared radiation in conjunction with large h@xmath0co optical depths and h@xmath0co density comparable to that of oh maser regions , may result in h@xmath0co maser emission .",
    "quantitative models have been developed to explain oh masers via fir radiative excitation ( e.g. , henkel , gsten , & baan 1987 ; cesaroni & walmsley 1991 ) , however , to date there exist no equivalent models exploring pumping of the observed h@xmath0co 6@xmath2 cm masers via ir photons .",
    "the idea of fir pumping of h@xmath0co masers is compelling ; however a quantitative test of this hypothesis is not practical since ( as mentioned in section 3.2 ) the available data toward the h@xmath0co maser in g23.71@xmath10.20 do not provide sufficient constraints to carry out an analysis of the inversion mechanism .",
    "specifically , the fir fluxes measured by iras toward g23.71@xmath10.20 are likely to trace the extended ir region to the sw of the maser position ( see figure  3 ) and not the fir properties of the compact spitzer source .    in the case of g23.71@xmath10.20",
    ", the other proposed pumping mechanisms can not be currently tested either .",
    "the radio continuum at the position of the maser is blended with emission from two nearby continuum regions , thus neither the gain of the maser or the emission measure of the ionized gas at the maser position can be determined .",
    "in addition , the thermal molecular data ( e.g. , cs ) are insufficient to establish whether the h@xmath0co maser is associated with a molecular clump or outflow , and we also lack high quality information about shock tracers like h@xmath0o masers that may be associated with h@xmath0co masers ( e.g. , araya et al . 2005 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the detection of maser emission in g23.71@xmath10.20 supports the trend that h@xmath0co masers reside very near to massive young stellar objects ( ysos ) , i.e. , closer than a few thousand au .",
    "for example , the maser in g29.96@xmath10.02 is coincident with a hot molecular core ( pratap et al .",
    "1994 ) that probably contains a massive circumstellar disk ( olmi et al .",
    "2003 ) ; the maser in iras@xmath218566 + 0408 is coincident with a 2mass and a bright spitzer / glimpse source ( araya et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 in prep . ) and the central continuum object has been classified as a massive disk candidate ( zhang 2005 ) . also , the maser in ngc@xmath27538 irs1 ( which shows an h@xmath0co ne@xmath1sw velocity gradient , hoffman et al .",
    "2003 ) is located at the position of an hypercompact h@xmath2ii region candidate ( sewilo et al .",
    "2004b ) that harbors a possible circumstellar disk oriented in a ne@xmath1sw direction ( de buizer & minier 2005 ) .",
    "the close association of h@xmath0co masers with massive ysos is in contrast to other molecular masers ( e.g. , 44@xmath2ghz ch@xmath17oh masers , kurtz , hofner , & vargas - lvarez 2004 ) that can be found at larger distances from massive ysos and are probably related to the interaction of jets and outflows with the surrounding material of the molecular cloud .",
    "if the h@xmath0co masers are associated with shocked gas , then they might trace the regions where accretion from a mass reservoir to a massive circumstellar disk occurs .",
    "using the vla in the a configuration we detected h@xmath0co emission from the massive star forming region g23.71@xmath10.20 . based on the brightness temperature limit of the detection ( t@xmath22k ) , the line must be due to a maser mechanism : i.e. , this source is the fifth region in the galaxy where h@xmath0co 6@xmath2 cm maser emission has been detected .",
    "the fwhm of the line is @xmath23 , i.e. , narrower than other h@xmath0co masers detected with the vla .",
    "the maser was independently confirmed by vla - b observations of the region , that were conducted approximately 3 months after the initial detection .",
    "the lsr velocity and position of the maser closely correspond to those of ch@xmath17oh 6.7@xmath2ghz masers detected by walsh et al .",
    "( 1998 ) with the australia telescope compact array .",
    "we found a compact spitzer / irac ir source , possibly a deeply embedded young stellar object , coincident with the h@xmath0co maser .",
