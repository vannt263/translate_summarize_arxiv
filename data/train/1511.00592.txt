    "theories with strong electroweak symmetry breaking are severely constrained by the electroweak precision observables measured at lep , slc and tevatron .",

    "however , while corrections to electroweak observables can be naively estimated to be generally large , their precise determination in the context of strongly - interacting dynamics is a challenge .",

    "especially powerful in this sense is the 5-dimensional perturbative approach of holographic theories , which allows one to effectively resum the corrections of a whole tower of states , the kaluza - klein excitations , neglecting smaller effects from string modes .",
    "an alternative strategy consists in making use of dispersion relations to express an observable as the integral over the spectral functions of the strong dynamics . extracting the spectral functions from experimental data thus leads to a result which is , at least in principle , free from theoretical ambiguities .",

    "although the most powerful use of dispersion relations is in conjunction with experimental data , in the absence of the latter one can make models of the spectral functions based on theoretical considerations .",
