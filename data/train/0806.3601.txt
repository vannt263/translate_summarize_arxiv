    "baryon resonances as three - hadron systems have been also investigated theoretically for systems of @xmath16  @xcite , @xmath17  @xcite and @xmath18  @xcite . based on the idea to regard @xmath6 as a @xmath13 quasi - bound state  @xcite ,",

    "@xcite based on three - body calculation with attractive @xmath20 interactions given by refs .  @xcite . in this system ,",
    "the anti - kaons play unique roles , because they have enough attraction with the nucleon to form a quasi - bound state as @xmath6 and possess so heavy mass to provide small kinetic energy in the @xmath18 system .",
    "the quasi - bound state of @xmath18 has a characteristic structure that one of the anti - kaons forms @xmath6 with the nucleon ( @xmath6-cluster ) as seen also in @xmath21 system  @xcite , and the other anti - kaon spreads for long distance .",
    "this structure is caused by strong @xmath20 attraction with @xmath22 .    in this paper , we explore quasi - bound states of the @xmath23 system with @xmath1 and @xmath24 , assuming that the @xmath20 and @xmath4 systems have enough attractions to form quasi - bound states of @xmath6 in @xmath22 and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) in @xmath22 ( @xmath25 ) , respectively .",

    "if the @xmath27 state is bound with moderate binding energy below all the thresholds of @xmath6+@xmath28 , @xmath14+@xmath29 and @xmath15+@xmath29 , the state is quasi - stable against these decay modes and has comparable decay width with those of the two - particle subsystems . for deeply bound @xmath27 system ,",

    "the @xmath25 configuration is dominant while the @xmath22 component gives minor contribution .",
    "this isospin configuration is caused by the following reason . in both @xmath22 and @xmath25 channels ,",
    "the @xmath4 attraction is strong enough to provide quasi - bound @xmath4 states of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , since these scalar mesons have similar masses and widths , the @xmath4 interactions in @xmath22 and @xmath25 adjusted to these masses and widths are similar to each other .",
    "in fact , we use the same parametrization for the @xmath4 interactions in the present calculation , which gives isospin - blind potential .",
    "therefore , the @xmath20 interaction plays a major role to determine the isospin configuration of the @xmath0 state .",
    "since the @xmath20 interaction has stronger attraction in the @xmath22 channel than in the @xmath25 channel , the system prefers to have @xmath22 in the @xmath13 subsystem .",
    "if the @xmath13 subsystem has pure @xmath22 configuration , which is the case without the @xmath5 repulsion , the @xmath4 subsystem should be composed by @xmath22 and @xmath25 with the ratio of 1:3 to have @xmath1 of @xmath27 .",
    "thus , the @xmath13 with @xmath22 dominates the @xmath27 system , and simultaneously the @xmath4 with @xmath25 is dominant component .",
    "the small deviation from the pure @xmath107 configuration in the @xmath30 state originates in the @xmath5 repulsion .",

    "@xmath40-@xmath29 and @xmath28-@xmath40 distances in the three - body @xmath27 state have values close to those in the quasi - bound two - body states , @xmath78  and @xmath86 , respectively .",

    "@xmath28-@xmath29 distance is relatively larger than the r.m.s .",
    "@xmath40-@xmath29 and @xmath28-@xmath40 distances due to the @xmath5 repulsion .",
    "the effect of the repulsive @xmath5 interaction is important in the present system . without the repulsion , we obtain smaller three - body systems as shown in table  [ tab : radii ] .",
    "especially the distances of the two - body subsystems are as small as about 1.5 fm , which is comparable with the sum of the charge radii of proton ( 0.8 fm ) and @xmath116 ( 0.6  fm ) .",
    "for such a small system , three - body interactions and transitions to two particles could be important .",
    "in addition , the present picture that the system is described in non - relativistic three particles might be broken down , and one would need relativistic treatments and two - body potentials with consideration of internal structures of the constituent hadrons .    combining the discussions of the isospin and spatial structure of the @xmath27 system , we conclude that the structure of the @xmath111 state can be understood simultaneous coexistence of @xmath6 and @xmath15 clusters as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bond ] .",

    "the probabilities for the @xmath23 system to have these states are 90% as seen in table  [ tab : radii ] .",

    "[ fig : bond ]    it is interesting to compare the obtained @xmath111 state with nuclear systems . as shown in table  [ tab : radii ] , the hadron - hadron distances in the @xmath111 state are about 2 fm , which is as large as nucleon - nucleon distances in nuclei . in particular , in the case  ( a ) of the hw - hnjh potential , the hadron - hadron distances are larger than 2 fm and the r.m.s .  radius of the three - body system is also as large as 1.7 fm .",

    "this leads that the @xmath111 quasi - bound system can be interpreted as coexistence state of @xmath6 and @xmath15 clusters and @xmath40 is a constituent of both @xmath6 and @xmath15 at the same time . as a result of this feature ,",
    "the dominant decay modes are @xmath129 from the @xmath6 decay and @xmath130 from the @xmath15 decay , and the decays to @xmath131 and @xmath132 channels are suppressed .",
    "we also have found that the root - mean - square radius of the @xmath27 state is as large as 1.7 fm and the inter - hadron distances are lager than 2 fm .",
    "these values are comparable to , or even larger than , the radius of @xmath133he and typical nucleon - nucleon distances in nuclei , respectively .",
    "therefore , the @xmath27 system more spatially extends compared with typical hadronic systems .",

    "<S> a @xmath0 system with @xmath1 and @xmath2 is investigated with non - relativistic three - body calculations by using effective @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 interaction describes the @xmath6 as a @xmath3 molecule , and the @xmath4 interaction is adjusted to give @xmath7 and @xmath8 states as @xmath4 molecules . </S>",
    "<S> the present investigation suggests that a bound @xmath0 state can be formed below the @xmath0 threshold ( 1930 mev ) with a @xmath9 mev width of three - hadron decays , which are dominated by @xmath10 and @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the @xmath0 state is a weakly bound hadron molecular state with a size larger than an @xmath12 particle because of the repulsive @xmath5 interactions . </S>"
