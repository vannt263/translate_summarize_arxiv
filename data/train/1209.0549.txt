    "the multiobjective optimization problem ( moop ) is to optimize two or more objective functions simultaneously , subject to given constraints .",
    "the multiobjective optimization can be applied to problems where the final decision should be made considering two or more conflicting objectives .",
    "moop occurs in various fields such as industrial design , finance , management and many engineering areas .",
    "practical goals in these fields can be generalized in such a way that the cost of a process is minimized while the quality of its product is maximized .",
    "the primary goal is to find a set of solutions that any individual objective function can not be improved without deteriorating the other objective functions , and such a set is called a pareto set . for efficient decision making ,",
    "a set of generated solutions ( @xmath0 ) should meet two conditions : it should be as close to the pareto front as possible and the solutions should be distributed as widely as possible",
    ".    evolutionary algorithm ( ea ) is one of the most popular and successful approaches to solve moops  @xcite .",
    "a number of ea - based algorithms have been suggested including the vector evaluated genetic algorithm ( vega )  @xcite , the niched pareto genetic algorithm ( npga )  @xcite , the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ( nsga2 )  @xcite , the strength pareto evolutionary algorithm ( spea2 )  @xcite , the mimetic pareto archived evolution strategy ( m - paes )  @xcite and micro genetic algorithm ( micro - ga )  @xcite . among them ,",
    "nsga2 and spea2 are arguably the most widely used methods .",
    "other approaches include simulated annealing ( sa )  @xcite , tabu search  @xcite , particle swarm optimization ( pso )  @xcite , immune algorithm ( ia )  @xcite , ant system  @xcite and cultural algorithm  @xcite .",
    "conformational space annealing ( csa ) is a highly efficient single - objective global optimization algorithm which incorporates advantages of genetic algorithm and sa .",
    "it has been successfully applied to diverse single - objective optimization problems in physics and biology , such as protein structure modeling  @xcite , finding the minimum energy solution of a lenard - jones cluster  @xcite , multiple sequence alignment  @xcite and the community detection problem  @xcite on networks . in these studies",
    ", csa is shown to perform more efficient sampling using less computational resources than the conventional monte - carlo ( mc ) and sa methods .    here , we introduce a new multiobjective optimization algorithm by using csa , mocsa .",
    "compared to existing eas , mocsa has the following distinct features : ( a ) the ranking system considers the dominance relationship and the distance between solutions in the objective space , ( b ) solutions are updated by using a dynamically varying distance cutoff measure to control the diversity of the sampling in the decision space , and ( c ) a gradient - based constrained minimizer is utilized for local search .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the definition of moop and related terms are described . in section 3 , details of mocsa",
    "is presented .",
    "numerical results and the comparison between mocsa and nsga2 on various test problems are presented in section 4 .",
    "the final section contains the conclusion .",
    "the mathematical definition of a moop can be defined as follows , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the decision vector , @xmath3 the decision space , @xmath4 the objective vector and @xmath5 the objective space .",
    "due to the presence of multiple objective functions , a final solution of moop consists of a set of non - dominated solutions instead of a single point .",
    "the notion of _ dominance _ and related terms are defined below .    a decision vector @xmath6 is said to dominate another solution @xmath7 ( denoted by @xmath8 ) , if and only if @xmath9    [ paretodominance]definition    a solution @xmath2 is said to be non - dominated by any other solutions ( a pareto optimal solution ) if and only if @xmath10    [ paretodominance]definition    for a given moop , a pareto optimal set in the decision space , @xmath11 , is defined as @xmath12    [ paretodominance]definition    for a given moop , a pareto optimal set in the objective space , @xmath13 , is defined as @xmath14    since the size of pareto optimal front , @xmath13 is infinite in general , which is impossible to obtain in practice , practical algorithms for moop yield a set of non - dominated solutions of a finite size .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath13 is always a non - dominated set by definition while a non - dominated set of solutions generated by an algorithm , which is denoted as a @xmath0 , may not be a subset of @xmath13 .",
    "here , a new multiobjective optimization algorithm based on csa is described .",
    "the csa was initially developed to obtain the protein structure with the minimum potential energy , _",
    "i.e. _ , to solve a single objective optimization problem .",
    "csa has been successfully applied to various kinds of optimization problems with modification .",
    "the general framework of csa is shown in figure  [ csa_flow_chart ] , and the description of mocsa is given in algorithm  [ csa ] .",

    ", we use a set of @xmath16 solutions ( called _ bank _ in csa , denoted as @xmath15 ) collectively , and we generate offsprings from the bank solutions by cross - over and mutation . finally , as in sa",
    ", we introduce a distance parameter @xmath19 , which plays the role of the temperature in sa . in csa , each solution is assumed to represent a hyper - sphere of radius @xmath38 in the decision space .",
    "diversity of sampling is directly controlled by introducing a distance measure between two solutions and comparing it with @xmath19 , to prevent two solutions from approaching too close to each other in the decision space .",
    "similar to the manipulation of temperature in sa , the value of @xmath19 is initially set to a large value and is slowly reduced to a smaller value in csa ; hence the name conformational space annealing .",
    "compared to the conventional ea for multiobjective problems , mocsa has three distinct features ; ( a ) a ranking algorithm which considers the dominance relationship as well as the distance between solutions in the objective space , ( b ) an update rule with a dynamically varying distance cutoff measure to control the size of search space and to keep the diversity of sampling in the decision space and ( c ) the usage of a gradient - based constrained minimizer , feasible sequential quadratic programming ( fsqp ) , for local search . in csa , we first initialize the _ bank _ , @xmath15 , with @xmath39 random solutions which are subsequently minimized by fsqp constrained minimizer .",
    "the solutions in the bank are updated using subsequent solutions found during the course of optimization .",
    "the initial value of @xmath19 is set as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the average distance in the _ decision _ space between two solutions at the initial stage .",
    "a number of solutions ( 20 in this study ) in the bank are selected as _",
    "seeds_. for each seed , 30 trial solutions are generated by cross - over between the seed and randomly chosen solutions from the bank .",
    "additional 5 are generated by mutation of the seed .",
    "it should be noted that if a solution is used as a seed and not replaced by a offspring , it is excluded from the subsequent seed selection .",
    "the generated offsprings are locally minimized by fsqp which guarantees to improve a subset of objective functions without deteriorating the others and without violating given constraints . to limit the computational usage",
    ", the minimization is performed only once per every five generation steps ( see algorithm  [ csa ] ) .",
    "offsprings are used to update the bank , and detailed description on the updating rule is provided in section  [ sec : update ] .",
    "once all solutions in the bank are used as seeds without generating better solutions , implying that the procedure might have reached a deadlock , we reset all bank solutions to be eligible for seeds again and repeat another round of the search procedure . after this additional search reaches a deadlock again ,",
    "we expand our search space by adding additional 50 randomly generated and minimized solutions to the bank ( @xmath42 ) , and repeat the whole procedure until a termination criterion is satisfied .",
    "the maximum number of generation is set to @xmath43 .",
    "typically , with @xmath44 in this study , mocsa is terminated before a deadlock occurs with the final bank size of @xmath39 .       for a given set of generated solutions , @xmath0 , the fitness of solution @xmath45",

    "@xmath48 is the sum of distances from @xmath45 to its nearest and second nearest neighbors in @xmath0 in the objective space .",
    "the relative fitness between two solutions , @xmath45 and @xmath49 , is determined by the comparing function shown in algorithm  [ fitness ] . with a set of non - dominated solutions",
    "all values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 become zeros and the solution with the least value of @xmath50 is considered as the worst .       the solutions generated by crossover and mutation",
    "are locally minimized by fsqp constrained minimizer and we call them trial solutions . each trial solution @xmath51 ,",
    "is compared with the bank @xmath15 for update procedure as shown in algorithm  [ update ] .",
    "first , @xmath52 , the closest solution in @xmath15 from @xmath51 in the _ decision _ space is identified .",
