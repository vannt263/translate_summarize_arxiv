    "many characteristics of neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries are attributed to the interaction of the star s magnetic field with a flow of dense accreting plasma , supplied by the companion via roche - lobe overflow .",
    "these features include magnetically channeled accretion leading to pulsed x - ray emission , relativistic radio jets , and spin - up of the neutron star to nearly kilohertz frequencies .",
    "as much of the energy and angular momentum transfer is mediated by magnetic fields , the form taken by the global magnetic geometry has far - reaching consequences .",
    "theories of magnetic star ",
    "disc systems can be roughly divided into those in which the field remains approximately dipolar , leading to extensive magnetic coupling between the stellar surface and the disc @xcite , those in which the field is excluded from the disc by surface currents @xcite , and models in which most of the stellar flux that would enter the disc is opened , breaking the star ",
    "disk connection @xcite .",
    "this flux opening is a direct result of the angular velocity mismatch that generally exists between the footpoint of a field line on the star and where it enters the disc @xcite , and may be responsible for observed flaring activity via magnetic reconnection in the ensuing current sheet @xcite .    stressed ( i.e. twisted ) field lines which link the star and the disc allow angular momentum to be exchanged between them , acting to increase the star s rotation rate when the field line enters the disc inside the corotation radius , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the star s mass and spin angular frequency , and applying a braking torque on the star if it enters beyond this point . how field lines respond to these stresses",
    "depends on the effective magnetic diffusivity in the disc , provided by the magnetorotational turbulence .",
    "when the diffusivity is high , field lines move outward through the disc @xcite , reducing the torque that they apply to the star @xcite .",
    "if the diffusivity is low , the stressed field lines are opened to infinity , and the star ",
    "disc torques they carried are replaced by an outflow of angular momentum from both the star and the disc material , carried by their individual rotationally driven magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) winds @xcite .",
    "the strength of the star s mhd wind is determined by its rotation rate , magnetic field strength , and the outflowing inertia threaded by the field . in the nonrelativistic limit",
    "this last component is the wind s mass loading , and so for systems like accreting protostars the open field lines must be continuously supplied with sufficient matter if they are to exert a significant torque on the star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , millisecond pulsars have spin frequencies of several hundred hertz and surface magnetic field strengths of roughly @xmath4  g , and so the torque applied by the relativistic pulsar wind , in which the inertia in question is the effective inertia of the electromagnetic field itself , can be significant .    in ( * ? ? ? *",
    "henceforth paper i ) we described estimates of the spin - down torque due to the relativistic pulsar wind , when the amount of open stellar flux has been increased by interaction with the disc via the process described above ; see also section  [ sec : model ] . for rapidly rotating pulsars this enhanced wind torque can be of the order of the estimated spin - up torque from accreting material , and for efficient field opening it can be strong enough to enforce spin equilibrium at frequencies less than 1 khz for reasonable stellar magnetic field strengths and accretion rates .",
    "estimates of the energy flux on the open field lines suggest that the enhanced pulsar wind could be responsible for even the most extreme relativistic jets from neutron star systems , if the electromagnetic outflow is collimated by an external agent , for example an mhd wind from the outer accretion disc . in this work we present the results of simulations which directly test the model of paper i , in particular the efficiency of flux opening and the relative importance of open and disc - coupling flux in determining the stellar spin - down torque .",
    "mhd simulations of the star ",
    "disc system allow the global magnetic field and gas flow to be evolved self - consistently , including the reaction of the stellar field on the disc .",
    "simulations of this kind have displayed a wide range of behaviours in different regimes , including ejections of plasmoids and magnetic braking of the inner disc @xcite , quasi - periodic opening and reconnection of flux coupling the star and disc @xcite , funnel flows of accreting gas @xcite , the launching of powerful jets by magnetic towers @xcite , and ` propellering ' of gas against gravity by rapid rotators @xcite .",
    "coupling of the stellar field to the disc out to large radii was observed when the disc magnetic diffusivity was high @xcite .",
    "simulations have been performed in which the disc effective viscosity and magnetic diffusivity were determined by the self - consistent evolution of the magnetorotational instability ( mri ; * ? ? ?",
    "as an alternative to evolving both the disc and its corona in the same domain , some simulations have incorporated the disc as a boundary condition ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    here",
    "we take a different , in some ways simplified , approach .",
    "we evolve the magnetically dominated region , the magnetosphere or corona , using relativistic force - free electrodynamics , the high - magnetisation limit of mhd @xcite , supplemented with small resistive corrections .",
    "the electromagnetic fields are also evolved inside the disc volume , which is modeled as a conducting fluid with an imposed velocity field and conductivity profile .",
    "this method has two principal advantages .",
    "firstly , it allows the magnetosphere to be evolved with zero mass loading , in which all the inertia comes from the electromagnetic field itself . for open field lines ,",
    "this gives the minimal possible magnetic stresses  any spin - down torque communicated by the open flux must be at least as large as in the force - free case , provided enough charge carriers are present to supply the currents .",
    "the coronae of fairly thin or slim discs in particular are expected to have very low mass density due to the small disc scale - height , and so to be highly magnetically dominated .",
    "this regime is problematic for simulations using the full mhd equations , which require a density floor for numerical stability .",
    "secondly , because the disc is imposed artificially as part of the problem specificiation , this approach permits a wide - ranging investigation of how the star  disc magnetosphere depends on various disc properties , such as thickness , conductivity , and the radial accretion velocity .    in our simulations",
    "the only magnetic field is the stellar dipole . in effect",
    ", we assume that the disc s magnetic field is present exclusively at small scales , where it generates mri turbulence and hence the accretion velocity and effective disc conductivity that we specify ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in reality",
    "the disc s field may well mediate the coupling between stellar field and disc through reconnection near the disc s surface ; this will not appreciably change any of our conclusions .",
    "we begin by briefly summarising in section  [ sec : model ] the enhanced pulsar wind model of paper i. the numerical method and simulation procedure is described in detail in section  [ sec : method ] .",
    "the magnetosphere of an isolated pulsar has a region of approximately dipolar closed field lines within the light cylinder defined by its rotation , @xmath5 and beyond which all field lines are open ; @xmath3 is the star s spin angular frequency .",
    "the pulsar wind power @xmath6 and the torque exerted by the magnetosphere on the star @xmath7 are given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the star s magnetic moment and @xmath10 is the amount of open flux @xcite ; throughout we use a subscripted ` 0 ' to indicate quantities referring to an isolated pulsar . in paper",
    "i we described a simple analytical model in which a surrounding disc , inside the light cylinder , opens some of the closed flux via the above mechanism , causing the amount of open flux @xmath11 to increase , @xmath12 where we have assumed a dipolar dependence of the poloidal flux function @xmath13 on radius in the closed zone : @xmath14 at the equator ; here the magnetospheric radius @xmath15 is the inner truncation radius of the disc , and @xmath16 parameterises the flux - opening efficiency .",
    "the poloidal flux function is defined as @xmath17 when we give numerical values of @xmath13 , we normalise such that @xmath18 ( i.e. the dipole field is given by @xmath19 ) .    because the spin - down power and torque simply scale quadratically with the open flux , straightforward estimates can be made , @xmath20 where",
    "we have associated the spin - down power on the open field lines with the system s jet power , @xmath21 .",
    "if the disc conductivity is high we expect most field lines to be open and @xmath22 to be a good estimate of the total spin - down torque on the star  this proposal is tested in section  [ sec : simsgrid ] .",
    "all one now needs to make estimates of the strength of the open - flux torque and electromagnetic jet power is a model for the disc truncation radius . in paper",
    "i we used @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the standard estimate of the alfvn radius assuming spherical accretion .",
    "mhd simulations have usually found @xmath25@xmath26 @xcite .",

    "we divide the space outside the star into two regions : the disc and the magnetosphere .",
    "we solve maxwell s equations in the complete domain using the pseudospectral code phaedra @xcite , subject to each region s appropriate current density @xmath34 .",
    "we take the magnetosphere to be magnetically dominated , and use a resistive extension of the force - free current density , @xmath35 where the denominator in the @xmath36 drift current is defined via @xcite , @xmath37    here @xmath38 is the resistivity and @xmath39 is a driving rate : @xmath40 is driven to @xmath41 over a time @xmath42 .",
    "this form of resistivity only dissipates currents along the magnetic field , so alfvn waves are dissipated but fast magnetosonic waves are unaffected . as @xmath43 , ideal force - free electrodynamics is recovered , in which @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the charge density .",
    "here we use a very small @xmath38 in the magnetosphere , so that relaxation of twisted field lines , and the triggering of reconnection in current sheets , is due to physically modeled dissipative electric fields rather than the numerical dissipation intrinsic to the simulations .",
    "the resistivity is modeled with a constant background and a current - dependent term which only becomes appreciable in current sheets , @xmath47 and a maximum value of @xmath48 is enforced ; @xmath49 is the usual ideal force - free current , i.e equation  ( [ eq : jffe ] ) with @xmath38 and @xmath39 set to zero . unless specified otherwise , we use @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "the magnetospheric background conductivity , @xmath53 , is about two orders of magnitude larger than our highest disc conductivity . the driving rate @xmath39 is chosen at each point to be the instantaneous maximum numerically stable value .    a significant problem when evolving the force - free equations , ideal or resistive , is the spontaneous appearance of regions where @xmath54 , implying the breakdown of the assumptions on which the system of equations is based .",
    "this usually occurs during current sheet formation , and is accompanied by numerical instability . here",
    "we use a ` current sheet capturing ' method to find these pathological regions between grid points , and smoothly remove electric field from the immediate vicinity such that current sheets do not collapse to the grid scale and stability is maintained .",
    "the resistive force - free equations and current sheet capturing method will be described in detail in a future paper ( parfrey 2016 , in preparation ) .",
    "the disc region is defined by its boundary curve , which we take in most cases to be a parabola , @xmath55 where @xmath56 are the cylindrical radius and height , and @xmath57 sets the disc thickness . inside the disc , the current density",

    "in this region the accreting plasma s angular momentum is transferred to the star via the ` pulling forward ' of the star s magnetic field lines .",
    "the transitional region at the funnel s base in the disc is neither strongly magnetically dominated nor matter dominated , and so can not be directly captured in our force - free simulations .",
    "we simply omit the accretion funnel from the simulations , on the grounds that the behaviour of the accretion stream should not significantly affect the quantity in which we are most interested , the spin - down torque applied by open field lines , if the disc is truncated well inside the corotation radius .",
    "one can take our disc truncation radius @xmath15 as the innermost point at which the accretion flow is close to keplerian ; inside @xmath15 the funnel flow begins and the star s magnetic field brings the gas to corotation .",

    "as the apices of the expanding field lines move outwards at nearly the speed of light , their footpoints on the star and disc can no longer communicate via alfvn waves .",

    "there is also a small amount of closed flux which continues to couple the inner disc to the star , but here its spin - up contribution to the torque is only roughly a third of the spin - down torque applied by the much larger bundle of open field lines .    eventually the current sheet becomes unstable to tearing - mode reconnection , and some of the open flux reconnects , producing a hierarchy of plasmoids which are ejected from the system , fig .",

    "the first reconnection event begins at @xmath121 .",
    "the newly closed field lines , once again joining the star to the disc , are immediately subject to rapid twisting and begin to re - inflate , leading to a quasi - periodic cycle of flux inflation and reconnection , fig .",
    "[ fig : multipaneltime](d ) .",
    "the stellar torque oscillates sharply over one of these cycles , with the spin - down torque being largest , and the spin - up contribution smallest , just before reconnection .    at all times , the disc s open poloidal field lines enter in a pushed - forward , ` @xmath122'-like configuration due to magnetic pressure balance .",
    "sequences of quasi - static twisted force - free equilibria expand at an angle of @xmath123 to the vertical @xcite .",
    "when the toroidal field on the disc s open flux is much less than that on the stellar flux , one can think of the disc field as being pushed forward by the pulsar wind , which would otherwise become nearly radial .",
    "the consequence is that , when radial field of opposite signs annihilates across the disc due to its finite conductivity , there is a slow drift outwards of the points at which the field lines enter the disc ; see section  [ sec : expulsion ] for details . in this simulation",
    "the resistive drift velocity is larger than the radial accretion velocity , and the disc s flux is gradually expelled from the system , fig .",
    "[ fig : multipaneltime](c)(f ) .",
    "a small amount of flux remains trapped in the disc near the corotation radius , where the shear between star and disc is small .",
    "however the disc has opened most of the field lines which initially entered it inside @xmath69 , and expelled their disc footpoints to large radii ; the trapped flux originally entered near the disc s inner edge .",
    "by @xmath124 most of the disc s open flux has been expelled through the light cylinder , and the inner magnetosphere has settled into a quasi - steady state .",
    "the opening and reconnection cycles of the remaining star  disc coupling field continue , causing the torques to oscillate , though with the spin - down torque being always greater than the spin - up torque .",

    "the behaviour when the disc s radial accretion velocity @xmath126 is set to zero ( simulation noadv1 ) is similar , indicating that for this @xmath0-disc model accretion is too slow to have much effect .",
    "the disc s open flux is expelled outwards slightly faster , and some of the torque oscillations are not as pronounced [ see the dashed blue and grey lines in fig .

    "most of the poloidal flux is concentrated near the corotation radius ; depending on the phase of the reconnection cycle , there can be more flux entering the disc inside or outside corotation ( the flux through the equator between any two radii is given by the difference in @xmath13 between them ) .",
    "we can estimate the outward resistive drift velocity of the field lines , following @xcite .",
    "working in cylindrical coordinates , the non - ideal terms in the induction equation for the vertical magnetic field are given by @xmath128 , where @xmath99 is the magnetic diffusivity ; the first term corresponds to radial diffusion of @xmath129 , the second to change of @xmath129 due to vertical annihilation of @xmath130 .",
    "the annihilation term should dominate as long as the disc height @xmath88 is the smallest length scale available , in which case the radial drift speed is @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the angle to the vertical at which the field enters the disc .",
    "equivalently , one can think of the field lines as diffusing outwards with the speed of diffusion across the disc , @xmath133 , times the geometric factor which converts this vertical diffusion into apparent radial movement , @xmath134 .",
    "the magnetic diffusivity can be expressed as @xmath135 , and so @xmath136 .",
    "the radial accretion speed is given by @xmath137 , so their ratio is @xmath138 since in the simulations the open field lines enter the disc with @xmath139 and we expect @xmath140 , the competing radial speeds are simply related by @xmath141 .",
    "outward expulsion of the field lines should easily overcome the radial accretion flow for thin discs , as is seen in the simulation described above , and the two should be of roughly equal strength for thicker discs , where the @xmath0-disc model in any case ceases to be a reliable approximation .",
    "the specification of the r2 simulation is identical to the r1 run described above , except with a shakura - sunyaev @xmath0 parameter four times larger , which reduces the disc s conductivity , and increases its radial accretion velocity , by a factor of four ( see table  [ tab : reference ] ) .",

    "[ fig : torqueovertime](b ) .",
    "the early phases are very similar to the r1 simulation , but after several phases of opening and reconnection the inner magnetosphere reaches a steady state and the spin - up torque , caused by field lines entering the disc inside @xmath69 , becomes constant .",
    "the open field lines rooted in the disc are slowly expelled outwards , and the spin - down torque on the star declines as the stellar open field lines relax toward their final nearly radial configuration .",
    "the poloidal deflection of the stellar field lines by the disc s magnetic field only slightly increases the power extracted in the pulsar wind .",
    "the innermost open field line attached to the disc moves through the light cylinder at @xmath142 , and exits the computational domain at @xmath143 , at which time spin - down torque also becomes constant and the entire magnetosphere settles into a steady state .",
    "the final spin - down torque is about @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is the torque on an isolated pulsar of the same rotation rate ; it is roughly 17% larger when the inner magnetosphere becomes approximately steady , at @xmath146 .    in this simulation ,",
    "the final relative strengths of the spin - up and spin - down contributions to the stellar torque have been reversed when compared to r1 .",
    "the lower disc conductivity has allowed more field lines to remain closed in the disc , especially inside @xmath69 , which has increased the spin - up torque and decreased the spin - down torque .",
    "the radial accretion velocity is unimportant in this simulation , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : torqueovertime](b ) , where the dashed lines of the @xmath147 run ( noadv2 ) lie very close to the solid lines of r2 throughout .    the flux function distribution in the disc for the r2 run s final steady state is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ffalpha](a ) . as one would expect , more flux threads the disc when its diffusivity is increased .",
    "this is true particularly inside corotation , while the flux threading the outer disc does not change as dramatically .",
    "the region around @xmath69 in which the poloidal flux is concentrated has broadened in comparison to the lower diffusivity r1 simulation .",
    "the final @xmath0-disc pair , r3 and noadv3 , were performed to investigate the behaviour of pulsar magnetospheres coupled to hotter , partially pressure supported , discs . here",
    "the assumptions underlying the standard @xmath0-disc model do not apply , but it usefully allows a straightforward comparison with the thin - disc simulations , and reflects the more important features of thick discs for our purposes : the accretion velocity increases and the conductivity decreases as the disc becomes thicker .",
    "the r3 simulation has @xmath114 , as in r1 , but the disc is four times thicker , and so @xmath126 and @xmath61 are , respectively , sixteen times larger and smaller .",
    "the reference run , r3 , behaves in many respects like our fiducial simulation r1 : the disc s open field lines are gradually driven outward , eventually well beyond the light cylinder , but opening and reconnection of those field lines entering the inner disc continues indefinitely .",
    "the stellar torques undergo large oscillations due to the opening and reconnection cycle , whose maintenance requires radial accretion in the disc ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : torqueovertime](c ) . when the radial velocity is removed in run noadv3 ,",
    "the inner disc settles into equilibrium , the spin - up torque becomes nearly constant , and the spin - down torque decreases slowly as in run r2 .",
    "these two outcomes are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : thickdisc ] .    without the accretion velocity ,",
    "the spin - up torque remains close to the highest points of the full model s spin - up oscillations , and the spin - down torque stays near the lowest points of the corresponding variations .",
    "this is because the oscillations are primarily caused by the opening of field lines coupling to the disc inside corotation , as can be seen in fig .",

    "therefore the opening of this flux , due to the presence of the disc radial velocity in the full model , decreases the spin - up torque in comparison with the model without disc radial advection ( fewer field lines dragging the star forwards ) and similarly increases the spin - down torque ( stronger pulsar wind from larger stellar open flux ) .",
    "the thick disc s lower conductivity allows more field lines to remain closed inside @xmath69 , diffusing azimuthally through the disc material , and the spin - up torque is higher than in the simulations with thinner discs .    the poloidal flux through these thick discs is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ffalpha](b ) .",
    "the inner plateau of @xmath13 is now much less evident , with the stellar magnetic field being distributed more evenly through the disc due to its reduced conductivity ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the opening and reconnection cycle is visible in the clustering of the r3 simulation s lines into several distinct bands .",
    "the total open flux is less than in the simulations with thinner , less diffusive , discs , but not dramatically so .",
    "when the accretion velocity is removed ( noadv3 ) , in the inner disc the equatorial flux distribution lies within the range of excursion of the full simulation over its opening cycle .",
    "further out , the opening events from the inner disc in the r3 simulation allow more field lines to remain open in the quasi - steady state , since their relaxation time is longer than the opening cycle ; this accounts for the reduced flux through the disc in the r3 simulation , compared to noadv3 , during all phases of the opening cycle for @xmath148 .",
    "to investigate systematically the relationship between open flux and spin - down torque , we performed a grid of thirty - two simulations having the same disc profile but where the magnetospheric radius was placed at eight locations from @xmath14914 @xmath110 , and the disc conductivity was set in each case to one of four constant values , @xmath150 [ 400 , 800 , 1200 , 1600 ] @xmath151 .",
    "the light cylinder is at @xmath107 as in section  [ sec : simsalpha ] , and so @xmath152",
    ".    we chose the same thin disc profile for every simulation , having @xmath153 , which is half as thick as the disc in section  [ sec : simsalpha ] s r1 and r2 .",
    "the thinner profile increases the rate of magnetic annihilation across the disc , and so all the simulations settle eventually into stable equilibria in the manner of simulation r2 above , even at the highest conductivity ; this is beneficial as the steady states yield clean measurements for all the quantities of interest . for this disc thickness , the conductivities used roughly correspond to @xmath0 parameters of @xmath154 [ 1.8 , 0.9 , 0.6 , 0.45 ] .",
    "the radial accretion velocity is comparatively unimportant for these thin discs , and so we have set it to zero , leaving only keplerian rotation in the imposed velocity field .",
    "we also ran an isolated puslar simulation with the same stellar rotation rate , from whose final steady state we extracted the poloidal flux function at the equator , @xmath155 , and the total amount of open flux , @xmath10 .",
    "two of the final steady states , with the disc well inside and just outside the corotation radius , are shown in fig .",

    "the open flux has converged , or is close to convergence , as the disc conductivity is increased for all but the innermost truncation radii .",
    "the curve kinks slightly when @xmath15 is just inside @xmath69 , where the small amount of strongly twisted flux inside @xmath69 has difficulty opening flux due to the enclosing weakly sheared field lines ; this effect becomes less important as @xmath15 decreases and the amount of flux entering the disc inside @xmath69 increases .",
    "the simplest model , @xmath159 , is a decent approximation to the open flux for @xmath160 , and equation  ( [ eq : ffopensim ] ) remains good for all magnetospheric radii , especially considering that the closest @xmath15 to the stellar surface hasnt fully converged in @xmath61 . in other words , the disc can efficiently open field lines even when it is truncated significantly inside the corotation radius .    the total spin - down torque on the pulsar @xmath161 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : torque ] , together with the equivalent models , found by relating the open flux spin - down torque to the open flux via @xmath162 . here",
    "the models provide an even better fit to the data , because the small amount of stellar flux closed beyond @xmath69 provides enough spin - down torque to make up for the shortfall in opening efficiency .",
    "this is possible because a given field line supplies less torque when open than when closed ( except when the closed field line enters the disc very close to @xmath69 ) . for these disc parameters",
    ", @xmath163 appears to be a good model for the total spin - down torque on the pulsar .",
    "most of the angular momentum is extracted by the open field lines , and the ratio of open flux torque @xmath22 to total spin - down torque @xmath161 increases with increasing disc conductivity ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : torqueopen ] .",
    "in general , one might expect that this model will provide an over - estimate of @xmath22 , because in reality all of the flux outside @xmath15 will not be opened ( @xmath16 will be less than unity ) , and an underestimate of @xmath161 , because fig .",
    "[ fig : torque ] shows that @xmath161 increases with disc conductivity , and even at the unrealistically low conductivities of our simulations the total spin - down torque already slightly exceeds the model in many cases .",

    "we have performed a suite of simulations in which a relativistic force - free pulsar magnetosphere is coupled to an mhd disc with a fixed velocity field , and finite thickness and conductivity .",
    "this approach allows us to study the pulsar ",
    "disc corona in the highly magnetically dominated limit , and with very low intrinsic numerical dissipation .",
    "we have used two prescriptions for the disc properties : ( 1 ) a disc model in which the accretion velocity , conductivity , and disc thickness are self - consistent with a specified shakura - sunyaev @xmath0 parameter , and ( 2 ) a simpler thin disc configuration with constant conductivity .",
    "we have found two classes of solutions : ( 1 ) those in which no true steady state is reached , and where opening and reconnection of the pulsar s magnetic field continues indefinitely , and ( 2 ) those which settle eventually into a steady state .",
    "whether a steady state is reached can be determined by the disc s conductivity ( more diffusive discs settle more easily into equilibrium ) , and can be dependent on the presence of the radial accretion velocity , at least for thicker discs where this velocity is larger .    the torque on the star , mediated by its magnetic field and caused both by its rotation and its interaction with the accretion flow , is a useful diagnostic .",
    "we find that increasing the disc conductivity causes more of the star s magnetic field to open to infinity , increasing the spin - down torque on the star , and decreasing the spin - up torque .",
    "increasing the disc s thickness at constant @xmath0 parameter increases the spin - down contribution , and appears to have little effect on the spin - up torque .",
    "field line opening has long been assumed to be efficient for cold , thin , high - condutivity discs .",
    "here we show that most of the star ",
    "disc coupling flux opens also in the case of moderately slim , fairly diffusive discs ( i.e. @xmath167 ) , and for thick discs .",
    "the spin - down torque on open field lines is only weakly dependent on their poloidal arrangement , whether they are collimated by the disc s magnetic field into a jet or have relaxed into a nearly radial geometry . in our simulations the disc s open magnetic field",
    "is gradually expelled outwards , since the ratio of the accretion velocity to the resistive drift due to magnetic annihilation in the disc is @xmath141 ( see equation  [ eq : expulsionspeed ] ) . the insensitivity of the spin - down torque to the flux distribution in the poloidal plane allows a simple , widely applicable , estimate to be made via the close correspondance between the relaxed , nearly monopolar state and the isolated pulsar magnetosphere . for a given spin frequency ,",
    "the open flux spin - down torque is determined almost solely by the number of open field lines , allowing it to be estimated as in equation  ( [ eq : torquemodel ] ) .",
    "this relationship was used in paper i to construct a simple torque model for millisecond pulsars surrounded by discs .",
    "if one assumes that flux opening is efficient , and therefore that ( 1 ) all of the spin - down torque is applied by open field lines , and ( 2 ) the spin - up torque is dominated by the accretion torque , @xmath70 , one can estimate the total torque on the star as      note that the @xmath31 spin - up torque is necessarily absent from our simulations , which do not include the accretion funnel inside @xmath15 .",
    "the spin - up torque we measure is that due to field lines coupling the star to the keplerian disc between @xmath15 and @xmath69 .    looking beyond stellar torques",
    ", one can estimate the star s potential jet power by associating the electromagnetic pulsar wind with an observable radio jet , as in equation  ( [ eq : jetmodel ] ) .",
    "for the enhanced pulsar wind to form a jet , it would need to be collimated by an external source of pressure , for example a disc wind .",
    "we do not describe separate diagnostics of the jet power in our simulations , as the angular momentum and energy fluxes are here simply related by a factor of @xmath3 .",
    "we find that the torque and jet power models of equations  ( [ eq : torquemodel ] ) and ( [ eq : jetmodel ] ) provide a good description of our simulations , and that the agreement improves with increasing disc conductivity . in the simulations ,",
    "the spin - down torque is applied primarily by open field lines , whose share of the total spin - down torque also increases as conductivity increases .    in paper",
    "i , we argued that in the case of efficient flux opening , @xmath169 , the enhanced pulsar wind could dominate the spin - down torque on rapidly rotating accreting pulsars , and that the power extracted by the increased open flux would be sufficient to account for the relativistic jets from neutron star x - ray binaries .",
    "we find that the opening efficiency in the simulations is indeed close to unity , even when the disc is more diffusive than realistically expected . in our constant conductivity",
    "thin disc runs , we find the effective @xmath16 to be @xmath170 when the disc extends inside the corotation radius , and @xmath171 if it is truncated beyond corotation . in our @xmath0-disc reference simulations ,",
    "the @xmath16 parameter is @xmath172 for run r1 ( @xmath114 ) , and @xmath173 for r2 ( @xmath174 ) and r3 ( @xmath114 , thicker disc ) .",
    "these values are found via @xmath165 where @xmath161 is the total spin - down torque on the star , implying that our open flux model provides a reasonable estimate for comparison to observations .",
    "our simulations indicate that , in the quasi - steady state , the frequency and amplitude of the torque oscillations depend on the properties of the disc , when the stellar rotation rate and the disc s inner radius remain constant . for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : torqueovertime ] shows that the oscillations occur at higher frequency in the case of the thicker disc , at the same @xmath0 parameter . while short timescale variations in the derivative of the spin frequency may be very challenging to detect during accretion episodes , the high - energy emission from the magnetic reconnection which accompanies the oscillations",
    "may leave an imprint on the system s x - ray variability spectrum .",
    "we defer an exploration of this effect to future work .    in the simulations described here the disc s location is fixed and the initial magnetic field is a potential dipole frozen into the star .",
    "we have also performed simulations in which an isolated pulsar magnetosphere is first formed , and the disc is then moved inwards from beyond the light cylinder . for the ranges of parameters discussed above ,",
    "the same steady or quasi - steady states are eventually reached , once the inwardly pinched field lines have diffused back through the disc .",
    "if the accretion velocity is larger than the outward resistive annihilation velocity ( i.e.  the effective magnetic prandtl number in the disc is greater than @xmath175 ) the inwardly pinched field lines may be trapped in the inner part of the disc ; solutions of this kind will be described in a future paper .",
    "there are several important aspects of the pulsar ",
    "disc problem which are absent from our simulations .",
    "the disc has been included in a simplified manner rather than self - consistently , and so , for example , the dependence of the accretion rate on the disc s local large - scale magnetic field is not captured .",
    "the simulations are axisymmetric , and therefore lack the azimuthally dependent field opening resulting from obliquity between the spin and magnetic axes .",
    "obliquity can be expected to modify our torque and jet power estimates , since a given disc profile will intersect a different bundle of field lines as the obliquity is varied .",
    "we have assumed a corona with vanishing inertia , but as the disc becomes thicker the density throughout the corona should increase , which may impede field line opening but cause more torque to be applied per open field line .",
