    "the models are both mathematically and physically relevant for example , ( pseudo-)riemannian manifolds are of great geometrical interest and a classical solution of such models is simply a harmonic map into such a space @xcite .",
    "further , the heisenberg model has been shown to be gauge equivalent to non - linear schrdinger equations of attractive ( in the compact case ) @xcite and repulsive ( for a non - compact field space ) @xcite types , whilst a reduction of the @xmath0 non - compact sigma model is gauge equivalent to the liouville equation @xcite .",
    "physically , the heisenberg model describes , in the compact case for example , the classical spin @xmath1 distributed along the line , i.e. the 1-dimensional continuous ferromagnet . and the sigma models on non - compact manifolds have arisen in relativistic string theory , see for example @xcite , and gravitation @xcite .    in what follows ,",
    "the discussion of solutions classified by an integer winding number of the hyperbolic ( 1 + 1)-dimensional heisenberg ( hhm ) and sigma ( hsm ) models begun in @xcite is continued .",

    "also , @xmath7 denotes time and @xmath8 is the space variable such that either @xmath9 and the boundary condition @xmath10 is imposed , or @xmath11 so that @xmath12 is periodic in @xmath13 . with the metric on the hyperboloid ( [ eq : constraint1 ] ) taken to be that induced by @xmath14 ,",
    "the manifold is a symmetric space @xmath15 .",
    "its fundamental group then equals the group of integers @xmath16 , so that for each fixed @xmath17 , @xmath12 is a continuous mapping from a circle into @xmath3 and therefore has a winding number @xmath18 which is constant in @xmath17",
    ". the field can be visualized as a closed string wrapped around the hyperboloid and evolving in time .",
    "the heisenberg model arises from the hamiltonian density @xmath19 ( where the subscript @xmath13 denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath13 ) , with poisson brackets @xmath20 and the hamiltonian energy for the system is given by @xmath21 which we expect to be non - positive - definite due to the indefinite metric on the field space .",
    "the equations of motion for the system are given by @xmath22    the sigma model is defined by the lagrangian density @xmath23 from which the equations of motion @xmath24 arise , and where here and in what follows @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "both models in ( 1 + 1)-dimensions are integrable , in the sense that a suitable lax pair exists for each model which can be obtained by analytic continuation from the analogous @xmath27 systems .",
    "parametrizing the hyperboloid in terms of ` polar angles ' @xmath28 so that @xmath29 equation ( [ eq : hmmotion ] ) is then equivalent to @xmath30 in @xcite some simple static and time dependent ` winding ' solutions were shown to exist for this model , and here we extend the search for such winding solutions to those of travelling - wave type . to facilitate this , we introduce the functions @xmath31 with characteristic variable @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the speed of the wave and interactions with an external magnetic field are introduced through the constant @xmath34 .",

    "substitution into the above then results in @xmath43 with the 4 real parameters @xmath44 . for a solution of winding type ,",
    "we require first that @xmath45 be in some sense periodic in @xmath13 ( depending on the boundary conditions ) and that the integral over @xmath46 of ( [ eq : dgxi ] ) be a finite integer multiple of @xmath47 i.e. that , in terms of @xmath48 @xmath49 with @xmath50 . taking as a first case , @xmath51 , i.e. in the absence of an external field",

    "( we note that this is a travelling - wave version of the static solution ( 13 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "that this is indeed a winding solution can be seen as follows : taking for simplicity @xmath58 ( since it is a fairly simple generalization to @xmath59 ) , scaling @xmath60 thereby eliminating @xmath41 , and with @xmath61 , in terms of our original constants @xmath62 , the solution ( [ soln : sinnhm ] ) can be rewritten @xmath63 with period @xmath47 .",

    "this _ is _ of winding type , as can be seen by analysing    the behaviour of the function    @xmath78 as @xmath13 goes from    @xmath79 .",
    "briefly , this is as follows :    @xmath80 is a continuous function of @xmath13    which is never zero ( for @xmath81 to be zero requires    @xmath82 ) and as    @xmath83    so that @xmath81 takes the form of a loop , beginning and    ending at @xmath84 .",
    "now taking a branch cut from the origin of    @xmath81 space along the negative real axis , it remains to    show that @xmath81 wraps once around the origin so that    @xmath85 .",
    "for this to be the case ,    @xmath81 must pass through the positive real axis once and    only once so that @xmath86 must have a    _ unique _ , real solution @xmath13 .",

    "then    @xmath90 , i.e. the solution ( [ soln : re2 ] ) is a    travelling wave winding solution for the hhm where the space    @xmath11 and we have taken @xmath51 .",
    "hence    ( [ soln : re1 ] ) is also such a solution .    in our next example , we take the constant @xmath91 , in an attempt to find a more general solution . with the substitutions @xmath92 , equation ( [ eq : p(p ) ] )",
    "is transformed to @xmath93 retaining the 3 real parameters @xmath94 . and",
    "for a solution to be a travelling wave of winding type , @xmath95 should have three real zeros , so that there exists a positive bounded region in which the solution can oscillate .",
    "this imposes the restriction that @xmath96 .",
    "we shall presently examine how the limits of this behaviour are manifested for the spaces @xmath97 ; however , to facilitate this we first note that if @xmath95 , ( [ eq : c1p(p ) ] ) , has three real and distinct zeros @xmath98 then the following solution can be found in terms of elliptic funtions : @xmath99 \\label{soln : dj}\\ ] ] where the parameter @xmath100 .",
    "note that this is also a travelling wave solution of the kdv equation @xcite , and given values of @xmath101 , the shape of the cnoidal wave can be obtained either from tables of jacobian elliptic functions or by direct computation .    to determine whether or not the solution is actually of winding type for our model if @xmath102 is given by ( [ soln : dj ] ) , it is no simple matter ( and may not be possible at all ) to integrate ( [ eq : dgxi ] ) .",
    "so rather than attempt this we will investigate what happens in the limiting cases , i.e. where the parameter @xmath103 .",
    "when @xmath104 one has @xmath105 and @xmath95 has one repeated and one single zero with no positive bounded region .",
    "the solution is then @xmath106 and in this case , @xmath107 ; so that if @xmath50 we recover the winding solution @xmath108 of @xcite .",
    "a further limiting case occurs when @xmath95 has one repeated and one single zero where the region between them is positive and bounded . if @xmath109 is the double zero and @xmath110 the single , then this picture corresponds to a travelling wave on @xmath9 where the solution has a minimum at @xmath111 ( since @xmath112 ) and reaches @xmath113 as @xmath114 . now referring back to solution ( [ soln : dj ] ) and considering the limit where the parameter @xmath115 , one can see that @xmath116 must equal @xmath109 which is exactly the situation described . and since @xmath117 , ( [ soln : dj ] ) reduces to @xmath118 .",
    "\\label{soln : hmm1}\\ ] ] it is possible to find explicit expressions for @xmath119 satisfying our equation ( [ eq : c1p(p ) ] ) and giving the correct picture , however , it turns out that this is not a winding solution for our heisenberg model ; on substitution of ( [ soln : hmm1 ] ) into ( [ eq : dgxi ] ) one finds , for example in the one - wind case , that @xmath120   \\label{hmm1dg } \\\\                 & + \\overline{\\omega } \\bigl [ \\frac{1}{\\overline{\\lambda }                    - \\cosh x } + \\frac{1}{\\overline{\\lambda } + \\cosh x }                    \\bigr ] \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath121 ^{\\frac{1}{2 } } $ ] .",
    "integrated over @xmath9 , ( [ hmm1dg ] ) diverges so that @xmath122 wraps infinitely many times around the hyperboloid @xmath3 .",
    "and this solution is therefore not of winding type since we require that the winding number @xmath18 be finite .",
    "we note further that this behaviour also manifests itself in the corresponding hamiltonian density .",
    "for example , take the simple case @xmath123 , so that @xmath124 and for the one - wind solution , @xmath125 . the hamiltonian density is then given by @xmath126^{2 } - 16(\\sqrt{2 +                   \\sqrt{5}})\\mbox{sech}^{4}(x)\\tanh ^{2}(x)}{(\\sqrt{2 +                   \\sqrt{5 } } ) ( 1 + 4\\mbox { sech}^{4}(x))},\\ ] ] the profile of which    is shown in figure ( [ fig : he ] ) .",
    "one can see that as @xmath127 does not tend to zero hence , the hamiltonian energy is infinite .",
    "since the profile of the density @xmath128 is , however , that of an attractive uniform lump , some renormalization procedure might be utilized to remove this infinity but we will not pursue this possibility here .",
    "in @xcite we stated that in fact , no travelling wave solutions of winding type exist with @xmath9 for this model and we now show this to be the case",
    ". for such solutions to exist requires    ( i ) : :    the solution @xmath102 be real and bounded so    @xmath129 ( from the form of @xmath95 ( [ eq : p(p ) ] )    one can see that @xmath102 will vary monotonically until    @xmath130 vanishes ) ; ( ii ) : :    @xmath95 have two real zeros ; one repeated and one simple    ( @xmath131 and @xmath109 respectively ) , where the    solution @xmath102 has a minimum at @xmath113    and @xmath132 .    recalling further that @xmath133 we must further demand that    ( iii ) : :    @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the zero of    @xmath136 , so that    @xmath137 ( * ( ii ) * above ) , and ( iv ) : :    @xmath138 const . as    @xmath139 and in fact on @xmath9 ,    * ( iii ) * and * ( i ) * above imply @xmath140 , so that    @xmath141 .",
    "we note first that with @xmath142 must have the form @xmath143 for some @xmath144 . to show that the conditions * ( i)*-*(iv ) * can not be satisfied for a solution @xmath48 of the hhm we need only now use condition * ( iv ) * , i.e. @xmath145 in equation ( [ eq : p(p ) ] ) .",
    "this substitution results in the equation @xmath146 presenting the following possibilities : @xmath147 the first three can be immediately discounted since we require real , non - zero @xmath33 and case ( d ) results in @xmath148 , thereby contradicting * ( ii ) * above . substituting ( e ) into ( [ eq : p(p ) ] ) and comparing the resultant equation with ( [ comparepzero ] ) allows only @xmath149 so that we are left with case ( f ) .",
    "following the same procedure as with ( e ) one finds that either @xmath149 or @xmath150 . in the latter instance",
    ", this imposes that @xmath151 , again contradicting * ( ii)*. all possibilities have then been exhausted for values of the parameters satisfying ( [ comparepzero ] ) so that no @xmath48 can exist satisfying all of the conditions * ( i)*-*(iv)*. hence , whilst they do exist for the space @xmath11 , we have shown that there are no travelling wave solutions of winding type for this model when @xmath46 is the real line @xmath152 .",

    "if one tries to find a solution with @xmath157 it turns out that @xmath158 is a function of @xmath17 only , in which case the equations admit the solution @xmath159 ,                   \\label{soln : tanhtheta}\\ ] ] with @xmath160 .",
    "this is almost identical to a solution of the equations in the positive definite version @xcite . observing that @xmath161",

    "each of these positive functions reaches infinity in a finite time ( this instability being explicit in the solutions ) , however , it is interesting to note that the total energy is a conserved ( negative ) quantity .",
    "the same calculation shows that in the positive definite case of @xcite , this quantity is greater than zero and indeed greater than the lower bound for the energy .    in our search for solutions of the system , as with the previous section ,",
    "we turn our attention to travelling waves for the hsm .",
    "the equations of motion in this case , with @xmath167 are then @xmath168 as a first case let us again take @xmath51 so that @xmath169 noting then that @xmath170 by ( [ hsmg2 ] ) , we have the following first integrals for @xmath171 : @xmath172 where @xmath173 are constants .",
    "an analogous solution to ( [ soln : sinnhm ] ) derives from these equations , namely @xmath174\\ ] ] where again @xmath175 is a constant .",
    "this is a winding solution for hsm as can be shown in much the same way as we did for the solution ( [ soln : sinnhm ] ) of hhm .    if @xmath176 , the following equations arise : @xmath177 where @xmath178 are constants . and for @xmath179 to be periodic @xmath95 must take the form @xmath180 for @xmath181 so that @xmath95 is positive and bounded between the two zeros @xmath182 .",
    "comparing coefficients results in the following two equations for @xmath183 : @xmath184 which , putting @xmath185 and without loss of generality @xmath91 , imposes the conditions @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",

    "if @xmath95 takes the form ( [ p(p)jk ] ) , for winding solutions we would , of course , expect @xmath199 as usual and if this were the case , in the limiting case just described where @xmath192 one would expect @xmath200 to amount to half that since one half period is traversed .",

    "so whilst this does not constitute a proof , it at least gives us an indication that the general solution ( [ ellhsm ] ) may not be of winding type .",
    "integrable systems admitting time dependent topological solutions are comparatively rare , the sine - gordon being virtually the only well known example . the models described here are such integrable models and we have shown that whilst no travelling wave solutions classifiable by an integer winding number exist for the hyperbolic heisenberg model where @xmath203 and that they are unlikely to exist for the sigma model with this @xmath46 , they do exist when @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , we have shown that there exist solutions with @xmath11 which , whilst not being identical in the different models , are of a common form to both .",
