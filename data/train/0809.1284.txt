    "the idea , proposed in @xcite , that our four - dimensional universe might be a three - brane , embedded in a five - dimensional space - time ( the bulk ) , has attracted a considerable interest in the past few years . according to the brane - world scenario , the physical fields ( electromagnetic , yang - mills etc . ) in our four - dimensional universe are confined to the three brane .",
    "these fields are assumed to arise as fluctuations of branes in string theories .",
    "only gravity can freely propagate in both the brane and bulk space - times , with the gravitational self - couplings not significantly modified .",
    "this model originated from the study of a single @xmath0-brane embedded in five dimensions , with the @xmath1 metric given by @xmath2 , which , due to the appearance of the warp factor , could produce a large hierarchy between the scale of particle physics and gravity .",
    "even if the fifth dimension is uncompactified , standard @xmath3 gravity is reproduced on the brane .",
    "hence this model allows the presence of large , or even infinite non - compact extra dimensions .",
    "our brane is identified to a domain wall in a @xmath4-dimensional anti - de sitter space - time . for a review of the brane world models",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the braneworld description of our universe entails a large extra dimension and a fundamental scale of gravity that might be lower by several orders of magnitude compared to the planck scale @xcite . due to the correction terms coming from the extra dimensions , significant deviations from the einstein theory",
    "occur in brane world models at very high energies @xcite .",
    "gravity is largely modified at the electro - weak scale of @xmath5 tev .",
    "the cosmological and astrophysical implications of the brane world theories have been extensively investigated in the physical literature  all2,sol .",
    "several classes of spherically symmetric solutions of the static gravitational field equations in the vacuum on the brane have been obtained in  @xcite . as a possible physical application of these solutions the behavior of the angular velocity @xmath6 of the test particles in stable circular orbits",
    "has been considered  @xcite .",
    "the general form of the solution , together with two constants of integration , uniquely determines the rotational velocity of the particle . in the limit of large radial distances , and for a particular set of values of the integration constants the angular velocity tends to a constant value .",
    "this behavior is typical for massive particles ( hydrogen clouds ) outside galaxies , and is usually explained by postulating the existence of the dark matter .",
    "the exact galactic metric , the dark radiation , the dark pressure and the lensing in the flat rotation curves region in the brane world scenario has been obtained in @xcite .    for standard general relativistic spherical compact objects the exterior space - time is described by the schwarzschild metric . in the five dimensional brane world models , the high energy corrections to the energy density , together with the weyl stresses from bulk gravitons , imply that on the brane the exterior metric of a static star is no longer the schwarzschild metric @xcite .",
    "the presence of the weyl stresses also means that the matching conditions do not have a unique solution on the brane ; the knowledge of the five - dimensional weyl tensor is needed as a minimum condition for uniqueness .",
    "it is known that the einstein field equations in five dimensions admit more general spherically symmetric black holes on the brane than four - dimensional general relativity .",
    "hence an interesting consequence of the braneworld scenario is in the nature of the spherically symmetric vacuum solutions to the brane gravitational field equations , which could represent black holes with properties quite distinct as compared to ordinary black holes in four dimensions .",
    "such black holes are likely to have very diverse cosmological and astrophysical signatures .",
    "static , spherically symmetric exterior vacuum solutions of the brane world models have been proposed first in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "the first of these solutions , obtained in @xcite , has the mathematical form of the reissner - nordstrm solution of the standard general relativity , in which a tidal weyl parameter plays the role of the electric charge of the general relativistic solution .",
    "the solution has been obtained by imposing the null energy condition on the 3-brane for a bulk having non zero weyl curvature , and it can be matched to the interior solution corresponding to a constant density brane world star . a second exterior solution , which also matches a constant density interior , has been derived in @xcite .",
    "two families of analytic solutions of the spherically symmetric vacuum brane world model equations ( with @xmath7 ) , parameterized by the adm mass and a ppn parameter @xmath8 have been obtained in @xcite .",
    "non - singular black - hole solutions in the brane world model have been considered in @xcite , by relaxing the condition of the zero scalar curvature but retaining the null energy condition .",
    "the four - dimensional gauss and codazzi equations for an arbitrary static spherically symmetric star in a randall  sundrum type ii brane world have been completely solved on the brane in @xcite .",
    "the on - brane boundary can be used to determine the full @xmath4-dimensional space - time geometry .",
    "the procedure can be generalized to solid objects such as planets .",
    "a method to extend into the bulk asymptotically flat static spherically symmetric brane - world metrics has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "the exact integration of the field equations along the fifth coordinate was done by using the multipole ( @xmath9 ) expansion .",
    "the results show that the shape of the horizon of the brane black hole solutions is very likely a flat `` pancake '' for astrophysical sources .",
    "the general solution to the trace of the 4-dimensional einstein equations for static , spherically symmetric configurations has been used as a basis for finding a general class of black hole metrics , containing one arbitrary function @xmath10 , which vanishes at some @xmath11 ( the horizon radius ) in @xcite . under certain reasonable restrictions ,",
    "black hole metrics are found , with or without matter .",
    "depending on the boundary conditions the metrics can be asymptotically flat , or have any other prescribed asymptotic .",
    "the exact stationary and axisymmetric solutions describing charged rotating black holes localized on a 3-brane in the randall - sundrum braneworld were studied in @xcite .  by taking the metric on the brane to be of the kerr - schild form",
    "it can be shown that the kerr - newman solution of ordinary general relativity in which the electric charge is superseded by a tidal charge satisfies a closed system of the effective gravitational field equations on the brane .",
    "the negative tidal charge may provide a mechanism for spinning up the black hole so that its rotation parameter exceeds its mass . for a review of the black hole properties and of the lensing in the brane world models see @xcite .",
    "it is generally expected that most of the astrophysical objects grow substantially in mass via accretion .",
    "recent observations suggest that around most of the active galactic nuclei ( agn s ) or black hole candidates there exist gas clouds surrounding the central compact object , and an associated accretion disc , on a variety of scales from a tenth of a parsec to a few hundred parsecs @xcite .",
    "these clouds are assumed to form a geometrically and optically thick torus ( or warped disc ) , which absorbs most of the ultraviolet radiation and the soft x - rays .",
    "the gas exists in either the molecular or the atomic phase .",
    "the most powerful evidence for the existence of super massive black holes comes from the very - long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) imaging of molecular @xmath12 masers in the active galaxy ngc 4258 miyo95 .",
    "this imaging , produced by doppler shift measurements assuming keplerian motion of the masering source , has allowed a quite accurate estimation of the central mass , which has been found to be a @xmath13 super massive dark object , within @xmath14 parsecs .",
    "hence , important astrophysical information can be obtained from the observation of the motion of the gas streams in the gravitational field of compact objects .    the determination of the accretion rate for an astrophysical object can give a strong evidence for the existence of a surface of the object . a model",
    "in which sgr a * , the @xmath15 super massive black hole candidate at the galactic center , may be a compact object with a thermally emitting surface was considered in @xcite . for very compact surfaces within the photon orbit ,",
    "the thermal assumption is likely to be a good approximation because of the large number of rays that are strongly gravitationally lensed back onto the surface . given the very low quiescent luminosity of sgr a * in the near - infrared , the existence of a hard surface , even in the limit in which the radius approaches the horizon , places a severe constraint on the steady mass accretion rate onto the source , @xmath16 yr@xmath17 .",
    "this limit is well below the minimum accretion rate needed to power the observed submillimeter luminosity of sgr a * , @xmath18 yr@xmath19 .",
    "thus , from the determination of the accretion rate it follows that sgr a * does not have a surface , that is , it must have an event horizon .",
    "therefore the study of the accretion processes by compact objects is a powerful indicator of their physical nature .",
    "the first comprehensive theory of accretion disks around black holes was constructed in @xcite .",
    "this theory was extended to the general relativistic models of the mass accretion onto rotating black holes in noth73 .",
    "these pioneering works developed thin steady - state accretion disks , where the accreting matter moves in keplerian orbits . the hydrodynamical equilibrium in the disk",
    "is maintained by an efficient cooling mechanism via radiation transport .",
    "the photon flux emitted by the disk surface was studied under the assumption that the disk emits a black body radiation .",
    "the properties of radiant energy flux over the thin accretion disks were further analyzed in @xcite and in @xcite , where the effects of the photon capture by the hole on the spin evolution were presented as well . in these works the efficiency",
    "with which black holes convert rest mass into outgoing radiation in the accretion process was also computed .",
    "the emissivity properties of the accretion disks have also been investigated for exotic central objects recently , such as quark , boson or fermion stars for both rotating and non - rotating cases @xcite , as well as for the modified @xmath20 type theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "the radiation power per unit area , the temperature of the disk and the spectrum of the emitted radiation were given , and compared with the case of a schwarzschild black hole of an equal mass .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to study the matter accretion by brane world black holes . by using the general formalism of accretion",
    "we analyze the accretion process for several black hole type solutions of the gravitational field equations on the brane , both non - rotating and rotating , which have been previously obtained .",
    "particular signatures can appear in the electromagnetic spectrum , thus leading to the possibility of directly testing extra - dimensional physical models by using astrophysical observations of the emission spectra from accretion disks .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "we review the field equations of the brane world models and the static , spherically symmetric solutions of the field equations as well as the rotating ones in section ii .",
    "the thin accretion disks onto black holes are briefly described in section iii . in section",
    "iv we consider the radiation flux , spectrum and efficiency of thin accretion disks onto several classes of brane world black holes . we discuss and conclude our results in section v.",
    "in the present section we briefly describe the basic mathematical formalism of the brane world models , and we present the spherically symmetric static vacuum field equations . the solutions of the vacuum field equations on the brane physically describe the brane world black holes .",
    "we start by considering a five dimensional ( 5d ) spacetime ( the bulk ) , with a single four - dimensional ( 4d ) brane , on which matter is confined .",
    "the 4d brane world @xmath21 is located at a hypersurface @xmath22 in the 5d bulk spacetime @xmath23 , of which coordinates are described by @xmath24 .",
    "the induced 4d coordinates on the brane are @xmath25 . in the present paper the capital latin indices @xmath26 , @xmath27 take values in the range @xmath28 , while the greek indices run in the range @xmath29 .",

    "a brane is a fixed point of the @xmath47 symmetry .",
    "the basic equations on the brane are obtained by projections onto the brane world .",
    "the induced 4d metric is @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the space - like unit vector field normal to the brane hypersurface @xmath50 .",
    "the unit vector field satisfies the condition @xmath51 . in the following we assume @xmath52 . in the brane world models only gravity can probe the extra dimensions .    assuming a metric of the form @xmath53 , with @xmath54 the unit normal to the @xmath55 hypersurfaces and @xmath56 the induced metric on @xmath55 hypersurfaces , the effective 4d gravitational equation on the brane takes the form  @xcite : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the local quadratic energy - momentum correction @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the non - local effect from the free bulk gravitational field , the transmitted projection of the bulk weyl tensor @xmath61 , @xmath62 , with the property @xmath63as@xmath64 .",
    "we have also denoted @xmath65 , with @xmath66 the usual 4d gravitational constant .",
    "the 4d cosmological constant , @xmath67 , and the 4d coupling constant , @xmath68 , are related by @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively . in the limit @xmath71",
    "we recover standard general relativity @xcite .",
    "the einstein equation in the bulk and the codazzi equation also imply the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor of the matter on the brane , @xmath72 , where @xmath73 denotes the brane covariant derivative .",
    "moreover , from the contracted bianchi identities on the brane it follows that the projected weyl tensor obeys the constraint @xmath74 .",

    "a background illuminated black hole will appear in a silhouette with radius @xmath311 , with an angular size of roughly twice that of the horizon , and may be directly observed . with an expected resolution of @xmath312 @xmath137as , submillimeter very - long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) would be able to image the silhouette cast upon the accretion flow of sgr a@xmath310 , with an angular size of @xmath313 @xmath137as , or m87 , with an angular size of @xmath314 @xmath137as . for a black hole embedded in an accretion flow , the silhouette will generally be asymmetric regardless of the spin of the black hole . even in an optically thin accretion flow asymmetry",

    "detailed measurements of the size and shape of the silhouette could yield information about the mass and spin of the central black hole , and provide invaluable information on the nature of the accretion flows in low luminosity galactic nuclei .    due to the differences in the space - time structure , the brane world black holes present some important differences with respect to their disc accretion properties , as compared to the standard general relativistic schwarzschild and kerr cases .",
    "therefore , the study of the accretion processes by compact objects is a powerful indicator of their physical nature . since the conversion efficiency",
    ", as well as the flux and the spectrum of the black body radiation in the case of the brane world black holes is different as compared to the standard general relativistic case , the astrophysical determination of these physical quantities could discriminate , at least in principle , between the different gravity theories , and give some constrains on the existence of the extra dimensions .",
