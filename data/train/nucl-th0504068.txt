    "with the exotic beam facilities all over the world - and more are to come - direct reaction theories are experiencing a renaissance .",
    "we report on recent work - just finished and in progress - on coulomb dissociation of halo nuclei @xcite and on transfer reactions to bound and scattering states .",
    "we hope to report on further progress at the next workshop at msu / anl / int / jina / ria or elsewhere .",
    "electromagnetic strength functions of halo nuclei exhibit universal features that can be described in terms of characteristic scale parameters . for a nucleus with nucleon+core structure the reduced transition probability ,",
    "as determined , e.g. , by coulomb dissociation experiments ( for a review see @xcite ) , shows a typical shape that depends on the nucleon separation energy and the orbital momenta in the initial and final states .",
    "the sensitivity to the final - state interaction ( fsi ) between the nucleon and the core can be studied systematically by varying the strength of the interaction in the continuum . in the case of neutron+core",
    "nuclei analytical results for the reduced transition probabilities are obtained by introducing an effective - range expansion .",
    "the scaling with the relevant parameters is found explicitly .",
    "general trends are observed by studying several examples of neutron+core and proton+core nuclei in a single - particle model assuming woods - saxon potentials .",
    "many important features of the neutron halo case can be obtained already from a square - well model . rather simple analytical formulae are found .",
    "the nucleon - core interaction in the continuum affects the determination of astrophysical s factors at zero energy in the method of asymptotic normalisation coefficients ( anc ) .",
    "it is also relevant for the extrapolation of radiative capture cross sections to low energies .",
    "coulomb dissociation of a neutron halo nucleus in the limit of a zero - range neutron - core interaction in the coulomb field of a target nucleus can be studied in various limits of the parameter space and rather simple analytical solutions can be found .",
    "we propose to solve the scattering problem for this model hamiltonian by means of the various advanced numerical methods that are available nowadays . in this way",
    "their range of applicability can be studied by comparison to the analytical benchmark solutions .",
    "the trojan - horse method @xcite is a particular case of transfer reactions to the continuum under quasi - free scattering conditions .",
    "special attention is paid to the transition from reactions to bound and unbound states and the role of subthreshold resonances .",
    "since the binding energies of nuclei close to the drip line tend to be small , this is expected to be an important general feature in exotic nuclei .",
    "at low energies the effect of the nuclear potential is conveniently described by the effective - range expansion @xcite .",
    "an effective - range approach for the electromagnetic strength distribution in neutron halo nuclei was introduced in @xcite and applied to the single neutron halo nucleus @xmath0be .",
    "recently , the same method was applied to the description of electromagnetic dipole strength in @xmath1o @xcite .",
    "a systematic study sheds light on the sensitivity of the electromagnetic strength distribution to the interaction in the continuum .",
    "we expose the dependence on the binding energy of the nucleon and on the angular momentum quantum numbers .",
    "our approach extends the familiar textbook case of the deuteron , that can be considered as the prime example of a halo nucleus , to arbitrary nucleon+core systems , for related work see @xcite .",
    "we also investigate in detail the square - well potential model .",
    "it has great merits : it can be solved analytically , it shows the main characteristic features and leads to rather simple and transparent formulae .",
    "as far as we know , some of these formulae have not been published before .",
    "these explicit results can be compared to our general theory for low energies ( effective - range approach ) and also to more realistic woods - saxon models . due to shape independence",
    ", the results of these various approaches will not differ for low energies .",
    "it will be interesting to delineate the range of validity of the simple models .",
    "our effective - range approach is closely related to effective field theories that are nowadays used for the description of the nucleon - nucleon system and halo nuclei @xcite .",
    "the characteristic low - energy parameters are linked to qcd in systematic expansions .",
    "similar methods are also used in the study of exotic atoms ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 ,  ) in terms of effective - range parameters .",
    "the close relation of effective field theory to the effective - range approach for hadronic atoms was discussed in ref .",

    "the result does not depend on @xmath58 itself but only on the `` coulomb push '' @xmath59 .    in the semiclassical high energy straight - line and electric dipole limit , first and second order analytical results are available , as well as for the sudden limit .",

    "this homework problem can be studied , e.g. , in the cdcc method , which was widely discussed at the workshop .",
    "it would be very interesting to see how well this method works in various limits of the parameter space .",
    "an especially interesting limit is the limit of low beam energies , where the cwba is very appropriate .",

    "the so - called post - decay acceleration of the fragments is studied and genuine three - particle wave functions for the final state are used . in their case",
    "there are three charged particles in the final state , but the problem is non - trivial even for only two ( out of three ) charged particles in the final state .    a related problem , the coulomb breakup of antideuterons bound in an orbit with quantum numbers @xmath25 , @xmath13 , @xmath73 @xcite",
    "can also be studied with this hamiltonian : in this case the charge of the core nucleus @xmath26 is negative , @xmath74 . in @xcite",
    "the adiabatic method is used : the antideuteron c.m .",
    "motion is assumed to be slow compared to the internal @xmath75 and @xmath76-motion and the authors calculate the antideuteron tunnel probability through the coulomb barrier which is provided by the nucleus z.",
    "exotic nuclei have low thresholds for particle emission .",
    "it is expected that in transfer reactions one will often meet a situation where the transferred particle is in a state close to the particle threshold . in `` normal '' nuclei ,",
    "the neutron threshold is around an excitation energy of about 8 mev , and the pure single particle picture is not directly applicable .",
    "much is known from stripping treactions like @xmath77 and thermal neutron scattering , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the single particle strength is fragmented over many more complicated compound states .",
    "the interesting quantity is the strength function which is proportional to @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the width and d the level spacing .",
    "this ratio is @xmath80 , as can be estimated from a square well model ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for @xmath81",
    "there are no sharp resonances , since @xmath82 around threshold . due to the angular momentum ( and/or )",
    "coulomb barrier , one has @xmath83 at threshold for all the other cases .    for neutron rich ( halo )",
    "nuclei the neutron threshold is much lower , of the order of one mev . in this case",
    "the single - particle properties are dominant and the ideas developed in the following can become relevant , see also @xcite .",
    "the level density is also much lower . in normal nuclei",
    "the level density at particle threshold is generally so high that the single particle structure is very much dissolved .",
    "this can be quite different in exotic nuclei which can show a very pronounced single particle structure .",
    "a similarity between cross sections for two - body and closely related three - body reactions under certain kinematical conditions @xcite led to the introduction of the trojan - horse method @xcite . in this indirect approach a two - body reaction @xmath84 that is relevant to nuclear astrophysics",
    "is replaced by a reaction @xmath85 with three particles in the final state .",
    "one assumes that the trojan horse @xmath40 is composed predominantly of clusters @xmath66 and @xmath62 , i.e.   @xmath86 .",
    "this reaction can be considered as a special case of a transfer reaction to the continuum .",
    "it is studied experimentally under quasi - free scattering conditions , i.e.  when the momentum transfer to the spectator @xmath62 is small .",
    "the method was primarily applied to the extraction of the low - energy cross section of reaction ( [ apreac ] ) that is relevant for astrophysics .",
    "however , the method can also be applied to the study of single - particle states in exotic nuclei around the particle threshold .      motivated by this we look again at the relation between transfer to bound and unbound states . our notation is as follows : we have the reaction @xmath87 where @xmath88 and b denotes the final @xmath89 system .",
    "it can be a bound state @xmath90 with binding energy @xmath91 , the open channel @xmath92 , or another channel @xmath93 of the system @xmath89 .",
    "in particular , the reaction @xmath94 can have a positive @xmath95 value and the energy @xmath96 can be negative as well as positive . as an example we quote the recently studied trojan horse reaction @xmath97+@xmath98li @xcite applied to the @xmath98li@xmath99he two - body reaction ( the neutron being the spectator ) . in this case",
    "there are two charged particles in the initial state ( @xmath98li+@xmath100 ) .",
    "another example with a neutral particle @xmath66 would be @xmath101be@xmath102be@xmath103 .",
    "the general question which we want to answer here is how the two regions @xmath104 and @xmath105 are related to each other .",
    "e.g. , in fig .",
    "7 of @xcite the coincidence yield is plotted as a function of the @xmath98li-@xmath100 relative energy .",
    "it is nonzero at zero relative energy . how does the theory @xcite ( and the experiment ) continue to negative relative energies ? with this method , subtreshold resonances can be investigated rather directly . we treat two cases separately , one where system @xmath90 is always in the @xmath106 channel , with a real potential @xmath107 between @xmath108 and @xmath66 . in the other case ,",
    "there are also other channels @xmath93 , at positive and negative energies @xmath96 .",
    "we imagine the following situation : the potential @xmath107 gives rise to a bound state with angular momentum @xmath13 close to threshold .",
    "now we decrease the potential so that the bound state disappears and reappears as a resonance in the continuum . for @xmath109",
    "there are sharp resonances and we can define a cross section for stripping to a resonance by integrating over the resonance line ( over an energy range which is several times larger than the width ) and they join smoothly to the stripping to the bound states , see @xcite .",
    "due to the absence of the angular momentum barrier for @xmath81 there are some peculiarites which we study now . stripping to bound states",
    "is determined by the asymptotic normalization constant @xmath90 ( see eqs .",
    "( a54 ) - ( a56 ) of @xcite ) of the bound - state wave function and the function @xmath110 where @xmath34 is related to the binding energy .",
    "since @xmath111 and @xmath112 the stripping cross section ( see , e.g. , eq .",
    "( 17 ) of @xcite ) to a ( halo ) state with @xmath81 tends to zero for @xmath34 going to zero , while it stays finite for @xmath109 .",
    "we note that the presence of a bound state close to zero energy leads to a large scattering length in the @xmath113 system which leads to an enhancement of the elastic breakup cross section .",
    "the double differential cross section at threshold is proportional to @xmath114 the quantity @xmath115 is given by @xmath116 for a bound and virtual state .",
    "thus the double differential cross section tends to zero like @xmath117 for @xmath81 .",
    "when the strength of the potential is decreased , the bound state becomes a virtual state , which again leads to a very large scattering length , see also @xcite . in this context",
    "it seems interesting to note that about 30 years ago a new type of threshold effects was predicted in @xcite ( what is now called a halo state was referred to as a puffy state in those days ) .",
    "related to this is the qualitative difference of @xmath81 and @xmath109 in the location of the poles of the s matrix in the complex plane @xcite . only for @xmath109",
    "there are poles of the s matrix close to the real axis .",
    "we follow the work of ichimura , austern , vincent , and kasano @xcite who have studied the case @xmath104 and we now extend it to the case of @xmath105 .",
    "the exclusive case can be also studied by generalizing , e.g. , eq .",
