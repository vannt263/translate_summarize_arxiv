    "dengue is a mosquito - borne infection that has become a major international public health concern . according to the world health organization ,",
    "50 to 100 million dengue infections occur yearly , including 500000 dengue haemorrhagic fever cases and 22000 deaths , mostly among children @xcite .",
    "dengue is found in tropical and sub - tropical regions around the world , predominantly in urban and semi - urban areas .",
    "there are two forms of dengue : dengue fever and dengue haemorrhagic fever .",
    "the first one is characterized by a sudden fever without respiratory symptoms , accompanied by intense headaches and lasts between three and seven days .",
    "the second one has the previous symptoms but also nausea , vomiting , fainting due to low blood pressure and can lead to death in two or three days @xcite .    the spread of dengue is attributed to expanding geographic distribution of the four dengue viruses and their mosquito vectors , the most important of which is the predominantly urban species _",
    "aedes aegypti_. the life cycle of a mosquito presents four distinct stages : egg , larva , pupa and adult . in the case of _",
    "aedes aegypti _ the first three stages take place in or near water while air is the medium for the adult stage @xcite .",
    "the adult stage of the mosquito is considered to last an average of eleven days in the urban environment .",
    "dengue is spread only by adult females , that require a blood meal for the development of eggs ; male mosquitoes feed on nectar and other sources of sugar . in this process",
    "the female acquire the virus while feeding on the blood of an infected person . after virus incubation for eight to ten days , an infected mosquito is capable , during probing and blood feeding , of transmitting the virus for the rest of its life .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . a mathematical model of the interaction between human and mosquito populations",
    "is presented in section  [ sec:2 ] .",
    "section  [ sec:3 ] is concerned with the equilibria of the epidemiological model and their stability . in section  [ sec:4 ] the results obtained in the previous section",
    "are applied to a study case .",
    "finally , some concluding notes are given in section  [ sec:5 ] .",
    "considering the work of @xcite , the relationship between humans and mosquitoes are now rather complex , taking into account the model presented in @xcite .",
    "the novelty in this paper is the presence of the control parameter related to adult mosquito spray .",
    "the notation used in our mathematical model includes four epidemiological states for humans :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the system ( [ odehuman])([odevector ] ) admits , at most , three equilibrium points :    * if @xmath0 , there is a disease - free equilibrium ( dfe ) , called trivial equilibrium , @xmath1 ; * if @xmath2 , there is a biologically realistic disease - free equilibrium ( brdfe ) , + @xmath3 + or an endemic equilibrium ( ee ) , @xmath4 .",
    "it is necessary to determine the _ basic reproduction number _ of the disease , @xmath5 .",
    "this number is very important from the epidemiologistic point of view .",
    "it represents the expected number of secondary cases produced in a completed susceptible population , by a typical infected individual during its entire period of infectiousness @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we prove :    if @xmath6 , then the basic reproduction number associated to ( [ odehuman])([odevector ] ) is @xmath7 .",
    "brdfe is locally asymptotically stable if @xmath8 and unstable if @xmath9 .    from a biological point of view",
    ", it is desirable that humans and mosquitoes coexist without the disease reaching a level of endemicity .",
    "we claim that proper use of the control @xmath10 can result in the basic reproduction number remaining below unity and , therefore , making brdfe stable .    in order to make effective use of achievable insecticide control , and simultaneously to explain more easily to the competent authorities its effectiveness , we assume that @xmath10 is constant .",
    "we want to find @xmath10 such that @xmath8 .",
    "the simulations were carried out using the following values : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "the initial conditions for the problem were : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "the final time was @xmath34 days .",
    "the values related to humans describes the reality of an infected period in cape verde @xcite .",
    "however , since it was the first outbreak that happened in the archipelago it was not possible to collect any data for the mosquito .",
    "thus , for the _ aedes aegypti _ we have selected information from brazil where dengue is already a reality long known @xcite .",
    "let us consider the parameters listed above and consider @xmath10 as a constant .",
    "then @xmath8 if and only if @xmath35 .    for our computations",
    "let us consider @xmath36 .",
    "the results indicate that use of the control @xmath10 is crucial to prevent that an outbreak could transform an epidemiological episode to an endemic disease .",
    "the computational experiences were carried out using scilab @xcite .",
    "figures [ human_control ] and [ human_nocontrol ] show the curves related to human population , with and without control , respectively .",
    "the number of infected persons , even with small control , is much less than without any spray campaign .",
    "human compartments with no control ]     human compartments with no control ]    the figures  [ mosquito_control ] and [ mosquito_nocontrol ] show the difference between a region with control and without control .",
    "mosquito compartments with no control ]     mosquito compartments with no control ]    the number of infected mosquitoes is close to zero in a situation where control is present . note that we do not intend to eradicate the mosquitoes but instead the number of infected mosquitoes .",
    "it is very difficult to control or eliminate the _ aedes aegypti _ mosquito because it makes adaptations to the environment and becomes resistant to natural phenomena ( droughts ) or human interventions ( control measures ) .    during outbreaks emergency vector control measures",
    "can also include broad application of insecticides .",
    "it has been shown here that with a steady spray campaign it is possible to reduce the number of infected humans and mosquitoes .",
    "active monitoring and surveillance of the natural mosquito population should accompany control efforts to determine programme effectiveness .",
