    "the concept of atoms in the molecule ( aim ) has always played a central role in classifying and predicting chemical properties . because this concept does not naturally show up in molecular orbital ( mo ) theory ,",
    "there is a sustained interest in extracting chemical atoms and functional groups from mo - based calculations . among the most popular techniques are mulliken population analysis @xcite , bader s quantum chemical topology ( qct ) @xcite , the hirshfeld method in its original @xcite and iterative version @xcite , the iterative stockholder approach @xcite , and mayer s fuzzy atoms @xcite .",
    "most methods are restricted to the partitioning of the electron density , but not all properties of a quantum mechanical object can be explicitly expressed in terms of the electron density . a more fundamental approach to the aim should be based on density matrices @xcite . because of the inherent non - locality of the density matrix , it was recently argued that a two - index partitioning into atomic ( diagonal ) and bond ( off - diagonal ) contributions , is necessary to guarantee the local nature and transferability of the atoms @xcite .",
    "the authors recently introduced such an approach @xcite , but the bond matrices had significant contributions from core electrons and free electron pairs , which somewhat blurred the interpretation in terms of chemical bonding . in this paper",

    "the interpretive problems are overcome by defining atomic weight matrices to be orthogonal projection operators onto one - electron subspaces assigned to atoms .",

    "if the atomic weight matrices are chosen as projectors onto orthogonal subspaces , which implies that they are both idempotent and orthogonal @xmath9 then the bond matrices @xmath8 have a zero trace and only the atomic matrices @xmath7 will contribute to the number of electrons n in the molecule @xmath10 note that in general the orthogonality of the weight matrices does not imply a zero overlap between the atomic electron densities @xmath11 in coordinate space , as occurs in e.g. qct .",

    "we therefore replace any eigenvalues of the @xmath12 and @xmath16 by a small ( @xmath21 ) positive value .",
    "this is sufficient to ensure that all @xmath18 remain nonsingular .",
    "as in ordinary hirshfeld , the choice of the starting point ( the isolated atom 1 dm s @xmath12 ) is crucial , since different results are obtained depending on the charge and electronic state of the isolated atom . following the ideas behind the iterative hirshfeld procedure @xcite , the result can be made independent of the starting point by building in self - consistency through an outer iterative scheme ( where eq .",
