    "the nature of the psuedogap regime of underdoped cuprate high - temperature superconductors is still under debate@xcite .",
    "studies have conjectured @xcite that superconducting ( sc ) fluctuations survive over a large range of temperatures above the transition temperature , @xmath1 .",
    "the large nernst signal@xcite measured above @xmath1 has been used to justify this viewpoint , since the nernst effect is generally small in non - magnetic metals , and is large in the vortex state of superconductors .",
    "while the nernst effect in the vortex state has been well understood for many years@xcite , ussishkin @xcite were the first to theoretically consider it in a model of fluctuating superconductivity above @xmath1 .",
    "they calculated the transverse thermoelectric transport coefficient within the gaussian limit of a time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) model . for two - dimensional systems , which constitute the focus of our interest",
    ", this model can describe superconducting fluctuations far above the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless transition temperature , @xmath2 .",
    "their results agree with nernst measurements in amorphous nb@xmath3si@xmath4 films@xcite and in overdoped , but not underdoped cuprates@xcite , where phase fluctuations@xcite , specifically thermally excited vortices@xcite , may be required to explain the nernst effect closer to @xmath2 .    over the last few years , x - ray scattering from the pseudogap state of underdoped cuprates@xcite has revealed charge density wave ( cdw ) order whose strength diminishes upon cooling below @xmath1 , thereby indicating a competition between this order and superconductivity .",
    "hence , it is desirous to reconsider the nernst effect within a theory which incorporates the observed competition . a cdw order can affect the nernst signal in a couple of ways .",
    "one route@xcite is via the cdw s effect on quasiparticles , which can in turn change the measured nernst signal .",
    "the second route , which we consider here , is its competition with sc fluctuations .",
    "above @xmath2 the cdw fluctuations are important in determining the properties of thermally excited sc vortices@xcite and consequently the size of the nernst signal . at even higher temperatures , where thermally excited vortices begin to overlap , ussishkin",
    "s results for the gaussian tdgl are expected to hold , provided one properly accounts for the effect of the competing cdw .",
    "recently , hayward @xcite formulated the competition between the sc and cdw order parameters using a phenomenological non - linear sigma model ( nlsm ) . by running monte - carlo simulations of their model",
    ", they were able to reproduce the temperature dependence of the cdw structure factor as observed in the x - ray experiments .",
    "in addition , they treated the model analytically in the case of a large number , @xmath0 , of order parameter components . using a saddle - point approximation and including @xmath5 corrections they were able to reproduce the numerical results for the cdw structure factor and to calculate the diamagnetic susceptibility at high temperatures .",
    "their result for the latter agrees with the expected behavior from gaussian sc fluctuations .",
    "the transverse thermoelectric transport coefficient , @xmath6 , is defined as the ratio between an applied temperature gradient , @xmath7 , and the resulting transverse electric current , @xmath8 , , @xmath9 . for systems with particle - hole symmetry or when sc fluctuations dominate , the experimentally measured nernst signal is given by@xcite @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the longitudinal resistivity .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to calculate @xmath6 at high temperatures using the @xmath12 limit of hayward s model . for simplicity",
    "we consider the fully @xmath13 symmetric case , but the results can be generalized to a more experimentally relevant model , where the symmetry is not exact . unlike the magnetization , which is calculated in equilibrium ,",
    "the nernst effect is a transport phenomenon which must be addressed within a dynamical model .",
    "here we assume that the sc and cdw fields obey a ( model a ) generalized langevin equation@xcite .",
    "using a path integral approach@xcite to the martin - siggia - rose formalism@xcite , we calculate diagrammatically the system s response to weak perturbations . as expected , we find that @xmath6 agrees with ussishkin s results for the gaussian tdgl model .",
    "we chose to include here the complete and detailed calculation , as we believe it has pedagogical value of its own .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows .",
    "the model , its langevin dynamics and the path integral approach that we use are presented in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "section [ sec : sp ] describes the saddle - point approximation which is employed throughout the paper . in section [ sec : dia ] we summarize various diagrams which are then used to calculate the diamagnetic susceptibility , in section [ sec : mz ] , and @xmath6 in section [ sec : alpha ] .",
    "we conclude with a discussion in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "some details of the calculation are relegated to the appendices .",
    "we start by considering an @xmath13 symmetric ginzburg - landau model of @xmath0 real order parameters , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , competing with each other : @xmath16 the non - linear sigma model ( nlsm ) , with the constraint , @xmath17 is obtained@xcite from ( [ eq : glapp ] ) by taking the limit @xmath18 . in order to study transport phenomena we need to introduce dynamics into the model",
    ". a simple approach , which we follow here , is to assume that the order parameters @xmath14 obey stochastic dynamics , without any conservation constraints ( model a of ref . ) .",
    "thus , the time dependence of the fields @xmath14 is given by a generalized langevin equation , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a relaxation constant , and @xmath21 is a gaussian white noise term with @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath24 denotes an average over all realizations of the noise term @xmath21 .",
