    "the application of mathematical and physics models to finance goes back to bachelier in 1900 , where it tests the hypothesis that stock prices follow a random walk .",
    "however this simple version of the model did not account for important characteristics of price variations , such as the occurrence of crashes , nonlinear serial dependence , etc .",
    "bachelier assumed that the price variations follow a normal distribution , constant over time , and do not pay attention to extreme events .",
    "however , the empirical evidence has shown that stock prices seldomly behave in such a way as described by bachelier .",
    "the stock markets are usually complex systems , because they are open systems where innumerous subsystems act and interact in a nonlinear and dynamic way , constituting an attraction for the physicists that studied the working of financial markets using different methods than those used by traditional economists .",
    "bonanno , lillo and mantegna ( 2001 ) consider that the financial markets show several levels of complexity that may occurred for being systems composed by agents that interact nonlinearly between them .",
    "these authors , among others , consider that the traditional models of asset pricing ( capm and apt ) failed because the basic assumptions of these models are not verified empirically .",
    "the entropy is a measure of dispersion , uncertainty , disorder and diversification used in dynamic processes , in statistics and information theory , and has been increasingly adopted in financial theory [ horowitz _ et al . _",
    "( 1968 ) , philippatos _ _  et al . _ _ ( 1972 ) , buchen _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) , zellner ( 1996 ) , molgedey _ _  et al . _",
    "_ ( 2000 ) , stuzer ( 2000 ) , london _ et al . _",
    "( 2001 ) ] .",
    "in addition to the studies mentioned above , bouchaud , potters and aguilar ( 1997 ) have used entropy as an integrating measure in the process of portfolio selection based on the mean - variance model of markowitz .",
    "this is because information is imperfect and the theoretical assumptions of portfolio selection models do not apply in the reality .",
    "the authors suggest the use of entropy with the purpose of obtaining a minimum diversification and , at the same time , an acceptable risk level to the investor . in a slightly different context ,",
    "fernholz ( 1999 ) and samperi ( 1999 ) analysed the entropy as a measure of diversification in financial markets .",
    "gulko ( 1998 ) analyses market equilibrium by building a model where entropy is maximized subject to certain restrictions .",
    "he defends the entropy pricing theory  as the main characteristic of market efficiency .",
    "the use of entropy as a measure of uncertainty in finance appears to have many potentialities and a vast field of development , both in theoretical and empirical work . in line with the above arguments",
    ", this paper examines the ability of entropy as a measure of uncertainty in portfolio management applied to the portuguese stock market , highlighting the fact that entropy verifies the effect of diversification .    in this article , the notion of uncertainty is related with the greater or lesser difficulty to predict the future .",
    "generally , it is normal to relate the variance or the standard - deviation and the var ( value - at - risk ) as the main risk and uncertainty measures in finance .",
    "however , some authors [ e.g. soofi ( 1997 ) , maasoumi ( 1993 ) , mccauley ( 2003 ) ] alert for the fact that these measures can fail in specific situations as a measure of uncertainty , since they need that the probability distributions are symmetric and neglect the possibility of extreme events such as the existence of fat - tails .",
    "suppose that we have a set of possible events whose probabilities of occurrence are @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 is a measure of uncertainty .",
    "according to shannon ( 1948 ) , a good measure of uncertainty @xmath3 should satisfy the following properties :    1 .",
    "@xmath2 should be continuous in @xmath4 2 .",
    "if @xmath5 , then @xmath2 should be a monotonic increasing function of @xmath6 ; 3 .",
    "@xmath2 is maximized in a uniform probability distribution context ; 4 .",
    "@xmath2 should be additive ; 5 .",
    "@xmath2 should be the weighted sum of the individual values of @xmath2    according to shannon ( 1948 ) one measure that satisfies all these properties is the entropy which is defined as @xmath7 . when the random variable has a continuous distribution , and @xmath8 is the density function of the random variable @xmath9 , the entropy is given by@xmath10    the properties of the entropy of continuous and discrete distributions are mainly alike .",
    "in particular we have [ shannon ( 1948 ) ; kraskov _ _  et al . _ _ ( 2004 ) ] :    @xmath11 : :    if @xmath9 is limited to a certain volume @xmath12 in    its space , then @xmath13 is a maximum and is equal to @xmath14 when    @xmath8 is constant , @xmath15 , in the volume ; @xmath16 : :    for any two variables @xmath9 and @xmath17 , we have    @xmath18 where the equality holds if    ( and only if ) @xmath9 and @xmath17 are statistically    independent , i.e. @xmath19 @xmath20 : :    the joint entropy can be given by    @xmath21since    @xmath22 then    @xmath23 and    @xmath24    the assumption that the data and the residuals follow a normal distribution is very common in portfolio management and regression analysis .",
    "thus , the equation used to estimate parametrically the entropy of a normal distribution , @xmath25 , is@xmath26    arafat , skubic and keegan ( 2003 ) consider that a measure of uncertainty should attend to the following properties : @xmath27 _ symmetry _ , that is @xmath28 and @xmath29 _ valuation _ : @xmath30 these authors discuss combined methods of uncertainty and conclude that entropy can be a good measure of uncertainty .",
    "one of the difficulties to estimate the mutual information on the basis of empirical data lies on the fact that the underlying _ pdf _ is unknown . to overcome this problem ,",
    "there are essentially three different methods to estimate mutual information :  histogram - based estimators ,  kernel - based estimators and  parametric methods .. the second approach presents some advantages , since it allows for a better adequacy to the data and maximizes mutual information [ darbellay ( 1998 ) ] . ] in order to minimize the bias that may occur , we will use the marginal equiquantization estimation process , proposed by darbellay ( 1998 ) .    the introduction of entropy as a measure of uncertainty in finance goes back to philippatos and wilson ( 1972 ) , which present a comparative analysis between the behaviour of the standard - deviation and the entropy on portfolio management .",
    "these authors conclude that entropy is more general and has some advantages facing to the standard - deviation . according to lawrence ( 1999 ) the two main measures of uncertainty are entropy and variance , because entropy is a concave function allows its use as an uncertainty function .",
    "historically , the variance has had a fundamental role in the analysis of risk and uncertainty . however , according to maasoumi ( 1993 ) , entropy can be an alternative measure of dispersion and in addition soofi ( 1997 ) considers that the interpretation of the variance as a measure of uncertainty must be done with some precaution .",
    "the entropy is a measure of disparity of the density @xmath31 from the uniform distribution .",
    "it measures uncertainty in the sense of `` utility '' of using @xmath31 in place of the uniform distribution .",
    "the variance measures an average of distances of outcomes of the probability distribution from the mean . according to ebrahimi , maasoumi and soofi ( 1999 ) ,",
    "both measures reflect concentration but their respective metrics of concentration are different . unlike the variance that measures concentration only around the mean , the entropy measures diffuseness of the density irrespective of the location of concentration .    in terms of mathematical properties ,",
    "entropy @xmath32 $ ] is non - negative in the discrete case . in the discrete case , @xmath33 is invariant under one - to - one transformations of @xmath9 , but the variance is not . for the continuous case , neither the entropy nor the variance are invariant under one - to - one transformations .",
    "the entropy of a continuous random variable @xmath9 takes values in @xmath34 -\\infty , + \\infty % \\right [ $ ] [ shannon ( 1948 ) ] .",
    "ebrahimi , maasoumi and soofi ( 1999 ) examined the role of  variance and entropy in ordering distributions and random prospects , and conclude that there is no universal relationship between these measures in terms of ordering distributions .",
    "these authors found that , under certain conditions , the order of the variance and entropy is similar when continuous variables are transformed and show ( using a legendre series expansion ) that the entropy depends on many more parameters of a distribution than the variance .",
    "a legendre series expansion reveals that entropy may be related to higher - order moments of a distribution which , unlike the variance , could offer a much better characterization of @xmath31 since it uses more information about the probability distribution than the variance .    in this paper",
    "we examine the sensitivity of entropy to the effect of diversification .",
    "the risk of a portfolio can be splitted into specific risk and systematic risk , that is not diversifiable ( see figure [ risk ] ) .",
    "using entropy we can obtain a similar type of information , since @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the mutual information between @xmath9 and @xmath17 and may be comparable with the systematic risk and @xmath37 is the conditional entropy that can be comparable with the specific risk .",
    "we must emphasize that the measures of information theory are not directly comparable to the analysis of variance in metric terms .    it is important to note some properties of the variance ( and standard - deviation ) and entropy as measures of uncertainty .",
    "the standard - deviation is a convex function , which according to the jensen inequality @xmath38 \\geq \\sigma \\left [ \\left ( ex\\right ) \\right ] .$ ] this property allows the variance and the standard - deviation to be used as risk measures in stock portfolios , since they take into account the effect of diversification .",
    "the entropy is a concave function and has a maximum for most of the probability distributions , and this fact leads us to think that entropy will not satisfy the effect of diversification .",
    "however , we must note that entropy is not a function of the values of the variables but the probability itself and the property @xmath39 can bring some hope in this way .    in this paper",
    "we perform a similar analysis to that presented by elton and gruber ( 1995 ) .",
    "these authors showed that diversification is a factor of minimization of the specific risk ( measured by the standard - deviation ) .",
    "they made a random selection of the assets to compose portfolios and the only premise is the fact that the proportion invested in each asset is @xmath40 , being @xmath41 the number of assets in the portfolio .",
    "we use daily closing prices of 23 stocks rated on the portuguese stock market ( _ euronext lisbon _ ) , spanning from 28/06/1995 to 30/12/2002 , which corresponds to 1856 observations _",
    "per _ stock , in order to compute the rates of return .",
    "the statistical analysis of these time series revealed that we must reject the null that the empirical distributions are normal , since they show high levels of kurtosis and skewness .    in order to compare the behaviour of entropy with the standard - deviation in a coherent way",
    ", we use the normal entropy ( equation [ normal ] ) , since the normal entropy is a function of the standard - deviation .    our results ( see figure [ comparative ] ) show that the entropy and the standard - deviation tend to decrease when we include one more asset in the portfolio . this fact allows us to conclude that entropy is sensitive to the effect of diversification .",
    "these results can be explained by the fact that when the number of assets in the portfolio increases , the number of possible states of the system ( portfolio ) declines progressively and the uncertainty about that portfolio tends to fall . besides",
    ", we verify that the entropy respects the condition of subadditivity suggested by reesor and mcleish ( 2002 ) , where @xmath42+h[(1-\\theta ) y]\\geq h[\\theta x+(1-\\theta ) y]$ ] , being @xmath43    we must highlight the fact that , in this example , the normal entropy assumes always higher values than the empirical entropy .",
    "this means that the predictability level of each portfolio is higher than the one assumed by the normal distribution .    from this preliminary analysis",
    ", we can conclude that entropy observes the effect of diversification and is a more general uncertainty measure than the variance , since it uses much more information about the probability distribution .",
    "this paper analyses the use of entropy as a measure of uncertainty in portfolio management .",
    "this can be a complementary way to the traditional mean - variance models , whose assumptions are typically quite restrictive .",
