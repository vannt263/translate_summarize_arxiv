    "relativistic motion in compact radio sources is indicated by apparent superluminal motion , one - sidedness of jets , rapid flux variations , and a deficit of synchrotron self - compton x - rays .",
    "the relativistic motion is characterized by 2 quantities : the angle @xmath0 subtended by the direction of outflow and the line of sight to the observer , and the bulk lorentz factor of the outflow @xmath1 , where @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is the speed of the outflow relative to the speed of light .",
    "the doppler factor @xmath4 of the outflow is a combination of these 2 parameters : @xmath5 .",
    "the apparent speed @xmath6 of a particular feature depends upon a different combination of these 2 parameters : @xmath7 .",
    "if a source has an estimate of both @xmath4 and @xmath6 , then there are 2 observations to constrain the 2 unknowns , so the bulk lorentz factor @xmath1 and the outflow angle @xmath0 may be estimated separately for the source . combining the equations for @xmath6 and @xmath4 , we obtain :    @xmath8    and @xmath9    equipartition doppler factors for 105 sources are discussed in  2 , bulk lorentz factors and outflow angles for 43 sources are discussed in  3 .",
    "the results are summarized in  4 .",
    "bulk relativistic motion can strongly alter the appearance of the emitter . in order to be able to study intrinsic source properties , and selection effects that determine",
    "which subset of the parent population make it into a radio catalogue , it is necessary to understand and correct for relativistic effects .",
    "the doppler factor may be estimated from single epoch radio observations using the  equipartition doppler factor , \" first introduced by readhead ( 1994 ) , and computed for a sample of 105 radio sources by guijosa and daly ( 1996 ) using the sample compiled and studied by ghisellini et al .",
    "guijosa and daly ( 1996 ) compare the equipartition doppler factor with the inverse compton doppler factor , and find that the two are strongly correlated .",
    "the appropriate error bar for each of these quantities is presently under investigation ( guerra and daly 1995 ) , and we plan to investigate in detail whether the fact that the ratio of equipartition to inverse compton doppler factor is about @xmath10 indicates that both are reliable estimators of the true doppler factor .",
    "it is quite interesting to note that the range and typical value of the doppler factor are different for each of the categories of agn studied .",
    "the 8 radio galaxies in the sample all have equipartition doppler factors @xmath11 less than or on the order of 1 , as do most of the 11 lobe - dominated quasars ( except for one quasar with @xmath12 ) .",
    "the 24 core - dominated high - polarization and 29 core - dominated low - polarization quasars are quite similar and have @xmath11 that range from about 1 to 30 ; the only apparent difference between the populations is that the core - dominated low - polarization quasars seem to have a cluster of points with @xmath13 that is not present in the high - polarization population . and , the 33 bl lacertae objects have @xmath11 that span the full range , with @xmath11 much less than one up to about relatively large values of about 30 ( see figure 1 and the figures of guijosa and daly 1996 ) .",
    "the range of @xmath11 for each category of source is evident on figure 1 , which shows the redshift behavior of @xmath11 for the sample of 105 sources discussed by guijosa and daly ( 1996 ) .",
    "the doppler factor appears to increase with redshift , as expected from selection effects ; more distant sources must be more strongly doppler boosted to make it into the sample .",
    "note , however , that a large part of the effect is due to low - redshift bl lacs , and the redshift behavior of @xmath11 may be different for different categories of agn ; this is presently under investigation .",
    "it would be fascinating and enlightening to be able to study the bulk lorentz factor and outflow angle for different categories of agn . this would shed light on the relationships between different categories of agn , and allow an estimate of selection effects for different types of agn as a function of redshift . as mentioned in  1 , it is possible to estimate @xmath1 and @xmath0 separately for sources with an estimate of both @xmath6 and @xmath11 .",
    "two important assumptions are : ( 1 ) that the apparent velocity is due to a physical motion of the emitter rather than a pattern speed of the flow , and ( 2 ) that the equipartition doppler factor provides a good rough estimate of the true doppler factor . both of these assumptions are presently under investigation by guerra and daly ( 1995 ) , who discuss the uncertainty on estimates of @xmath11 , @xmath1 , and @xmath0 . although error bars are not included here , some obvious trends are indicated by the data that are likely to stand the test of time .",
    "figure 2 shows the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 obtained by applying equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) to the 43 sources studied by both vermeulen and cohen ( 1994 ) , who investigate @xmath6 for a large number of sources , and by guijosa and daly ( 1996 ) , who investigate @xmath11 for a large number of sources .",
    "radio galaxies have lorentz factors that are typically close to unity , and tend to have very large angles to the line of sight .",
    "specifically , 6 of the 7 radio galaxies have values of @xmath1 between about 1 and 2 , and the seventh has @xmath14 ; all of the sources have @xmath0 between @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and about half of the radio galaxies in the sample have @xmath0 greater than @xmath17 .",
    "if these values are accurate , they indicate that these radio galaxies have a relatively slow , one - sided jet that is pointing _ away _ from the observer about half the time .",
    "six of the 7 lobe - dominated quasars in the sample have @xmath0 between @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and one has @xmath20 ; the lorentz factors range from 2 to 30 , with an apparent peak at @xmath14 .",
    "nine of the 10 low - polarization core - dominated quasars have @xmath0 between @xmath21 and @xmath18 , and one has @xmath22 ; the @xmath1 factors range from 2 to 20 with an apparent peak at @xmath14 .",
    "the range of lorentz factors for the high - polarization core - dominated quasars seems to be larger than that for the low - polarization quasars , with @xmath1 ranging from about 1 to 200 ( it is not clear if this apparent difference is significant ) , and 4 of the 8 high - polarization core - dominated quasars have @xmath23 .",
    "all of the 8 high - polarization core - dominated quasars in the sample have @xmath0 between @xmath21 and @xmath18 .",
    "the 3 core - dominated quasars without polarization information have values of @xmath0 between about @xmath24 and @xmath19 , and @xmath1 between about 1 and 10 .",
    "the 8 bl lacertae ojects seem to have a relatively broad range of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and sources with large @xmath0 tend to have small @xmath1 .",
    "two bl lacs have @xmath0 between @xmath25 and @xmath19 and @xmath1 between 1 and 2 , and 6 bl lacs have @xmath0 between about zero and @xmath18 and @xmath1 between about 2 and 30",
    ".    figures 3 and 4 show @xmath0 and @xmath1 as a function of @xmath26 . both appear to exhibit the type of selection effect seen in figure 1 and expected if the intrinsic luminosity of the sources is nonevolving , since in this case higher redshift sources must be more strongly doppler boosted to make it into the sample .",
    "thus , figures 3 and 4 suggest that @xmath0 decreases and @xmath1 increases with redshift . this is not a result of the adopted cosmology ;",
    "similar results are obtained when different cosmological parameters are assumed . however , it is not clear if the effect is significant , or if it is operating for each category of agn separately ; this point is presently under investigation . generally speaking ,",
    "the results presented here are consistent with those presented by vermeulen and cohen ( 1994 ) .",
    "it is striking that the different categories of agn have different typical values and ranges of @xmath11 , @xmath1 , and @xmath0 . generally , different categories of agn have values of these parameters that are consistent with expectations based on the orientation unified model .",
    "it is quite interesting to note that radio galaxies , lobe - dominated quasars , and some bl lacs have very similar values of the equipartition doppler factor @xmath11 , but clearly separate out on the @xmath0-@xmath1 diagram .",
    "the radio galaxies studied here appear to lie in a region of the diagram that is separate from the other types of agn .",
    "further , the radio galaxies have relatively slow outflow velocities , and about half of the sources are pointing _ away _ from the observer , suggesting one - sided slow jets ; note that radio galaxies are the only category of source with @xmath27 .",
    "lobe - dominated quasars , most bl lacs , and core - dominated high- and low - polarization quasars fill in the rest of the @xmath0-@xmath1 diagram .",
    "lobe - dominated quasars have relatively large @xmath0 and small @xmath1 compared with other types of quasars , but lie in a region of the diagram distinct from radio galaxies .",
    "core - dominated quasars tend to have the largest values of @xmath1 and smallest values of @xmath0 .",
    "bl lacertae objects appear to span the full range of parameters between lobe - dominated quasars and core - dominated quasars on the @xmath0-@xmath1 diagram ( of course , it is always possible that the category into which an individual object has been placed may be incorrect ) .",
    "similar conclusions are indicated by @xmath11 .",
    "it is clear from figure 1 that radio galaxies and lobe - dominated quasars tend to have low values of the equipartition doppler factor , typically @xmath13 .",
    "core - dominated high- and low - polarization quasars tend to have high values of the doppler factor , with @xmath11 between about 1 and 30 , with a few sources having a value less than 1 . and , the bl lacertae objects seem to span the full range of @xmath11 from values much less than one to values over 10 .",
    "again , we see that bl lacs span the full range , with values similar to lobe - dominated quasars and core - dominated quasars , though now with a much larger sample .    the large range of @xmath0 and @xmath11 seen for bl lacs may suggest either that we are looking so close to the central engine that the full collimation is not complete ,",
    "so we see a  spray \" and thus a broad range of @xmath0 and @xmath11 , or that the opening angle that allows an observer to see into the heart of the agn and classify it as a bl lac is larger than previously thought , or perhaps some sources have been mistakenly classified as bl lacs .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the @xmath0-@xmath1 diagram has been constructed assuming that @xmath11 is a good measure of the true doppler factor , and that @xmath6 reflects a bulk flow rather than a pattern speed .",
    "both of these assumptions are presently under investigation ( guerra & daly 1995 ) .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the participants of this meeting and other colleaques for interesting discussions , especially marshall cohen , ed groth , alan marscher , tim pearson , tony readhead , larry rudnick , peter scheuer , rene vermeulen , and paul wiita .",
