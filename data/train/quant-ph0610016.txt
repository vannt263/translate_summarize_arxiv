    "the knowledge of the density matrix at finite temperature @xmath0 for few interacting particles , is of paramount importance for studying equilibrium properties of quantum many - body systems . indeed",
    ", such density matrices occur in low - fugacity expansions , while they are also key ingredients in quantum monte carlo simulations . in this context , the feynman - kac ( fk ) representation of the density matrix in terms of path integrals  @xcite is particularly useful . on the one hand",
    ", it has been used for deriving exact ( analytical ) expressions for simple models  @xcite . on the other hand , beyond the well - known wigner - kirkwood expansion  @xcite around the classical limit , various approximations , non - perturbative in @xmath1 ,",
    "have been introduced within that framework : for instance , the celebrated semi - classical approximation  @xcite ( widely used in numerous situations ) , the variational approach of feynman and kleinert  @xcite , or the renormalized wigner - kirkwood scheme .",
    "the fk representation is described in sec .",
    "[ quantumformalism ] . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we consider the simple case of a single particle in one dimension submitted to a stationary confining potential .",
    "the mean spatial extension of the brownian paths , which intervene in the fk representation , is controlled by the thermal de broglie wavelength of the quantum particle . at high temperatures , since that extension vanishes , exact asymptotic expansions , as well as direct numerical estimations , become rather straightforward . at the analytical level",
    ", wigner - kirkwood @xmath2-expansions around the classical limit , which have been derived long ago in other frameworks , are easily recovered . on the computational side , functional integration over paths",
    "can be replaced , within a good accuracy , by ordinary integrals over a discrete set of parameters , _ via _ the use of either free propagators in trotter formula  @xcite or simple modelizations of brownian paths  @xcite . however , at low temperatures , similar calculations loose accuracy , while they also become rather time - consuming .",
    "moreover , the corresponding asymptotic structure of the density matrix , provided by the groundstate contribution in its spectral expression , does not clearly emerge from its fk representation .",
    "in fact , in that temperature regime , the average extension of paths diverge , whereas the main contribution to the functional integral arises from paths with a finite extension , of the order of the localization length of the ground state : contributions of such minority paths are significantly different from the average contribution .",
    "most of our knowledge is negative , i.e. tells us which trajectories are not important  @xcite , so , in some sense , we will try to have a positive attitude  @xcite .    in this paper , we derive a new functional representation of the density matrix , which is more suitable than the genuine fk formula for tackling the low - temperature regime ( see sec .  [ rewritingfeynamankac ] ) .",
    "the starting central observations are described in sec .",
    "first , in the fk functional integral , only marginal paths with finite extensions ( i.e. large deviations with respect to the average ) contribute when @xmath0 goes to zero .",
    "second , many of such paths with quite different jagged shapes , provide similar contributions , mainly determined by the corresponding local occupation times .",
    "thus , it is quite natural to collect paths into sets defined by their spatial extension and their local occupation times .",
    "that procedure allows us to transform exactly fk representation  ( [ fk ] ) into the so - called box formula  ( [ 2b3 ] ) .",
    "that formula is defined _ via _ the introduction of paths constrained to stay in a box with size @xmath3 and characterized by an intermediate flight time @xmath4 ( in @xmath5 units with @xmath6 ) .",
    "it involves a double ordinary integral over @xmath3 and @xmath4 , combined to functional integrals over local occupation times associated with the constrained paths .",
    "as required , box formula  ( [ 2b3 ] ) provides a better understanding of the low - temperature behaviour of the density matrix than fk representation  ( [ fk ] ) .",
    "when @xmath0 vanishes , leading contributions obviously arise from typical sizes @xmath3 much smaller than de broglie wavelength . in a forthcoming paper",
    ", we will argue how groundstate quantities emerge from box formula  ( [ 2b3 ] ) , by using scaling properties of the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of occupation times at low temperatures .    beyond its conceptual interest for understanding low - temperature behaviours of path integrals , box formula  ( [ 2b3 ] )",
    "also allows us to derive new approximations .",
    "this is illustrated in section  [ constrainedaverages ] , where we present the so - called ergodic approximation .",
    "that approximation results from the truncation to first order of cumulant expansions of the functional averages .",
    "it amounts to replace each local occupation time associated with a given constrained path , by its average over the pdf of such occupation times .",
    "this can be viewed as some kind of ergodic hypothesis , because the ( imaginary ) time average of the potential experienced by the particle along that path , is then replaced by a spatial average with a measure defined by the previous mean occupation - time .",
    "ergodic expression  ( [ est1_1b ] ) involves only an ordinary double integral over @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the key ingredient , namely the mean occupation - time ( in units of @xmath7 ) , depends on three dimensionless parameters . using its low and high temperature behaviours ( derived analytically ) , we propose simple tractable expressions for that quantity , which turn out to be quite accurate at any temperature .",
    "section  [ applications ] is devoted to the applications of the ergodic approximation to various simple forms of the confining potential .",
    "first , we determine the asymptotic analytical forms of the approximate density matrices at both low and high temperatures .",
    "when @xmath0 diverges , wigner - kirkwood expansion is partially recovered . when @xmath0 vanishes , the main features of the exact behaviours are well reproduced .",
    "the approximate density matrices then do factorize as a product of a boltzmann factor associated with a given energy , times a function of position only : this provides satisfatory approximate expressions for the groundstate energy and wavefunction .",
    "second , numerical calculations are performed at finite intermediate temperatures . as expected from the previous analytical results , the ergodic approximation turns out to be quite reasonably accurate over the whole range of considered temperatures , and discrepancies with ( numerically ) exact results ( in part inferred from the spectral representation )",
    "do not exceed a few percent .",
    "moreover , it significantly improves over the well - known semi - classical approximation , which completely fails at low temperatures ( except of course for the harmonic potential where semi - classical calculations become exact ) .",
    "further applications and extensions of our approach will be presented elsewhere . in particular , the ergodic approximation can be applied to unconfining potentials , and it can be straightforwardly extended to higher dimensions and to systems with several particles . furthermore , other approximations might be easily introduced by starting from box formula as argued at the end of section iii .",
    "in this section , we first define the model and then introduce the fk representation of the corresponding density matrix .",
    "next , we briefly recall the efficiency of fk formula for describing the high - temperature regime , and we argue about its drawbacks for analyzing low - temperature behaviours .",
    "we consider a quantum non - relativistic particle of mass @xmath8 in one dimension @xmath9 , submitted to a confining potential @xmath10 , i.e @xmath11 when @xmath12 .",

    "\\label{schro}\\ ] ]      path integrals were first introduced for representing the matrix elements of the evolution operator @xmath29 associated with schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "it was soon realized that a similar path integral representation for matrix elements of gibbs operator at inverse temperature @xmath30 can be inferred _ via _ the formal substitution @xmath31 .",
    "the latter representation for @xmath32 involves an integral over all paths @xmath33 going from @xmath34 to @xmath35 in a time @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , the corresponding integrand is the exponential factor @xmath36 $ ] , where @xmath37 is the action associated with path @xmath33 .",
    "that path integral is proved to be mathematically well defined for a large class of potentials .",
    "its convergence is indeed ensured , roughly speaking , by the gaussian - like decay of the kinetic part of @xmath36 $ ] for large paths ( on the contrary , path integrals for @xmath29 are , in general , ill - defined because they involve sums of oscillating phase factors ) .",
    "the genuine path integral representation of @xmath32 can be rewritten within the parametrization @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the dimensionless time in @xmath5 units , while @xmath40 is a brownian bridge satisfying boundary conditions @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the de broglie wavelength . on the one hand ,",
    "the kinetic part of @xmath36 $ ] then provides normalized wiener measure @xmath43 associated with the brownian bridge process . that gaussian measure is entirely defined by its first two moments @xmath44 on the other hand , the potential part of @xmath36 $ ] reduces to the boltzmann factor associated with time average of @xmath10 along path @xmath45 .",

    ", the wiener measure is intrinsic to brownian motion and does not depend on any physical parameter .",
    "expression  ( [ loopsproperty3 ] ) of the covariance implies that the typical extension of a brownian bridge is always of order @xmath48 .",
    "mass @xmath8 of the particle , as well as planck s constant @xmath1 only intervene in the de broglie wavelength @xmath49 .",
    "that length controls the size of quantum fluctuations , as shown by specifying ( [ fk ] ) to diagonal elements , i.e. @xmath50 in time - average @xmath51 , particle experiences the potential around position @xmath20 on a length scale obviously determined by @xmath49 , as illustrated in figure  [ deflambdadebroglie ] .    besides its interest for analytical or numerical calculations ( see below ) , feynman - kac representation is also quite useful for mapping a quantum system into a classical one  @xcite .",
    "indeed , formula  ( [ fkd ] ) can be reinterpreted in terms of a classical extended object , often called loop or polymer , defined by its position @xmath20 and its internal shape parametrized by @xmath52 .",
    "then , the r.h.s . of ( [ fkd ] ) is nothing but the statistical average of a boltzmann factor for the loop over its all possible shapes distributed according to wiener measure . that interpretation , which holds for any quantum system with an arbitrary number of particles , is the key starting point of above mapping .      at high temperatures ,",
    "the de broglie wavelength is small , so only paths which remain close to reference position @xmath20 contribute significantly to @xmath53 in ( [ fkd ] ) .",
    "therefore , the time - average of @xmath10 along path @xmath54 can be performed by replacing @xmath55 by its taylor series around @xmath56 @xmath57 ( we assume that @xmath10 is infinitely differentiable ) .",
    "if we keep only the first term in ( [ taylorv ] ) , which does not depend on @xmath40 , we immediately recover the familiar classical form of @xmath53 @xmath58,\\ ] ] where we have used normalization condition @xmath59 .",
    "since @xmath49 is proportional to @xmath1 , quantum corrections to ( [ classical ] ) are easily generated by a ( formal ) cumulant expansion of contributions associated with terms @xmath60 in ( [ taylorv ] ) .",
    "the resulting moments of wiener measure are then readily computed by wick s theorem which applies thanks to gaussian character of @xmath61 .",
    "this allows us to retrieve the well - known wigner - kirkwood expansion in powers of @xmath2 @xmath62.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] expansion  ( [ wk ] ) involves only even powers of @xmath1 , because all odd moments of gaussian wiener measure vanish by virtue of ( [ loopsproperty2 ] ) . that expansion is expected to be only asymptotic .",
    "present derivation within fk representation turns out to be much easier than usual approaches within wigner - distribution formalism ( see e.g ref .",
    "it might be used for calculating higher - order terms beyond @xmath2-correction ( terms up to order @xmath63 have been already determined in the literature  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it clearly emphasizes that ( [ wk ] ) is appropriate when the de broglie wavelength is much smaller than the typical length of variation of the potential .",
    "then , truncation of ( [ wk ] ) up to a few terms should provide accurate values of the density matrix , as checked below .    when the temperature decreases , the de broglie wavelength increases , so wigner - kirkwood expansion is no longer applicable . at the analytical level ,",
    "exact evaluations of the corresponding path integrals are not accessible in general , except for some simple models  @xcite .",
    "non - perturbative effects in @xmath1 can be partially accounted for through various methods , among which the celebrated semi - classical approximation described further .",
    "the reliability of such methods remains questionable since they do not involve any small control - parameter like ( [ wk ] ) .",
    "nonetheless , for numerical purposes , their accuracy may be satisfactory , at least at not too low temperatures .",
    "if analytic informations on the density matrix become rather difficult to extract from fk representation , accurate values can be still readily obtained at finite temperatures _ via _ direct numerical estimations of fk path integrals .",
    "a first possible route starts with the ( exact ) convolution relation @xmath64 with @xmath65 . for a sufficiently large value of @xmath66",
    ", each matrix element @xmath67 can be evaluated within fk formula  ( [ fk ] ) by neglecting the corresponding brownian deviation @xmath68 in the argument of  @xmath10 .",
    "the resulting time average @xmath69 can be itself replaced , with a similar accuracy , by @xmath70 ( middle - point convention ) for instance .",

    "we stress that ( [ convapprox ] ) becomes exact when @xmath73 .",
    "in fact , continuous path integration with wiener measure may be precisely defined in the framework of that limit process .",
    "a second route for direct numerical computations relies on the introduction of a set of @xmath66 simple functions @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) with @xmath76 , such that they define a basis for brownian bridges @xmath40 in the limit @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "numerical evaluations of ( [ fkd ] ) are then carried out by replacing the functional integration over paths by ordinary integrals over coefficients @xmath77 arising in the decomposition @xmath78 .",
    "that method provides satisfactory results by using only a few number @xmath66 of basis functions @xcite .",
    "similarly to the previous convolution method , it becomes exact when @xmath73 .",
    "when temperature goes to zero , @xmath49 diverges , so most paths explore a rather large region not restricted to the neighbourhood of reference position @xmath20 .",
    "a direct analysis of fk expression  ( [ fkd ] ) then becomes quite cumbersome .",
    "in particular , @xmath53 must behave as @xmath79},\\ ] ] which immediately follows from spectral representation of density matrix  ( [ scrho_dst_element ] ) .",
    "indeed , the groundstate obviously provides the leading contribution in the r.h.s . of ( [ scrho_dst_element ] ) .",
    "the factorization of position and temperature dependences in ( [ low_temp_assympt ] ) does not come out easily from fk formula  ( [ fkd ] ) , where both position and temperature are coupled in an absolutely non - trivial way . by the way ,",
    "notice that spectral representation  ( [ scrho_dst_element ] ) is not well suited at intermediate or high temperatures , because one has then to sum a large number of contributions associated with various eigenstates ( in particular , classical behaviour ( [ classical ] ) can not be straightforwardly recovered by using ( [ scrho_dst_element ] ) ) .",
    "when temperature becomes too small , previous computational methods become more difficult to handle accurately . even if some algorithmic tricks @xcite may significantly reduce calculation - times within a satisfactory accuracy",
    ", they do not provide a better understanding of low - temperature behaviours .",
    "let us consider a symmetric confining potential @xmath80 with a minimum located at @xmath81 .",
    "on the one hand , low - temperature behaviour ( [ low_temp_assympt ] ) of the corresponding density matrix is mainly determined by the local shape of @xmath80 over finite length scale @xmath82 , which characterizes the spatial extension of the groundstate wave function @xmath83 . on the other hand , for typical paths with size of order @xmath49 ,",

    "the previous analysis suggests that , at low temperatures , leading contributions to the r.h.s . of ( [ fkd ] )",
    "arise from paths with a spatial extension of order @xmath82 , i.e. from quite small brownian bridges with size @xmath91 of order @xmath92 . for such paths , time - average potential @xmath84 is of order @xmath93 , so the corresponding boltzmann factor indeed is of order @xmath90}$ ] .",
    "notice that , paths with very different shapes give raise to similar contributions , since the wiener weights of the associated brownian bridges remain of order ( roughly speaking ) @xmath94 . consequently , when the temperature decreases , only a very tiny subset of paths gives a relevant contribution to the r.h.s . of ( [ fkd ] ) .",
    "in other words , important paths are not any more typical but , on the contrary , they can be viewed as large deviations .",
    "this explains why direct numerical evaluations of ( [ fkd ] ) become rather difficult : the subset of important paths remains , in some sense , hidden in the entire configurational space .    in order to extract from ( [ fkd ] ) the relevant contributions at low temperatures , it is tempting to collect all paths with the same finite spatial extension , and then to sum over all possible extensions .",
    "that procedure is not easy to carry out directly in the r.h.s . of ( [ fkd ] ) , within a suitable partition of functional integration space over brownian bridges . as described below , it is more convenient to transform first the density matrix within the operator representation , by introducing an auxiliary hamiltonian which confines the particle inside a box with size @xmath3",

    "<S> we study the low temperature behaviour of path integrals for a simple one - dimensional model . starting from the feynman - kac formula , we derive a new functional representation of the density matrix at finite temperature , in terms of the occupation times of brownian motions constrained to stay within boxes with finite sizes . from that representation , we infer a kind of ergodic approximation , which only involves double ordinary integrals . </S>",
    "<S> as shown by its applications to different confining potentials , the ergodic approximation turns out to be quite efficient , especially in the low - temperature regime where other usual approximations fail . </S>"
