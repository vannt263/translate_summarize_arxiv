    "hubble space telescope ( hst ) , faint object camera ( foc ) images for the central regions of the s0/a galaxy ngc  2681 were obtained in four ultraviolet bands in 1993 , in the context of a project aimed at understanding the origin of uv emission from bulge - dominated galaxies . a point - like source  which we term _ spike _ for short  was evident at its center with a photometric profile being indistinguishable from the psf of the aberrated , pre - costar hst images @xcite .    motivated by the related discovery of the variable nature of the uv - bright spike in ngc  4552",
    ", whose flare has been interpreted as an accretion event onto a central supermassive black hole ( bh ) @xcite , we obtained additional foc imaging and faint object spectrograph ( fos ) spectra of the ngc  2681 spike in 1997 , this time with the costar - corrected optics of hst . unlike the case of ngc  4552",
    ", this latter set of hst observations did not reveal any variability of the central spike in ngc  2681 ( not surprising , as we show here that a possible uv flare of the same luminosity as seen in ngc  4552 would have escaped detection in ngc  2681 due to its steeper surface brightness profile ) .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that for this galaxy convincing evidence for a central bh comes instead from the modeling of the circumnuclear ionised gas kinematics derived from the fos spectrum , properly combined with foc photometry . in so doing",
    ", we find we can also place interesting constraints on origin of the young stellar population in the center of this galaxy . section  [ sec : observations ] presents the known information about ngc  2681 and the observations we obtained .",

    "ngc  2681 is a bulge - dominated s0/a galaxy at an estimated distance of 13.3 mpc @xcite , corresponding to a linear scale of @xmath6 pc arcsec@xmath7 and an absolute @xmath8 magnitude @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the value of the central magnesium index ( mg@xmath10=0.15 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is low compared to values typical of spheroids of comparable luminosity .",
    "the iue spectrum of this galaxy @xcite shows that the stellar population in its central region has a ultraviolet spectrum slowly decreasing towards shorter wavelengths , which is interpreted as evidence for a recent ( @xmath5 gyr ) burst of star formation @xcite .",
    "ngc  2681 has two concentric , misaligned bars @xcite as seen in ground based images .",
    "a third inner bar is seen in this galaxy in hst / nicmos images @xcite .",
    "this innermost bar is also seen in our higher resolution foc/96 images .",
    "note that ngc  2681 is viewed almost face - on and thus these structures can not be due to projection effects ( i.e. we can not misinterpret a change of flattening in an axisymmetric structure for a change of ellipticity due to a bar ) .    ground based @xmath11 color maps do not show evidence of a ring or a grand design spiral , although two barely visible , small spiral arms exist in the disk .",
    "based on our foc/96 images the , spiral structure pointed out by @xcite appears to extend to within the central few arcsecs of this galaxy .",
    "galactic absorption for this galaxy is @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "ground - based  images also reveal a few  regions and strong nuclear emission @xcite . @xcite has reported detection of centrally - concentrated emission ( @xmath13 ) via pa  @xmath14 imaging using hst / nicmos . on the basis of their spectroscopic optical observations ,",
    "@xcite classify the nucleus of this galaxy as a liner .",
    "fos / red detector spectra of the nucleus of ngc  2681 were obtained in 1997 , using the @xmath15 square aperture ( 0.25-pair ) .",
    "a complete log of fos observations is given in table  [ tab : fos_log ] .",
    "analysis of the fos acquisition steps assures us that the nucleus of ngc  2681 was correctly centered in the fos aperture ( with a 0025 accuracy ) .",
    "this is confirmed by the fact that the central flux measured within the fos aperture on our costar - corrected f342w foc/96 image agrees with the flux predicted for that foc filter from the fos g270h spectrum .",
    "foc observations of ngc  2681 include our own 1993 pre - costar and subsequent 1997 costar - corrected , foc/96 images .",
    "a detailed summary of the foc instrumental configurations and exposure times is given in table  [ tab : obs_log ] . in this work",
    "we also make use of an archival nicmos image taken on 1997 june 7 with the f160w ( space - based h - band ) , during one of the nic3 `` campaigns '' @xcite .",
    "the scale of this image is 02 pixel@xmath7 and the field of view ( fov ) is @xmath16 .",
    "all of the spectra and images used in this work have been de - archived and recalibrated using the most recent version of the stsci data pipeline and the latest calibration files .",
    "the combined fos nuclear spectrum of ngc  2681 is presented in figure  [ fig : fos_complete ] .",
    "clearly recognizable in absorption are the mg ii @xmath172800 , mg i @xmath172852 , and the balmer lines @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , as well as @xmath21 in emission .",
    "strong balmer absorption lines in the spectrum of a galaxy are , of course , indicative of a relatively young stellar component ( 12 gyr ) .",
    "this is consistent with the relative absorption line strengths of mg ii and mg i , which are indicative of a late a - type main sequence for the stars producing this spectrum @xcite , as well as with the interpretation of iue spectrum of this galaxy @xcite .",
    "also prominent are emission lines of the ]  @xmath172326 multiplet , [ ]  @xmath173727 , [ ]  @xmath176300 , [ ]  @xmath226548,6584 , and [ ]  @xmath226716,6731 .",
    "figure  [ fig : continuo ] shows a comparison between the nuclear fos spectrum of ngc  2681 and the spectrum for this galaxy within the @xmath23 iue aperture , both normalized to their respective visual fluxes .",
    "the iue aperture covers an area @xmath24 times larger than the fos aperture we used , and the fos flux contributes @xmath25 of the iue flux .",
    "this can be verified by comparing the uv flux in the fos and iue spectra @xcite . yet",
    ", the two spectra define the same kind of relatively young stellar population within combined errors of the iue spectrum ( 0.25 mag maximum error quoted by burstein et al . ) and the 5% relative error of the fos spectrum as quoted in the latest hst data handbook ( version 3 ) .",
    "the luminosity - weighted average radius within the fos aperture is @xmath26 , while for the iue aperture it is @xmath27 .",
    "the agreement between the iue and fos spectra thus gives strong evidence that little , or no color gradient exists for the stellar population in the center region of ngc  2681 . as a result",
    ", we conclude that whatever redleak does exist for the uv foc images , the lack of a color gradient justifies fitting the same two - dimensional light distribution to all the foc images and the nicmos image ( section  [ sec : focanalysis ] ) .",
    "interestingly , both the lack of any perceptible dust lanes seen in the foc images , combined with the lack of a color gradient seen in the iue to fos comparison , strongly suggest that the inner 0.6 kpc of ngc  2681 contains little dust .      the emission lines in our spectra have been analyzed by a `` template subtraction '' procedure as in @xcite .",
    "starting from the high s / n spectra of @xcite , we have used a minimization algorithm to construct an emission - line - free template for their ngc  2681 2@xmath284  aperture spectrum .",
    "the best match was obtained using a combination of their spectra of ngc  205 and ngc  4339 .",
    "we use this template to subtract the underlying stellar contribution from the lower s / n 02@xmath2802 fos spectrum .",
    "the upper panel of figure  [ fig : modeling ] illustrates the template subtraction from the g650l spectrum ( lacking any reliable emission ) , while the lower panel shows both the template subtraction and the subsequent fit to the prominent emission lines of the template - subtracted fos g780h spectrum .",
    "the emission lines in the continuum - subtracted optical fos spectrum have been modeled using the levenberg - marquardt algorithm @xcite to fit a sum of gaussian components to the observed spectrum .",
    "we adopt the minimum set of free parameters able to generate a satisfactory fit by assuming that all emission lines can be fit by a gaussian profile with the same redshift and the same velocity width within a given grating .",
    "the derived parameters for the emission lines are given in table  [ tab : line_modeling ] .",
    "the @xmath29 formal errors of the line parameters are estimated from the covariance matrix .",
    "the ]  emission line has also been fit in the g270h spectrum ( table  [ tab : line_modeling ] ) by assuming a linear template under the emission feature .",
    "the integrated @xmath30 [ ]  flux in our @xmath15 aperture is only a factor @xmath31 smaller than the flux measured by @xcite within a @xmath32 .",
    "given that the ratio of the two apertures is a factor @xmath33 , this small difference in the measured flux shows that the gaseous emission is very centrally concentrated and , in particular , comes mainly from a region not exceeding in size the fos aperture .",
    "figure  [ fig : diagnostics ] compares the emission line ratios obtained from our hst spectra of the nuclei of ngc  2681 and ngc  4552 @xcite , to those for seyfert galaxies , liners , and  galaxies from @xcite .",
    "note that the [ ]  and  fluxes were not measured from our g650l fos spectrum , as these lines have low @xmath34 in our data .",
    "rather , for these emission lines , we resort to the @xcite ground - based values",
    ". this choice can not affect the physical classification of ngc  2681 nucleus as most of the flux observed by ho et al",
    ". comes from a region within our hst aperture and  what is more  the basic discrimination on the agn / non - agn nature of the nucleus comes from our own ( fos ) emission line ratios .    as can be seen ,",
    "the nucleus of ngc  2681 is clearly classified as a liner from our fos spectroscopy , in accordance with the ground based classification of @xcite .",
    "we also note with interest that , despite the structural differences of the central regions of the two galaxies , the location of the innermost source of ngc  2681 is surprisingly close to that of the variable spike in ngc  4552 in these spectroscopic diagnostic diagrams .",
    "a rough estimate of the size of the line - emitting region can be obtained from the density as set by the forbidden lines , and by the  luminosity @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the volume occupied by the emitting gas , @xmath37 is the total luminosity of the h@xmath14 line , @xmath38 is the volume filling factor , @xmath39 is the electron density , @xmath40 @xmath41 s@xmath7 , @xmath42 is the planck constant and @xmath43 the frequency of the h@xmath14 line .    adopting @xmath44 from @xcite , a filling factor @xmath45 , a distance @xmath46 mpc @xcite , and spherical geometry ,",
    "we obtain @xmath47 erg s@xmath7 and a size of the emitting region @xmath48 pc ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "this estimate is within the upper limit imposed by the size of our fos aperture ( @xmath50 pc ) .",
    "the latter size would correspond to a much lower filling factor of @xmath51 .",
    "basic ingredients of the dynamical modeling we present later are the availability of a high resolution surface brightness profile of the galaxy , as well as observational support to the adopted hypothesis of a constant stellar mass - to - light ( m / l ) ratio .",
    "we show here that the data provided by the foc and nicmos images do assure both pieces of needed information .",
    "ideally , in order to obtain reliable surface brightness profiles and color gradients , one should correct the foc/96 images for nonlinearity effects in the foc @xcite , deconvolve all images with the psf and , finally , derive the photometric profiles and the corresponding color gradients from the corrected frames . however , in our case this process is numerically very unstable , owing both to the very low signal - to - noise ratio of the foc images and the approximations introduced by the nonlinearity correction which are greatly amplified by the deconvolution process .",
    "the similarity of the available fos and iue spectroscopy ( section  [ sec : spectroscopy ] ) strongly suggests a lack of detectable color gradient between @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "moreover , the good agreement between the @xmath54 ( foc / f342w ) and @xmath55 ( nicmos / f160w ) profiles in the radial range 110not affected by dark subtraction , nonlinearity and redleak effects  confirms the absence of any significant stellar population gradient in the central regions of this galaxy ( see figures  [ fig : nicmos ] ,  [ fig : foc ] ) . for these reasons we feel permitted to construct a _",
    "unique _ bi - dimensional photometric model of the center of ngc  2681 .",
    "the geometric properties of the model are fixed by imposing a match with the observed isophotes as obtained with the ` ellipse ` iraf task .",
    "the photometric profile is derived as a function of the free parameters given below .",
    "this model is then convolved with the proper psf  a normalized mean of both uv and red - leaked psfs constructed by means of tiny tim @xcite and weighted in accordance to a properly chosen energy distribution  taking correctly into account of nonlinearity effects ( for foc images alone ; see appendix of * ? ? ?",
    "the resulting model is then simultaneously fit by means of an iterative procedure to all the original images as given by the stsci pipeline ( with the exclusion of the highly nonlinear pixels with @xmath56 in the f342w 1993 image ) .",
    "a very good fit is achieved also for the far  uv passbands , ( figure  [ fig : foc ] ) , consistent with the lack of color gradients .",
    "however , only @xmath5750% of the detected flux in the three red - leak - affected foc filters ( f175w , f220w and f275w ) is genuinely uv light ( i.e. , falls within the filter fwhm , as one can verify by using their transmission curves and our own fos spectrum ) , thus weakening the importance of this latter outcome , when compared to the evidence quoted above . the perfect match obtained with both the 1993 and 1997 foc observations",
    "also assures that the nucleus of this galaxy has not significantly varied in surface brightness between the two epochs .",
    "however , it is worth mentioning that the foc / f342w profiles of ngc  2681 and ngc  4552 ( figure  [ fig : profiles_comparision ] ) show that the surface brightness of ngc  2681 close to the center is higher by @xmath58 mag arcsec@xmath59 than that of ngc  4552 for @xmath60 , before the variable spike starts dominating its luminosity . as a consequence",
    "the central uv surface brightness of ngc  2681 is so high that a uv flare of the luminosity seen in ngc  4552 would have not been detected with observations of the kind discussed here , leaving the ngc  2681 nucleus apparently quiescent for the observer .",
    "we find that a unique double power - law @xcite @xmath61 ^{-\\frac{\\beta-\\gamma}{\\alpha}},\\ ] ] with parameters @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 can reproduce all of the eight profiles ( see figures  [ fig : nicmos ] and [ fig : foc ] ) and also satisfy the constraint that the foc dark countrate ( which is also a free parameter for the foc frames ) remains within plausible ranges @xcite . here",
    "@xmath66 measures the steepness of the inner profile ( @xmath67 for @xmath68 ) , @xmath69 is the steepness of the outer profile ( @xmath70 for @xmath71 ) , @xmath14 is related to the sharpness of the transition and @xmath72 is the scale factor for luminosity .",
    "in the profiles a radius of 0.38 pixel  corresponding to the average radius within the central pixel  has been assigned to the central value of the surface brightness . due to the small fwhm and the good sampling of the psf in the uv",
    "our foc/96 non - aberrated uv images provide information down to the central @xmath73 pc of ngc  2681 .",
    "the profiles in figures  [ fig : nicmos ] and [ fig : foc ] represent the surface brightness in mag arcsec@xmath59 in the stmag magnitude system .",
    "the magnitude zeropoints  computed using the synphot package within iraf / stsdas  take into account the 1.27@xmath28 higher sensitivity of the foc zoomed mode , relative to the non - zoomed observations @xcite .",
    "it is evident from the profiles from the 1997 foc images ( figure  [ fig : foc ] , right panels ) that there is a change of slope of the observed profile around @xmath2 which is _ not _ reproduced by the model .",
    "this radius corresponds to the distance where the nucleus becomes more asymmetric ( see figure  [ fig : contours ] ) .",
    "this , in turn , suggests that some substructure could be present .",
    "however , no difference in color or spectral energy distribution is observed for this central feature , thus justifying our choice of resorting to a single component density profile when modeling the dynamics of the central regions .",
    "in order to construct a dynamical model of the innermost regions we need to extract a reliable intrinsic density profile , starting from the observed photometry . to this aim the analytic double power - law photometric profile derived in section  [ sec : focanalysis ] is deprojected by means of an abel inversion @xcite , under the assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "the profile is converted to the v - band using the color @xmath74 mag measured from the nuclear fos spectrum of figure  [ fig : fos_complete ] ( the stmag photometric system has the same zero point as that of the v magnitude band ) and applying a foreground extinction @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "the deprojected luminosity density profile in units of @xmath76 pc@xmath77 is presented in figure  [ fig : density ] .",
    "the derived density in the central pixel ( @xmath78 ) corresponds to @xmath79 @xmath76 pc@xmath77 .",
    "this is quite a high value for the central luminosity density . for comparison , for a sample of 41 spirals analyzed by @xcite ,",
    "the highest value of the density at 10 pc from the nucleus is a factor @xmath0 lower than the corresponding value we derive for ngc  2681 ( @xmath80 @xmath76 pc@xmath77 ) .",
    "velocity dispersion and rotation curve profiles are not available for ngc  2681 . moreover , as this galaxy contains three concentric bars @xcite , developing a fully three - dimensional model of its mass distribution is problematic , at best .",
    "however , experience has shown that , while detailed observations and general dynamical models are needed to establish the presence of possible bhs in galaxies , a simple isotropic dynamical model gives reasonable order of magnitude estimates of the bh parameters .",
    "a classic example is the @xmath81  bh in m87 inferred by @xcite using spherical isotropic models , an estimate reasonably close to the most recent values ( @xmath82 ) determined by @xcite and @xcite using hst spectra of the gaseous disk surrounding the nucleus of m87 .",
    "a detailed analysis of spherical models with cuspy power - law inner surface density profiles @xmath83 is available from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of isotropic power - law cuspy nuclei ( without bh ) are dramatically different , depending on whether @xmath84 or @xmath85 ( @xmath66 being the inner slope of the power - law ) . for the lower @xmath66 case , termed `` weak cusp '' by @xcite , the mean - squared line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath86 approaches zero near the center . for the other case ,",
    "termed the `` strong cusp '' regime , the relation @xmath87 diverges near the center ( finite resolution will actually transform these mathematical singularities to finite observable values if @xmath88 ) .    in either case , if a bh is present @xmath89 near the center .",
    "thus it is clear that , while with @xmath84 an increase of @xmath86 in the very inner regions ( @xmath90 ) is already an indication of a possible bh , this is not the case when @xmath85 , as is such for ngc  2681 ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "a bh becomes finally undetectable for @xmath92 , when its presence induces the same trend as a simple increase of the m / l stellar ratio .",

    "the central @xmath99 is found to increase by a factor of @xmath0 when narrowing the aperture from @xmath1 ( ground ) to @xmath2 ( hst / fos ) .    to investigate this further ,",
    "we have computed a simple spherical isotropic model for the stellar kinematics , starting from the double power - law photometric profile @xmath100 determined above , and assuming a constant stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath101 . with these assumptions",
    "the projected stellar velocity dispersion at a distance @xmath102 from the center can be predicted from the relation ( e.  g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath103 the stellar density @xmath104 and the mass within a given radius @xmath105 have been obtained from the deprojected double power - law profile .",
    "@xmath102 is the radial distance on the plane of the sky , while @xmath106 is the radial coordinate measured from the center of the galaxy . in the case",
    "a bh lies at the center of the galaxy we have to substitute the enclosed mass @xmath105 in equation  ( [ eq : sigma_p ] ) with the expression @xmath107 $ ] , where @xmath108 is the mass of the bh .",
    "in order to compare the predictions with the observations we calculate the velocity dispersion @xmath109 as measured through a circular aperture of radius @xmath102 _ centered on the galaxy nucleus _ ( seeing and psf effects are not modeled here , since they are smaller than the apertures used ) :",
    "@xmath110    we evaluate this equation for the two cases with and without a central bh . in the former case",
    "we impose that below @xmath111 ( the central resolution of our photometric _ model _ , corresponding to 0.38 foc/96 pixels ) the stellar density profile flattens , becoming constant ( an extreme assumption , which maximizes the possible bh mass ) .",
    "we do this in order to avoid the integral at the numerator in equation  ( [ eq : sigma_a ] ) diverging . to compare the models with the data we further assume that the gas behaves as a `` hot '' system , being in distinct clumps in isotropic motion , with a density proportional to the stellar density .",
    "this is appropriate if the gas is produced by the stars themselves , a not unreasonable assumption .",
    "figure  [ fig : dispersion ] shows the results of our modelling with the inclusion of a central bh of mass @xmath112  ( solid line ) and without it ( dotted line ) .",
    "it is apparent that a model without a bh can not explain the observations .",
    "however , we stress that , due to the above assumption on the flattening of the central density profile , the value @xmath113  represents a strict _ upper limit _ of the mass of a possible central bh in this galaxy . in this respect",
    ", one should be aware that only measurement of stellar kinematics using long slit stis spectra will permit us to remove the present degeneracy in the modelling of ngc  2681 .",
    "we also note that the ground - based data constrain @xmath114 to be 0.7 and 1.0 for the two above cases , i.e. with and without bh , respectively .",
    "a value @xmath115 is consistent with simple stellar population models of solar metallicity and ages 1 - 2 gyr , for both salpeter and scalo imf @xcite .",
    "the upper limit for the bh mass determined in this paper ( @xmath113 ) is consistent with the recent very tight correlation between the central velocity dispersion @xmath116 and the bh mass as given by @xcite .",
    "the central dispersion @xmath117  ( corrected to @xmath118 ) we observe for this galaxy , corresponds in fact to an expected bh mass of @xmath119 .",
    "we remark that in the above bh mass estimate we have modeled the gas as a `` hot '' system of point masses .",
    "this appears justified from the fact that within an @xmath1 aperture the dispersion observed from the gas and the stars is the same ( see figure  [ fig : dispersion ] ) .",
    "the gas motion however may become more ordered closer to the nucleus . as an extreme case , one could even assume that , at hst resolution , the gas lies in a thin disk in circular motion in the combined potential of the bh and the stellar potential .    to test this possibility we have tried to explain the observed emission line profile as produced by a thin gaseous disk using the techniques we have developed in @xcite , and subsequently integrating the model spectrum within the fos aperture . using different bh masses and various disk inclinations ,",
    "we have verified that , under the thin disk hypothesis , it becomes impossible to produce an emission line having the width @xmath120  observed with fos without producing a double peaked line profile .",
    "intrinsic dispersion in the gas is thus important and the disk can not be thin .",
    "this assures that the adopted spherical assumption for the geometry gives the correct order of magnitude estimate for the bh mass .",
    "our analysis of the light distribution in the inner 0.6 kpc of ngc  2681 shows that a double power law light profile fits its light distribution both in the nicmos images and in our set of foc/96 uv images .",
    "the good fit of the multiband data obtained with the _ same _ light distribution , coupled to the close similarity of our fos spectrum to the iue spectrum taken with a much larger aperture , argues against the presence of sizable color gradients in the center regions of ngc  2681 .",
    "a remarkable consequence of the steep , innermost profile of ngc 2681 is that it translates  when observed in the near - uv  into a central surface brightness some 4 mag arcsec@xmath59 higher than that of the recently identified uv - variable spike of ngc  4552 @xcite .",
    "this implies that a uv - bright flare of comparable luminosity as that observed at the center of ngc  4552 would escape detection in the nucleus of ngc  2681 .",
    "the fos spectrum of the central region reveals the presence of broad emission lines . comparison to ground",
    "based spectra shows that the gaseous emission is centrally concentrated , most of it coming from a region inside the central @xmath50  pc of ngc  2681 . on the basis of the observed ratio of the emission lines",
    ", the nucleus of ngc  2681 falls in the region of liners .",
    "this suggests a slow , steady feeding of a central bh .",
    "the presence of the bh is more strongly indicated by the increase of a factor @xmath0 of the gas velocity dispersion , when narrowing the aperture from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "such an increase can not be accounted for by the stellar potential alone , as derived by deprojecting the observed surface brightness profile .",
    "we also find that the gas in the inner regions of ngc  2681 is not supported by rotation , as in the case of a keplerian disk , but mainly by random motions .",
    "assuming that the gas can be modeled as a `` hot '' system , we derive a firm upper limit to the bh mass of @xmath113  from an isotropic dynamical model .",
    "such an estimate is consistent with the @xmath4 relation of @xcite and @xcite .    in this respect ,",
    "ngc  2681 , with a central velocity dispersion of 111  ( corrected to @xmath118 ) and a predicted bh mass @xmath119 , must be regarded as an object of particular interest as it falls in the still poorly populated low-@xmath99 region of the tight @xmath4 relation .",
    "one should be aware , however , that only the knowledge of the _ radial dependence _ of the velocity dispersion ( and not its central value alone , as is our current knowledge for ngc  2681 ) assures the possibility of pinpointing the bh mass in ngc  2681 instead of establishing its upper limit , as we have done here .",
    "to acquire such data requires hst / stis _ slit _ observations",
    ".    our dynamical models also indicate a stellar mass to light ratio for the central population of 0.7 - 1 , which is appropriate for a 1 - 2 gyr old , solar metallicity stellar population .",
    "this is fully consistent with previous iue and optical spectroscopy ( namely , the measured mg@xmath10 line strength index ) indicating that the population of this galaxy is dominated by _",
    "stars formed in a fairly - well defined starburst @xmath5 gyr ago @xcite .",
    "finally we remark that a hi survey of ngc  2681 and its associated galaxies would be highly desirable .",
    "such a survey might reveal evidence that ngc  2681 underwent a tidal interaction with another galaxy in the recent past , lending support to the hypothesis of a major merging event affecting what we see in the center of this galaxy today .",
    "on the one hand , ngc  2681 belongs to a galaxy group , an environment in which mergers are particularly favored to occur .",
    "on the other hand , ngc  2681 does not show clear signatures of the recent accretion of a gas - rich dwarf , such as morphological distortions or duplicity of the nucleus .",
    "while the presence of a uniform , dustless , young stellar population in its central 0.6  kpc is puzzling , perhaps we can view ngc  2681 as the older brother of m82 , seen face - on , after the star burst has run its course .",
    "mc is grateful to the european southern observatory for its kind hospitality in the period during which much of the hst data analysis has been completed .",

    "<S> the nucleus of the bulge - dominated , multiply - barred s0/a galaxy ngc  2681 is studied in detail , using high resolution hubble space telescope foc and nicmos imaging and fos spectroscopy . </S>",

    "<S> the emission line ratios place the nucleus of ngc  2681 among liners . </S>",
    "<S> it is likely that the emission line region comes from a rather mild , but steady , feeding of gas to the central bh in this galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the inner stellar population lacks any measurable color gradient ( to a radius of 0.6 kpc ) from the infrared to the ultraviolet , consistently with foc , fos and iue data , all indicating that this system underwent a starburst @xmath5 gyr ago that encompassed its whole interior , down to its very center . </S>",
    "<S> the most likely source of such a widely - distributed starburst is the dumping of tidally - extruded gas from a galaxy neighbor . </S>",
