    "the discoveries of ternary rare earth ( re ) chevrel phases remo@xmath0s@xmath1 and rerh@xmath2b@xmath2 @xcite compounds with regular distribution of localized magnetic moments of re atoms have proved conclusively the coexistence of various types of magnetism with superconductivity .",
    "intensive experimental and theoretical research has shown that 4f electrons of re atoms responsible for magnetism and 4d electrons of molybdenum chalcogenide or rhodium boride clusters responsible for superconductivity are spatially separated and therefore their interaction is weak . in many of these systems superconductivity coexists rather easily with antiferromagnetic order , where usually the neel temperature @xmath3 is lower than the critical temperature for superconductivity @xmath4 . for almost two decades",
    "the problem of the interaction between magnetism and superconductivity has been overshadowed by high temperature superconductivity ( hts ) found in copper oxides .",
    "however , the discovery of the magnetic order in ru - based superconductors @xcite inspired a return to the so - called coexistence phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity was studied in d - electron uge@xmath5@xcite and zrzn@xmath5@xcite , where itinerant ferromagnetism may coexist with superconductivity , and in heavy fermion upd@xmath5al@xmath6@xcite , where magnetic excitons are present in the superconducting phase .",
    "the recent discovery of the iron pnictide superconductors @xcite have triggered broad interest in the mechanism of the coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity in this new class of superconductors @xcite .",
    "they exhibit qualitative similarity to cuprates in that superconductivity occurs upon carrier doping ( electrons , in this case ) of pristine compounds that exhibit magnetism @xcite .    among classic magnetic superconductors ,",
    "the chevrel phases have been studied most intensively .",
    "these compounds are mainly polycrystalline materials .",
    "however , some specific effects can be measured only on single crystals .",
    "one such effect is a two - step flux penetration process , predicted in ref.@xcite and after that discovered in the antiferromagnetic superconductor ( bct ) errh@xmath2b@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "later it was observed also in dymo@xmath0s@xmath1 .",
    "that specific effect is a consequence of creation of the spin - flop ( or metamagnetic ) domain along the vortex core .",
    "consider as an example antiferromagnet with two magnetic sublattices .",
    "an infinitesimal magnetic field applied perpendicular to its easy axis makes the ground state unstable against the phase transformation to the canted phase ( spin - flop ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the magnetic field is applied parallel to the easy axis the antiferromagnetic configuration is stable up to the thermodynamic critical field @xmath7 .",
    "when the field is further increased a canted phase develops in the system .",
    "assume that in the antiferromagnetic superconductor the lower critical field fulfils the relation @xmath8 and that the external field,@xmath9 , is applied parallel to the easy axis .",
    "then the superconducting vortices appear in the ground antiferromagnetic state .",
    "if the field is increased above @xmath10 in the core originates the phase transition to the canted phase because the field intensity in the core doubles the intensity of the external field  @xcite .",
    "the spatial distribution of the magnetic field of the vortex is a decreasing function of the distance from the center of the vortex .",
    "hence the magnetic field intensity in the neighborhood of the core is less then @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , the rest of the vortex remains in the antiferromagnetic configuration .",
    "the radius of spin flop domain grows as the external field is increased .",
    "thus , in the considered model there are two distinct types of vortices .",
    "possible candidate of such system might be @xmath11 , however , the features described in this paper have not yet been experimentally investigated . that compound has tetragonal unit cell with small orthorombic distortion in the @xmath12 plane .",
    "the @xmath13 ions form two sublattices antiferromagnetic structure of magnetic moments laying parallel and antiparallel to the @xmath14 direction @xcite .",
    "we shall use in this paper an abstract structure which resembles the above mentioned structure of @xmath11 .",
    "it consists of the superconducting layers of thickness @xmath15 and the isolating layers of thickness @xmath16 , @xmath17 . in the isolating layers ,",
    "the magnetic moments are running parallel and antiparallel to the @xmath14 direction ( easy axis ) .",
    "the magnetic field aligned parallel to the conducting planes makes the vortex lattice accommodate itself to the layer structure so that the vortex cores are lying between the superconducting sheets .",
    "the structure of a vortex lying in the @xmath18 plane in a layered superconductor with josephson coupling between adjacent layers resembles the abrikosovs one except that the order parameter does not vanish anywhere @xcite .",
    "instead there exists a region where the josephson current @xmath19 is of the order of the critical current . in this region , named the phase core , the london model fails as in the classic superconductor .",
    "away from the phase core the streamlines of the shielding supercurrents , which also represents contours of constant magnetic field , are elliptical except for the zigzags , shown in fig .",
    "(  [ fig1 ] ) , due to the intervening insulating layers .",
    "plane along the @xmath20-axis ( @xmath21-axis ) .",
    "the sf domain induced along the phase core is shown in the gray area.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "a current density @xmath22 , flowing along the planes perpendicular to the applied magnetic field exerts a lorentz force on the vortices in the @xmath23 direction so that intrinsic pinning barriers are formed on superconducting layers .",
    "the experimental evidence of quantum tunnelling is based on the fact that the magnetic moment relaxation rate exhibits two types of behavior as a function of temperature . above a characteristic temperature @xmath24 in the thermal activation regime",
    "the decay rate is of the arrhenius type @xmath25 .",
    "below @xmath24 , the decay rate is assumed _ a priori_to be essentially independent of temperature @xmath26 and is interpreted as arising from the quantum tunneling of vortices through intrinsic pinning potential @xcite . in the following",
    "we show a considerable change of tunneling rate and crossover temperature due to the sf phase formation in the vortex core .",
    "we shall assume that the vortex line is a straight string - like object , with effective mass @xmath27 per unit length , moving in a metastable intrinsic pinning potential @xmath28 and exposed to continuous deformation @xmath29 in the @xmath30 direction .",
    "the magnetic field is applied in @xmath20 direction .",
    "following caldeira and leggett @xcite the vortex is coupled to a heat - bath reservoir of harmonic oscillators interacting linearly with the vortex . in the semi - classical approximation the quantum decay rate is calculated as a saddle - point solution ( bounce ) of the euclidean action @xmath31 for the string @xmath32 here @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the viscosity coefficient and @xmath35 denotes imaginary time .",
    "the pinning potential @xmath28 consists of intrinsic periodic part and the lorentz potential : @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes critical depinning current . for large current",
    ", this potential can be expanded around the inflection point to give @xmath38 , \\label{eq3}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 may be thought as the height and width of the barrier ( because @xmath41 ) , and @xmath37 is the critical depinning current . the last term in eq.([eq1 ] ) is so called caldeira - leggett action , which describes ohmic damping produced by the coupling to harmonic oscillators .",
    "the line tension @xmath42 is different for vortices in two different orientations ( @xmath14 and @xmath43 ) in the @xmath18 plane . in the semiclassical approximation",
    "the decay rate is given by the value of the action on a classical trajectory obtained from the euler - lagrange equations of the motion @xcite .",
    "@xmath44 in the thermal regime @xmath45 the classical trajectory @xmath46 gives the activation energy @xmath47 from the static solution of the following equation @xmath48 below the crossover temperature @xmath49 a new kind of trajectory , periodic in the imaginary time , develops .",
    "therefore , @xmath50 can be expanded in the fourier series with matsubara frequencies @xmath51 substituting this expansion into eq.([eq3 ] ) and linearizing potential around the static solution @xmath46 one obtains @xmath52 upon introducing new variables @xmath53 + and @xmath54 the static equation now reads .",
    "@xmath55 its solution is easily found to be @xmath56 substitution eq.(6 ) into eq.(4 ) results in the following equation @xmath57 where @xmath58 eq.([eq9 ] ) has three discrete eigenvalues : @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "the negative one determines the crossover temperature @xmath60 in the thermally activated region above @xmath61 we use the static solution of eq.([eq5 ] ) and get the action @xmath62 which arises only from the elastic and pinning terms of eq.([eq1 ] ) .",
    "the action @xmath63 is then given by : @xmath64 below @xmath61 , the predominant mechanism of the decay of the meta - stable state is the quantum - mechanical tunneling , and the action on the bounce trajectory determines the rate of this process . to include contributions of effective mass and viscous damping in the bounce action it is necessary to go beyond the harmonic approximation in eq.([eq7 ] ) and substitute for @xmath50 the leading terms in the matsubara frequencies .",
    "calculations are performed in the vicinity of crossover temperature so the perturbation parameter is @xmath65 .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath66 are of the order @xmath67 and the leading - order contribution comes from @xmath68 . substituting this term for @xmath69 in eq.([eq1 ] ) one can obtain the total action for the bounce trajectory involving contribution of the inertial mass and the viscous damping .",

    "the above calculations apply to both kind of vortices characterized by different effective masses , line tensions and viscosity coefficients .",
    "we shall calculate these parameters as functions of condensation energy accumulated in the vortex cores . for the stationary flux flow the viscous force @xmath71 is equal to lorentz force . the electric field generated by the moving vortex",
    "is @xmath72 , so we get @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the normal phase resistivity in the @xmath18 plane and @xmath75 is the upper critical field parallel to the layers . finally , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is calculated from the constitutive relation @xmath78 .",
    "a moving vortex in the magnetic superconductor can transfer energy to the magnetic moments by emitting spin waves .",
    "this energy transfer gives rise to magnetic contribution to the mass and viscosity of the vortex @xcite .",
    "however the vortex velocity for this effect to occur should exceed the velocity of the spin wave which is not the case during the flux creep .",
    "the effective mass of the vortex can be deduced from the work of suhl@xcite .",
    "he derived the core contribution to the inertial mass @xmath79 , where @xmath80 denotes the mass of the electron and @xmath81 the fermi energy , and the electromagnetic contribution coming from the energy of the electric field induced by the moving flux .",
    "simple estimation shows that this contribution in layered superconductors is @xmath82 of the core contribution .",
    "therefore , @xmath83 the vortices in two main orientations in the @xmath18 plane have different line tensions . these lying parallel to @xmath43 direction and laying in the @xmath14 direction , but created in the magnetic field less then @xmath84 ,",
    "have the line tension @xmath85 , and the ones lying in the @xmath14 direction but possessing sf domain have the line tension @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath89 is the magnetic moment of the sf domain inside the vortex and @xmath7 is the thermodynamic critical field for spin - flop transformation . in order to evaluate the above line tensions it is necessary to calculate @xmath7 and @xmath89 . therefore a following argumentation is proposed . at low fields , in the vicinity of the lower critical field @xmath90 ,",
    "the intensity of the field in the vortex core is @xmath91  @xcite . when the external field is increased , the intensity of the magnetic field in the vortex core increases due to the superposition of the fields of the surrounding vortices .",
    "the field intensity in the core must reach @xmath92 in order to originate a transition to the sf phase .",
    "thus , taking into account only @xmath93 nearest neighbors we can write for the nonunilateral triangular lattice @xmath94 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 2\\varepsilon_b + o\\left(\\varepsilon_b\\right ) , \\label{eq18}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 is the lattice constant . although there are no precise measurements of the spin - flop transition in the antiferromagnetic high temperature superconductors , we assume that @xmath96 .",
    "the typical value of @xmath97 per @xmath13 ion per unit cell in @xmath11 @xcite gives @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "since @xmath100 and @xmath101 we obtain : @xmath102 it is possible now to relate the viscosity coefficient eq.([eq15 ] ) and the mass of the vortex eq.([eq16 ] ) to its line tension eq.([eq17 ] ) .",
    "@xmath103 and @xmath104 with the use of a simple consideration we can estimate the change of @xmath105 due to the creation of spin - flop domain along the vortex @xmath106 where the fourier transform of the compression modulus is given by @xcite @xmath107 by taking @xmath108 the estimation of the integral gives @xmath109 in the @xmath14 direction , however , we have an additional contribution from the magnetic domain @xmath110 , so we get @xmath111 and finally @xmath112 .",
    "consider a hollow cylindrical sample of the radius @xmath113 , and wall thickness @xmath114 ( thin wall approximation ) .",
    "the sample is placed in a magnetic field directed parallel to the axis of the cylinder and along the superconducting layers .",
    "a trapped flux in the system is @xmath115 , where @xmath116 denotes the field inside the hole of the sample and @xmath117 outside the sample respectively .",
    "the motion of the flux is triggered off by an activation process in which segments of the flux line tunnel through an intrinsic pinning potential to the neighboring interlayer spacing . by applying faraday s law",
    "we can easily calculate the electric field in the sample due to the change of the trapped flux @xmath118 which is equal to the mean electric field associated with the motion of vortices @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the length of the sample in the direction of the applied field , and @xmath121 is the activation probability per unit volume and unit time .",
    "as is shown in @xcite activation probability in the weak damping approximation is equal to @xmath122 . combining all above together",
    "we get @xmath123 where @xmath124 ; @xmath125 , and @xmath126 is the length of the sample along the flow of the current .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to derive expressions for the bounce contribution to the action arising from the inertial mass term , elastic and pinning terms , and the damping term .",
    "as was mentioned previously , in antiferromagnetic superconductors may occur vortices of two type .",
    "one type quite similar to the vortices in nonmagnetic superconductor and the other one possessing a ferromagnetic - like domain around and inside the core .",
    "what distinguishes these vortices in the present calculations is their line tension eq.([eq19 ] ) and critical depinning current eq.([eq23 ] ) .",

    "dashed line depicts vortices possessing magnetic cores.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the results are consistent with the experimental findings for the ybco class superconductors @xcite . as we can see , the creep is slower when vortices possessing magnetic domain occurred in the system .",
    "another important effect is that the action and hence activation energy is rendered temperature dependent so that the quantum tunneling rate becomes temperature dependent below the crossover temperature .",
    "another conclusion follows from the above considerations .",
    "the creep regime can be altered at fixed temperature .",
    "it is possible that the system leaps over from quantum to thermal creep regime , or vice versa , when the direction or intensity of the applied magnetic field is changed .        to see how it can happen",
    "let us fix the temperature of the sample somewhere in the range @xmath142 , as shown in fig.([fig5 ] ) , and increase magnetic field intensity in the @xmath14 direction to the point marked a. now the system is in thermal creep regime .",
    "then we change the direction of external field from @xmath14 to @xmath43 direction .",
    "the system now leaps over to the point b and finds itself in the quantum creep regime .",
    "doing the same operation in the reverse order one enforces the system to crossover from quantum to thermal creep .",
    "another scenario is also possible .",
    "when magnetic field is applied along @xmath14 direction and the temperature is fixed in the interval @xmath142 , the increase of magnetic field intensity above @xmath10 enforces the appearance of magnetic structure in vortices , and changes the quantum activation to thermal one . lowering the field intensity",
    "one can change back the creep from thermal to quantum regime .",
    "the described scenario could be named a `` creep valve '' because creep rate can be decreased or increased by means of sweeping the field around the @xmath10 value .",
    "we discussed quantum tunneling of vortices in layered high temperature superconductor .",
    "when the damping and inertial mass of the vortex are considered , the calculation shows that the activation energy is rendered temperature dependent so that the quantum tunnelling rate becomes temperature dependent below the crossover temperature . in the mixed state of layered superconductor",
    "the antiferromagnetic order of magnetic ions can create the spin - flop domains along the phase cores of the josephson vortices , and this effect makes an impact on the creep rate in superconductor .",
    "the activation of the creep at fixed temperature can be either thermal or quantum depending on the intensity of the applied magnetic field .",
