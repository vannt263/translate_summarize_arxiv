    "the identification of the higgs boson(s ) is one of the main goals of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) being built at cern .",
    "there are expectations that there exists a ` light ' higgs boson with mass @xmath3  gev . in this mass range",
    ", its detection at the lhc will be challenging .",
    "there is no obvious perfect detection process , but rather a range of possibilities , none of which is compelling on its own .",
    "some of the processes are listed in table  1 , together with the predicted event rates for the integrated luminosity of 30  fb@xmath4 expected over the first two or three year period of lhc running .",
    "we see that , _ either _ large signals are accompanied by a huge background , _ or _",
    "the processes have comparable signal and background rates for which the number of higgs events is rather small .    here",
    "we wish to draw particular attention to process  ( c ) , which is often disregarded ; that is the exclusive signal @xmath5 , where the +  sign indicates the presence of a rapidity gap .",
    "it is possible to install proton taggers so that the ` missing mass ' can be measured to an accuracy @xmath6  gev @xcite .",
    "then the exclusive process will allow the mass of the higgs to be measured in two independent ways .",
    "first the tagged protons give @xmath7 and second , via the @xmath1 decay , we have @xmath8 , although now the resolution is much poorer with @xmath9  gev .",
    "the existence of matching peaks , centered about @xmath10 , is a unique feature of the exclusive diffractive higgs signal .",
    "besides its obvious value in identifying the higgs , the mass equality also plays a key role in reducing background contributions .",
    "another advantage of the exclusive process @xmath11 , with @xmath1 , is that the leading order @xmath12 background subprocess is suppressed by a @xmath13 selection rule @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the radiation associated with the @xmath14 hard subprocess is not the only way to populate and to destroy the rapidity gaps .",
    "there is also the possibility of soft rescattering in which particles from the underlying event populate the gaps .",
    "the probability , @xmath15 , that the gaps survive the soft rescattering was calculated using a two - channel eikonal model , which incorporates high mass diffraction @xcite . including this factor , and the nlo @xmath16 factor ,",
    "the cross section is predicted to be @xcite @xmath17 for the production of a standard model higgs boson of mass 120  gev at the lhc ) at the tevatron , 0.2  fb , is too low to provide a viable signal . ] .",
    "it is estimated that there may be a factor two uncertainty in this prediction @xcite .",
    "the event rate in entry  ( c ) of table  1 includes a factor 0.6 for the efficiency associated with proton tagging , 0.6 for @xmath18 and @xmath19 tagging , 0.5 for the @xmath20 jet polar angle cut , @xmath21 , ( necessary to reduce the @xmath2 qcd background ) and 0.67 for the @xmath1 branching fraction @xcite .",
    "hence the original @xmath22 events is reduced to an observable signal of 11 events , as shown in table  1 .",
    "the advantage of the @xmath23 signal is that there exists a @xmath13 selection rule , which requires the leading order @xmath24 background subprocess to vanish in the limit of massless quarks and forward outgoing protons limit , the two born - level diagrams ( figs .",
    "2(a , b ) _ without _ the emission of the gluon ) cancel each other . ] .",
    "however , in practice , lo background contributions remain .",
    "the prolific @xmath25 subprocess may mimic @xmath2 production since we may misidentify the outgoing gluons as @xmath18 and @xmath19 jets .",
    "assuming the expected 1% probability of misidentification , and applying @xmath21 jet cut , gives a background - to - signal ratio @xmath26 .",
    "secondly , there is an admixture of @xmath27 production , arising from non - forward going protons which gives @xmath28 .",
    "thirdly , for a massive quark there is a contribution to the @xmath13 cross section of order @xmath29 , leading to @xmath26 , where @xmath30 is the transverse energy of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 jets .",
    "next , we have the possibility of nlo @xmath31 background contributions . of course",
    ", the extra gluon may be observed experimentally and these background events eliminated . however , there are exceptions .",
    "the extra gluon may go unobserved in the direction of a forward proton .",
    "this background may be effectively eliminated by requiring the equality @xmath32 .",
    "then we may have soft gluon emission .",
    "first , we note that emission from an outgoing @xmath18 or @xmath19 is not a problem , since we retain the cancellation between the crossed and uncrossed graphs .",
    "emission from the virtual @xmath18 line is suppressed by at least a factor of @xmath33 ( in the amplitude ) , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the energies of the outgoing soft gluon and an outgoing @xmath18 quark in the @xmath24 centre - of - mass frame .",
    "the potential danger is gluon emission from an incoming gluon , see fig .  2 .",
    "the first two diagrams no longer cancel , as the @xmath2 system is in a colour - octet state .",
    "however , the third diagram has precisely the colour and spin structure to restore the cancellation .",
    "thus soft gluon emissions from the initial colour - singlet @xmath36 state factorize and , due to the overriding @xmath13 selection rule , qcd @xmath2 production is still suppressed .",
    "the remaining danger is large angle hard gluon emission which is collinear with either the @xmath18 or @xmath19 jet , and therefore unobservable .",
    "if the cone angle needed to separate the @xmath37 jet from the @xmath18 ( or @xmath19 ) jet is @xmath38 then the expected background from unresolved three jet events leads to @xmath39 .    the nnlo @xmath40 background contributions are found to be negligible ( after requiring @xmath41 ) , as are soft pomeron - pomeron fusion contributions to the background ( and to the signal )  @xcite .",
    "so , in total , double - diffractive higgs production has a signal - to - background ratio of about three , after including the @xmath16 factors .",
    "identifying a ` light ' higgs will be a considerable experimental challenge .",
    "all detection processes should be considered . from table  1",
    "we see that valuable information can be obtained from weak boson fusion , where the higgs and the accompanying jets are produced at high @xmath42 .",
    "for example , process  ( d ) is based on the @xmath43 decay for which the background is small @xcite , whereas process  ( f ) exploits rapidity gaps so that the larger @xmath1 signal may be isolated @xcite , provided the pile - up problems can be overcome @xcite .",
    "here we have drawn attention to the exclusive @xmath11 signal , process  ( c ) .",
    "the process has the advantage that the signal exceeds the background .",
    "the favourable signal - to - background ratio is offset by a low event rate , caused by the necessity to preserve the rapidity gaps so as to ensure an exclusive signal .",
    "nevertheless , entry  ( c ) of table  1 shows that the signal has reasonable significance in comparison to the standard @xmath44 and @xmath45 search modes .",
    "moreover , the advantage of the matching higgs peaks , @xmath46 , can not be overemphasized .",
