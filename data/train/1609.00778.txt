    "<S> the current paper is the second one of our project , which is an investigation of spaces of high dimensional string links . in the first one we showed that when the dimensions are in the stable range , the rational homology and homotopy of these latter spaces can be calculated as the homology of a direct sum of certain finite colored graph - complexes that we described explicitly . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we compute the generating function of the euler characteristics of the summands in the homological and homotopical splitting . as a byproduct result of these computations </S>",
    "<S> we also determine the supercharacter of the symmetric group action on the positive arity components of the modular envelop of @xmath0 . </S>"
