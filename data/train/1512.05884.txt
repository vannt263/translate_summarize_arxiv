    "this approach allows a straight forward treatment of coherent time delayed quantum feedback , with a drastic reduction of numerical effort .",

    "in this section , we give three examples for analytically solvable coherent quantum self - feedback models .",
    "these models are an important benchmark for numerical implementations and contain the basic features of quantum feedback .",

    "we derive the necessary equations of motion and benchmark our method with the analytical solutions from the previous section .",
    "hereby , we gain insight into the mechanism that leads e.g. to the stabilization of the rabi oscillations .",
    "we start with the hamiltonian , where the emitter is coupled to a cavity mode and the cavity mode couples to the radiative continuum , leading to a decay of the cavity mode as well as to feedback .",
    "first , we solve the bilinear hamiltonian in the heisenberg equation of motion approach @xmath41 $ ] with @xmath42 being an arbitrary , non - explicitly time dependent operator @xmath43 .",
    "the equation of motion ( eom ) for the reservoir operator @xmath44 is derived via the heisenberg equation of motion : @xmath45 formally integrating yields : @xmath46 so , we can include the reservoir interaction by plugging this solution into the equation of motion of the system boson operator : @xmath47 the function @xmath48 includes the structure of the reservoir and can be evaluated as the operator is independent of the wave number @xmath49 : @xmath50 if @xmath51 , the function yields @xmath52 with the definition for the loss coefficient .",

    "this can be justified by assuming a structured continuum initially in the vacuum state and by keeping throughout the calculation the normal - ordering .",

    "however , due to the linear coupling , the photon statistics is not changed and feedback does not provide more than a excitation exchange between the cavity and the continuum . in the next section , we calculate a more complex problem and demonstrate , that feedback can lead to a stabilization of rabi oscillations between an emitter and the cavity mode .      to illustrate the method , we reproduce within the heisenberg picture the solution given in . for this scenario ,",

    "we presented a heisenberg operator method for the description of photon feedback in the quantum limit . based on a time - delayed feedback equation for the photon coherence , that was derived via the elimination of the feedback reservoir",
    ", the dynamics of the system can be calculated by a set of time - correlated expectations values , and can be computed separately for each time interval . here , the memory of the system leading to the photon feedback is calculated on the fly .",
    "as the sets of equations corresponding to a certain time interval only couple to distinctive quantities of the previous and only the previous time interval , memory carrying time - correlators to be stored just grow for the given example linearly with the index of the @xmath85-intervals .",
    "this results in an extreme reduction of the numerical effort compared with the incorporation of the reservoir sums , while still bearing all the memory information . the great advantage of the operator method , however , is that it is accessible for the description of more complex systems and with multiple excitations and different statistical properties . as a first outlook , we employed a excitation manifold factorization and showed , that the heisenberg operator method paves the way to describe efficient and intuitively many - photon quantum feedback .",
