    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , based on the theory of electroweak and strong interactions , provides a solid basis for measurements in high energy physics .",
    "the experiments at particle colliders lep , hera , tevatron and many others have proven the validity of the sm and measured its parameters .",
    "however , the sm can not be considered as a complete theory , since it does nt include gravity , the forth fundamental force , and contains too many free parameters , only few of them are measured to better than 1% accuracy .",
    "the new proton - proton collider lhc will produce a large amount of experimental data , which , due to extremely high luminosity , will have small statistical uncertainty on measurements for most of the production processes .",
    "however , since the center of mass energy of modern accelerators is far below the planck scale , one might have to look at small deviations of experimental distributions from the sm predictions to find signals of new particles or interactions .",
    "the understanding of the both theoretical and experimental uncertainties will be the key for a discovery .",
    "the calculation of cross - sections at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in qcd involves numerical integration over the phase space of the final state partons in order to cancel the infra - red and collinear divergences .",
    "since the convergence of such a calculation in certain parts of phase space might be slow , the integration of cross sections for observables at deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments or hadron - hadron colliders requires a time consuming generation of a large number of event weights in order to achieve low statistical uncertainty in theory prediction .",
    "moreover , in the iterative pdf fit procedure or for the estimation of the uncertainty in the prediction due to pdfs , @xmath1 and/or scale choice uncertainties , the full calculation needs to be repeated over and over again .",
    "nevertheless , the factorisation of a cross section into long - distance pdfs and short - distance matrix elements ( me ) allows to fill the latter into look - up tables ( grids ) binned in incoming partons momentum fraction and the characteristic scale of the production process during the time consuming evaluation and use it later on for the fast calculation of the theory predictions a posteriori . several approaches exploiting this idea",
    "@xcite have developed independently .",
    "the other possibility is the use of the ratio of nlo to leading order ( lo ) cross sections ( k - factor ) .",
    "such a factor , being calculated once , could be used to rescale the relatively fast calculation of lo cross section to mimic the nlo result , however , this method is only an approximation .",
    "this contribution describes the applgrid  method @xcite and shows its usage for the evaluation of the theory uncertainties in the inclusive jet cross section in proton - proton collisions at 7  tev centre - of - mass energy .",
    "in a typical calculation of the cross section of production process @xmath2 at nlo the integration over the process phase space is replaced by the summation of the me weights @xmath3 over the set @xmath4 of kinematical configurations of partons factorised in the initial state hadrons with the momentum fractions @xmath5 at the scale @xmath6 : @xmath7    in general there are @xmath8 different combinations of initial state partons contributing to an observable , however , due to the symmetries of the me weights , one can define a set of sub - processes and group the pdfs into  generalised ",
    "pdfs @xmath9 where index @xmath10 denotes the sub - process .",
    "pdfs are , of course , depend on the process and the perturbative order .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath11boson production one could define two sub - processes at lo and six at nlo @xcite .    in the beginning of the evaluation of sum ( [ xs ] )",
    "the three - dimensional @xmath12 look - up tables in @xmath13 phase space ( @xmath14 are user defined ) are created . instead of using directly the parton momentum fraction @xmath15 and parton resolution scale @xmath16 the following variable transformation",
    "is applied @xmath17 this transformation provides equidistant binning in regions of phase space , where the pdfs are steeply falling .",
    "the parameter @xmath18 should be chosen of the order of @xmath19 , but need not necessarily be identical , the parameter @xmath20 serves to increase the density of points in the large @xmath15 region ( @xmath21 are user defined ) .    assumming that continious parton density function could be represented by the lagrange interpolation @xmath22 over @xmath23 and @xmath24 nodes in @xmath25grid with sufficient precision , the sum ( [ xs ] )",
    "could be rewritten such @xmath26 that interpolation is performed during the event loop over the pqcd weights rather than over pdfs . here",
    "@xmath27 was assumed for simplicity , but this is not the fundamental limitation , since the observable scale dependence could be fully addressed a posteriori .",
    "the applgrid  library works as an interface , which interpolates the pqcd coefficients @xmath28 over @xmath29 nodes of look - up table and fills the grid structure with one 3d - table per sub - process , perturbative order and observable bin .    after the evaluation of the sum ( [ xs ] ) the grid structure is written out to a root file .",
    "the applgrid  library provides the methods for convolution ( using the eq .",
    "[ convolution ] ) of the pqcd coefficients stored in the grid with any choice of pdf set , @xmath1 and scales choice . depending on the grid size and pdf set",
    "the convolution time is @xmath30 , since it is already just a simple sum of real numbers and not the evaluation of divergent integrals .",
    "the choice of the grid architecture depends on the required accuracy , on the exact cross - section definition and on the available computer resources .",
    "the most critical parameter is the number of @xmath15-bins , which must be large enough to accommodate strong pdf variations .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the grid reproduces the original calculation with the precision better than @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "in this section we describe the use of applgrid  for the estimation of theory uncertainty on the example of single inclusive jet production of jets with radius @xmath33 for @xmath34 defined by the anti-@xmath35 jet algorithm @xcite in several bins of jet rapidity .",
    "the cross section was calculated using nlojet++ @xcite with the renormalisation and factorisation scales equal to the @xmath36 of the leading jet .",
    "figure [ fig : singleinclusiveuncert ] shows the relative theory uncertainty in the cross section . both the total uncertainty ( orange band ) and",
    "all its individual components are shown .",
    "the scale uncertainties ( right side hatches band ) are defined as the envelope of the independent two scales varying by a factor two up and down of the default choice .",
    "the effect of the uncertainty on the @xmath1 determination ( yellow band ) on the observable is estimated by calculating the cross section using strong coupling values within the uncertainty range and using pdf sets fitted using these values @xcite . the pdf uncertainty ( left side hatches band )",
    "is calculated using the uncertainties pdf sets as recommended by the authors @xcite .",
    "finally , the individual components are added in quadrature in the total uncertainty .",
    "one can see that both cteq6.6 and nnpdf2.0 give similar uncertainty for the cross section in the central and the forward region for jets with @xmath37 however , the use of nnpdf2.0 allows to shrink the total theory uncertainty to @xmath38% compared to cteq6.6 estimation of @xmath39% for high @xmath40 central rapidity jets . in the forward region",
    "the difference between the cteq6.6 and the nnpdf2.0 prediction for high @xmath40 jets is even more pronounced : up to @xmath41% for cteq6.6 compared to @xmath42% for nnpdf2.0 .",
