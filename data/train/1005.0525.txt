    "one of the directions of the nuclear spin physics at intermediate energies is the study of the two- and three - nucleon forces spin structure in the deuteron induced reactions .",
    "such investigations have been performed recently at rarf @xcite , rcnp @xcite , kvi @xcite and iucf @xcite .",
    "high accuracy polarization data have been obtained .",
    "the experiments have been proposed at the nuclotron @xcite and ribf @xcite to study the energy dependence of the three - nucleon forces spin structure via measuring the analyzing powers in @xmath0 elastic scattering .    however , these studies require the high precision polarimetry to obtain reliable values of beam polarization . on the one hand ,",
    "since deuteron is a spin-1 particle , the polarimetry should have a capability to determine simultaneously both vector and tensor components of the beam polarization .",
    "moreover , the effective analyzing powers of the polarimeter should be known with high precision to provide small systematic errors while determing the beam polarization components .",
    "the @xmath0 elastic scattering has been traditionally used for the tensor and vector polarimetry at intermediate and high energies .",
    "it was demonstrated that the @xmath0 elastic scattering at forward angles has large vector @xmath1 and tensor @xmath2 analyzing powers at 1600 mev @xcite and can be used for polarization analysis @xcite .",
    "shortcoming of the measurements at forward angles is that it requires a sophisticated equipment to identify the events .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , deuterons scattered at @xmath3 from a hydrogen target were selected by the two - arm magnetic spectrometer alpha , from the deuterons of other reaction channels and other particles .",
    "the same method has been applied recently at cosy using the anke spectrometer @xcite at the initial deuteron energy of 1170 mev and @xmath4 where the vector and tensor analyzing powers are large @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 elastic scattering at large angles ( @xmath5 ) has been successfully used for the deuteron polarimetry at riken at a few hundreds of mev .",
    "this reaction has several advantages as a beam - line polarimetry over the others .",
    "firstly , both the vector and tensor analyzing powers for the reaction have large values @xcite .",
    "the values of the analyzing powers were obtained for the polarized deuteron beam , whose absolute polarization had been calibrated via the @xmath6}$ ] reaction @xcite .",
    "the determination precision of the deuteron beam polarization values using this method is better than 2% . secondly , to indentify the events ,",
    "it is sufficient to carry out kinematical coincidence measurements of deuteron and proton by means of simple plastic scintillation counters . it is justified because of a small background event rate in comparison with the forward angles .",
    "the goal of the present article is to report about a new polarimeter based on the asymmetry measurements in @xmath0 elastic scattering at 270 mev at the internal target station ( its ) @xcite of the nuclotron ( lhep - jinr ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the details of the polarimeter construction are given in section [ polarimeter ] .",
    "the experimental and data analysis procedures are described in section [ experiment ] .",
    "the details of the beam polarization evaluation and results are given in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "the conclusions are drawn in the last section .",
    "the efficient polarimetry can be provided even for rather low beam intensity using a thin solid internal target inside the accelerator ring . due to a multi passage of the beam through the target point",
    ", the luminosity can be significantly increased by using the properly tuned internal target trajectory .",
    "therefore , this internal beam polarimeter with a very thin target can have approximately the same performance as the external beam polarimeters .",
    "the deuteron beam polarimeter was constructed at its in the nuclotron ring .",
    "its consists of a spherical scattering chamber and a target sweeping system where six different targets can be mounted . the 10  @xmath7 m  ch@xmath8 film was used as a proton target for the polarimeter .",
    "the details of its can be found in ref.@xcite .    a schematic view of the polarimeter is shown in fig.[fig : setup ] .",
    "a detector support with 43 mounted plastic scintillation counters is placed downstream the its .",
    "each plastic scintillation counter was coupled to a photo - multiplier tube hamamatsu h7416mod .",
    "eight proton detectors were used for left ( lp18 ) , as well as for right ( rp18 ) and up ( up18 ) , but due to space limitation  only four for down ( dp14 ) .",
    "the proton detectors were placed 630 mm from the target .",
    "the angular span of one proton detector was 2@xmath9 in the laboratory frame , which corresponds to @xmath104@xmath9 in the c.m .",
    "four deuteron detectors ( ld14 , rd14 , dd14 ) were placed at scattering angles of deuterons coinciding kinematicaly with the protons . on the other hand ,",
    "one deuteron detector ( ud1 ) can cover the solid angle corresponding to dp14 .",
    "the scattered deuterons and recoil protons were detected in kinematic coincidence over the c.m .",
    "angular range of 65135@xmath9 .",
    "in addition , one pair of detectors ( lpp and rpp ) was placed to register two protons from quasi - elastic @xmath11 scattering at @xmath12=90@xmath9 in the c.m . in the horizontal plane .",
    "the deuteron and quasi - elastic @xmath11 detectors were set in front of the proton detectors .",
    "sizes of the detectors and their setting angles for 270 mev are listed in table  [ tbl : detectors ] .",
    ".plastic scintillation counters used for the polarimeter .",
    "the setting angles of the detectors at 270 mev are shown in the last column .",
    "[ tbl : detectors ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the performance of the polarimeter is expressed in terms of the figure of merit , @xmath13 .",
    "it allows one to evaluate the counting rate @xmath14 , needed for the desired beam polarization accuracy @xmath15 : @xmath16    @xmath13 is a function of efficiency @xmath17 and analyzing power @xmath18 .",
    "it is defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the solid angle , and integration of ( [ fmerit ] ) is curried out over the angular domain of the polarimeter , efficiency @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the number of useful events detected and @xmath14 is the number of incident particles , @xmath18 is the analyzing power .    in our case",
    "the number of incident particles @xmath14 has been evaluated from the number of @xmath11 quasi - elastic events at 90@xmath9 in c.m . detected within the solid angle of @xmath23 sr .",
    "the estimation of figures of merit was done as a sum over all the scintillation counters for @xmath0 elastic events detection for the scattering angles of 75@xmath9 135@xmath9 in c.m .",
    "figures of merit @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 were estimated as @xmath101.6@xmath2710@xmath28 , @xmath102.1@xmath2710@xmath28 and @xmath100.6@xmath2710@xmath28 , respectively .",
    "these values are comparable with the figures of merit for the deuteron polarimeter used at the extracted beam at riken @xcite . however , in contrast with the riken polarimeter @xcite the large figures of merit values were obtained with a very thin ch@xmath8 target 10 @xmath7 m thick using the internal beam . estimated from @xmath11 quasi - elastic scattering at 90@xmath9 in c.m .",
    "the averaged luminosity was @xmath29 @xmath10 5.2@xmath27 10@xmath30 @xmath31 per beam spill .",
    "this value corresponds to the ch@xmath8 target effective length of @xmath32 5.2@xmath2710@xmath33 g/@xmath34 ( 0.6  mm ) for the external beam case .",
    "the performance of the polarimeter can be increased by the extention of the detection system to smaller scattering angles in c.m .",
    ", since in this region the cross section of @xmath0 elastic scattering is larger and the analyzing powers have non - zero values .",
    "the detection of @xmath0 elastic scattering at small angles in c.m . is especially important at higher energies since the cross section decreases while energy increasing .",
    "the current polarimeter can be used in a wide deuteron energy range .",
    "on the other hand , the current setup was used to measure analyzing powers in @xmath0 elastic scattering at higher energies @xcite to study three - nucleon correlations .",
    "the new polarimeter based on @xmath0 elastic scattering has been constructed at the internal beam of the nuclotron .",
    "the measurements of the deuteron beam polarization have been performed at 270 mev and at this energy there are already precise data on the @xmath0 elastic scattering analyzing powers in refs.@xcite .",
    "the detection at several scattering angles was used to compensate low intensity of the polarized beam from polaris @xcite .",
    "however , the systematic error due to the uncertainties in the values of the analyzing powers does not exceed 1 - 2% for the both vector and tensor beam polarizations .",
    "the figures of merit achieved are comparable with the ones for the external beam polarimeter at riken @xcite since the internal beam of the nuclotron performs multi passages through the thin ch@xmath8 target .",
    "this polarimeter can be used in a wide deuteron energy range @xcite .",
    "the future upgrade of the polarized ion source at the lhep - jinr accelerator complex @xcite will greatly enhance the capability of the current setup to measure spin - observables of the @xmath0 scattering and perform the polarimeter calibration in a wide energy range .",
