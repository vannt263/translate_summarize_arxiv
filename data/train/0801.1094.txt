    "the many - particle systems of the spatially - indirect excitons in coupled quantum wells ( cqws ) in the presence or absence of a magnetic field @xmath4 have been the subject of recent experimental investigations @xcite .",
    "these systems are of interest , in particular , in connection with the possibility of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) and superfluidity of indirect excitons or electron - hole pairs , which would manifest itself in the cqw as persistent electrical currents in each well and also through coherent optical properties and josephson phenomena.@xcite in high magnetic fields , two - dimensional ( 2d ) excitons survive in a substantially wider temperature range , as the exciton binding energies increase with magnetic field.@xcite the problem of essential interest is also collective properties of magnetoexcitons in high magnetic fields in superlattices and layered system.@xcite    in this paper we propose a new physical realization of magnetoexcitonic bec and superfluidity in in superlattices with alternating electronic and hole layers , that is in a sense representing array of cqws or graphene layers with spatially separated electrons ( @xmath5 ) and holes @xmath6 with spatially separated electrons and holes in high magnetic field .",
    "recent technological advances have allowed the production of graphene , which is a 2d honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms that form the basic planar structure in graphite @xcite graphene has been attracting a great deal of experimental and theoretical attention because of unusual properties in its band structure @xcite .",
    "it is a gapless semiconductor with massless electrons and holes which have been described as dirac - fermions @xcite .",
    "since there is no gap between the conduction and valence bands in graphene without magnetic field , the screening effects result in the absence of excitons in graphene in the absence of magnetic field .",

    "the gap reduces screening and leads to the formation of magnetoexcitons .",
    "we also consider magnetoexcitons in the superlattices with alternating electronic and hole graphene layers .",

    "if `` electron '' and `` hole '' quantum wells alternate , there are excitons with parallel dipole moments in one pair of wells , but dipole moments of excitons in another neighboring pairs of neighboring wells have opposite direction .",
    "this fact leads to essential distinction of properties of @xmath8 system in superlattices from ones for coupled quantum wells with spatially separated electrons and holes ( where indirect exciton system is stable due to dipole - dipole repelling of all excitons ) .",

    "<S> the density of superfluid component @xmath3 and the temperature of the kosterlitz - thouless phase transition to the superfluid state in the system of two - dimensional indirect magnetobiexcitons , interacting as electrical quadrupoles , are obtained for both qw and graphene realizations .    </S>",
