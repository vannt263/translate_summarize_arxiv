    "it has been found that for low values of the bjorken variable @xmath5 , @xmath9 , the total @xmath0 cross section , @xmath10 , extracted from lepton  hadron scattering presents the property of geometric scaling  @xcite .",
    "this property permits to write the cross section as a function of only one variable , @xmath11 , called the scaling variable , which is the product of two functions , one depending only on @xmath4 and the other only on @xmath5 .",
    "it has been suggested that , for @xmath1 , @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 with @xmath13 known as the saturation scale .",
    "geometric scaling has also been observed in @xmath14 reactions  @xcite , inclusive charm production  @xcite and nucleus  nucleus collisions  @xcite .",
    "the observation that @xmath1 grows quite rapidly at low @xmath5 and that this behavior can not continue indefinitely without violating the unitarity of the cross section led to the proposal of nonlinear qcd equations containing saturation  @xcite .",
    "one of the features of this type of equations is the introduction of a scale , @xmath15 , to signal the onset of saturation effects .",
    "much of the excitement and advance in the understanding of perturbative qcd at low @xmath5 in recent years comes from the discovery that some saturation equations imply geometric scaling at the saturation scale  @xcite .",
    "much recent theoretical work has been devoted to find both , the region where geometric scaling is valid and the functional form of the violations to geometric scaling above the saturation scale .",
    "studies based on the bfkl equation  @xcite supplemented with specific boundary conditions have found that there is a window of phase space above @xmath15 and below a @xmath16 on which geometric scaling is valid . for current accessible energies",
    ", @xmath16 is of the order of 100 gev@xmath8  @xcite .",
    "more recently , there have been indications that , in a more general nonlinear equation , geometric scaling is strongly violated  @xcite .    as the concept of geometric scaling",
    "has been linked to saturation , none of these investigations expect geometric scaling to be valid at large @xmath5 where the density of partons is very small .    here",
    "we study in detail the scaling properties of the total @xmath0 cross section and find that geometric scaling is related to the fact that at small @xmath5 , @xmath1 is very close to a homogeneous function , specifically a power law in both , @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "we show that it is possible to define a reduced cross section , called @xmath17 in the following , which isolates this power law behavior not only for the small , but also for the large @xmath5 region and thus shows geometric scaling in the complete kinematic plane .",
    "this document is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we show that it is possible to isolate the power law behavior in @xmath5 of @xmath1 for all values of @xmath4 and define the reduced cross section @xmath17 . in section [",
    "s : behavior ] we study the behavior of @xmath17 and show that it is very close to a generalized homogeneous function . in section [ s : discussion ] we discuss the implications of our findings regarding saturation and geometric scaling .",
    "we also present a compact parametrization of @xmath1 which describes all data above @xmath7 gev@xmath8 . finally , in section [ s : summary ] we briefly summarize our findings and present our conclusions .",
    "first , we turn to the behavior of @xmath1 at small @xmath5 .",
    "it is know , that the experimental data at small @xmath5 can be described at each value of @xmath4 by a power law in @xmath5  @xcite . from the point of view of theory ,",
    "this behavior is expected , for @xmath4 big enough to justify the use of pqcd , from both , the dlla approximation @xcite if the starting @xmath4 value for the qcd evolution is taken sufficiently small ( see for example @xcite ) , and from the bfkl @xcite evolution .    in fact , this behavior is also seen in studies of geometric scaling above the saturation scale .",
    "for concreteness we use the saturation scale @xmath21 , with @xmath22 , as defined by k. golec - biernat and m. wsthoff  @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite found that , for @xmath23 , @xmath24 suggesting a power law behavior of @xmath1 as a function of @xmath5 for constant values of @xmath4 .    in summary",
    ", it is expected from theory and phenomenology , and confirmed by experiment that , at small @xmath5 , @xmath1 behaves as a power law for fixed values of @xmath4 . following these results",
    ", we propose to write the total @xmath0 cross section at each @xmath4 value as the product of two functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 :    @xmath25    where    @xmath26    and we use @xmath27 instead of @xmath5bjorken  @xcite .",
    "both are related through    @xmath28    with @xmath29 = 140 mev .",
    "note that @xmath5 and @xmath27 are substantially different only at very low @xmath4 .",
    "note also that in equation ( [ eq_w ] ) both , the normalization , @xmath30 , and the exponent of the power law , @xmath31 , may be different , for different values of @xmath4 ; i.e. , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    as we are interested in isolating the scaling behavior of the cross section we require from @xmath3 to be approximately constant at small @xmath5 , so that it does not alter the physics embodied in @xmath2 , and that it describes the cross section at large @xmath5 .",
    "it turns out that these requirements are very closed to those expected from a valence distribution , so we tried the following functional form inspired in the work of @xcite :    @xmath34    where the gaussian represents the valence distribution of the proton and the error function takes care of enforcing the different kinematic constrains .",
    "we proceed now to test the _ ansatz _ embodied in equations ( [ eq_wv][eq_v ] ) .",
    "we use data from fixed target @xcite and hera @xcite experiments .",
    "we chose @xmath4 values such that there are measurements from both , fixed target and hera experiments , either at the same or at very similar @xmath4 .",
    "normally , these @xmath4 values are slightly different .",
    "we correct the fixed target data to the hera values using the h1 pdf 2000 fit @xcite . in most cases",
    "the correction factors are at the per mil level with a few cases at the one and two percent level .",
    "we then fit the data to the functional form of equation ( [ eq_wv ] ) for each @xmath4 value . as an example , figure [ fig1 ] shows data from hera and fixed target experiments at @xmath4=12 gev@xmath8 and @xmath4=120 gev@xmath8 along with the result of the fit .",
    "cross section is shown as a function of @xmath27 for @xmath4=12 gev@xmath8 and @xmath4=120 gev@xmath8 .",
    "the points are experimental data from fixed target and hera experiments and the line is a fit to the form of equations ( [ eq_wv][eq_v ] ) .",
    "a power law is clearly seen at low values of @xmath27 , while the structure at high @xmath27 corresponds to a gaussian  like distribution . ]    the data in figure [ fig1 ] is very well described by equation ( [ eq_wv ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the same can be said at each value of @xmath4 where there are measured points from both , fixed target and hera experiments . remarkably , we find that @xmath35 and @xmath36 from equation ( [ eq_v ] ) do not depend on @xmath4 .",
    "they take the values @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the fact that @xmath3 is independent of @xmath4 implies that all the qcd evolution in @xmath4 of the cross section is entirely contained in @xmath2 .",
    "thus , we define , in the complete kinematic plane , the reduced cross section @xmath17 as    @xmath39",
    "we turn now to study the reduced cross section . specifically , we study the dependence on @xmath4 of both @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we use all hera data  @xcite to fit @xmath17 for fixed values of @xmath4 .",
    "we do not use fixed target data at this stage of the analysis , because those data points are concentrated at high @xmath5 and thus , they do not have a lever arm long enough to determine accurately the power law parameters .",
    "their influence has already been taken into account through @xmath41 .",
    "we use 40 different experimental @xmath4 values , ranging from 0.15 to 8000 gev@xmath8 , with enough data points in @xmath5 to perform the fit .",
    "the average number of points for each fit was 8 , ranging from 5 to 12 . at each value of @xmath4 , equation ( [ eq_w ] )",
    "provides an excellent description of data .",
    "the results for @xmath30 and @xmath31 for each individual fit are quite precise and provide a clear picture of their @xmath4 dependence as shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "dependence of the normalization @xmath30 and the exponent @xmath31 of @xmath42 , extracted from fits of hera data to the reduced cross section @xmath17 at fixed values of @xmath4 .",
    "the solid lines are fits to equations ( [ eq_l ] ) and ( [ eq_n ] ) in the intermediate @xmath4 range given by the empty bullets in the figure . ]    we observe a dramatic change in the behavior of both functions , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , when the virtuality of the photon approaches from above the region below 1 gev@xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath31 is , as expected , very similar to the one found with the donnachie  landshoff parametrization @xcite ; while the normalization appears to saturate .",
    "furthermore , the value of @xmath30 and @xmath31 for the @xmath4 data below 1 gev@xmath8 are almost constant in comparison to the steep dependence of these functions above 1 gev@xmath8 .    above @xmath45 gev@xmath8",
    ", @xmath44 can be described with the following functional form    @xmath46    while @xmath43 behaves as the power law    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is taken as 1 gev@xmath8 .",
    "a fit in the intermediate @xmath4 region to the data plotted in figure [ fig3 ] yields @xmath49 @xmath50b , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 gev@xmath8 .",
    "the quality of the fits is @xmath54 and @xmath55 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively .",
    "note that the points at the largest @xmath4 were not taken into account , because they have big fluctuations due to the limited statistics of data .    in summary , for @xmath4 values below 1 gev@xmath8",
    "the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath2 is very soft and the function depends mainly on one variable : @xmath5 . above 1",
    "gev@xmath8 @xmath2 is very well described by the following functional form :    @xmath56",
    "* scaling . *",
    "the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath31 is only logarithmic .",
    "consider first the case where the exponent of @xmath5 is a constant @xmath57 .",
    "naming @xmath58 the function @xmath2 with @xmath59 , equation ( [ eq_wxq2 ] ) would be of the form    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is just the normalization and where we have reverted to @xmath5 instead of @xmath27 for simplicity , because both are equal in this kinematic domain .    in this case",
    "@xmath58 is a generalized homogeneous function , which , as can easily be demonstrated , implies that for all @xmath62 real and bigger than zero the following equation is valid :    @xmath63    in particular , it is also valid for @xmath64 : @xmath65 i.e. , @xmath58 exhibits _ exact _ scaling with the scaling variable given by @xmath66 .",
    "now , we turn to the real case where @xmath31 depends on @xmath4 . using",
    "the same @xmath64 one obtains    @xmath67    where    @xmath68    in this case the scaling is broken when @xmath69 , the exponent of @xmath5 in the rhs of equation ( [ eq_ngs ] ) is different from zero . with the help of figure [ fig3 ] ,",
    "note that for values of @xmath4 between 1 gev@xmath8 and the upper limit of @xmath4 used in @xcite , @xmath70 gev @xmath8 ( implicit for @xmath71 ) , the average value of @xmath44 is close to the value of @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath73 the exponent of @xmath5 in the rhs of equation ( [ eq_ngs ] ) takes its smallest values .",
    "furthermore , one can check that for any given @xmath4 in @xmath74 gev@xmath8 , the range covered in @xmath5 ( @xmath75 ) is limited in the current measured kinematic plane to an average of one order of magnitude .",
    "that means that for the given @xmath4 the departure from scaling for all @xmath5 points is similar and numerically small . as in the small @xmath5 region",
    "@xmath76 , this explains the approximated geometric scaling observed in  @xcite .",
    "this argument is valid in the complete kinematic plane because , as pointed out before , for @xmath4 below 1 gev@xmath8 , @xmath2 is already approximately a function of only one variable , namely @xmath5 , and the data shows a smooth matching of the two behaviors .",
    "thus , @xmath17 should display approximated geometric scaling for all values of @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig2 ] shows that this is indeed the case , while the right panel shows the scaling combination of equation ( [ eq_ngs ] ) .",
    "note that this latter case can not be considered properly as scaling and that it is shown for illustration purposes only .",
    "cross section , @xmath17 , as a function of the scaling variable @xmath77  @xcite for all data in  @xcite .",
    "the geometric scaling behavior is clearly seen for all values of @xmath11 .",
    "the right panel shows the scaling combination of equation ( [ eq_ngs ] ) .",
    "data points in the small @xmath5 region , @xmath71 are shown as full bullets to have a comparison with previous studies  @xcite . ]",
    "the data span some six orders of magnitude in @xmath5 , and another six in @xmath4 . with the addition of data with @xmath78 the geometric scaling behavior",
    "is extended two orders of magnitude in @xmath11 .",
    "it is quite interesting to compare figure  [ fig2 ] with figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the latter figure contains all data points above @xmath7 gev@xmath8 before the data collapse produced by the transformation to the scaling variable @xmath11 .",
    "the comparison of both figures shows that the collapse of all data in a single line is not a trivial fact .    * power laws , scaling and critical phenomena . *",
    "it has to be emphasized that the origin of scaling within this approach is the fact that @xmath2 is very close to a generalized homogeneous function .",
    "this fact is valid even at very large values of @xmath5 , where one would not necessarily expect saturation effects to be present .",
    "but it does not exclude the possibility that the mechanism which gives rise to the power law behavior of @xmath2 is also linked to saturation .    in this context",
    "it is interesting to note that scaling and its relation to power laws has been widely discussed in relation to critical phenomena .",
    "in particular it has been found that under some conditions the presence of a renormalization group equation helps to explain the appearance of power laws , of its associated scaling and permits also to explain and numerically estimate the appearance of scaling violations ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the power law behavior of the total @xmath0 cross section is generated by the branching process embodied in qcd evolution equations which are in fact a type of renormalization group equations . also",
    "the case of saturation has been cast , within the color glass condensate approach @xcite , in the form of renormalization group equations .",
    "it is clear then , that the subject of finding a deeper understanding of the relation between renormalization group equations and the emergence of power laws in pqcd deserves further studies .    * a parametrization of @xmath20 above @xmath79 gev@xmath80 . *",
    "note that as a consequence of the description of @xmath1 given by equation ( [ eq_wv ] ) we also have a simple six parameter description of the total @xmath81p cross section for _ all _ @xmath4 values above 1 gev@xmath8 :    @xmath82    p cross section , @xmath1 , is shown as a function of @xmath5 for different fixed values of @xmath4 going from @xmath83 gev@xmath8 to @xmath84 gev@xmath8 .",
    "the bullets are the experimental data points from hera , while the triangles are from fixed target experiments .",
    "the alternation of full and empty symbols is just to get a clear display of data .",
    "the lines are the result of equation ( [ eq_all ] ) . ]",
    "equation ( [ eq_all ] ) is compared to data in figure [ fig4 ] using the parameters obtained from the fit to figure [ fig2 ] . for these parameters",
    "the @xmath85 obtained for @xmath86 gev@xmath8 is @xmath87 .",
    "we have shown that @xmath1 can be separated as a product of a power law function , @xmath2 , carrying all the information on its @xmath4 evolution and a gaussian  like distribution , @xmath3 , which depends only on @xmath5 . as a consequence of this _ ansatz _",
    "we obtain a six parameter description of all @xmath1 data above @xmath45 gev@xmath8 , where each parameter has a natural physical interpretation .",
    "we define a reduced cross section , @xmath88 , and find that it is very close to a generalized homogeneous function over all the measured kinematic plane .",
    "this property is found to be responsible for the geometric scaling behavior of @xmath1 in the small @xmath5 region and of @xmath17 in the complete kinematic plane .",
    "these results show that the emergence of geometric scaling is not necessary related to saturation and open up interesting possibilities for further studies of the relation between evolution equations and the appearance of scaling behavior in qcd .",
