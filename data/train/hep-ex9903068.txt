    "one of the higgs production processes more likely to be observed is an associated production @xmath7 for @xmath8 gev / c@xmath1 , where v = w , z and @xmath9 . for the higgs mass above 130 gev / c@xmath1",

    "the ability to tag @xmath18 jets with high efficiency and a low mistag rate is vital for searching for the decay of @xmath9 .",
    "cdf uses the secondary vertex ( secvtx ) and soft - lepton ( slt ) @xmath18-tagging algorithms developed for the top quark discovery , while d0 uses a soft - muon @xmath18-tagging only .",
    "both cdf and d0 select the @xmath18-tagged @xmath19 2 jet events since it is expected to contain most of the signal , while @xmath18-tagged @xmath20 jet events are dominated by @xmath21 decays .    in a data sample of @xmath22 pb@xmath0 ,",
    "cdf observed 36 events with single svx @xmath18-tag and 6 events with two @xmath18-tagged jets ( svx - slt and svx - svx )  @xcite .",

    "several studies  @xcite in past have indicated that there is significant potential of observing associated production of higgs and @xmath32 boson with @xmath33 , because of large branching rations of @xmath34 .",
    "the signature of such decay is relative clean , a resonance of two @xmath18 tagged jets , plus either large missing @xmath35 ( @xmath36 gev ) or dilepton pair mass near the @xmath32 mass , which were triggered experimentally by either @xmath37 or leptons in the event .",

    "1998 , there was a joint cdf / d0/theory working group to study higgs searches at run - ii or beyond at the tevatron using more realistic cdf / d0 detector simulation for the signal and background estimation ( see http://fnth37.fnal.gov/higgs.html for more details ) . since the tevatron would be the only chance to discover the higgs before lhc , it would be important to establish the realistic higgs discovery potential beyond lep-2 .",
    "great progress has been made in terms of extending the depth and breadth of previous studies on the higgs reach  @xcite .",
    "there is no single , golden discovery channel at the tevatron .",
    "combining all the channels and data from both experiment data is crucial .",
    "the preliminary results indicate that the tevatron should be able to exclude the higgs mass up to 130 gev / c@xmath1 at the 95% c.l . with 2 fb@xmath0 data , or have a 5 @xmath5 discovery of the higgs mass up to 130 gev / c@xmath1 with 30 fb@xmath0 data  @xcite .",
    "a precise measurement of the top quark mass is an important ingredient in testing the consistency of the standard model with experimental data . in addition ,",
    "precise @xmath44 and top mass measurements can provide information on the mass of the higgs boson , which is a remnant of the mechanism that gives rise to spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking .    within the framework of the standard model the top quark decays almost exclusively into a real w boson and a b quark .",
    "the observed event topology is then determined by the decay modes of the two @xmath44 bosons , which can be classified into three decay channels .",
    "the dilepton channel has about 5% of the cases , with both @xmath44 bosons decay to @xmath45 or @xmath15 .",
    "the lepton + jets channel has 30% of the cases , one @xmath44 boson decays to @xmath45 or @xmath15 , and the other to a @xmath46 pair .",

    "the two experiments taking slightly different approaches in defining their events samples , with cdf taking advantage of their silicon vertex detector ( svx ) and d0 making greater use of kinematic variables to reduce backgrounds . the present sample of top candidates are consistent with standard model decays .",
    "one of cdf and d0 physics goals in run1 is to determine the top mass as accurately as possible using many different channels and techniques . as a result ,",
    "the uncertainty on the top quark mass has improved from @xmath48 gev / c@xmath1@xcite , first published in 1994 to the present @xmath49 gev / c@xmath1 .",
    "the advantage of measuring a top quark mass in the lepton + jets channel is its relatively larger branching ratio and the ability to full reconstruct the top mass on an event - to - event basis .",
    "both cdf and d0 select events containing a high @xmath39 ( @xmath16 ) single isolated electron ( muon ) in the central region , large missing transverse energy and at least four jets .",
    "measurement of the top quark mass begins by fitting each event in the sample to the hypotheses of @xmath21 production followed by decay in the lepton + jets channel ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "there are twelve distinct ways of assigning the four leading jets to the four partons @xmath18 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "in addition , there is a quadratic ambiguity in the determination of the longitudinal component of the neutrino momentum .",
    "this yields up to twenty - four different configurations for reconstructing an event according to the @xmath21 hypothesis with no @xmath18-tag , 12 configurations for events with a single @xmath18-tag , and 4 configurations for events with double @xmath18-tags .",
    "both cdf and d0 choose the jet configuration with the lowest @xmath54 .",
    "the precision of the top quark mass measurement is expected to increase with the number of observed events , the signal - over - background ratio , and the narrowness of the reconstructed - mass distribution . in cdf lepton",
    "+ jets mass analysis  @xcite , monte carlo studies show that an optimum way to partition the sample consists of subdividing the events into the four statistically independent subsamples : svx single @xmath18-tag , svx double @xmath18-tag , slt @xmath18-tag and untagged events .",
    "the reconstructed - mass distributions of the four subsample is plotted in figure  [ cdflj ] , from which cdf measures @xmath55 gev / c@xmath1 .",
    "the d0 lepton + jets mass analysis uses four kinematic variables weakly correlated with top mass to separate the top signal from the background processes  @xcite .",
    "they were combined into two different multivariate discriminant : a weighted likelihood that minimizes correlation with the reconstructed mass ( lb or  low bias \" ) and a neural network output ( nn ) .",
    "the data are binned according to the discriminant value to create top - rich and background - rich sub - samples .",
    "the subsamples are simultaneously fit to obtain the top quark mass @xmath56 gev / c@xmath1 , shown in figure  [ cdflj ] .",
    "2.5 truein 1.0 cm 2.5 truein      cdf recently reported an improved measurement of the top quark mass using dilepton events  @xcite originating predominantly from @xmath57 , where @xmath58 or @xmath59 .",
    "this measurement supersedes their previously reported result in the dilepton channel  @xcite , which was obtained by comparing data with monte carlo simulation of @xmath21 events for two kinematic variables , the @xmath18-jet energies and the invariant masses of the lepton and @xmath18-jet systems .",
    "since the dilepton system is under - constrained due to the two missing neutrinos in the final state , the cdf and d0 dilepton mass analyses  @xcite proceed by hypothesizing a top mass ( @xmath60 ) and solving event kinematics up to four - fold ambiguity for each of the two lepton - jet parings .",
    "two different weighting techniques have been developed .",
    "* neutrino weighting technique assigns a weight to each solution by comparing the predicted and measured missing transverse energy ( cdf and d0 )  @xcite . *",
    "matrix element weighting technique assigns a weight to each solution by the parton distribution functions and the matrix element for @xmath44 boson decay ( d0 )  @xcite .    for both weighting methods ,",
    "the weights are summed over each lepton - jet paring , and over the detector resolution for jets and leptons by sampling ( @xmath61 fluctuating ) the measured quantities many times according to their detector resolutions .",
    "the resulting weight functions for each cdf and d0 dilepton events , normalized to unity , are shown in figure  [ dilw ] .",
    "truein 1.0 cm 2 .",
    "-.2 cm    cdf assign each event a mass by averaging the two mass values corresponding to the weight closest to and greater than the half maximum weight on either side .",
    "figure  [ cdfdilm ] shows the distribution of these masses , together with the monte carlo expectation for background and fitted top , from which cdf determines a top quark mass value of @xmath62 gev / c@xmath1 .",
    "2.0 truein 1.0 cm 2.0 truein    -.2",
    "cm    d0 accounts for the shape of the weight function by integrating the weights in five equally spaced mass bins and forming a four - dimensional vector from the normalized weights .",
    "the top quark mass is extracted by comparing the distribution of observed events in this four - dimensional vector space with the predicted densities for top signal and background .",
    "the results of these fits give a top quark mass value of @xmath63 gev / c@xmath1 .      in this analysis  @xcite cdf",
    "selects @xmath21 events in which both @xmath44 bosons decay into quark - antiquark pairs , leading to an all hadronic final state .",
    "the study of this channel , with a branching ratio of about 4/9 , complements the leptonic modes , and the mass measurement takes advantage of fully reconstructed final state , but suffers a very large qcd multijet background . to reduce this background , events with at least one identified svx @xmath18-jet are required to pass strict kinematic criteria that favor @xmath21 production and decay .    the data sample consist of 136 events , of which @xmath64 events are expected to come from background .",
    "events are then reconstructed to the @xmath65 hypothesis , where both @xmath44 bosons decay into a quark pair , with each quark associated to one of the six highest @xmath39 jets .",
    "all the combinations are tried and the combination with lowest @xmath66 is chosen .",
    "the reconstructed 3-jet mass distribution is shown in figure  [ cdfdilm ] , from which cdf measures a top quark mass of @xmath67 gev / c@xmath1 .",
    "the overall systematic error has been revised from 12.0 to 5.7 gev / c@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the individual results from both cdf and d0 are combined according to a procedure developed by a joint cdf - d0 working group .",
    "the combined top mass from the tevatron is @xmath68 gev / c@xmath1 .",
    "the good agreement among the measurements is reflected by a @xmath54 probability of 75% of the mass average . combining the statistical and systematic errors in quadrature",
    ", we find @xmath69 gev / c@xmath1 , which gives the best measured quark mass ( @xmath70 ) .      in run - ii with 2 or more fb@xmath0 of integrated luminosity and the increased capabilities of the upgraded cdf and d0 detectors",
    ", we expect more than 1000 single tagged and about 600 double tagged @xmath21 events for each experiment .",
    "it will allow us to measure @xmath60 down to statistical error of 0.5 gev / c@xmath1 by scaling the present results .",
    "the dominant systematic errors are expected to be the uncertainties in modeling gluon radiation and the jet energy scale of the detectors , which hopefully can be reduced to 2 gev / c@xmath1 by studying @xmath71 in the double tagged @xmath21 events and 32k @xmath72 events from secondary vertex trigger .",
