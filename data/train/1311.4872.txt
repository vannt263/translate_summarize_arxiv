    "thus , it is physically justified to describe the driving field as a pulsed plane wave  @xcite .",
    "this approach has been used recently in connection to not only thomson and compton scattering  @xcite , but also to other strong - field processes such as bethe - heitler pair creation  @xcite , bremsstrahlung  @xcite , and mott scattering  @xcite .",

    "we observe additional structures of emitted radiation .",
    "we also demonstrate an appearance of a _ supercontinuum _ which arises from spectral broadening .",
    "it is commonly understood that the supercontinuum is a broad bandwidth radiation generated by an interaction of a narrow bandwidth laser beam with matter .",

    "we also show that the thomson - originated ( compton - originated ) supercontinuum allows one to produce _ zeptosecond _ ( possibly even _ yoctosecond _ ) pulses .    currently , the shortest optical pulses produced in a laboratory last for 67 attoseconds  @xcite .",

    "let us also remark that within such a pulse the electric field does not oscillate , as it is presented in fig .",
    "[ puls3axcbd20130907 ] .",
    "this means that the emitted radiation is generated practically in the form of a one - cycle pulse , or even well - separated two half - cycle pulses .",

    "an appearance of a broad bandwidth radiation ( spanning a few mev ) , which is sharply elongated around the propagation direction of the electron beam , has been demonstrated from nonlinear thomson ( compton ) scattering .",
    "our analysis of temporal distributions of the observed radiation shows that it can be used for a synthesis of zeptosecond ( likely even yoctosecond ) pulses . note that this is possible provided that the broad bandwidth radiation is coherent , which clearly proves that nonlinear thomson or compton scattering can lead to a generation of a supercontinuum .",
    "when analyzing properties of the formed zeptosecond pulses , we discovered that these are one - cycle ( half - cycle ) pulses .",
    "we have also seen that thomson ( compton ) radiation is very sensitive to a change of its emission direction . however , as we showed in this paper , the ultra - short pulses survive the space averaging . in light of this fact , we conclude that the thomson ( compton ) process can be used as a novel source of zeptosecond ( yoctosecond ) pulsed radiation .",

    "we note that the thomson process can be only considered as an approximation of the fundamental compton scattering , which describes the actual physical situation with the electron spin degrees of freedom included .",
