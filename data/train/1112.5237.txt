    "there are two liouville closures of @xmath6 ; in case  2 there is only one , but case  3 requires finer distinctions for a definite answer .",

    ". then the element @xmath210 is called a * gap * , and there are two ways to remove the gap : with @xmath217 , we have an @xmath2-field extension @xmath218 with @xmath219 and @xmath220 , and we also have an @xmath2-field extension @xmath221 with @xmath222 and @xmath223 .",

    "( any liouville closed extension of @xmath6 , however , contains either a copy of @xmath218 or a copy of @xmath221 . ) instead of `` @xmath6 falls under case  1 '' we say `` @xmath6 has a gap . ''",

    "an @xmath2-field falling under case  3 is said to admit * asymptotic integration*. this is because case  3 is equivalent to having for each non - zero @xmath16 in the field an element @xmath13 in the field such that @xmath224 .",
    "let @xmath6 be an asymptotic field .",
    "the ordered group @xmath225 equipped with the function @xmath226 is an * asymptotic couple * in the terminology of rosenlicht @xcite , who proved the first non - trivial facts about them as structures in their own right , independent of their origin in hardy fields .",

    "@xmath231 .",

    "the asymptotic couple of @xmath0 has a good model theory : it allows elimination of quantifiers in its natural language augmented by a predicate for the subset @xmath211 of @xmath10 , and its theory is axiomatized by adding to rosenlicht s axioms equipped with a valuation @xmath234 such that @xmath235 for all @xmath236 . ] for asymptotic couples the following requirements :    1 .",

    "@xmath211 is downward closed , @xmath237 , and @xmath211 has no maximum ; 4 .   there is no gap .",
    "this result is in @xcite , which proves also the weak o - minimality of the asymptotic couple of @xmath0 .",
    "we do not want to create the impression that the structure induced by @xmath0 on its value group @xmath10 is just that of an asymptotic couple : @xmath10 is also a vector space over the constant field @xmath1 : @xmath238 for @xmath239 and @xmath240 whenever @xmath241 and @xmath242 , @xmath243 .",
    "this vector space structure is also accounted for in @xcite .",
    "moreover , these facts about @xmath0 hold for any liouville closed @xmath2-field @xmath6 with small derivation ( with @xmath1 replaced by @xmath162 ) .",
    "the above material raises some issues which turn out to be related .",
    "first , no @xmath2-subfield @xmath6 of @xmath0 with @xmath244 has a gap . even to construct a _ hardy field _ with a gap and",
    "@xmath244 takes effort .",
    "nevertheless , the model theory of asymptotic couples strongly suggests that @xmath2-fields with a gap should play a key role , and so the question arises how a given @xmath2-field can be extended to one with a gap .",
    "the analogous issue for asymptotic couples is easy , but we only managed to show rather recently that every @xmath2-field can be extended to one with a gap .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in section  [ sec : important pc - sequence ] .",
    "recall : a valued field is _ maximal _ if it has no proper immediate extension ; this is equivalent to the more geometric notion of _ spherically complete_. for example , hahn fields are maximal .",
    "decisive results in the model theory of maximal valued fields are due to ax  &  kochen  @xcite and erov  @xcite . among other things they showed that _",
    "henselian _ is the exact first - order counterpart of _ maximal _ , at least in equicharacteristic zero . in later extensions",
    "( scanlon s valued differential fields in  @xcite and the valued difference fields from  @xcite ) , the natural models are still maximal . here and below ,",
    "`` maximal '' means `` maximal as a valued field '' even if the valued field in question has further structure like a derivation .    however , in our situation the expected natural models can not be maximal : no maximal @xmath2-field can be liouville closed , let alone existentially closed .",
    "maximal @xmath2-fields do nevertheless exist in abundance , and turn out to be a natural source for creating @xmath2-fields with a gap .",
    "it also remains true that immediate extensions require close attention : @xmath0 has proper immediate @xmath2-field extensions that embed over @xmath0 into an elementary extension of @xmath0 ; see the proof of proposition  [ nqel ] .",
    "thus we can not bypass the immediate extensions of @xmath0 in any model - theoretic account of @xmath0 as we are aiming for .",
    "[ thimmax ] every real closed @xmath2-field has an immediate maximal @xmath2-field extension .",
    "this was not even known when the value group is @xmath18 .",
    "a difference with the situation for valued fields of equicharacteristic @xmath245 ( without derivation ) is the lack of uniqueness of the maximal immediate extension .",
    "( the proof of proposition  [ nqel ] shows such non - uniqueness in the case of @xmath0 . )    here are some comments on our proof of theorem  [ thimmax ] .",
    "first , this involves a change of derivation as follows .",
    "let @xmath6 be a differential field with derivation  @xmath109 , and let @xmath246 .",
    "then we define @xmath247 to be the differential field obtained from  @xmath6 by taking @xmath248 as its derivation instead of @xmath109 .",
    "then the constant field  @xmath162 of @xmath6 is also the constant field of @xmath249 , and so @xmath250 is a common differential subring of @xmath251 and @xmath252 .",
    "given a differential polynomial @xmath253 we let @xmath254 be the result of rewriting @xmath41 in terms of the derivation @xmath248 , so @xmath255 for all @xmath188 .",
    "( for example , @xmath256 in @xmath252 . ) this change of derivation is called * compositional conjugation*. a suitable choice of @xmath257 can often drastically simplify things .",
    "also , if @xmath6 is an @xmath2-field and @xmath258 , then @xmath249 is still an @xmath2-field , with @xmath259 .",
    "next , given any valued differential field @xmath6 , we extend its valuation @xmath160 to a valuation on the domain @xmath251 of differential polynomials by @xmath260 let now @xmath6 be a real closed @xmath2-field with value group @xmath244 , and suppose first that @xmath6 does not admit asymptotic integration",
    ". then @xmath212 exists in @xmath10 , and by compositional conjugation we can arrange that @xmath261 .",
    "one can show that then @xmath6 is * flexible * , by which we mean that it has the following property : for any @xmath253 with @xmath262 and any @xmath263 , the set @xmath264 is infinite .",
    "this property then plays a key role in constructing an immediate maximal @xmath2-field extension of @xmath6 .",
    "( it is worth mentioning that the notion of flexibility makes sense for any valued differential field .",
    "there are indeed other kinds of flexible valued differential fields such as those considered in @xcite where this property can be used for similar ends . )",
    "the case that the real closed @xmath2-field @xmath6 does admit asymptotic integration is harder and uses compositional conjugation in a more delicate way .",
