    "models of quantum rotors or the ising model in a transverse field on a @xmath0-dimensional lattice are among the simplest systems which exhibit a zero temperature ( @xmath2 ) quantum transition  @xcite .",
    "this is particularly true in the absence of quenched disorder : then the critical properties map directly onto those of the corresponding classical spin model in @xmath3 dimensions , with the quantum time behaving just like another spatial dimension .",
    "however , in the presence of quenched disorder , the situation is more complicated .",
    "the disorder has no dynamic fluctuations , so the corresponding classical spin models have randomness which is constant along the ` time ' direction ; unfortunately , there is only a rather limited existing body of knowledge on such classical systems that one can draw on .",
    "nevertheless , these models still constitute an attractive setting for the study of the complicated interplay of quenched disorder , interactions and quantum mechanics .",
    "one can quite reasonably hope that the insight obtained from their analysis might prove profitable in other systems which involve the same ingredients  these include the metal - insulator and superfluid - insulator transitions and have been the focus of a large number of experimental investigations .",
    "direct experimental studies of the models studied in this paper have been much more limited , although a recent investigation of a system which can be well described by the ising model in a transverse field is noteworthy  @xcite .",
    "three component quantum rotors with quenched disorder may also be a reasonable starting point for understanding some of the spin - fluctuation properties of the doped cuprate compounds in a regime with localized holes  @xcite .",
    "we consider the following hamiltonian of quantum rotors on the site @xmath4 of a regular , @xmath0-dimensional lattice : @xmath5 where the sum @xmath6 is over nearest neighbors , although our results should also apply to models with more general short - range interactions .",
    "the @xmath7-component vectors @xmath8 , with @xmath9 , are of unit length , @xmath10 , and represent the orientation of the rotors on the surface of a sphere in @xmath7-dimensional rotor space .",
    "the operators @xmath11 ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) are the @xmath15 components of the angular momentum @xmath16 of the rotor : the first term in @xmath17 is the kinetic energy of the rotor with @xmath18 the moment of inertia .",
    "the different components of @xmath19 constitute a complete set of commuting observables and the state of the system can be described by a wavefunction @xmath20 .",
    "the action of @xmath16 on @xmath21 is given by the usual differential form of the angular momentum @xmath22 the commutation relations among the @xmath16 and @xmath8 can now be easily deduced .",
    "we emphasize the difference of the rotors from heisenberg - dirac quantum spins : the components of the latter at the same site do not commute , whereas the components of the @xmath8 do .",
    "let us also introduce the hamiltonian of the ising model in a transverse field , @xmath23 : @xmath24 here @xmath25 are the @xmath26 components of the three pauli spin operators , with the pauli operators on different sites commuting with each other .",
    "each site , therefore , has an ising degree of freedom , represented by the eigenvalues of the @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath28 is the kinetic energy term and induces on - site flips of the ising spins .",
    "the analogy between @xmath17 and @xmath23 should be quite clear .",
    "@xmath17 has a global @xmath29 symmetry , while @xmath23 has a global , @xmath30 , spin - flip symmetry associated with the unitary transformation @xmath31 . in both models ,",
    "the interaction terms proportional to the @xmath32 would , if @xmath33 were zero , prefer a ground state in which each rotor or ising spin has a definite orientation which minimizes the exchange energy , and quantum fluctuations are absent : any such choice will break the global @xmath29 or @xmath30 symmetry in a given sample ( although the spin - glass phase preserves a statistical spin symmetry after averaging , discussed in sec  [ spinglassphase ] )",
    ". a small @xmath33 will not necessarily destroy this phase , in sufficiently high spatial dimension . in the opposite limit @xmath34 ,",
    "both @xmath17 and @xmath23 possess non - degenerate ground states which preserve the global symmetry .",
    "for the rotors , each site is in the spherically symmetric ` @xmath35-wave ' state ( using the language of @xmath36 ) .",
    "similarly , each ising spin is in the eigenstate of @xmath37 with eigenvalue @xmath38 : @xmath39 which is @xmath30 invariant . in both cases ,",
    "the @xmath40 ground state is separated from the first excited state by a gap of order @xmath33 .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to consider the @xmath32 s as perturbations in this limit ( though the random nature of the @xmath32 causes some problems which we will discuss later ) and to expect that this `` quantum - disordered '' phase persists at finite values of @xmath32 .",
    "thus we expect both ordered and disordered phases to exist at zero temperature .",
    "the above discussion should make it clear that it is natural to consider the transverse - field ising model as simply the @xmath41 case of the quantum rotors .",
    "as in the classical and non - random quantum cases , the main difference between @xmath41 and @xmath42 is that the latter has a continuous symmetry and possesses gapless spin - wave excitations in magnetically ordered phases .",
    "for ease of the subsequent discussion , it is convenient to introduce a notation which allows simultaneous discussion of the rotor and ising models .",
    "we therefore introduce an @xmath7-component spin @xmath43 , with @xmath44 , such that @xmath45 we will use the general @xmath43 notation in most of the remainder of the paper .",
    "it is also possible to modify @xmath17 and @xmath23 by allowing @xmath33 to have random fluctuations about its mean value .",
    "this does not affect the analysis of the phases of the model .",
    "it does represent an important type of randomness that will be considered in our discussion of the landau theory .",
    "we have now introduced three energy scales , @xmath33 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and the nature of the ground state becomes especially clear when one of the three scales is much larger than the other two .",
    "the three phases so obtained are the ferromagnet ( @xmath52 ) , the spin - glass ( @xmath53 ) , and the quantum paramagnet ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "we review the structure of the three phases in turn ( analogous to finite temperature phases in classical models ) :    [ [ ferromagnet ] ] ferromagnet : + + + + + + + + + + + +    each site acquires a static moment , and further the average of the moments on the different sites is non - zero : @xmath55 = m_{0\\mu } \\neq 0.\\ ] ] the ferromagnetic order parameter is @xmath56 ; note however that the first , quantum expectation value will have fluctuations from site to site about @xmath56 .",
    "the reader may be aware of mappings between the low - energy properties of clean quantum heisenberg spin models and quantum rotors  @xcite : we note here that it is the _ anti_ferromagnetically - ordered nel phase of heisenberg spin that maps onto the ferromagnetic phase of quantum rotors .

    "[ [ quantum - paramagnet ] ] quantum paramagnet : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    this phase has no static moment : @xmath65 it differs in one important respect from the strong - coupling , @xmath66 , picture discussed earlier .",
    "the gap in the excitation spectrum is filled in by contributions from rare regions in which the local values of @xmath32 are such as to place the system in one of the magnetically ordered phases .",
    "a brief discussion of such ` griffiths effects ' is presented in appendix  [ griffiths ] .",
    "there has been some earlier work on the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases and the transition between them . in one dimension , many exact properties have been determined for the transverse field ising model  @xcite . in @xmath67 , the @xmath41 spin - glass phase and its transitions are closely related to those of the ferromagnet , as the former can be related to the latter by a gauge transformation which makes all the @xmath32 positive .",
    "( the magnetically - ordered phases do not exist for @xmath9 in @xmath67 ) . in higher dimensions ,",
    "there has been a discussion of the field - theoretic properties of the ferromagnetic - paramagnetic transition  @xcite .",
    "boyanovsky and cardy  @xcite identified @xmath68 as the upper - critical dimension and discussed the scaling properties of the correlation functions .",
    "a study of the critical properties below @xmath68 in an expansion in @xmath69 yields a flow to strong - coupling with no stable , physical fixed point ( the only stable fixed - point has unphysical properties like a negative variance of some observables ) .",
    "however , boyanovsky and cardy  @xcite showed that a stable , physical , fixed point could be obtained in a theory with @xmath70 time dimensions , in a double expansion in @xmath71 and @xmath70 ; it is not known whether this fixed point continues to be pertinent all the way to @xmath72 .",
    "we will not make any further references to the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "it is convenient , therefore , to specialize henceforth to the case of @xmath32 distributions which are symmetric about @xmath66 and in particular have @xmath73 in this case , it can be shown  @xcite that the disordered - averaged correlation functions are in fact invariant under a @xmath30 gauge transformation @xmath74 , with @xmath75 and site - dependent .",
    "a zero temperature spin glass to quantum paramagnet phase transition will occur as the ratio @xmath76 is increased and is the subject of most of the following .",
    "the spin - glass phase and its transitions were studied in refs  @xcite , with considerable additional interest in the last year  @xcite .",
    "huse and miller  @xcite studied the transverse - field ising model with infinite - range interactions and determined exact critical properties of the transition separating the spin - glass and paramagnetic phases .",
    "we have studied  @xcite the quantum - rotor model with infinite - range interactions and obtained essentially identical results .",
    "the independence of the critical properties on the value of @xmath7 was also understood  @xcite .",
    "we now highlight features of these results which will be important for our discussion .      in the infinite - range version of @xmath17 ( [ hamrot ] ) , or @xmath77 ( [ hamising ] ) , the interactions @xmath32 are taken to be independent random variables with distribution @xmath78 for all pairs @xmath79 of distinct sites ; @xmath80 is the number of sites .",
    "note that the variance of @xmath81 in the infinite range model , but is @xmath82 in the finite range model . as @xmath83 mean - field theory becomes exact , which means that one only need solve a problem of a single site with a self - interaction between different times @xmath84 of @xmath85 , where @xmath86 has to be determined self - consistently as @xmath87 with the average being calculated with the same self - interaction @xmath86 .",
    "this was done by self - consistency arguments on the spectral density by miller and huse , and by taking the limit @xmath88 and then expanding in @xmath89 using similar arguments , by the present authors .",

    "the fourier transform @xmath100 of @xmath101 has the form @xmath102 for @xmath103 , which is responsible for the @xmath97 behavior at @xmath104 and it turns out that the correlation time @xmath105 diverges as @xmath106 thus we can define an exponent @xmath107 , anticipating anisotropic scaling in space and time in the short - range model , which takes the value @xmath108 in the infinite range model .",
    "the log correction originates from effects of the length constraint .",
    "its significance will be fully explained in our later analysis .",
    "since @xmath109 is the edwards - anderson order parameter , we may also define @xmath110 and it is found that @xmath111 . at @xmath96 one expects @xmath112",
    "@xcite which is satisfied with the values already obtained .",
    "it is perhaps surprising that the critical properties of the self - consistent single - site quantum problem can be obtained exactly for all @xmath7 , and it remains to explain some features of the results , such as the logarithmic violations of scaling .",
    "one of our goals in this paper is to provide a conceptually simpler derivation of the results based on a landau action functional and to explain the logarithms as due to the decay of a marginally irrelevant variable which we will identify .",
    "we also wish to calculate critical properties in short - range , finite - dimensional models , and to this end we will study mean - field theory and gaussian fluctuations around it in the landau theory framework .",
    "we will show that in this approximation , @xmath113 and @xmath114 . we will also define correlation functions in the next subsection and obtain their scaling properties in the same approximation later , obtaining @xmath115 by definition in mean - field theory . for sufficiently large @xmath0 ( @xmath116 ) and for a certain range of values of landau couplings , we will show that these mean field theory results are valid and have the same critical properties as in the infinite - range model ( where comparisons are possible , _",
    "i.e. _ not for correlations at large spatial separation and not for the non - linear susceptibility which has a singular infinite - range limit  @xcite ) .",
    "however outside this range , and for all couplings at @xmath117 , we find a renormalization group flow to a region where perturbation theory breaks down .",
    "in classical finite temperature transitions the equilibrium critical properties can be studied in terms of static fluctuations of some `` order - parameter '' field . for classical spin glasses in the replica formalism ,",

    "the definition ( [ defqea1 ] ) of the edwards - anderson order parameter now implies @xmath126 relating @xmath57 to the replica diagonal components of @xmath127 .",
    "( a reminder : the einstein summation convention on the vector index @xmath13 is being used in ( [ defd ] ) .",
    "however , no such convention is used for the @xmath128 replica indices ) .",
    "it is important to note here that the definition ( [ defqea2 ] ) also relates @xmath57 to the replica off - diagonal components of @xmath127  @xcite , whose expectation value will be time independent .",
    "we have introduced above double angular brackets to represent averages taken with the translationally invariant replica action ( recall that single angular brackets represent thermal / quantum averages for a fixed realization of randomness , and square brackets represent averages over randomness ) .",
    "we saw in the infinite range model that the behavior of @xmath86 at long times in mean field theory changed significantly at the transition and it is clear that the theory of fluctuations must include the whole matrix function @xmath127 , for _ both _ its diagonal and off - diagonal components .",
    "strictly speaking the replica diagonal @xmath127 at finite @xmath129 is not an order parameter because its expectation is non - zero on both sides of the transition ; nonetheless it does play the role of the `` order parameter field '' in the landau theory .    in the finite dimensional model , where @xmath32 couples nearest neighbors only , @xmath130 is expected to acquire a long time limit only at the transition to , and in , the spin glass phase .",
    "however its behavior in the paramagnetic phase may differ from that in mean field theory ( the infinite range model ) for the following reason .",
    "since the @xmath32 s are random , there is some chance of any given region having all @xmath32 s large in magnitude and thus resembling a patch of the ordered phase .",
    "such an event would be statistically rare , but can contribute significantly to the long time behavior of @xmath86 ( which is the average on - site correlation function ) because the finite region will have slow overturns of its instantaneous moment .",
    "the effects of these `` griffiths singularities '' on @xmath86 has been discussed recently by thill and huse  @xcite for @xmath41 ; the extension of their argument to @xmath42 is presented in appendix  [ griffiths ] ; for @xmath42 , we find only weak essential singularities at @xmath131 in the spectral function for @xmath86 .",
    "an important question is whether similar fluctuations affect the critical properties , an effect presumably not included in the treatment that will be given later .",
    "it is also helpful to introduce here a number of correlation functions of the order parameter whose scaling properties will be described in the paper .",

    "we begin by setting up the landau action functional for the finite dimensional models near the zero temperature phase transition , on which most of our results will be based . in section  [ meanfieldtheory ] , this functional is minimized to yield mean field theory , including for the first time external fields ; correlation functions are discussed at the gaussian level . in section  [ renormgroup ] ,",
    "a renormalization group method is used to examine the stability of the mean - field results to fluctuations , and to search for non - trivial exponents below the upper critical dimension @xmath155 ( no accessible perturbative fixed points are found in @xmath156 , however ) .",
    "section  [ scalinghypoth ] discusses general scaling theory and compares with results from numerical simulations .",
    "sketches of a derivation of the landau theory and of griffiths singularities appear in the appendices .",
    "in order to write down the landau theory for our model it will be useful to first review what is required in general of such a theory . the starting point of a landau theory is a landau ( or landau - ginzburg - wilson ) functional which as a first step describes the free energy of the system near its critical point as a functional of its order parameter , for example the magnetization @xmath157 of an ising - like ferromagnet near its classical finite temperature transition . in principle , the functional arises by considering the free energy in the presence of a field , say @xmath158 , that is thermodynamically conjugate to @xmath157 ( so that @xmath159 appears in the hamiltonian ) , finding the expectation of @xmath157 for each @xmath158 , and then writing the free energy as a functional of @xmath157 through a legendre transformation . in the present example this would be assumed to take the form @xmath160\\ ] ] where the dots denote terms with higher powers of @xmath157 and/or more derivatives .",

    "note that @xmath162 appears linearly .",
    "then for @xmath163 , @xmath164 and for @xmath165 , @xmath166 , and the usual critical behavior of landau theory can be obtained .",
    "the key assumptions of landau s approach are that , since @xmath157 is zero on the disordered ( paramagnetic ) side , then we can consider @xmath157 small and expand in powers , and the lowest powers will dominate near the critical point ( odd powers are dropped by symmetry in this particular example ) .",
    "similarly dependence of the coefficients on @xmath167 is analytic and all except the leading one @xmath168 can be dropped . in considering position",
    "dependent fluctuations , @xmath169 can be used as the action in a functional integral over @xmath157 , and the interactions of @xmath157 at different positions are represented by the expansion in powers of gradients , corresponding to the short range interactions in the original physical problem .    turning to the quantum spin glasses discussed in section  [ introduction ] , we notice as mentioned there that the `` order parameter '' @xmath170 is found in mean field theory to be a _ function _",
    "@xmath171 , independent of @xmath125 , which is non - zero for all finite @xmath172 even in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "we therefore can not expand in powers of @xmath127 as @xmath127 is typically not small .",
    "if instead we attempt to expand in powers of @xmath173 , it turns out that the action obtained contains very nonanalytic frequency dependence near @xmath96 and so is unsatisfactory according to the criteria above .",
    "the solution is found by examining the fourier transform @xmath174 of @xmath175 , eqn ( [ defd ] ) .",
    "@xmath130 is a positive function that decreases monotonically with @xmath176 , and its fourier transform has similar properties in @xmath177 . the constant in eqn ( [ valdinf ] ) is thus of order 1 , and in fact can contain dependence on @xmath178 and on @xmath177 , but these are analytic and negligible compared with the more singular dependence contained in @xmath179 . the latter part is nonanalytic in both @xmath177 and @xmath180 as @xmath181 and @xmath182 , but it _ is _ small in this region , and it is this part in which we wish to expand the free action .",
    "that is , we expand in @xmath183 where the constant is chosen so that @xmath184 is zero ( only ) at @xmath185 and @xmath96 .",
    "the nonanalytic behavior of @xmath186 away from this point should emerge from minimizing the action that should be analytic in form in both frequency ( or @xmath93 derivatives ) and @xmath178 .",
    "the @xmath187 corrections to power - law scaling should also emerge in this way .",
    "in appendix  [ derivation ] we sketch a direct derivation of the action functional in a microscopic model . here",
    "we will proceed by the alternative procedure of writing down all terms allowed by the above considerations , together with simple symmetry requirements .",
    "we use the same notation @xmath188 for the new , shifted field . as it differs only by a @xmath189 from the original field , which has little effect on the scaling of critical correlations , we can usually ignore the change in definition .    explicitly , the terms allowed in the action must satisfy :    1 .   the action is an integral over space of a local operator which can be expanded in gradients of powers of @xmath127 evaluated at the same position @xmath125 .",
    "@xmath127 is bilocal ( _ i.e. _  is a matrix ) in time , and each time is associated with one of the two replica indices and with one of the two @xmath29 vector indices ( see definition eqn ( [ composite ] ) ) .",
    "all these `` indices '' can appear more than once in a term and are summed over freely subject to the following rules before summations : 1 .",
    "each distinct replica index appears an even number of times  @xcite .",
    "@xmath29 vector indices appear twice each , and only when the corresponding replica indices are the same , due to the @xmath29 symmetry of the randomness .",
    "3 .   repetition of a time `` index '' corresponds to interaction of spins , which must be local in time and accordingly can be expanded as terms with times set equal plus the same with additional derivatives ; it occurs when the corresponding replica indices are the same , and only then .",
    "the action should be invariant under space and time translations , and under space and time inversions ( under which @xmath127 is invariant ) .",
    "( the rules for the indices may be best appreciated diagrammatically or from the microscopic approach in appendix  [ derivation ] . )",
    "the possibility of eliminating a quadratic term by such a shift in the field variable arises generally in field theories containing a cubic term .",
    "the simplest example is for a theory with a single scalar field @xmath157 , which arises physically in the yang - lee  @xcite edge of a classical ising - like ferromagnet in an imaginary magnetic field .",
    "the field induces an imaginary expectation of @xmath157 , which when eliminated by redefining @xmath157 by a shift , generates , due to the real @xmath202 coupling in the ising system , an imaginary @xmath203 term in the new @xmath157 . in the landau theory of this critical point , due to m.e .",
    "fisher  @xcite , it is again convenient to shift away the quadratic term and leave a linear term in @xmath157 in the action .",
    "the coefficient , @xmath199 , of this term controls the distance from the critical point , where power law correlations of @xmath157 appear .",
    "since @xmath199 appears in the same form as an ( additional ) external field , there is only a single scaling field ( @xmath157 ) in the critical theory  @xcite , and there is a scaling relation between the exponent @xmath204 governing correlations of @xmath157 at the critical point , and the correlation length exponent @xmath205 . in our spin glass model , one might similarly expect an exponent relation , since the operator @xmath206 is the `` thermal '' operator whose coefficient in @xmath191 drives one across the transition , while @xmath207 is the basic order parameter field . however due to the `` trace '' over replica , @xmath208 vector , and imaginary time indices in the thermal operator , it is far from clear that these two will in fact have the same scaling dimension in general .",
    "we will address this point further in section  [ scalinghypoth ] .",
    "however at mean field level , _",

    "the scaling dimension of the @xmath330 perturbation is @xmath581 ; knowing this and the scaling dimensions above , the mean - field critical properties of the replica - symmetry breaking effects can be given a standard scaling interpretation .",
    "the flows are shown in fig  [ rgflowdeq8 ] .",
    "the only stable fixed point remains @xmath552 and its basin of attraction is the region @xmath582 .",
    "now the flow of @xmath192 into this fixed point is also marginal ( in addition to @xmath542 ) and so there will be new logarithmic corrections to scaling . as before , we know little about the system outside the basin of @xmath552 .",
    "now @xmath552 is the only fixed point with @xmath192 real , but is unstable .",
    "the flows are shown in fig  [ rgflowdlt8 ] .",
    "thus over the entire , physical region we have flows to strong coupling .",
    "there is no simple expansion of the critical properties in powers of @xmath545 .",
    "no definite results can thus be obtained , and we resort to some speculations using phenomenological scaling ideas in the next section .",
    "in this section we discuss the scaling properties that may be expected at the transition in our models ; as far as possible this will be done without reference to the landau theory or to replicas .",
    "we begin by collecting the definitions of exponents and the scaling hypotheses that have been mentioned at various points earlier in the paper .    because of the importance of the dangerously irrelevant ( di ) variable @xmath193 in the landau theory and to gain greater generality",
    ", we will assume that such a variable , also denoted @xmath193 with scaling dimension @xmath583 , exists in the scaling theory .",
    "we assume that there is only this one di variable ; the coupling @xmath192 that is also di in landau theory for @xmath584 , will not be for @xmath585 , as in ordinary critical phenomena .",
    "the extension to include more di variables is straightforward , and of course if none are present , one can simply set @xmath586 .",
    "moreover , it will be assumed that @xmath193 appears in a similar way as in the landau theory , which contains a @xmath198 term as well as @xmath517 terms .",
    "this means that in each realization of disorder , @xmath193 plays a role similar to @xmath587 in quantum field theory ( or @xmath2 in classical statistical mechanics ) : when it is small , certain types of disorder - induced fluctuations ( those directly responsible for determining the local position of the critical point ) dominate .",
    "( the analogy is not exact because of the internal frequency integrals that can occur even in tree diagrams in @xmath127 within landau theory . ) due to quenched disorder defining @xmath142 as in ( [ defgd1 ] ) , we can then define the exponent @xmath284 by @xmath588 for fixed @xmath589 at criticality ; there is no dependence on @xmath193 on the right hand side .",
    "thus the dimension of @xmath590 when the spins are separated in time is @xmath591 .",
    "therefore also ( recall ( [ defd ] ) ) @xmath592 the spin glass correlator , @xmath138 , ( recall ( [ defgd2 ] ) ) vanishes if @xmath509 , so is proportional to @xmath193 ( as @xmath593 ) and thus behaves as @xmath594 comparing with the definition of @xmath204 , @xmath595 yields @xmath596 from these we may obtain other scaling relations , _",
    "e.g. _  the spin - glass susceptibility @xmath597 with @xmath598 and the order parameter @xmath599 \\sim ( r_c - r)^{\\beta}$ ] with @xmath600 in general , the usual scaling relations are obeyed , except that hyperscaling involves @xmath601 in place of @xmath0 for classical critical phenomena whenever the bilocal field is involved ( hence the @xmath602 ) and the @xmath513 is due to the di variable @xmath193 . on the other hand ,",
    "a field that is local in time behaves normally ( on including @xmath506 and @xmath513 ) .",
    "thus the free energy density scales as @xmath603 as @xmath604 , and the specific heat at finite temperature @xmath288 at @xmath241 behaves as @xmath605 ; the values @xmath113 , @xmath606 yield @xmath607 at @xmath608 in the gaussian theory , as was obtained directly in the infinite - range model  @xcite and from the mean field theory in ( [ freeent ] ) .",
    "the response of the system to an external field coupling to the conserved angular momentum scales as @xmath609  @xcite in the quantum - critical region ii of fig  [ phasediag]at @xmath1 this is @xmath610 , in agreement with ( [ freeenh ] ) .    a local variable , which has not been introduced so far , but is important for the present scaling considerations , is the `` thermal '' operator @xmath611 .",
    "this variable couples to the control parameter @xmath199 that tunes the system across the quantum transition : @xmath612 in a single replica of the system . for the disconnected correlator of @xmath613",

    "the connected correlation function then goes as @xmath619 and so @xmath620 - \\left[\\left\\langle \\psi ( x , 0 ) \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle \\psi ( 0 , 0 ) \\right\\rangle \\right ] & \\sim & x^{-(d-4+\\theta+\\bar{\\eta}_{\\psi } ) } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\equiv & x^{-(d+z-2 + \\eta_{\\psi})}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( from @xmath621 in fourier space ) and hence @xmath622 as usual the dimension of @xmath613 determines that of @xmath249 , and hence the value of @xmath205 , through modified hyperscaling , that is @xmath623    an interesting rigorous inequality was proved by schwartz and soffer  @xcite for the exponents @xmath624 , @xmath625 in any system where a local field @xmath613 couples to gaussian disorder , as is the case for our @xmath613 . extending their proof to the case where the disorder is time independent , we obtain @xmath626 and hence from ( [ thetapsi ] ) @xmath627 . using ( [ nupsi ] )",
    "this implies @xmath628 this inequality was proved by chayes",
    "the present approach appears easier but rests upon the use of a scaling relation to obtain @xmath205 .    for the classical random field ising model",
    ", it has been claimed that @xmath629 is satisfied as an equality  @xcite .",
    "this would imply that the correlation length at @xmath630 due to a uniform field @xmath385 would go as @xmath631 .",
    "however we find the proof unconvincing , though series results do seem to show that the equality is accurately obeyed in @xmath632 in that problem .",
    "since @xmath633 it is tempting to equate the scaling dimensions of @xmath127 and @xmath613 ( @xmath634 ) and obtain using ( [ thetaeta ] ) and ( [ thetapsi ] ) @xmath635 however @xmath613 involves bringing spins @xmath265 to the same time as well as position ( and summing over spin indices ) and so may have different renormalizations than @xmath127 .",
    "thus we do _ not _ expect this relationship to hold",
    ".    finally , let us consider the connected correlation function , @xmath144 , defined in ( eqn ( [ defgc ] ) ) .",
    "similar scaling ideas suggest the following form at criticality ( taking the @xmath41 case for simplicity ) @xmath636 with @xmath637 a universal function . taking either of the limits @xmath638 , or @xmath639 has the consequence of bringing 2 of the 4 @xmath265 fields in @xmath144 to the same spacetime point , so that @xmath144 reduces to a correlator of @xmath613 . knowing the scaling dimension of @xmath613 , this procedure fixes the asymptotic limits of @xmath640 : @xmath641 similar statements hold for the general @xmath642 , and for @xmath142 with a different scaling function @xmath643 .",

    "note that the negative value of @xmath204 is quite reasonable in a disordered system  @xcite .",
    "the numerical results so far give no test of hyperscaling , but guo _ et .",
    "@xcite also studied @xmath86 , obtaining @xmath656 . using the scaling relations and values of exponents in @xmath645 we obtain @xmath657 .",
    "this may mean that conventional hyperscaling is obeyed , though because of uncertainties in exponents , a small positive @xmath513 can not be ruled out .",
    "clearly more work on this point , and tests of other scaling relations , would be welcome .",
    "( if @xmath658 then @xmath659 is ruled out . ) it is interesting that in both @xmath644 and @xmath462 , @xmath660 and this also holds _ exactly _ in the @xmath67 model  @xcite  this raises the question whether the inequalities ( [ etapsilteta ] ) , ( [ nugeq2d ] ) are saturated ; at present we have no argument why this might be so .",
    "in this section we summarize our main results and discuss their relationship to other open problems .",
    "a comparison of our results with some recent work has already been presented in sec  [ scalinghypoth ] .",
    "we have studied models of quantum rotors or ising spins in a transverse field with random , short - range , frustrating exchange interactions .",
    "we examined properties of these systems in the vicinity of a zero temperature quantum transition between a spin - glass and a quantum paramagnet phase .",
    "we characterized this transition by an order parameter field @xmath661 which is a matrix in spin components ( @xmath13 , @xmath205 ) and replica indices ( @xmath662 ) , and is _ bilocal _ in matsubara time ( @xmath616 , @xmath617 ) .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath127 is the on - site two - spin correlation function which becomes long - range in time at the onset of spin - glass order .",
    "we then introduced a landau effective action functional for @xmath127 : the functional was written down as the most general one consistent with a set of symmetry criteria and the usual landau theory requirements of locality in space and time . the functional involves _ both _ the replica diagonal and off - diagonal components of @xmath127contrast this with classical spin glass  @xcite for which the landau theory involves only the replica off - diagonal components of an order parameter matrix field which is also independent of time .",
    "a mean - field functional minimization of the landau action yielded a great deal of structure . for parameters favoring large quantum fluctuations",
    ", we found a paramagnetic phase whose properties ( as well as those of the quantum - critical point at which the paramagnetic phase terminates ) were identical to those obtained in an earlier exact solution of a model with infinite - range interactions  @xcite . in systems with weaker quantum fluctuations",
    ", we found a replica - symmetric spin glass ground state , with replica symmetry breaking appearing at any non - zero temperature .",
    "we were able to study systematically the behavior of replica symmetry breaking at small @xmath2 , in contrast to the classical sherrington - kirkpatrick model where the order parameter is of order unity as @xmath663 , and no landau expansion exists ( see however ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the present situation",
    ", we used the proximity to a quantum - critical point to our advantage , and developed a landau expansion valid even at @xmath63 .",
    "the response of the spin - glass and paramagnetic phases to a variety of external fields was also studied .",
    "next we examined consequences of fluctuations about mean - field for the critical properties of the quantum transition .",
    "we identified @xmath1 as the upper critical dimension . above @xmath1 , and with certain restrictions on the values of the landau couplings , we found that the transition was controlled by a gaussian fixed point with mean - field critical exponents . for couplings not attracted by the gaussian fixed point above @xmath1 , and for all physical couplings below @xmath1 , we found runaway renormalization group flows to strong coupling .",
    "an important feature of the renormalization group analysis was the appearance of a dangerously irrelevant coupling ( even below @xmath1 ) , which played a role similar , though _ not _ identical , to planck s constant @xmath587 .",
    "as a result certain disconnected correlation functions measuring fluctuations due to quenched disorder were found to be more singular than the corresponding connected correlations which contain quantum - mechanical fluctuations . the structure implied by this dangerously irrelevant coupling was used to motivate a general scaling scenario for the quantum transition , conjectured to be valid even in the region of runaway flows to strong coupling .",
    "we conclude by discussing implications for some related problems .",
    "it would clearly be desirable to extend our results to the case of insulating spin glasses of true quantum heisenberg spins .",
    "unlike the case for quantum rotors , the different vector components of a heisenberg spin do not commute with each other  this leads to berry phase terms in the path integral which can not be removed by any obvious choice of variables , and complicates the problem substantially .",
    "a heisenberg spin model with random infinite - range interactions was studied recently  @xcite and dramatically different behavior was found even at this `` mean - field '' level  the quantum paramagnetic phase was gapless , unlike the fully gapped quantum paramagnet in infinite - range quantum rotor model  @xcite . a starting point for",
    "further analysis might be to obtain a suitable landau action functional whose minimization reproduces the properties of the infinite - range quantum heisenberg model .",
    "a great deal of work  @xcite has appeared recently on another quantum transition in the large dimensionality limit : the metal - insulator transition in mott - hubbard type models .",
    "like the spin - glass problem , the order parameter for this transition is the long - time limit of a correlation function  at short times the correlation is non - zero on both sides of the transition .",
    "the techniques developed in this paper could perhaps be helpful in extending the infinite dimensionality results to the metal insulator transition in finite dimension systems .",
    "while this paper was being written , we learnt of the work of kirkpatrick and belitz  @xcite on the landau theory of a metal - insulator transition in random electronic systems .",
    "while we do not understand the details of their analysis , there does appear to be at least a passing resemblance of their methods to ours  like us , they find it necessary to consider a linear term in the order parameter , to which randomness couples most effectively .",
