    "electrons traveling in vacuum to a measurement apparatus will repel each other because of their mutual coulomb interaction .",
    "if a cloud of electrons is sufficiently dense , this vacuum space charge effect can alter the time , energy , and spatial spread of the cloud , limiting experimental resolution and resulting in systematic measurement errors.@xcite    the space charge effect has been addressed mostly for the design of electron guns for time - resolved electron diffraction experiments @xcite and has been discussed in terms of @xmath0-body numerical simulations , mean - field models , and fluid dynamics .",
    "recently the space charge effect has also been discussed in angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments @xcite , where it has been shown to depend primarily on four parameters : photon energy , pulse duration , incident beam spot size , and the number of electrons photo - emitted per pulse .",
    "these previous studies explored two different regimes : i ) the relatively high photon energy ( @xmath1 ev ) and long pulse duration ( @xmath2 ps)@xcite regime , and ii ) the very low photon energy ( two - photon photoemission with 3 ev photons ) and short pulse duration ( @xmath3 fs ) regime.@xcite the shape of the electron cloud is very different in these two regimes . in the first case ,",
    "the wide distribution of electron kinetic energy and long pulse duration produce a cloud extended mainly along the direction normal to the sample surface , while in the second case the narrow electron kinetic energy distribution and short pulse duration produce a disk - shaped electron cloud parallel to the sample surface .",
    "the former case of a more three - dimensional cloud requires numerical simulations while a disk - shaped cloud can be characterized analytically using a simple power law.@xcite    with the recent advent of laser - based photoemission experiments , the need to extend these studies to an intermediate regime becomes imperative .",
    "a recent study of the space charge effect using laser based arpes with 7 ev photon energy and 10 ps long pulse suggests that the space charge effect plays a minor role in this regime thanks to the mirror charge effect that nearly cancels the space charge effect in the 1 to 10 ps pulse duration.@xcite    here we expand these results by reporting a systematic study of the space charge effect on polycrystalline gold in laser - based photoemission spectroscopy in the intermediate regime of moderate pulse lengths ( @xmath4 6 ps ) and low photon energy ( 6 ev ) .",
    "we find in the limit of small spot size ( @xmath4 20 @xmath5 m diameter ) a shift of the fermi edge on the order of 2 mev and a broadening larger than 10 mev starting already at 100 electrons per pulse .",
    "more generally , we find that a single power law can not describe the broadening or the fermi edge shift as a function of electrons per pulse and spot size in the various arpes regimes . to explore the non - trivial relation between the various experimental parameters , we modeled our data with a molecular - dynamics model which employs full @xmath0-body numerical simulations of the electron propagation from the surface to the detector.@xcite this model is able to reproduce quantitatively the space charge effect seen in the long and short pulse regimes as well as in the intermediate regime explored here .",
    "the large range of applicability of this model allows one to identify the functional dependence of the spectral shift and broadening on the number of electrons per pulse and spot size .",
    "we found that one of the key parameters affecting the different power laws observed in different arpes regimes is the maximum kinetic energy of the initial photo - electron distribution .",
    "we believe that this study will be crucial for guiding next generation high resolution setups .",
    "experiments were performed on a polycrystalline gold sample scratched in air and inserted through a load lock into a uhv analysis chamber at low temperature ( 15 - 20 k ) .",

    "the oscillator generates @xmath4 150 fs pulses at 840 nm at a repetition rate of 54.3/@xmath8 mhz ( @xmath9 ) with pulse energies as high as 100 nj .",
    "the photon energy of the laser beam was frequency - quadrupled via cascaded , type - i phase - matched second harmonic generation in two beta barium borate ( bbo ) crystals of 2 mm and 5 mm thickness .",
    "the resulting 210 nm ( 5.9 ev ) pulse was estimated to be @xmath4 6 ps long due mainly to group velocity mismatch .",

    "this results in a stronger space charge effect , and the edge becomes broader and shifts to higher kinetic energy .",
    "the shift to higher kinetic energy is due to the fact that the electrons at the fermi energy have the highest initial kinetic energy , and therefore the coulomb repulsion of slower photo - electrons can only push them towards higher kinetic energy ( neglecting any mirror charge effects ) .",

    "an offset is added in the case of the photoemission intensity .",
    "the strong correlation between the fermi edge broadening and the photoemission intensity suggests that the angular dependence of the space charge effect is mainly due to the photo - electron emission angular distribution .",

    "while the shift of the angle - integrated spectrum ( @xmath55 mev ) is close to the average value of @xmath60 over @xmath54 , the broadening of the angle - integrated spectrum ( @xmath56 mev ) is significantly larger than the average value of @xmath61 .",

    "in the case of the disk - shaped photo - electron cloud produced by a fs pulse , the broadening due to the space charge effect was proposed to be of the form@xcite @xmath68 on the other hand , for the 60 ps synchrotron pulse , the broadening follows a linear relation with @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath69 ( @xmath70 for the simulation ) dependence we report for this intermediate regime of laser - based arpes with 6 ps pulses is between these two values .",
    "however , these three regimes can not be solely compared on a pulse duration basis .",
    "the fs pulse analysis is based on a surface state peak ( 86 mev fwhm ) measured at the band minimum in the brillouin zone center . in this case , the majority of the photo - electrons have a higher kinetic energy .",
    "this will affect the space charge effect in two ways : i ) the peak position will be shifted to lower kinetic energy ; ii ) the momentum resolution will decrease resulting in a broader spectrum shifted towards higher kinetic energy . while the total shift in energy ends up being negligible , the contribution of the momentum broadening on @xmath28 is not.@xcite this makes a direct comparison difficult but further comparative analysis can be done with our model .    according to the simulation results , the nonlinearity @xmath71 with @xmath72 seems to depend largely on the initial photo - electron distribution .",
    "more specifically , the simulations show that the exponent @xmath73 decreases as the maximum electron kinetic energy decreases .",
    "this exponent is around 1 for high kinetic energies , decreases to @xmath74 in the intermediate regime presented here with a maximum electron kinetic energy of about 1.5 ev , and decreases down to @xmath75 for the fs pulse experiment where the maximum electron kinetic energy was around 1.1 ev.@xcite we found also that the simulation shows no indications that the pulse durations affect this behavior of the exponent @xmath73 .",
    "similarly , we find the broadening dependence on spot size to be proportional to @xmath76 ( @xmath77 for the simulation ) , compared to @xmath78 the fs pulse data , though more experimental data are required here to validate the trend .",
    "it is interesting to note also that the ratio of the two coefficients @xmath73 and @xmath79 is not 1 as for the fs pulse case , but closer to 0.6 - 0.8 .",

    "nevertheless , these results set already a limit in the range in which the analytical model proposed in ref .",
    "in conclusion , we report the measurement of the space charge effect in the few - ps laser pulse regime .",
    "we observe a broadening of the spectral feature exceeding 10 mev and an energy shift exceeding 2 mev with pulses of as few as a 100 photo - electrons for small spot sizes ( @xmath4 20 @xmath5 m diameter ) . for larger spot sizes ( @xmath4 165 @xmath5 m diameter ) similar effects",
    "are observed only as the number of photo - electrons per pulse reaches 600 to 800 .",
