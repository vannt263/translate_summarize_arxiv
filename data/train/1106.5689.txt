    "recent observations of the luminosity of type ia supernovae indicate [ 1 - 3 ] an accelerated expansion of the universe and lead to the search for a new type of matter which violates the strong energy condition .",
    "the matter content responsible for such a condition to be satisfied at a certain stage of evolution of the universe is referred to as dark energy .",
    "the universe is spatially flat which consists of about 70% dark energy with negative pressure , 30% cold dark matters with baryons and some radiation . in the observational cosmology of dark energy , the equation - of - state parameter ( eos )",
    "@xmath0 plays a central role , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are pressure and energy density of the corresponding field respectively . for accelerating expansion of the universe",
    ", the eos of dark energy must satisfy @xmath3 .",
    "to explain the current accelerated expansion , many models have been presented , such as cosmological constant , quintessence [ 4,5 ] , phantom [ 6 ] , quintom [ 7 ] etc .",
    "the simplest candidate of the dark energy is a very small positive time independent cosmological constant @xmath4 , for which @xmath5 .",
    "the cosmological constant remains unchanged while the energy densities of dust matter and radiation decrease rapidly with the expansion of our universe .",
    "many dynamical dark energy models have been proposed as alternatives to the cosmological constant .",
    "we will discuss here two types of dark energy candidates i.e. , holographic and ricci dark energies .",
    "+ the dark energy problem may be in essence an issue of quantum gravity [ 8 ] .",
    "however , by far , we have no any complete theory of quantum gravity , so it seems that we have to consider the effects of gravity in some effective quantum field theory in which some fundamental principles of quantum gravity should be taken into account . the holographic principle",
    "[ 9 ] is just a fundamental principle of quantum gravity , and based on the effective quantum field theory , it is pointed out that the quantum zero - point energy of a system with size @xmath6 should not exceed the mass of a black hole with the same size [ 10 ] , i.e. @xmath7 where @xmath4 is the ultraviolet ( uv ) cut - off of the effective quantum field theory , which is closely related to the quantum zero - point energy density , and @xmath8 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "this observation relates the uv cut - off of a system to its infrared ( ir ) cutoff .",
    "when we take the whole universe into account , the vacuum energy related to this holographic principle can be viewed as dark energy .",
    "the largest ir cutoff @xmath6 is chosen by saturating the inequality , so that we get the holographic dark energy density [ 11 ] @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a numerical constant characterizing all of the uncertainties of the theory , whose value can only be determined by observations . here",
    "@xmath6 is define by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a scale factor and @xmath13 can be obtained from @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the curvature index and @xmath16 is the radius of event horizon [ 12 ] and we get @xmath17 .",
    "on the basis of the holographic principle proposed by [ 13 ] several others have studied holographic model for dark energy [ 14 ] .",
    "employment of friedman equation [ 12 ] @xmath18 where @xmath2 is the total energy density and taking @xmath19 one can find @xmath20 .",
    "thus either @xmath21 or @xmath22 behaves like @xmath23 .",
    "thus , dark energy results as pressureless .",
    "if we take @xmath6 as the size of the current universe , say , the hubble radius @xmath24 then the dark energy density will be close to the observational result .",
    "but , neither dark energy , nor dark matter has laboratory evidence for its existence directly .",
    "+ many candidates such as cosmological constant , quintessence , phantom , holographic dark energy , etc . have been proposed to explain the acceleration .",
    "ricci dark energy , which is a kind of holographic dark energy [ 15 ] taking the square root of the inverse ricci scalar as its infrared cutoff and this model is also phenomenologically viable .",
    "gao et al [ 16 ] proposed the dark energy density proportional to the ricci scalar @xmath25 i.e. , @xmath26 is called the _",
    "ricci dark energy_. this model works fairly well in fitting the observational data , and it could also help to understand the coincidence problem .",
    "moreover , in this model the presence of event horizon is not presumed , so the causality problem is avoided . assuming the black hole is formed by gravitation collapsing of the perturbation in the universe ,",
    "the maximal black hole can be formed is determined by the casual connection scale @xmath27 [ 17 ] , given by @xmath28 for a flat universe , where @xmath29 is the hubble parameter , and if @xmath30 , it could be consistent with the current cosmological observations when the vacuum density appears as an independently conserved energy component .",
    "as we know , in flat frw universe , the ricci scalar is @xmath31 , which means the @xmath27 is proportional to @xmath25 and if one choices the casual connection scale @xmath27 as the ir cutoff , the ricci dark energy model is also obtained .",
    "there are several works on this ricci dark energy model [ 18 ] .",
    "+ in this work , we have first defined the generalized holographic and generalized ricci dark energy models in section ii .",
    "the statefinder parameters in two fluid system has been presented in section iii .",
    "the equation of state and statefinder parameters for generalized holographic and generalized ricci dark energy models without dark matter and with dark matter in non - interacting and interacting scenarios have been calculated in sections iv - vi . in sections vii and viii ,",
    "the equation of state and statefinder parameters for generalized holographic and generalized ricci dark energy models with generalized chaplygin gas in non - interacting and interacting scenarios have been studied .",
    "finally , some fruitful conclusions have been drawn .",
    "xu et al [ 19 ] proposed two types of dark energy models , i.e. , generalized holographic and generalized ricci dark energy models as follows : + ( i ) * generalized holographic dark energy ( ghde ) : * the energy density of ghde is given by ,    @xmath32    where @xmath10 is a numerical constant and @xmath33 is a positive function defined as , @xmath34 , @xmath35 is a constant . when @xmath36 then @xmath37 and when @xmath38 then @xmath39 .",

    "+ it is interesting that when @xmath48 , we recover the energy densities of original holographic and ricci dark energies . also when @xmath39 and @xmath47 , we recover interchangeably the energy densities of original holographic and ricci dark energies . also when @xmath36 and @xmath46 or when @xmath38 and @xmath44 then @xmath49 and @xmath50 both are same . now comparing ( 1 ) and ( 2 )",
    ", we see that when @xmath51 the generalized ricci dark energy reduces to the generalized holographic dark energy and vice versa .",
    "+ the ricci scalar for non - flat frw universe is given by , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 = + 1 , 0 and @xmath54 for closed , flat , and open geometries , respectively .",

    "the einstein field equations for the mixture of dark matter and dark energy are ,    @xmath57    and @xmath58    also the conservation equation is given by    @xmath59    where @xmath60 and @xmath61 denote pressures and @xmath62 and @xmath21 are the energy densities of dark matter and dark energy respectively .",
    "thus here @xmath63 for generalized holographic dark energy and @xmath64 for generalized ricci dark energy respectively .",
    "+ the flat friedmann model which is analyzed in terms of the statefinder parameters [ 20 ] . the trajectories in the @xmath65 plane of different cosmological models shows different behavior .",
    "the statefinder diagnostic of snap observations used to discriminate between different dark energy models .",
    "the statefinder diagnostic pair is constructed from the scale factor @xmath66 .",

    "+ the parameters can be expressed as    @xmath71    @xmath72    and    @xmath73",

    "in this work , we have considered the generalized holographic and generalized ricci dark energy models for acceleration of the universe .",
    "if the universe filled with only ghde and grde the corresponding deceleration parameter , eos parameter and statefinder parameters have been calculated .",
    "the universe will be accelerating if the parameter @xmath35 satisfied @xmath86 for ghde model .",

    "if the universe is filled with the mixture of dark matter and ghde / grde , the equation of state parameters and deceleration obey the negative sign in both interacting and non - interacting scenarios , which derive the acceleration of the universe .",
    "when we consider the mixture of generalized chaplygin gas and ghde / grde , the equation of state parameters and the deceleration parameter also generate negative sign which shows that the combined fluids derive the acceleration of the universe . in all the cases ,",

    "if the universe filled with only ghde / grde , then from the figure 2 , we have seen that when @xmath89 increases , @xmath87 first decreases from positive to negative upto about @xmath94 and then @xmath87 increases from negative to positive . for non - interacting models of ghde",
    ", we have seen from figure 6 that , @xmath87 first increases from some positive value to @xmath115 and after that @xmath87 also increases from @xmath116 to some positive value as @xmath89 increases from negative to positive and from figure 13 , we have also seen that @xmath87 first increases and then decreases as @xmath89 increases and we see that @xmath87 is always positive but @xmath89 keeps negative sign . but for interacting models of ghde , we have seen from figure 10 that , @xmath87 always decreases with positive sign as @xmath89 increases with negative level and from figure 18 that , @xmath87 always decreases from negative level as @xmath89 increases and keeps positive signs .",
