    "centaurus x-3 is the first x - ray source to be discovered as an accretion powered x - ray binary pulsar ( giacconi et al . 1971 ) .",
    "it is one of the brightest accreting x - ray pulsars .",
    "it was discovered from observations made with a rocket - based detector ( chodil et al .",
    "1967 ) and later satellite observations revealed its binary and pulsar nature ( giacconi et al .",
    "1971 ; schreier et al .",
    "the optical companion was found to be an o - type supergiant star v779  cen ( krzeminski 1974 ) that has a radius of @xmath112 r@xmath2 and a mass of @xmath117 - 19 m@xmath2 ( hutchings et al . 1979 ) .",
    "the distance to the binary system is estimated to be @xmath18 kpc ( krzeminski 1974 ) .",
    "it is an eclipsing high mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) pulsar .",
    "the x - ray data show eclipses for @xmath120% of the binary orbit ( see nagase 1989 ) .",
    "the pulse period of the pulsar was estimated to be @xmath14.8 s ( schreier et al . 1972 ) and an orbital period of @xmath12.1 days ( nagase 1989 ) .",
    "the high value of observed luminosity of the pulsar ( @xmath15@xmath310@xmath4 erg s@xmath5 ) suggests that the predominant mode of accretion is via accretion disk , fed by a roche - lobe overflow ( tjemkes et al .",
    "the optical light curve ( tjemkes et al .",
    "1986 ) also indicates the presence of an accretion disk , fed by roche lobe overflow .",
    "the long term rxte - all sky monitor ( asm ) light curve of cen  x-3 shows a succession of high and low intensity states , which appear to be random .",
    "it was found from the rxte - asm data that even in different energy bands , cen  x-3 had a flux @xmath140 times larger during the high / outburst states as compared to the low state ( paul et al .",
    "it was also reported that the low and high states last between a few days to @xmath1110 days , without having any periodicity ( paul et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the broadband , out - of - eclipse phase - averaged spectrum of cen  x-3 has been described by an absorbed power - law , a broad iron emission line at @xmath16.7 kev along with a high energy cut - off at @xmath114 kev ( burderi et al .",

    "a number of emission lines are expected in the x - ray spectrum of this source due to its high x - ray luminosity and the presence of a stellar wind from the companion star at a distance of only 40 lt - s ( kelley et al.1983 ; ebisawa et al . 1996 ; wojdowsky et al .",

    "mg , si , and s were observed along with clearly resolved 6.4 kev , 6.7 kev , and 6.97 kev iron emission lines ( ebisawa et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the three iron emission lines are known to originate from neutral or lowly ionized iron , helium - like iron and hydrogen - like iron , respectively .",
    "a long @xmath10 observation of cen  x-3 , covering nearly one orbital period , revealed the presence of extended dips in the light curve which are rarely seen in hmxbs .",
    "these dips are seen up to as high as @xmath140 kev ( naik et al .",
    "2011 ) . the broad band energy spectrum ( in 0.570 kev range ) obtained from the @xmath10 observations was found to be well described by a partial covering power law model with high energy cut - off and three gaussian functions for 6.4 kev , 6.7 kev , and 6.97 kev iron emission lines .",
    "the observed dips in the x - ray light curve were explained by the presence of additional absorption component with high column density and covering fraction .",
    "the iron line parameters during the dips and eclipse were found to be significantly different compared to those during the rest of the observations .    in the present work ,",
    "we have carried out spectral analysis of cen  x-3 to investigate the emitting regions and evolution of three iron emission lines during eclipse , eclipse - egress and normal intensity out - of - eclipse phases using @xmath0 observations of the pulsar .",
    "for this purpose , we describe the observations , data analysis and results in the following section . then in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the results .",
    "cen  x-3 was observed with @xmath0 on 2001 january 27 with its european photon imaging camera ( epic ) .",
    "the observations were carried out by using medium filters for all three focal plane instruments mos-1 , mos-2 and pn for an exposure of @xmath168 ks .",
    "data from mos-1 camera was not considered in this work as the instrument was operated in `` fast uncompress mode '' . though mos-2 was operated in `` full frame mode '' and pn was operated in `` small window mode '' , the photon pile - up during these observations was negligible for both the cameras .",
    "though the pulsar is very bright in x - rays , the @xmath0 observations were made during the eclipse and eclipse - egress during which a significant fraction of the source photons were blocked by the optical companion . at the same time , the effect of photon pile - up , if any when the pulsar was out - of - eclipse towards the end of the observations , does not have any significant effect on the study of evolution of three closely spaced iron emission lines over orbital phase of the pulsar .",
    "the raw events from pn and mos-2 cameras were processed and filtered using the @xmath0 science analysis system ( sas ) .",
    "the light curves and spectra were extracted from a circular region of 40@xmath11 radius , centered at the source position .",
    "the background light curves and spectra were extracted from source - free regions with a circular region of the same area as the source region .",
    "the epic - pn and mos responses were generated using the sas tasks @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "it is also to be mentioned that there was a background flare during the last 2 ks of the data ( from 66 ks to 68 ks ) .",
    "hence we did not use this portion in our spectral analysis .",
    "light curves were extracted from the event data .",
    "it is found that the pn and mos-2 light curves cover a part of eclipse , eclipse - egress and out of eclipse phases of the binary orbit for a total exposure of about 66 ks .",
    "the 100 s binned light curve , obtained from pn event data , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . the mid - eclipse time ,",
    "beginning of eclipse - egress and the end - of - eclipse of the pulsar are shown in the figure .",
    "the orbital parameters used to determine the mid - eclipse time and end - of - eclipse time are taken from paul et al .",
    "the figure shows that the eclipse egress is smooth and instead of a single linear increase in flux , the count rate profile can be described as several piece - wise linear segments from the eclipse to the out of eclipse .",
    "each letter in the figure represents a certain duration for which time - resolved spectral analysis was carried out .",
    "the eclipse - egress seen in the pn light curve is unlike the sharp rise in the x - ray flux when the source comes out of eclipse due to the binary companion , as seen in case of smc  x-1 ( raichur & paul 2010 ) and lmc  x-4 ( naik & paul 2004 ) . to investigate the peculiar nature of smooth eclipse - egress in cen  x-3 in present analysis",
    ", we compare the hard x - ray light curve ( in 15 - 50 kev range ) of the pulsar obtained from @xmath14/bat monitoring data .",
    "the entire @xmath14/bat light curve of cen  x-3 was folded with the orbital period of the pulsar and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] along with the normalized pn light curve in 0.2 - 10 kev energy band . in the figure",
    ", phase zero corresponds to the mid - eclipse time ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "normalization of the pn light curve was done to compare the orbital modulation such as duration of the eclipse - egress at soft and hard x - rays .",
    "one can see that the eclipse - egress is very sharp in hard x - rays in contrast to what observed in soft x - rays .",
    "this confirms that the beginning of eclipse - egress and out - of - eclipse phases is different at soft and hard x - rays because of absorption / scattering which is different in different energy bands and intensity states of cen  x-3 .    after appropriate background subtraction , simultaneous spectral fitting",
    "was performed using the pn and mos-2 spectra .",
    "the pn and mos-2 spectra for the entire observations were fitted with a power - law continuum model with interstellar absorption and a gaussian function for the fe  i k@xmath15 emission line at 6.4 kev .",
    "all the model parameters other than the relative normalization were tied together for both the detectors .",
    "the spectral fitting was poor with the presence of positive residuals at low energies representing the emission lines from ne , mg , si , s etc . and",
    "at 6.7 kev ( fe  xxv k@xmath15 line ) and 6.97 kev ( fe  xxvi k@xmath15 line ) . as our aim was to investigate the evolution of iron emission lines at different binary phases , the subsequent spectral fitting was restricted to 4 - 10 kev energy range .",
    "two additional gaussian functions were added to the spectral model for 6.7 kev and 6.97 kev iron emission lines .",
    "after a careful investigation of the residuals , we found a mismatch in the value of line energies between mos-2 and pn spectra of the pulsar .",
    "after communication with the @xmath0 help desk , we found that the problem was known to epic calibration team though they had not done any changes at the high energy end of the calibration . considering this , we tried to fit the mos-2 and pn spectra separately with above model and found that all three iron emission lines were present in both the cases .",
    "however , the line energies obtained from mos-2 spectrum were found to be close to the corresponding values obtained from atomic database .",
    "therefore , we used mos-2 data for further spectral analysis . after fitting the mos-2 spectrum with above model",
    ", we found that the spectrum was hard with a photon index of @xmath10.8 .",
    "though the spectral fitting was done in 4 - 10 kev energy range , an interstellar absorption component was required to fit the spectrum and the value of equivalent hydrogen column density was found to be 8.7 @xmath3 10@xmath16 atoms @xmath17 .",
    "considering the energy range of spectral fitting ( i.e. 4 - 10 kev ) and the wide range of source count rate during the observations presented here , the value of estimated hydrogen column density may not be accurate enough to draw any reliable conclusion .",

    "the second and third panels show the ratios of 6.4 kev line flux to that of the 6.7 kev and 6.9 kev lines , respectively whereas the bottom panel shows the ratio of 6.7 kev flux to that of 6.9 kev line .",
    "the ratio of the 6.7 kev line flux and 6.9 kev line flux ( bottom panel ) was found to be approximately constant over the entire observations .",
    "this is a clear evidence that the size of the region in which the 6.7 kev and 6.9 kev lines are produced is comparable to the size of the companion star and not affected significantly due to the eclipse .",
    "significant rise in the flux ratios of 6.4 kev line to that of other two lines ( second and third panels ) as the pulsar comes out of the eclipse confirms the 6.4 kev line emitting region to be located at the close proximity of the pulsar .",
    "based on these findings , it is certain that the origin of the three emission lines are different .",

    "2012 and references therein ) .",
    "the partial covering model consists of two power - law continua with a common photon index but with different absorbing hydrogen column densities .",
    "the choice of the appropriate continuum model , therefore , is very important to understand the properties of the pulsars .",
    "a detailed broad band spectral analysis of the hmxb cen  x-3 with the @xmath10 observatory covering nearly one orbital period showed that the pulsar spectrum was well described by a partial covering power - law model with high energy cut - off and three gaussian functions for iron emission lines ( naik , paul & ali 2011 ) .",
    "as the range of spectral fitting presented here in this paper is limited from 4 to 10 kev to investigate the evolution of iron emission lines , a single power - law continuum model is used in the analysis .    the 6.4 kev k@xmath15 iron emission line has been observed in the spectrum of many x - ray binary pulsars . in some of the binary pulsars , emission lines at 6.7 kev ( e.g. cen  x-3 ; ebisawa et al .",

    "the authors tried to study the spectral variability of the pulsar by dividing the entire observations to two segments ( eclipse and eclipse - egress ) and compared the results with that obtained from the @xmath9 observations . in the process , the intensity variations of the three iron emission lines were detected , the largest variation was for the 6.4 kev k@xmath15 emission line .",
    "the @xmath9 observations of the pulsar covered the pre - eclipse , eclipse - ingress , eclipse , and eclipse - egress using which the line parameters were derived to study the origin of the lines ( ebisawa et al .",
    "1996 ) . in this paper , however , a systematic and detailed investigation of the evolution of three iron emission lines was carried out using the same @xmath0 observations as was used by tugay & vasylenko ( 2009 ) . in the process , as many as twelve measurements of line parameters were made during the eclipse , eclipse - egress and out - of - eclipse phase of the binary orbit of the pulsar .    in the present work",
    ", we found that the intensity of the 6.4 kev iron emission line varies significantly with the 5 - 10 kev source flux . during the eclipse , it was minimum ( @xmath12@xmath310@xmath26 ergs @xmath17 s@xmath5 ) which increased to maximum (",

    "the increase in the 6.9 kev line flux was similar to that of the 6.7 kev flux .",
    "the change in flux of iron emission line flux for all three lines are gradual as the 5 - 10 kev source flux from the eclipse to out - of - eclipse phase of the orbital period .",
    "the equivalent widths of 6.7 and 6.9 kev lines were maximum during the eclipse which became minimum during the out - of - eclipse phase , whereas it is opposite in case of the 6.4 kev line .",
    "the relative flux variabilities of the three iron emission lines are clearly shown in fig .",
    "significant increase in the 6.4 kev line flux compared to that of 6.7 kev and 6.9 kev lines as the pulsar moves from the eclipse to out - of - eclipse phase confirms that the 6.4 kev line emitting region is being obscured during the eclipse .",
    "as the pulsar comes out of the eclipse , the k@xmath15 line emitting region gradually becomes visible and enhances the flux of the emission line .",
    "however , the marginal increase in the flux of other two emission lines as the pulsar moves out of eclipse suggest that the corresponding line emitting regions are spread over large area and distributed far away from the pulsar . this allows a small fraction of the 6.7 kev and 6.9 kev energy photons to be blocked by the eclipse due to the companion star .",
    "the results confirm that the origin of the 6.4 kev emission line is different from that of the 6.7 and 6.9 kev emission lines in cen  x-3 .",
    "the 6.4 kev line is originated due to the fluorescence of cold and dense material that is very close to the neutron star where as the other two lines are produced in a region that is far from the neutron star , probably in the highly photo - ionized wind of the companion star or in the accretion disk corona .",

    "<S> we present the results obtained from a study of the variability of iron emission lines in the high mass x - ray binary pulsar cen  x-3 during the eclipse , eclipse - egress and out - of - eclipse phases using @xmath0 observations . </S>",
    "<S> three iron emission lines at 6.4 kev , 6.7 kev , and 6.97 kev are clearly detected in the spectrum of the pulsar during the entire observations , irrespective of different binary phases . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of these emission lines are investigated at different intensity levels . </S>",
    "<S> the flux level and equivalent width of the emission lines change during the eclipse , eclipse - egress and out - of - eclipse orbital phases . </S>",
    "<S> based on the results obtained from the time resolved spectral analysis , it is understood that the most probable emitting region of 6.4 kev fluorescent line is very close to the neutron star whereas the other two lines are produced in a region that is far from the neutron star , probably in the highly photo - ionized wind of the companion star or in the accretion disk corona .    </S>",
