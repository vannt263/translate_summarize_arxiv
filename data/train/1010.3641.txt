    "dls collaboration _ more than 10 years ago have demonstrated that theoretical models at the time ( see , e.g . refs .",
    "@xcite failed to give a satisfactory account of the measured @xmath0 pair invariant mass spectra .",
    "in particular , such spectra from @xmath5 , and @xmath6 collisions substantially exceed those predicted by the model calculations in the dielectron mass @xmath10 region @xmath11 gev/@xmath7 and reference therein ) .",
    "dls _ finding called the `` dls puzzle '' was recently confirmed by the _",
    "hades collaboration _ @xcite and now it is regarded as firmly established .",
    "since the shortage of dielectrons in calculated spectra became apparent , several theoretical groups have attempted to understand its origin .",
    "the emphasis mainly concentrated on the development of suitable models describing the conventional elementary processes of @xmath0 pair production @xcite .",
    "these processes are believed to be associated with the production in @xmath1 collisions of neutral mesons ( m ) , such as @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , ... , and baryon resonances ( r ) , such as @xmath15 , @xmath16(1520 ) , ... , which can undergo the dalitz decay @xmath17 , or the vector mesons @xmath18 , and @xmath14 which can directly decay into into @xmath19 pairs , and the @xmath1 virtual ( timelike ) photon bremsstrahlung @xmath20 . nevertheless , despite considerable efforts the nature of the discrepancy between the calculated and measured spectra noted above is still obscure .",
    "the shortage of dielectrons in calculated spectra could indicate the existance of an additional source of @xmath0 pairs that was not included in the model calculations .",
    "one of such possible sources is due to the @xmath1-decoupled dibaryon resonance @xmath2(1956 ) .",
    "this resonance @xcite can be produced in the radiative process @xmath21 and decays in that @xmath22 .",
    "it has been found that it manifests itself in a series of experimentally studied photon production processes induced by nucleon - nucleon and nucleon - nucleus collisions at intermediate energies @xcite .",
    "however , we know little about the physical nature of this resonance and do not yet know its quantum numbers .",
    "we only know that its spin @xmath23 and parity @xmath24 can be either from a set @xmath25 , etc . if its isospin @xmath26 or any if @xmath27 .    at the same time , if the resonance @xmath28 really exists then together with its formation ( decay ) channel with a real photon the same channels with a virtual , massive photon should also take place .",
    "conversion of such photons into @xmath19 pairs would give rise to a new source of dielectrons .",
    "however the virtual photons from the @xmath2 decay should have relatively small masses which do not exceed the kinematical limit @xmath29 gev@xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the mass of the resonance and the sum of masses of nucleons from this decay , respectively .",
    "therefore this process can not have to do with the shortage of dielectrons in question . in this paper",
    "we examine the @xmath0 pair production mechanism associated with the @xmath2 formation in @xmath1 collisions due to virtual photon emission and show that its contribution to the invariant mass spectra of the dielectron from @xmath9 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 collisions at 1.0 gev / a can supply the observed shortages of @xmath19 pairs in these spectra in the region @xmath11 gev/@xmath7 .",
    "the process to be considered is @xmath33 with @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the four - momenta of the colliding nucleons , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 are the four - momenta of the electron , the positron and the dibaryon , respectively , and @xmath40 is the four - momentum of the virtual photon .",
    "the kinematical region for its mass @xmath10 is @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the electron mass and @xmath43 is the total cms energy of colliding nucleons .",
    "this mass region overlaps with that where the shortage of dielectrons of interest was observed .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath44 collisions at a kinetic energy of the incident protons @xmath45 gev the upper limit for the dielectron mass is @xmath46 gev .",
    "the matrix element @xmath47 for the process ( 1 ) can be written as @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the hadronic and leptonic electromagnetic transition currents , respectively , and @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the operators of these currents .",
    "note that the same current @xmath53 also describes the process @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is a real photon . in this case , however , the space part @xmath56 of this current is always perpendicular to the momentum @xmath57 of the photon .",
    "the space part @xmath56 of the current @xmath53 for the process ( 1 ) can , in general , have both a transverse @xmath58 and a longitudinal @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) component , so that @xmath61 .",
    "the square of the matrix element ( 2 ) can be represented in terms of a transverse and a longitudinal components of @xmath56 as@xcite : @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the longitudinal and transverse components of the momentum @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "the quantities @xmath58 and @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) depend on the quantum numbers of the @xmath66 and its electromagnetic structure .",
    "we assume in this work that the @xmath28 has spin zero and isospin two",
    ". the general structure of the electromagnetic transition from an initial @xmath67 state to a final pointlike @xmath66 state with such quantum numbers has been investigated in the work @xcite and found to be of the magnetic type .",
    "the square of the matrix element for the magnetic dipole ( @xmath68 ) transition @xmath69 derived in the @xcite is given by @xmath70 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the four - momenta of the colliding nucleons , and @xmath71 is a certain normalization constant .",
    "the fundamental property of an electromagnetic current for the magnetic type transition with a real or virtual photon is that its components satisfy the conditions @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the square of the matrix element ( 3 ) for such a transition between an initial state @xmath74 and a final state @xmath66 takes the form @xmath75 spectra calculations and comparison with dls data -------------------------------------------------    the differential cross section @xmath76 for the production of a dielectron of invariant mass @xmath10 in the process ( 1 ) is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the masses of the colliding nucleons and @xmath81 is the form factor for the @xmath82 transition . in our calculation",
    "we used the form factor predicted by the vector dominance model : @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the mass and width of the @xmath86 meson , respectively .",
    "the integral ( 6 ) was calculated by the monte carlo method .",
    "the phase space region of the integration was limited by the _ dls _ apparatus acceptance that was given by the corresponding filter provided by the _ dls collaboration_. in calculations the finite mass resolution of the _ dls _",

    "@xcite was used .",
    "the calculated spectrum was normalized in such a way that the ratio of the value of the calculated total cross section @xmath89 for the process ( 1 ) at the cms energy @xmath43 of the colliding nucleons to the total cross section @xmath90 for the process @xmath91 is equal to the conversion coefficient @xmath92 given by @xcite @xmath93.\\ ] ] using eq .",

    "the constant @xmath71 entering into eq .",
    "( 9 ) was found from the equality @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the cms energy of the @xmath44 system for the kinetic energy of incident proton @xmath101 .",
    "the value @xmath102 was derived from data on the measurement of the two - photon ( @xmath103 ) invariant mass distribution of the @xmath104 reaction at @xmath101 gev made by the _ celsius - wasa collaboration _ @xcite .",
    "the surprising feature of this distribution is a pronounced resonant structure at a mass of about 280 mev .",
    "it was shown in our work @xcite that this structure is due to the dibaryon mechanism @xmath105 of the studied reaction .",
    "the contribution of this mechanism to the @xmath103 invariant mass distribution of the reaction @xmath104 together with the experimentally measured distribution are shown in fig.2 . here",
    "we also show the @xmath103 background calculated under the assumption that its differential cross section @xmath106 is inversely proportional to the @xmath103 invariant mass @xmath107 .",
    "a fit of the sum of the contributions from the dibaryon mechanism and the background to the experimental @xmath103 invariant mass distribution gives for the cross section @xmath108b .",
    "the total cross section of the background in the mass region of the observed structure was estimated to be 1 @xmath109b .",
    "the dielectron invariant mass spectra predicted by theoretical models that take into account only the conventional processes of dielectron production ( solid lines ) for the case of @xmath9 @xcite ( left panel ) and @xmath6 @xcite ( right panel ) collisions at 1.04 gev compared to the corresponding _ dls _ data ( solid circles ) @xcite and @xcite , respectively are presented in fig .",
    "the short dashed lines show the dibaryon mechanism contributions calculated by eq . 6 that includes the form factor ( 7 ) , and",
    "dotted lines show such contributions calculated by eq .",
    "6 without it .",
    "the dashed and dot - dashed lines represent the sums of the corresponding spectra predicted by the theoretical models and the dibaryon mechanism contributions calculated with and without the form factor ( 7 ) , respectively .",
    "2 shows that adding the dibaryon mechanism contributions to the dielectron invariant mass spectra predicted by the theoretical models that take into account only the conventional processes of dielectron production we get a very good agreement between resulting spectra and experimental data .",
    "note that the reliability of the numerical values of the calculated contributions of the dibaryon mechanism of dielectron production @xmath110 is provided for by the fact that its total cross section was normalized to the experimentally measured total cross section of the process @xmath111 .",
    "similar results were obtained for the case of @xmath5 collisions at 1.04 gev / c .    the presence or absence of the dibaryon mechanism of @xmath0 pair production",
    "can be established by measurement of the missing mass spectrum in the reaction @xmath112 .",
    "if this mechanism really exists it should manifest itself in such a spectrum as a narrow peak at a mass around 1956 mev superimposed on a smooth background .",
