    "for zero - temperature superfluids the only allowed vortex configurations are string - like objects , the so - called vortex lines . these have a quantized circulation , and a microscopic , atomic - size thickness @xcite .",
    "for ordinary fluids one can have much more general vortex configurations , but it is still possible ( and fairly easy ) to set up a long - lived string - like vortex , with a thickness that is much smaller than its other typical length scales . in both cases ,",
    "the position and shape of a vortex line is a placeholder for a fairly complicated bulk fluid flow : vorticity is localized on the line , but the velocity field away from it is non - trivial ( albeit irrotational ) .",
    "for instance , for a straight line it circulates with a @xmath0 profile .    as a result ,",
    "the equation of motion for the line itself is a complicated integro - differential ( and therefore non - local ) equation , which is typically attacked numerically ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "it is natural to expect , however , that such a complicated equation of motion can be replaced by a _ local _ effective action for a string coupled to the bulk modes of the fluid , with the usual conceptual and practical advantages that such a transition  from equations of motion to lagrangian and from non - local action at a distance to local interaction with fields  entails .    in the present paper",
    "we systematically develop such an effective string theory , generalizing and completing the program begun in @xcite .",
    "this lagrangian was also studied in the nonrelativistic limit in the related work @xcite , where it was derived from the gross - pitaevskii model , and in particular it was used in  @xcite to analytically study the instability modes of propagating vortex rings .",
    "as we will see , the irrotational bulk fluid flow can be described in terms of a two - form field , whose excitations decompose under an appropriate choice of gauge into sound waves and the non - dynamical ` hydrophoton ' field . the two - form can be coupled to ( 1 + 1)-dimensional vortex line defects through a kalb - ramond term , and the energetics and other microscopic properties of the string can be encoded in a derivative expansion generalizing the familiar nambu - goto action .",
    "our first result is a general effective action compatible with the symmetries of the system : poincar invariance , which is spontaneously broken by the medium , reparameterization invariance on the string worldsheet , and the gauge invariance associated with the two - form field . for strings living in empty space rather than in a medium , the ` bottom - up ' picture for effective string theory was investigated in @xcite and more recently considered in the context of qcd flux tubes in @xcite .",
    "it is worth stressing that while a fundamental ( i.e. , uv - complete ) theory of strings is only consistent with lorentz invariance at the quantum level in 26d ( or 10d with worldsheet supersymmetry ) , a low - energy effective theory of strings is possible in any number of dimensions .",
    "this effective theory will be valid at distances much greater than the core size , and higher derivative corrections will encode information about the microscopic degrees of freedom making up the string .",
    "once the system is described in terms of a local effective action , one can apply standard field theoretical ideas and techniques to analyze it .",
    "we will discuss how renormalization works in our case , and how to use the resulting rg running of low - energy couplings to streamline certain classic computations as well as to efficiently perform new ones .",
    "in fact , we will see that for many purposes the bulk modes can be integrated out ; since they are gapless , however , the resulting worldsheet effective theory is not local .",
    "the non - locality is very mild though , and can be phrased as a simple rg evolution for certain couplings localized on the worldsheet .",
    "in particular , the classic logarithms appearing in a number of physical quantities concerning vortex lines @xcite  from their energy per unit length to the spectrum of kelvin waves  can be understood in this way .",
    "such logarithmic running at the classical level arises quite generally when the dynamics of a codimension - two brane  which in our case is just the worldsheet spanned by the vortex line ",
    "couples to fields in the bulk@xcite .",
    "we should emphasize that although for this paper we will be mostly interested in the classical dynamics of vortex lines , it is straightforward to apply our formalism to problems at the quantum level as well , and we will present a sample quantum computation in sect .  [",
    "sec : phonon absorption ] .",
    "moreover , in the following we will refer almost exclusively to the superfluid case , but everything we say ( apart from quantum effects ) applies to ordinary fluids as well . in particular , for irrotational fluid flows there is a duality between superfluids and ordinary fluids directly at the level of the lagrangian @xcite , and so in sect .",
    "[ two form ] we start directly with the superfluid lagrangian , with the understanding that that covers both cases .",
    "it should be mentioned that , for ordinary fluids , vortex lines will eventually decay away due to viscosity ( like any other type of fluid flow ) .",
    "within the regime of validity of the hydrodynamical description , however , viscosity effects are of higher order in the derivative expansion , and thus negligible in the first approximation . in this limit",
    "kelvin s theorem holds , and as a result the circulation of a vortex line is conserved in time and along the line , and the line thickness stays small .",
    "our paper is long , and not all readers will be interested in all of it .",
    "we feel that sects .",
    "[ reparameterization ] , [ sec : power counting ] , and [ sec : small ] can be omitted without impacting the general flow , although sect .",
    "[ sec : non - relativistic limit ] will be particularly relevant for readers interested in the non - relativistic case .",
    "conventions : _ we use the @xmath1 metric signature and @xmath2 units throughout the paper .",
    "from a qft standpoint , superfluids are systems in which a spontaneously broken @xmath3 charge @xmath4 is at finite density @xcite . at zero temperature and at sufficiently large distances and time - scales ,",
    "their dynamics are dominated by the single goldstone excitation ( the _ phonon _ ) that follows from the breaking of @xmath4 . in the relativistic case",
    ", the low - energy effective action for the goldstone @xmath5 can be written in the following compact form  @xcite s = d^4 x p(x ) , x= - _ ^ , = |t + , where the sign in the definition of @xmath6 is chosen as to make @xmath6 positive for our choice of signature , @xmath7 is the equilibrium chemical potential for @xmath4 , and @xmath8 is an a priori arbitrary function whose precise form is determined by the superfluid equation of state .",
    "notice that the background value @xmath9 breaks lorentz invariance .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that for the superfluid  like for any other condensed matter system  there is a preferred reference frame :  the one in which the system is at rest .",
    "starting from the action ( [ f(x ) ] ) , it is easy to check that the stress - energy tensor is that of a fluid with energy density , pressure and 4-velocity given respectively by = 2 x p(x ) - p(x ) , p = p(x ) , u_= - . since the 4-velocity @xmath10 is the gradient of a scalar ( up to a normalization factor ) , it obeys a relativistic version of the irrotationality condition and thus describes potential flow  as befits a superfluid .    the effective description of a relativistic superfluid provided in ( [ f(x ) ] )",
    "is very economical , in that it makes use of a single scalar field @xmath11 to describe the dynamics of a goldstone @xmath5 .",
    "however , this is not the only possibile description .",
    "it is in fact known  @xcite that in @xmath12 dimensions , the theory of a scalar field whose action is invariant under a global shift symmetry @xmath13 admits a dual formulation based on a 2-form field @xmath14 whose action is invariant under local gauge transformations of the form a _ a _",
    "+ _ _ - _ _ ( see also  @xcite for a pedagogical derivation ) .",
    "dimensions , the scalar field is dual to a @xmath15-form @xmath16 . ] for a non - linear theory such as the one we are considering , the effective action for the dual theory is s = d^4 x g(y ) , y = - f_f^ , f^= ^_a _ .",
    "the gauge - invariant quantity @xmath17 is the analogue for a 2-form field of the dual electromagnetic field strength @xmath18 , and the function @xmath19 is in one - to - one correspondence with our function @xmath8 , as we now explain .",
    "starting from ( [ g(y ) ] ) , it is easy to show that the stress - energy tensor is still that of a fluid , but now with = -g(y ) , p = g(y ) - 2 y g(y ) , u_= - .",
    "the precise relation between the scalar @xmath11 and the 2-form @xmath14 then can be obtained by comparing the expressions for the 4-velocity in ( [ hydrox ] ) and ( [ hydroy ] ) , - = - , as well as the expressions for the density and pressure .",
    "we find that the functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 are related simply by a legendre transform ( when expressed as functions of @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) : @xmath24 from a thermodynamical viewpoint , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the most natural variables to use :  they are the local chemical potential and number density , = x , n = y .",
    "then , @xmath8 expresses the pressure as a function of @xmath27 , and @xmath19 expresses ( minus ) the energy density as a function of @xmath28 .",
    "our legendre - transform relations above correspond to the standard zero - temperature thermodynamic identities dp = n d , d = dn , + p = n .    from a field - theoretical viewpoint , the important point to stress is that although eqs .  ",
    "provide a local relation between the _ derivatives _ of @xmath11 and @xmath14 , the corresponding relation between the two fields is highly non - local .",
    "this is a standard feature of dualities in field theory , and means that if one picture admits local terms in the lagrangian in which some fields appear without derivatives , then these very same terms will look highly non - local in the dual picture .",
    "this is the reason why we are introducing the two - form formulation of the superfluid effective theory in the first place : it turns out that the most relevant local coupling between phonons and vortex lines involves an undifferentiated @xmath14  @xcite , and thus can not be easily rewritten in terms of the scalar  @xmath11 .",
    "language  @xcite . ] from a microscopic perspective , this fact has a simple explanation : a vortex line is just a low - energy proxy for a topological defect in the @xmath11 effective theory , and in the presence of such a defect , @xmath11 becomes the winding angle and is not single - valued .",
    "something similar happens in electromagnetism , where the gauge potential is not single - valued in the presence of a magnetic monopole , but it is possible to write a local coupling between the monopole and the dual gauge potential @xmath29 , which is related to the dual field strength by @xmath30 .    before turning to the study of vortex lines though",
    ", we will explicate the duality between @xmath11 and @xmath14 by showing explicitly that the effective action ( [ g(y ) ] ) describes a single gapless degree of freedom  the superfluid phonon . in order to study the spectrum of excitations in the 2-form language",
    ", we first need to determine what background @xmath31 corresponds to the lorentz - violating background @xmath9 . to this end",
    ", we can evaluate equation ( [ relation ] ) on the background to obtain ( for the @xmath32 and @xmath33 components respectively ) & ^ijk _",
    "i a_jk = - |n , + & ^ijk ( 2 _ j a_0k - _ 0 a_jk ) = 0 , where the parameter @xmath34 is , according to ( [ mun ] ) , simply the background number density .",
    "the most general solution to the equations ( [ bkgdconditions ] ) then is a_0i = -f_ij(t)x^j , a_ij = -13 |n _ ijk x^k + f_jk(t )  , where @xmath35 is an arbitrary function of time only . on the one hand",
    ", it should not come as a surprise that the background ( [ abackground ] ) is not completely specified given that the action ( [ g(y ) ] ) for @xmath14 has a gauge invariance . on the other hand",
    ", we can use this gauge invariance to further simplify our result and set @xmath35 to zero via a large gauge transformation with parameters @xmath36 . in conclusion , we find that a suitable background value for @xmath14 is a_0i = 0 , a_ij = -13 |n _ ijk x^k  .",
    "let us now study the linear behavior of fluctuations around such a background .",
    "we can parameterize them using two 3-vectors @xmath37 and @xmath38 , a_0i = |n a_i ( t , ) , a_ij = |n _ ijk  [ - 13 x^k + b^k ( t , ) ] , where the normalization chosen is convenient for what follows . then",
    ", we will add to our action ( [ g(y ) ] ) a gauge fixing term of the form s_gf - d^4 x ( _ i a^i ) ^2 .",
    "notice that there is no real disadvantage in choosing a gauge fixing term that is not covariant , given that lorentz invariance is spontaneously broken by the background ( [ bkgd ] ) anyway . on the contrary , we will see that this gauge fixing term proves to be particularly advantageous in the @xmath39 limit , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 lend themselves to a simple physical interpretation .",
    "if we now expand in perturbations the action ( [ g(y ) ] ) supplemented with the gauge fixing term ( [ gf ] ) , and we use the expression @xmath40 , we find the quadratic part of the action to be @xmath41 \\la{s2 } \\\\ & -   \\dot{\\vec{b}}\\cdot(\\vec{\\nabla } \\times \\vec{a } ) - { { \\textstyle\\frac{1}{2\\xi } } } ( \\vec{\\nabla } \\times \\vec{b})^2   + { { \\textstyle\\frac{1}{2\\xi } } } ( \\vec{\\nabla } \\cdot \\vec{a})^2 \\big\\ } \\ ; , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the background enthalpy density , and we have introduced the speed of sound squared @xmath43 , also evaluated on the background .    after switching to fourier space , it is fairly straightforward to invert the kinetic term to find the propagators . for arbitrary values of @xmath44",
    ", the final result looks quite complicated and involves non - vanishing mixed propagators of the form @xmath45 .",
    "the explicit expressions as well as more details on the derivation can be found in appendix  [ appa ] . in the rest of the paper",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the @xmath39 limit , in which case great simplifications occur and the propagator matrix becomes diagonal .",
    "the propagators for @xmath37 and @xmath38 are then respectively = ( ^ij - k^i k^j ) , = , where the usual @xmath46 prescription is understood .    taking the @xmath39 limit amounts to imposing @xmath47 , which is the 2-form analogue of the coulomb gauge in electromagnetism . in terms of our 3-vectors @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    ", this is equivalent to demanding that @xmath48 .",
    "thus , in this gauge , @xmath38 is purely longitudinal and @xmath37 is purely transverse .",
    "moreover , we see from ( [ propagators ] ) that in this gauge @xmath38 describes the only propagating degree of freedom  the phonon  whereas @xmath37 is a coulomb - type constrained field that does not propagate any additional degree of freedom :  it is ( minus ) the ` hydrophoton ' of ref .  @xcite .",
    "when switching to a different gauge , @xmath37 and @xmath38 change as a a + - _ 0 + , b b + , where we have reabsorbed the @xmath49 contribution to the gauge variation of @xmath37 into the longitudinal part of @xmath50 ; such a redefinition does not affect the gauge variation of @xmath38 .",
    "physical quantities like those of eq .",
    "are gauge invariant , and thus must be functions of the gauge - invariant combinations b , - a . for instance , the four - velocity field is given by u^(x ) ( 1 - b , -a ) , suitably normalized . by comparing with the standard form @xmath51",
    ", we see that the three - velocity is [ fluid3velocity ] = .",
    "as we have seen , to lowest order in derivatives the bulk dynamics of a superfluid are described by the action for a two - form field @xmath14 . if we now consider a thin string - like object living in the superfluid  such as a vortex line  to zeroth order in the core thickness we can parameterize its dynamics by the positions of its line - elements @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is a coordinate along the string . as is the case for standard relativistic string theory , here",
    "too it is convenient to introduce reparameterization invariance for the time coordinate and use @xmath54 instead of the more physical  i.e .",
    ", less redundant@xmath52 , where @xmath55 and @xmath53 are now two arbitrary world - sheet coordinates ( more on this in the following section ) .    with @xmath56 we can now construct lagrangian terms localized on the world sheet of the string .",
    "as we did for the @xmath11 and @xmath14 of last section , we can write arbitrary powers of @xmath57 , but we need to work perturbatively in further derivatives .",
    "the reason is that the typical background configurations we will be interested in are of the form ~|t , a _ ~|n x , x^~ ( , ) , which have _ large _ first derivatives , but vanishing second derivatives , and so our power - counting scheme is the correct one for perturbation theory about these backgrounds . the symmetries that we have to impose are poincar - invariance , gauge - invariance for @xmath14 , and world - sheet reparameterization invariance .",
    "in fact , there is no a priori reason why we should impose this last symmetry ( apart from the fact that we are used to it ) .",
    "we will explicitly address the physics behind it in the next section , but for the moment we will take it for granted and move on .",
    "the whole point of trading @xmath11 for @xmath14 in the last section was to write a local coupling between bulk modes and a string - like defect directly at the level of the potential ( rather than the field - strength ) .",
    "here it is : s d d a _",
    "_ x^_x^ , where @xmath58 is a coupling constant .",
    "such a term is the only invariant that involves @xmath14 without derivatives .",
    "it is the analogue of @xmath59 for a point - charge in electromagnetism , and @xmath58 thus plays the role of a charge per unit length .",
    "furthermore , we can also write nambu - goto ( ng)-type terms : [ ng with g ] s_ng d d , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 run over @xmath62 , and @xmath63 is _ any _ bulk tensor that can play the role of a spacetime metric . for standard relativistic strings in empty space",
    "the only available structure is @xmath64 , which leads to the ng action . here instead the underlying medium spontaneously breaks lorentz - invariance , and we can use its four - velocity u^(x ) = - as well as the scalar @xmath65 to construct new tensors .",

    "we can apparently generate infinitely many inequivalent terms of the form , and it is not immediately clear what kind of general structure can emerge from taking their sum . to address this question ,",
    "we will use a standard result of bi - gravity theories  @xcite : given two metric tensors @xmath67 and @xmath68 in @xmath69 spacetime dimensions , the most general diff - invariant , zero - derivative lagrangian one can write down is [ bigravity ] d^d x f ( ( g^-1 h)^ _ ) , where @xmath70 is a function that is invariant under similarity transformations @xmath71 but is otherwise generic . for our world - sheet , @xmath72 and we can take the two independent induced metrics to be g _ = _ _ x^_x^ , h",
    "_ = u _ u _ _ x^_x^ . the fact that @xmath68 is degenerate ( it is a rank - one matrix ) does not impair the argument .    to figure out how many independent invariants of @xmath73 we have",

    "the number of independent nonzero components of @xmath73 in any such basis is the number of independent invariants . for",
    "any given worldsheet point @xmath74 , we can perform a lorentz boost and align the minkowski time with the underlying fluid flow at that point , @xmath75 . then",
    ", we can perform a lorentz rotation and make the @xmath76 direction tangent to the world - sheet at that point , and via a world - sheet diff we can make @xmath55 and @xmath53 locally the same as @xmath77 and @xmath76 , so that we have @xmath78 . in conclusion , at that point , in these coordinates we have g _ = _ , h _ = _ ^0 _ ^0 , and @xmath79 has only one nonzero entry , the @xmath80 one .",
    "therefore , we only have one independent invariant , which in a general coordinate system we can take to be the trace , g^ h _ , where @xmath81 is the inverse of @xmath67 .",
    "we should note that in our case the function @xmath82 in can also be supplemented with a scalar argument , our @xmath65 , which is invariant under all the symmetries .    to summarize ,",
    "the interactions of a relativistic superfluid and of a string - like defect living in it can be modeled in terms of a two - form field @xmath83 and of the embedding coordinates of the string @xmath84 .",
    "to lowest order in the derivative expansion and up to gauge - fixing terms , the low - energy effective action is the sum of three distinct structures : s = s_bulk + s_kr + s_ng  , with    @xmath85    the first piece encodes the bulk dynamics of the superfluid .",
    "the a priori generic function @xmath21 is completely determined by the equation of state , via the relation = - g(n^2 ) , where @xmath86 and @xmath28 are the densities of energy and charge for the superfluid .",

    ", the function @xmath87 is a functional generalization of the string tension .",
    "when expanded in perturbations about a background configuration , it yields a finite number of couplings at each order in perturbation theory , which in principle can be fixed by experiment .    before using the action above for a number of concrete computations , we would like to pause for a moment and go back to the question of world - sheet reparameterization invariance .",
    "readers uninterested in this technical detour can safely skip to sect .",
    "[ expansion ] .",
    "as is the case for gauge symmetries in general , reparameterization invariance is more properly thought of as a statement of redundancy rather than one of symmetry . in most physically relevant situations ,",
    "gauge redundancy is a property of a gauge field .",
    "this may or may not be a dynamical field .",
    "for example , the former class includes the physical electromagnetic and gravitational fields , and the latter class includes the non - dynamical metric we introduce to describe non - gravitational field theories in curved space in a coordinate - independent fashion .",
    "however , for a string with tension @xmath88 described by the nambu - goto action , [ ng ] -td d , g _ _ _ x^_x^ , the role of such a gauge field is played by the world - sheet induced metric .",
    "since the induced metric is a given functional of the embedding fields @xmath89 and nothing else , the redundancy associated with reparameterization invariance must now be a property of those fields . and",
    "it is a _ physical _ property , in the sense that it relies on certain ( implicit ) physical assumptions about the object that the ng action is supposed to describe . to identify what these are , it is convenient to analyze reparameterizations of @xmath55 and @xmath53 in turn .",
    "reparameterization invariance for @xmath55 is just a convenient technical trick to implement _ manifest _ lorentz invariance .",
    "this is already evident for a relativistic point particle with mass @xmath90 and trajectory @xmath91 , whose action can be written in two physically equivalent forms : -m dt = -md .",
    "the first form only involves the physical field @xmath91 , but at the same time obscures lorentz invariance , which acts by mixing such a field with its argument  time .",
    "the second form accomplishes manifest lorentz invariance , but it does so at the expense of introducing an arbitrary , lorentz - scalar parameter @xmath55 along with a redundant field @xmath92 . to work with the non - redundant degrees of freedom only , one can always choose the `` physical '' gauge , @xmath93 , and end up with the first form of the action .",
    "reparameterization invariance for @xmath53 is more interesting . to appreciate why",
    ", it is convenient to work in physical gauge for @xmath55 ( @xmath94 ) , in which case the nambu - goto action reduces to a functional of the spatial position field @xmath95 : -td t d .",
    "this is still invariant under general , _ time - dependent _ reparameterizations of @xmath53 ,  ( ,",
    "t ) = + ( , t ) , under which our dynamical field @xmath52 shifts by x x + _ x , where we have kept terms up to first order in the transformation parameter @xmath44 . at any given point along the string , @xmath96 is a vector locally tangent to the string , and @xmath44 is an arbitrary function of time and @xmath53 .",
    "invariance under the transformation above thus means that _ motion and deformations along the string are unphysical_. this is a very physical , concrete statement .",
    "for instance , an infinite straight string formally oscillating in a longitudinal mode , x ( t , ) = ( + a ( k - t ) , 0 , 0 ) , carries _ no _ energy associated with such oscillations : its action and energy are identical to those of the unperturbed configuration , @xmath97 .",
    "only the transverse oscillations carry energy .",
    "the physical origin of this behavior can be traced to the fact that the string in question does not break spacetime symmetries  in particular , lorentz invariance_along itself_. for instance , its stress - energy tensor is the lower - dimensional analogue of that of a cosmological constant . as a consequence , motion or deformations like compression or dilation along the string",
    "are unphysical :  there is no way to move , compress , or dilate a cosmological constant .",
    "the fields @xmath52 , which transform non - trivially under spacetime symmetries , parameterize the physical goldstone modes for the symmetries broken by the string  transverse translations , rotations , and boosts  but _ have _ to be redundant when it comes to parameterizing the goldstone of a symmetry that is not broken in the first place .    perhaps the best way to appreciate all this is through a counterexample  a concrete example of a string system that does not feature the properties above .",
    "we do not have to look very far : consider any ordinary string - like object in the real world , such as a violin string .",
    "the material that makes up such a string is a _",
    "solid _ , and as a consequence , the symmetry breaking pattern of spacetime symmetries along the world - sheet must be that of a solid . in 1 + 1 dimensions , boosts and translations",
    "are broken along with an internal shift symmetry down to an unbroken combination that ensures the homogeneity of physical properties in the ground state ( see e.g.  @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "the resulting string action to lowest orders in derivatives is : [ solid string ] d d f ( ( ) ^2 ) , where @xmath67 is the same induced metric appearing in the ng action ( [ ng ] ) , and @xmath98 keeps track of the comoving coordinates of the solid : it is a world - sheet field specifying which solid line - element occupies position @xmath53 at time @xmath55 .",
    "the implicit contraction in @xmath99 is done through @xmath81 , and @xmath100 is a function determined by the equation of state for the solid : in coordinates locally comoving with the solid ( @xmath101 ) , the world - sheet stress - energy tensor has  @xcite [ ws rho p ] = -f , p = f - 2 f ( ) ^2 .",
    "( [ solid string ] ) is clearly reparameterization invariant , with @xmath11 transforming as a world - sheet scalar , but it involves one extra degree of freedom @xmath11 compared to the nambu - goto action .",

    "however , now this action is not reparameterization invariant for @xmath53 . either way , one has one more physical degree of freedom compared to a string described by the nambu - goto action .",
    "this additional degree of freedom corresponds to the longitudinal mode of motion or deformation of the string , which for a solid string is as physical as the transverse ones : it is the goldstone mode associated with the spacetime symmetries broken _ along _ the string .",
    "we can thus conclude that a string parameterized by the ng action can be thought of as a string made up of _ cosmological constant _ , which is quite different from being made up of an ordinary solid material . as a check ,",
    "notice that if in ( [ ws rho p ] ) we take the cosmological - constant limit , @xmath102 , we get @xmath103 , @xmath11 disappears from the action , and we recover the ng action . with hindsight , now we can also appreciate that reparameterization invariance for @xmath55 is not that automatic after all :  it relies on the implicit assumption that time - translations are unbroken on the world - sheet . a string made up of _ supersolid _ material",
    "@xcite would violate this assumption .",

    "in fact , it is the most general function of the induced metric .    in conclusion :  as usual , reparameterization invariance can always be achieved by adding redundant degrees of freedom .",
    "however , there are situations in which it can be achieved by using only the degrees of freedom that are already at one s disposal , such as , for instance , our embedding fields @xmath105 . in those situations ,",
    "reparameterization invariance is equivalent to the statement that some of _ those _ degrees of freedom are redundant  a property that may or may not be featured by the system under consideration .",
    "so , what about our vortex lines ?",
    "vortex lines in fluids and superfluids are defined as loci of non - zero vorticity .",
    "the only quantitative measure of how large vorticity is on them is the circulation @xmath106 , which is constant along each line .",
    "such a geometric characterization does not associate any physical meaning to motion or deformation of the lines along themselves . in particular , only their shapes and their overall @xmath106 s are sufficient to reconstruct everywhere the incompressible part of the surrounding velocity field  @xcite .",
    "it is thus natural to postulate that their world - sheet action is reparameterization invariant already when using just the embedding fields @xmath105 , precisely the same as for the ng action .",
    "we would like to stress that  however consistent and natural - sounding  this is still an _",
    "assumption_. it is not clear how to ascertain which symmetries are broken by the string along its worldsheet , since the surrounding medium is already breaking some of these longitudinal symmetries  e.g .",
    "lorentz boosts . certainly , given the discussion above , if we were to describe a solid string moving in a superfluid , we should give up @xmath53-reparameterization invariance .",
    "that is because we have an idea of what a solid is on its own , in the absence of the surrounding superfluid . in the case of our vortex lines instead , there is no such thing as a vortex line without the surrounding superfluid .",
    "however , vortex lines in superfluids are intrinsically quantum objects , and their characterization purely in terms of semi - classical concepts like the vorticity of the fluid flow might well turn out to be incomplete . for instance",
    ", it is not obvious to us why quantum effects could not endow the string with some  materiality \" , that is , solid - like physical properties which would imply the existence of gapless longitudinal degrees of freedom .",
    "ultimately , this is a question that has to be settled by experiment . for the time being , we content ourselves by noticing that for vortex lines in non - relativistic _ classical _ fluids , the reparameterization invariant action of @xcite ( and reproduced here ) yields the correct equations of motion as implied by the euler equation .",
    "we thus postulate reparameterization invariance for vortex lines in superfluids as well .",
    "to use the action we derived in sect .",
    "[ action for lines ] for concrete computations in perturbation theory , we should expand it in powers of the fields . to begin with",
    ", it is important to realize that , within the regime of validity of the effective theory , the string can only move slowly .",
    "this is not to say that we should take the fully non - relativistic limit : the speed of sound @xmath107 can still be relativistic ; but the local speed of the string has to be much slower than @xmath107 . to see this , recall that the circulation @xmath106 is the line integral of the velocity field taken around the string .",
    "so , at distances @xmath108 from the string the fluid has a typical velocity @xmath109 . imposing that this be sub - sonic all the way down to distances of order of the string core radius @xmath110",

    "we can thus expand our action in powers of @xmath115 .",
    "notice that , thanks to the kalb - ramond coupling @xmath116 , the expansion starts at _ first _ order in the velocities .",
    "this is quite different from standard mechanical systems in empty space , for which the kinetic action starts at quadratic order in the velocities , and it is the reason behind the peculiar mechanical behavior of a vortex line ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",

    "however , it is straightforward ( albeit tedious ) to check that , to the order we are working , both discrepancies can be fixed via non - linear field redefinitions : a a - ( ) b , x x + b ( x , t ) . for what follows it",
    "is more convenient to stick with our original parameterization of the fields and not perform these field redefinitions .",
    "we close this section by noticing that the action of @xcite  which reproduces the correct dynamics of vortex lines in ordinary fluids as derived from the hydrodynamical equations  lacks our generalized nambu - goto piece @xmath120 .",
    "this is surprising : such a piece is allowed by all the symmetries , and enters our action at the same order in derivatives as all the other terms that we are keeping ; by the standard rules of effective field theory , it should be there .",
    "we will see below that its absence in the results of @xcite is illusory : the zero - thickness limit for a vortex line is notoriously singular , with many physical observables diverging logarithmically already at the classical level ; our @xmath120 term will be needed to correctly renormalize the theory in that limit .",
    "we will now explain in detail how this works , and how in fact we can use such logarithmic divergences to our advantage . for simplicity , we will restrict ourselves to classical processes , because many aspects of renormalization and running will be relevant already there ; however , the same ideas and techniques can be extended to quantum effects as well .",
    "our vortex - line action , eq .  , is not localized on the string worldsheet : it includes terms that are integrated over the volume of the surrounding superfluid . as a result ,",
    "even for the simplest physical processes such as the free vibration of a infinite straight string , there is a constant interplay between the worldsheet modes ( @xmath56 ) and the bulk ones ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "this makes computations complicated .",
    "the bulk modes can be formally integrated out  at least when they do not appear in the initial or final state  but , being gapless , they yield a non - local effective action for the worldsheet ones  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is at the origin of the apparent non - locality of the standard vortex - line equations of motion , which involve biot - savart - type integrals  @xcite : the line is just the ` tip of the iceberg'it is a placeholder for a quite complicated and highly delocalized velocity profile in the surrounding superfluid .",
    "however , it is well known that for many processes taking place at length scales much longer than the vortex - line thickness , things drastically simplify and one can approximate the equations of motion with local ones  @xcite .",
    "this goes under the name of the lia  local induction approximation .",
    "we will now see that the lia and similar but more general approximations can be understood in rg terms : for a variety of processes , the leading non - local effect mediated by the bulk modes can be captured by a logarithmic scale - dependence for a worldsheet _ local _ coupling .",
    "that is , we will be able to dispose of most of the bulk modes and replace them with running couplings for a purely local worldsheet theory .",
    "this classical running of couplings on defects has been studied in the context of braneworld models @xcite .",
    "the bulk modes that can not be gotten rid of in this way are of course the asymptotic states , which can be absorbed , scattered , or emitted by the string .",
    "these will be kept explicitly , and will interact with the string via worldsheet localized ( running ) couplings .    to carry out this program systematically , one should follow for example @xcite and adapt the technology developed there to our case .",
    "we will discuss some of the systematics of the expansion in  7 , but we will leave the full development of the effective theory for future work . for the moment , we will just analyze a few examples of how these ideas can drastically simplify certain computations .",
    "it is well known ( see e.g. @xcite ) that the classical energy per unit length of a vortex line is formally divergent , scaling like the log of an infrared cutoff ( e.g. , the size of the container ) over a uv cutoff ( e.g. , the line thickness ) . from a field - theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "the uv divergence is harmless , since it can be canceled by a local counterterm .",
    "the ir divergence , however , is interesting : it signals that the corresponding coupling will run with scale .    to see how this works , consider a straight , infinite vortex line , at rest in an unperturbed superfluid .",
    "we have x ( , t ) = ( 0 , 0 , ) , where we chose the gauge @xmath134 .",
    "such a line will source some static @xmath37 and @xmath38 fields in the bulk , through the interaction terms @xmath135 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\equiv \\int d^4 x \\big [ \\vec j_a \\cdot \\vec a + \\vec j_b \\cdot \\vec b \\big ] \\label{ja jb } \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have rewritten the world - sheet localized interactions formally as bulk sources , which is convenient for the computations that follow . for our simple configuration ,",

    "we can solve the lowest - order equations of motion for @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and plug the solutions into the energy functional , which for our static configuration to lowest order reads e = dz t + d^3 x .",
    "such a computation would parallel the standard hydrodynamical one , in which the bulk energy of the string configuration is simply the kinetic energy of the rotating fluid ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , we can use more field - theoretical methods based on the effective - action formalism ( see e.g.  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "this is more general and can be extended straightforwardly to quantum phenomena as well ; we will therefore carry out the computation in this way .",
    "the idea is to formally perform the path - integral over @xmath37 and @xmath38 , for given @xmath136 fields , e^i s_eff[x ] = a d b e^is[x , a , b ] .",
    "to lowest order , this shifts the effective action of @xmath136 by [ seff ] s_eff[x ] d^4 x d^4 y  , where the @xmath19 s are the propagators .",

    "the shift in the energy thus is e - , where the propagators have to be computed at zero frequency , and the @xmath138 s now stand for purely spatial fourier transforms .    including the tension contribution",

    "the second term is the standard hydrodynamical result , which is due to the kinetic energy of the surrounding fluid .",
    "the third term is due to sound - mode exchange and , to the best of our knowledge , has not appeared in the literature .",
    "notice that we are formally keeping the uv cutoff @xmath141 separate from the physical thickness of the line @xmath142 ( always with @xmath143 , to trust our computations ) , to emphasize its arbitrariness : the uv cutoff should be interpreted as a formal device to carry out the renormalization program , but ultimately one wants to express long distance observables in terms of physical parameters that can be measured at long distances .",
    "related to this , unless one knows exactly how this ` thickness ' is realized ( is there a step - function in the vorticity ?",
    "an exponential drop - off ? ) , the precise value of @xmath142 does not have a well defined meaning anyway .",
    "so , it is not wise to have it appear in predictions for long - distance observables . on the other hand ,",
    "the ir cutoff @xmath144 is physical :  it can be interpreted as the typical scale of the process .    as usual , to remove the uv - cutoff dependence from a physical , measurable quantity  the energy per unit length  we have to move it to a lagrangian ` bare ' coupling  the tension . if we parameterize @xmath88 as t = t ( ) + ( / ) + ^2 , where @xmath27 is an arbitrary renormalization momentum scale and @xmath145 is finite , then eq .   is manifestly finite : = t ( ) + ( l ) . [ energy mu ]    formally now the energy depends on an arbitrary reference scale @xmath27 , but in practice there are unambiguous physical predictions : for instance , for containers of different sizes the energies per unit length differ by |_l_1 - |_l_2 = ( l_1/l_2 ) . following standard rg ideology ,",
    "this is conveniently rephrased in terms of a _ running tension _ : for the physical quantity @xmath146 to be independent of the arbitrarily chosen scale @xmath27 , @xmath145 has to change whenever @xmath27 is changed , in such a way as to leave @xmath146 unchanged : [ running t ] t ( ) = - , t ( ) = - ( /_0 ) , where @xmath147 is a fixed scale , to be determined by experiment .",
    "then , when evaluating the string energy for a container of typical size @xmath144 , one can conveniently choose @xmath148 and simply get |_l = t(1/l ) . comparing the energies for two different container sizes",
    "now corresponds to making the tension ` run ' from @xmath149 to @xmath150 : |_l_1 -    above .",
    "we will see below how this viewpoint can significantly simplify certain computations .",
    "notice that , upon renormalization , there is no remnant of the quadratic divergence in ( the term due to sound - exchange ) : for instance , the energy does not depend on the coupling @xmath126 anymore .",
    "this is the fate of all power - law divergences : they can renormalize local couplings  in this case , the tension  but they have no measurable consequences at long distances . for this reason , sometimes it is useful to use a regularization procedure in which all power - law divergences are automatically set to zero ; dimensional regularization (  dim - reg \" ) has this property .",
    "perhaps more importantly , it also has the property of respecting gauge invariance  something we have not been careful about so far . for these reasons , from now on we will use dim - reg as the uv regulator . the uv - divergent integrals in eq .   then become @xmath151 + \\frac1{2\\pi } \\log(\\mu l ) \\label{dim - reg } \\\\",

    "a statement that we should be able to prove within our effective field theory , and that would then apply to more general cases as well .",
    "further evidence for the non - renormalization of @xmath58 comes from the fact that the kalb - ramond term , being the integral of a two - form over a two - dimensional world - sheet , is invariant under generic spacetime diffeomorphisms .",
    "this part of the action then has a highly enhanced symmetry compared to the rest ; it is unlikely ( though not impossible ) that interactions that violate this symmetry yield contributions to the effective action that respect it .    to prove such a non - renormalization theorem within our effective theory , we first notice that @xmath58 can not receive quantum corrections that depend on the other couplings .",
    "the reason is that the kalb - ramond term is the only term in the action that is invariant under gauge transformations @xmath214}$ ] only _ up to a total derivative_. since all the other terms in the action are gauge invariant with no need to integrate by parts , they would remain so even if their coupling  constants \" were in fact arbitrary functions of the coordinates . on the other hand ,",
    "the kalb - ramond term is gauge invariant if and only if @xmath58 is a constant .",
    "this means that the renormalization of @xmath58 can not depend on the other couplings , because that would make @xmath58 spacetime dependent whenever the other couplings are .",
    "although very powerful and probably familiar to many readers , this argument is not sufficient by itself to rule out the possibility that the kalb - ramond term renormalizes itself . to prove that this is impossible ,",

    "although by dimensional analysis we do expect @xmath147 to be of order of @xmath193 , we will refrain from being too specific about their relation : as we hope we have made clear , the truly robust prediction of our effective field theory is the dependence on the ir scale @xmath165 , = - .",
    "if the actual value of @xmath147 is needed , it is better left as something to be fit for , for instance by measuring the energy it takes to set up a string in a container of given size @xmath144 .    upon quantization ,",

    "perhaps this makes them uninteresting from a physical standpoint .",
    "still , it would be interesting to check their existence via numerical simulations : to the best of our knowledge , they have not appeared in the literature .",
    "in fact , in the standard vortex - filament model the local induction approximation would break down for @xmath230because the typical distance between the spires of the helix @xmath231 would become smaller than the local radius of curvature @xmath228thus making it difficult to extend the analysis of kelvin waves to non - linear amplitudes . on the other hand ,",
    "our rg considerations are still valid and show that the tension has to be evaluated at @xmath165 rather than @xmath232 : the field theory does not know that the amplitude @xmath228 is physically a length scale ; thanks to its own ignorance , like sikorsky s famous bumblebee , it can fly farther .",
    "as another application of the same set of ideas , consider a perfectly circular vortex ring of radius @xmath228 in an otherwise unperturbed superfluid .",
    "as is well known  @xcite , such a ring moves at a constant speed of order v ~ r / a , where @xmath106 is the circulation , and @xmath142 is typically taken to be on the order of the inverse core size .",

    "in this appendix we provide an alternative derivation of our effective action for vortex lines based on the coset construction  @xcite for spontaneously broken space - time symmetries  @xcite .",
    "this technique has been recently applied to a variety of systems ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , and we refer the reader to  @xcite for a nimble review of this formalism .",
    "our goal here is to use this technique to confirm that the generalized nambu - goto action ( [ ng ] ) is indeed the most general worldsheet action one can write with one derivative acting on each field . along the way , our analysis will also provide a nice illustration of how coset calculations can be simplified by temporarily introducing a fictitious hierarchy between symmetry breaking scales .    for simplicity",
    ", we will base our discussion on the symmetry breaking pattern that arises in the scalar field language ( where time translations are broken , but spatial translations are not ) . since the generalized nambu - goto term ( [ ng ] ) depends on the bulk fields only through the 4-velocity @xmath357 , the scalar field is as good as the 2-form when it comes to this part of the worldsheet action",
    ". a more responsible approach would be perhaps to take as starting point the symmetry breaking pattern of the 2-form language ( where spatial translations are broken , time translations are not ) , because this would also allow us to recover the non - derivative kalb - ramond coupling between vortex line and sound .",
    "however , since the 2-form theory is gauge invariant , this would require dealing with an infinite number of non - linearly realized symmetries .",
    "such a construction is feasible  @xcite but more involved than the one we will present here .",
    "let us consider a superfluid with a perfectly straight vortex line embedded in it , and let us work in the limit of infinite volume and infinite vortex length .",
    "such a configuration spontaneously breaks several symmetries .",
    "some of these symmetries would be broken even in the absence of the vortex line , namely boosts , because the superfluid as a whole admits a preferred reference frame in which it is at rest , and also particle number @xmath4 and time translations , which are broken down to the diagonal linear combination   ( this is in fact the defining property of a superfluid  @xcite ) .",
    "some other symmetries are instead broken only because of the vortex line , and these are the translations in the directions perpendicular to the vortex and rotations around these same directions .",
    "the only symmetries that are left unbroken are translations along the vortex line , rotations around it and , as already mentioned , a linear combination of particle number and time translations .",
    "to simplify our calculations , we will exploit the fact that in principle there could be a hierarchy between the interatomic length scale at which boosts and particle number are broken , and the vortex core size , which sets the scale where the additional translations and rotations get broken .",
    "it just so happens that in superfluids these two length scales are comparable , but in general the former can be much smaller than the latter , as is the case for vortex lines in ordinary fluids . for our purposes , it will actually be convenient to work in the limit where the core size is much larger than the interparticle separation . in a first approximation , this amounts to consider a system where boosts and particle number are _ explicitly _ broken , but there is still an effective notion of unbroken time translations .",
    "this follows from a universal property of systems featuring spontaneous symmetry breaking : when the symmetry breaking energy scale is raised , the associated goldstone bosons become more and more weakly coupled , among themselves as well as to other sectors ; in the limit in which the goldstones become invisible , the corresponding symmetry can be thought of as being explicitly broken .",
    "the symmetry breaking pattern we are interested in thus is = \\ {    l p_0 + p_3 + j_3 +    .",
    "= \\ {    l p_1 , p_2 p_n + j_1 , j_2 j_n .    .",
    "only at the very end will we restore lorentz and reparameterization invariance , by reintroducing the 4-velocity of the medium @xmath357 as a spurion field .",
    "we will base our construction on the coset parameterization = e^i ( t p_t + z p_z ) e^i ^n p_n e^i ^n j_n , where @xmath358 are the coordinates on the worldsheet and @xmath359 are goldstone fields .",

    "^-1 _ i e_^(p_+",
    "_ ^n p_n + _ ^n j_n + a_j_z ) .",
    "the explicit form of the coefficients @xmath361 and @xmath362 can be easily calculated using the algebra of translations and rotations . for our purposes",
    ", the most important quantities are going to be @xmath363 and @xmath364 .",
    "the former plays essentially the role of a vielbein , in that @xmath365 is an invariant integration measure on the worldsheet , whereas the latter are the covariant derivatives of the goldstones @xmath366 .",
    "because @xmath367 \\sim p_n$ ] , we can impose the inverse higgs constraints  @xcite @xmath368 and solve them to express the goldstones @xmath369 in terms of the @xmath366 s .",
    "the fully nonlinear result reads : _",
    "n = _ nm _ 3 ^m  ( )  , where @xmath370 and @xmath371 .    by using this result , we can express @xmath372 and @xmath363 solely in terms of the goldstones @xmath366 .",
    "in particular , since @xmath373 , these quantities are of higher order in the derivative expansion and thus negligible at low energies . following the usual coset mantra  @xcite , at lowest order in derivatives",
    "the most general invariant lagrangian can be written by taking @xmath374-invariant contractions of @xmath375 .",
    "the corresponding action is s = d t d z e ( _ 0 _ n _ 0 ^n ) , with    e & = & + _ 0 _",
    "n _ 0 ^n & = & .    in order to connect our result ( [ s3 ] ) with the generalized nambu - goto term ( [ ng ] ) , it is sufficient to notice that the quantities above can be rewritten in terms of the 4-velocity at rest @xmath376 and the gauge - fixed embedding @xmath377 as follows :    e & = & = + _ 0 _ n _ 0 ^n & = & 1 + = 1 -  .",
    "thus , we conclude that the action ( [ s3 ] ) can be rewritten in a manifestly covariant and reparameterization - invariant form as s = dd f ( g^ h _ )  . in fact",
    ", this is the _ only _ way to rewrite this equation ( [ s3 ] ) in a way that restores both lorentz and reparameterization invariance at the same time . up to an additional dependence on @xmath321 , which we missed because we worked in the limit of where the @xmath3 baryon number is explicitly broken",
    ", this result agrees with equation ( [ ng ] ) .",
    "in this section we derive the feynman rules for the canonically normalized nonrelativistic scalar action d^d x which includes our quadratic kelvon action eq .   as a special case with @xmath378 , @xmath379 , and @xmath380 .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that , despite the formal similarity between the kelvon case and the non - relativistic massive particle one , for the former the parameter @xmath90 can not be interpreted as a mass .",
    "we use the so - called relativistic convention for the normalization of the one - particle states , | = ( 2e_p)(2)^(d-1)^(d-1)(- ) , 1 = |p | which , when combined with the mode expansion _ c(x ) = a_k e^-i(_k t - ) _",
    "c^*(x ) = a^_k",
    "e^+i(_k t - ) , gives 0 | _ c ( ) | = e^-i(e_p t -p ) and so every external scalar line has a factor of @xmath381 .",
    "note that this is the ( non - relativistic ) energy associated with the lagrangian above , @xmath382    the infinitesimal cross section for absorption of a single phonon into @xmath28 kelvons is d= |m(p n)|^2 d_n where @xmath383 is given by [ defm ] _ 1 , _",
    "n |(s-1)| = ( 2)^d^d(p - p_1 - p_n ) i m and the @xmath28-body phase space is d _",

    "the final dimension of the cross section is therefore = -1 + n(d-1 ) +",
    "2(d + - n ( ) - ) - d = d - d + 1 . for @xmath385 , @xmath386 ,",
    "this has the dimensions of length , as expected .",
    "in this appendix , we rederive the non - relativistic effective action discussed in section [ sec : non - relativistic limit ] by taking the formal limit @xmath387 of the relativistic action ( [ effs ] ) . in order to take this limit correctly",
    ", one must keep in mind that the arbitrary functions appearing in the effective action ( [ effs ] ) have a non - trivial dependence on the speed of light . in order to illustrate this point ,",
    "let us revert for a moment to the scalar field description of a superfluid and consider a very specific equation of state , namely @xmath388 with @xmath389 constant .",
    "such a superfluid is described by the effective action ( [ f(x ) ] ) with p(x ) = |p ( / |)^1 + c^2/ c_s^2 , = , where @xmath390 and @xmath7 are once again the pressure and chemical potential at equilibrium .",
    "since we are eventually interested in taking the @xmath313 limit , we have explicitly reintroduced all factors of @xmath278 . as a consistency check",
    ", one can plug this particular form of @xmath20 into equations ( [ hydrox ] ) and see that indeed @xmath391 .",
    "the factor of @xmath392 is there because @xmath86 is an energy density , and not a mass density .",
    "then , from equation ( [ lx ] ) , one immediately sees that the background values of the derivatives of @xmath20 with respect to @xmath22 scale for @xmath393 like  ( ) ^n , ( c c_s ) .",
    "therefore , the quadratic lagrangian for the goldstone @xmath5 in the @xmath393 limit reduces to _ 2 = [- ( ) ^2 ] + ^2  [ - ( ) ^2 + ^2 ] . as usual , the coefficient in front of the @xmath169 term sets the magnitude of the field fluctuations with a given wavelength .",
    "since we want the size of these fluctuations to remain finite while we take @xmath313 , we introduce the canonically normalized field _",
    "c and take the @xmath313 limit while keeping @xmath394 constant . if we now express the effective lagrangian in terms of @xmath394 , expand it in series around @xmath395 and keep in mind that the derivatives of @xmath20 scale with @xmath396 as shown in equation ( [ scalingx ] ) , we  find = _",
    "n=0^ ( - |)^n = _",
    "n=0^ [_c - c_s^2 + ( 1/c^2 ) ] ^n .",
    "thus , we see that in the non - relativistic limit @xmath313 the low - energy effective lagrangian depends only on the galilean - invariant combination @xmath397 .    the key input that allowed us to derive this result was the scaling behavior ( [ scalingx ] ) , which we obtained starting from the particular @xmath20 shown in ( [ lx ] ) .",
    "however , our result  namely the fact that the nonrelativistic action must be a function of the combination @xmath398 ( schematically)is completely general and it applies to nonrelativistic superfluids with an arbitrary equation of state  @xcite .",
    "this is because the scaling ( [ scalingx ] ) itself can be derived from very general considerations .",
    "in fact , from the quadratic lagrangian ( [ l2x ] ) we see that the speed of sound for a generic equation of state is given by @xmath399 evaluated on the background @xmath400 , with each prime denoting a derivative with respect to @xmath22 .",
    "we used primes to indicate derivatives with respect to @xmath6 or @xmath321 , whereas in this appendix they will denote derivatives with respect to the square roots @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "this change of notation will help to streamline the discussion in this section , hopefully without generating confusion .",
    "] now , we would like the sound speed @xmath107 to be much smaller than @xmath278 over a large range of values of chemical potential , and not just for one particular value @xmath7 . this can be arranged provided @xmath401 is not only small , but also varies sufficiently slowly with @xmath7 , which means |  ( ) 0 .",
    "similarly , it is easy to show that @xmath402 , and so on . the scaling relation ( [ scalingx])and therefore the non - relativistic limit ",
    "is completely determined within the effective theory once we require that the speed of sound be smaller than the speed of light for generic boundary conditions .",
    "let us now see how all this works in the 2-form language .    we can repeat a similar analysis and determine how the derivatives of @xmath21 depend on the ratio @xmath396 .",
    "we will proceed in three steps .",
    "first , we can use the relation between @xmath86 and @xmath403 given in ( [ hydroy ] ) ( remember that there the prime stood for @xmath404 ) together with the fact that when @xmath405 is small and approximately constant we have @xmath406 to obtain = - - .",
    "second , we can combine this result with the definition of the sound speed , @xmath407 , to determine the size of the second derivative of @xmath19 : = - .",
    "finally , we impose that @xmath405 be small ( compared to @xmath392 ) over a large range of values of @xmath210 .",
    "this means that @xmath408 must have only a mild dependence on the @xmath210 , or equivalently that |n  ( ) 0 , and similarly @xmath409 and so on .",
    "as we can see , the derivatives of @xmath21 do not scale like the derivatives of @xmath20 : @xmath410 behaves like @xmath411 in that they both grow like @xmath412 , but all other derivatives of @xmath19 are of the same order ( in units of @xmath210 ) and remain constant when @xmath313 .",
    "this should be contrasted with the scaling for the derivative of @xmath8 in equation ( [ scalingx ] ) .",
    "we are now in a position to determine the canonical normalization of our fields @xmath37 and @xmath38 . to this end , let us expand the action up to quadratic order to get _ 2 = - ( a - ) ^2 + ( b)^2 |p [ ( a - ) ^2 - ( b)^2 ] .",
    "this shows that the canonically normalized fields are a_c |p^1/2 a , b_c |p^1/2 .",
    "these are the fields that we need to keep fixed while taking the limit @xmath313 .",
    "in fact , by doing so @xmath23 admits a well defined nonrelativistic limit , as we can see if we rewrite in terms of the canonically normalized fields : = |n(1 - ) \\ { 1- + ( 1/c^4 ) } keeping in mind the equations ( [ yscaling1])([yscaling2 ] ) , we find that in the @xmath313 limit the bulk action ( [ sbulk ] ) reduces to s _",
    "x [ - |p v  ( c_s b_c/ |p^1/2 ) ] , where we have introduced a new dimensionless function @xmath413 whose derivatives are all of order 1 . in particular , with our parameterization we have @xmath414 and @xmath415 .    notice that all interactions are suppressed by the same quantity , namely @xmath416 . since in the nonrelativistic limit",
    "the energy density is dominated by the rest mass , we have @xmath417 , which means that @xmath416 is just the square root of the mass density @xmath418 .",
    "after all , given that sound waves are perturbations of the medium that change the local mass density , it should not come as a surprise that their self - interactions are suppressed by the mass density at rest : local compressions are small ( large ) when they lead to a small ( large ) _ relative _ change in density .",
    "this argument suggests that the ratio @xmath419 must be related to the relative density fluctuation @xmath420 . to find the precise relation between these two quantities ,",
    "we can express the 4-velocity of the superfluid given in ( [ uy ] ) in terms of the canonically normalized fields and then take the @xmath313 to find that the 3-velocity  is u . using this result , we find that the lagrangian ( [ nrl ] ) takes the usual form for a nonrelativistic fluid , i.e. = - |_m c_s^2 v(_m / |_m ) , provided we identify the mass density with _",
    "m |_m ( 1 - b_c/ ) |_m + _",
    "m. we have therefore recovered the non - relativistic bulk action in eq .",
    "( [ s^nr_bulk ] ) .    now that we have figured out that the correct way to implement the nonrelativistic limit is to send @xmath313 while holding @xmath421 and @xmath422 fixed , it is easy to repeat the same procedure for the worldsheet part of the action .",
    "let us start with the kalb - ramond type interaction .",
    "keeping in mind that the coupling @xmath58 can be expressed in terms of the circulation @xmath106 as shown in equation ( [ lambda ] ) , our starting point becomes s_kr = dd a _ _",
    "x^_x^where we have @xmath423 , and we have added the overall factor of @xmath424 based on dimensional analysis .",
    "let us now rewrite this equation in terms of the canonically normalized fields @xmath421 and @xmath422 defined in ( [ canab ] ) .",
    "if we now fix the time reparameterization by imposing that @xmath425 and use once again the fact that @xmath426 in the nonrelativistic limit , we get s_kr |_m d t d  [ - x _ t _ x +  ( a_c _ x + b_c _ t _ x ) ] . as we can see , any dependence on the speed of light drops out and therefore the nonrelativistic limit does not bring about any simplification .",
    "fortunately , this is not true for the rest of the worldline action , which we will see simplifies considerably when we let @xmath313 .",
    "we start from the generalized nambu - goto term s_ng = - d d ( g^ h _ , y ) . as we have seen in section [ runningcouplings ] , this term is not only compatible with all the symmetries , but it is in fact necessary to absorb the logarithmic divergences that arise when vortex lines interact with the bulk fields . in turn , calculating the coefficients in front of these logarithmic divergences gave us a sense of what is the natural size of the function @xmath87 and its derivatives .",
    "more specifically , we have seen that the order of magnitude of the background value of @xmath87which , up to a factor of @xmath278 , is just the tension @xmath88and its derivatives with respect to @xmath427which we denoted with @xmath428is t ~t_(0n ) ~. we calculated the case of @xmath126 in detail , and the general result follows by considering the diagram where we generalize to have @xmath28 insertions of @xmath429 couple to the hydrophoton loop . once again , we have appropriately restored the powers of @xmath278 based on dimensional analysis .",
    "the derivatives of @xmath87 with respect to @xmath335 have instead a nontrivial dependence on the ratio @xmath312 and scale like t_(n0 ) ~  ( ) ^n .",
    "strictly speaking , in section [ runningcouplings ] we only considered a diagram with the emission of a single phonon , and thus we only determined the magnitude of @xmath127 .",
    "however , it is easy to convince oneself that a diagram with emission of @xmath430 phonons such as in fig .",
    "[ fig : tn0figure ]        the scaling relations ( [ t scaling ] ) and ( [ tn0 scaling ] ) suggest that we extract an overall factor of @xmath434 from the function @xmath87 .",
    "then , we can expand the quantities appearing in ( [ ngrepeat ] ) for large values of @xmath278 as      where @xmath122 is the 3-velocity of the superfluid defined in ( [ 3v ] ) , and then combine these results with @xmath435 to find that when @xmath313 the generalized nambu - goto term reduces to s_ng |_m ^2 d t d | x | f  ( , ) , where we have introduced a dimensionless function @xmath82 whose magnitude and derivatives are all of order @xmath436 .",
