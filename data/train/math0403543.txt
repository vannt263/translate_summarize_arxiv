    "<S> it is clear that if two hyperplane arrangements have the same relative topology , then they have the same topology , but the converse is not known .    in </S>",
    "<S> a well - known and very cited work  @xcite , g.  rybnikov found an example of two line arrangements @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the complex projective plane @xmath6 having the same combinatorics but different topology . </S>",
    "<S> the most common way to prove that two topologies of line arrangements are different is to check that the fundamental groups of their complements are not isomorphic .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the authors of this work have provided an example of two line arrangements with different relative topologies ( see  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of  @xcite is that it refers to real arrangements , that is , arrangements that admit real equations for each line ( note that rybnikov s example can not have real equations ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the proof proposed by rybnikov has two steps . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath7 , @xmath8 .    1 .   [ r1 ] recall that the homology of the complement of a hyperplane arrangement depends only on combinatorics . </S>",
    "<S> this way , one can identify the abelianization of @xmath9 and @xmath10 with an abelian group @xmath11 combinatorially determined . </S>",
    "<S> rybnikov proves that no isomorphisms exist between @xmath9 and @xmath10 that induce the identity on @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , this result proves that both arrangements have different relative topologies . </S>",
    "<S> the reason can be outlined as follows : any automorphism of the combinatorics of rybnikov s arrangement can be obtained from a diffeomorphism of @xmath6 , and hence it produces an automorphism of fundamental groups . </S>",
    "<S> since any homeomorphism of pairs @xmath12 induces an automorphism of the combinatorics of @xmath13 , after composition one can assume that any homeomorphism of pairs induces the identity on  @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> + the strategy rests on the study of the lower central series ( lcs ) . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath4 and @xmath5 are constructed using the maclane arrangement @xmath14 ( see example  [ mclane - rlz ] ) , it is enough to study , by some combinatorial arguments , the lcs of @xmath14 with an extra structure ( referred to as an ordered arrangement ) . </S>",
    "<S> although this part is explained in  ( * ? ? ? * section 3 ) , computations are hard to verify . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> [ r2 ] the second step is essentially combinatorial . </S>",
    "<S> the main point is to truncate the lcs of @xmath15 such that the quotient @xmath16 depends only on the combinatorics . </S>",
    "<S> rybnikov proposes to prove that an automorphism of @xmath16 induces the identity on @xmath11 ( up to sign and automorphisms of the combinatorics ) . </S>",
    "<S> this proof is only outlined in  ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * proposition 4.2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth pointing out that such a result can not be expected for any arrangement . </S>",
    "<S> also  ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * proposition 4.3 ) needs some explanation of its own . </S>",
    "<S> the main difference between relative topology and topology of the complement in terms of isomorphisms of the fundamental group is that homeomorphisms of pairs induce isomorphisms that send meridians to meridians , whereas homeomorphisms of the complement can induce any kind of isomorphism , and even if we know that the isomorphism induces the identity on homology , this is not enough to claim that meridians are sent to meridians .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of our work is to follow the idea behind rybnikov s work and , using slightly different techniques , provide detailed proofs of his result . </S>",
    "<S> this is part of a more general project by the authors that aims to better understand the relationship between topology and combinatorics of line arrangements .    </S>",
    "<S> the following is a more detailed description of the layout of this paper . in section  [ sec - defs ] , </S>",
    "<S> the more relevant definitions are set , as well as a description of rybnikov s and maclane s combinatorics . </S>",
    "<S> sections  [ sec - alex ]  and  [ sec - method ] provide a proof of step  ( r[r1 ] ) . in order to do so </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a new approach related to derived series , which is also useful in the study of characteristic varieties and the alexander invariant . </S>",
    "<S> the alexander invariant of a group @xmath17 , with a fixed isomorphism @xmath18 , is the quotient @xmath19 considered as a module over the ring @xmath20 $ ] , which is the group algebra of @xmath21 . by fixing an ideal @xmath22 , the truncated module by @xmath23 </S>",
    "<S> is studied . </S>",
    "<S> the problem is reduced to solving a system of linear equations .    </S>",
    "<S> section  [ sec - combinat ] is devoted to the study of combinatorial properties of a line arrangement which ensure that any automorphism of the fundamental group of the complement _ essentially _ induces the identity on homology ( that is , the analogous of  ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * proposition 4.2 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is an interesting question that can be applied to general line arrangements . for the sake of simplicity , </S>",
    "<S> we only present our progress on line arrangements with double and triple points . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a proof for the second step  ( r[r2 ] ) . </S>"
