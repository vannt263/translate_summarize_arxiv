    "finally , we examine `` metallic '' chiral swnts .",
    "the same discussion for the `` metallic '' zigzag swnts can be applied to `` metallic '' chiral swnts . however , there is a complication specific to chiral swnts that the phonon eigenvector depends on the chiral angle .",
    "@xcite reported that , for a chiral nanotube , the atoms vibrate along the direction of the carbon - carbon bonds and not along the axis or the circumference .",
    "the phonon eigenvector of a chiral nanotube may be written as @xmath409 where @xmath410 ( @xmath411 ) is in the direction around ( along ) a chiral tube axis , and @xmath412 is the angle difference between the axis and the vibration .",
    "this modifies eq .",
    "( [ eq : coupling ] ) as @xmath413 the identification of @xmath412 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : coupling_chi ] ) as a function of chirality would be useful to compare theoretical results and experiments , which will be explored in the future [ see @xcite for example ] .      in the case of 2d graphene , eq .",
    "( [ eq : coupling ] ) tells us that the @xmath0 point to and lo modes give the same energy shift because the integral over @xmath351 gives the same self - energy in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pi ] ) for both to and lo modes .",
    "this explains why no @xmath1-band splitting is observed in a single layer of graphene [ @xcite ] .",
    "even when we consider the to and lo modes not exactly at the @xmath0 point , we do not expect any splitting between the lo and to phonon energies since the to mode with @xmath294 is completely decoupled from the electrons [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : grapheneto ] ) ] .",
    "thus , for @xmath294 , only the lo mode contributes to the @xmath1 band intensity .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath0 point lo and to modes may exhibit anomalous behavior near the edge of graphene because the wave function is not given by a plane wave but rather by a standing wave .",
    "the pseudospin for the standing wave is different from that for a plane wave .",
    "moreover , the standing wave near the zigzag edge is different from that near the armchair edge , which gives rise to a selection rule in their raman spectra [ @xcite ] .",
    "the standing wave behavior near the edges in graphene ribbons is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we have seen that the curvature - induced gap is absent for armchair swnts , so that here the lo mode exhibits a strong kohn anomaly effect .",
    "recently , however , it has been reported that even armchair swnts have an energy gap originating from a correlation effect [ @xcite ] .",
    "the correlation - induced gap observed is approximately 80 mev for armchair swnt with @xmath414 nm , and the gap increases with decreasing @xmath8 .",
    "since the presence of a gap suppresses the contribution to the hardening , a local maximum ( around @xmath406 ) in the lo frequency vs. @xmath9 plot [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : arm ] ] may disappear , and @xmath406 would become a global minimum if the correlation gap exceeds 200mev . confirming",
    "this behavior in a raman spectroscopy study may provide further evidence for the correlation - induced gap .",
    "finally , we discuss our results in relation to the experimental results of the kohn anomaly for the rbms in metallic swnts [ @xcite ] .",
    "the frequency shifts observed are approximately 2cm@xmath400 , which is smaller than the theoretical value for a @xmath53 zigzag swnt , 8cm@xmath400 , shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : zig](b ) .",
    "this discrepancy may be attributed to the choice of the off - site el - ph matrix element , @xmath275 , although we have determined this value from density functional calculation . indeed , by",
    "decreasing the value of @xmath275 from @xmath277 ev / we find a better agreement to the experimental result , 3cm@xmath400 when @xmath416 ev /  .",
    "another possibility is that we have used a harmonic oscillator model for obtaining the magnitude of displacement vector @xmath417 .",
    "actual value of @xmath417 may be smaller than our estimation , which also gives a better agreement to the experimental result .    in summary ,",
    "the el - ph interaction with respect to the lo , to , and rbm for the raman feature for swnts is derived in a unified way using the deformation - induced gauge field .",
    "then , we have shown that the matrix element for electron - hole pair creation depends on the position of the cutting line . as a result ,",
    "the to mode in `` metallic '' swnts , except for armchair swnts , can couple to an electron - hole pair due to the curvature effect which shifts the cutting line away from the k point .",
    "in particular , only the low energy electron - hole pairs can couple to the to mode and give rise to a hardening of the to mode .",
    "the hardening of the to mode is suppressed for large diameter swnts .",
    "this is reasonable since the to mode as well as the lo mode exhibit a softening in the case of graphene samples .",
