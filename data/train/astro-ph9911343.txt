    "systems producing absorption in the spectra of distant quasars offer an excellent probe of the early universe . at high redshifts , they easily outnumber other observed tracers of cosmic structure , including both normal and active galaxies .",
    "the interpretation of low column density quasar absorption systems has undergone somewhat of a revolution during the past several years , with the recognition that they may consist of gas aggregating into mildly nonlinear structures analogous in their dynamical structure to today s galaxy superclusters @xcite . however , damped ly@xmath0  ( ) absorbers , with neutral hydrogen column densities @xmath22 , are usually thought to be associated with the dense interstellar gas of high - redshift galaxies , based on several lines of circumstantial evidence : similarity between the column densities of damped systems and the column densities through typical spiral disks today , rough agreement between the total mass of atomic hydrogen in damped absorbers at @xmath23 and the total mass of stars today @xcite , measurements of radial extents @xmath24 in two  systems @xcite , and direct imaging of a number of  hosts from ground based and hst observations @xcite . the nature of lyman limit ( ) absorbers , with @xmath25 , is less well understood , though most models associate them with the outer regions of galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "analytic studies based on the press - schechter ( 1974 ) formalism suggested that the abundance of  systems might be a strong test of cosmological models , potentially ruling out those models with little power on galaxy scales at @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the most sophisticated of these calculations , that of kauffmann ( 1996 ) , implied that the `` standard '' cold dark matter model ( scdm , with @xmath3 , @xmath26 , and a power spectrum normalization @xmath27 ) could account for the observed abundance of high - redshift dla systems , with about 30% of the absorption at @xmath28 occurring in galaxies with halo circular velocities @xmath29 .",
    "katz et al .",
    "( 1996 , hereafter kwhm ) presented the first predictions of the amount of  and  absorption based on 3-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations , concluding that these simulations of the scdm model came within a factor of two of matching the observed  abundance but fell nearly an order of magnitude short of reproducing observed absorption .",
    "ma et al .",
    "( 1997 ) `` calibrated ''  estimates from collisionless n - body simulations against the kwhm scdm simulations , then applied this calibration to n - body simulations of cold+hot dark matter ( chdm ) models .",
    "they concluded that the chdm scenario failed to reproduce the observed  abundance even with a neutrino fraction as low as @xmath30 , strengthening the earlier , analytic arguments , which focused on chdm with @xmath31 .",
    "quinn , katz , & efstathiou ( 1996 ; qke hereafter ) and thoul & weinberg ( 1996 ) find that halos with circular velocities @xmath32 are unlikely to harbor  absorbers .",
    "gas in halos below this limit does not collapse sufficiently to shield itself from the uv background and reach the necessary hi column densities .",
    "the shortcoming of the kwhm calculation was that it could not include the contribution from  and  systems below its resolution limit , corresponding to a halo circular velocity @xmath33 .",
    "consequently , the simulations themselves can only provide a lower limit to the total amount of  and  absorption in the universe . in gardner  ( 1997a ; gkhw hereafter ) , we addressed this shortcoming by combining the kwhm results with high resolution simulations of individual , low mass objects similar to those of qke .",
    "we used these simulations to obtain a relation between absorption cross - section @xmath0 and halo circular velocity @xmath11 , which we combined with the press - schechter halo abundance to compute the total  and  absorption in the scdm model .",
    "the correction for previously unresolved halos increased the predicted absorption by about a factor of two , bringing the predicted  abundance into good agreement with observations but leaving the predicted number of  systems substantially below the observed number . in gardner ( 1997b ; gkwh hereafter ) , we applied the @xmath17 relation derived for scdm to other cosmological models , obtaining more general predictions for  and  absorption under the assumption that the relation between halo @xmath11 and gas absorption cross - section was independent of cosmological parameters .    in this paper , we present results of simulations of several variants of the inflation+cdm scenario ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) and improve upon the gkwh results by using these simulations to predict  and  absorption in these models .",
    "we continue to use a press - schechter based extrapolation ( with the mass function of @xcite ) to compute the contribution of smaller halos to  and  statistics , employing an improved methodology that significantly changes the gkhw predictions for absorption by low mass systems . using an improved fitting procedure ,",
    "we obtain more accurate error estimates of our fitted @xmath17 to the simulated data .",
    "we find that our largest error in estimating the universal amount of  and absorption arises from the uncertainty in the exact @xmath11 at which halos cease to harbor these absorbers .",
    "given the large number of halos at @xmath34 , a small variation in the exact value or form of this cutoff leads to significant deviations in the estimation of total  and  absorption cross sections . in light of these results",
    ", we find that we are not yet able to test the four cosmologies we consider against the observed   and  abundances . instead",
    ", we have adopted the approach of determining the value of @xmath35 in each model that yields best agreement with the observations .",
    "the nature of the galaxies that host  systems has been a controversial topic for many years .",
    "two competing hypotheses have defined the poles of the debate : the idea that most  systems are large , rotating gas disks ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and the idea that a large fraction of  absorption arises in dwarf galaxies ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "the strongest empirical argument for the dwarf hypothesis is that some imaging studies reveal small galaxies near the line of sight but no clear candidates for large galaxies producing the absorption ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the recent study of two  systems at @xmath36 and @xmath37 by rao & turnshek ( 1998 ) and turnshek  ( 2000 ) places especially stringent upper limits on the luminosities of the host galaxies .",
    "the strongest argument for the rotating disk hypothesis is the analysis of metal - line kinematics in  systems by prochaska & wolfe ( 1997 , 1998 ) , who consider a variety of simplified models for the velocity structure of the absorbers and find that only a population of cold , rotating disks with typical circular velocities @xmath38 can account for the observed distribution of velocity spreads and for the high frequency of `` lopsided '' kinematic profiles . however , hierarchical models of galaxy formation predict that such massive disks should be rare at @xmath23 . in an important paper , haehnelt , steinmetz , & rauch ( 1998 )",
    "showed that hydrodynamic simulations of high - redshift galaxies could account for the lopsided kinematic profiles and large velocity spreads found by prochaska & wolfe ( 1997 , 1998 ) even with halo circular velocities substantially below @xmath39 , because of large scale asymmetries and departures from dynamical equilibrium ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this result makes the @xmath40 median halo circular velocities found by kauffmann ( 1996 ) and gkhw for the scdm model potentially compatible with the observed metal - line kinematics .",
    "our present simulations do not yet have enough resolution for us to repeat the haehnelt  ( 1998 ) analysis ; we hope to do so with future simulations to carry out a statistical comparison between results from a randomly chosen cosmological volume and the prochaska & wolfe ( 1997 , 1998 ) data . however , we can already extend the gkhw analysis to other cosmological models , predicting the fraction of  absorption arising in halos of different circular velocities .",
    "we also revisit an important issue explored by kwhm for the scdm model , the predicted distribution of projected separations between  and  systems and high - redshift galaxies . given the number of recent attempts to directly image  host galaxies , our predictions will be useful in testing the compatibility of the size and probable luminosity of our simulated  hosts with the imaging data .",

    "these were performed much more recently using ptreesph @xcite , a new parallelized version of treesph , and their details are also given in table  [ tab : params ] .",
    "l64 is the same mass resolution as ocdm and lcdm , while l128 is a factor of eight greater in mass resolution ( a factor of two greater spatially ) and is valuable in examining absorbers in the lower - mass halos that the five principal simulations can not resolve .",

    "for both simulation codes , dark matter , stars , and gas are all represented by particles ; collisionless material is influenced only by gravity , while gas is subject to gravitational forces , pressure gradients , and shocks .",

    "ionization and heat input from a uv radiation background are incorporated in the simulation .",
    "we adopt the uv background spectrum of haardt & madau ( 1996 ) , but reduce it in intensity by a factor of two at all redshifts so that the mean ly@xmath0  forest flux decrement is close to the observed value given our assumed baryon density @xcite .",
    "we apply small further adjustments to the background intensity during the analysis stage to precisely match the press , rybicki , & schneider ( 1993 ) measurements of the mean decrement ( see @xcite for further discussion of this procedure ) . for example , at @xmath9 , the background intensity is reduced to 20% of the haardt & madau value , first by 50% during the simulation , then by a further 40% during post - processing .",
    "if we adopted a higher baryon density , @xmath62 instead of @xmath63 , then the background intensity matching the observed mean decrement would be a factor @xmath64 higher .",

    "( 1999 ) .      from the simulation outputs at @xmath65 3 , and 2 , we identify dark matter halos and the individual concentrations of cold , collapsed gas that they contain .",
    "we initially identify the halos by applying a friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm to the combined distribution of dark matter and sph particles , with a linking length equal to the mean interparticle separation on an isodensity contour of an isothermal sphere with an enclosed average density contrast of @xmath66 .",
    "then , the position of the most bound particle in each fof - identified halo is passed on to the spherical density method ( so ; @xcite ) that calculates the sphere about the most bound particle that contains an overdensity of @xmath67 .",
    "the halos used in our analysis are those output from so , and the circular velocities , which we denote as @xmath11 , are the actual circular velocities at the @xmath67 radius ( @xmath68 ) of each halo .",

    "damped ly@xmath0  absorption , we apply the algorithm of stadel ( 2001 ; see also kwh and http://www-hpcc.astro.washington.edu/tools/skid ) to the distribution of cold gas and star particles .",
    "skid identifies gravitationally bound groups of particles that are associated with a common density maximum .",
    "gas particles are only considered as potential members of a skid group if they have a smoothed overdensity @xmath69 and temperature @xmath70 k , and we discard groups with fewer than four members ( we will apply a more stringent resolution cut below ) . all of the gas concentrations found by this method reside within a larger friends of friends halo , even at @xmath71 .",
    "we match each absorber with its parent ( so ) halo and discard halos that contain no absorbers . including or excluding the `` absorberless '' halos in our mass function does not change the results above our resolution cutoff ( explained below ) , since nearly all halos above our cutoff contain at least one absorber .",
    "we calculate the hi column densities for the halos by enclosing each halo within a sphere centered on the most tightly bound gas particle and of sufficient size to contain all the gas particles that might contribute to high column density absorption within the halo .",
    "we project the gas distribution within this sphere onto a uniform grid with a cell size of 5.43 comoving kpc , equal to the highest resolution achieved anywhere in the simulation , using the same spline kernel interpolation employed by the treesph  code for the hydrodynamics . for the l128 run",
    ", we use a pixel size of 2.715 as the peak spatial resolution is a factor of two better in each dimension than the other simulations .",
    "following kwhm , we calculate an initial hi column density for each grid point assuming that the gas is optically thin , then apply a self - shielding correction to yield a true hi column density ( see kwhm for details ) . for each halo",
    "we compute the projected area over which it produces damped absorption , with @xmath72 , and lyman limit absorption , with @xmath73 .",
    "for simplicity , we project all halos from a single direction , although we obtain a similar fit of absorption area to circular velocity ( see below ) if we project randomly in the @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 directions or average the projections in @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 . projecting a rectangular prism instead of a sphere yields the same results . to test for convergence , we reprojected several halos at 2 and 4 times smaller grid spacings and found that the cross section for  and  absorption changed by less than 1% in the majority of cases and by at most 2.5% .",
    "our five principal simulations , which each contain @xmath56 gas and @xmath56 dark matter particles , lack the dynamic range needed to model simultaneously the full mass range of objects that can contribute to  and  absorption . simulations by qke and gkhw show that halos with circular velocities as low as @xmath77 can host dla absorbers , while photoionized gas is unable to collapse and cool in smaller halos . however , if we adopted a particle mass low enough to resolve @xmath77 halos while retaining the same particle number , then our simulation volume would be too small to include a representative sample of more massive halos .    in our analysis of the simulation results",
    ", we find that halos consisting of at least 60 dark matter particles nearly always ( more than 98% of the time ) contain a cold , dense gas concentration .",
    "below this threshold , however , a substantial fraction of halos have no cold gas concentration . furthermore , in our bootstrap analysis of the variance in the relation between halo @xmath11 and absorption cross - section , described in  [ ssec : resmeth ] below , we find much larger scatter about the mean relation for halos with fewer than 60 dark matter particles than for halos with more than 60 dark matter particles .    to safeguard against additional systematic effects near the resolution boundary , we compare the high - resolution l128 run to l64 .",
    "we find that the mass cut of @xmath78 also allows the l64 halo properties to match smoothly with same mass halos in l128 .",
    "near perfect agreement for s ( figure  [ fig : val128l64 ] and later discussion ) is found with a mass corresponding to 70 particles .",
    "so to be as conservative as possible , we adopt @xmath79 as an estimate of the limiting mass below which we can not accurately compute the amount of absorption in a simulated halo . the 70 particle criterion is more conservative than the 34 particle criterion that we adopted in gkhw , and this change will affect our predictions for absorption in lower mass halos in  [ sec : lowmasshalos ] below .    applying this same mass cut to the l128 run , we find the limiting resolution to be roughly @xmath80 at @xmath9 , which is unfortunately still above the mass at which halos cease to host and  absorption .",
    "consequently , even the increased dynamic range of l128 does not allow us to model all absorbers .    in the critical density models ,",
    "the mass resolution limit is @xmath81 , corresponding to a circular velocity at the virial radius of @xmath82 , 160 , and @xmath83 at @xmath7 , 3 , and 4 , respectively . in the subcritical models , @xmath84 , corresponding to @xmath85 , 100 , and @xmath86 at @xmath87 3 , 4 . in l128 ,",
    "the mass resolution is a factor of eight better , hence @xmath88 and @xmath89 at @xmath9 . for our statistical analyses of the simulation results below",
    ", we always eliminate absorbers in halos whose total mass ( dark matter plus baryons , with the spherical overdensity mass definition given above ) is @xmath90 .",
    "our quoted results apply only to halos above the resolution limit . in  [ sec : lowmasshalos ] we attempt to compute , as a function of @xmath11 , the contribution of halos with @xmath90 to the total amount of and  absorption by combining the jenkins et al .",
    "( 2001 ) mass function with our numerical results .",
    "we assume throughout our subsequent analysis and discussion that our results for absorption in halos with @xmath91 are only minimally influenced by the residual effects of finite numerical resolution . we give evidence in  [ sec : lowmasshalos ] from the l128 run that the five principal runs are not influenced by resolution effects within a factor of 10 of their resolution cutoff .",
    "however , real absorption systems could have substructure that produces large fluctuations in hi column density on scales far below resolution limit of even our highest resolution simulation . in this scenario",
    ", the total amount of neutral gas in absorption systems would not be very different from our predictions , except to the extent that clumping shifts gas above or below the /  column density thresholds , but the distribution of column densities above the thresholds could be quite different .",
    "this issue will be difficult to address by direct numerical simulation alone because of the large range of scales involved . however , good agreement between predicted and observed column density distributions would support the contention that the absorbers do not have a great deal of substructure on scales below the simulation resolution limits .",
    "kwhm find good agreement between the predicted and observed shape of the column density distribution in the  regime , but a compelling case along these lines will require simulations that do resolve the full mass range of objects responsible for damped absorption , and which accurately resolve the low - end cutoff where halos cease to contain such absorption .",

    "we have removed tcdm from the analysis in this section due to the extreme paucity of structure in the model . for the remaining four models ,",
    "we calculate the total area subtended by absorption in the halos with skid - identified groups . comparing this value to the total area subtended in an entire volume projection of each simulation at redshifts @xmath7 and @xmath71 , we find agreement within 4.5% for all the models at both redshifts , and to better than 2% in five of the eight cases .",
    "we attribute the remaining differences to having more than one absorber along a given line of sight .",
    "hence , all  absorption in the simulation occurs within halos with at least one concentration of cold , gravitationally - bound gas .    in  absorption , five of the eight outputs",
    "agree to better than 6% when compared in this manner .",
    "however , at @xmath71 the results of volume projection and halo projection differed by 15% , 30% , and 13% for scdm , ccdm , and ocdm respectively .",
    "we took the worst case , @xmath71 ccdm , and projected all the halos that contained at least 32 particles ( gas @xmath121 dark matter ) , whether or not they contained a skid - identified gas concentration .",
    "when we sum the area subtended by  absorption in these halos , we find that it now accounts for all but 1.2% of the  absorption found by projecting the entire volume .",
    "hence lyman limit absorption still occurs exclusively in halos , but in this instance 30% of it occurs in halos in which our resolution of gas dynamics and cooling is only marginal and in which there are no skid - identified gas concentrations .",
    "if our study had higher resolution , it is likely that some of these halos would have been able to form  systems as well .",
    "however , it is just to correct for these unresolved or under - resolved halos that we developed our press - schechter correction technique .",
    "the important conclusion is that all the lyman limit absorption we find in the simulations resides within dark matter halos .",
    "if lyman limit absorption were to occur outside galactic halos , it would have to be in regions that are much too small for us to resolve .",
    "to summarize , all  and  absorption in our simulations occurs in dynamically bound dark matter halos , even below our resolution cutoff . at @xmath7 and @xmath71 , in all four of the models tested ,  absorption arises entirely in objects identified by skid as bound concentrations of cold gas .",
    "absorption in the simulations also occurs exclusively in dark matter halos , although at @xmath71 some of the gas within these halos is able to reach  column densities without becoming a skid - identified concentration .",
    "we have so far focused on  and  absorption in halos above our simulation mass resolution limits @xmath47 .",
    "however , if we want to test cosmological models against the observed incidence @xmath92 , we must also consider the absorption that arises in lower mass halos , which are smaller in cross section but much more numerous .",
    "the l128 run is a factor of eight finer in mass resolution than the other simulations in this study , allowing us to examine trends in  and  systems to lower masses .",
    "figure  [ fig : val128 ] compares , at @xmath9 , the circular velocity at @xmath68 of the halos in l128 with the cross section subtended by  absorption ( left panel ) and absorption ( right panel ) when the halo is projected .",
    "the number of vertices on each point indicates the number of skid - identified concentrations of cold collapsed gas within the halo .",
    "we can see that the absorption characteristics of galactic halos are not well approximated by assuming a single galaxy per halo . instead , the correlation of absorption cross section @xmath122 with halo mass seems to arise not from a single galaxy in each halo becoming larger as its parent halos increases in mass , but rather from more massive halos harboring more galaxies .",
    "consequently , the multiple - absorber nature of halos is extremely important in modeling the connection between halo mass and absorption cross section . to approach the problem semi - analytically",
    ", it is necessary to model the full interaction history of the halos , as is done in maller et al .",
    "the absorption cross sections of the individual galaxies is virtually independent of halo mass .",
    "if any trend exists , it appears that @xmath122 in halos containing only one galaxy may actually decrease slightly in more massive halos .",
    "higher mass halos have deeper potential wells , causing the concentrations of cold gas to contract more efficiently .",
    "this complex gas dynamical behavior demonstrates the value of a fully numerical treatment in modeling these objects .",
    "the dashed lines in figure  [ fig : val128 ] show the area subtended by a face - on disk of radius @xmath123 where @xmath14 is the virial radius of an isothermal sphere with circular velocity @xmath11 at the virial radius .",
    "10% of the virial radius is the typical extent of a galaxy based on centrifugal arguments .",
    "the solid line in figure  [ fig : val128 ] left ( ) panel shows the area subtended by a face - on disk of radius @xmath124 , while in the right panel it denotes area @xmath125 .",
    "although the solid lines were not fit to the data , one can see that the general trend of  and absorption is that the cross - section is roughly described as proportional to @xmath126 and @xmath127 respectively .",
    "we would like to be able to extrapolate the contribution to the total incidence by halos with @xmath128 . given the results from section [ ssec : resmeth ] , it is plausible to assume a power law fitting function @xmath129",
    ". qke find that a photoionizing background suppresses the collapse and cooling of gas in halos with circular velocities @xmath130 .",
    "thoul & weinberg ( 1996 ) find a similar cutoff in simulations that are much higher resolution but assume spherical symmetry .",
    "as discussed in  [ ssec : simulation ] , @xmath93 is approximately @xmath131  in the critical models and @xmath132  in the subcritical models at @xmath7 for the five principal runs . in l128 , which has a resolution limit of @xmath133",
    ", we find no evidence of a photoionization cutoff ; simulations with better mass resolution are required to detect it . for the @xmath17 dependence",
    "we find for resolved halos in our simulations , low mass halos dominate the total cross - section for   and  absorption .",
    "therefore , the predicted incidence @xmath92 depends sensitively on the assumed value of @xmath35 .",
    "since we can not robustly predict @xmath92 without exact knowledge of @xmath35 , we adopt the less ambitious goal of determining , for each cosmological model , what value of @xmath35 yields a good match to the observed values of @xmath92 .",
    "our approach to this calculation is similar to that of gkhw : we use our numerical simulations to calibrate a fit to the mean cross section for  ( or ) absorption of halos with circular velocity @xmath11 at redshift @xmath76 , then integrate over an analytic halo mass function to compute @xmath92 .",
    "figure  [ fig : val128l64 ] compares @xmath17 in the l128 and l64 simulations at redshift @xmath9 .",
    "figure  [ fig : nzplotsim ] compares the cumulative incidence @xmath134 , the total incidence from absorbers in halos at least at massive as @xmath11 , in l128 and l64 .",
    "note that in this figure , the incidence is measured directly from the simulations and not by convolving an analytic mass function with @xmath135 as is done later in this section .",
    "the runs were performed using the same cosmology but a factor of eight different mass resolution . in the absence of systematic resolution effects that may exist above our cutoff @xmath93 , the data from the l64 simulations should smoothly overlap with l128 above the l64 @xmath93 value . for the  case , although l64 appears to have more low - mass outliers than l128 , the simulations agree quite well both in @xmath17 and incidence . in the  case , however , we find that the we systematically underestimate the absorption cross section of absorbers in l64 by roughly 25% .",
    "this leads to the cumulative incidence of the l64 simulation also being 25% less than the same @xmath11 in l128 .",
    "therefore , at the l64 resolution we are not resolving all  absorption regions that exist inside halos with @xmath136 .",
    "one possibility is that areas whose average hi column density is slightly below the  cutoff ( @xmath137 ) on @xmath138 kpc scales have smaller , patchy clumps with higher column density .",
    "hence , the lower resolution simulations would systematically underestimate the  absoption in these regions . for  absorption , however , we detect no signatures of numerical resolution artifacts .    to find the best fitting function for absorption cross section , we bin halos in 0.05 dex increments in @xmath139 , beginning with @xmath140 and subject to the constraint that there be at least 10 halos in each bin .",
    "we sometimes are forced to widen the bin size to satisfy the latter constraint .",
    "let @xmath141 denote the `` cross section '' of  absorption , i.e. the comoving area subtended by hi column densities @xmath142 when a halo is projected onto a plane .",
    "for the binned distribution of halos , we determine the log of the average halo  absorption cross section , @xmath143 for each bin .",
    "then we calculate the statistical uncertainty of @xmath143 in each bin by using the bootstrap method with 1000 random realizations of the data set of halos with @xmath144 .",
    "the distribution of halo cross sections @xmath145 at a given @xmath11 is approximately log - normal and hence best described by a gaussian in log space .",
    "since we will use the bootstrap errors in the next section to calculate confidence limits , which assume gaussianity , we express the errors in log space .",
    "we fit the points @xmath146 by linear least squares to determine the parameters @xmath147 and @xmath148 , the amplitude and index for the power law fitting function @xmath149 .",
    "the error crosses in figure  [ fig : val128l64 ] show the mean absorption cross section in each bin of circular velocity at redshifts @xmath9 for  and systems .",
    "the horizontal error bars show the width of each bin , and the vertical error bars show the @xmath150 logarithmic uncertainty in @xmath151 for the bin determined by the bootstrap procedure .",
    "the solid error crosses are for l128 data and dashed error crosses for l64 .",
    "the solid and dashed lines denotes the best fit to the l128 and l64 data respectively . for  systems ,",
    "the fit to the l64 data is nearly identical to the l128 fit , showing that data at the resolution of the principal runs can be used reliably to estimate the absorption cross section below their resolution cutoff .",
    "the fit is systematically lower , reflecting the mismatch between l128 and l64 halo absorption .",
    "however , the two lines parallel each other meaning that the fitting procedure is robust and allows an accurate extrapolation to lower halo masses .",
    "it is important to note that we are not seeking to model the _ distribution _ of absorption cross sections in each bin , but only to characterize the _",
    "mean _ cross section in each bin so that the total absorption can be accurately reconstructed from equation  ( [ eq : nofzm ] ) below .",
    "the large spread and asymmetry in the distribution of absorption cross sections for individual halos is inconsequential for our purposes : @xmath152 is the number which , when multiplied by the halo number density at @xmath11 , yields the total absorption at that @xmath11 that matches the total absorption present in the simulation . the bootstrap technique yields a robust estimate of the statistical uncertainty in this mean cross section caused by the finite number of halos in the simulation . although the spread in absorption cross sections of individual halos may be large , their average absorption is a well determined quantity .",
    "figure  [ fig : fitplots ] shows the fitted relation @xmath135 for each of 4 cosmologies and redshifts @xmath118 .",
    "again we have removed tcdm from the analysis in this section due to the extreme paucity of structure in the model .",
    "given so few halos above the mass limit , we felt it useless to attempt to fit to the data .",
    "the values of the fit parameters are detailed in table  [ tab : fits ] . at @xmath71 ,",
    "the fits for each model tend to follow the same slope ( the exception being  scdm ) . at later redshifts",
    ", @xmath135 evolves differently for different models . in general , lcdm tends to be among the steepest in all cosmologies .",
    "interestingly , this steepness is not paralleled by ocdm at @xmath7 where the cross - sections of the more massive halos in ocdm have decreased markedly .",
    "ccdm tends to be flatter than scdm  the increased amplitude of structure apparently results in halos having smaller gas cross - sections .",
    "it is difficult to draw any general conclusions about the behavior of high column density absorbers in critical models vs. subcritical models , except that lcdm tends to have the highest cross - sections in massive halos .",

    "it is possible that  absorbers could reside in halos of lower mass than s.    the results show that although halos in models like lcdm generally have higher absorption cross sections , the increased number density of halos in the critical models tends to give them more total absorption than the subcritical models .",

    "higher resolution simulations are unlikely to change this conclusion , since clumping of the gas on scales below our gravitational softening length would tend to reduce the absorption cross section rather than increase it , unless this small scale clumping could produce neutral condensations in the outskirts of halos where we predict the gas to be mostly ionized .",
    "the evidence from l128 indicates that there are no resolution effects above @xmath93 that affect  systems , although estimates of  incidence in halos @xmath164 may be underestimated by 25% in the principal simulations .",
    "our models assume @xmath165 , and a higher baryon abundance ( e.g.  @xciteab ) might increase the predicted absorption .",
    "we have investigated scdm models with different @xmath45 values and find that higher @xmath45 leads to more absorption per halo as expected , but even a model with @xmath166 has too little absorption at this circular velocity threshold to match the observations .",
    "we will report further results from this study in a future paper .",
    "if any of these cosmological models is correct , then a substantial fraction of high redshift  absorption must arise in halos with @xmath167 .",
    "this conclusion appears consistent with the imaging of dla fields , which often reveals no large , bright galaxies near the line of sight @xcite .",
    "however , it implies that the asymmetric metal - line profiles found by prochaska & wolfe ( 1997 , 1998 ) must be interpreted as a signature of non - equilibrium dynamics @xcite rather than smooth rotation .",
    "we find a clear and intuitively sensible relationship between high hi column density absorption and the proximity to galaxies ( figure  [ fig : impacts ] )",
    ". damped systems typically lie within 10 - 15 kpc of the center of a host galaxy at @xmath168 , while lower column densities near the lyman limit regime typically occur farther from the host galaxy .",
    "all  and  absorption in our simulation occurs within collapsed dark matter halos . if it were to occur outside halos in the actual universe , it would have to be on size scales smaller than we resolve .",
    "the stellar mass in our simulation is generally a steep function of time in the redshift range @xmath169 , corresponding to a power law in @xmath76 ( figure  [ fig : omegaccg ] ) .",
    "the mass in cold collapsed gas , however , remains relatively fixed , indicating that the rate at which gas is converted into stars is roughly equal to the rate at which new gas cools out of ionized halos and condenses into galaxies .",
    "this result is expected if the star formation rate is an increasing function of gas density , as it is in our numerical formulation ( kwh ) .    in the first 3-d hydrodynamic study of high column density absorption",
    ", kwhm found that the predictions of @xmath92 from their simulations of the scdm model fell a factor of two short of the observed abundance but a factor of ten short of the observed  abundance .",
    "they speculated that the  shortfall could be made up by absorption in lower mass halos but that the  shortfall might imply a distinct physical mechanism for the formation of systems , such as thermal instability on mass scales far below the simulation s resolution limits @xcite .",
    "it appears , however , that for the resolution of the kwhm runs and the principal simulations presented here ,  absorption at simulation scales may not have converged . if the resolution is increased by a factor of eight ( as in the l128 run ) ,  absorption in halos over the same range in mass increases by 33%",
    "this suggests the possibility that standard cosmological models can explain the observed  systems with the physical processes that already occur in these simulations , albeit in halos somewhat below our current resolution limits .",
    "thus  and  absorption are closely related rather than physically distinct phenomena , with  absorption arising preferentially at larger galactocentric distances and in less massive halos .",
    "we find no evidence in the simulations of  absorption outside of galaxy dark matter halos .      in our simulations , the halo absorption cross sections @xmath170 are determined by complex and competing physical processes .",
    "if we consider only halos that contain a single gas concentration , then the absorption cross section can actually decrease slightly with increasing circular velocity ( solid points in figure  [ fig : val128l64 ] ) .",
    "however , more massive halos are more likely to contain multiple gas concentrations , with the net effect that @xmath170 increases with increasing @xmath11 . at @xmath7 ,",
    "the model with the weakest mass fluctuations ( lcdm ) tends to have high @xmath17 ( figure  [ fig : nzplots ] ) .",
    "this fact , and the trend for single - absorber halos , imply that  and  absorption cross sections are substantially affected by non - equilibrium dynamics : absorbers get smaller if they have time to cool and condense in a quiescent dark matter potential well .",
    "although others have argued that this behavior may be a numerical artifact ( @xcite ) , the agreement between our l64 and l128 runs and the appearance of the same trend in l128 suggests that it is not .",
    "consequently , we suspect that this non - equilibrium behavior is a real feature of  and  systems , possibly the geometric counterpart to the complex kinematic behavior found by haehnelt et al .",
    "the physical complexity of @xmath170 implies that an accurate fully analytic description of high column density absorption in cdm models will be difficult to achieve .",
    "even the simple expectation that more small scale power produces a higher incidence of  and  absorption does not always hold .    in the l64 and l128 runs , for which  results agree well in the mass regime of overlap , the mean cross - section for  absorption is @xmath171 , much larger than the simple estimate @xmath172 based on collapse of the baryons to a centrifugally supported disk . for  absorption , where we find that absorption in equal - mass halos is 25% lower in l64 than in l128 ( which has a factor of eight finer mass resolution ) ,",
    "the cross sections in l128 are described by @xmath173 .    to estimate the amount of absorption in halos below the resolution limits of our simulations",
    ", we adopted a procedure similar to that of gkhw , using the numerical results to calibrate @xmath170 and the jenkins et al .",
    "( 2001 ) mass function to compute the halo abundance",
    ". however , relative to gkhw we employed a much more conservative estimate of @xmath93 and an improved error estimation procedure based on bootstrap analysis instead of poisson errors .",
    "these changes lead to superior @xmath170 fits that generally increase the predicted amount of absorption in halos with @xmath174 .",
    "our new results for @xmath92 in the scdm model supersede those of gkhw , since our new procedures are certainly an improvement , and our results for @xmath92 in other models supersede those of gkwh , since in addition to these technical improvements we now have numerical simulations of these other models to constrain @xmath170 for @xmath110 .",
    "the bootstrap procedure yields believable statistical uncertainties in the @xmath134 predictions .    taking our results and error estimates at face value , we find that four of the cosmological models that we consider are compatible with observational estimates of the incidence of  and  absorption at @xmath87 3 , and 4 .",
    "what hinders us in better quantifying the total incidence in the universe is our uncertainly in the estimate of the @xmath35 , the circular velocity at which halos cease to harbor high column density systems .",
    "previous studies ( qke ; @xcite ) have found this cutoff to be approximately 40 . however , due to the extreme number density of halos at this mass , a slight uncertainty in this cutoff results in huge uncertainties in estimating the total incidence in  and systems .",
    "instead we determine , for each cosmology , the value of @xmath35 that best matches @xmath92 observations .",
    "reproducing the data of @xcite and @xcite requires @xmath175 for  systems and @xmath159 for  systems , with some dependence on cosmology and redshift ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : nzplots ] ) .    since the  values of @xmath35 are above the expected threshold caused by photoionization , there is some risk that all of these models would predict _ too much _",
    "absorption in simulations that fully resolved the population of absorbing systems . a model with somewhat less small scale power , such as",
    "the lower amplitude lcdm model favored by recent ly@xmath0 forest studies @xcite , might fare better in this regard , perhaps matching the observed  abundance with a @xmath35 closer to the expected photoionization value .",
    "we are unable to make predictions for total absorption in the tcdm model with our current simulations because the paucity of structure above our resolution threshold makes our extrapolation procedure unreliable .",
    "our current simulations provide a number of insights into the physics of  and  absorption in halos with @xmath176 .",
    "unfortunately , they also imply that robust numerical predictions of the incidence of high - redshift  and  absorption will require simulations that resolve gas dynamics and cooling in halos with @xmath177 , where our analytic modeling predicts a large fraction of the high column density absorption to occur .",
    "simulations that resolve such halos exist ( e.g.  qke ; @xcite ) , but they do not yet model large enough volumes to predict statistical quantities like @xmath92 . achieving the necessary combination of resolution and volume is challenging but within reach of current computational techniques .",

    "<S> we find a clear relation between hi column density and projected distance to the center of the nearest galaxy , with  absorption usually confined to galactocentric radii less than @xmath10 kpc and  absorption arising out to projected separations of 30 kpc or more . if we consider only absorption in the halos resolved by our standard simulations , then all five models fall short of reproducing the observed abundance of  and  systems at these redshifts . to estimate the absorption from lower mass halos , we fit a power - law to the relation between absorption area @xmath0 and halo circular velocity @xmath11 in our simulations and extrapolate using the jenkins et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2001 ) halo mass function ; we do not apply this method to the tcdm model because it has too few halos at the level resolved by our simulation . </S>",
    "<S> in the two lcdm simulations , for which  results agree well in the mass regime of overlap , the mean cross - section for  absorption is @xmath12 , much larger than the simple estimate @xmath13 based on collapse of the baryons to a centrifugally supported disk ( @xmath14 is the halo virial radius ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cross sections for  absorption are @xmath15 , with a dependence on numerical resolution at the @xmath16 level . </S>",
    "<S> detailed examination provides further evidence of non - equilibrium effects on absorption cross - section : for example , individual absorbers can be slightly smaller in more massive halos because gas sinks deeper into the potential wells , but more massive halos nonetheless have larger average cross - sections because they are more likely to have multiple gas concentrations . </S>",
    "<S> our extrapolation procedure implies that all four models are consistent with the observed abundance of  systems if the fitted @xmath17 extends to @xmath18 , and they may produce too much absorption if the relation continues to @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> matching the observed abundance of  systems requires absorption in halos down to @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that  absorption is closely akin to absorption , arising in less massive halos or at larger galactocentric radii but not caused by processes acting on a radically different mass scale . </S>",
    "<S> robust tests of cosmological models against the observed amount of high column density absorption will require simulations of representative volumes that resolve halos at the low - mass limit where they cease to harbor high column density absorbers , @xmath21 . </S>"
