    "the strip supports the propagation of extremely - confined transverse - magnetic ( tm ) plasmons @xcite whose guiding characteristics can be dynamically modified along the structure by applying different dc bias voltages to the gating pads . if all pads are equally biased , the structure behaves as a simple plasmonic transmission line ( tl ) propagating the input waves towards the output port .",

    "smaller values of @xmath25 result in a wider spurious - free range , while requiring more abrupt changes in the line impedances .",

    "the properties and dispersion relation of these plasmons have been studied by several authors @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the desired dispersion relation does not admit an analytical solution and one has to resort to full - wave numerical techniques .",
    "consequently , the use of a transmission line model would generally require the numerical analysis of the propagating modes along multiple isolated graphene strips of varying characteristics , which remains a computationally costly task .",
    "this shortcoming , however , can be elegantly overcome by making use of the quasi - electrostatic nature of surface plasmons in narrow graphene strips , enabling an extremely efficient design and analysis tool . to this end ,",
    "the scaling law proposed in @xcite , based in the quasi - electrostatic nature of surface plasmons in graphene strips , will be used .",
    "this approach , which assumes that the strip width is much smaller than the wavelength , establishes that plasmon properties are solely determined by the strip width ( @xmath1 ) , surrounding media ( @xmath15 ) , and graphene conductivity ( @xmath3 ) .",
