    "the quasicontinuum ( qc ) method was introduced by tadmor , ortiz and phillips @xcite as a computational tool for atomistic simulations of crystalline solids at zero temperature .",
    "the key idea is to split the computational domain into regions where a very detailed ( atomistic , nonlocal ) description is needed and regions where a coarser ( continuum , local ) description is sufficient .",
    "the qc - method and improvements of it are successfully used to study crystal defects such as dislocations , nanoindentations or cracks and their impact on the overall behaviour of the material , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "there are various types of qc - methods : some are formulated in an energy based framework , some in a force based framework ; further , different couplings between the atomistic and continuum parts and different models in the continuum region are considered . in the previous decade , many articles related to the numerical analysis of such coupling methods were published .",
    "we refer to @xcite for recent overviews , in particular on the large literature including work on error analysis .    in this article , we consider a one - dimensional problem and focus on the so - called quasinonlocal quasicontinuum ( qnl ) method , first proposed in @xcite .",
    "the qnl - method and further generalizations of it ( see e.g.  @xcite ) are energy - based qc - methods and are constructed to overcome asymmetries ( so called ghost - forces ) at the atomistic / continuum interface which arise in the classical energy based qc - method .",
    "+ we are interested in an analytical approach in order to verify the qnl - method as an appropriate mechanical model by means of a discrete - to - continuum limit .",
    "this is embedded into the general aim of deriving continuum theories from atomistic models , see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.1 ) , where also the need of a rigorous justification of qc - methods is addressed .",
    "+ our approach , announced in @xcite , is based on @xmath0-convergence , which is a notion for the convergence of variational problems , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we start with a one - dimensional fully atomistic model problem which takes nearest and next - to - nearest neighbour interactions into account .",
    "the limiting behaviour of the corresponding discrete model was analyzed by means of @xmath0-convergence techniques in @xcite for a large number of atoms .",
    "in particular the @xmath0-limit and the first order @xmath0-limit are derived there , which take into account boundary layer effects .",
    "+ from the fully atomistic model problem , we construct an approximation based on the qnl - method . in particular , we keep the nearest and next - to - nearest neighbour interactions in the atomistic ( nonlocal ) region and approximate the next - to - nearest neighbour interactions in the continuum ( local ) region by certain nearest neighbour interactions as outlined below . furthermore , we reduce the degree of freedom of the energy by fixing certain representative atoms and let the deformation of all atoms depend only on the deformation of these representative atoms . + it turns out that the choice of the representative atoms has a considerable impact on the validity of the qc - method , see theorem  [ 5:cor ] , which is the main result of this work .",
    "this theorem asserts that the qc - method is valid if the representative atoms are chosen in such a way that there is at least one non - representative atom between two neighbouring representative atoms in the local region and in particular at the interface between the local and nonlocal regions . in proposition",
    "[ lemma : fracture ] , we prove that the mentioned sufficient condition on the choice of the representative atoms is indeed sharp by showing that in cases where the condition is not satisfied the limiting energy functional of the qc - method does not have the same minima as the limiting energy of the fully atomistic model and thus should not be considered an appropriate approximation .",
    "this implies by means of analytical tools that in numerical simulations of fracture one has to make sure to pick a sufficiently large mesh in the continuum region and at the interface .    the outline of this article is as follows . in section  2 we present the two discrete models , namely the fully atomistic and the quasicontinuum model , in detail . in sections  3 and 4",
    "we investigate the limiting behaviour of the quasicontinuum energy functional by deriving the @xmath0-limits of zeroth and first order .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath0-limit of zeroth order of the fully atomistic and the quasicontinuum model coincide ( theorem  [ theorem : zero ] ) .",
    "if the boundary conditions are such that the specimen behaves elastically , we prove that both models also have the same @xmath0-limit of first order ( theorem  [ theorem : elastic ] ) .",
    "+ if the boundary conditions are such that fracture occurs , the quasicontinuum approximation leads to a @xmath0-limit of first order ( theorem  [ theorem : fracture ] ) that is in general different from the one obtained earlier for the fully atomistic model ( @xcite , cf .",
    "theorem  [ th : fracturennn ] ) . to compare the fully atomistic and the quasicontinuum model also in this regime",
    ", we analyze the @xmath0-limits of first order further in section  5 .",
    "as mentioned above , it turns out that if we use a sufficiently coarse mesh in the continuum region , the minimal energies of the two first order @xmath0-limits coincide ( theorem  [ 5:cor ] ) .",
    "in fact we are able to show that in our particular model problem it is sufficient that the mesh size in the continuum region is at least twice the atomistic lattice distance . with this choice",
    ", fracture occurs always in the atomistic region as desired .",
    "+ furthermore , the @xmath0-convergence results imply , under suitable assumptions , a rate of convergence of the minimal energy of the quasicontinuum model to the minimal energy of the fully atomistic model ( theorem [ th : limmin ] ) .",
    "finally , we show that the condition on the mesh size is sharp . in proposition",
    "[ lemma : fracture ] , we provide examples where the corresponding @xmath0-limit has a different minimal energy and different minimizers than the fully atomistic system , which is due to poorly chosen meshes .",
    "this yields an analytical understanding of why meshes have to be chosen coarse enough in the continuum region .",
    "similar models as the one we consider here , were investigated previously in terms of numerical analysis .",
    "we refer especially to @xcite where the qnl method is studied in one dimension . by proving notions of consistency and stability ,",
    "those authors perform an error analysis in terms of the lattice spacing . to our knowledge ,",
    "most of the results do not hold for `` fractured '' deformations .",
    "however , in @xcite a galerkin approximation of a discrete system is considered and error bounds are proven also for states with a single crack of which the position is prescribed . recently , a different approach based on bifurcation theory is used in @xcite to study the qc - approximation in the context of crack growth . in @xcite ,",
    "a different one - dimensional atomistic - continuum coupling method is investigated .",
    "similar as in the qc - method the domain is splitted in a discrete and a continuum region . in the discrete part",
    "the energy is given by nearest neighbour lennard - jones interaction and in the continuum part by an integral functional with lennard - jones energy density .",
    "it is shown that fracture is more favourable in the continuum than in the discrete region . to overcome this , the energy density of the continuum model is modified by introducing an additional term which depends on the lattice distance in the discrete region",
    "furthermore , in @xcite it is remarked that if the continuum model is replaced by a typical discretized version , the fracture is favourable in the discrete region .",
    "as mentioned above , we here treat a similar issue in the qnl - method , see in particular theorem  [ 5:cor ] , proposition  [ lemma : fracture ] .",
    "the techniques of our analysis of the qnl method are related to earlier approaches based on @xmath0-convergence for the passage from discrete to continuum models in one dimension , see @xcite ; see also @xcite for a treatment of two dimensional models .",
    "recently , @xmath0-convergence was used in @xcite to study a qc approximation . in @xcite a different atomistic model , namely a harmonic and defect - free crystal ,",
    "is considered . under general conditions",
    "it is shown that a quasicontinuum approximation based on summation rules has the same continuum limit as the fully atomistic system .",
    "common in all those works based on @xmath0-convergence is that primarily information about the global minimum and minimizers are obtained . since atomistic solutions are not necessary global minimizers",
    ", it would be of interest to obtain also results for local minimizers , for instance in the lines of @xcite . in this article",
    ", we treat systems with nearest and next - to - nearest neighbour interaction .",
    "a natural question is how the sufficient conditions on the choice of representative atoms change if we consider also @xmath1 interacting neighbours , @xmath2 .",
    "therefore the corresponding fully atomistic model has first to be studied , which is part of ongoing research .",
    "first we describe our atomistic model problem which is the same as in @xcite .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional lattice given by @xmath3 $ ] with @xmath4 and interpret this as a chain of @xmath5 atoms .",
    "we denote by @xmath6\\to\\mathbb{r}$ ] the deformation of the atoms from the reference configuration and write @xmath7 as shorthand .",
    "we identify such functions with their piecewise affine interpolations and define @xmath8):u\\text { is affine on } ( i , i+1)\\lambda_n,~i\\in\\{0, ... ,n-1\\}\\right\\}.\\ ] ] the energy of a deformation @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are potentials of lennard - jones type which will be specified in [ lj1][lj4 ] below .",
    "moreover , we impose boundary conditions on the first and last two atoms . for given @xmath13 we set @xmath14 to consider only deformations which satisfy ( [ def : boundarycond ] )",
    ", we define the functional @xmath15 $ ] @xmath16 the goal is to solve the minimization problem @xmath17 which we consider as our atomistic problem .",
    "+ the idea of energy based quasicontinuum approximations is to replace the above minimization problem by a simpler one of which minimizers and minimal energies are good approximations of the ones for @xmath18 .",
    "typically this new problem is obtained in two steps :    * define an energy where the long range ( in our case next - to - nearest neighbour ) interactions are replaced by certain nearest neighbour interactions in some regions . *",
    "reduce the degree of freedom by choosing a smaller set of admissible functions .    to obtain ( a )",
    ", the next - to - nearest neighbour interactions are approximated as @xmath19 see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "while this approximation turns out to be appropriate in the bulk , this is not the case close to surfaces , where the second neighbour interactions create boundary layers .",
    "this motivates to construct a quasinonlocal quasicontinuum model accordingly : for given @xmath20 let @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "for @xmath23 we define the energy @xmath24 by using the above approximation for @xmath25 , cf .",

    "we use the fact that @xmath34 is constant on @xmath35 for @xmath36 and thus @xmath37 then @xmath38 for @xmath9 satisfying ( [ def : boundarycond ] ) .    [ fig : qcchain ]    to obtain ( b ) we consider instead of the deformation of all atoms just the deformation of a possibly much smaller set of so called representative atoms ( repatoms ) .",
    "we denote the set of repatoms by @xmath39 with @xmath40 and define @xmath41\\to\\mathbb{r}:u\\text { is affine on } ( t_n^i , t_n^{i+1})\\lambda_n\\mbox { for}~t_n^i,~t_n^{i+1}\\in\\t_n\\right\\}\\label{def : atn}.\\ ] ] since we are interested in the energy @xmath42 for deformations @xmath43 , we define @xmath44    in the following sections we study @xmath45 as @xmath46 tends to infinity .",
    "therefore , we will assume that @xmath23 is such that @xmath47 hence , in particular @xmath48 .",
    "the above assumption corresponds to the case that the size of the atomistic region becomes unbounded on a microscopic scale ( i ) , but shrinks to a point on a macroscopic scale ( ii ) .",
    "while assumption ( i ) is crucial , see also remark [ rem : elastic ] , the assumption ( ii ) can be easily replaced by @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in this case",
