    "hunting for the primordial non - gaussianity in cosmological observations has been a focus of attention as a big impact on the cosmology . in march 2013",
    ", planck collaboration has reported tight constraints on the non - linearity parameters which characterize the amplitude of the deviation from pure gaussian statistics @xcite .",
    "this result apparently implies that the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies measured by the planck mission are very close to gaussian , and may support the standard scenario of structure formation that the large - scale structure ( lss ) of the universe has emerged from tiny gaussian fluctuations .",
    "nevertheless , the constraints derived from lss observations is still limited ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and at least as a cross check of the cmb results , it is worthwhile to further investigate the validity of this hypothesis precisely and independently from the lss observations .",
    "it is recently known that large - scale halo / galaxy distributions that trace the lss provide a distinct information on the primordial non - gaussianity . in particular ,",
    "the scale dependence of halo / galaxy bias has been found to be a very powerful probe to search for a primordial non - gaussianity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the most striking feature of the scale - dependent bias is that the effect appears even in the halo / galaxy power spectrum , and drastically change its shape and amplitude on large scales .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the case of cmb observations , where the fluctuations are still in the linear regime , and hence the bispectrum and other higher - order statistics of the cmb anisotropies are the direct probe of primordial non - gaussianity .    in this paper , we are particularly interested in the halo / galaxy bispectrum .",
    "notice that the influence of scale - dependent bias also appears in the halo / galaxy bispectrum and other polyspectra .",
    "although the late - time gravitational evolution is known to induce the non - gaussianity which inevitably dominates the primordial non - gaussianity on small scales , a characteristic feature of the gravity - induced bispectrum basically differs from the one originating from the primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "further , due to the scale - dependent bias , the amplitude of halo / galaxy bispectrum may be enhanced , leading to a detectable signal on large scales ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , using the peak formalism and the local bias picture , the authors have derived the analytic expression for halo / galaxy bispectrum . on the other hand , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite make use of the peak - background split picture , and specifically studied the halo bispectrum in the presence of primordial local - type non - gaussianity , characterized by the two constant parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "numerical study on the halo bispectrum has been also made with cosmological @xmath2-body simulation ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "still , however , most of works has restricted their attention to the local - type non - gaussianity . with advent of high - precision lss observations such as des  @xcite , bigboss  @xcite , lsst  @xcite , euclid  @xcite , and hsc / pfs ( sumire )  @xcite , it is important to give a systematic study on the prediction of bispectrum for various types of primordial non - gaussianity .    in this paper",
    ", we systematically study the effect of the primordial non - gaussianity on the bispectrum of the halos / galaxies , on the basis of the integrated perturbation theory ( ipt )  @xcite , which helps us to systematically derive a precise formula to connect the halo / galaxy clustering with the initial matter density field  @xcite . with the ipt formalism",
    ", the non - local biasing effect can be incorporated into the statistical calculation of galaxies and halos in a straightforward manner .",
    "further , in deriviing the effect of the primordial non - gaussianity on the clustering of the halos , we do not need to introduce the peak - background split picture .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors have compared an analytic formula for the correlation function of the halos based on the ipt formalism with numerical @xmath2-body simulation and found the agreement of those results with a high precision .",
    "based on this formalism , we compute the halo bispectrum in the presence of local- , equilateral- , and orthogonal - type non - gaussianities .",
    "further , in case of the local - type non - gaussianity , we include the effect of the primordial trispectrum characterized by two non - linearity parameters , @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "while we mainly present the results of ipt calculation at one - loop order ( i.e. , next - to - leading order ) , the two - loop order ( i.e. , next - to - next - leading order ) contributions turns out to be important in several case .",

    "we discuss the comparison with the previous works where the bispectrum is obtained by other approaches and stress the utility of our systematic approach based on the ipt diagrammatic picture in section [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "we also investigate the dependences of the redshift and the mass of halos .",
    "we devote the final section to summary .",
    "we plot the figures of this paper with adopting the best fit cosmological parameters taken from wmap 9-year data  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we give the formula for the bispectrum of galaxies and halos , based on the integrated perturbation theory ( ipt ) . as we mentioned in the introduction , advantage of the integrated perturbation theory ( ipt )",
    "is that the effect of non - local biasing can be incorporated into the statistical calculation of galaxies and halos in a straightforward manner . ref .",
    "@xcite has shown that an analytic formula for the correlation function of the halos based on the ipt agrees with @xmath2-body simulations in a good accuracy .",
