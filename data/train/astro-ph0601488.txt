    "the configuration of our solar system is perhaps the most significant starting point for our understanding of planet formation .",
    "therefore a fundamental question is whether or not the architecture of our solar system is common relative to other planetary systems .",
    "one point of comparison is the structure of our kuiper belt relative to other systems , which are typically seen as debris disks in scattered light or thermal emission . in scattered light ,",
    "some debris disks , such as @xmath4 pic and au mic , have central holes , but are radially extended to hundreds of au radii @xcite .",
    "other debris disks , such as hr 4796a and fomalhaut consist of relatively narrow rings with sharp inner and outer boundaries @xcite .",
    "however , a narrow - belt architecture has not previously been detected in scattered light among stars similar in spectral type and age to the sun .",
    "hd 53143 ( k1v ) and hd 139664 ( f5v ) are two stars @xmath018 parsec from the sun known to have circumstellar dust due to excess thermal emission at far - infrared wavelengths ( aumann 1985 ; stencel & backman 1991 ; table 1 ) .",
    "various indicators place the age of hd 53143 at @xmath5 gyr @xcite , whereas hd 139664 may be a younger system with age @xmath6 gyr @xcite .",
    "for these two stars the infrared excess corresponds to a dust mass 3 - 10 times smaller than that of @xmath010 myr - old systems such as au mic and @xmath4 pic @xcite .",
    "direct imaging of debris disks with masses this small is observationally challenging , but it is now feasible using the optical coronagraph in acs .",
    "we utilized the hst acs high resolution camera ( hrc ) with a 1.8@xmath7 diameter occulting spot to artificially eclipse each star ( table 1 ; fig .",
    "five f stars were observed in consecutive orbits , as were five k stars , in order to minimize differences in the point spread function ( psf ) due to telescope thermal variations .",
    "each psf was subtracted using the four other stars in each set of observations .",
    "the relative intensity scaling and registration between images was iteratively adjusted until the residual image showed a mean radial profile equal to zero intensity .",
    "after the excess nebulosity was detected around hd 53143 and hd 139664 , we determined that no surface brightness asymmetries were detected between each side of each disk . to improve the signal - to - noise , we mirror averaged the data ( figs . 2 & 3 ) .",
    "mirror averaging splits the image into two halves along the axis that is perpendicular to the disk midplane and bisects the disk .",
    "one side is transposed onto the other side and the data are then averaged .",
    "asymmetries due to scattering phase function effects will be coadded @xcite . in effect",
    "mirror averaging doubles the integration time spent on the circumstellar disk given that the broad features between each side are symmetric . as a test",
    ", we also subtracted the two disk halves from each other and confirmed that the assumption of symmetry is valid .",
    "the two disks have different morphologies due to different inclinations and intrinsically different architectures . to quantify the viewing geometries and structural properties of the disks , we produce a series of simulated scattered - light disks that explore the parameters of inclination to the line of sight , inner and outer disk radius , and the radial and vertical variation of dust number density ( fig . 2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "we reinsert the simulated disks across each star in a direction orthogonal to the observed midplanes and select those models that most closely resemble the properties of the observed disks .",
    "table 1 summarizes our findings .",
    "the shape of the midplane surface brightness distribution differs significantly for each system ( fig .",
    "the hd 53143 midplane surface brightness decreases monotonically with projected radius , approximately as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the projected radius . in the simulated disk ,",
    "the radial number density distribution decreases as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is radius in the disk cylindrical coordinate system . our solar system",
    "s zodiacal dust complex has a comparable dependence of grain number density as a function of radius ( @xmath12 ; kelsall et al .",
    "1998 ) , controlled mainly by the force of poynting - robertson ( pr ) drag that causes small grains to spiral into the sun @xcite .",
    "therefore the hd 53143 disk may simply represent a population of unseen parent bodies that collisionally replenish dust that is redistributed radially by pr drag .",
    "our simulations show that the outer radius of the observed disk is a sensitivity - limited value at approximately 6@xmath7 radius ( 110 au ) .",
    "the inner radius is also sensitivity - limited to 3@xmath7 radius ( 55 au ) .",
    "therefore , the debris disk around hd 53143 is at least 55 au wide .",
    "material surrounding hd 139664 , on the other hand , is confined to a narrow belt , as indicated by a turnover in the midplane surface brightness profile between 4.5@xmath7 and 5.5@xmath7 ( 79 - 96 au ; fig .",
    "our disk simulations show that the peak in the dust distribution occurs at 83 au , decreasing as @xmath13 from 83 - 109 au , and with a sharp outer truncation at 109 au ( figs . 2 & 3 ) .",
    "we tested model disks that have outer radii @xmath2109 au and found that these disks would have been detectable in our data as far as 10@xmath7 radius ( 175 au ; fig .",
    "3 ) . given an absence of significant gas , the belt - like nature of hd 139664 is most likely a structure related to planet formation .",
    "@xcite find that a dust belt with peak surface brightness at @xmath080 au radius forms within a planetesimal disk at age 400 myr .",
    "the appearance of this belt signals the recent formation of a @xmath141000 km planet that gravitationally stirs planetesimals in its viscinity . @xcite and @xcite , on the other hand ,",
    "simulate the concentrations of dust in trans - neptunian space that arise due to trapping in mean motion resonances .",
    "a natural explanation for the belt - like morphology of hd 139664 is that the @xmath083 au peak in the dust distribution corresponds to either an interior or exterior mean motion resonance created by a companion to hd 139664 .",
    "large grains may dominate the belt s peak at 83 au , with smaller grains passing quickly through the resonance regions due to radiation forces .",
    "taking a census of eight debris disks resolved in scattered light and the predicted dust distribution in our kuiper belt , we observe two basic architectures that are not correlated with stellar mass and luminosity , but must depend on other environmental factors ( table 2 ) .",
    "debris systems are either narrow belts or wide disks .",
    "both types have central dust depletions , but the distinguishing characteristic is the presence or absence of a distinct outer edge .",
    "hr 4796a , fomalhaut , hd 139664 and the sun are examples of narrow - belt systems .",
    "the belt systems appear to have radial widths ranging between 20 and 30 au , and the inner edges may begin as close as 25 au ( sun ) , or as far as 133 au ( fomalhaut ) .",
    "hd 32297 , @xmath4 pic , hd 107146 , hd 53143 and au mic are examples of disks with sensitivity - limited outer edges that imply disk widths @xmath250 au .",
    "the f , g , and k stars are interesting because _ a priori _ we might expect to find planetary systems similar to our own , yet we discover significant diversity in the outer regions that correspond to neptune and our kuiper belt . with age",
    "@xmath01 gyr , hd 53143 is among the oldest known extrasolar debris disks , yet its wide - disk architecture resembles that of the @xmath010 myr old systems of @xmath4 pic and au mic .",
    "the lingering dust mass ( table 1 ) throughout the system could signal the absence of giant planets that otherwise sweep clear the parent bodies ( comets and asteroids ) responsible for the producing the dust disk . yet",
    "the presence of a dust disk out to at least 110 au radius shows that the primordial circumstellar disk probably contained the prerequisite mass of gas and dust to form giant planets .",
    "by contrast , the younger system hd 139664 has already developed a narrow - belt architecture .",
    "narrow - belt architectures for the underlying population of planetesimals may originate from early stochastic dynamical events , such as a close stellar flyby , that strip disk mass and dynamically heat the surviving disk @xcite .",
    "theoretical simulations show that a reduction in disk mass , combined with dynamical heating , produces a less stable planetary system that is more likely to eject giant planets from their formation site to much larger radii , as has been proposed for the origin of neptune @xcite",
    ". therefore , planetesimal belts not only evolve into a narrow structures because of external stochastic events , but they may be found at large distances from the central star due to the subsequent outward migration of interior planets .",
    "the collisionally replenished dust population will spread away from any narrow belt of planetesimals .",
    "if the scattered light appearance continues to manifest a narrow structure , then both the inner and outer edges are probably maintained by other gravitational perturbers such as stellar or sub - stellar companions .",
    "however , only hr 4796 has a known stellar companion that may truncate the outer radius of the dust belt @xcite .",
    "if there is no confinement mechanism for the outer radius , then the architecture will manifest as a wide - disk .",
    "for example , @xmath4 pic and au mic may have narrow belts of planetesimals @xcite , but the observed dust disk widths extend to hundreds of au . though the predicted structure of our kuiper belt places the solar system among the narrow disk architectures ,",
    "it is conceivable that the dust component extends to greater radii @xcite .",
    "thus the sun s classification as a narrow - disk system is tentative .",
    "we present the first optical scattered light images of debris disks surrounding relatively old main sequence f and k stars .",
    "material around hd 139664 is concentrated at 83 au radius , with a distinct outer edge at 109 au , and a depleted , but not empty , region at @xmath1583 au radius .",
    "dust surrounding hd 53143 has a monotonic @xmath10 variation in grain number density , and the disk edges from 55 au to 110 au are sensitivity - limited values .",
    "the different radial widths appear consistent with a more general grouping of debris disks into either narrow or wide architectures .",
    "these two categories are probably an oversimplification of significant diversity in the formation and evolution of debris disks .",
    "future observations should test for common traits among these stars , such as stellar multiplicity and the existence of planets .    based on observations with the nasa / esa hubble space telescope obtained at the space telescope science institute ( stsci ) , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy .",
    "support for proposal number go-9475 was provided by nasa through a grant from stsci under nasa contract nas5 - 26555 .",
