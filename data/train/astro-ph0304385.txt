    "recent observational data from type ia supernovae and cmb anisotropies suggests that large scale cosmic dynamics are dominated by a repulsive type of matter  energy density , generically known as a `` dark energy '' . in its most simple empirical formulation , dark energy can be described as a `` @xmath0field '' associated with the `` cosmological constant '' .",
    "more sophisticated models of dark energy take the form of scalar field sources in which the @xmath0field corresponds to the limit of vanishing scalar field gradients .",
    "this paper addresses an important issue in this context , namely : to examine if this type of repulsive interaction has any influence on the equilibrium of virialized galactic halo structures .",
    "various aspects regarding this question have been considered previously in the literature .",
    "lahav et al .",
    "( 1991 ) have argued , using newtonian spherical infall models ( or `` top hat '' models ) , that the effects of a cosmological constant can be neglected in the study of structure formation .",
    "further improvements of `` top hat '' models incorporating @xmath0 and/or quintessence  like fields have been considered by wang & steinhardt ( 1998 ) , iliev & shapiro ( 2001 ) and lokas & hoffman ( 2001 ) .",
    "constraints on @xmath0 at the level of clusters and superclusters have been placed by means of optical gravitational lens surveys ( quast & helbig 1999 ) and peculiar velocities of galaxies ( zehavi & dekel 1999 ) .",
    "other papers ( e.g. axenides et al .",
    "2000 , nowakowski 2001 and nowakowski et al .",
    "2001 ) have studied the effect of @xmath0 on galactic structures within the framework of general relativity , though looking at this effect not in the self  gravitating sources themselves , but through the dynamics of test observers in a schwarzschild - desitter field that is supposed to be the `` external '' field of these sources .    in this paper",
    "we complement and extend previous work by studying a spherically symmetric , self  gravitating , maxwell  boltzmann ( mb ) gas in hydrostatic equilibrium with a @xmath0field given as a `` cosmological constant '' , subject to observational constraints .",
    "although galactic halo structures are characterized by newtonian energies and velocities , we find it to be more correct to examine these sources within general relativity and then obtain the adequate ( `` weak field '' ) newtonian limit .",
    "the reason for this approach follows from the fact that in newtonian physics the mass density is the only source of gravitation and so a non  gravitational interaction , such as the @xmath0field , does not contribute to the `` effective gravitational mass '' . in general relativity , on the other hand , all forms of matter  energy count as sources of gravitation ( curvature of spacetime ) .",
    "therefore , even in the newtonian limit , the matter  energy contribution from the @xmath0field could be comparable ( or at least might not be negligible in comparison ) to rest ",
    "mass density of the mb gas , so that the hydrostatic equations furnished by the newtonian limit might not coincide with those `` naively '' obtained from a newtonian framework .",
    "as we show in this paper , for a mb gas and a constant @xmath0field , the newtonian limit yields a different set of equilibrium equations from those of newtonian theory .",
    "however , we can not know _ a priori _ if this difference leads to significant or negligible effects until we solve the equilibrium equations and compare their solutions in both cases . such ambiguity regarding the newtonian limit would not arise if we were only dealing with a mb gas ( a thermal source ) , this is so because in this case the internal energy ( the only contribution to matter  energy besides rest  mass ) is negligible in comparison with rest ",
    "mass , leading to the `` isothermal sphere '' as the unequivocal newtonian limit .",
    "it is a well known result that within the hierarchical model of structure formation ( white & rees 1978 ) the final halo structure which results from the repeated merger events building up a galaxy is well represented not by an isothermal structure , but by a centrally divergent steep inner halo profile , first noted by navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 ) , and since confirmed by numerous authors .",
    "however , controversy still surrounds this result in as much as direct dynamical studies of galactic rotation curves , across wide dynamical ranges in galaxy size , appear to indicate the presence of a constant density core in the dark haloes of galaxies ( e.g. burkert & silk 1997 , de blok , mcgaugh & rubin 2001 , firmani et al .",
    "2001 , among others ) .",
    "this being the case , we think it worthwhile to study in depth the modifications a simple isothermal halo suffers in the presence of a dominant @xmath15 component , even though this results may prove to be merely indicative of a case where not just a stable halo is being treated , but including the full merger - driven formation of such a structure .",
    "whatever the correct structure scenario eventually turns out to be , a detailed understanding of the behaviour of the quintessential galactic halo toy model -the isothermal halo- in the presence of an important cosmological @xmath15 term , will surely prove valuable .",
    "the organization of the paper is described below .",
    "sections ii , iii and iv respectively provide the general relativistic formulation for a non  relativistic mb gas , a @xmath0field as a zero gradient limit of a quintessence  like scalar field and the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium for these sources .",
    "we examine the newtonian limit of the models in section v , showing that in the equilibrium equations in this limit do not coincide with the corresponding newtonian equations for the same sources . in section",
    "vi we discuss the cut off length scales , @xmath16 , introduced by the @xmath0field , comparing them in section vii ( by means of rough qualitative arguments ) with physically motivated length scales of virialized halo structures ( virialization radius and critical radius associated with antonov instability ) .",
    "in section viii we review briefly the equilibrium equations for the king halos , while in section ix we use the numerical integration of the various sets of equilibrium equations in order to verify the issues discussed analytically and qualitatively in previous sections : the difference between the newtonian limit of general relativity and a pure newtonian framework and the fact that @xmath13 is 57 times larger than physically motivated length scales .",
    "we briefly summarize these results in section x. the paper contains 9 figures obtained from the numerical solution of the equilibrium equations .",

    "general relativity is currently the best available theory of gravitation , we suggest that the system of equations ( [ feqnewt3])([poissonnl ] ) should be preferred ( at least conceptually ) to the purely newtonian system of equations ( [ feqnewt4])([poissonpn ] ) . in fact , these systems have different solutions and if the differences in these solutions are not negligible , this can ( in principle ) be relevant in dark matter tracing and gravitational lensing methods used for estimating the properties of dark matter haloes of galactic clusters .",
    "the long numerical integrations of cosmological n - body simulations imply that even minor correction factors , of the type discussed here , could have important effects on the final result .",
    "figures 2a and 2b illustrate how the correct newtonian limit of a maxwell  boltzmann gas in equilibrium with a @xmath0field is furnished by equations ( [ feqnewt3])([poissonnl ] ) , just as the newtonian limit without @xmath0 is the isothermal sphere . however , before solving equations ( [ feqnewt3 ] ) and ( [ feqnewt4 ] ) numerically it is not possible to know if the differences in their solutions are significant or negligible .",

    "energy density is @xmath118 , while its volume average is & &  =  =   + & & =  + _ , [ rhoav]therefore , conditions ( [ condexist ] ) and ( [ condstab ] ) can be given respectively as & & >  2_,[condexist_ave ] + + & & > 2_,[condstab_ave]where we used equation ( [ lambda ] ) and @xmath119 .",
    "equations ( [ xlambda_1 ] ) and ( [ xlambda_2 ] ) then become ( x_1 ) & & =  2_,[xlambda1_ave ] + ( x_2 ) + ( x_2 ) & & = 2_,[xlambda2_ave]from the volume averaging definition ( [ rhoav ] ) , we obtain by integration by parts  =   = -hence , for @xmath94 , where @xmath120 is either one of @xmath121 , we have have : @xmath122 .",
    "since condition ( [ condexist_ave ] ) holds in this range , then @xmath123 follows from @xmath124 ( because @xmath125 ) .",
    "therefore for any @xmath66 in the range of interest we have @xmath126 .",
    "hence , the root @xmath127 corresponds to larger density values than @xmath128 , but since both @xmath105 and @xmath129 decrease with @xmath66 , we must necessarily have x_2  x_1,[xlambda12]which is a reasonable result , since it is to be expected that the repulsive @xmath0field will destabilize those circular orbits with radii @xmath130 that lie near the length scale @xmath128 beyond which no such orbits exist . as we show in section ix ,",
    "the range @xmath131 corresponds to a transition zone between the isothermal region @xmath132 and the asymptotic region @xmath133 dominated by the @xmath0field .",
    "thus , since @xmath134 marks the maximal radius of a stable circular orbit , we can consider this radius as a `` cut off '' scale for isothermal spheres in hydrostatic equilibrium with a @xmath0field . in the remaining of this section",
    "we will use simple qualitative arguments to compare other cut off length scales of the isothermal sphere with @xmath128 . since numerical estimates ( see figure 5a ) show that @xmath127 is about two thirds of @xmath128 ( see section ix ) , this comparison can be extended to @xmath127 as well .",
    "consider the virialization radius , @xmath135 , the currently accepted physical cut off scale associated with the virialization of galactic structures ( padmanabhan 1995 ) .",
    "the condition to determine the value of this length scale follows from the newtonian spherical `` in fall '' ( or `` top hat '' ) model as lokas & hoffman ( 2001 ) , iliev & shapiro ( 2001 ) and padnamabhan ( 1995 ) show , ( r_)|_z _  ( z_),[rvir]or , equivalently ( using equations ( [ adimvars ] ) and ( [ rhoav ] ) ) , as  , [ rvir2]where the factor @xmath136 is a model dependent ( see lokas & hoffman 2001 for a discussion on this issue ) contrast factor between the average rest  mass density of the overdense region and the critical density of the cosmological background , both evaluated at a virialization epoch , @xmath137 , which depends on the galactic structure and/or a specific structure formation model . from equations ( [ xlambda1_ave ] ) and ( [ rvir ] ) , we can see that both @xmath138 and @xmath139 are proportional to @xmath108 . therefore , for all @xmath140 , once the galactic structure has virialized and the equilibrium equations are valid , we have  , [ rvir0 ] or the same expression with a factor 3 instead of 2 if we had used the newtonian equations ( [ feqnewt4 ] ) . since it is reasonable to assume ( to a good approximation ) that @xmath141 for @xmath142 , a rough qualitative estimate of the ratio @xmath143",
    "is  ~^1/2 , [ rlv]considering that @xmath144 in the case when the cosmological background complies with @xmath145 ( lokas & hoffman 2001 ) , this estimate means that for present day virialized structures @xmath146 is approximately one order of magnitude larger than @xmath135 . because of equation ( [ xlambda12 ] ) , @xmath13 should be less than an order of magnitude larger than @xmath135 .",
    "the precise numerical value of @xmath147 is displayed in figure 5b , while the qualitative estimates mentioned before are corroborated numerically in figures 6 and 7 , showing that @xmath13 is about seven times larger than @xmath135 . using the newtonian equations ( [ feqnewt4 ] ) yields smaller @xmath146 and @xmath13 by a factor of @xmath148 . in either case , these results indicate that the @xmath0field should have a negligible effect on the virialization process .",
    "another physically motivated length scale , characteristic of the isothermal sphere , is the critical radius associated with the antonov instability , or with the onset of the gravothermal catastrophe .",
    "this radius follows from demanding that the structural parameters of an isothermal sphere should correspond to a stable thermal equilibrium , characterized by a second variation of a suitably defined entropy functional . as discussed in padmanabhan ( 1990 ) , for all isothermal spheres extending up to a critical radius @xmath149",
    "so that @xmath150 is the newtonian total energy at @xmath149 , the constraint @xmath151 must hold , though stable configuration with local maxima must also satisfy @xmath152 , while isothermal spheres complying with @xmath151 but for which @xmath153 correspond to metastable configurations in which the entropy extrema is a saddle point . the critical radius @xmath149 complies with  =  709,[709]corresponding to the maximal stable isothermal sphere for which entropy is a local maximum .",
    "using equation ( [ lambda ] ) , we can find the ratio  =  , [ r2cr]which can be compared to the ratio of @xmath154 to @xmath108 given by equation ( [ rvir0 ] ) .",
    "this yields approximately  ~  ~,[r2vir]but , if @xmath155 , then we should have approximately @xmath141 for @xmath156 , hence we obtain a ratio  ~ ( ) ^1/2,[rvir]and also the following ratio analogous to ( [ rlv ] )  ~   ( ) ^1/2.[rlambda]assuming that @xmath157 , equations ( [ rvir ] ) and ( [ rlambda ] ) show that for values ( consistent with current estimates ) around @xmath158 ( see figures 5 and 6 ) , the virialization radius is about the same order of magnitude as the length scale @xmath149 of equation ( [ 709 ] ) and about one to two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath159 .",
    "an estimate of the value of @xmath149 in mpc follows from the fact that the variables ( [ adimvars ] ) that we use coincide ( save notation differences , a minus sign in @xmath59 ) with those defined in equations ( 4.21 ) and ( 4.22 ) of padmanabhan ( 1990 ) which yield @xmath160 . using equation ( [ r0vals ] )",
    "we obtain r(r )  =  1.467 10 ^ -4 ( ) ^1/2 . + [ rvals]by looking at the numerical solutions for the equilibrium equations ( [ feqnewt3 ] ) and ( [ feqnewt4 ] )",
    ", we will verify in section ix the qualitative estimates of @xmath146,@xmath13,@xmath135 and @xmath149 that we have presented above .",
    "these estimates tend to support the conclusion that the effects of a @xmath0 field can be ignored in the study of virialized structures .",
    "it is interesting to compare the effect of a @xmath0field on a mb distribution with other distribution functions ( but without @xmath0 ) .",
    "we examine briefly the case of the michie  king models , obtained by truncation of the mb distribution at a given maximal escape velocity ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "this distribution functions leads to equilibrium equations similar to ( [ feqnewt2 ] ) , but with @xmath53 given by binney & tremaine ( 1987 ) and katz ( 1980 ) & & = , + & &  + _ 0,_0  , + k(x ) & & = ^x(x^1/2)- ( 1 + x),where @xmath59",
    "is given by equation ( [ defpsi ] ) , while @xmath161 for @xmath162 satisfying the constraint @xmath163 .",
    "the @xmath164 is known as the `` tidal radius '' marking a theoretical cut off scale whose value depends on @xmath165 .",
    "the equilibrium equations for the king models expressed in terms of the dimensionless variables @xmath66 and @xmath60 are then    & & = x^2 , + & & = - .",
    "[ feqk]since @xmath166 and @xmath167 , the integration of these equations requires one to specify a given value of @xmath165 , leading to a family of numerical solutions parametrized by @xmath165 .",
    "theoretical studies of the king distribution applied to globular clusters ( see katz 1980 ) yield the stability range @xmath168 , though there are observations and theoretical estimates allowing for values up to @xmath169 .    as we will show in the following section , the dynamical variables of the king models behave asymptotically in a very different manner from those of the mb models with @xmath0 .",
    "however , the cut off scale @xmath170 in the latter is of the same order of magnitude as the tidal radius of king models with deep potential wells ( @xmath171 ) .",
    "we solve numerically the systems of equations ( [ feqrel ] ) , ( [ feqnewt2 ] ) , ( [ feqnewt3 ] ) , ( [ feqnewt4 ] ) and ( [ feqk ] ) , assuming the regularity conditions @xmath172 , for @xmath173 and suitable values of the free parameters @xmath174 .",
    "it is interesting to examine the newtonian limit of the mb gas ( with and without the @xmath0field ) by looking at how an isothermal behavior emerges as temperature gradients decrease for sequentially decreasing values of the ratio @xmath175 , starting from relativistic values down to smaller newtonian velocities . using @xmath59 from the numerical solution of equation ( [ feqrel ] ) , we plot in figure 1 the normalized temperature , @xmath176 , given by equation ( [ temp ] ) vs @xmath177 for four values in the range",
    "@xmath178 down to @xmath179 , that is from @xmath180 km / sec to @xmath181 km / sec ( still a dispersion velocity much larger than that of any galactic structure ) .",
    "as shown in this figure , the temperature gradients of the mb gas are already small ( @xmath182 ) even for @xmath183 km / sec , suggesting that even for more relativistic values of @xmath175 the linearized expression ( [ tempnl ] ) can be used instead of equation ( [ temp ] ) .",
    "these gradients steadily decrease for smaller @xmath175 , becoming negligible for the velocities characteristic of galactic structures , and so approaching in the limit @xmath184 an isothermal condition @xmath64 . in the case",
    "@xmath185 the temperature curves steadily decrease so that @xmath186 as @xmath187 .",
    "however , if there is a @xmath0field , then these curves stop decreasing at @xmath188 and begin to oscillate around a constant value , @xmath189 , that can be identified as a characteristic temperature of the @xmath0field .",
    "the newtonian limit of equation ( [ feqrel ] ) can also be illustrated by means of sequences of curves corresponding to @xmath59 obtained from equation ( [ feqrel ] ) for sequentially decreasing values of @xmath175 .",
    "the curves of figure 2a ( @xmath69 ) clearly tend to the thick curve at the bottom , marked as `` is '' , corresponding to @xmath59 for the isothermal sphere , obtained from equation ( [ feqnewt2 ] ) . in figure",
    "2b we consider the case with nonzero @xmath15 given by equation ( [ lambda ] ) .",
    "it is evident that the sequence of curves tends to the thick curve , marked nl , corresponding to @xmath59 obtained from equation ( [ feqnewt3 ] ) and not to the thick curve , marked `` n '' , that corresponds to @xmath59 obtained from equation ( [ feqnewt4 ] ) .",
    "hence , the correct newtonian limit of a mb gas with a @xmath0 field is given by equations ( [ feqnewt3])([poissonnl ] ) and not by the newtonian equations ( [ feqnewt4])([poissonpn ] ) .",
    "numerical solution of the systems ( [ feqnewt3 ] ) and ( [ feqnewt4 ] ) allow us to depict graphically conditions ( [ condexist])([condstab ] ) ( figures 3a and 3b ) , conditions ( [ condexist_ave])([condstab_ave ] ) giving the same results , where the length scales for the existence and stability of circular orbits , @xmath128 and @xmath127 , follow from the roots given by equations ( [ xlambda_1])([xlambda_2 ] ) and ( [ xlambda1_ave])([xlambda2_ave ] ) .",
    "assuming @xmath190 , the following numerical values emerge from figure 3a : @xmath191 , @xmath192 , while for the newtonian equations ( [ feqnewt4 ] ) we obtain smaller values ( see figure 3b ) : @xmath193 , @xmath194 .",
    "for the same value of @xmath9 and for the newtonian limit equations ( [ feqnewt3 ] ) we obtain from figure 5 : @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "these values of @xmath66 can be translated into actual distances for specific galactic structures by using @xmath197 where @xmath54 is given by equation ( [ r0vals ] ) .",
    "the resulting length scales are shown in table 1 .    as we mentioned in section vi",
    ", the conditions ( [ condexist])([condstab ] ) for the existence and stability of circular geodesic orbits are violated for @xmath198 .",
    "this possibility is illustrated by figure 3c , where these conditions are plotted for @xmath199 , clearly showing how conditions ( [ condexist])([condstab ] ) do not hold around the center ( though they do hold in disconnected ranges of @xmath66 that exclude the center ) .",
    "since both @xmath9 and @xmath108 are functions of the cosmic era , condition ( [ min_lam ] ) with the help of equation ( [ rhocrz ] ) yields a minimal bound of @xmath9 for virialized structures complying with conditions ( [ condexist])([condstab ] ) .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 4 , showing that structures of relatively recent virialization easily meet this minimal bound , though for galaxies which virialized at @xmath200 , the fulfillment of condition ( [ min_lam ] ) is non  trivial , leading to @xmath201 , a value that is consistent with current estimates of @xmath9 .    in figures 3a  b and 5 we considered @xmath202 . in order to find out the dependence of the values of @xmath121 and @xmath149 on @xmath9 , we plot in figure 6 the ratios of these length scales with respect to @xmath147 , clearly emerging from this figure that @xmath128 and @xmath127 have a very weak dependence on @xmath9 and are , respectively , about 10 and 7 times larger than @xmath147 ( for the newtonian case these figures are about two thirds smaller ) .",
    "however , @xmath149 is quite sensitive to @xmath9 , with @xmath203 for densities in the range @xmath204 .",
    "this is a nice result , illustrating that these two physically motivated length scales approximately coincide for values of @xmath9 close to current estimates .",
    "all length scales we have considered show a clear linear dependence on @xmath62 ( from equation ( [ r0vals ] ) ) .",
    "this is shown in figure 7 , displaying the graph of each length scale as a function of @xmath62 for a wide range of values of @xmath9 ( @xmath205 ) .",
    "since the dependence on @xmath9 is very weak , the strip of lines for all values of @xmath9 simply makes the lines thicker .",
    "._length scales for galactic structures .",
    "dwarf and large galaxies and clusters are respectively characterized by @xmath206 km / sec .",
    "the length scales @xmath16 and @xmath135 were evaluated for @xmath207 .",
    "see also figures 6 and 7 .",
    "_ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the effects of the @xmath0field can be clearly illustrated by plotting relevant physical variables of the isothermal halos , such as the density profiles and rotation velocity along circular orbits .",
    "figure 8 depicts a logarithmic plot of the rest  mass density , @xmath105 , normalized by @xmath108 for @xmath208 , in comparison with the rest - mass density of the isothermal sphere and of king halos associated with various values of @xmath165 ( only the newtonian limit `` nl '' case",
    "is shown ) .",
    "it is evident that in the range @xmath132 where stable circular orbits exist , the density curve of the nl case is almost identical with that of the isothermal sphere ( marked as `` is '' ) .",
    "however , in the asymptotic range @xmath209 , these curves are completely different , since for the is @xmath105 simply decays as @xmath210 while in the nl case it oscillates around a value close to @xmath108 . since @xmath211 , these oscillations mark relative maxima and minima of the newtonian potential , hence @xmath188 marks an unstable equilibrium where this potential becomes repulsive ( though furhter out it alternates from repulsive to attractive ) .",
    "clearly , this behavior of the asymptotic region is dominated by the @xmath0field and is in stark contrast with the behavior of the isothermal region @xmath132 .",
    "the region @xmath212 , where circular orbits exist but are unstable , is a transition zone between the isothermal and asymptotic zones .",
    "however , in the physical range @xmath213 , the effects of the @xmath0field are practically negligible .",
    "notice that @xmath105 for the nl case is also very different from the density curves of the king halos , though the cut off boundary ( the tidal radius ) of some of these halos ( @xmath214 ) can be of the same order of magnitude ( or even larger ) than @xmath127 .",
    "rotation velocities normalized by @xmath62 are given by equation ( [ rotvel ] ) .",
    "these `` rotation curves '' are plotted in figure 9 for the nl case for @xmath215 , in comparison with rotation curves of the isothermal sphere and of king halos associated with various values of @xmath165 .",
    "the figure also displays the cut off length scales @xmath121 , separating the isothermal , asymptotic and transition zones , as well as the physical radius @xmath147 .",
    "since this is not a logarithmic plot , the effects of the @xmath0field are more noticeable .",
    "for example , in the nl case the rotation curve is not flat and decreases significantly already in the isothermal region , though it is practically identical to the rotation curve of the isothermal sphere in the range @xmath213 where all visible matter would be located .",
    "the rotation curve of the nl case plunges to zero for @xmath188 , so that for a range of values @xmath209 circular geodesic orbits do not exist .",
    "this is connected to the fact that @xmath188 marks an unstable equilibrium where the newtonian potential becomes repulsive .",
    "however , this potential oscillates , hence it becomes again attractive and then repulsive again , all of this in disconnected domains of @xmath66 for @xmath209 . as a comparison , the rotation curves of king halos ( evaluated up to their tidal radii ) also decrease but never reach zero .",
    "we have examined the equilibrium of a mb gas in the presence of a @xmath0field constrained by recent observational data .",
    "proceeding from a general relativistic framework and carefully taking the newtonian limit , we obtain the equilibrium equations ( [ feqnewt3])([poissonnl ] ) that are different form those that follow from a `` naive '' newtonian treatment that would simply add the @xmath0field to an isothermal sphere ( i.e. equations ( [ feqnewt4])([poissonpn ] ) ) .",
    "we have shown that the presence of this repulsive field implies that isothermal configurations are now characterized by the length scales , @xmath121 , defined by conditions ( [ condexist ] ) and ( [ condstab ] ) and respectively associated with existence and stability of circular geodesic orbits .",
    "we have shown that these length scales can also be characterized by the constraints given by ( [ condexist_ave ] ) and ( [ condstab_ave ] ) on the rest  mass density and its volume average , hence @xmath216 .",
    "the fulfillment of the existence and stability constraints in a region containing the symmetry center @xmath96 yields a minimal central rest ",
    "mass density @xmath217 , and thus a minimal central density of @xmath218 for galactic structures having virialized at @xmath200 . since @xmath134 marks the radius of the largest stable circular orbit , it is reasonable to consider this radius as the cut off length scale of isothermal configurations in equilibrium with a @xmath0field .",
    "the numerical solution of the equilibrium equations provides precise numerical estimates of all involved length scales , showing that @xmath127 is about 7 times larger than physically motivated cut off length scales of isothermal halos , such as the virialization radius @xmath147 and the radius for the onset of antonov instability @xmath149 . by looking at the graphs of the rest ",
    "mass density and rotation curves , we can identify isothermal ( @xmath132 ) , asymptotic ( @xmath209 ) and transition ( @xmath212 ) regions in which these variables change from an almost isothermal behavior to an asymptotic regime dominated by the @xmath0field .",
    "it is quite noticeable that up to the physical cut off scale , @xmath147 , the behavior of the mb gas with the @xmath0field is practically indistinguishable from that of an isothermal sphere .",
    "therefore , for the purposes of studying the equilibrium state of virialized structures , the effects of the @xmath0field are negligible and can be safely ignored .",
    "however , these effects might be important in the study of the gravitational clustering of larger structures that have already left the linear regime but are not yet virialized , or the formation of galactic structures ( though the assumption of thermodynamical equilibrium might not be applicable in these cases ) .",
    "finally , the zero gradient approximation associated with the constant @xmath0field is basically a toy model of more general quintessence  like sources described by non ",
    "trivial scalar fields .",
    "the equilibrium of a mb gas together with such a source could yield interesting features that are absent in the @xmath0field approximation .",
