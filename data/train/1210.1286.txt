    "below @xmath32 , a negative indirect gap ( not shown ) results due to significant lowering of the bottom of the conduction band at the @xmath37 point , though the direct gap is already established ( the occupied and unoccupied bands are disjoint ) . this feature may be related with the proposal of a continuous transition in opening an energy gap , as discussed in another osmate cd@xmath16os@xmath16o@xmath23 by shinaoka _ et al._@xcite considering a likely @xmath380.5 ev , @xmath39 2.7 ev @xmath40 suggests for this multiband system that a mott transition is not the appropriate picture for this continuous mit .    the corresponding band structure at @xmath32 is displayed in fig .",
    "[ band2 ] .",
    "the soc splitting is about 0.2 ev at the @xmath41-point .",
    "an unusual outcome of the structural distortion is that the top of the valence bands is nearly flat , reflected in the step increase in the valence band dos evident in fig .",
    "[ afmdos ] , and providing a two - dimensional character to the low energy phase space .",
    "we also point out that the dispersion is very similar above and below @xmath42 , relevant information for yet - to - be - done optical experiments since the @xmath43-conserving joint dos may be sharply peaked at the onset of absorption . within lsda+u+soc",
    "as in lsda , the afm state is nearly degenerate with the nm state .",
    "the fact that neither state is energetically favored is consistent with the finite temperature transition between the two states .",
    "the value of @xmath4 appropriate for naoso@xmath0 has already been mentioned in the literature , in addition to the conclusion @xmath442 ev of du _",
    "_ that is nearly identical to ours .",
    "et al . _ reported data on magnetic x - ray resonant scattering ( mxrs ) with interpretation from x - ray absorption near edge spectra ( xanes ) obtained from joly s finite difference code.@xcite they obtained a better correspondence using @xmath45 than with nonzero @xmath4 .",
    "we think there is no direct contradiction . in their work",
    "they are dealing with resonant transitions between deep @xmath46 and @xmath47 levels and unoccupied @xmath13 states . in our work , based on the self - consistent lda+u method , the effect of @xmath4 is to increase the separation of occupied @xmath13 bands and unoccupied @xmath13 bands , which is a different issue involving a @xmath4 in a different manner .      as discussed for several decades , @xmath3 orbitals when split off from the @xmath35 orbitals by the crystal field ,",
    "form a representation of an angular momentum of @xmath48.@xcite in the spherical hund s rule limit the total angular momentum is zero for a high spin @xmath49 system . especially in this locally - cubic geometry and half filling , the orbital moment should be small . as shown in table [ table2 ] , inclusion of soc leads to an orbital moment antialigned with the spin moment and with magnitude no larger than 0.1 @xmath8 .",
    "thus in the insulating state the net moment remains about 1 @xmath8 , consistent with the experimentally observed value,@xcite and relatively insensitive to @xmath36 in the range studied here ( see table [ table2 ] ) .",
    "we have calculated total energies with lda+u+soc with four spin orientations @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 to determine the easy axis . as observed by calder _",
    "et al._,@xcite @xmath52 is the easy axis . along @xmath51 , both spin and orbital moments increase by 10% in magnitude , but the energy cost is large , 474 mev / f.u .",
    ", despite some additional hund s coupling energy .",
    "along @xmath53 , the spin moment is enhanced to 1.25 @xmath8 while the energy is higher by 51 mev / f.u .",
    "consistent with the similarities between the @xmath54 and @xmath30 axes ( the octahedron rotation is around the @xmath55 axis ) the energy difference is small , only 5 mev / f.u .",
    "approached from high temperature , a continuous mit occurs at the point where the spin - symmetric phase becomes unstable to magnetic order , which is afm order in the case of naoso@xmath0 . in slater - type ( itinerant ) transitions , ordering conventionally is driven by fermi surface ( fs ) nesting , as in the classic case of chromium .",
    "the common picture for a slater mit is that a spin density wave ( sdw ) gaps at least a portion of the fs , and the increasing amplitude of the sdw destroys more and more of the fs as the temperature is lowered .",
    "the specific heat data for naoso@xmath0 indicate the fs is completely gone as t@xmath560 .",
    "the resistivity data strongly suggests it has been effectively destroyed at intermediate temperature , since the magnitude and temperature coefficient reflect insulating behavior even as spin - fluctuation scattering has began to be frozen out by the magnetic order ( which , in itself , should _ lower _ rather than increase the resistivity ) , and the strongly decreasing hall coefficient is consistent with rapidly shrinking fss . in this section",
    "we first discuss the electronic structure in the ( high temperature ) nonmagnetic metallic state , albeit without consideration of the thermal broadening and the lattice dynamical and spin fluctuation scattering that may be necessary for a detailed picture .",
    "then we provide a scenario for the mit that is consistent with observations and what is understood about the electronic structure .",
    "the lda and lda+soc band structures without magnetic order are displayed together in fig .",
    "[ nmband ] .",
    "we have checked that including u@xmath57 in this nonmagnetic phase leads to negligible effect , as is commonly observed . in the previous section we established",
    "that soc has relatively little impact on the bands in the afm phase , displaying its main impact by its seeming competition with correlation effects so that the correlation strength necessary to open the gap ( within the afm phase ) is doubled to @xmath102 ev . near @xmath42 , the effect of soc on the band structure ( fig .",
    "[ nmband ] ) in the high t phase again seems minor , but it is clearly visible at symmetry points ( y , s ) where it removes degeneracies and splits bands .",
    "moreover , the effect on the dos is minor , as is clear from the inset of fig .",
    "[ nmband ] . with or without soc ,",
    "the fermi level dos n(@xmath42 ) @xmath58 3 states / ev - f.u . for both spins , corresponding to a linear specific heat coefficient @xmath59 = 7 mj / mol - k@xmath60 .",
    "this standard metallic value is corroborated by large fs sheets , which we now discuss .",
    "because the topology of the fss is central to a sdw transition , we display fss without and with soc in fig .",
    "the small shifts in band energies due to soc that can be seen in fig .",
    "[ nmband ] are translated by the small velocities into considerable changes in the complex multi - sheeted fss , with some of the clearest changes occurring around the symmetry points .",
    "the fss retain to some extent an approximate 4-fold symmetry in the @xmath54-@xmath30 plane ( @xmath61 plane in fig .",
    "[ fs ] ) , which of course is not a true symmetry of the @xmath31 structure but is useful to recognize .",
    "there are both electron and hole type surfaces , making the magnitude of the hall coefficient difficult to interpret .",
    "most theoretical work on afm transitions in metals , including very recent ones , focus either on fs nesting ( cr is the classic example ) or fs `` hot spots '' involving band and fs folding due to the finite-@xmath12 order that set in at the transition . in the first case",
    "the nested sections of fs become gapped , while in the second case the fs also reconstructs but in a less obvious manner .",
    "for example , sachdev _",
    "et al._@xcite review the latter scenario and provide evidence of a breakdown of fermionic quasiparticle excitations at the transition , and a fs reconstruction from large to small surfaces that have been discussed for many years in the high temperature superconducting cuprates .",
    "both the nesting scenario and the hot spot scenario of the continuous slater transition to an afm incurs difficulty in naoso@xmath0 , because it is a _",
    "q=0 ordering _ for which both scenarios , which focus on a nonzero wavevector @xmath62 , become moot .",
    "this situation can arise , and not uncommonly does so , in crystal structures with more than one magnetic ion of a given type . in naoso@xmath0 , the four symmetry - related os ions in the gdfeo@xmath0 distorted lattice devolve into two pairs , with spins in opposite directions .",
    "interestingly , the original exposition by slater@xcite did not involve finite-@xmath12 physics in any explicit manner .",
    "his picture , based on spin - unrestricted hartree - fock theory , was that afm ordering would introduce new fourier components in the ( spin dependent ) potential , leading to new gaps in the band structure that could well appear at the fermi level , especially in stoichiometric compounds where there is the likelihood that bands can be completely occupied , or completely unoccupied .",
    "if the new gaps appear at a zone boundary , it will be energetically favored to double the periodicity , as in the simplest picture of sdw order . yet",
    "if the new gaps appear only at @xmath12=0 ( no cell doubling ) , the band structure may still become gapped in spite of the lack of any extension of periodicity .",
    "the effect of afm ordering in naoso@xmath0 on the electronic structure can be seen by comparing the metallic bands of the nonmagnetic high t phase in fig .",
    "[ nmband ] ( solid lines ) with the afm insulating bands in fig .",
    "[ band2 ] .",
    "new fourier components of the potential separate the bands strongly at zone boundary symmetry points ( _ viz .",
    "_ r , y , s ) and at the zone center the bands are already split .",
    "slater also tied this type of ordering to bonding - antibonding band formation , which provides a band energy ( bonding energy ) gain in addition to the hund s rule ( magnetic ) gain in energy .",
    "a rudimentary picture that is consistent with data and with this understanding of the electronic structure can be assembled . already at high t the strongly distorted , four f.u .",
    "per primitive cell , structure is dictated by the tolerance ratio of 0.87 .",
    "the distortion leaves flat bands at and near the fs , which is large and multi - sheeted . at t@xmath27 , magnetic order sets in and the metallic band structure begins to morph continuously toward the t=0 afm insulating band structure .",
    "the fss , both electron and hole type , begin to shrink in volume and vanish one - by - one , until no fs remains .",
    "the change from the metallic to the insulating band structure should be monotonic in , and nearly proportional to , the magnetic order parameter .",
    "the magnetic order parameter measured by calder _",
    "_ was provided only down to @xmath100.85 t@xmath27,@xcite so it is not possible to estimate when the last fs may be expected to disappear .",
    "as mentioned earlier , thermal smearing and lattice and spin fluctuations will complicate a detailed picture .",
    "one loose end in this picture is the apparent discontinuity  a jump by roughly 50%  in the paramagnetic susceptibility@xcite just below t@xmath27 .    without a fermi surface or hot spot origin ,",
    "the mechanism of g - type ordering is not clear , and was not addressed by du _",
    "_ in their theoretical study of magnetic ordering.@xcite since g - type ordering is common in perovskite transition metal oxides , it seems likely this ordering represents an emergence of the nearest neighbor afm coupling commonly occurring in perovskites , in spite of the apparent itineracy in the electronic structure and the collapse of the @xmath11 valence state picture .",
    "our results have clarified a number of features of naoso@xmath0 , and the questions posed in sec .",
    "i. first , a combination of the distortion of the perovskite structure and moderate correlation effects is responsible for both antiferromagnetism and the insulating gap in the ground state .",
    "our calculations account naturally for the factor of three reduction in the observed moment ( 1@xmath8 ) relative to the ideal @xmath49 value , due to very strong hybridization with the o @xmath63 orbitals that render the conduction states , and the magnetism , itinerant in nature . the oxygen ions , being coordinated with two os ions with antialigned spins , are unpolarized by ( approximate ) symmetry .",
    "the calculated energetics , with small energy difference between the magnetic and non - magnetic states , is also consistent with a slater - type metal - to - insulator transition to an afm state .",
    "moreover , the simplest specification of a mott insulator is one in which the insulating state does not depend on magnetic order . in naoso@xmath0",
    "all the evidence indicates that magnetic order is _ necessary _ for insulating behavior .",
    "because of the itinerant nature of the moment , a heisenberg model can not provide a representation which could then be applied to predict the nel temperature .",
    "spin - orbit coupling , often a dominant force in @xmath13 metal oxides , has a more modest effect in this compound .",
    "while it effects the band structure enough that the effective coupling strength u@xmath57 is increased from 1 ev to 2.2 ev , it is in itself ineffective in decreasing the local moment . the strong moment reduction ( from a localized high - spin @xmath3 picture of 3@xmath8 )",
    "is due to strong hybridization with o @xmath63 orbitals  that is , itineracy  which is itself affected by the distortion .",
    "the minor importance of soc is consistent with the finding of calder _ et al . _",
    "that xray resonant photoelectron spectra show only minor effect of soc.@xcite    though @xmath64 perovskite oxides have been studied extensively for decades , their @xmath13 counterparts are relatively new to detailed inspection of their properties and the underlying mechanisms . our results for naoso@xmath0 will help to provide a basis for understanding the distinctions in the physics of @xmath13 versus @xmath64 ( and @xmath65 ) oxides .",
