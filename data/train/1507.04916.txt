    "there are 35 @xmath4-nuclei on the neutron deficient side of the valley of stability between @xmath5se and @xmath6hg , which are shielded against production by the neutron - capture processes and are produced in the @xmath4-process .",
    "the main production of these @xmath4-nuclei occurs via ( @xmath7 ) , ( @xmath8 ) and ( @xmath9 ) reactions , and subsequent beta decays in the so - called @xmath3-process .",
    "therefore , it is essential to determine cross sections of photodisintegration reactions or their inverse reactions for @xmath4-process network calculations @xcite .",
    "thousands of nuclear reactions are involved in network calculations for @xmath4-process nucleosynthesis .",
    "however , only very few of the required cross sections have been measured by experiments , and thus most of them rely solely on predictions of the hauser - feshbach ( hf ) model codes , e.g. , non - smoker @xcite and talys @xcite , which often have very large uncertainties from nuclear input parameters @xcite .    following current @xmath4-process network calculations @xcite ,",
    "the pattern of the solar abundance for about 60% of the @xmath4-nuclei is reproduced within a factor of 3 . however , for the @xmath10mo and @xmath11ru isotopes , an underproduction of a factor of 20 - 50 has been calculated for the @xmath3-process in core collapse supernova models with massive stars of 13 - 25 m@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this deficiency has motivated the search for additional production mechanisms , e.g. , the @xmath13-process @xcite or the @xmath14@xmath4-process @xcite , but also intensified efforts to remove the uncertainty in required nuclear physics parameters by measuring reaction cross sections .",
    "these cross sections are most sensitive to nuclear parameters , i.e. , the @xmath3-ray strength function , nuclear level density and optical potential , in the hf model @xcite . however , these critical parameters are not well constrained by experiments , and hence there are large differences between predictions using different parameters .",
    "most of the existing experimental data for the @xmath4-process were measured in direct kinematics using stable isotope targets @xcite .",
    "however , a direct measurement on unstable nuclei is still a major challenge @xcite . in this work",
    ", we present a novel method using a heavy - ion storage ring developed to measure cross sections of low - energy nuclear reactions , e.g. , ( @xmath1 ) reactions , in inverse kinematics for nuclear astrophysics .",
    "this method offers some key advantages over traditional methods .",
    "it can efficiently use the beam and is well suited for measurements on unstable nuclei with half - lives longer than several minutes .",
    "this method was suggested already several decades ago @xcite .",
    "however , it was not realized until the latest achievements in producing , cooling , decelerating , and storing of heavy ions , as well as developments in the nuclear detection system at the experimental storage ring ( esr ) of gsi @xcite .",
    "this novel technique provides a unique condition for the direct measurement of ( @xmath1 ) reactions around the energy range of astrophysical interest @xcite and has been successfully demonstrated for the first time by measuring the @xmath0ru(@xmath1)@xmath2rh cross section between 9  mev / u and 11  mev / u .",
    "a preliminary data analysis at 11  mev / u has been reported in conference proceedings @xcite . here",
    "we report a full analysis with all corrections made .",
    "experimental results of the present work allow us to constrain the most important parameters in the hf model , and thus provide a reliable prediction for this reaction over a wide energy range .",
    "during this experiment , @xmath0ru ions from the linear accelerator ( unilac ) were first accelerated to 100  mev / u in the heavy - ion synchrotron ( sis ) and then stripped to the bare charge state of 44 + using a 11  mg/@xmath15 carbon stripper foil .",
    "the fully stripped ions were injected into the esr and slowed down to 9  mev / u , 10  mev / u and 11  mev / u , respectively , by ramping the magnetic fields and the frequency of the radio - frequency ( rf ) system synchronously . however , large beam losses occurred during this deceleration phase mainly due to imperfections of the ramping parameters .",
    "the @xmath0ru@xmath16 ions were cooled by the electron cooler before and after the slowing down phase to a small diameter ( about 5  mm ) and momentum spread ( around 10@xmath17 ) .",
    "after the final slowing down phase , about 5@xmath18@xmath19 @xmath0ru@xmath16 ions were stored in the esr with a lifetime of several hundred seconds when the hydrogen target was switched off .",
    "finally , a windowless hydrogen microdroplet target of high density @xcite was switched on and the decelerated @xmath0ru@xmath16 ions were focused onto this target for nuclear reactions .",
    "the great advantage of this storage ring method is that unreacted @xmath0ru@xmath16 ions were recycled and repeatedly impinged on the hydrogen target for reactions .",
    "considering the revolution frequency of about 400  khz for @xmath0ru@xmath16 ions circulating in the ring and the thickness of the h@xmath20 target of about @xmath21  particles/@xmath15 , a luminosity of about 2@xmath18@xmath22  /@xmath15/s has been achieved .    at about 10  mev / u ,",
    "the main reaction channels of @xmath0ru@xmath16 with the hydrogen target include the atomic electron capture ( ec ) reactions and different nuclear reactions .",
    "the former contain mainly two parts , namely the non - radiative electron capture ( nrc ) and the radiative electron capture ( rec ) accompanied by the emission of a photon .",
    "there are large uncertainties of about 30% according to ref .",

    "the detection efficiency of this ge detector was calibrated with mixed @xmath3-ray sources in the energy range between 10  kev and 140  kev . in the k - rec energy region , an intrinsic efficiency of",
    "about 88% has been reached for this detector with a solid angle ( @xmath25 ) of about 2.5@xmath18@xmath26  sr .",
    "the down - charged @xmath0ru ions ( @xmath0ru@xmath27 , @xmath0ru@xmath28 , @xmath0ru@xmath29 , etc . ) produced by ec were recorded by a position sensitive multi - wire proportional chamber ( mwpc ) @xcite mounted in the vacuum chamber of the first dipole magnet behind the target , as indicated in fig .",

    "this detector was operated with a mixture of argon , co@xmath20 and heptane ( 80:20:1.5 ) gas at standard atmospheric pressure in a pocket with a stainless - steel window .",
    "the detection efficiency of this detector is better than 99% for ions above @xmath3010 mev / u and a position resolution ( fwhm ) of 1.9  mm has been reached @xcite .",
    "however , a fraction of electron capture events were lost at the beam energy of 9  mev / u due to significant energy losses in the pocket window with a thickness of about 25  @xmath23 m and the gas with a thickness of around 24  mm before the mwpc .    at about 10 mev / u",

    "the above reaction products with different mass - over - charge ratios ( @xmath35 ) were separated by the magnetic field ( @xmath36 ) of the dipole magnet behind the target .",
    "for instance , the dispersion of the magnets displaced @xmath2rh@xmath37 from unreacted @xmath0ru@xmath16 by about 142  mm at the position of our detector , see dash - dotted line and solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp_setup_esr ] .",

    "therefore , orbits of the former are always on the outer side of the esr , see dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp_setup_esr ] , and bare nuclear reaction products on the inner side are not contaminated with atomic ones .",
    "the separated nuclear reaction products were detected by the position sensitive double - sided silicon strip detectors ( dsssds ) behind the quadrupole triplet magnets , as shown in fig .",

    "the strip pitch is 3.1  mm and the strip length is 49.5  mm .",
    "the dsssds were placed in a pocket separated from the vacuum of the esr by a 122@xmath1844  mm@xmath38 stainless - steel window with a thickness of about 25  @xmath23 m .",
    "the thickness of this window limited the reaction energy to above 9  mev / u in this experiment , since heavy ions with less energy would already be stopped in the window .",
    "recently , an improved detector omitting the window has been mounted @xcite , which will allow us to measure nuclear reactions around 5  mev / u in future experiments .",
    "for each beam energy setting , the dsssds were moved to two different positions along the @xmath39 direction , e.g. , 0  mm and 25  mm , to combine two measured spectra into a common @xmath39 position spectrum without any gap , see black points at 11  mev / u in fig .",

    "the present experimental results allowed us to pin down the @xmath3-ray strength function , which is a critical parameter in the hf model , as well as the nuclear level density model .",
    "after this , another important parameter , the proton potential , has also been constrained by combining our results with some additional data at lower energies .",
