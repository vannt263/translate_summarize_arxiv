    "since the first reports on pressure  induced amorphization ( pia ) , there has been an increasing interest in the phenomenon that has been observed in a large class of systems , both upon compression and decompression ( see ref . [ 1 ] for a review and references on particular materials ) .",
    "the experimental interest stems from the fact that pia occurs in some extremely widespread and important materials , namely water @xcite and quartz and its polymorphs @xcite , and also because pia provides a novel route to the synthesis of amorphous materials , in addition to the traditional technique of quenching from the melt .",
    "> from a basic point of view , there are controversies about the mechanism of pia and the nature of the amorphous phase , in particular regarding whether it is equivalent or not to the one obtained by quenching @xcite .",
    "since in most cases crystalline phases that undergo pia show reentrant melting in the @xmath0@xmath1 plane , it has been suggested @xcite that pia is nothing but melting at temperatures below the glass temperature of the supercooled fluid . other studies ( specially numerical ones @xcite ) have instead emphasized the relationship between pia and mechanical instabilities .",
    "it has been observed in fact , that in many cases pia is triggered by the softening of a shear phonon mode @xcite .",
    "in addition , some memory effects @xcite and anisotropic properties @xcite , although controversial @xcite , show that many times what appears to be an amorphous phase preserves within its structure signatures of the parent crystalline phase .    in view of",
    "the broad phenomenology briefly stated above , it is highly desirable to take advantage of model systems in which amorphization can be studied in a transparent way , allowing to look in detail into the mechanisms and characteristics of the transformation .",
    "this motivates the present work , in which we study a simple two  dimensional system of identical point  like particles interacting through a specially devised two  body potential .",
    "the simplicity of the model allows us to study large systems with some amount of defects , and observe directly the crucial role they play in the transformation .    in the model",
    "we study , there are a few different crystalline ground states depending on the applied pressure .",
    "we present here the results of the evolution of the most compact structure ( stable at the highest pressures ) upon pressure release @xcite .",
    "as we will see , pia at temperatures in which particle diffusion is negligible is always related to mechanical instabilities . for perfect lattices ,",
    "pia is reflected in the softening of a shear phonon mode .",
    "this leads to local distortions that produce the destabilization of new vibrational modes , leading to a cascade of instabilities @xcite , which drives the system toward an amorphous structure .",
    "however , in the presence of defects , _ localized _",
    "vibrational modes exist , that may become unstable before any extended vibrational mode does .",
    "this favors the nucleation of the amorphous phase at pressures much closer to the thermodynamic equilibrium value between the crystalline and amorphous phases .",
    "the work is divided as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the model .",
    "the results at zero temperature are contained in section iii . in section",
    "iv we give evidence that the disordered samples obtained can be called trully amorphous . in section",
    "v we present results at finite temperatures , and section vi contains some discussion and conclusions .",
    "an isotropic , purely repulsive interparticle potential is used , with a strict hard core at a distance @xmath2 plus an almost triangular repulsive shoulder .",
    "the pairwise interaction potential @xmath3 between two particles separated a distance @xmath4 is given by @xcite @xmath5 ^ 2   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\text { for } r_0<r < r_1\\\\ v(r)&=&0\\text {      for } r > r_1   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 , and @xmath2 sets the length unit .",
    "the potential is plotted in the inset of fig .",
    "this kind of potential has been previously used to systematize the anomalous properties of tetrahedrally coordinated materials @xcite .",
    "then we expect they are also appropriate to study amorphization under pressure , since this phenomenon occurs for most of these materials . its crucial characteristic is the existence of two possible equilibrium distances between particles .    the system is simulated by standard molecular dynamics in the nvt ensemble with periodic boundary conditions . at a given volume ,",
    "the quantities of interest are evaluated , and the volume is changed in steps of the order of @xmath7 by rescaling all coordinates of the particles and size of the simulation box .",
    "temperature is fixed by rescaling the velocities of the particles whenever necessary . as the amorphization process implies the existence of mechanical instabilities",
    ", we typically observe that kinetic energy tends to increase during amorphization . in a real situation",
    "this energy transforms into heat .",
    "here we simply eliminate it by the mentioned rescaling procedure .",
    "pressure is calculated by a direct evaluation in terms of the interparticle forces .",
    "we choose to model the system at constant volume in order to survey all regions of the volume  pressure curve , including those that would be unstable in constant pressure simulations .",
    "the results to be presented correspond to a two  dimensional system , to facilitate a direct visualization of the particle configurations .",
    "we should mention however , that the same phenomenology was observed in three ",
    "dimensional samples with the same interparticle potential .",
    "evolution of pressure @xmath0 upon increasing of the specific volume @xmath8 , at zero temperature .",
    "the thin continuous line is the expected evolution if the system remains always triangular .",
    "the dotted lines marks the ideal stability limit @xmath9 , at which a phonon energy vanishes .",
    "dots indicate results of simulation for a perfect lattice ( full circles ) , a lattice with a single vacancy ( stars ) and a system with grain boundaries ( open circles , see fig .",
    "letters correspond to snapshots in fig .",

    "we take as the starting configuration the one corresponding to the triangular lattice with lattice parameter @xmath10 , which is stable at high pressures . in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] we present the results of simulations at @xmath11 in a system of 2800 particles .",
    "the thin continuous line corresponds to the @xmath8@xmath0 relation assuming the system remains always triangular .",
    "the reentrance of this line is a consequence of the particular form of the interaction potential .",
    "the numerical results for a perfect lattice ( full circles ) follow this line up to some maximum volume , at which they abruptly depart from it .",
    "this is the pressure in which a phonon with vanishing energy first appears in the triangular structure ( see fig .",
    "analytical evaluation shows that this instability occurs when @xmath12 , where primes denotes derivatives of the potential , and @xmath13 is the lattice parameter .",
    "this expression is valid as long as the interaction between next nearest neighbors is zero , as it is in the present case . the critical volume @xmath14 and pressure @xmath15 are indicated by dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , and they are fully compatible with the numerical results .",
    "the unstable phonons turn out to be shear phonons with the wave vector @xmath16 oriented perpendicularly to one of the three most compact directions in the lattice .",
    "note that for the interparticle potential we use , the longitudinal phonon branch along these directions is of the type @xmath17 , and all shear phonons irrespective of the absolute value of @xmath18 become zero energy at the same point .",
    "then , in the present case the instability pressure is macroscopically signaled by the vanishing of the stress dependent shear modulus of the material @xcite , @xmath19 .",

    "upper four panels correspond to a perfect crystal starting sample , whereas the two lower ones are from a poly  crystalline sample with grain boundaries and vacancies .",
    ", width=321 ]    at @xmath14 there is a sharp and abrupt increase of pressure @xcite .",
    "snapshots of the particle configurations give clues of what happens in the system . in fig .",
    "[ f2](a ) we see the triangular configuration just before the instability . figure [ f2](b ) shows that after changing the volume a very small quantity , an instability has propagated in the system .",
    "we stress that the evolution of the system from the configuration in fig .",
    "[ f2](a ) to that in [ f2](b ) is triggered by a very small volume change , and is just the steepest descend evolution toward a local energy minimum of the energy landscape . in this evolution ,",
    "pressure recovers to a higher value indicated as @xmath20 ( dashed line ) in fig .",
    "this value is roughly maintained @xcite upon further volume increase up to @xmath21 , which is close to the volume at which the disordered regions have taken over the whole system .",
    "if volume is increased further , pressure decreases noticeably .",
    "the thermodynamic equilibrium pressure @xmath22 at @xmath11 between the crystalline and disordered structures is indicated by the arrow in fig .",
    "the value of @xmath22 was calculated by enthalpy evaluations of the triangular lattice and the amorphous structure obtained by quenching from the melt .",
    "thus , @xmath22 represents the natural extrapolation of the melting line to zero temperature .",
    "we see that @xmath22 is close to ( though a bit higher than ) @xmath20 .",
    "it must be noticed that constant pressure simulations would have shown at @xmath15 an abrupt transition between a completely ordered and a completely disordered system , while @xmath20 would have remained hidden .",
    "however , @xmath23 has a clear physical meaning as the transition pressure _ once the disordered phase has been nucleated_. this suggests that if nucleation centers are present in the system , @xmath23 will be experimentally accessible as the actual transition pressure .",
    "in fact , fig .",
    "[ f1 ] shows also the @xmath8@xmath0 evolution for a system with a single vacancy and for a system with grain boundaries . in the former case ,",
    "the instability occurs before @xmath14 is reached , and in the latter case it even occurs without any pressure reentrance @xcite .",
    "note that the three curves tend to coincide after the first destabilization of the original lattice .",
    "two snapshots of the system for the poly  crystalline case [ fig . [ f2](e ) and ( f ) ] show how the disordered phase grows from grain boundaries , that provide nucleation centers for the transformation .",
    "these results are a clear indication that defects are very effective in lowering the energy barrier for the transition , and also explain why , in experiments , transformation pressures close to the thermodynamic values are usually observed .",
    "the lowering of the energy barrier due to defects and its relation to thermodynamic melting has been discussed by mizushima _",
    "@xcite in the context of crystal  crystal pressure  induced transformations . note that in the case in which the transformation is triggered by defects , the phonon spectrum of the system ( and in particular the elastic constants ) gives no indication of the instability that is about to occur .",
    "this is particularly obvious in the case of a single vacancy : a single defect can not modify the phonon spectrum of an infinite sample , and then its effect it is not seen in the elastic constants , but it produces a finite change in the value of the critical pressure @xmath15@xcite .",
    "it was already mentioned that for the interaction potential used , the whole branch of shear phonons become zero energy at @xmath15 .",
    "we want to emphasize however that amorphization it is not related to this degeneracy , as it can also be triggered by a single phonon becoming unstable . in fact , we did simulations with a modified potential in which an attractive term @xmath24 reaching up to second nearest neighbors was included . the actual potential used is the one of the previous section plus an attractive term given by @xmath25   \\nonumber \\\\ * & & \\text { for } \\left(r_1 + 2r_0\\right)/2<r<2r_0 .",
    "\\label{uat}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the instability corresponds now to the vanishing of the energy of edge zone shear phonons only , as indicated in fig .",
    "the amorphization of the system occurs precisely at the point where this phonon becomes zero energy , and it was observed to be similar to the previous case where the full shear phonon branch becomes unstable at the same pressure .",
    "this rules out an amorphization mechanism in which at the instability , arbitrary combinations of the unstable phonons generate disordered movements of the atoms , and favors a cascade mechanism as described in the discussion section below .",
    "the claim that the disordered structure we obtain upon decompression is really amorphous is supported by the following facts .",
    "we find no evidence of orientational order in the structure factor @xmath26 , even in the case in which we start with a mono  crystalline sample .",
    "moreover , a quantitative comparison with the structure factor of a system quenched from the liquid ( prototypic of an amorphous sample ) shows that they are indistinguishable ( fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) . in addition , we have failed to find any single systematic difference between the two amorphous .",
    "if temperature is not strictly zero , even the perfect lattice amorphizes before the ultimate mechanical instability limit is reached .",
    "simulations at finite temperature with perfect samples show that the amorphization occurs at a temperature dependent critical pressure @xmath27 ( such that @xmath28 ) . the temperature dependence of the critical pressure originates in the fact that a thermally activated process may destabilize the soft phonon before it actually becomes zero energy .",
    "it is instructive to see in some more detail how this destabilization occurs .",
    "consider the normal modes ( phonons ) of the system .",
    "we will study the case in which only a single phonon with wave vector @xmath16 perpendicular to one of the high density planes has non - zero amplitude .",
    "we expand the energy of the lattice in powers of the amplitude of the phonon oscillation , going one order beyond the harmonic approximation .",
    "let us call @xmath29 and @xmath30 the longitudinal and transversal oscillation amplitude of that phonon .",
    "as we will see there is a nontrivial coupling between the two at the instability .    taking into account that our potential produces interactions only among first neighbors in the lattice , the energy per particle @xmath31 of the system up to third order in the amplitudes can be written after some lengthy but straightforward calculation as    @xmath32 \\\\ & & + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{8}\\sin^3\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}ka}{4}\\right ) \\left [ \\delta_t^2 \\delta_l   \\left(-\\frac{4v'}{a^2}+\\frac{v''}{a}+v'''\\right)\\right ] .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the first line in ( [ e0 ] ) is the harmonic contribution , the second is a cubic term in the displacements ( there is an additional cubic term proportional to @xmath33 , but this can be shown to be not relevant for the analysis below ) .",
    "the system becomes unstable when the coefficient of @xmath34 vanishes , providing again the condition @xmath35 , which defines the @xmath11 values @xmath15 and @xmath14 .",
    "close enough to this instability point , @xmath36 is proportional to @xmath37 and to lowest order all other coefficients can be considered to be constants . then generically , the energy can be written as    @xmath38 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sin^3\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}ka}{4}\\right ) \\left[d\\delta_t^2",
    "\\delta_l   \\right ] .",
    "\\label{dos}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the existence of a @xmath39 term is very important , as it indicates that for @xmath0 slightly larger than @xmath15 there is a saddle point ( actually two , one with positive and the other with negative @xmath30 ) close to @xmath40 , @xmath41 , than can be determined requiring stationarity of ( [ dos ] ) .",
    "the result is    @xmath42    where the upperscript indicates the values at the saddle .",
    "if the system reaches this saddle it can escape from the local minimum at the origin , namely , the system destabilizes .",
    "the energy barrier @xmath43 for this process is obtained by reinserting ( [ tres ] ) into ( [ dos ] ) .",
    "the result is : @xmath44 note that the barrier is exactly the same whatever the wave vector of the phonon considered ( this is no longer true if further neighbors interactions are included , but the possibility to escape through the jump of a barrier remains ) . the instability mechanism is then driven by the @xmath39 term in the energy , what implies a not trivial coupling of transverse modes ( the one actually having vanishing frequency ) and longitudinal ones . at finite temperatures",
    "the barrier @xmath43 can be surmounted .",
    "nucleation theory tells that escape time @xmath45 is proportional to @xmath46 . assuming the preexponential factor is a constant @xmath47 ( this is certainly not true , but dependences on @xmath47 become weak in the final result ) we obtain that if a time @xmath48 is given , the system will overcame the energy barrier if @xmath49 , and from here we obtain the formula for the temperature necessary to escape a given barrier , namely : @xmath50 for practical purposes the logarithmic factor can be usually taken to be approximately 0.1 . as @xmath51",
    ", we obtain that the critical pressure @xmath27 increases as @xmath52 at finite temperatures , a behavior that is well reproduced in the simulations ( fig .",
    "the @xmath27 line is then the pressure amorphization line for a sample without defects , and can be properly interpreted as the ` mechanical melting ' line of this system . in the absence of defects it marks",
    "the limit on which the crystalline phase destabilizes ( purely mechanically at @xmath11 , and by a thermally activated process at @xmath53 ) .",
    "note however , that the elastic constants of the system , in particular the shear modulus @xmath54 , do not extrapolate to zero at @xmath27 , except at @xmath11 ( see fig .",
    "in fact , the numerical evaluation by means of fluctuation formulas @xcite shows that the effect of temperature in the elastic constants is very small . at @xmath11",
    "the stress dependent shear modulus @xmath54 vanishes at @xmath15 , as we already knew from the phonon dispersion relation , but at @xmath53 extrapolation is consistent with a vanishing of @xmath54 very close to @xmath15 , and certainly not at @xmath27 .",
    "the thermally activated process that at finite temperatures leads to the instability at the higher pressure @xmath27 is a rare event that it is enough to occur once to completely destabilize the system .",
    "this process is not captured in the value of the elastic constants .    up to here the results for samples without defects . for defective samples the amorphization line @xmath55 is only weakly dependent on @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , it is very close to the extrapolation of the melting line obtained from simulations at higher temperatures ( see fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ) . @xmath55 and @xmath27 are well different from each other , particularly at very low temperatures .",
    "defects are responsible for this difference , and provide the link between the ` mechanical ' and ` thermodynamical ' scenarios for pressure amorphization .",
    "the experimental observation that in some materials pia occurs roughly along the extrapolated melting line has motivated the suggestion @xcite that ` thermodynamic melting ' is the underlying driving force for amorphization .",
    "our results show that amorphization at zero temperature is always a phenomenon related to mechanical instabilities . in perfect lattices ,",
    "mechanical instabilities reflect necessarily in the phonon spectrum of the material , and amorphization can be easily related to a mechanical process . however , for defective lattices , the mechanical instability that triggers amorphization is associated with localized vibrational modes around defects , and this instability occurs typically without any noticeably signature in the phonon spectrum , i.e. , the mechanical nature of the process is more subtle .",
    "we emphasize that a single defect is sufficient to trigger the amorphization of a whole macroscopic sample@xcite .",
    "how this first instability is able to transform the highly ordered original lattice into a fully amorphous configuration is not easy to understand , specially considering that this evolution is fully deterministic from a mechanical point of view , and can be described as the steepest descendant path of the configuration point of the system onto its energy landscape .",
    "a deep understanding of this process will surely shed light also onto the very definition of what an amorphous material is , typically characterized by what it lacks , instead of what it possesses .",
    "here we make only the following considerations @xcite .",
    "the first instability of the lattice ( at @xmath11 ) can always be described as the vanishing of the frequency of one of the normal modes of the system .",
    "this normal mode may be a phonon for a perfect lattice , or a localized mode for a defective lattice .",
    "when the coordinate characterizing the destabilizing mode grows , it typically goes beyond the applicability limit of the linear theory , and the whole mechanical stability of the system has to be reanalyzed . then , although the analysis of section [ v ] is appropriate to determine the barrier for the system to scape from its metastable equilibrium , it can not be continued when the system actually overcomes the saddle without including the interaction with other modes .",
    "for instance , it occurs in our system that once the coordinate of the unstable phonon starts to increase , it couples to other phonons and the results is that a shuffle of two pieces of the material develops . in this way",
    ", the instability generated by an extended object ( the unstable phonon ) produced a localized ( one  dimensional ) defect on the lattice.@xcite .",
    "but it turns out that , in the present case , the new configuration of the lattice is not stable either , and a new distortion occurs spatially close to the region already distorted ( see fig .",
    "[ f7 ] ) . in the present case of amorphization ,",
    "it is likely that a cascade of these processes occurs that leads to an amorphous structure .",
    "the spatially localized nature of the process reflects in the fact that for partially transformed samples , transformed and untransformed regions are spatially separated , as seen in fig .",
    "we however emphasize that another possibility could be that after the first phonon instability and the first shuffle , the system reaches a mechanically stable configuration , then further increases of the volume will produce independent shuffles in the samples , along the three directions related by symmetry . if this is the case , then this single phonon will drive a transformation ( which has the character of a martensitic transformation ) to a new ( poly)crystalline phase .",
    "this and other intermediate cases , that in our model occur for different parameters , will be discussed separately .",
    "in summary , we have arrived at a picture of the mechanism of pia , reconciling mechanical and thermodynamical melting in a unifying scheme .",
    "the present model exhibits a one  step crystal  to  amorphous transition to a truly amorphous state that does not differ from the disordered structure obtained by quenching from the melt .",
    "once the transformation is triggered , it is followed by a cascade process that produces the amorphous structure . for a perfect lattice , and vanishingly small temperatures ,",
    "the transformation takes place through a shear phonon instability at a pressure far apart the thermodynamical equilibrium pressure . for defective lattices",
    ", the mechanical instability shows up by the destabilization of localized vibrational modes , close to the thermodynamical equilibrium pressure . in either case , the transformation is always triggered by mechanical instabilities .",
    "temperature can produce the transition to occur before the mechanical stability limit is reached , due to a process of thermally activated jump over a barrier . in real samples with appropriate defects , experimental transition pressures will be seen close to the extrapolation of the melting line .",
    "these facts reconcile different claims in the literature regarding the nature of the pia of materials .",
    "we remark that , although we presented results for a two  dimensional model system , preliminary results in three ",
    "dimensional samples qualitatively agree with the phenomenology stated above , and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "we finally stress that these considerations have potential applications in the study of melting mechanisms of crystalline materials@xcite .",

    "<S> we study numerically an atomistic model which is shown to exhibit a one  step crystal  to  amorphous transition upon decompression . the amorphous phase can not be distinguished from the one obtained by quenching from the melt . for a perfectly crystalline starting sample , </S>",
    "<S> the transition occurs at a pressure at which a shear phonon mode destabilizes , and triggers a cascade process leading to the amorphous state . when defects are present , the nucleation barrier is greatly reduced and the transformation occurs very close to the extrapolation of the melting line to low temperatures . in this last case , </S>",
