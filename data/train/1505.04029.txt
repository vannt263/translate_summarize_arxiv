    "global warming attributed to anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases is one of the major challenges facing mankind .",
    "carbon capture and storage ( or co@xmath0 sequestration ) in underground aquifers is detected as a promising mean to restrict unwanted rise of greenhouse gas level in the atmosphere .",
    "geological sequestration of disposal in deep saline aquifers offers several key assets of miscible fingering instabilities driven by both viscous and buoyancy forces . at a subsurface saline aquifer site",
    "the injected super - critical lighter co@xmath0 rises up and accumulates under an impervious rock , followed by dissolution of co@xmath0 into the underlying brine .",
    "an unstably stratified diffusive interface of heavier co@xmath0 dissolved brine is formed above the pure brine and transition to natural convection in the form of unstable sinking plumes is featured in time .",
    "several theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies are conducted to understand the convective instabilities devoted to characterising optimal storage sites that ensure co@xmath0 does not leak into the environment . in such convective flows , viscosity variation , albeit small , at the diffusive interface influences the onset of instability and hence plays significant role in characterising the storage sites . despite having enormous importance in real life applications",

    "these authors showed , through an lsa , that in the absence of displacement the onset time increases when the dynamic viscosity increases with the depth . on the other hand , when the more viscous fluid displaces the less viscous one from above the onset time depends non - monotonically on the viscosity contrast between the two fluids . in both these studies lsa",
    "was performed under a quasi - steady state approximation , which has its own drawback , since it does not capture possible transient growth of the linearly unstable modes and hence fails to predict the onset of instability accurately . for flows with unsteady base - state , transient growth of the perturbations is possible in hydrodynamic stability problems driven solely by buoyancy force @xcite or viscous force @xcite .",
    "discussion of the above - mentioned literature reveals that transient growth plays important role on the onset of instability .",
