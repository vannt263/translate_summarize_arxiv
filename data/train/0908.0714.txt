    "x - ray binaries are x - ray emitting systems composed of a compact object , either a neutron star or a black hole , and a stellar companion .",
    "the accretion of matter from the companion star onto the compact object is mostly responsible for the x - ray emission , although some are powered by the fast rotation of the neutron star .",
    "these systems can be subdivided in two groups : high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb ) and low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) .",
    "the first group includes systems in which the companion is a massive star and where the mass transfer is due to the decretion disk of the donor star , by strong stellar wind or roche - lobe overflow .",
    "they are bright persistent x - ray emitters and show significant variability .",
    "the second group is composed of systems containing a companion star of low mass and where the mass transfer occurs via roche - lobe overflow . most of them are x - ray transients .",
    "an interesting feature of some x - ray binaries ( hmxbs and lmxbs ) is the presence of relativistic jets ; these systems are classified as microquasars .",
    "+ the detection of tev emission from psr b1259 - 63 @xcite , ls 5039 @xcite and ls i + 61 303 @xcite has validated that efficient particle acceleration occurs in binary systems .",
    "these three objects have high - mass o or b star companions , eccentric orbits and they have all been detected in the radio ( which is not common for hmxbs ) .",
    "the emission seems to be modulated with the orbital periods of the binary systems . in psr b1259 - 63 ,",
    "the maximum gamma - ray flux is observed near periastron ; for ls 5039 , it is at inferior conjunction and for ls i + 61 303 , it is near apastron .",
    "+ two different models have been proposed to explain the tev emission in these objects . in the first model ,",
    "the emission is powered by the interaction between the pulsar wind and the stellar wind .",
    "particles are accelerated at the shock between the winds @xcite . in the second model , which applies to the microquasar scenario ,",
    "particles are accelerated in the jets @xcite . for both models ,",
    "the accelerated particles can be protons or electrons .",
    "the very - high - energy ( vhe ) gamma - rays are produced ( in the hadronic model ) by the decay of neutral pions , or ( in the leptonic model ) by inverse compton up - scattering of stellar uv photons from the companion star by the relativistic electrons .",
    "the model of the shock - powered emission from the pulsar wind interaction is consistent with psr b1259 - 63 observations , whereas the cases of ls 5039 or ls i + 61 303 are still unclear , mainly due to the fact that the nature of the compact objects is unknown .",
    "therefore , both models described above are plausible to explain the tev emission .",
    "the magic collaboration has reported evidence of vhe gamma - ray emission from the microquasar cygnus x-1 @xcite . if the detection is confirmed , the validity of the microquasar model would be unambiguously demonstrated .",
    "+ x - ray binaries are intriguing systems . from the three confirmed detections of vhe gamma - ray emission ( psr b1259 - 63 , ls 5039 and",
    "ls i + 61 303 ) , it is clear that each system is unique .",
    "the fact that the maximum emission flux does not occur at the same orbital phase and that a correlation with the x - ray emission is not present in all three systems makes it difficult to predict when to observe these objects in the tev range .",
    "moreover , mechanisms involved in the vhe gamma - ray production could be initiated or enhanced during intense x - ray flares .",
    "magnetic fields could also play a role in the production of vhe emission .",
    "some authors predict detectable tev emission from binaries formed by a be star and a highly magnetised neutron star during a major x - ray outburst @xcite .",
    "finally , the gamma - ray binary scenario might resolve the unidentified nature of some tev sources , in particular hess j0632 + 057 @xcite .",
