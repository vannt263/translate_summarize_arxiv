    "two sorts of small perturbations of black holes within general relativity are considered usually : the first consists in adding of a test field to a black hole space - time and thus can be described by a dynamical equation for this field in the background of a black hole .",
    "second way to perturb a black hole is to perturb the metric itself . in this case in order to find the evolution equation one has to linearize the einstein equations .",
    "these perturbations are called gravitational perturbations and are always paid more attention than the first ones .",
    "that is because gravitational radiation is much stronger than that of the external fields decaying near the black hole , and also the metric perturbations let us judge about stability of a black hole .    in four space - time dimensions the linearized einstein equations for perturbations of schwarzschild black hole can be treated separately for axial ( invariant under the change @xmath2 ) and polar perturbations . after the separation of angular variables and supposing exponential dependence of the wave function on time ( @xmath3 ) , the final radial wave equations for these two kinds of perturbations have the form of the schrodinger wave - like equations with some different effective potentials @xmath4 where the index @xmath5 designates a type of perturbations .",
    "it is a remarkable point that the spectra produced by these two potentials for @xmath1 schwarzschild black hole are the same .",
    "what occurs for higher dimensional black hole was the challenge up until now , when ishibashi and kodama @xcite , @xcite , @xcite managed to reduce the perturbation equations to three wave - like equations , one for each type of perturbations : scalar ( reducing to polar at @xmath1 ) , vector ( reducing to axial at @xmath1 ) , and `` new '' tensor perturbations .",
    "such a reduction of the linearized einstein equations to the wave - like form is not trivial work and requires decomposition of the wave functions into the corresponding harmonics which are connected with the symmetry of the background to be perturbed ( see for example references in @xcite ) .",
    "the metric of the spherically symmetric charged static black hole in a d - dimensional space - time with @xmath0 term has the form : @xmath6 where @xmath7 the effective potentials for scalar , vector , and tensor , gravitational perturbations respectively have the form : @xmath8 where @xmath9 @xmath10\\lambda r^{2}+\\ ] ] @xmath11 @xmath12 x^{2 } + 4 d [ d^2 ( 4 d^3 + 5 d^2 -10 d + 4 ) z^2 -\\ ] ] @xmath13 @xmath14 x - 4 d^5   ( 3 d - 2 ) z^3 + 12 d^2 ( 2 ( -6 d + 3 d^2 + 4 ) m+\\ ] ] @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20    the effective potential for tensor perturbations proved to be equivalent to that corresponding to decay of test scalar field in a black hole background @xcite,@xcite . when @xmath21 @xmath22 one has d - dimensional sds ( sads ) background .",
    "note that the scalar - type perturbation equations for charged background together with the corresponding maxwell equations can be reduced to the pair of equations for electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations ( see eqs .",
    "( 5.59 ) - ( 5.63 ) of @xcite ) , which we shall not write out here , since they are cumbersome .",
    "when perturbing a black hole , its response has resonances at some complex discrete modes . if one denote the general solution at infinity as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the tortoise coordinate ( @xmath25 ) , @xmath26 @xmath27 are radial solutions corresponding to incoming and outgoing radiation at infinity with some complex amplitudes @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "then the reflection coefficient @xmath30 is singular at the resonance frequencies",
    ". therefore one can think that @xmath28 vanishes under the non - vanishing @xmath29 , i.e. no incoming radiation is permitted at spacial infinity . since no outgoing radiation can escape the horizon of a black hole , the modes are required to represent purely in - going waves at the horizon .",
    "thus under the choice of positive sign of the real part of @xmath31 , @xmath32 , ( @xmath3 ) the resonance ( quasinormal ) modes satisfy the boundary conditions : @xmath33 it is important that the quasinormal modes dominate during late - time stages of the gravitational response of a black hole to an external perturbation .",
    "this response consists of damping oscillations and is called quasinormal ringing .",
    "note that the quasinormal modes do not depend on way in which they where excited and are determined by a black hole parameters only .",
    "being calculated within the linear approximation of metric perturbations , the existence of quasinormal modes are confirmed in a non - linear analysis .",
    "they are important characteristic values of various dynamic processes , such as black hole collisions or decay of different fields in a bh background .",
    "in addition it has been revealed recently that the quasinormal modes calculated in ads gravity have a direct interpretation in the dual gauge theory @xcite and , also , help to predict the correct value of a black hole entropy in loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "al this stimulated considerable interest in qnms ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) . at the same time the higher dimensional brane models @xcite , created new motivations to calculate quasinormal modes of the higher - dimensional black holes @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus within different contexts the quasinormal modes corresponding to decay of a free scalar field around the higher dimensional ( @xmath34 ) black holes have been considered recently in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we are interested here in calculating of the quasinormal modes of the d - dimensional s , sds and sads black holes for gravitational perturbations .",
    "in sec.ii we calculate the qnms of @xmath34 sbh . in sec.iii",
    "the case of non - vanishing @xmath35 - term is investigating ; this includes black holes in de - sitter and anti - de - sitter space - times .",
    "iv is devoted to the effect of the black hole charge on the qn ringing .",
    "the effective potentials for vector and tensor potentials for schwarzschild black holes ( see formulas ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) at @xmath36 ) is constant at the infinity and at the horizon , and approach a maximum somewhere in between ( see @xcite for plots of the effective potentials ) .",
    "together with the boundary conditions ( [ 4 ] ) this allows us to use the standard wkb approach of schutz and will @xcite which have been recently extended to the 6th order @xcite .",
    "another case is the scalar - gravitational potential ( [ 4 ] ) which has negative pitch near the event horizon for some values of the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "thus when analyzing this particular type of gravitational perturbations we shall be restricted by those values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 for which we have good potential barrier for @xmath39 .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the real part of quasinormal modes corresponding to decay of the free scalar field around the d - dimensional schwarzschild black hole are roughly proportional to @xmath37 if measured in units @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the horizon radius , and for moderate and large @xmath37 this numerical linear dependence is very accurate .",
    "these qnms of free scalar field coincide completely with those of the tesor - type gravitational perturbations , which is naturally , since the effective potentials of these two perturbations are equivalent . to compute the qnms we used the 6th order wkb formula @xcite : @xmath42 where the correction terms of the i - th wkb order @xmath43 can be found in @xcite and @xcite , @xmath44 and @xmath45 means the i - th derivative of @xmath46 at its maximum .",
    "the fundamental modes for vector and tensor @xmath47 potentials are presented in table 1 ( the scalar potential for @xmath47 has negative pitch in higher dimensions ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table iii .",
    "the fundamental quasinormal frequencies , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 4-dimensional rn black hole ; @xmath50 is near extremal value of @xmath46 at which the qn mode converge to some its limiting value . the numerical results for this limiting value is taken from the paper of h.onozawa et .",
    "al . @xcite .",
    "we have been studied the gravitational quasinormal frequencies for higher dimensional s , sds , and sads black holes . the quasinormal behavior crucially different in these three cases : for @xmath51 the quasinormal modes are inversely proportional to the black hole size ( the horizon radius ) , the presence of @xmath52 leads to decreasing of the real oscillation frequency and to increasing of the damping time .",
    "the presence of @xmath53 lead to totally different behavior : the quasinormal modes of large and intermediate ads black holes are proportional to the black hole size ( and thereby proportional to the temperature in this regime ) , and goes to pure ads limit when the radius of the event horizon goes to zero @xcite . in all these points the higher dimensional gravitational modes mimic the behavior of the four dimensional modes .",
    "different features in quasinormal behavior of the higher dimensional black holes is connected with existence of the three types of perturbations : scalar , vector and tensor types of gravitational modes .",
    "these three types of perturbations excite three different spectra of quasinormal modes . in particular , the more the spin weight of the corresponding harmonics in which the perturbations are expanded , the greater the real oscillation frequencies and the greater the damping rate .",
    "thus that is the scalar - type modes which damp most slowly and thereby must dominate at later stages of quasinormal ringing . and this is the case of charged background , and also asymptotically de - sitter or anti - de - sitter backgrounds .",
    "all found here modes are damping what supports the stability of the above black holes .",
    "unfortunately , with the help of existent semi - analytical methods , we are not able to find the quasinormal modes of scalar - type gravitational perturbations for a full range of parameters , since the corresponding effective potentials have negative pitch near the black hole horizon . nevertheless in some of these cases ( such as the case of large @xmath37 ) one can anticipate the quasinormal behavior .",
    "another interesting step in the direction of investingating of gravitational radiation from higher dimensional black holes is the considering the quantum effects such as hawking radiation ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
