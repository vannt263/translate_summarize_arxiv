    "the extension of general relativity to higher dimensions was motivated in part by studies of the early universe . while it is generally believed that in the present universe the extra spatial dimensions have become compactified , their very existence has led to many investigations in various areas .",
    "rahaman et al .",
    "@xcite investigated whether the usual solar system tests are compatible with the existence of higher spatial dimensions .",
    "other studies involved the motion of test particles @xcite , solar - system effects in a scharzschild - de sitter spacetime @xcite , as well as numerous other phenomena @xcite .",
    "many studies assume only one extra spatial dimension when discussing higher - dimensional cases @xcite . in this regard",
    "we would like to have a special mention of some of our recent works @xcite .",
    "ray @xcite has considered static spherically symmetric charged dust corresponding to @xmath0 dimensional einstein - maxwell spacetime and shown that for @xmath1 , the expression for gravitational mass corresponds to the mass given by bonnor @xcite and cohen and cohen @xcite which , in turn , confirms the identification of mass as the fifth dimension by ponce de leon @xcite . in the later work",
    ", kuhfittig @xcite assumes that the @xmath2-brane is a de sitter space and there is only one extra spatial dimension , assumed to be time dependent .",
    "it is proposed in this work that the cosmological inflation of the @xmath2-brane may provide a possible explanation for the collapse of the extra dimension , as well as for the energy stored in the resulting curled - up dimension .",
    "an important outcome of string theory ( which assumes extra dimensions ) is the notion that coordinates may become noncommutative operators in a @xmath3-brane @xcite .",
    "the consequence is a fundamental discretization of spacetime due to the commutator @xmath4=i\\theta^{\\mu\\nu}$ ] , where @xmath5 is an antisymmetric matrix , similar to the way that the planck constant @xmath6 discretizes phase space @xcite .",
    "this noncommutative geometry is an intrinsic property of spacetime that does not depend on particular features such as curvature .",
    "moreover , it was pointed out in ref . @xcite that noncommutativity replaces point - like structures by smeared objects , thereby eliminating the divergences that normally appear in general relativity .",
    "this smearing can be modeled by the use of the gaussian distribution of minimal length @xmath7 instead of the dirac delta function .",
    "so the energy density of the static and spherically symmetric smeared and particle - like gravitational source has the form @xcite @xmath8 the mass @xmath9 could be a diffused centralized object such as a wormhole @xcite .",
    "the gaussian source has also been used by sushkov @xcite to model phantom - energy supported wormholes , as well as by nicolini and spalluci @xcite for the purpose of modelling the physical effects of short - distance fluctuations of noncommutative coordinates in the study of black holes .",
    "galactic rotation curves inspired by a noncommutative - geometry background are discussed in one of our very recent works @xcite .",
    "the stability of a particular class of thin - shell wormholes in noncommutative geometry is analyzed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "therefore , the purpose of this paper is to obtain wormhole solutions within the framework of noncommutative geometry , first by assuming the usual four dimensions in general relativity and then by adding one extra spatial dimension .",
    "it was subsequently discovered , however , that for dimensions above five , no wormhole solutions exist , pointing out the danger of assuming only one extra spatial dimension .",
    "to describe a spherically symmetric wormhole spacetime in higher dimension , we take the metric to be @xmath10 where the line element @xmath11 on the unit @xmath12-sphere is given by @xmath13    the most general energy momentum tensor compatible with static spherically symmetry is @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",

    "we are going to assume a constant redshift function for our model , the so - called zero - tidal force solution @xcite , to make the wormhole traversable by humanoid travelers .",
    "in other words , we have @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a constant .    using eq .",
    "( [ e : redshift ] ) , we can rewrite the field equations ( [ e : einstein1])-([e : einstein3 ] ) in terms of the shape function @xmath22 , where @xmath23 :    @xmath24    @xmath25    @xmath26    from eq .",
    "( [ e : rho ] ) , we get the following solution for the shape function :    @xmath27}{(n+3)\\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right ) }     \\\\+ \\frac{16 \\pi } { n r^{n-2}(4 \\pi \\theta)^{(n+1)/2 } } \\frac{\\left [ 2^{(3-n)/2 } r^{n-1}\\left ( \\frac{1}{\\theta}\\right)^{(n-1)/2 } \\left ( \\frac{r^2}{\\theta}\\right)^{-(n+1)/4}{exp}\\left({-\\frac{r^2 } { 8\\theta}}\\right)m_{w } \\left ( \\frac{n+5}{4},\\frac{n+3}{4 } , \\frac{r^2}{4\\theta } \\right ) \\right]}{\\frac{n+1}{2}}~~ + ~~ \\frac{c}{r^{n-2}}$ ] @xmath28    where @xmath29 is an integration constant and the whittaker mass @xmath30 can be defined as @xmath31 , [ 1 + 2\\nu ] , z \\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this solution is obviously very difficult to deal with . in the following subsections",
    "we will therefore discuss various cases for specific dimensions .",
    "however , @xmath29 being an integration constant , mathematically , @xmath22 is a solution for every values of @xmath29 .",
    "the flare - out condition , on the other hand , is a physical requirement that is satisfied only for a certain range of values of @xmath29 , which , in turn , depend on the other parameters . because of the complexity of the shape function",
    ", we will use a graphical approach to analyze the wormhole structure , including the location of the throat , in terms of typical values of the parameters . in this manner",
    "it is shown that wormhole solutions exist in four and five dimensions only .",
    "the higher - dimensional cases require some additional discussion and will be dealt with in the later phase .",

    "to do so , we need to assign some typical values to the parameters , an example of which is shown in fig .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "2 that @xmath36 as @xmath37 , so that in conjunction with the constant redshift function , the spacetime is asymptotically flat .",
    "the throat of the wormhole is located at @xmath38 , where @xmath39 cuts the @xmath40-axis , shown in fig .",
    "3 .    fig .",
    "3 also indicates that for @xmath41 , @xmath42 , i.e. , @xmath43 , which implies that @xmath44 for @xmath41 , an essential requirement for a shape function .",
    "moreover , @xmath45 is a decreasing function for @xmath46 . since @xmath47",
    ", we have @xmath48 , which is the flare - out condition .",
    "with this condition now satisfied , the shape function has produced the desired wormhole structure . for completeness",
    "let us note that for the given parameters , @xmath49 to four decimal places with @xmath50 , obtained from eq .",
    "( [ e : rho ] ) .",
    "the close connection between the flare - out condition and the energy conditions calls for a check on the latter . according to fig .",

    "5 that @xmath57 at some point .",
    "more precisely , for the particular parameters chosen , @xmath58 to four decimal places .",
    "this is in agreement with fig .",
    "6 , which shows @xmath45 intersecting the @xmath40-axis at @xmath38 .",
    "also , from eq .",
    "( [ e : rho ] ) , @xmath59 .",
    "the function continues to increase to the right of @xmath60 ; its slope and is still positive at @xmath61 but soon becomes negative .",
    "so we have a valid solution around the throat .",
    "moreover , @xmath61 is a convenient cut - off for the wormhole material and subsequent junction to the corresponding external schwarzschild spacetime @xmath62 here @xmath63 is related to the mass @xmath64 of the five dimensional schwarzschild black hole as @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , for the present case it can be evaluated as @xmath66 , while @xmath67 , so that @xmath68 .",
    "this yields the respective interior and exterior line elements : @xmath69 for @xmath70 and @xmath71 for @xmath72 .",
    "( due to the spherical symmetry , the remaining components are already continuous @xcite ) .",
    "observe that only the interior solution retains the zero tidal forces .",
    "one can note that here the junction is a thin shell .",
    "since the shell is infinitely thin , the radial pressure is zero . according to the darmois - israel junction condition @xcite ,",
    "the surface density is also zero , however , the tangential pressure is nonzero ( see ref .",

    "7 indicates that only the nec is satisfied , while the wec and sec are violated .",

    "9 locates the presumptive throat of the wormhole and fig .",
    "8 shows the shape function @xmath22 .",

    "10 ) . for @xmath76 , we get @xmath83\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    so it appears that there are no wormhole solutions for dimensions above five as @xmath22 contains the factor @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) which causes @xmath22 to be a monotonic decreasing function .",
    "the reason is that both @xmath86 and @xmath87 level off rapidly in the outward radial direction . as a result , @xmath88 is completely dominated by @xmath89 for larger @xmath12 and proper choice of @xmath29 .",
    "so one would expect the slope of @xmath22 to become even steeper with increasing @xmath12 , which is clearly born out in figs",

    "the steepness can only increase further as @xmath12 increases . for smaller",
    "@xmath12 , this dominance does not necessarily hold .",
    "thus , according to fig . 5 , for @xmath53 and proper choice of @xmath29 , the term @xmath90 allows @xmath22 to increase long enough to yield an interior solution .",

    "we obtain two wormhole solutions within the framework of this extended noncommutative geometry . in general , the primary ingredient for sustaining traversable wormholes is the presence of exotic matter that violates the null energy condition .",
    "however , we have proposed a set of new wormhole solutions within the framework of noncommutative geometry background , where the matter satisfies the null energy condition ( nec ) but violates the weak energy condition ( wec ) and strong energy condition ( sec ) .",
    "it is shown that wormhole solutions exists in the usual four , as well as in five dimensions , but they do not exist in six or seven dimensions , suggesting that such solutions do not exist beyond five dimensions .",

    "this assumption simplified the mathematical calculations , but it also provided sufficiently exciting exact solutions .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention here that the wormhole in four dimensional spacetime is asymptotically flat whereas in five dimension it is asymptotically non - flat and for higher than five dimensions no wormhole exists .",
