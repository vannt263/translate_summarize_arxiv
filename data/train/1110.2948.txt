    "in recent studies of random matrix theory ( rmt ) there has been an interest in a family of ensembles which at the same time generalizes the standard wigner gaussian ensemble and preserves its invariance under unitary transformations@xcite .",

    "nevertheless , it has been claimed@xcite that , under certain conditions , @xmath9 though nonadditive , asymptotically becomes extensive with respect to the definition@xcite    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the degree of freedom , while @xmath12 under the same circunstance , may or may not be nonextensive .",
    "it also has been claimed@xcite that this occurs for systems in which the phase space is occupied in a scale - invariant way .",
    "we show that , though the criterion of scale - invariance is satisfied by the joint density probability of the matrix elements of the disordered ensembles , they only become extensive when the @xmath1 limit is taken . on the other hand , if restriction in the variation of the variables is introduced by forcing them to occupy only a fraction of the whole phase space then , situations occur which made the nonadditive entropy extensive for values of the entropic parameter different from one .",

    "the above distribution is normalized with respect to the measure @xmath18 as matrix elements in ( [ 12 ] ) are statistically independent random variables , one should expect that their distribution should be additive with respect to the bs entropy and nonadditive and nonextensive with respect to @xmath0 .",
