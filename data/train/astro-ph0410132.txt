    "2003 ) .    at z@xmath0 ,",
    "the most relevant signatures are expected in the near - ir @xmath8 m window .",
    "most feasibility studies during the last years have been motivated by jwst , which should be able to observe galaxies up to redshifts of the order of @xmath6 20 - 30 .",
    "however , the delay of jwst and the availability of well suited near - ir facilities in ground - based 8 - 10 m telescopes hasten the development of observational projects targeting @xmath9 sources .",
    "the first studies on the physical properties of these sources can be started nowadays with instruments such as isaac / vlt , and pursued with improved efficiency using the future multi - object spectrographs to come , such as emir at gtc ( @xmath10 2006 ) , or kmos for the second generation of vlt instruments ( @xmath10 2009 ) .",
    "in other words , the efficiency of this research is closely related to the instrumental developments in the near - ir domain .",
    "we present here the first results from our ongoing pilot project with isaac / vlt , aimed at the detection of @xmath11 sources through lensing clusters used as gravitational telescopes ( gts ) .",
    "our goal is to build up the first spectroscopic sample of galaxies at @xmath11 starting with gts , in preparation of future massive surveys in the field .",
    "such sample should allow to start a detailed study on the physical properties of these objects ( sfr , extinction , metallicity , imf , ... ) , and also start constraining their global properties ( number counts , luminosity function , clustering properties , ... ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we review in section  [ identification ] the techniques and main results recently obtained on the identification of high - z galaxies in the optical bands , both in the field and using lensing clusters . in sect .",
    "[ z7 - 10 ] we summarize the observational properties expected for galaxies at 7 @xmath12 z @xmath12 11 .",
    "our pilot survey with isaac / vlt , aimed at the detection of z@xmath0 sources , is presented in details in sect .",
    "[ vltsurvey ] .",
    "the first results issued from our photometric and spectroscopic survey are discussed in this section , in particular the preliminary confirmation rate , and the global properties of our high - z candidates , including the latest results on the possible @xmath13 candidate a1835 - 1916 . a discussion on the preliminary results and constraints derived from the 7@xmath14 z @xmath14 10 photometric candidates is given in sect .",

    "different field surveys in the optical bands have been successful in the systematic search for galaxies close to the reionisation epoch .",
    "these surveys are mainly based on 2 different techniques , which can easily be exploited in the near - ir bands : narrowband ( nb ) imaging surveys aimed at detecting ly@xmath20  emission , and broad - band multi - color surveys using photometric redshifts at some level ( see a review by spinrad , 2003 ) .    the pioneering large area lyman alpha survey ( lala , rhoads & malhotra 2001 , rhoads et al . 2003 ) used nb imaging together with @xmath21 broad - band photometry to target strong ly@xmath20  emission at @xmath22 in a kpno + ctio @xmath23 field of view .",
    "the spectroscopic follow up at lris / keck confirmed 3/4 candidates , with important line fluxes ( a few @xmath24 erg @xmath25 s@xmath18 ) and @xmath26 km / s .",
    "rhoads et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have recently published new results at higher redshifts : a z=6.535 galaxy , representing 1/3 of candidates confirmed , with restframe @xmath27 km / s and ly@xmath20  flux @xmath28 erg @xmath25 s@xmath18 .",
    "other nb surveys in the field have also provided interesting galaxy samples in the z@xmath29 interval : the z=6.17 galaxy found by cuby et al .",
    "( 2003 ) in the cfht - virmos deep survey ; the two @xmath30 galaxies detected by kodaira et al . ( 2003 ) , and the large sample of ly@xmath20  emitters at @xmath22 by hu et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . in the later case ,",
    "the authors used a combination of nb imaging at 8150  ( suprimecam ) and broad - band photometry in the optical bands to select candidates for a subsequent spectroscopic follow up with deimos / keck .",
    "their confirmation rate is very high : 18 sources out of 26 candidates are confirmed at high - z in a @xmath31 field of view , thus leading to 0.03 sources / arcmin@xmath32 and redshift bin @xmath33 .",
    "all these sources have important ly@xmath20  fluxes ( a few @xmath24 erg @xmath25 s@xmath18 ) , and display broad ly@xmath20  lines ( @xmath34 km / s ) .",
    "the broad - band photometric selection of high - z sources is usually an extrapolation of the drop - out lbgs technique to higher redshifts , with subsequent spectroscopic identification of the selected candidates .",
    "when the photometric spectral coverage is wide enough , standard photometric redshifts can be derived through sed fitting procedures .",
    "an excellent example of this technique is the sample at @xmath35 selected by lehnert & bremer ( 2003 ) in a 44 arcmin@xmath32 field , using an @xmath36 color criterium .",
    "6 out of 12 `` good '' candidates were spectroscopically confirmed with fors / vlt , thus leading to a number density for these sources which is close to lbgs at lower redshifts .",

    "gravitational magnification by lensing clusters has proven highly successful in identifying a large fraction of the most distant galaxies known today .",

    "another interesting object recently discovered by hu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) is a lensed galaxy at z=6.56 behind the cluster a370 .",
    "the authors used nb imaging at 9152  obtained with lris on the keck telescope , to identify the image by the equivalent width of the line emission and the absence of flux at lower wavelengths .",
    "as it happens with sources identified from nb imaging , the flux measured in the line is relatively high:@xmath39 erg @xmath25 s@xmath18 .",
    "the magnification factor is moderate , only 4.5 , the source beeing located more than 1 from the cluster center .",
    "a deep and `` blind '' spectroscopic survey for high-@xmath1 ly@xmath20  emitting sources was performed by santos et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , around the critical lines in 9 intermediate-@xmath1 lensing clusters .",
    "they targeted candidates at @xmath40 , magnified by a factor of at least 10 .",
    "eleven of such candidates were later confirmed at @xmath41 with lris long - slit and esi spectra at keck , taking advantage from the higher resolution to resolve the [ oii]@xmath423727 doublet or ly@xmath20  asymmetric profiles to discriminate between low and high-@xmath1 sources .",
    "thanks to the lensing magnification , these authors derived the ly@xmath20  luminosity function to unprecedented depths ( see also j. richard s poster , this conference ) .    in a recent paper , kneib et al .",
    "( 2004 ) discuss the identification of a possible @xmath43 compact galaxy behind a2218 .",
    "this is a faint triply imaged galaxy identified from deep @xmath1-band imaging with acs / hst .",
    "although there is no emission line detected in this object , both photometric and lensing modelling considerations provide a fair determination of its redshift .",
    "regardless of the precise redshift , the multi - wavelength data available for this object already provide an interesting information on its nature ( see also d. schaerer s talk and j. richard s poster , this conference ) .",
    "the important point here is that gts allow to define different samples of high-@xmath1 sources , using the same criteria as for field surveys ( nb or broad - band imaging ) , but also some specific criteria based on lens - modelling considerations ( systematic searches around the critical lines ) .",
    "all of them have a common point : the final samples will consist of sources intrinsically fainter than the field ones .",
    "the search efficiency as compared to blank fiends depends on two opposite trends : gravitational magnification ( allowing to increase the number of faint sources , and thus the total number of sources at the end ) , and dilution due to the reduction of the effective area surveyed .",
