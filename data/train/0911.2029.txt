    "the first - order ordinary differential system @xmath14with a @xmath15 matrix of continuous or piecewise continuous periodic coefficients @xmath0 is a classical problem arising in miscellaneous models of applied mathematics and mathematical physics .",
    "its analysis largely relies on the floquet theorem asserting that the matricant @xmath16 , which is the fundamental solution of ( [ 1 ] ) yielding @xmath17 , can be factored into the product@xmath18where @xmath19  ( @xmath20 with @xmath21),@xmath22 ( @xmath23 is the identity matrix ) , and @xmath24 is a constant matrix @xcite . by ( [ 2 ] ) ,",
    "@xmath24 is defined by the equation @xmath25where @xmath26 is termed the monodromy matrix ( its reference to @xmath27 is dropped hereafter ) .",
    "it can be calculated by a number of available methods , e.g. , using the peano series of multiple integrals of @xmath28 , or applying polynomial expansion of @xmath29 or discretizing @xmath28 . in many problems",
    "the system matrix @xmath28 is a continuous function of a certain control parameter @xmath30 and hence also @xmath31 at first glance , the matrix logarithm @xmath32 is well - behaved as long as the logarithm of the eigenvalues @xmath33 of @xmath2 is well - behaved .",
    "however , it turns out that @xmath34 diverges at @xmath35 where @xmath9 corresponds to a non - semisimple ( not diagonalizable ) @xmath36 with a degenerate eigenvalue @xmath37 whose values , being taken on the same riemann sheet of @xmath38 are situated on the opposite edges of the cut .",
    "this fairly surprising observation seems to have passed unnoticed in the extensive reference literature on the matrix logarithm .",
    "the manner in which such a divergence reveals itself in the floquet formalism is discussed in the present paper in the context where eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) is associated with time - harmonic elastic waves travelling at frequency @xmath1 in unidirectionally ( 1d ) periodic media . within this context ,",
    "the system ( [ 1 ] ) such that consists of @xmath39 equations and hence is equivalent to hill s equation describes scalar acoustic ( or electromagnetic ) waves @xcite ; the cases where ( [ 1 ] ) consists of @xmath40 equations corresponds to coupled waves in elastic isotropic or anisotropic media , in piezoelectric or piezomagnetoelectric media , etc . in either of these cases , the monodromy matrix @xmath41",
    "is often called the propagator ( of the wave field ) over the period @xmath42    the matrix logarithm @xmath43 ( [ 3 ] ) is a crucial ingredient in the dynamic - homogenization approach .",
    "assuming that @xmath44 in the 1d floquet theorem ( [ 2 ] ) is a relatively slowly varying function , this approach seeks to replace an exact solution @xmath16 by its slow component @xmath45 and hence to replace the actual periodically inhomogeneous material by an homogenized medium with spatially constant but frequency dispersive properties described by the effective matrix @xmath46see e.g. @xcite .",
    "obviously , the matrix @xmath47 also provides ( regardless of any assumptions ) an exact solution @xmath48 at the interfaces between the periods .",
    "another aspect of the matrix logarithm @xmath49 is related to the floquet dispersion branches @xmath50 or @xmath51 .",
    "these are determined by the secular equation for @xmath41 , @xmath52 = 0 ,   \\label{6}\\]]so that the definition @xmath53 yields @xmath54 or else by the formally equivalent secular equation for @xmath55 @xmath56 = 0 .",

    "the frequency intervals where @xmath60 is real or complex are called passbands and stopbands , respectively .",
    "the paper is concerned with the typical case where @xmath61 is unimodular ( @xmath5 ) and so the bz edges contain the passband / stopband crossovers at a set of frequencies @xmath62 associated with a degenerate pair of eigenvalues @xmath37",
    "of@xmath63 according to the background outlined in  2 , this is the case for a normal propagation across an arbitrary anisotropic periodic structure or for an arbitrary propagation direction in the presence of appropriately oriented symmetry plane .",
    "the original material of this work consists of two parts ,   3 and  4 .",
    "the first part (  3 ) deals with the problem in general .",
    "it is shown that the matrix @xmath64 and hence @xmath65 must have components diverging as @xmath7 when @xmath66 i.e. when the real floquet branches tend to the bz edges or the complex part of @xmath67 tends to zero .",

    "( [ 5 ] ) may become numerically unstable at @xmath1 close to @xmath68 a transition is explained from a weakly inhomogeneous to perfectly homogeneous elastic medium , for which @xmath69 certainly does not diverge .",
    "the second part (  4 ) presents detailed analytical examples of @xmath12 and of its diverging asymptotics for @xmath70 for the shear - horizontal wave in a periodic structure composed of piecewise homogeneous bilayers or layers in spring - mass - spring contact .",
    "particular attention is given to the high - contrast case with either a soft layer in the bilayer or with a soft spring in the interfacial joint .",
    "the interest to this case lies in the fact that the first stopband at the bz edges and hence the local divergence of @xmath11 occurs at low frequency that may in principle be made arbitrarily small . to this end",
    ", a link to the regular asymptotics of the same @xmath71 near the point @xmath13 is also elucidated .",

    "the periodic matrix of coefficients @xmath28 defined through @xmath78 @xmath79 and @xmath1 , @xmath80 is pure imaginary and has the hamiltonian structure@xmath81where the superscript @xmath82 means transpose and @xmath83 is the matrix with zero diagonal and identity off - diagonal 3@xmath843 blocks ( see e.g. @xcite for the details ) .    in the following",
    "we deal with the essentially typical case of a medium with at least a single symmetry plane @xmath85 orthogonal to the axis @xmath76 or @xmath86 then the trace of @xmath28 is zero for any @xmath87 .",

    "note that no stipulation of any material symmetry is needed if the wave propagates strictly along the periodicity direction @xmath72 ( i.e. if @xmath96 ) , which is when ( [ 9 ] ) is always true .",
    "also note that the out - of - plane motion with respect to the symmetry plane @xmath97 of a monoclinic body ( which has no other symmetry planes ) can be cast in the form with property ( [ 9 ] ) , see @xcite .",
    "let @xmath1 be a single free dispersion parameter ( @xmath77 is fixed or expressed through @xmath1 ) .",
    "each pair @xmath98 corresponds to a set of dispersion curves @xmath99 in the bz @xmath100 , $ ] which are symmetric about the line @xmath101 in view of ( [ 9 ] ) , the eigenvalues @xmath102 and @xmath103 occurring , respectively , at the centre and edges of the bz , are assuredly degenerate .",
    "we are interested in the case @xmath103 which is associated with a sequence of passband / stopband crossover points at the bz edges , and specifically in the behaviour of the matrix @xmath104 in the vicinity of these points .",
    "denote by @xmath106 the frequency , at which some pair of eigenvalue branches @xmath107 of the monodromy matrix @xmath2 fall into two - fold degeneracy @xmath108 rendering @xmath109 non - semisimple . consider a function @xmath110 defined on the zeroth riemann sheet with a cut @xmath59 passing through @xmath111 let @xmath1 lying in the stopband or passband tend to @xmath9 from , respectively , above or below . then @xmath112 and @xmath113 tend to @xmath114 thus approaching their degenerate value @xmath115 from the opposite sides of the cut for @xmath116 , and , correspondingly , @xmath117 tend to @xmath118 meaning that two floquet branches tend to the opposite edges of the bz .",
    "this is indeed nothing else than a very standard setup .",

    "a few formal remarks are in order .",
    "first it is reiterated that even though the components of the dealt - with matrix @xmath161 diverge as @xmath162 its eigenvalues @xmath163 remain formally well - defined so long as @xmath164 it is also understood that the exponential of this @xmath165 at any @xmath166 certainly reproduces ( continuous ) @xmath126 . regarding the infinity of @xmath167 precisely at @xmath168 which is when @xmath169 on the right - hand side of ( [ 13 ] ) , it simply tells us that the conventional definition of @xmath146 which refers both eigenvalues @xmath121 to the zeroth riemann sheet of @xmath116 with the cut @xmath59 fixing the edges of the bz @xmath170 , $ ] precludes this matrix function of @xmath1 from reaching the limiting point @xmath9 of the path @xmath10 continuously .",
    "it is clear from the above that shifting the cut in the @xmath171-plane away from the point @xmath172 while keeping @xmath173 on the same riemann sheet leads to a different matrix logarithm @xmath6  that has degenerate eigenvalues @xmath174  and hence is well - behaved at @xmath175  and around it .",
    "however , this gain for @xmath1 near @xmath176 is at the expense of one or another essential deficiency elsewhere for the redefined @xmath177  for instance , if the eigenvalues @xmath173 of @xmath34 are taken on the zeroth riemann sheet with the cut @xmath178 then this @xmath6 has the same divergence @xmath179 due to the degeneracy @xmath180 at the set @xmath181 of passband / stopband crossovers occurring at @xmath182 an exception is the origin point @xmath183 where @xmath184 and so any @xmath123 is continuous ; however , the low - frequency onset of @xmath123 defined by taking the cut @xmath185 has no physical sense ( see appendix ,  a2 ) .",
    "another possibility is to use a cut @xmath186 at @xmath187 e.g. , at @xmath188 such that @xmath189 then @xmath190 whose eigenvalues @xmath191 lie on the zeroth riemann sheet , is well - behaved with @xmath192 growing from zero but only until reaching @xmath193 where there is a jump to a different matrix @xmath194 for which the eigenvalue @xmath195 has to be shifted from @xmath196 to @xmath197 with @xmath198 increasing above @xmath188 . note that a similar piecewise discontinuity pertains in the bz @xmath199 $ ] to the logarithm of @xmath41 that is not unimodular ( @xmath200)@xmath201 thus , using any unconventional definition of the logarithm of @xmath41 based on shifting the cut from the point @xmath172 is hardly an alternative .",
    "it remains to settle a natural question concerning the case of a homogeneous elastic material , for which the matrix @xmath202 is constant , hence @xmath203 and so @xmath123 merely returns the initial @xmath204 which is certainly continuous in @xmath205 technically , the difference with the case of a periodic medium is that a constant @xmath202 keeps @xmath109 diagonalizable ( semisimple ) at the degeneracy point @xmath206 under discussion this degeneracy of @xmath207 implies nothing more than an odd number of half - wavelengths within the interval @xmath208 - note no relevance to degenerate eigenvalues @xmath209 of @xmath202 that do render @xmath202 and hence @xmath210 non - semisimple . ] .",
