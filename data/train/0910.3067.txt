    "the relative protein density fluctuations decrease with the size of a membrane patch which is considered . if we assume a random distribution of inclusions , for a patch with @xmath164 inclusions the relative fluctuations of the inclusion number are of the order of @xmath165 .",
    "thus for small patches , the inhomogeneities are strongest and budding will preferably occur on the smallest possible lengthscale .",
    "a small average membrane curvature with appropriate sign further attracts proteins to those regions where the bending energy per inclusion is already reduced .",
    "however , this clustering of inclusions during the budding process is hindered by a ring with opposite membrane curvature that forms the neck of a growing bud .",
    "this ring acts as energetic barrier that prevents further inclusions to enter a patch of the membrane where budding has already started @xcite .",
    "because of the neck formation and the diffusion - limited budding process , the bud size is roughly determined by the initial inclusion density on the membrane .",

    "@xcite . however , the very good match is somewhat fortuituous because we replace the thermal wavelength in the ideal gas free energy by the inclusion size , such that it is similar to the free energy obtained on a triangulated vesicle with a bond length that approximately equals to the inclusion diameter , compare @xcite .",
    "we consider curvature radii of the inclusions that are both smaller and larger than the curvature radius of the vesicle . for @xmath175 and @xmath176 ,",
    "such that @xmath171 , bending energy is needed to insert the flat inclusion into the curved vesicle .",
    "this bending energy cost decreases with increased opening angle @xmath28 and is zero for @xmath177 where the curvature radius of the inclusion equals the curvature radius of the vesicle .",
    "if @xmath28 is further increased , the bending energy per inclusion continues to decrease as more and more of the vesicle area consists of catenoidal patches around the inclusions . for @xmath178 , i.  e.  for even larger opening angles than plotted in the figure ,",
    "the inclusions have optimal density and the bending energy gained by grafting all @xmath170 inclusions to the vesicle is @xmath179 .",
    "in addition to the bending energy , there is an energy cost @xmath180 for grafting that arises due to the saddle - splay modulus , which has been chosen to be @xmath181 for consistency with ref .",
    "the energy cost per inclusion only depends on the geodesic curvature of the membrane at the inclusion , i.  e.  on the opening angle @xmath28 , which implies @xmath182 .",

    "already for @xmath201 and @xmath202 inclusions , the energy per inclusion on the bud and in the plane are approximately equal .",
    "larger energy gains are possible for larger bud radii , for which many more than the simulated 36 inclusions and a larger area of the bilayer patch are needed . from these considerations ,",

    "although the interaction between the inclusions by membrane deformation is repulsive , the screening of the repulsive interaction due to the average membrane curvature allows higher inclusion densities on a bud than in the initial vesicle .",
    "translational entropy of the inclusions favors the formation of equally - sized daughter vesicles and lifts the degeneracy that is found for states with vanishing bending energy",

    "the catenoids are closely packed and the bending energy for the entire vesicle vanishes . for high inclusion density , the boundary conditions for",
    "the membrane deformation around the inclusion do not allow the formation of catenoidal patches , and the inclusions always feel the membrane - mediated repulsive interaction with neighboring inclusions .",
    "in this regime , bud formation can occur .",
    "if we assume a specific biological mechanism that leads to formation of clusters with well - defined and limited size , we find that such a mechanism can induce bud formation and vesiculation without the need to insert additional conical proteins into the cell membrane : cluster formation reduces the preferred curvature radius of the membrane .",
    "we quantify the effect of aggregation by the coagulation factor , which describes how the preferred curvature radius for a fixed amount of inclusions changes with the cluster size .    in general , our analytical model is applicable for a wide range of length scales and inclusion geometries .",

    ".    it would be interesting to test the validity of our model in the limits of ( a ) very small inclusions , such as lipids with large headgroups , when the description of the lipid membrane by curvature elastic constants may not be appropriate and ( b ) very floppy membranes , when neglecting the thermal membrane undulations may not be justified ."
