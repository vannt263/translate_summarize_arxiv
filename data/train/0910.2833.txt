    "one of the interesting phenomena observed in this object was the discovery of the so - called `` reentrant metal - to - insulator transition '' in a magnetic field at filling factor @xmath7=3/2  @xcite .",
    "in ref.@xcite that anomaly was attributed to the presence of long - range potential fluctuations with amplitude comparable with the fermi energy in this material . however , the author of  @xcite explained those magnetoresistance anomalies by crossing of landau levels with different spin directions 0@xmath9 and 1@xmath10 when the magnetic field increases . in the present work",
    "the studies of magnetoresistance and hall effect were conducted in tilted magnetic fields to determine the dependence of @xmath20-factor on the tilt angle and the possible causes of the anomalies in magnetoresistance and conductivity at filling factor @xmath7=2 in the sample @xmath2-si / sige with @xmath2=2@xmath310@xmath6@xmath5 .",

    "the temperature dependence of @xmath0 demonstrates the metallic characteristics ( @xmath250 ) .",
    "however , at @xmath21 = 7.2 t the derivative @xmath26 reverses the sign .",
    "moreover , the resistance depends on the current orientation with respect to the in - plane magnetic field . at @xmath27 13 t",
    "there is a transition from the dependence @xmath28 to the dependence @xmath29 .",

    "these data allowed to calculate the dependence of @xmath35 on the magnetic field at different angles @xmath12 between the 2d interface surface normal and the magnetic field orientation ( @xmath12=0@xmath36 if @xmath37 is perpendicular to the 2d interface ) . in fig.[fig:2 ] , @xmath0 and @xmath8 traces are plotted versus normal component @xmath38 for a number of the tilt angles .      as can be seen from the fig.[fig:2 ] the maximum of @xmath0 at @xmath7=3/2 increases with the increase of the tilt angle , which was interpreted by many researchers as a m - i reentrant phase transition .",
    "however , the dependence of @xmath8 on the angle at @xmath7=3/2 does not show any anomaly .",
