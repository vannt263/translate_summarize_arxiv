    "<S> @xcite pointed out that the hllz protocol @xcite is vulnerable to a special participant attack strategy ( hereafter called the qgwz attack ) where alice s secret message can be extracted by any dishonest agent without any help of the other agents . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this paper , we comment that some errors may exist in the qgwz attack and thus it fails to attack hllz protocol successfully . </S>",
    "<S> the six main stages of the hllz protocol are _ preparation phase _ , _ encryption phase _ , _ the first detection _ , _ encoding phase _ , _ recovery phase _ and _ the second detection_@xcite . in short , </S>",
    "<S> based on the linear property of the quantum random phase shift operations ( rpsos ) or equivalently random single - qubit rotations along the @xmath0-axis , the encryption , encoding and recovering phase of this protocol can be expressed as the addition / subtraction of the rotation angles on each photon ( qubit ) at different stages : @xmath1 here @xmath2 represents a rotation on photon @xmath3 with @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the rotation angle made by alice on the photon @xmath3 according to the bit value @xmath6 or @xmath7 of her secret message @xmath8 . the measurement action in the recovery phase by the agent ( say zach ) , to which alice sent the photons with encoded message , reflects basically whether there is a rotation of an angle @xmath9 on the photon ( qubit ) @xmath3 or not . </S>",
    "<S> if there is , the bit value of the message bit @xmath3 is @xmath10 ; otherwise , @xmath6 .    grasping the main steps of the hllz protocol , the scenario for an dishonest agent ( say charlie ) in the qgwz attack is to entangle the transmitted photons with prepared ancilla photons firstly , to escape from the detection secondly , and to attain the secret message without being discovered lastly @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the errors that existed in the ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite will doom charlie to fail to extract the secret message even if he can escape from the detection . </S>",
    "<S> the first typo in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is in the last sentence of the first paragraph of step ( e2 ) in the second column on page 5473 . the correct sentence for that should read as `` then charlie sends the fake sequence @xmath11 to alice . '' . in other words , the sequence that was sent out by charlie is @xmath11 rather than @xmath12 stated in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but this typo is very minor as it is obvious from the subsequent description in ref </S>",
    "<S> .  @xcite that it is the @xmath11 sequence that was sent out .    </S>",
    "<S> the possible serious error is in the expression of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 9 ) of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite which was derived from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 7 ) of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite by a controlled - controlled-(@xmath13 ) operation ( referred to as @xmath14 operation in @xcite ) with photons @xmath15 and @xmath16 being the control qubits and photon @xmath17 being the target qubit . </S>",
    "<S> the action of @xmath14 operation on computational basis states is given by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent the control qubits and @xmath21 stands for the target qubit on which the @xmath13 operation acts . </S>",
    "<S> so the correct expression for eq .  ( 9 ) of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite should read as @xmath22 comparing eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ qgwz-0-y ] ) above with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 10 ) of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , one can find that the two @xmath23 photon states in those two equations are identical rather than orthogonal . </S>",
    "<S> the statement that the two states of photons @xmath23 are orthogonal in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite comes from comparing the incorrect eq .  </S>",

    "<S> @xcite with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 10 ) of ref .  </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , and thus can not extract alice s secret bit value in practice . as a result , the qgwz attack fails to extract alice s secret message bits from the hllz protocol .    </S>",
    "<S> the main idea of the qgwz attack seems ( i ) to use an entanglement operation to entangle each of the photon in sequence @xmath26 with prepared ancilla photons to escape the first detection of the hllz protocol , ( ii ) to use the inverse entanglement operation to separate the entangled states back to separable state to obtain the secret message and to escape the second detection of the hllz protocol . </S>",
    "<S> the particular entanglement operation in the ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is @xmath14 and we have shown that it fails to extract the secret message . </S>",
    "<S> one may wonder whether charlie can extract the secret with other operations instead of @xmath14 in this qgwz - like attack . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we show below that charlie will still fail to extract the secret even if he can apply other entanglement operations in the qgwz - like attacks . without loss of generality , </S>",
    "<S> suppose the photon @xmath3 in the @xmath26 sequence sent out by the last agent , zach , is in the state @xmath27 where @xmath4 . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , charlie may prepare his ancilla qubits sequence @xmath28 each in the state @xmath29 , and apply a particular kind of entanglement operation @xmath30 on @xmath31 such that @xmath32_{s_j } , \\label{e_operation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the rotation operation along the @xmath0 axis defined in ( [ superposition ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> after these operations , charlie sends sequence @xmath26 to alice , and he may escape from alice s first detection by telling the value of his rotation angle of either @xmath36 or @xmath37 . that is , when alice selects the photon @xmath3 to check the security of the quantum channel used , charlie can first measure the corresponding ancilla qubit @xmath38 in the @xmath39 basis . </S>",
    "<S> he then announces his rotation angle of either @xmath36 or @xmath37 when the measured result is in @xmath40 or in @xmath41 , respectively . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , alice will not discover charlie s dishonest action during her first detection step . from this point of view , the qgwz attack of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is just a simplified special case of above description where charlie s @xmath30 is the controlled - controlled-(@xmath13 ) operation and the rotated phase shift angle @xmath42 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e_operation ] ) is @xmath43 . in short , charlie </S>",
    "<S> hence can escape from the first detection in the hllz protocol with this qgwz - like attack .    </S>",
    "<S> after that , in the hllz protocol , alice will encode her secret message bit value on each of the remaining photons in sequence @xmath26 with a rotation operation along the @xmath0-axis by an angle of @xmath9 if the bit value is @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , no operation is performed if the bit value is @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> this message - encoding operation can be expressed as @xmath45 when it is applied to the state of eq .  </S>",

    "<S> ( [ e_operation ] ) .    after intercepting the transmitted photon again </S>",
    "<S> , charlie will apply the inverse entanglement operation @xmath51 to separate the entanglement between photon @xmath38 and @xmath17 in the qgwz - like attack . </S>",
    "<S> he then will try to figure out alice s secret message by making an measurement on his ancilla qubits in the orthonormal basis of @xmath39 . since @xmath52 , if charlie applies the operator @xmath51 to eq .  </S>",

    "<S> ( [ 0_es ] ) and eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 1_es ] ) , it is obvious that charlie can not distinguish whether the state of photon @xmath17 has been rotated by an angle of @xmath9 or not from the measurement result of the ancilla photons @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> thus charlie can not extract the transmitted secret bits even if he can apply the entanglement operations defined in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> the qgwz attack as well as the qgwz - like attacks which apply entangled operations other than the @xmath14 operation fail to obtain the transmitted secret message bits of the hllz protocol . </S>"
