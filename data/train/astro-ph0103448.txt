    "circular polarization ( cp ) observations of radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) provide a unique opportunity , especially in conjunction with linear polarization observations , for constraining the magnetic field geometry , particle energy distribution , and even particle composition ( @xmath3 vs. @xmath4 ) of their jets .",
    "a number of possible mechanisms have been proposed for the production of circular polarization in agn ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the two most likely are the _ intrinsic _ circular polarization of synchrotron radiation and faraday _ conversion _ of linear to circular polarization , a propagation effect , e.g. @xcite .",
    "@xcite catalog a large number of circular polarization observations of agn , mainly from the 1970s , and find typical levels of @xmath5% . after the survey by @xcite",
    ", there have been no major cp observations published until recently .    in @xcite , we reported the detection of circular polarization in the parsec - scale jet of 3c279 .",
    "detailed analysis suggested the jet is predominately a pair plasma .",
    "circular polarization has since been detected in the galactic center @xcite , the galactic x - ray binary ss433 @xcite , the intra - day variable source pks 1519 - 273 @xcite , and a sample of more than twenty agn by @xcite , hereafter rn&s . in @xcite ,",
    "hereafter h&w , we presented multi - epoch , parsec - scale cp detections of four agn , made with the very long baseline array ( vlba ) at 15 ghz .    here",
    "we present results from the first large scale circular polarization survey made at very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) resolution . in december 1996",
    ", we observed a sample of 40 agn at 5 ghz ( @xmath6 6 cm ) with the vlba .",
    "these observations were originally made as part of a continuing study of the parsec - scale linear polarization properties of blazars ( @xcite ; attridge et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "they do not comprise a complete sample .",
    "we report the results of a re - analysis of these data for circular polarization .",
    "the observations were scheduled in a continuous 48 hour block , with source changes after every 5.5 minute scan .",
    "sources were highly interleaved in the schedule to maximize ( u , v)-coverage .",
    "each source was observed for at least ten scans , five on each day , giving a total integration time of nearly an hour .",
    "the data were recorded at each station using 1-bit sampling and were correlated at the vlba correlator in socorro , nm .",
    "the correlated data contained all four cross - correlations ( rr , rl , lr , ll ) , each with four intermediate frequencies ( ifs ) . the data were loaded into nrao s astronomical imaging processing system ( aips ) @xcite and calibrated using standard techniques for vlbi polarization observations , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the vlba station in hancock , nh was found to have a low flux calibration and significantly higher noise than the other antennas and was dropped from the observations . for a specific description of the original calibration steps",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the reader is referred to h&w for a detailed discussion of how to detect small levels of circular polarization with the vlba . there",
    "we describe three techniques for robustly detecting circular polarization with circularly polarized antenna feeds . in our re - analysis of the 5 ghz survey for circular polarization",
    ", we applied the _ gain transfer _ technique which provides a direct measure of the circular polarization in a source .",
    "we were unable to apply the other techniques described in h&w due to both a lack of strong circular polarization signals in the sample ( most are a few mjy or less ) and the lack of sufficiently bright extended structure .",
    "the application of the gain transfer technique is straight forward , requiring that we simply make no assumption about the circular polarization of a source during self - calibration , i.e. we only assume @xmath7 .",
    "this will leave uncalibrated the @xmath8 complex gain ratio at each antenna .",
    "for the source model , we used the best model obtained from the original analysis , and self - calibrated the data in amplitude and phase .",
    "after self - calibration , we removed the effects of antenna feed leakage determined by applying the aips task pcal to the unpolarized source oq208 .",
    "this step is crucial as uncorrected feed leakage terms may induce non - closing errors in the parallel hand data .",
    "after feed leakage correction , we self - calibrated the data again in amplitude and phase using the same model as before .",
    "the data were then carefully edited to remove clearly discrepant polarization data from stokes q , u , and v in an antenna based manner .",
    "these `` final '' data , could then be used to either ( 1 ) solve for the @xmath8 complex gain ratios by self - calibration assuming no circular polarization in that source ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) , or ( 2 ) look for circular polarization on a source by applying a smoothed set of @xmath8 complex gains from a sub - set of sources .",
    "the key to gain transfer calibration is determining a smoothed set of @xmath8 complex antenna gains . as suggested in h&w , we initially used nearly the entire 40 source sample to produce a smoothed set of gains .",
    "the large sample size was a great asset , and by smoothing the gains over several hours and averaging over many sources , we were insensitive to the particular characteristics ( such as strong circular polarization ) of any one source .",
    "we then applied this smoothed set of gains back to the sources , imaged in circular polarization , and removed the most strongly polarized sources from contributing to the smoothed gains .",
    "we repeated this process through a few iterations until there were no sources with apparent cp @xmath11% that contributed to the smoothed gains .",
    "mjy ) which would not produce at least @xmath12 mjy of cp at @xmath13% .",
    "] this cutoff gave thirteen sources contributing to the smoothed gains with a boxcar averaging window of six hours .",
    "our main results are insensitive to both the details of which sources contribute to the gains , and our choice of smoothing function and time - scale .",
    "the reader is referred to h&w for a detailed discussion of the uncertainties associated with circular polarization observations with circularly polarized feeds . here",
    "we would like to briefly remind the reader of two points .",
    "( 1 ) while it is important to remove feed leakage terms from the parallel hand data , contributions from the small uncertainties in the determination of the feed leakage terms are insignificant relative to the gain uncertainties .",
    "( 2 ) beam squint , resulting from pointing errors , shows up as a pure amplitude gain effect and is therefore naturally included in our estimate of gain uncertainties . in the appendix",
    "we have refined our estimate of the gain calibration uncertainties as presented in h&w .    as a final check on our results",
    ", we divided the single 48-hour data set into two sub - sets and imaged each separately in cp .",
    "this provided a direct test of our understanding of the uncertainties from all but the longest time - scale effects ( @xmath14h ) .",
    "we found no significant differences between the two parts of the 48-hour observation .",
    "table [ t : results ] lists our results , and figure [ f:0607 ] presents an image of the circular polarization distribution of a typical source ( pks 0607 - 157 ) . the sources in this sample tend to be strongly core dominated , and the cp we observe is coincident with the bright vlbi cores .",
    "any small displacements from the vlbi cores do not appear significant within our positional uncertainties which are approximately a beam - width divided by the snr of the cp measurement .",
    "for this reason , we simply report the measured cp as a fraction of the peak total intensity .",
    "the uncertainties and limits listed in table [ t : results ] are dominated by gain calibration uncertainties which are estimated in the appendix .",
    "the total quoted uncertainty , @xmath15 , includes both the gain uncertainty and the rms noise in the stokes v map , added in quadrature .",
    "the limits in table [ t : results ] are the largest of @xmath12  mjy , @xmath16 , or @xmath17 .",
    "figure [ f : detect ] compares our detection rates for circular polarization for bl lacs and quasars with the sample of rn&s ( also at 5 ghz ) . for this comparison",
    "we have divided by the total vlbi flux ( rather than the peak vlbi flux ) to better compare to the australian telescope compact array ( atca ) integrated measurements .",
    "our detection rates are very similar to those of rn&s .",
    "we can do a similar comparison to the 15 ghz vlbi sample of h&w .",
    "here we compare the peak values for fractional circular polarization , @xmath18 , in our 5 ghz measurements to @xmath18 of the integrated core at 15 ghz , including model components out to 1.5 mas .",
    "this comparison essentially eliminates resolution based differences between the samples . while we find only 2/36 quasars or bl lacs with @xmath19% in the 5 ghz measurements presented here , the 15 ghz sample of h&w has a significantly higher detection rate for strong cp .",
    "there are five closely spaced ( @xmath20 2 month intervals ) epochs in h&w which include the same 11 quasars and bl lacs , three of which show repeated detections of cp .",
    "averaging over the epochs in h&w , we have a mean of 2.4/9.6 detections of @xmath19% from the quasars and bl lacs strong enough in total intensity in those epochs to have detectable cp at this level .",
    "although the total number of sources in h&w is small , this detection rate is nearly five times that seen here at 5 ghz , and we note that most of the detections in h&w are @xmath21% cp , and we observe no source with cp that strong in this 5 ghz sample .    the higher incidence of strong circular polarization detections in h&w may be due to one of three possible causes : ( 1 ) random fluctuations in small samples , ( 2 ) a broad frequency dependent effect , or ( 3 ) source selection criteria .",
    "we can evaluate option ( 1 ) by assuming simple binomial statistics based on our 5 ghz observations ( i.e. assume the chance of observing @xmath19% is @xmath22 ) .",
    "we find we would need approximately a 2.5 sigma random variation to explain the 15 ghz results of h&w .",
    "any broad frequency dependent effects , option ( 2 ) , depend on the generation mechanism of the circular polarization .",
    "while both intrinsic cp and faraday conversion have specific , frequency dependent signatures , the inhomogeneous , self - similar nature of vlbi radio cores complicates the analysis considerably ( e.g. @xcite ) and may lead to a flat @xmath18 spectrum for both mechanisms @xcite .    with",
    "no clear frequency dependent effect , we suspect that source selection criteria , option ( 3 ) above , may explain the higher levels of circular polarization observed in h&w .",
    "the sample of h&w was part of multi - epoch monitoring program of the strongest , most currently active blazars ( @xcite ; ojha et al . in prep . ) , and the three quasars with high levels of cp were undergoing violent core outbursts during the observations .",
    "this is consistent with the report by rn&s of a significant correlation between overall source variability and fractional cp . for rn&s , who have only integrated observations , the correlation with source variability",
    "may be confused by a correlation with overall source `` compactness '' , as extended structure will decrease both the fractional cp of a source and its fractional variability . for the vlbi observations of h&w compactness",
    "is not an issue , and the higher levels of fractional cp appear correlated with the selection criteria of currently active sources for that sample .",
    "it is unclear how current core outburst events may lead to increased fractional circular polarization via the intrinsic mechanism .",
    "outbursts are typically associated with shocks that tend to order the magnetic field and increase particle densities . increased particle densities should not enhance the _",
    "fractional _ contribution of intrinsic circular polarization , and it is difficult to imagine how the _ uni - directional _ field necessary for intrinsic cp should be preferentially enhanced by a shock .",
    "if the uni - directional field is along the jet axis and the shocks are transverse , just the opposite should happen , and the relative contribution from intrinsic circular polarization should decrease . for faraday conversion ,",
    "ordered magnetic fields are necessary for both the generation of linear polarization and its conversion to circular polarization .",
    "shocks in the core may very well increase the contribution of faraday conversion to the circular polarization produced .",
    "rn&s found no significant difference between the distribution of circular polarization in the quasars and bl lacs in their sample , although they did find that bl lacs and quasars had significantly higher levels of cp than radio galaxies .",
    "their detailed analysis was made possible by the great precision ( @xmath23% ) with which atca can measure integrated cp .",
    "due to our higher uncertainty ( @xmath24% ) , which induces a dependence on source strength , we can not do a similar detailed analysis .",
    "the bl lacs in our sample tend to be weaker than the quasars and many have upper limits higher than the typical detection level for quasars .",
    "figure [ f : mc_ml ] is a plot of fractional core circular polarization , @xmath25 , versus fractional core linear polarization , @xmath26 .",
    "beyond the fact that linear polarization is almost always stronger than circular polarization , there does not appear to be any correlation between linear and circular polarization of the core .",
    "this was also noted by rn&s .",
    "one might expect that fractional linear polarization , a measure of field order , should correlate with fractional cp , as disordered magnetic fields will not generate significant _ net _ cp by either the intrinsic or conversion mechanism .",
    "the issue is complicated , however , by the possibility of faraday depolarization in the cores of these objects .",
    "large rotation measures have been observed in the cores of quasars by @xcite , and if the faraday effect is occurring in an external screen , the cp will remain largely unmodified ( cgs ) , e.g. @xcite ] , although the linear polarization may be significantly reduced .",
    "the scintillation mechanism described by @xcite for the production of cp has no correlation with linear polarization , but is expected to have rapid changes ( @xmath20 minutes  hours ) in sign which are not observed in agn ( see  [ s : consist ] ) .",
    "we find no correlation for fractional cp with either total intensity or redshift in this sample .",
    "we have a single source in common with the observations of rn&s : pks 0454 - 234 .",
    "they found @xmath27% integrated circular polarization in 1997.17 at 5 ghz , compared to our @xmath28 result of @xmath29% core circular polarization measured 11 weeks earlier ( also at 5 ghz ) .",
    "for the source pks 0607 - 157 we detect circular polarization of approximately @xmath30% in january of 1998 at 8 ghz ( homan et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    ", a signal which is stronger , but of the same sign as we report here at 5 ghz in observations made a full year earlier .",
    "this kind of short - term sign consistency in cp observations , as well as the possibility for longer - term consistency , is discussed in  [ s : consist ] .    in 3c279",
    "we observe strong circular polarization for five epochs in 1996 at 15 ghz ( h&w ) ; however , in the 5 ghz sample presented here , we do not detect significant cp for 3c279 in december of 1996  a little more than two months after the final 15 ghz cp observations by h&w .",
    "in @xcite we argue that the cp in 3c279 is associated with the core - west ( cw ) component which appears to be part of a core outburst event in 3c279 during 1996 .",
    "this component would have been strongly self - absorbed at 5 ghz in late 1996 , so we should not expect to see any cp from it .",
    "@xcite noted that circularly polarized sources tended to have a _ preferred handedness _ or _",
    "sign _ which they maintained over the course of a few years at 5 ghz . in h&w",
    ", we observed the same effect at 15 ghz over five epochs , taken at two month intervals during 1996 .",
    "here we present evidence that this sign consistency may persist for decades . between our sample and those of rn&s and h&w , there are six sources with circular polarization detected both recently and @xmath1 years ago @xcite : 3c84 , pks 0537 - 441 , 3c273 , 3c279 , pks 1921 - 293 , and pks 1934 - 638 .",
    "of those six sources , five have the same sign of circular polarization today as they preferred two decades ago measurements , cta 102 and 3c454.3 , were also detected @xmath1 years ago with the same sign @xcite . ] .",
    "though the statistics are small , this result is potentially very interesting .",
    "it suggests a long - lived property of the jets , stable on the time - scale of multiple outbursts , which sets the preferred sign of circular polarization @xcite . a natural possibility for this property is the polarity of a net magnetic flux in the jet , reflecting the magnetic flux at the central engine",
    "this is a fundamental parameter in electro - magnetic models of jet production ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a net flux can generate either intrinsic circular polarization or may drive the faraday conversion process with a small amount of faraday rotation , e.g. @xcite .",
    "another possible long - term property is the handedness of a helical field which may produce significant quantities of faraday conversion , e.g. @xcite .",
    "we have presented circular polarization results from a survey of the parsec - scale polarization polarization of 40 agn at 5 ghz .",
    "we found 11 circular polarization detections at the @xmath0 level or higher .",
    "this nearly quadruples the number of sources detected in cp at vlbi resolutions .",
    "we observed only two sources with high levels of cp , @xmath31% , and we believe that current outbursts in the sources observed by h&w could be related to the higher levels of cp detected there .",
    "we found no correlation between fractional linear and circular polarization across our sample .",
    "this may be due to faraday depolarization in the cores of agn which will leave circular polarization unaffected . in comparing these and other recent results to cp observations made @xmath1 years ago , we found that , in five of six cases , sources have the same sign of cp today as they did @xmath2 years ago .",
    "this suggests the presence of a long term property of the jets , such as the polarity of a net magnetic flux , that is stable on the time - scale of multiple outbursts .",

    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
    "this research has also made use of nasa s astrophysics data system abstract service .",
    "the calibration of circular antenna feeds for circular polarization is described in detail in h&w .",
    "the _ gain transfer _ procedure allows calibration of the @xmath8 complex antenna gain ratio .",
    "] at each antenna by self - calibration assuming zero circular polarization ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) on a subset of sources , smoothing the derived antenna gains , and applying the smoothed gains to all sources .",
    "figure [ f : brgains ] shows these gains for a typical antenna in our observations .    in h&w",
    ", we showed that there were two main contributions to the complex antenna gain ratios : ( 1 ) a long - term offset and ( 2 ) a short - term rapid variation .",
    "both contributions were of the order of a percent , and while the long - term offset could be easily corrected , the short - term rapid variation went essentially uncorrected .",
    "we noted that the short - term rapid variations seemed uncorrelated between antenna , if , and scan , and used this to crudely estimate our uncertainties from gain transfer calibration .    in this appendix",
    "we provide a more detailed analysis of the uncertainties associated with this calibration technique . for a given antenna ,",
    "assume we have corrected the complex antenna gain ratio , leaving some residual error @xmath34 in amplitude and @xmath35 in phase . under these circumstances ,",
    "the residual , uncorrected gain ratio can be written for antenna @xmath36 as @xmath37 where both @xmath34 and @xmath35 are on the order of 0.005 with the largest contributions from rapid , uncorrelated variations . in the stokes",
    "@xmath38 visibilities , these errors show up , to first order , multiplying the total intensity : @xmath39\\ ] ]    here we consider amplitude errors , as only they show up on the phase center and may be confused for a real circularly polarized signal . for point - like sources , phase errors will not contribute to first order , and for sources with significant extended structure , phase errors will appear in an anti - symmetric fashion about the phase center .",
    "the total uncertainty from gain transfer , @xmath40 , in the fractional circular polarization includes contributions to @xmath34 from three sources : ( 1 ) uncertainty in the determination of the smoothed antenna gains , ( 2 ) uncertainty in the true circular polarization of the calibrator sources , and ( 3 ) uncorrected rapid variations in the antenna gain ratios .",
    "is estimated by examining the scan to scan variations of the thirteen sources used to determine the average gains .",
    "we computed the rms variation in the individual gains from the six hour boxcar average determined on these sources . before computing the rms , we took a direct average of the variations across all ifs for each scan . this is to avoid having to make any assumptions about the degree of correlation in the variations between ifs higher than simply assuming the four ifs were completely uncorrelated in their variations . ] .",
    "we found an rms variation for the calibrators of @xmath41 .",
    "the uncertainty in any given six hour average is given by @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the number of scans in that averaging period , and the contribution to the circular polarization of a target source is @xmath44 for these observations the number of antennas , @xmath45 , was nine .",
    "the number of independent averages , @xmath46 , which apply to a given source was taken to be two as each source was observed over a period of five to six hours on each of the two days of the experiment .",
    "the average numbers of calibrator scans , @xmath43 , contributing to the gains applied to each source were computed and are listed in table [ t : errors ] .",
    "is easily estimated by finding the rms apparent cp of the calibrators and dividing by the square root of the number of calibrators contributing to a given gain average : @xmath47 for these observations , the rms peak circular polarization of the calibrators was @xmath48 .",
    "as each source ( targets and calibrators alike ) was observed over a five to six hour period on each day , and the gain averages are done over a six hour interval , each source overlaps with many calibrator sources . unfortunately , the contributions of each of these calibrator sources were not equal , and we needed to use a weighted average computed from the experiment schedule and listed in table [ t : errors ] .",
