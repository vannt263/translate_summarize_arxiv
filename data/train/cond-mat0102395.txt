    "the density - matrix - renormalisation - group ( dmrg ) is a powerful numerical tool which was developed by white @xcite to investigate one - dimensional quantum chains . since then it has been applied to several problems in quantum and classical physics @xcite .",
    "dmrg studies of one - dimensional stochastic processes represent a relatively new field of interest .",
    "such models can be described in terms of a non - symmetric stochastic hamiltonian @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the treatment of non - symmetric matrices within a dmrg algorithm @xcite is a more challenging task than that of quantum systems .",
    "carlon @xcite have systematically studied the application of the `` classical '' dmrg to reaction - diffusion models .",
    "they showed that it is possible to obtain accurate results for non - equilibrium phase transitions and their critical properties .",
    "we propose here a different dmrg approach to study stochastic models , namely the transfer - matrix dmrg ( tmrg ) .",
    "this method has first been applied to two - dimensional classical systems by nishino @xcite .",
    "xiang @xcite used the tmrg to investigate the quantum transfer - matrix of one - dimensional quantum systems and introduced an accurate method for studying thermodynamic properties @xcite .",
    "as an example we choose the domany - kinzel cellular automaton ( dkca ) @xcite which exhibits a non - equilibrium phase transition in the universality class of directed percolation ( dp ) @xcite .",
    "its phase diagram and critical properties are well known from previous studies , cf .",
    "@xcite for a review .",
    "we compare these literature data to our tmrg results to demonstrate their accuracy .",
    "important advantages of our approach over dmrg and monte - carlo simulations ( mcs ) are pointed out , especially for systems like the dkca for which the infinite time limit ( @xmath1 ) and the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath2 ) do not commute .",
    "cellular automata are algorithms that map one discrete configuration of a lattice to a new one in discrete time steps .",
    "usually the map can be decomposed into local update rules . in the following",
    "we introduce the dkca which is an example of a stochastic cellular automaton .",
    "the dkca @xcite is defined on a periodically closed chain of @xmath3 sites .",
    "each site @xmath4 can take the values @xmath5 .",
    "a configuration of the chain can be interpreted as a vector @xmath6 in a `` hilbert - space '' .",
    "we speak of dead ( @xmath7 ) and active ( @xmath8 ) sites",
    ". the local update rules of a site @xmath9 are given by certain conditional transition probabilities @xmath10 which depend only on the neighbouring sites @xmath11 .",
    "the model is controlled by three independent parameters @xmath12 where @xmath13 .",
    "the dkca is defined by @xmath14 .",
    "we are interested in the time evolution of an initial probability distribution @xmath15 of lattice states .",
    "the phases of the model are characterised by the properties of the stationary distribution @xmath16 .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath17 can be regarded as a vector @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the probability of a state @xmath20 at time step @xmath21 .",
    "the phase diagram differs , whether we consider a finite or infinite chain length @xmath3 . for a finite system",
    "only one phase occurs for arbitrary @xmath22 .",
    "any initial state @xmath23 decays exponentially fast to the stationary state @xmath24 which consists of dead sites only .",
    "@xmath25 is referred to as an _ absorbing state _ of the model because the system can not escape from @xmath25 due to @xmath14 . however , the situation changes in the thermodynamic limit @xmath2 . for sufficiently large @xmath26 and",
    "@xmath27 an arbitrary initial state @xmath28 evolves into an unique stationary state @xmath29 .",
    "thus we observe two phases , an _ absorbing _ and _ active _ one , separated by a sharp transition which falls into the dp universality class .",
    "consider an arbitrary curve @xmath30 @xmath31 in the phase diagram @xmath32 .",
    "an order parameter for the transition from the active to the absorbing phase is given by the local density of active sites @xmath33 with @xmath34 and the local number operator @xmath35 . in the absorbing phase @xmath36",
    "vanishes in the limit @xmath1 , while in the active phase @xmath36 saturates at some stationary value @xmath37 .",
    "close to the phase transition point @xmath38 a power law behaviour @xmath39 is observed .",
    "in contrast to equilibrium systems without dynamical aspects , critical phenomena in non - equilibrium systems are usually characterised by two correlation lengths @xmath40 in space and time respectively .",
    "close to a phase transition point these correlation lengths diverge as @xmath41 the dp universality class is already determined by the triple @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "two other critical exponents @xmath43 and @xmath44 are used in this work .",
    "choosing @xmath45 , the dynamic evolution of @xmath36 scales as @xmath46 and the response of @xmath37 to an `` external field '' @xmath47 as @xmath48 @xmath43 and @xmath44 can be related to @xmath49 and @xmath50 using scaling theory @xcite : @xmath51",
    "we first map the dkca onto a two - dimensional classical system which can be solved using a transfer - matrix formulation . in the thermodynamic limit @xmath2 the properties of the model",
    "can be inferred from the knowledge of certain eigenvalues and -vectors of the transfer - matrix .",
    "the tmrg algorithm calculates this dominating part of the spectrum .",
    "the local update probabilities of a site @xmath9 only depend on the neighbouring sites @xmath11 .",
    "hence , we use a sub - lattice ( parallel ) update .",
    "an update time step @xmath52 is divided into two sub - steps updating the sub - lattice of odd and even sites separately .",
    "depicts a realization of the update .",
    "the sites are connected by two state bonds .",
    "a bond is present ( full line ) , if the predecessor @xmath11 of a site @xmath9 is active , or not present ( dotted line ) otherwise .",
    "as shown in , the bonds form a two - dimensional square lattice @xmath53 .",
    "a configuration @xmath54 of the lattice decomposes into vertices @xmath55 which can be in eight different states .",
    "these are shown in together with the probabilities assigned to them .",
    "various properties of the stochastic system can now be expressed in terms of the statistical mechanics of a two - dimensional vertex model .",
    "for determining the critical behaviour we are mainly interested in the order parameter @xmath56 @xmath57 denotes the probability of a certain lattice configuration @xmath58 and corresponds to the statistical weight in a vertex model .",
    "@xmath59 measures the state of a certain lattice site , cf .  .",
    "thus the calculation of @xmath36 requires taking the average @xmath60 of a local operator @xmath61 in a vertex model .",
    "note that we have periodic boundary conditions in space direction @xmath3 , but open ones in time direction @xmath21 .",
    "we briefly recall some basic facts of the transfer - matrix formulation of two - dimensional classical systems .",
    "the idea is to transform the sum over all configurations in into a product of transfer - matrices .",
    "the vertex model representing the dynamics of the dkca has a checkerboard - like structure , cf .  .",
    "each dashed square tags a vertex and defines a local transfer matrix @xmath62 the ( vertical ) transfer - matrix @xmath63 of a certain time step @xmath21 is defined by the matrix elements @xmath64 in the open boundary conditions in @xmath21-direction are considered by summing out @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "note that this definition is similar to the so - called quantum transfer matrix used in @xcite for quantum systems .",
    "in contrast to the horizontal transfer matrix in @xmath3-direction , @xmath63 is not a stochastic matrix .",
    "for the calculation of the order parameter another matrix @xmath69 is needed which contains one modified local transfer matrix ( see ) @xmath70 using @xmath63 and @xmath69 it can be easily shown that @xmath71 under the assumption that the highest eigenvalue @xmath72 of @xmath63 is not degenerate , the thermodynamic limit @xmath2 can be performed exactly @xmath73 @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) denotes the right ( left ) eigenvector of the non - symmetric transfer matrix @xmath63 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath72 .",
    "the tmrg calculates @xmath72 and the corresponding left and right eigenvector for an arbitrary matrix size @xmath21 .",
    "this is done iteratively by numerical renormalisation techniques .",
    "we do not go into the details of the algorithm , which is basically the same used for the quantum transfer - matrix in @xcite .",
    "two important modifications are necessary :    * open boundary conditions in time direction @xmath21 are used in .",
    "these are necessary as the dkca is not translationally invariant in time . in contrast , the corresponding trotter dimension in quantum - tmrg is periodically closed @xcite . *",
    "the density matrix @xmath76 used in quantum - tmrg is not symmetric where @xmath77 denotes the partial trace over the environmental block . using @xmath78 for the dkca",
    ", we observed a poor convergence of the tmrg algorithm .",
    "following @xcite we restricted ourselves to the symmetric density matrix @xmath79 the convergence of the algorithm was improved remarkably .",
    "the eigenvectors @xmath74 and @xmath75 of @xmath63 were calculated by a power method .",
    "the diagonalisation of the density matrix was done by using maple which can in principle handle arbitrary numerical precision .",
    "the data presented in the following section have been obtained by keeping @xmath80 states .",
    "in the absorbing phase @xmath36 decreases exponentially fast to zero , whereas @xmath81 in the active phase . at the transition point",
    "@xmath82 we expect a power law behaviour .",
    "( left ) presents a double - logarithmic plot of @xmath83 along a curve @xmath30 in the phase diagram @xmath32 . as an example we used the site - directed percolation ( sdp ) line @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath38 is determined by adjusting @xmath85 until the curvature of @xmath36 in the double - logarithmic plot vanishes .",
    "this was done for various lines @xmath86 to calculate the complete transition line , cf .",
    "( right ) .",
    "in a second step we estimated @xmath37 in the active phase by a @xmath87 finite - size scaling .    depicts the results we obtained for the sdp line and the line @xmath88 . within the phases our data are in excellent agreement with mcs . only close to the critical point we observe a small deviation .",
    "here the @xmath87-scaling becomes less accurate due to critical slowing down .",
    "we expect that other methods , i.e.  vbs or bst @xcite , provide better results .",
    "the critical exponents @xmath43 , @xmath89 and @xmath44 determine the universality class , cf .  .",
    "we exemplify the calculation of the exponents by investigating the sdp line .",
    "depicts for the order parameter ( a ) its time - dependence @xmath36 , ( b ) the stationary value @xmath37 and ( c ) the stationary value @xmath90 in the presence of a `` field '' @xmath91 with @xmath85 close to @xmath38 .",
    "the linear regression slope of a double - logarithmic plot ( see insets ) yields the particular exponent . compares the results with other data obtained by series expansion and mcs .",
    "the accuracy of the exponents is similar to the dmrg calculations done by carlon @xcite .",
    "@cccc critical & series & mcs & tmrg + exponent & @xcite & @xcite & ( this work ) + @xmath89 & 0.276486(8 ) & 0.27649(4)&0.276(5 ) + @xmath50 & 1.733847(6 ) & 1.73383(3 ) & + @xmath92 & 1.096854(4 ) & 1.09684(1 ) & + @xmath43 & 0.159464(5 ) & 0.15946(2)&0.156(5 ) + @xmath93&0.10825(2)&0.10825(2)&0.108(5 ) +",
    "in this letter we have proposed a new approach to stochastic models using tmrg .",
    "the accuracy of the results were shown by comparison to mcs or literature data .",
    "critical exponents were estimated which deviate from the currently accepted values @xcite by less than 3% . in the following we focus on three important advantages of tmrg compared to traditional mcs or dmrg calculations .",
    "first , the exact treatment of the thermodynamic limit of the chain is the main aspect of the tmrg presented here .",
    "in contrast , mcs and dmrg can only be applied to finite chains .",
    "thus a finite - size scaling has to be used carefully to estimate the thermodynamic limit @xmath2 . for transitions into absorbing states",
    "@xmath2 does usually not commute with the infinite time limit @xmath1 . as shown in ,",
    "@xmath2 can be performed exactly within the transfer - matrix formulation .",
    "second , the tmrg approach facilitates a proper investigation of the dynamic evolution of the system ( i.e.  @xmath36 ) .",
    "this is a more difficult task using mcs .",
    "many samples have to be taken into account to obtain a reasonable average .",
    "in contrast , the dmrg and tmrg approaches do not require random numbers and averaging like the mcs .",
    "the dmrg algorithm basically calculates the ground state of the stochastic hamiltonian @xmath0 which corresponds to the steady state ( @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "dynamic properties are available by analysing the gap of @xmath0 .",
    "thus the second eigenvalue of @xmath0 has to be computed .",
    "critical properties are then extracted from the finite - size data of the gap @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the tmrg offers direct access to the dynamics and phase transition of the model by calculating one eigenvalue only .",
    "the third advantage is a rather technical one .",
    "we obtained surprisingly accurate results by modest numerical efforts . in comparison",
    ", the classical dmrg algorithm needs more sophisticated numerical techniques to guarantee a sufficient convergence @xcite .",
    "we expect a further improvement of our results by involving various numerical refinements , i.e.  a modified arnoldi method @xcite or a bst finite size scaling @xcite",
    ".    the tmrg approach can be generalized to study other stochastic processes with arbitrary dynamics .",
    "currently we investigate the pair contact process with diffusion ( pcpd ) and compare tmrg and dmrg results @xcite .",
    "the universality class of the model is still unknown and an interesting field of research @xcite .",
    "the authors have benefited from intensive discussions with r.  raupach , who placed his tmrg program for quantum systems to our disposal .",
