    "charged quantum particles in magnetic fields exhibit important phenomena , not least of which is the famous quantum hall ( qh ) effect  @xcite , in which the quantised hall conductance is related to robust chiral edge states and non - zero topological band invariants  @xcite .",
    "although first studied in solid - state materials , there has been great progress in exploring qh physics also with ultracold atoms  @xcite , photons  @xcite , classical circuits  @xcite and mechanical systems  @xcite , where the magnetic field effects must be engineered artificially  @xcite .    an exciting development in this direction",
    "has been the introduction of the ",
    "synthetic dimension \" concept into ultracold atomic gases  @xcite and photonics  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "discrete internal degrees of freedom are reinterpreted as labelling lattice sites along an additional _ synthetic _ dimension ; by externally - coupling together these degrees of freedom , particles can be understood to  hop \" between lattice sites and so move along this extra dimension . when combined with other ( real ) spatial dimensions , artificial magnetic fields can be imprinted by spatially varying the external coupling  @xcite .    in ultracold gases , a synthetic dimension",
    "can be implemented by using different internal atomic states as the lattice sites , with an inter - site coupling and artificial magnetic flux controlled by external raman lasers  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , this was demonstrated for atoms in a 1d optical lattice with three internal states , effectively simulating a three - leg ladder pierced by a uniform magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "however , this approach faces significant challenges :  it is technically demanding to couple more internal states and so the synthetic dimension is extremely short ; this scheme strongly relies on the available atomic species and on the practical constraints imposed by the atom - light coupling ; tunneling matrix elements along the synthetic dimension are highly non - uniform due to clebsch - gordan coefficients associated with atomic transitions ; and interactions are typically independent of the internal state and so of the  separation \" in the synthetic dimension .",
    "this contrasts with real dimensions , where interactions decay with inter - particle distance . in such synthetic dimensions ,",
    "the state - independent (  zero - dimensional \" ) interactions preclude the realization of fractional qh liquids  @xcite .      in this work ,",
    "we introduce a simple and versatile scheme for implementing synthetic dimensions , which only requires two basic ingredients : the harmonic potential , which is anyway present in experiments to confine the atoms , combined with a periodic shaking of the trap  @xcite . here , sites along the synthetic dimension are indexed by the harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) eigenstates quantum number @xmath0 , while motion between sites is controlled by the time - modulation [ fig .  [ fig:1 ]  ( a ) ] . the phase of this modulation can be used to straightforwardly imprint an artificial magnetic field when the system is extended by a second dimension , e.g.  by a 1d optical lattice as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ]  ( b ) .",
    "we demonstrate that this artificial gauge field has important consequences , such as an unusual reduction in the average energy despite resonant driving ( as illustrated in section  [ section_reduction ] ) , or robust one - way transport .",
    "for example , consider a cloud of atoms that is suitably prepared in the lowest - lying harmonic oscillator states ( @xmath1 ) and trapped in some region of an optical lattice directed along a transverse ( @xmath2 ) direction [ fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ]  ( b ) ] : due to the artificial magnetic field defined in the abstract @xmath3 plane , the cloud will undergo a chiral motion along the  real \" 1d lattice , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ]  ( b ) .",
    "only once the atoms reach the  corner \" of the system at @xmath4 , will the cloud stop its propagation along @xmath2 and will the average energy begin to increase as the atoms are driven to higher harmonic oscillator states .",
    "this is directly analogous to the motion of a wave packet propagating chirally around the edge of a 2d quantum hall system ( here defined in the abstract @xmath3 plane ) .",
    "our scheme is very general and will be directly applicable in ultracold atoms  @xcite . furthermore , it offers practical advantages over many current qh ultracold gas experiments  @xcite as it does not require the use of addressable internal states nor 2d ( super)lattice potentials .",
    "this scheme will be well suited to measuring quantized hall conductivity in cold - atom setups with constriction - based channels  @xcite , where a 1d optical lattice may be easily designed .",
    "our proposed implementation also overcomes the aforementioned limitations :  many ho eigenstates can be potentially coupled , leading to a long synthetic dimension ; this scheme is independent of the available atomic species ; tunneling matrix elements are approximately uniform in the large @xmath0 limit ; and the interactions decay with the  separation \" along the synthetic dimension , raising the possibility of accessing genuine 2d correlated states ( e.g.  fractional qh states ) when combined with a real dimension .",
    "our proposal also opens a way to practically realize higher - dimensional topological physics  @xcite , even up to six spatial dimensions  @xcite .",
    "we note that the dimensional crossover associated with the progressive population of harmonic - trap modes was recently investigated in ref .",

    "this underlines again how the micro - motion becomes irrelevant as one enters the high - frequency regime @xmath87 .",
    "going further , we point out that the rotating - frame transformation in eq .   also leads to a micro - motion when moving back to the original ( laboratory ) frame .",

    "hence , for sufficiently large laser intensity @xmath259 and waist @xmath258 , the potential felt by the atoms is well approximated by a harmonic potential , with the identification v _ ( x ) = m ^2 ^2 = ( ) ^2 , in order to estimate the effects of anharmonicity in our synthetic - dimension scheme , which is mainly due to the quartic correction in eq .  , we write the corresponding operator in the harmonic - oscillator - eigenstates basis ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "this perturbing effect gives two contributions to the total hamiltonian in eq .",
