    "early  type galaxies ( etg ) contain most of the visible mass in the universe @xcite and are thought to reside in the highest density peaks of the underlying dark matter distribution .",
    "therefore , understanding their evolution is crucial for understanding the evolution of galaxies and structures in general . in the 3-dimensional space of their main parameters ( the effective radius @xmath6 , the central velocity dispersion @xmath7 , and the average surface luminosity within @xmath6 , @xmath8 ) , etg concentrate on a plane thus called the fundamental plane ( fp , djorgowski & davis 1987 ; dressler et al . 1987 ) .",
    "this implies that , besides being in virial equilibrium , etg show a striking regularity in their structures and stellar populations ( e.g. , renzini & ciotti 1993 ) , which allows , at least at a first order , to use their main observables for deriving the galaxy mass and @xmath9 ratio . for instance , assuming @xmath10 homology , the mass is given by ( michard 1980 ; see also cappellari et al .",
    "2005 ) :    @xmath11    moreover , the slope of the fp can be interpreted as a systematic variation of the @xmath9 ratio along the plane by a factor of @xmath12 ( e.g. , ciotti , lanzoni & renzini 1996 ) . at high redshift the fp is known to stay thin , and its intercept shows an offset with respect to the local one that corresponds to a change in @xmath9 consistent with passive luminosity evolution ( see renzini 2006 and references therein ) . if ascribed to differences in the stellar populations , the observed changes in the @xmath9 ratio can be used to infer the ages of etg .",
    "we report on a comparative analysis of the best data on the fundamental parameters of etg at @xmath0@xmath11 , the highest redshift for which these data are currently available , obtained from recent spectroscopic observations with 8 - 10 m class telescopes , complemented with deep imaging with the hubble space telescope . using the universe as a time machine and profiting from the large leverage provided by the redshift",
    ", we infer ages for etg and analyse them as a function of galaxy mass and environment .",
    "we assume a flat universe with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 s@xmath16 , and we use magnitudes based on the vega system .",
    "recent studies @xcite of the fp of etg in the field at @xmath0@xmath11 , in the rest - frame b - band , down to relatively faint luminosities ( @xmath17 ) , and hence small masses , demonstrate that , in addition to the offset , the fp at @xmath0@xmath11 also shows a different slope .",
    "this implies that the galaxy @xmath4 ratio evolves with redshift in a way that depends on the galaxy mass . by comparing the @xmath4 ratio of field etg to that of massive ( @xmath18 ) etg in clusters ,",
    "a faster evolution of @xmath4 for the less massive galaxies has been derived , and it is interpreted as a manifestation of downsizing , i.e. the tendency of smaller galaxies to have later or more prolonged star formation histories than the massive ones @xcite .",
    "very recently the high - z fp of the etg has been studied in two clusters ( rx j0152.7@xmath191357 at z=0.835 and rx j1226.9@xmath193332 at z=0.892 ) , reaching a similarly faint limiting absolute magnitude ( @xmath20 ) , also in the rest - frame b - band @xcite .",
    "this has pointed out that , also in the clusters , the slope of the fp changes with redshift , a manifestation of downsizing even in high density environments .",
    "unfortunately , because of an error in the calibration of the galaxy luminosities used by @xcite , the photometry for the two clusters should be offset to brighter luminosities with a factor @xmath21 .",
    "correcting for this error corresponds to an offset in @xmath22 to brighter luminosities with @xmath23 , which is 0.26 and 0.28 for rx j0152.71357 ( @xmath24 ) and rx j1226.9 + 3332 ( @xmath25 ) respectively .",
    "therefore the cluster data , which we have used in the published version of this letter ( apj 647 , l99 ) , should be changed and we present here a corrected version of our original letter ( see also the erratum to apj 647 , l99 ) .",
    "we make a uniform comparison of these results on the high redshift fp ( fig . 1 ) and on the consequent variations of the @xmath4 ratio ( fig .",
    "2 ) , both in the field , by using the samples of @xcite and of @xcite , and in the clusters , by using the sample of @xcite . as a reference in the local universe , we use new data for the coma cluster @xcite .",
    "the figures show that the change in @xmath4 between etg at high redshift and the local ones decreases with the galaxy mass and is very similar in the clusters and in the field .",
    "however , since the clusters are at a slightly lower redshift , a deeper analysis is necessary to show this more clearly .",
    "the usual way to achieve this purpose is to compare the @xmath4 ratio of the high redshift etg with the corresponding ratio obtained for massive ( @xmath26 ) cluster etg at the same redshift , as compiled and parameterized by @xcite .",
    "however this analysis is unsatisfactory , since the massive cluster etg are not necessarily a uniform class , and , by construction , such a procedure prevents one from studying the lower mass cluster galaxies .",
    "what is of interest is how the star formation history of etg , or at least their average stellar age , depends on both galaxy mass and environment .",
    "we analyse this by interpreting the changes in @xmath4 as differences in the ages of the stellar populations , and that this evolution correlates with the rest - frame @xmath27 colour , thereby providing independent evidence for changes in the stellar populations @xcite . ] .",
    "while the star formation histories of some etg could have had multiple episodes of star formation @xcite , we can only estimate luminosity weighted average stellar ages , by using single stellar population models .",
    "we therefore infer galaxy ages using the relation between @xmath4 and age obtained by evolutionary population synthesis models ( maraston 2005 , see also http://www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/@xmath1maraston/sspn/ml/ ) , and assuming that the model stellar mass is proportional to the dynamical mass obtained from equation ( 1 ) . since the @xmath9age relation depends both on the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) and on the metallicity , we adopt a @xcite imf , which is known to better reproduce the characteristics of low and high redshift galaxies .",
    "moreover we estimate the galaxy metallicity from the observed velocity dispersion following thomas et al .",
    "( 2005 ; see also annibali et al .",
    "2006 ) , and we assume that this relationship does do not evolve with redshift , as in the case of passive evolution . given the values of @xmath28 and metallicity for every galaxy in our sample , ages have been inferred by means of a spline interpolation of the population synthesis model results .",
    "then , the lookback time to formation has been derived by using the universe as a time machine and exploiting the large leverage provided by the considerable distance of the observed etg .",
    "the uncertainties on the age estimates have been computed taking into account the known errors in @xmath28 , as well as the uncertainties on the estimated metallicities , due to the known errors in the velocity dispersion measurements and to the observed scatter in the metallicity vs. velocity dispersion relation @xcite .",
    "the resulting formation epochs of etg are shown in figure 3 as a function of galaxy mass , both for the cluster and for the field environment .",
    "the estimated ages for the two brightest cluster galaxies ( # 1567 in rxj0152.7 - 1357 , and # 563 in rxj1226.9 + 3332 @xcite ) , are @xmath29 and @xmath30 gyr , respectively , and are not included in fig . 3 ( see below for a discussion about these large ages ) . a clear and important result is the lack of young massive etg .",
    "in particular all etg with @xmath31 have a lookback time to formation larger than 10 gyr and have a formation redshift larger than 2 .",
    "clearly this can not be the result of a selection effect , since relatively young massive etg could not escape from the available surveys .",
    "confirming the analysis of the evolution of @xmath4 given at the beginning of this section , we find that more massive galaxies are older than lower mass ones in all environments , and that cluster galaxies have the same age within 5% as field galaxies with the same mass , in the whole mass range ( see fig .",
    "a similar dependence of the age on the mass has already been obtained by an analysis of the absorption line indices of a sample of local etg @xcite .",
    "however thomas et al .",
    "( 2005 ) find that etg in clusters are older than those in the field by about 2 gyr .",
    "given the number of objects in the samples that we have examined and the errors in the estimate of their age , we should have seen such a systematic age difference , if it were present in the data that we have used .",
    "we argue that using the universe as a time machine should be more powerful than `` archaeology '' on local galaxies , since galaxies are caught closer to the action .",
    "interestingly , also the coma etg show the downsizing effect , and their formation redshifts are very consistent with those of @xmath0@xmath11 etg @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath0@xmath11 samples examined here are not much affected by the progenitor bias @xcite .",
    "thus , our results suggest that the first etg to form are the most massive ones independently of the environment .",
    "although the absolute ages that we derive are somewhat model dependent , are affected by an approximate metallicity estimate , and obviously depend also on the adopted cosmological parameters , we stress that the _ trends of age differences _ between high redshift and local etg , and between galaxies with different masses and in different environments are much more robust .",
    "one of the uncertainties affecting the age estimates derives from the assumption of structural homology when computing masses through equation ( 1 ) .",
    "it is well known that etg show a systematic departure from homology , both locally @xcite and at @xmath0@xmath11 @xcite and that more precise dynamical masses can be obtained taking these deviations into account , using the srsic ( 1968 ) profile , to describe the observed surface brightness distribution , instead of the @xmath10 law @xcite .",
    "these mass estimates can be up to @xmath32 higher than those obtained assuming homology for the low mass galaxies , but can also be lower by up to 20% for the high mass galaxies @xcite .",
    "unfortunately we do not have srsic indices for all the etg examined here , but we have checked on the k20 field samples of @xcite that the ages estimated by taking non homology into account do not vary substantially from those given in fig . 3 and 4 , computed using eq . ( 1 )",
    "since the brightest cluster galaxies are known to deviate from the @xmath10 profile , and if the influence of dark matter increases in high mass galaxies , these factors could lead to an overestimate of the the ages of the most massive etg in the cluster sample .",
    "the influence of selection effects is shown by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "2 , which represent the magnitude limit of the k20 field samples of @xcite and of the two high redshift clusters of @xcite . these samples are affected by selection only for @xmath33 , while the different slope in the high redshift samples compared to the local one is clearly visible also for larger masses , thus can not be totally due to selection effects ( see also @xcite ) .    very recently the largest high resolution simulation of the growth of cosmic structure in the hierarchical formation scenario ( the millennium run , springel et al .",
    "2005 ) has been used to study how the ages of etg depend on environment and on galaxy mass @xcite . in this model , since merging of smaller galaxies is an important ingredient for the formation of etg , the galaxy formation time , which is when most of its stars formed , and the galaxy assembly time , which is when stars assembled in the single galaxy that we observe , are considered separately @xcite .",
    "our dating based on changes in the @xmath4 ratio relates to when the stars formed , rather than to when they assembled .",
    "the semi - analytic hierarchical model of @xcite is able to reproduce the already known result , i.e. that the formation times are earlier for more massive etg , although the downsizing effect is considerably steeper in the model than in the data ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , but clearly predicts that cluster galaxies should be older than field galaxies , which is not what we observe .",
