    "<S> when e modes are present on all scales the separation of all of the b signal is no longer possible : there are inevitably ambiguous modes that can not be separated . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the practicality of performing e / b decomposition on large scales with realistic non - symmetric sky - cuts , and show that separation on large scales is possible by retaining only the well supported modes . </S>",
    "<S> the large scale modes potentially contain a great deal of useful information , and e / b separation at the level of the map is essential for clean detection of b without confusion from cosmic variance due to the e signal . </S>",
    "<S> we give simple matrix manipulations for creating pure e and b maps of the large scale signal for general sky cuts . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the method works well in a realistic case and give estimates of the performance with data from the planck satellite . in the appendix </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the simple analytic case of an azimuthally symmetric cut , and show that exact e / b separation is possible on an azimuthally symmetric cut with a finite number of non - intersecting circular cuts around foreground sources .    </S>",
    "<S> observations of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) provide information about primordial inhomogeneities in the universe </S>",
    "<S> . one of the most interesting questions is whether there was a tensor ( gravitational wave ) component . </S>",
    "<S> cmb polarization measurements offer a probe of this signal  @xcite via the ` magnetic ' component of the polarization map . </S>",
    "<S> this offers the opportunity to distinguish between different models of single field inflation , which generically predict a significant amplitude of gravitational waves , and other competing models which predict nearly zero amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> for example the ekpyrotic scenario generically predicts exponentially small amplitudes of tensor modes , as do inflation models where density perturbations originate from fluctuations in a second scalar field .    </S>",
    "<S> polarization of the cosmic microwave sky is produced by electron scattering , as photons decouple from the primordial plasma and during reionization . </S>",
    "<S> gravitational waves produce ` magnetic ' ( b ) and ` electric ' ( e ) polarization components at a comparable level by anisotropic redshifting of the energy of photons . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic polarization is not produced by linear scalar ( density ) perturbations , so detection of a magnetic component would provide strong direct evidence for the presence of a primordial gravitational wave ( tensor ) component . </S>",
    "<S> there is a non - linear contribution to the magnetic signal from gravitational lensing of e polarization , though on the scales where the tensor mode signal is large the lensing signal is sufficiently small that it is negligible for observations up to planck sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> however ultimately the lensing signal ( and how well it can be subtracted ) may provide a limit on the amplitude of tensor modes that can be detected  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are also a variety of other possible sources for tensor and vector modes generating a b mode signature  @xcite , as well as numerous systematics  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> inflationary models generically predict a gaussian spectrum of linear e and b modes , in which case it is possible to use the full likelihood function to constrain the tensor amplitude without separating into e and b modes . however if there are any departures from gaussianity , e.g. due to systematics , foregrounds , magnetic fields  @xcite , defects  @xcite or unexpected physics , this could give misleading answers . </S>",
    "<S> so it is useful to have methods to separate out pure b modes for robust detections and isolation of unexpected features . for small </S>",
    "<S> tensor amplitudes any mixture of e and b modes would be dominated by the scalar e signal , and a joint analysis for the tensor contribution would be only marginally more optimal than using only the pure b modes .    on small scales </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to provide excellent separation of the e and b mode power spectra using fast quadratic estimators  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these methods provide estimators which , when averaged over realizations , give zero if there really is no b signal . </S>",
    "<S> however in any given realization , such as the one we observe , there will in general be a non - zero b signal . </S>",
    "<S> this is a potential obstacle to clean e / b power spectrum separation on the large scales where cosmic variance is most important .    </S>",
    "<S> cmb observations by wmap have recently indicated a substantial optical depth to reionization  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if confirmed this would imply that detection of magnetic polarization could be achieved by observation of a relatively small number of high signal to noise b modes on large scales ( corresponding to the horizon size at reionization ) . </S>",
    "<S> the large scales are just where cosmic variance is largest , and the effect of incompleteness of the map ( e.g. due to cuts around the galaxy and foreground sources ) makes the e and b modes harder to separate . </S>",
    "<S> there is therefore clear motivation for methods to cleanly separate the e and b modes on the largest scales , avoiding problems with cosmic - variance mixing that arises from the use of quadratic estimators , and extracting the b modes without assumptions about their distribution . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we discuss various harmonic methods for performing e / b separation , equivalent to separation at the level of the map . </S>",
    "<S> we start in section  [ eb ] with a brief summary of the e / b decomposition . in section  [ harmonics ] </S>",
    "<S> we review the tensor harmonics and how the e / b mixing enters for observations over only part of the sky , and discuss the theoretical properties of the coupling matrices . in section  [ separation ] </S>",
    "<S> we show how to separate the modes for band limited and non - band limited fields with arbitrary sky cuts , and show that the method presented in earlier work  @xcite is optimal for general cuts in the all - scales limit . for non - band limited fields </S>",
    "<S> there are ambiguous modes than can not be separated . </S>",
    "<S> we then show how the large scale reionization magnetic modes can be extracted from a realistic map by retaining only the well supported modes . </S>",
    "<S> the method is computationally tractable and close to exact , and should allow robust detection of the large scale magnetic signal with future cmb polarization observations . in section  [ planckex ] </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the performance explicitly for a complicated sky cut geometry , and provide comparative estimates of the ability of the planck satellite to detect tensor modes using different methods . in the appendix we review some analytic results for azimuthal cuts from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , show that exact separation is possible for non - intersecting combinations of azimuthal cuts , and give a slightly improved matrix method for extracting the pure e and b modes exactly .    for a method similar to the general method presented here , but working explicitly in pixel space , see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and other related work in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> though we only discuss cmb polarization maps explicitly , the techniques could be applied to other data , for example shear distributions in weak lensing surveys . </S>",
    "<S> indeed b modes in the lensing of pre - reionization gas may provide a good alternative way to detect tensor modes  @xcite . </S>"
