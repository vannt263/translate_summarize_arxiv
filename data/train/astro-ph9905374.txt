    "kroto et al . ( 1985 ) proposed that the fullerene molecule c@xmath2 and related species play an important role in interstellar physics and chemistry .",
    "this argument is based on the stability of the `` buckyball '' structure of fullerene compounds , as observed in the laboratory and confirmed by ab - initio calculations ( see also kroto 1987 , 1988 and references therein ) .",
    "the formation mechanisms invoked to produce such spherical carbonaceous structures are usually based on reactions in circumstellar shells , with precursors such as acetylene and corannulene ( goeres and seldmayr 1992 ; kroto and jura 1992 ; bettens et al .",
    "another way of obtaining fullerenes , together with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , is the photoerosion of larger hydrogenated amorphous carbon grains ( scott et al . 1997 ) .",
    "fullerene or fullerane species have been searched for at various wavelengths in interstellar spectra .",
    "they have also been proposed as explanations for many unidentified interstellar bands : the extinction bump at 2175  , the diffuse interstellar bands , the infrared emission features , and the extended red emission ( webster 1993a , b , c , 1996 ) .",

    "foing and ehrenfreund ( 1994 , 1997 ) have observed absorption features at 9577 and 9632  along a few lines of sight , which could correspond to these modes .",
    "this assignment of the two near - ir bands to c@xmath1 , however , is debated ( maier 1994 , jenniskens et al .",

    "the ir laboratory spectrum of c@xmath1 has been measured in a neon matrix ( fulara et al .",

    "we reproduce the laboratory spectrum in figure 2 , courtesy of the authors .",
    "two other bands are expected for symmetry reasons , but they have not been measured so far because their wavelengths are longer than the 16.7 @xmath0 m ( 600 @xmath8 ) cutoff of the fulara et al . experiment .",

    "1994 ) , compared to the cold neon matrix .    in a similar way , joblin et al .",

    "( 0 to 20 @xmath8 ) compared to absorption bands in a 4 k neon matrix .",
    "they also emphasize that the observed wavelengths of pah features shift to longer wavelength with increasing emission temperature .",
    "the amount of the wavelength shift varies between different vibrational modes of a pah , but the redshift is in the range of 0 to 0.1 @xmath0 m ( 0 to 20 @xmath8 ) compared to pahs at low temperature .",

    "it can nevertheless be expected that c@xmath1 features are broadened and shifted by 0 to 20 @xmath8 as well .",
    "the two c@xmath1 features we wish to detect are therefore expected to lie at 7.1  7.2 @xmath0 m and at 7.5  7.6 @xmath0 m .",
    "we have considered here two cases which are illustrated in figure 3 . in case a , we assume that other carbonaceous species , such as pahs or very small grains , emit the 6.2 , 7.7 , and 8.6 @xmath0 m emission features , and that the combined emission of these features can be treated as a local continuum",

    "a and case b , we adopt gaussian profiles with a fwhm of 0.05 @xmath0 m for the two c@xmath1 bands , and we place the constraint on any possible c@xmath1 features that the ratio of the integrated cross - section of the 7.11 @xmath0 m band to the integrated cross - section of the 7.51 @xmath0 m band equal the laboratory value of 2.2 ( fulara et al .",

    "the exciting star of the reflection nebula ngc 7023 is the be star hd 200775 , which has an effective temperature of 17000 k ( strom et al . 1972 ) . for detailed reviews of previous studies of this object , see lemaire et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and martini et al .",
    "our sws observations are higher spectral resolution than previously published mid - ir spectra of ngc 7023 from the kuiper airborne observatory ( sellgren et al .",
    "1985 ) and from iso with isophot - s and isocam ( laureijs et al . 1996 ; cesarsky et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the data presented here were taken by the sws spectrometer on board the iso satellite ( kessler et al . , 1996 ) during revolution 455 ( february 13th , 1997 ) .",
    "we used the partial grating scan mode ( aot6 , band 2c ) of the sws instrument ( de graauw et al .",
    "the position angle of the major axis of the sws rectangular aperture ( 14@xmath13 @xmath10 20@xmath13 for the wavelength range observed here ) was 258.5@xmath14 .",
    "the aperture is thus located at the southern edge of the northwestern filament observed by isocam ( as seen in the 6.2 to 11.3 @xmath0 m feature ratio , cesarsky et al . , 1996 ) and is parallel in orientation to this filament . in the sws grating spectrometer , light is dispersed along the major axis .",
    "data gathered by the sws spectrometer have a high redundancy : 12 detectors and two grating scan directions ( up and down hereafter ) , for a total of 24 individual spectral scans .",
    "there are two grating steps per spectral resolution element ( @xmath15 m ) ; each spectral resolution element is thus observed independently 48 times .    to reduce the data",
    ", we used the current sws - ia version running at the institut dastrophysique spatiale ( last update : october 1997 ) .",
    "the data reduction steps are summarized in de graauw et al .",
    "the flux calibration was done with the file cal25 - 2c-020 . in the following",
    ", we detail our modifications to the standard reduction scheme in order to improve the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio .",
    "first , we removed glitches due to cosmic rays from the spectra . for the band 2c detectors ,",
    "glitches rarely affect more than a single read - out ( 2 seconds ) . to detect glitches ,",
    "we subtract a continuum ( a sliding boxcar on 15 points , with 2-@xmath16 outliers rejected ) from each of the 24 individual scans , to create individual high - frequency ( hf ) scans .",
    "the individual hf scans , which now contain unresolved lines , glitches and noise , are combined by wavelength .",
    "the combined hf spectrum has 48 points per resolution element ; we smooth it with a 15-point sliding boxcar to improve our s / n on the combined hf signal while retaining enough spectral sampling to detect true hf features in the spectrum such as unresolved emission lines .",
    "we subtract the combined hf signal from each hf individual scan , leaving individual residual scans which in principle only contain noise and glitches .",
    "we finally remove glitches from each individual residual scan by 3-@xmath16 clipping , with @xmath16 determined locally from a 10-point sliding boxcar . between 10 and 20% of the data points were identified as glitches .",
    "second , we removed correlated noise , due to weaker glitches ( not necessarily due to cosmic rays like , e.g. , electrical noise ) which occur in all 12 detectors at the same time .",
    "correlated noise is not always detected by the above glitch removal technique , and can result in a false spectral feature which appears broader than the spectral resolution ( see sellgren et al .",
    "1999 ) . to eliminate correlated noise , we subtracted a continuum from each scan to create individual hf scans , as described above , but then combined the hf scans in the time domain ( at each reset point ) rather than in the wavelength domain .",
    "we next subtracted from each individual hf scan the mean hf signal ( after sigma - rejection ) of all 12 detectors taken at each reset point .",
    "the individual continuum is subsequently restored into each corrected hf scan .",
    "unresolved lines remain unaffected by this method as our sampling is dense enough . by applying this signal decorrelation",
    ", we reduced the rms noise by 5 to 15% .",
    "the two operations described above , to correct for glitches and correlated noise , were performed just after flux calibration . as they were performed on the hf part of the signal",
    "they do not depend on flatfield quality .",
    "the third step in the data reduction is the flatfielding .",
    "we used the standard sws flatfielding routine to scale all individual scans to a reference .",
    "the reference is defined by a linear fit to all 12 down scans .",
    "the scaling factor for each individual scan is defined as the reference divided by a linear fit to the individual scan . if an individual scan has some fit points close to zero , the scaling factor becomes large and the amplification of noise in the scan adversely affects the flatfield quality . to avoid this",
    ", we added a constant value ( 100 jy ) to all individual scans , performed the flatfield correction ( multiplication by the scaling factors ) , then subtracted this constant value to produce the final flux level .",
    "the final average spectrum was produced with a sliding boxcar on a given binsize ( 0.0042 @xmath0 m or mean resolving power of 1900 , valentijn et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "in order to be sure that the residual error includes any true differences between the up and down scans , we performed a second reduction in which we separated the up and down scans just before the flatfield operation .",
    "the two scan directions were then flatfielded completely independently .",
    "this was used only to calculate the residual error ( up @xmath17 down)/2 .",
    "we will now derive an upper limit on the c@xmath1 and c@xmath2 abundances , for both case a and case b. for this purpose , we compare the observed spectrum of ngc 7023 to a calculated emission spectrum of c@xmath1 .",
    "this is more rigorous than extracting a relative value of c@xmath1 emission compared to the pah emission , especially in the 7  8 @xmath0 m domain , where the spectroscopic match of pahs to the interstellar data is not yet proved .",
    "we will first show the detailed calculation for c@xmath1 , and then apply it to c@xmath2 .",
    "the c@xmath1 absorption spectrum we adopt for modeling purposes reproduces the bandwidths and relative intensities measured in laboratory experiments ( fulara et al .",
    "we use the wavelengths and relative intensities of the long - wavelength modes in c@xmath2 ( at 17.3 and 18.9 @xmath0 m ) to approximate these modes in c@xmath1 , since the long - wavelength modes of c@xmath1 are predicted but not yet measured . we assume the wavelengths of the c@xmath1 modes do not depend on temperature , because we can not predict this dependence ( although any wavelength shift is probably less than 0.1 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "it is important to note that the power emitted in the c@xmath1 features does not depend on the absolute value of the ir cross - section .",
    "the reason for this is energy conservation ; the total absorbed power is equal to the total emitted power , independent of the cooling time between uv photons .",
    "according to the thermal model ( sellgren 1984 , lger et al .",
    "1989 ) , the excitation of a species after a single uv or visible photon absorption raises its vibrational temperature to a high value , determined by its size via the heat capacity .",
    "the emission results from the cooling by vibrational decay . to calculate the ir emission spectrum of c@xmath1",
    ", we thus have to model its absorption of stellar light and its emission in the 7 @xmath0 m bands .    the total power absorbed by c@xmath1 molecules near a star is given by : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the illuminating stellar flux as a function of frequency @xmath20",
    ", @xmath21 is the uv absorption cross - section per carbon atom for a c@xmath1 molecule , and @xmath22 is the number of carbon atoms in the observed source which are contained within c@xmath1 molecules .",
    "the uv absorption cross - section of the c@xmath1 cation is not directly known from laboratory experiments .",
    "we therefore use the value measured from experiments on neutral pahs , normalized to one carbon atom , as it seems to be similar for graphite and pahs and thus characteristic of sp@xmath23 hybridized carbon ( joblin et al .",
    "1992 , verstraete & lger 1992 ) .",
    "we note that the absorption cross - section for an ionized species is expected to be larger than for a neutral one , especially in the visible ( leach 1987 ) .",
    "our assumption thus probably underestimates the actual absorption , which is suitable for determining an upper limit of the species abundance .",
    "the emitted spectral energy distribution , @xmath24 , depends on the infrared absorption cross - section as a function of wavelength , and the details of how the molecule cools after absorption of a visible or uv photon , as described by lger et al .",
    "we define @xmath25 , the fraction of the total c@xmath26 emitted energy which is emitted in the c@xmath26 bands at 7.11 and 7.51 @xmath0 m , as @xmath27 where the frequency limits @xmath28 and @xmath29 indicate an integration just over the 7.11 and 7.51 @xmath0 m bands .",
    "the total c@xmath26 emitted energy will include emission in the c@xmath26 bands at 7.11 and 7.51 @xmath0 m , emission in the c@xmath26 long - wavelength modes ( approximated by the c@xmath2 modes at 17.3 and 18.9 @xmath0 m ) , and possibly also some unknown amount of fluorescence .",
    "such fluorescence is observed in some neutral aromatic species ( negri & zgierski 1994 ) .",
    "the c@xmath1 fluorescence quantum yield is not known , and so we assume it is negligible . including",
    "a finite amount of c@xmath1 fluorescence would have the effect of increasing our upper limit on the c@xmath1 abundance .",

    "14 @xmath0 m , particularly in wavelength regimes where pahs do not have vibrational transitions .",
    "our case b upper limit on the c@xmath1 abundance is set simply by the total observed flux at 7.11 @xmath0 m in ngc 7023 . if there are additional aromatic molecules which contribute to the observed flux at 7.11 @xmath0 m , as seems likely , then our upper limit to the c@xmath1 abundance of @xmath30.26% of interstellar carbon is an overestimate .",
    "we also searched for the neutral c@xmath2 features near 7.0  7.1 and 8.45  8.6 @xmath0 m ( krtschmer et al .",
    "1990 , nemes et al .",
    "we found no resolved emission features at the expected wavelengths .",
    "we estimate an upper limit on the neutral c@xmath2 abundance using the case b method , by assuming that all of the the observed flux in ngc 7023 at 7.0 @xmath0 m is due to c@xmath2 .",
    "we require that the ratio of the integrated cross - section of the 8.45 @xmath0 m band to the integrated cross - section of the 7.0 @xmath0 m band matches the experimental ratio of 0.75 , and we assumed that the features were gaussians with a width of 0.05 @xmath0 m .",
    "we find an upper limit on @xmath53 ( case b ) of @xmath32.0 @xmath10 10@xmath50 w m@xmath54 .",
    "we follow the same procedure for c@xmath2 as for c@xmath1 , as our calculation did not make any corrections for the ionization state of the fullerene .",
    "this implies a case b upper limit for the abundance of the neutral c@xmath2 molecule of of @xmath30.27% of interstellar carbon .",
    "ionization models predict that the neutral c@xmath2 abundance should be @xmath120.7 times the c@xmath1 abundance in the highly illuminated environment of a b star ( bakes and tielens 1995 ) .",
    "our case b upper limits on the abundances of c@xmath2 and c@xmath1 , respectively @xmath30.27% and @xmath30.26% of interstellar carbon , do not contradict the predictions of ionization models , as we do not detect either molecule in ngc 7023 .",
    "we have searched for the vibrational emission bands of c@xmath1 , at 7.11 and 7.51 @xmath0 m , and of c@xmath2 , at 7.0 and 8.45 @xmath0 m , using a new iso spectrum of the reflection nebula ngc 7023 .",
    "we do not detect emission from either fullerene molecule , and we place upper limits on their abundances .",
    "our upper limit on the c@xmath1 abundance , from the lack of observed vibrational emission , is independent of other estimates based on assigning diffuse interstellar bands at 9577 and 9632    to electronic absorption bands of c@xmath1 ( jenniskens et al .",
    "1997 , foing & ehrenfreund 1994 , 1997 ) .",
    "if we assume that all of the flux observed toward ngc 7023 at 7.11 @xmath0 m is due to c@xmath1 , then we derive an upper limit on the c@xmath1 abundance of @xmath30.26% of interstellar carbon toward ngc 7023 .",
    "this upper limit is just compatible with the jenniskens et al .",
    "( 1997 ) observations , which imply 0.25 to 0.52% of interstellar carbon is in c@xmath1 , and is significantly below the c@xmath1 abundance inferred from foing & ehrenfreund ( 1994 , 1997 ) . if we instead assume that c@xmath1 would produce only a small bump on a local continuum due to the blue wing of the 7.7 @xmath0 m interstellar emission feature , then our upper limit on the c@xmath1 abundance , @xmath30.027% of interstellar carbon , is a factor of ten less than the estimates from the 9577 and 9632   dibs .",
    "the apparent lack of c@xmath1 toward ngc 7023 is unlikely to be due to the ionization state of the fullerene .",
    "our upper limit on c@xmath2 , @xmath30.27% of interstellar carbon , is comparable to our upper limit on c@xmath1 .",
    "ionization models of aromatic hydrocarbons predict that the fraction of c@xmath7 is negligible in ngc 7023 ( bakes & tielens 1995 ) .",
    "these models also predict that the c@xmath1 fraction should be higher in ngc 7023 than in the diffuse medium where foing & ehrenfreund ( 1994 , 1997 ) and jenniskens et al .",
    "( 1997 ) made their observations .",
    "there are several possible explanations for why c@xmath1 is not detected toward ngc 7023 in the amount inferred from the near - ir dib observations .",
    "it is possible that we have overestimated the fraction of energy absorbed by c@xmath1 which is re - radiated near 7 @xmath0 m , for instance if the c@xmath1 far - infrared modes are stronger than expected from data on c@xmath2 , or if fluorescence is non - negligible . also , while the 9577 and 9632   dibs have not yet been observed toward the central star in ngc 7023 , other dibs",
    "are observed to be anomalously weak toward this star ( snow et al .",
    "1995 ; oudmaijer et al .",
    "jenniskens et al .",
    "( 1997 ) observe that the 9577 and 9632   dibs follow the behavior of other dibs ( jenniskens et al .",
    "1994 ) in being significantly fainter in dense molecular clouds with strong uv irradiation .",
    "a third explanation is that the 9577 and 9632   dibs are not due to c@xmath1 , as argued by maier ( 1994 ) and jenniskens et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "new laboratory data will be critical to answering some of these questions .",
    "it is essential to obtain the near - ir gas - phase spectrum ( 0.94 to 1.0 @xmath0 m ) of c@xmath1 , in order to confirm or deny the assignment of the 9577/9632   dibs to c@xmath1 .",
    "it is important to measure the broadening and wavelength shift induced by temperature effects on the vibrational bands of c@xmath1 , which we can only estimate from laboratory measurements on similar molecules",
    ". it would also be useful to observe the full - range ir absorption spectrum of c@xmath1 to measure the relative cross - sections of all four vibrational bands .",
    "we conclude that c@xmath2 related species do not appear to be a dominant form of carbonaceous species in the interstellar medium .",
    "confirmation of this result , as well as further searches for fullerene or fullerane species in interstellar spectra , should be pursued at various wavelengths .",
    "additional searches for the fullerene bands near 7 @xmath0 m in circumstellar environments , where c@xmath2 and related molecules could be formed , could be particularly fruitful .",
