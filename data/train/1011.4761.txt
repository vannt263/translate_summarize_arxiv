    "composite quantum systems may possess correlations of a different nature with respect to classical ones .",
    "for the latter , correlations are generally measured by the mutual information , whose extension to the quantum realm , however , leads to two different quantities : the quantum mutual information @xmath0 and the classical correlations @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the quantum discord is the difference between these two quantities , i.e. , @xmath2 .",
    "this quantity is zero only for classically correlated states , i.e. , in the case of bipartite systems , for states of the form @xmath3 , with @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 being orthogonal states of the two subsystems . in this sense",
    "the quantum discord measures quantum correlations .    for mixed quantum states , the discord does not coincide with entanglement . indeed",
    ", there exist separable states having non - zero discord @xcite .",
    "recently , the properties of quantum and classical correlations have received a huge deal of attention in both applicative and fundamental research @xcite . in particular , it has been demonstrated that states having nonzero discord but zero entanglement can be used in certain models of quantum computation to achieve significant speedup with respect to the classical algorithms @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that , under certain conditions , quantum discord is totally unaffected by non - dissipative noise for long time intervals @xcite .    in this article",
    "we study the effect of nonselective projective measurements on the dynamics of a simple bipartite quantum system .",
    "our aim is to investigate how both quantum and classical correlations are affected by the measurements .",
    "we focus , in particular , on a system of two noninteracting qubits immersed in a common structured reservoir , such as the principal mode of a high - q cavity .",
    "it is known that , in this case , certain types of measurements performed on either the collective state of the system or the state of the cavity , may inhibit the loss of quantum entanglement initially present in the two qubits states @xcite .",
    "the resulting measurement - induced protection of entanglement was studied in the case in which the two qubits are resonantly coupled with the cavity mode .",
    "we now extend the results we have presented in a previous letter @xcite in two directions .",
    "first of all we consider different cases of off - resonant interaction between the qubits and the cavity mode and we show that , under certain conditions , the same measurements that allowed to significantly suppress entanglement loss are now responsible for a much faster disentanglement , as a result of the anti - zeno effect @xcite . secondly , we study how measurements affect not only entanglement but also other types of correlations between the qubits , namely classical correlations and quantum discord .",
    "we show that , contrarily to what has been found in previously studied systems @xcite , the dynamics of classical and quantum correlations , in the system here considered , is qualitatively very similar to the dynamics of entanglement .",
    "therefore , projective measurements have a very similar effect on these three types of correlations .",
    "in particular , we show that there exist working conditions for which a series of oscillations occurs between the zeno and anti - zeno regimes , both for the quantum and the classical correlations , and that the amount of correlations can depend on the relative phase of the initial state . oscillations between zeno and anti - zeno regimes have also been predicted in the quantum brownian motion model for certain types of structured environments @xcite .",

    "we have investigated this behavior in details , and showed a sensitivity of the coarse grained dynamics effectively induced by the measurements to the relative phase of the initial state .",
