    "the investigations on zno material have been continued for many decades due to its wide range of applications @xcite . due to its large direct band gap ( @xmath0 3.3 ev at 300 k ) and large exciton binding energy @xmath1 60 mev ( room - temperature 300 k is about @xmath1 25 mev )",
    ", it is an important material for manufacturing ultraviolet devices @xcite and high temperature luminescent devices @xcite .",
    "its easy growth with high purity makes it a low cost material as high quality substrate @xcite and its easily etched property makes it possible to be made as small - size devices .",
    "it can be used as space devices @xcite and transparent thin - film transistors @xcite because of its insensitivity to high energy radiation and visible light .",
    "it can also be a candidate as a spintronic material because mn - doped zno , as well as fe- , co- , or ni - alloyed zno , has high curie temperature ferromagnetism @xcite .",
    "there are many other properties and applications for zno bulk material and zno related materials that make zno a unique material for emerging nano - technology @xcite .",
    "recently , several configurations of zno nanostructures such as nanowires @xcite , nanotubes @xcite , nanobelts @xcite , nanosheets @xcite and nanorods @xcite , have attracted much attention due to their potential applications and easy fabrication @xcite .",
    "such zno nanostructures have novel electrical @xcite and optoelectrical @xcite properties as well as mechanical properties @xcite .",
    "they can be used to make sensitive chemical nanosensors @xcite , solar cell @xcite , light - emitting devices @xcite , nanogenerators ( converting nano - scale mechanical energy into electricity ) and nano - piezotronic devices @xcite .",
    "first principles calculations for the geometry and electronic structure of small zno nanowire and nanobelt were also carried out by many authors @xcite .",
    "more recently , the carrier transport of zno coupled by metal layers such as au electrode and mg electrode were studied by kamiya @xcite . in their calculation",
    ", it was found that the au - zno - au interface shows schottky contact behavior while the mg - zno - mg interface shows ohmic contact .",
    "the contact behavior has crucial influence on the device property and is very sensitive to the fabrication processes @xcite .",
    "hence it is very useful to study the contact behaviors between zno and other materials .",
    "in addition , it is very useful to study other transport properties such as charge polarization and electrochemical capacitance . in this paper",
    ", we concentrated on the transport behaviors and charge distribution and charge accumulation of al - zno - al molecular structure by the density functional theory combined with nonequilibrium green s function method .",
    "different from au - zno - au and mg - zno - mg nanostructures , we found that for al - zno - al molecular junction the i - v curve is highly asymmetric .",
    "in addition , a negative differential resistance appears at negative bias voltage .",
    "furthermore , we have calculated the electrochemical capacitance @xmath2 of this device and found that @xmath2 depends on bias voltage in a unique way : there exists three regions where @xmath2 is constant . at small bias",
    ", our analysis shows that electrochemical capacitance is dominated by the classical capacitance whereas at large bias voltage quantum effect becomes important .",
    "here we present our first principles analysis of electronic transport through a al - zno - al nano - device .",
    "the calculation package we used is nadcal @xcite ( the developed code of mcdcal @xcite ) , which is an implementation of real space density functional theory ( dft ) within the keldysh non - equilibrium green s function formalism ( negf ) .",
    "the dft method provides the system electronic structure and negf includes information of the non - equilibrium quantum statistics .",
    "the system we studied was a typical two - probe open system which was divided into a scattering region and two semi - infinite electrodes .",
    "the electronic structure of the central region was calculated self - consistently and the couplings between the central region and the two semi - infinite electrodes were included by the self - energy .",
    "enough buffer layers for al atomic electrode were included in the cental region so that the boundary conditions of the scattering region could be determined through the corresponding infinite left and right electrodes .",
    "we refer to references @xcite for detailed description of negf - dft technique .",
    "our central scattering region consisted of 6-layers of ( 0001 ) zno with width 3.752  and three buffer layers of each aluminium electrodes ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "each zno layer had 3 oxygen atoms and 3 zinc atoms .",
    "basis set was composed of s , p , d real space linear combination atomic orbitals ( lcao ) .",
    "@xmath3 was chosen as valence electrons for zinc and @xmath4 for oxygen .",
    "exchange correlation was treated using ldapz @xcite .",
    "when solving the poisson equation in real space one grid point occupied a volume of @xmath5 @xmath6 . in the self - consistent calculation ,",
    "the tolerance was set to be less than @xmath7 hartree .    for al - zno - al structure in figure [ fig1 ] ,",
    "the left electrode was coupled directly to oxygen atoms ( al - o contact ) and the right electrode was coupled to zinc atoms ( al - zn contact ) . instead of relaxing zno and aluminium electrodes , we determined the distances between zno and electrodes by finding the minimum of total energy when changing the distance of al - o and zn - al respectively . according to figure [ fig2 ] we set the distance between aluminum electrode and oxygen side of zno to be 1.95  while the distance of zn - al to be 2.75  .",
    "for the two - probe negf+dft formalism , the electronic current can be obtained by landauer - b@xmath8ttiker formula @xmath9(f_l(e,\\mu_l)-f_r(e,\\mu_r ) ) , \\label{ivcurve}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the transmission matrix and is obtained by green s function from the following formula @xmath11 @xmath12^{-1}$ ] is the fermi distribution function of left / right electron reservoir connected to the left / right electrode at infinite @xmath13 .",

    "[ b ] ; ( b)transmission coefficient versus energy at bias voltage @xmath17 ; ( c ) dos versus energy due to zinc @xmath18 state ( zn : s solid line ) , oxygen @xmath19 state in @xmath20-direction ( o : pz dashed line ) and oxygen @xmath21 state ( o : s dotted line),title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=302 ]    -state on each layer ; ( b ) local density of states of oxygen @xmath22-state on each layer.,width=302,height=245 ]    in figure [ fig3 ] , we plotted the current - voltage ( i - v ) curve of al - zno - al . a rectifying i - v characteristics",
    "is clearly observed .",
    "the current increases slowly with increasing of the positive bias voltage @xmath23 but decreases quickly when the bias voltage reverses its sign .",
    "different behaviors of i - v characteristics when the bias voltage changes from positive to negative can be understood as follows . at zero temperature and in hartree unit , equation ( [ ivcurve ] )",
    "becomes ( we set @xmath24 in our calculation . )",
    "@xmath25    we find that when the positive bias voltage is applied , the current is contributed from the energy integral interval @xmath26 .",
    "but for negative voltage @xmath27 , the transmission coefficient will be integrated on the positive interval @xmath28 .",
    "although the transmission coefficient is a function of the bias voltage , we first analyze the i - v curve near @xmath17 . for this purpose , we plotted the transmission coefficient and the density of states ( dos ) versus the fermi energy at @xmath17 in figure [ fig3 ] . in our calculation",
    "we find that three kinds of states give major contributions to the i - v curve .",
    "they are zinc @xmath18-orbital , oxygen @xmath20-component of @xmath19-orbital and oxygen @xmath21-orbital . among them , contribution due to oxygen @xmath21-orbital is the smallest so we focus on the other two orbits .",
    "it is clear that when @xmath29 the dos of zinc @xmath30-orbital is much larger than that of oxygen @xmath22-orbital and when @xmath31 both zinc @xmath30-orbital and oxygen @xmath22-orbital contribute near @xmath32 but the contribution is less than that of the zinc @xmath30-state at @xmath29 .",
    "so we conclude that when negative bias voltage is added electrons pass device mainly from zinc @xmath30-orbital but when the positive bias voltage is added electrons pass device mainly from both zinc @xmath30-orbital and oxygen @xmath22-orbital . to provide further evidence",
    ", we analyze the local density of states ( ldos ) according to the layers of zno in the scattering region ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "note that we label the layers of oxygen and zinc from left to right .",
    "one can find that each layer has very different ldos",
    ". for zinc atoms , the rightmost layer ( the layer 6 , i.e. the layer coupled directly to aluminium lead ) gives the largest ldos around the fermi level .",
    "( the fermi level is shifted to @xmath32 in our calculation . )",
    "when the energy increases the ldos of middle layers ( layers 2 to 4 ) gradually increase and reach their maxima at about @xmath33 ev .",
    "but the ldos of all zinc layers become small when @xmath34 ev . for oxygen atoms ,",
    "similar result is found if we recall that the first oxygen layer is connected directly to the left aluminium electrode .",
    "the ldos of oxygen give the largest value at the first oxygen layer around the fermi level @xmath32 .",
    "when @xmath35 becomes quite small and closes to @xmath36 ev , the ldos of the middle layers ( layer 3 and layer 4 ) dominate and when @xmath29 the ldos of oxygen are small compared with the those of @xmath31 . in another word ,",
    "when small negative bias voltage is applied the contact interface between al - zn dominates i - v behavior .",
    "but when the positive bias voltage is applied , both al - zn interface and al - o interface will dominate the charge transport .",
    "the rectifying behavior is mainly controlled by the contact interface characteristics due to the different coupling atoms al - zn and al - o when bias voltage is small .",
    "actually the transmission coefficient @xmath37 $ ] is a function of the bias voltage @xmath38 at zero temperature so the situation becomes more complicated at large @xmath23 . in figure [ fig5 ] ,",
    "the transmission coefficient as a function of the energy @xmath35 and the bias voltage @xmath23 was depicted .",
    "the i - v curve for positive bias voltage corresponds to the triangular area a between the vertical line @xmath32 and the slope line @xmath39 for bias voltage @xmath40 and energy @xmath31 ( see the dashed black lines in figure [ fig5 ] ) and the i - v curve for negative bias voltage corresponds to the triangular area b between the above two lines for @xmath27 and @xmath29 .",
    "we find that in the right low triangular area b the transmission coefficient is much large within the interval @xmath41 v and reach maximum around @xmath42 v ( see the c region in figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "that s why the absolute current value decreases when the absolute value of bias voltage increases around @xmath43 v and the negative differential resistance appears in that voltage region ( see i - v curve on the interval @xmath44 v in figure [ fig3](a ) ) .",
    "[ t ]   and energy @xmath35 .",
    "the dashed black lines are only used as symbol lines in order to depict the region a , b and c. , title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=226 ]    for the quantum devices , due to finite density of states the charge accumulation in the scattering region differs from the charge accumulation in the classical metal capacitance and one should use the concept of electrochemical capacitance @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the electrochemical potential difference between the two electron reservoirs @xcite and the @xmath47 is the charge accumulation . for our two - probe problem ,",
    "both electrodes are aluminium so that @xmath48 .",
    "hence , at zero temperature , we have @xmath49 .",
    "when the bias voltage is applied , the electrochemical potential across two probes is changed by @xmath50 from equilibrium , charges will be injected into the scattering region .",
    "the induced charges will occur due to the electron - electron interaction . in dft , the injected and induced charges are automatically considered by solving the kohn - sham equation and the poisson equation self - consistently and the gauge invariant is also satisfied automatically @xcite .",
    "such a charge accumulation is closely related to the i - v characteristics and can only be determined by solving scattering problem . for a rough estimate",
    ", we divide the system into two parts from the middle of scattering region called left region and right region .",
    "we then calculate the charge accumulation @xmath51 and @xmath52 and plot them in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "the electrochemical differential capacitance @xmath53 was also plotted in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "here , @xmath54 is the fitted curve of @xmath55 .",
    "following observations are in order .",
    "first of all , the electrochemical capacitance depends on the voltage although it is a piece - wise constant in three regions labeled as ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "secondly , the asymmetry of electrochemical capacitance @xmath2 is clearly seen . in region ( a ) which is asymmetric with respect to the bias voltage @xmath56 v the electrochemical capacitance assumes a smaller constant value @xmath57 af . while in region ( b ) and ( c ) , @xmath2 are approximately four times larger .",
    "the value of the electrochemical capacitance also exhibits asymmetry between region ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "finally , the behavior of electrochemical capacitance in region ( a ) can be understood _ qualitatively _ as follow . since in region ( a )",
    "the current is small , we can use the following formula for electrochemical capacitance ( where the current is assumed to be zero ) @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the classical capacitance which can be roughly estimated using the parallel plate capacitor @xmath60 af where a is the cross - section area and d is the separation of two plates . here",
    "@xmath61 and @xmath62 are the dos of the left and right regions , respectively . from figure [ fig4 ]",
    ", we see that @xmath61 and @xmath63 are much larger than @xmath64 and hence can be neglected in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that in region ( a ) , the electrochemical capacitance is dominated by the classical capacitance . in region",
    "( b ) and ( c ) , however , quantum effect must be considered .",
    "at the moment , there is no analytic formula to account for the electrochemical capacitance at the nonlinear bias voltage .    : triangles ) and right scattering region ( @xmath65 : squares ) .",
    "the black solid line @xmath66 is the fitted curve of @xmath65 ; ( b ) electrochemical differential capacitance @xmath67 versus bias voltage.,width=302,height=245 ]    in summary , we have analyzed the electron transport through the al - zno - al atomic junction and clear rectifying characteristic was observed .",
    "it was found that the contact interfaces between aluminium electrodes and central device zno play essential roles in the current - voltage behaviors when the bias voltage is small .",
    "when the negative bias voltage is applied , the major contribution to the electron transport comes from zn @xmath30-states .",
    "but when the positive bias voltage is applied , both zn @xmath30-state and o @xmath22-state are responsible in the charge transport .",
