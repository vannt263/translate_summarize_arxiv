    "heavy ion collisions at rhic @xcite and the lhc @xcite produce a medium whose evolution , at least at early times , is well described by hydrodynamics with a very small viscosity @xcite ( at least when normalized to the entropy density @xcite ) .",
    "a major theoretical goal is now to determine this viscosity as accurately as possible , by modeling the development of a heavy ion collision with viscous hydrodynamics . in order to do so",
    "it is necessary to go beyond the `` first - order '' ( navier - stokes ) formalism , because the first - order formalism leads to acausal and unstable evolution in a relativistic setting @xcite .",
    "as shown by israel and stewart @xcite , this problem can be cured by working instead with hydrodynamics expanded to the second order in gradients , which should have the added advantage of being more accurate .",
    "several groups have been involved in studying the hydrodynamics of heavy ion collisions using such second - order formalisms @xcite . however , within the community which studies hydrodynamics and kinetics of atomic gases , it has been known for almost 40 years that the gradient expansion in hydrodynamics fails beyond the first order @xcite . is this also true in the relativistic setting ?",
    "if so , what implications does it have for the study of hydrodynamics via the second - order formalism ?",
    "we start by reviewing relativistic hydrodynamics to second order .",
    "hydrodynamics is the modeling of a fluid by solving the stress - energy conservation equations one also considers current conservation @xmath3 . in equilibrium @xmath4 , out of equilibrium there can be derivative corrections .",
    "however , in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions the density of the conserved baryon number in the central rapidity region is small , so we will neglect it and will not discuss conserved currents further . ]",
    "@xmath5 assuming some functional form for the stress tensor .",
    "ideal hydrodynamics assumes the equilibrium form , @xmath6 where @xmath7 $ ] is the metric , @xmath8 is the 4-velocity determining the rest - frame ( normalized so @xmath9 ) , @xmath10 is the rest - frame energy density , and @xmath11 is the pressure as determined by the equation of state @xmath12 .",
    "viscous hydrodynamics assumes that the fluid is near equilibrium so that @xmath13 is close to this form . assuming that equilibration is a fast , local process , corrections to this form can be written in terms of an expansion in gradients .",
    "israel and stewart showed @xcite that a slight re - organization of the second - order derivative expansion yields stable equations which are correct to second order provided a particular additional term appears at second order ; @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the `` classical '' viscosity coefficient that one would obtain from a microscopic calculation using the kubo formula based on ( [ tgradient ] ) .",
    "the angular brackets in @xmath16 mean that the indices are to be symmetrized , projected to be spatial in the frame given by @xmath8 , and trace - subtracted . which is a projector to local rest - frame spatial components , @xmath17 . ]",
    "the extra terms include bulk viscosity and nonlinear effects , and are catalogued in @xcite .",
    "to simplify the discussion here we will consider a conformal fluid , in which case the bulk viscous term is absent . while this is not a very good approximation for qcd near the transition temperature , in practice the inclusion of bulk viscosity and a realistic equation of state would have only a small influence on our final results .",
    "solving the hydrodynamic equations for small fluctuations in @xmath8 , @xmath18 about constant values , one finds two sorts of long - lived wave solutions , sound waves and shear waves . at lowest order in @xmath19 ,",
    "they obey dispersion relations of @xmath20 each sort of wave decays with time , but with a decay rate which vanishes quadratically in the small @xmath21 limit , as well as becoming small for small @xmath15 .",
    "generically , out of equilibrium such waves will be present with large amplitudes .",
    "but equipartition of energy says that even in equilibrium such waves will be present , carrying energy which averages to @xmath22 per degree of freedom .",
    "the long decay times of these waves contradict the assumption that all degrees of freedom in a fluid equilibrate via rapid local processes .",
    "this imperils the assumption behind the gradient expansion in .",
    "if there are arbitrarily slowly equilibrating degrees of freedom , can contain terms nonanalytic in gradients . in the nonrelativistic",
    "setting it is known that precisely this happens @xcite .    to see more intuitively how hydrodynamic waves can contribute to hydrodynamic coefficients , consider a shear wave , as illustrated in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "hydrodynamics says that this wave configuration will decay with time as the @xmath23-momentum carried by the fluid diffuses in the @xmath24 direction into neighboring regions , which are not flowing .",
    "the rate of this diffusion is controlled by shear viscosity , which is by definition the diffusion coefficient for the component of momentum transverse to the diffusion ( the @xmath24-diffusion of @xmath23-momentum in this illustration ) .",
    "but one of the mechanisms which can transmit @xmath23-momentum is hydrodynamic waves , such as sound waves , with wave lengths shorter than the hydrodynamic structure considered .",
    "sound waves leaving the @xmath23-moving fluid carry net @xmath23-momentum away , diffusing away this component of momentum .",
    "the phase space of such waves scales as @xmath25 which is very uv dominated ; but the distance propagated before dissipation scales as @xmath26 as we just saw , leading to a contribution to viscosity which scales as @xmath27 .",
    "this is ir finite , though it would not be in 2 spatial dimensions @xcite .",
    "the contribution is larger for smaller @xmath15 , both because hydrodynamic waves propagate further and because the range of @xmath21 where hydro is valid expands at smaller @xmath15 , so the phase space of hydrodynamic waves is larger .",
    "similarly , @xmath0 can be interpreted as a relaxation time ; if a fluid suddenly develops shear flow , @xmath0 is the time scale for momentum diffusion to be established .",
    "we already saw that hydrodynamic modes contribute to momentum diffusion , with a mode of wave number @xmath21 contributing of order @xmath26 .",
    "the time scale for this mode to leave equilibrium and establish its contribution to momentum diffusion also scales as @xmath26 .",
    "this suggests that such a mode contributes to @xmath0 by an amount proportional to @xmath28 , leading to an @xmath29 contribution to @xmath0 , which is small @xmath21 divergent .",
    "ref .  @xcite derives the following kubo relation for the shear viscosity @xmath15 and the relaxation time @xmath0 in terms of the retarded correlation function for two @xmath30 stress - tensor operators : @xmath31 here @xmath32 is another transport coefficient discussed in @xcite .",
    "we see from the above that @xmath32 can be extracted from the zero frequency behavior of the stress - stress correlation function , @xmath33 .",
    "the zero frequency retarded function equals the euclidean correlation function , so @xmath32 is a thermodynamic property @xcite , which is not sensitive to long - wavelength hydrodynamic waves .",
    "since we are not interested in the value of @xmath32 , we will consider @xmath34 at vanishing external spatial momentum @xmath35 and small nonzero frequency @xmath36 .    to compute the contribution of hydrodynamic waves to @xmath37 and @xmath0",
    ", we compute their contribution to the above correlation function , along the lines of what kovtun and yaffe did for the symmetrized correlator @xcite .",
    "the operator @xmath30 to be used in the green function above is the hydrodynamic one as described in and above , allowing for thermally occupied fluctuations in @xmath8 and @xmath18 . in the absence of fluctuations @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the equilibrium energy density .",

    "the expression above is automatically @xmath48 and so it does not contribute in the @xmath49 limit .",
    "but there can also be local contributions , that is , contributions proportional to @xmath50 or its derivatives , arising from the overlap of @xmath51 operators [ contact terms ] .",
    "we will present a direct calculation of such contact terms within hydrodynamic theory in a future publication @xcite . for our current purposes",
    "we will instead extract them by using stress conservation , @xmath52 together with the known expression for @xmath53 ( see eq.(33d ) of @xcite ) : @xmath54 the first term in ( [ g_1order ] ) is the contact term , which gives rise to the @xmath55 term in .",
    "the second term is the contribution from the correlator of the @xmath56 part of @xmath30 , which vanishes at small @xmath21 .",
    "now we extend this calculation to second order in fluctuations . at this order",
    "there are higher order corrections to the terms involving a single power of @xmath57 in @xmath30 ; and the lowest order contribution from terms involving two powers of @xmath58 in @xmath30 .",
    "but since the terms involving a single power of @xmath57 in @xmath30 always involve spatial derivatives , these terms all vanish in the @xmath59 limit , like the second term in above .",
    "so we skip their calculation and concentrate on contributions from second - order in fluctuation terms in @xmath30 .",
    "there are several such terms in but we will concentrate on the term @xmath60 , and explain why the other terms can be neglected at the end . since @xmath61 is already quadratic in fluctuations , we can neglect fluctuations in @xmath18 and replace @xmath62 with @xmath63 .",

    "the two `` interesting '' terms are @xmath90 comparing with , we see that the first term is a positive contribution to the shear viscosity arising from shear waves .",
    "the imaginary part of the second term is a frequency dependent reduction in the shear viscosity , which vanishes as @xmath91 .",
    "therefore there is no problem defining the shear viscosity in terms of the zero frequency limit of @xmath92 .",
    "the real part of the @xmath93 term has the same sign as the @xmath0 term in , but the wrong @xmath36 dependence .",
    "this term can be interpreted as a frequency dependent correction to @xmath0 which diverges at small frequency ; or it can be interpreted as a breakdown of the validity of the hydrodynamic expansion beyond one - derivative order .",
    "we should also include the sound ( @xmath94 ) terms in @xmath75 shown in and .",
    "if we assume @xmath95 then the sound part in ( [ deltar ] ) may be approximated as @xmath96 which has the advantage that now the @xmath97 poles in ( [ gxyxy_r ] ) are simple .",
    "the integration is then straightforward and for the mixed shear - sound term one has @xmath98",
    "one thus finds that the mixed shear - sound term is suppressed with respect to the result ( [ midgxyxyresult ] ) by extra powers of @xmath99 . the sound - sound term contains a part that has the same structure as the shear - shear contribution , as well as other parts that are again suppressed by powers of @xmath99 .",
    "evaluation of the `` interesting '' contribution to leading order in @xmath99 gives @xmath100 this is our main result .",
    "let us finally comment about whether or not we need to consider other contributions to @xmath85 coming , for instance , from the @xmath101 term in . since hydrodynamics is predicated on the convergence of the derivative expansion introduced in eqs .",
    "( [ teq],[tgradient ] ) , @xmath86 should be chosen as the largest momentum scale where successive terms in the series are successively smaller , which requires @xmath102 ( comparing the zero and one - derivative terms ) , @xmath103 ( comparing the one - derivative and two - derivative terms ) .",
    "this also ensures that hydrodynamic waves with @xmath104 will have @xmath105 , so that hydrodynamic waves are well - defined , long - lived excitations in the plasma . and",
    "it ensures that the real parts of the propagating frequencies of the two sound waves and the shear wave are more widely separated than their imaginary parts .",
    "these conditions ensure that contributions to @xmath85 from higher - derivative terms in , and contributions arising from interference between sound and shear waves in , are small compared to the terms we have computed . in particular , terms arising from @xmath106 in will give rise to an integrand similar to but with an extra power of @xmath107 .",
    "the resulting term will be analytic in the frequency and will give corrections suppressed by @xmath108 relative to the terms we have computed .",
    "we will not attempt to compute such suppressed corrections here .",
    "we found that , besides the `` classical '' viscosity @xmath15 , there is an additional contribution to viscosity as measured on very long distance and time scales , generated by relatively short - wavelength hydrodynamic waves .",
    "it is given by the coefficient of @xmath109 in : @xmath110 where higher power corrections in @xmath86 can be neglected as long as @xmath111 . the new contribution from scales as an inverse power of @xmath15 .",
    "therefore @xmath112 has a positive minimum at a nonzero value of @xmath15 .",
    "this places a lower bound on the total ( infrared ) value of @xmath37 in any given theory .    to estimate the size of the new term and the minimum possible viscosity , we need to estimate @xmath86 .",
    "as discussed , @xmath86 should the the largest wave number such that the gradient expansion converges and a hydrodynamic description is self - consistent .",
    "following the discussion after , we will estimate @xmath113 , or @xmath114 .",
    "the total viscosity @xmath37 is then the classical plus the new contribution , @xmath115 which leads to the an absolute lower bound on the total viscosity : @xmath116    in a theory with many colors and a weak coupling so that parametrically @xcite @xmath117 the new contribution is parametrically @xmath118 showing that the new contribution is safely subdominant in any theory which is either weakly coupled or has many fields .",
    "however , in the real world qcd has 3 colors and the coupling at scales of current interest is not small .",
    "how large is this new contribution to @xmath37 in this case ? to address this , we need estimates for @xmath15 , @xmath0 , and @xmath119 for real - world qcd . the easiest is @xmath120 , which can be determined on the lattice .",
    "according to borsnyi _",
    "et al _ @xcite fig .",
    "12 , between @xmath121mev and @xmath122mev @xmath123 rises from about 10 to about 14 .",
    "et al _ @xcite fig .",
    "8 gives comparable numbers , with @xmath123 rising from 11 to 16 in the same range .",
    "@xmath0 naturally scales as @xmath124 , and estimates in qcd vary from @xmath125 , the value in strongly coupled @xmath126 sym @xcite , to@xmath127 , the value in weakly coupled qcd @xcite .",
    "the trend is that , while @xmath128 is a pure number of order unity , it is smaller in more strongly - coupled contexts and larger in weakly - coupled contexts . so in the context of qcd with a small shear viscosity it probably makes sense to assume @xmath129 is at the low end of this estimated range .",
    "regarding @xmath15 , the lowest estimates for @xmath130 are around @xmath131 , while @xmath132 may be on the high side in terms of fitting elliptic flow data @xcite .    if we estimate that @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 , we find @xmath136 and @xmath137",
    ". the true value of @xmath138 would then be @xmath139 .",
    "varying the value of @xmath130 while holding the other estimates fixed , this is close to the minimum value of the _ total _ viscosity . on the other hand , if @xmath140 but the other estimates are the same , then @xmath141 and @xmath142 , which is a negligible correction to the total viscosity .",
    "therefore the importance of the `` new '' contribution to viscosity is quite sensitive to the value of @xmath130 ; for real - world values of other parameters @xmath143 appears to be impossible , but @xmath144 is not .",
    "the presence of a nonanalytic term in the frequency expansion for @xmath145 implies that hydrodynamics at second order in gradients does not , strictly speaking , work .",
    "however , in practice we are usually interested in applying hydrodynamics over some range of time , with some limited time resolution , and with a finite accuracy tolerance",
    ". if the nonanalytic term is sufficiently small compared to the @xmath146 term for the frequency scales which are of actual importance in a particular problem , then there may be no issue in practice with using second order hydrodynamics . to see whether this is the case , we should estimate the frequency @xmath147 where the @xmath148 term is larger than the @xmath149 term .",
    "clearly , for @xmath150 , the second - order treatment becomes invalid .    again using the parametric estimates of",
    ", the frequency expansion of @xmath85 , plus , is parametrically of form @xmath151 the frequency scale where the @xmath148 term first dominates the @xmath146 term is parametrically @xmath152 therefore , in a theory which _ either _ has a large number of colors _ or _ has weak coupling , the frequency scale where the new term becomes important is parametrically tiny . then there is no obstacle to using second - order hydrodynamics for @xmath153",
    "; the second - order treatment will only become invalid at a frequency scale where it is in any case almost irrelevant compared to the @xmath154 viscous term .",
    "now we turn to real - world qcd . to determine the breakdown scale of second - order hydrodynamics we again compute the scale where the real part of the @xmath148 term in equals the @xmath149 term in : @xmath155    .[table : taupi ] frequency scale @xmath147 where the @xmath148 term equals the @xmath149 term in @xmath156 . for @xmath150 ,",
    "second - order hydrodynamics is inconsistent .

    "below this frequency second - order hydrodynamics is certainly not consistent .",
    "what we see is that , for reasonable values of @xmath123 and of @xmath0 , this frequency scale is very low if @xmath132 , but it is very high for @xmath157 .",
    "therefore , second - order hydrodynamics can be applied to qcd if @xmath158 above the transition temperature ; it breaks down below frequency scales of order @xmath159 , which corresponds to time scales above 20 fermi , safely above the microphysical scale it is intended to model in heavy - ion collisions ( 5 - 10 fm ) .",
    "but if @xmath160 , there is a problem .",
    "second - order hydrodynamics is then already inconsistent on frequency scales of order @xmath161 , corresponding to time scales above 0.4 fermi .",
    "this is a shorter time scale than our estimate @xmath162 for the shortest scale on which hydrodynamics is to be reliable .",
    "so in this case there would be _ no _ range of scales on which second - order hydrodynamics is applicable .",
    "let us accentuate the conclusions drawn in the previous subsection by again considering the correction to the viscosity in ( [ mainresult ] ) . as discussed above , eq .",
    "( [ mainresult ] ) contains a constant , @xmath86 dependent correction to the viscosity , but its actual value depends on the estimate for @xmath86 .    a different way to bound what values of viscosity are compatible with second - order hydrodynamics can be obtained by considering the imaginary part for the @xmath93 term , which can be interpreted as a frequency - dependent correction to the viscosity , @xmath163 note that the first and second term become of the same order at @xmath164 , where @xmath165 second - order hydrodynamics is certainly no longer applicable at @xmath166 , because the frequency dependent contribution to the viscosity becomes large . on the other hand",
    ", we found above that second - order hydrodynamics also breaks down for @xmath167 , because there the frequency dependent contribution to the relaxation time becomes dominant .",

    "but if @xmath160 , then there is _ no _ range of scales where the application of second - order hydrodynamics is consistent in real - world qcd .",
    "while our calculation focussed on the case of relativistic hydrodynamics , a similar calculation should be possible in the non - relativistic setting , presumably with qualitatively similar results .",
    "we leave this interesting project for future work",
    ".    the effects we describe should not be present in dissipative hydrodynamic simulations of heavy ion collisions as they are currently conducted .",
    "that is because , currently , such simulations include dissipative viscous effects , but they do not include the fluctuations required by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem to ensure that hydrodynamic modes equilibrate with mean thermal excitation amplitudes .",
    "so the short - wavelength hydrodynamic waves responsible for the effects we are discussing get quenched in existing hydrodynamic simulations",
    ". it would be very interesting to try to include thermal fluctuations in hydrodynamic variables consistently in hydrodynamic studies of heavy ion collisions .",
    "we would like to thank derek teaney for useful conversations , and the organizers of the 2010 esi workshop ads holography and the quark - gluon plasma in vienna for providing such a nice and stimulating environment that led to the initial conversations triggering this paper .",
