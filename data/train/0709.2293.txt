    "as most of the major natural satellites of the solar system planets , titan is locked in a spin - orbit synchronous resonance , i.e. its rotation period is very near to its orbital period around its parent planet saturn ( see for instance richardson et al .",
    "2004 @xcite ) .",
    "this corresponds to an equilibrium state known as a cassini state .",
    "thanks to the cassini fly - bys , titan s gravity field is known well enough to study the behaviour of titan s spin around the cassini state . in particular , we now know titan s oblateness coefficients @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( tortora et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    in a recent paper , noyelles et al .",
    "( @xcite , hereafter cited as paper i ) give a first theory of titan s rotation , with 3 degrees of freedom . in that work , an analytical approach and a numerical one , more complete ,",
    "are compared .",
    "moreover , some aspects of titan s rotation are elucidated , especially a likely resonance involving the free libration of titan s wobble .    in this paper ,",
    "i first propose an improvement of the analytical model resulting in better agreement with the numerical results .",
    "then i study the dynamics of the likely resonance , and discuss its implications .",
    "i firstly recall how to obtain the hamiltonian of the problem , as explained for instance in paper i. 3 references frames are considered : the first one @xmath15 is centered on titan s mass barycenter and is in translation with the reference frame in which the orbital motion of titan is described .",
    "this is a cartesian coordinate system refering to the equatorial plane of saturn and to the node of this plane with the ecliptic at j2000 .",
    "the second frame @xmath16 is linked to titan s angular momentum @xmath17 , and the third one @xmath18 is rigidly linked to titan .",
    "the first variables that are being used are andoyer s variables ( see andoyer 1926 @xcite and deprit 1967 @xcite ) , which are based on two linked sets of euler s angles .",
    "the first set @xmath19 locates the position of the angular momentum in the first frame @xmath20 , while the second one @xmath21 locates the body frame @xmath18 in the second frame @xmath16 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : angles ] ) .",
    "the canonical set of andoyer s variables consists of the three angular variables @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and their conjugated momenta defined by the norm @xmath25 of the angular momentum and two of its projections :    @xmath26 +    unfortunately , these variables present two singularities : when @xmath27 ( i.e. the angular momentum is colinear to @xmath28 , there is no wobble ) , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are undefined , and when @xmath29 ( i.e. when titan s principal axis of inertia is perpendicular to its orbital plane ) , @xmath24 and @xmath23 are undefined .",
    "that is why we use the modified andoyer s variables :    @xmath30    with @xmath31 .",
    "paper i details how to obtain the hamiltonian of the problem in the modified andoyer s variables .",
    "it takes account of the free rotation of the body , and of the external torque due to saturn ( see eq.[equ : hamiltonclass ] ) .",
    "@xmath32\\big[\\frac{\\gamma_1+\\gamma_2 } { 1-\\gamma_1-\\gamma_2}\\xi_q^2+\\frac{\\gamma_1-\\gamma_2}{1-\\gamma_1+\\gamma_2}\\eta_q^2\\big ] \\\\ + n\\big(\\frac{d_0}{d}\\big)^3\\bigg(1+\\delta_s\\big(\\frac{d_0}{d}\\big)^2\\bigg)\\big[\\delta_1(x^2+y^2)+\\delta_2(x^2-y^2)\\big ] \\end{split}\\ ] ]    the coefficients of the hamiltonian are defined as follows :    @xmath33 +    where @xmath34 is saturn s @xmath13 , @xmath35 the distance titan - saturn , @xmath36 the mean value of @xmath35 , @xmath37 the mean motion associated with @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 are the first two coordinates of saturn in the reference frame @xmath18 bound to titan .",
    "if we call @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 the coordinates of saturn s centre of mass in the reference frame @xmath20 defined above , we have    @xmath43    with    @xmath44    and    @xmath45    at the exact cassini state , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 being respectively titan s mean longitude and ascending node in the frame @xmath20 . in paper",
    "i , henrard & schwanen s model ( i.e. , titan moving on a circular orbit with a constant inclination and a constant precession of the nodes ) has been used to obtain the `` obliquity '' at the equilibrium @xmath52 and the three fundamental periods of the free librations around the cassini state .",
    "then a numerical integration has been performed over 9000 years with complete ephemeris for titan ( tass1.6 , vienne & duriez 1995 @xcite )    .comparison between the analytical and numerical results with @xmath53 , adapted from paper i. the differences are given here relative to the numerical values , but relative to the analytical ones in paper i. [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : comprambh ]    tab.[tab : comprambh ] gives a comparison with previous studies for io and europa .",
    "we can see a good agreement , except perhaps with the `` obliquity '' of io .",
    "i think that the difference of about @xmath54 can be explained by the fact that lainey s ephemeris have been updated between henrard s study and this paper .",
    "in particular , henrard used @xmath55 rad as given in lainey s phd thesis ( 2002 @xcite ) , which is about @xmath56 higher than the value used in this study .",
    "these data have been computed assuming that the satellites are in hydrostatic equilibrium , especially for the values of @xmath57 .",
    "since the values of the periods of libration depend on @xmath57 , observing these librations should help estimate this parameter and test the hypothesis of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "unfortunately , the free librations should have been damped by dissipative effects , unless the amplitude associated is being forced by a resonance ( as could be the case for titan ) .",
    "but no resonance appears clearly in tab.[tab : frekgalrhea ] ( perhaps except between ganymede s wobble @xmath58 and the node of europa , with a regression period of 30.22 years ) .",
    "the general analytical model given in this paper permits a first 3-dimensional description of the rotation of every synchronous body .",
    "more particularly , it gives the equilibrium position , the three fundamental frequencies of the free librations , and the main terms of the free solution .",
    "it is applied successfully to titan , io and europa , in the sense that the results are consistent with the previous studies .",
    "moreover , this paper presents a study of a possible resonance involving titan s wobble . with it ,",
    "i show that if the capture into resonance occured , then the wobble could currently have a forced amplitude of several degrees , and so induce a significant internal tidal dissipation .",
    "moreover , the forcing of the wobble could falsify the space - based detection of titan s period of rotation to appear a little faster than it actually is , in particular because titan s rotation axis would be significantly different from its pole axis of figure .",
    "cassini results on titan s rotation should give some information about that .",
    "even if the system is not in resonance , a quasi - resonant state may have a detectable effect on the free libration w.    i am indebted to several colleagues for fruitful discussions , especially nicolas rambaux , anne lematre , jacques henrard , alain vienne and michael efroimsky .",
    "i also warmly thank the two referees , a. dobrovolskis and an anonymous one , who pointed out a mistake in a previous version of this paper .",
    "this work benefited from the financial support of a fundp postdoctoral research grant .",
    "i here detail the hamiltonian given by ( eq.[eq : t2 ] ) , i.e.                                                                    seidelmann p.k . ,",
