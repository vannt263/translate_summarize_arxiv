    "[ gzk ] shows @xmath18 and @xmath19 for a range of three orders of magnitude and for five different @xmath11 .",
    "the arrival directions of the uhecrs measured by experiments show some peculiar clustering : some events are grouped within @xmath20 , the typical angular resolution of an experiment . above @xmath21 ev 92 cosmic ray events were detected , including 7 doublets and 2 triplets . above @xmath22 ev one doublet out of 14 events",
    "were found @xcite .",
    "the chance probability of such a clustering from uniform distribution is rather small @xcite .",
    "the clustered features of the events initiated an interesting statistical analysis assuming compact uhecr sources @xcite .",
    "the authors found a large number , @xmath23 for the number of sources within the gzk sphere .",
    "we generalize their analysis .",
    "the most probable value for the source density is really large ; however , the statistical significance of this result is rather weak .",
    "[ ell ] shows the cl regions for one of our models ( injected energy distribution @xmath24 ; schechter s luminosity distribution : @xmath25 ) .",
    "the regions are deformed , thin ellipse - like objects . for this model",
    "our final answer for the density is @xmath26  mpc@xmath27 , where the first errors indicate the 68% , the second ones in the parenthesis the 95% cls , respectively .",
    "the choice of @xcite h(j)@xmath28(j) and , e.g. @xmath29 energy distribution gives much smaller value : @xmath30  mpc@xmath27 , which is in a quite good agreement with their result .",
    "an interesting idea discussed by refs.@xcite is that sps could be the source of uhecrs . the hadronic decay of sps yields protons .",
    "they are characterized by the fragmentation function ( ff ) @xmath31 which gives the number of produced protons with momentum fraction @xmath32 at energy scale @xmath33 . for the proton s ff at present accelerator energies we use ref .",
    "we evolve the ffs in ordinary and in supersymmetric qcd to the energies of the sps .",
    "this result can be combined with the prediction of the mlla technique , which gives the initial spectrum of uhecrs at the energy @xmath13 ( cf .",
    "fig .. [ fragmentation ] ) .",
    "similar results are obtained by @xcite .",
    "depending on the location of the source halo or extragalactic ( eg) and the model sm or mssm we study four different scenarios . in",
    "the eg case protons loose some fraction of their energies , described by @xmath8 .",
    "we compare the predicted and the observed spectrums by a maximum likelihood analysis .",
    "this analysis gives the mass of the sp and the error on it .",
    "[ spect ] shows the measured uhecr spectrum and the best fit , which is obtained in the eg - mssm scenario .",
    "the goodnesses of the fits for the halo models are far worse .",
    "the sm and mssm cases do not differ significantly .",
    "the most important message is that the masses of the best fits ( eg cases ) are compatible within the error bars with the mssm gauge coupling unification gut scale : @xmath1  gev , where @xmath2 .",
    "already in the early 80 s there were discussions that the uhe@xmath14 spectrum could have absorption dips at energies around @xmath34=@xmath35=@xmath36 ( 1 ev/@xmath37 ) ev due to resonant annihilation with r@xmath14s of mass @xmath38 , predicted by the hot big bang , into z bosons of mass @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "recently it was realized that the same annihilation mechanism gives a possible solution to the gzk problem  @xcite .",
    "it was argued that the uhecrs above the gzk cutoff are from these z - bursts .",
    "the density distribution of r@xmath14s as hot dm follows the total mass distribution ; however , it is less clustered .",
    "thus we , as opposed to practically all previous authors  @xcite , do not follow the unnatural assumption of having a relative overdensity of @xmath40 in our neighborhood ( for an approach with lepton asymmetry see @xcite ) .        finally , we compare the predicted and observed spectrum and extract the mass of the r@xmath14 and the necessary uhe@xmath14 flux by a maximum likelihood analysis . in the z - burst scenario",
    "small r@xmath14 mass needs large @xmath42 to produce a z. large @xmath42 results in a large lorentz boost , thus large proton energy . in this way",
    "the detected energy determines the mass of the r@xmath14 .",
    "the analysis is completely analogous to that of the previous section .",
    "our best fits to the observed data gives for the neutrino mass @xmath43  ev for the `` halo''- and @xmath44  ev for the `` eg''-case , respectively ( in the halo / eg cases the power part of the uhecr spectrum is generated in the halo / eg ) .",
    "this gives an absolute lower bound on the mass of the heaviest @xmath14 of @xmath45 ev at the 95% cl .",
    "the most attractive pattern for @xmath14 masses is hierarchical .",
    "using the mass difference of the atmospheric @xmath14 oscillation for the heaviest mass  @xcite , one obtains values between 0.03 and 0.09  ev .",
    "it is an intriguing feature of our result that the smaller one of the predicted masses is compatible on the @xmath5 1.3@xmath46 level with this scenario .",
    "the necessary uhe@xmath14 flux can be obtained from our fits .",
    "we summarized them in fig .",
    "[ eflux ] , together with some upper limits .",
