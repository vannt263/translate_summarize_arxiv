    "the suppression of quarkonium states in heavy - ion collisions was proposed long ago  @xcite as a clean signature of a formation of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "in addition to the color screening mechanism proposed in  @xcite as the main source of suppression , it became soon clear that other effects may contribute , as dissociation in cold nuclear matter  @xcite and/or in the hot confined medium  @xcite .",
    "also initial state effects , such as nuclear shadowing and initial state parton energy loss are expected to play a role  @xcite . on the experimental side ,",
    "lots of data are now available at sps  @xcite and rhic  @xcite energies , and a quarkonium ( q ) suppression beyond cold nuclear matter effects ( the so - called `` anomalous suppression '' ) was detected , either by studying the ratio @xmath6 or the nuclear modification factor @xmath7 , for different collision systems and as a function of the centrality and of the quarkonium kinematic variables  @xcite .",
    "it is commonly accepted that the observed anomalous suppression is likely to be related to the formation of a deconfined state in nuclear collisions . in this situation , the first alice results  @xcite brought in a considerable surprise , showing for the j/@xmath2 clear hints of a smaller suppression , at low transverse momentum , compared to observations at lower energies .",
    "partonic transport models  @xcite , as well as statistical generation models  @xcite , interpret such an effect as being due to a ( re)generation of j/@xmath2 along the collision history and/or at hadronization , favoured by the large @xmath8 multiplicity occurring at lhc energy .",
    "a confirmation of this interpretation clearly requires a comprehensive study of the j/@xmath2 yield in nuclear collisions , with an emphasis on its dependence on kinematic variables .",
    "such a study requires a sizeable pb - pb statistics , which was indeed collected by the alice experiment at the end of 2011 , and results from this data taking are the main object of this paper .",
    "an accurate set of pp data is a fundamental pre - requisite for a study of nuclear effects on any observable .",
    "moreover , important qcd - related topics can be investigated by the study of quarkonium hadro - production in elementary collisions .",
    "we will therefore also summarize the main outcomes of alice pp studies on quarkonia .",
    "alice is the dedicated heavy - ion experiment at the cern lhc .",
    "details on the experimental set - up can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the measurement of quarkonia production is carried out in the central barrel ( @xmath0 ) through their @xmath9 decay , while at forward rapidity ( @xmath1 ) ) . since in pp and pb - pb",
    "the physics is symmetric with respect to @xmath4=0 , we drop the negative sign when quoting rapidity . ] the @xmath10 decay is studied in the muon spectrometer",
    ".    for the measurement in the central barrel , the data acquisition is triggered by a minimum bias condition ( mb ) , essentially defined using information from the two innermost planes of the inner tracker system and from two scintillator arrays ( vzero ) placed at forward rapidities ( -3.7@xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath11 - 1.7 , 2.8@xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath115.1 ) . in pb - pb ,",
    "several centrality classes can be further defined at the trigger level by means of thresholds on the total signal amplitude in the vzero . for the measurement in the forward muon spectrometer , one can require , in addition to the mb condition , one or two ( depending on the data taking ) candidate muons to be detected by the muon triggering system .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper is based , for pb - pb collisions at central rapidity , on a combination of 2010 data , taken with a mb trigger , and 2011 data where , in addition , centrality selections corresponding to very central events ( @xmath13% ) and semi - central events ( @xmath14% ) were performed .",
    "the integrated luminosity is @xmath15 .",
    "the pb - pb forward rapidity results refer to 2011 data ( @xmath16 ) , and were collected by requiring a dimuon trigger , which can select both opposite- and like - sign pairs . in order to properly define @xmath7 , one needs a sample of pp data collected at the same energy ( @xmath17 tev ) and in the same kinematic domain of pb - pb data .",
    "such data were taken in 2011 , collecting @xmath18 with a mb trigger for the central rapidity analysis and @xmath19 with a single - muon trigger for the forward rapidity analysis .",
    "finally , pp data at @xmath20 tev , the top energy of the 2010/2011 lhc data taking , were also collected and analysed , the results presented here referring to integrated luminosities up to @xmath21100 nb@xmath22 .",
    "the signal extraction is performed by means of an analysis of the invariant mass spectra , for both @xmath9 and @xmath10 decay modes . in the electron channel",
    "a large combinatorial background is present , and its size is evaluated using an event mixing technique .",
    "the mixed event sample is then normalized to the opposite sign ( os ) spectrum in the mass region beyond the j/@xmath2 and subtracted out .",
    "the number of signal events is obtained by bin counting in the mass range 2.92 - 3.16 gev/@xmath23 , the factor extrapolating to the full mass range being obtained via monte carlo ( mc ) simulation .",

    "[ fig:1 ] ( right ) , and the total statistics amount to @xmath24 signal events ( the @xmath5 signal contribution has no practical effects on the j/@xmath2 yield , and was neglected in this fit ) .",

    ". typical values amount to @xmath26 in the @xmath0 region ( electrons )  @xcite and @xmath27% for @xmath1 ( muons ) , the latter range of values mainly depending on the choice of the trigger threshold and on the request for 1 or 2 matched muons between tracking and trigger . for the muon channel in pb - pb",
    ", the calculation was done embedding mc j/@xmath2 inside real mb collisions .",
    "the centrality dependence of @xmath25 in pb - pb collisions is found to be weak , not exceeding @xmath28% between central and peripheral events in the muon analysis , and even less in the electron analysis .    for pp collisions ,",
    "the j/@xmath2 yields are then normalized to the integrated luminosity , calculated starting from the number of collected mb events .",
    "the absolute j/@xmath2 cross sections are then obtained relatively to the mb cross section , obtained via a van der meer scan .",
    "the total systematic uncertainty on the cross section measurements ranges , depending on the data taking , between 8 and 12% in the muon channel and between 14 and 18% in the electron channel .    for pb - pb collisions ,",
    "the results are given in terms of the nuclear modification factor @xmath7 , calculated normalizing the j/@xmath2 yield to the corresponding pp cross section times the nuclear overlap function , derived from a glauber calculation .",
    "on these analyses , an important source of ( global ) systematic uncertainty is related to the total error on the pp reference cross section .",
    "it is by far dominant for the electron analysis ( @xmath2126% ) and represents a sizeable contribution also in the muon analysis where for example it accounts for about 50% of the total uncertainty for the integrated @xmath7 .",
    "we first briefly summarize the main results obtained by alice in the study of pp collisions .",
    "these include the calculation of the inclusive production cross sections at @xmath29 and 2.76 tev . at 7 tev",
    "the differential cross sections @xmath30 were obtained at both central and forward rapidity  @xcite , where they showed a good agreement with results from the other lhc experiments ( see  @xcite for a comparison ) in the common kinematic ranges , and were unique for what concerns the low-@xmath3 region at midrapidity . at @xmath31",
    "tev a differential study was possible only in the forward region , while at midrapidity a @xmath3-integrated cross section was obtained , due to the rather small mb integrated luminosity  @xcite .",
    "other interesting studies performed in pp include the first study at lhc energy of the inclusive j/@xmath2 polarization .",
    "the results , published in  @xcite , show that j/@xmath2 production is essentially unpolarized up to @xmath32 gev/@xmath33 .",
    "the study of this observable has critical implications for the theoretical understanding of quarkonium production , since models were quite unable to reproduce coherently the results obtained at lower energy .",
    "however , first comparisons of alice results with nlo nrqcd calculations show an encouraging agreement in the explored @xmath3 range  @xcite . another study unique to alice is the determination of the dependence of the inclusive j/@xmath2 yield on the charged multiplicity measured at central rapidity .",
    "the results , published in  @xcite , show a linear increase of the yield with charged multiplicity , an observation still waiting for a satisfactory explanation from theory .",
    "finally , at midrapidity , alice has provided a first measurement of the fraction of j/@xmath2 from b - decays at low @xmath3 , which also leads to an estimate of the total @xmath34 cross section  @xcite .     @xmath7 vs the number of participant nucleons @xmath35 , compared with results from phenix .",
    "the left plot corresponds to the central rapidity results , the right plot to forward rapidity .",
    "the boxes around the points represent the uncorrelated systematic uncertainties , while the filled boxes on the right correspond to global systematic uncertainties.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]    @xmath7 vs the number of participant nucleons @xmath35 , compared with results from phenix .",

    "[ fig:2 ] the centrality dependence of the inclusive j/@xmath2 nuclear modification factor ( see also @xcite ) , compared with results obtained by phenix .",
    "while lower energy results show an increasing suppression moving towards central collisions , alice results clearly indicate a saturation of the suppression at both central and forward rapidity .",
    "while no final conclusion can be drawn on the relative size of the suppression measured in alice in the two rapidity ranges , mainly due to the large normalization error corresponding to the reference pp cross section , there is a clear evidence for a smaller suppression at lhc with respect to rhic energy .",
    "partonic transport models which include a ( re)generation process for j/@xmath2 due to the recombination of @xmath36 pairs along the history of the collisions indeed predict such a behaviour  @xcite , the smaller suppression at the lhc being due to the larger @xmath36 pair multiplicity which compensates the suppression from color screening in the deconfined phase .",
    "a similar behaviour is obtained by the statistical model  @xcite , where the j/@xmath2 yield is completely determined by the chemical freeze - out conditions and by the abundance of @xmath36 pairs",
    ".    a deeper insight of the mechanisms at play in pb - pb at the lhc can be obtained by studying the centrality dependence of @xmath7 in bins of transverse momentum .",
    "if indeed ( re)generation mechanisms play a role , their impact should be much more important , for simple kinematic arguments , at low transverse momentum .",
    "a larger @xmath7 should then be observed , in particular for central collisions , at low @xmath3 with respect to high @xmath3 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] we separately show the centrality dependence of the j/@xmath2 @xmath7 for @xmath37 and @xmath38 gev/@xmath33 . a larger @xmath7",

    "[ fig:4 ] ( left ) we show the centrality integrated @xmath7 vs rapidity .",

    "a precise determination of shadowing effects and of the j/@xmath2 break - up probability via interactions with cold nuclear matter ( the latter effect might become negligible at the lhc , due to crossing times much smaller than charmonium formation time ) can be obtained by studying p - pb collisions .",
    "such a run will take place at the beginning of 2013 and will help to make the current conclusions from @xmath7 studies more robust .",
    "the differential @xmath7 results previously discussed can be considered as strong hints for an important contribution of ( re)generated j/@xmath2 at low @xmath3 in pb - pb collisions at the lhc .",
