    "the uncertainty is coming from the fact that interband contributions , which can not be separated unambiguously from the drude peak .",
    "this value is slightly lower than the one calculated by lda ( 6.3 ev ) .",
    "however this agreement is good and it suggests that lda describes well the conduction bands near the fermi surface . the temperature dependence of the plasma frequency though appears to be anomalous . as it was mentioned above , the integrated number of carriers decreases for energies above 100 mev when temperature is decreased .",

    "the effect is maximal ( about 10% ) at around 0.7 ev .",
    "normally , the narrowing of the drude peak with a temperature independent plasma frequency results in a slight ( 1 - 2% ) increase of @xmath93 at frequencies 0.5 - 1 ev . in our case one has to assume that the plasma frequency decreases with cooling down . on the other hand , spectral weight",
    "is almost recovered at around 2 ev which is due to the fact that it is transferred from the low frequency range to the region between 0.5 and 2 ev ( fig.[s1temp ] ) .",

    ", we have performed lda calculations at finite temperatures by adding a fermi - dirac distribution for the bands filling in the self consistent calculation .",
    "the thermal expansion was also taken into account using data from ref .. we found that the calculated plasma frequency decreases around @xmath94 with increasing temperature from 0 k to 600 k. both sign and amplitude of the change in the calculated plasma frequency can not explain the experimental observations .",
    "the spectral weight due to interband transitions has also been calculated and found to be almost temperature independent .",
    "therefore a decrease of 10% of the spectral weight is so big that it likely results from a significant change of the electronic band structure .",
    "one can speculate that a certain structural instability is due to the ability of zirconium atoms to move almost freely in spacious boron cages . according to ref .",
    ", a displacement of the metal ion in the @xmath4 cage of about @xmath95 of the unit cell is responsible for the symmetry breaking which makes low frequency zr mode raman - active .",
    "we have therefore calculated the band structure and the plasma frequency as a function of displacement of the metal ion in the directions [ 100],[110 ] and [ 111 ] .",
    "the delocalization configurations are sketched in fig.[diplacement]a .",
    "electron states at the fermi surface are equally coming from zr atoms and @xmath96 cluster ( fig.[bands]b ) .",
    "therefore the highest plasma frequency is obtained when zr ion is in the center of the b@xmath8 cluster .",

    "the displacement of an ion located in the middle of a cage is strongly anisotropic and can be described by a fractionally occupied split site .",

    "this kind of spectral weight transfer is also predicted by the model where the charge carriers are small polarons@xcite . while keeping in mind that they have been derived for a low charge carrier density , the observed direction of the spectral weight transfer agrees with those models .",
