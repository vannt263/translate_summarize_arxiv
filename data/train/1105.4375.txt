    "[ sec : intro ] many interesting phenomena in the physical sciences and in applications are characterized by their high dimensionality and the presence of many different spatial and temporal scales .",
    "standard examples include atmosphere and ocean sciences  @xcite , molecular dynamics  @xcite and materials science  @xcite .",
    "the mathematical description of phenomena of this type quite often leads to infinite dimensional multiscale systems that are described by nonlinear evolution partial differential equations ( pdes ) with multiple scales .",
    "often physical systems are also subject to noise .",
    "this noise might be either due to thermal fluctuations  @xcite , noise in some control parameter  @xcite , coarse - graining of a high - dimensional deterministic system with random initial conditions  @xcite , or the stochastic parameterization of small scales  @xcite .",
    "high dimensional multiscale dynamical systems that are subject to noise can be modeled accurately using stochastic partial differential equations ( spdes ) with a multiscale structure .",
    "there are very few instances where spdes with multiple scales can be treated analytically .",
    "the goal of this paper is to develop numerical methods for solving accurately and efficiently multiscale spdes .",
    "several numerical methods for spdes have been developed and analyzed in recent years , e.g.  @xcite , based on a finite difference scheme in both space and time .",
    "it is well known that explicit time discretization via standard methods ( e.g. , as the euler - maruyama method ) leads to a time - step restriction due to the stiffness originating from the discretisation of the diffusion operator ( e.g. the cfl condition @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the time and space discretization , respectively ) .",
    "the situation is even worse for spdes with multiple scales ( e.g. of the form   and   below ) as in this case the courant - friedrichs - lewy ( cfl ) condition becomes @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the parameter measuring scale separation .",
    "standard explicit methods become useless for spdes with multiple scales .",
    "such time - step restriction can in theory be removed by using implicit methods as was shown in @xcite .",
    "however the implicitness of the numerical scheme forces one to solve potentially large linear algebraic problems at each time step .",
    "furthermore , it was shown in  @xcite that implicit methods are not suited for studying the long time dynamics of fast - slow stochastic systems as they do not capture the correct invariant measure of the system .",
    "although this result has been obtained for finite dimensional stochastic systems , it is expected that it also applies to infinite dimensional fast - slow systems of stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) , rendering the applicability of implicit methods to spdes with multiple scales questionable .",
    "we also note that a new class of explicit methods , the s - rock methods , with much better stability properties than the euler - maruyama method was recently introduced in  @xcite .",
    "although these methods are much more efficient than traditional explicit methods , computing time issues will occur when trying to solve spdes with multiple scales as considered here , since the stiffness is extremely severe for small @xmath5 furthermore , capturing the correct invariant measure of the spde for @xmath6 is still an issue for such solvers .    in this paper",
    "we consider spdes of the form @xmath7 posed in a bounded domain of @xmath8 with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the differential operator @xmath9 is assumed to be a non - positive self - adjoint operator in a hilbert space @xmath10 , @xmath11 denotes space - time gaussian white noise , @xmath12 is the covariance operator of the noise and we take @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that the operator @xmath9 has a finite dimensional kernel , @xmath13 .",
    "this assumption leads to scale separation between the slow dynamics in @xmath13 and the fast dynamics in the orthogonal complement of the null space @xmath14 where @xmath15 . in this paper",
    "we will furthermore assume that noise acts directly only on the orthogonal complement @xmath16 . when noise acts also on @xmath13 , different distinguished limits than the ones considered in this paper should be considered .    in order to describe the longtime behavior of the spdes we perform an _ advective _ rescaling set @xmath17 .",
    "using the scaling properties of white noise we obtain the following singularly perturbed spde @xmath18 another scaling is of interest , namely the _ diffusive _ rescaling @xmath19 which leads to the spde @xmath20 for concreteness , we will focus on the class of spdes with quadratic nonlinearities that was considered in  @xcite , and assume that @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a quadratic function ( e.g. @xmath23 , a symmetric bilinear form ) , @xmath24 a linear function and the exponent @xmath25 is either @xmath26 or @xmath27 . and @xmath24 involve derivatives of the function @xmath28 .",
    "for example , for both the burgers and the kuramoto - shivashinsky equation we have @xmath29 . the linear function @xmath30 is included to induce a linear instability to the dynamics . in the case of the burgers equation",
    "we will simply take @xmath31 whereas in the case of the kuramoto - shivashinsky equation we can take @xmath32 . further discussion can be found in section  [ sec : numerics ] and in  @xcite . ]",
    "the choice of @xmath25 will depend on the particular scaling .",
    "singularly perturbed spdes with quadratic nonlinearities provide a natural testbed for testing the applicability of the heterogeneous multiscale method to infinite dimensional stochastic systems , since a rigorous homogenization theory exists for this class of spdes  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , spdes of this form arise naturally in stochastic models for climate  @xcite and in surface growth  @xcite .",
    "finally , it has already been shown through rigorous analysis and numerical experiments that these systems exhibit a very rich dynamical behavior , such as noise - induced transitions  @xcite and the possibility of stabilization of linearly unstable modes due to the interaction between the additive noise and the scale separation  @xcite .",
    "we believe , however , that the methodology developed in this paper has a wider range of applicability and is not restricted to spdes with quadratic nonlinearities .",
    "further comments about the class of spdes for which we believe that the proposed numerical method can be applied can be found in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "our numerical algorithm is based on a combination of a spectral method with micro - macro time integration schemes .",
    "we denote by @xmath33 the projection onto @xmath13 and by @xmath34 , @xmath35 the projection onto @xmath16 .",
    "we then rewrite   and   as fast - slow system of sdes    [ e : fast_slow_intro_adv ] @xmath36    and    [ e : fast_slow_intro_diff ] @xmath37    where the functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the projections of @xmath40 onto @xmath13 and @xmath16 .",
    "we remark that an @xmath41 nonlinear term can be added in  . the fast - slow systems   and   resemble fast slow systems for sdes (",
    "however , the fast process @xmath42 is infinite dimensional and the well known averaging and homogenization theorems  @xcite do not apply .",
    "averaging and homogenization results for spdes have been obtained recently  @xcite . in particular , provided that the fast process @xmath42 in   has suitable ergodic properties , then the slow variable @xmath43 converges , in the limit as @xmath44 tends to @xmath45 to the solution of the averaged equation @xmath46 where the averaged coefficient is given by the average of @xmath47 with respect to the invariant measure of the ( infinite dimensional ) fast process @xmath42 .",
    "when this average vanishes ( i.e. the centering condition from homogenization theory is satisfied ) then the dynamics at the advective time scale becomes trivial and it is necessary to look at the dynamics at the diffusive time scale , equations  .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the slow variable @xmath43 of this system of equations , the solution of  , converges in the limit as @xmath44 tends to @xmath48 to the solution of the homogenized equation @xmath49 with explicit formulas for the homogenized coefficients  see section  [ sec : multisc ] for details . for finite dimensional fast systems ,",
    "the coefficients in   and   can be calculated , in principle , in terms of appropriate long - time averages  see  @xcite for details .",
    "the numerical method proposed in  @xcite and analyzed in  @xcite , coined under the name of the heterogeneous multiscale method ( hmm ) , relies on the numerical approximation of the coefficients in   and   by solving the original fine scale problem on time intervals of an intermediate time scale and use that data to evolve the slow variables using either   or  . in this paper",
    "we show how this methodology , when combined with a spectral method , can also be applied to spdes with multiple scales , that is , to the systems and .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to present the algorithm and report numerical experiments .",
    "the analysis of the proposed numerical method and the extension to more general classes of spdes with multiscale structure will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : algorithm ] we present our new algorithm .",
    "analytical and computational techniques for the analysis of spdes with multiple scales at the heart of the multiscale algorithm are presented in  [ sec : multisc ] . in section  [ sec : numerics ] we present numerical experiments .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] is reserved for conclusions and discussion on future work .",
    "we propose a numerical algorithm to approximate numerically the solution of based on a micro - macro algorithm , capable of capturing the effective behavior of the spde .",
    "we explain the numerical algorithm for the case of diffusive time scale ( the hardest numerically ) and comment on the advective time scale later in this section .",
    "we consider spdes in a hilbert space @xmath10 with norm @xmath50 and inner product @xmath51 .",
