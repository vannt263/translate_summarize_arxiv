    "it is now clear that the environment is a primary factor in galaxy evolution , either through direct influences , or because galaxy density is a tracer of the important underlying drivers of evolution , such as galaxy mass or formation time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the importance of the environment may be a strong function of cosmic epoch ; even if environmental dependencies are constant with redshift @xcite , galaxies themselves are located in progressively more dense regions with time . on the other hand ,",
    "properties of galaxies such as their mass are also predictors of their evolution and trends with density are in part driven by underlying mass - density biases .",
    "@xcite . understanding the complex interdependencies of mass and environment over the history of the universe , and their effect on galaxy formation , is an immense observational endeavor , requiring substantial dynamic range in galaxy and halo mass , environment or density , and time .    at @xmath12 ,",
    "star formation is suppressed in high - density regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but recent studies have shown that by @xmath13 1 star formation has begun to migrate from low to higher - density environments @xcite . still , the highest density regions at any given epoch - galaxy clusters - are difficult to probe precisely because these regions are so rare .",
    "while wide - field surveys probe several orders of magnitude in galaxy density , most do not contain large numbers of galaxy clusters , and for these densities targeted investigations are more efficient .",
    "however , the assessment of the star formation rates of galaxies in high - redshift clusters has been hindered in the past by the inhomogeneity and sparseness of cluster samples , and the different approaches used to quantify the amount of star formation ( sf ) occurring in the cluster environment .",
    "conclusions drawn from the comparison of small numbers of clusters selected through different biases are problematic .",
    "a number of lines of evidence suggest that the star formation efficiency of a cluster is strongly correlated with its total halo mass ( though not necessarily driven by it ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the dynamical state of a cluster at the epoch of observation is likely also very important , as a major merger event could have a profound though temporary effect on the member galaxies .",
    "comparisons between different studies are further complicated by star formation rates that are estimated through different observational diagnostics such as optical emission lines ( [ oii ] , h@xmath15 ) or infrared emission .",
    "these different techniques are biased to different galaxy populations , or may yield different values for the same galaxy either through errors in the calibrations or by probing different star - forming regions .",
    "finally , studies have employed a variety of different cluster member identification methodologies : spectroscopic confirmation , photometric redshifts or color selection , each with different observational limits and completeness functions .",
    "these different approaches have all shown some level of evolution in the sfr of clusters to higher redshift but have varied significantly in their assessment of its magnitude : @xmath16 @xcite    here we present a study of the average ir properties of a large sample of galaxy clusters ( 42 ) drawn in a systematic way from the first red - sequence cluster survey @xcite over the redshift range 0.3 @xmath17 1.0 .",
    "the intent of this work is to undertake a very simple analysis of the global evolution of dust enshrouded activity in cluster environments with time .",
    "our adopted method offers a number of advantages , but is also limited in scope and for clarity we briefly summarize it here .",
    "we perform a simple statistical measurement of the background subtracted ir counts along the line of sight to galaxy clusters .",
    "this provides a clean measurement of the dust - enshrouded activity in clusters that does not require any selection or assumptions beyond a simple ir - luminosity cut .",
    "we do not , for example , require an optical counterpart for the ir sources , which would bias the sample toward less dust - enshrouded objects ; nor do we directly isolate cluster members , which then requires a member completeness correction and is again biased .",
    "thus , we will be sensitive to _ all _ activity above our detection limit . throughout",
    "we make the simplification that the ir luminosity is entirely produced by star - formation , with no agn contamination .",
    "this assumption is likely an oversimplification @xcite and does not affect the primary conclusions of the paper which depend only on the ir luminosity , not the source of activity .",
    "we discuss agn throughout the paper , when they are relevant to the conclusions .    on the other hand",
    ", this statistical method limits us to the cluster averaged activity and can not tell us anything about the individual galaxies .",
    "therefore we can not control for galaxy specific properties such as stellar mass and this limits the implication of the results .",
    "more detailed analysis of the ir galaxy population in this cluster sample will be undertaken in future papers , nevertheless , important conclusions may be drawn from this simple study alone .    the paper is laid - out as follows . in ",
    "2 we outline the rcs cluster sample selection and describe the _ spitzer _ observations , data reduction and source extraction . in ",
    "3 we describe the number count analysis methodology and in  4 we present the results . ",
    "4.1 presents the evolution of the statistical excess of ir galaxies seen in the rcs cluster fields and describes sources of systematic error in this analysis ;  4.2 converts these measurements to the evolution of the integrated star formation per unit cluster mass ;  4.3 compares this evolution to that of the ir - bright field population ; in  4.4 we look at the dependence of these results on cluster richness or mass ; and  4.5 presents the radial distribution of the ir - luminous population in clusters . in  5 we discuss the implications of these results and in  6 we summarize the primary conclusions of the paper .",

    "it was designed to optimize the detection of galaxy clusters in the redshift range @xmath23 through the detection of the red sequence of early - type galaxies within the cluster core .",

    "in so doing , we have assembled a sample which is no longer representative of the rcs selection distribution in mass or redshift , but rather comprises a representative sample with the goal of isolating the effects of redshift and cluster properties on cluster galaxy evolution .",

    "however , the results of  4.4 indicate that as a cluster grows in mass its integrated sfr per unit mass will decrease following figure [ richness ] .",
    "if we account for this additional shutting down of star formation , due not to the overall change in the in - falling population but to the change in the parent halo ( again using the halo growth models of @xcite ) the assembled stellar mass is reduced by roughly a factor of two , or to 5% .",
    "the descedent population is harder to constrain .",

    "@xcite ) and indeed is expected from the properties of local ( i.e. @xmath470 ) galaxy clusters .",
    "the stellar mass fraction of clusters decreases with increasing cluster mass @xcite as does the metal enrichment of the icm , while total gas mass increases @xcite .",
    "this implies cluster star formation efficiency that is dependent on the halo mass , such that high mass halos turn a smaller fraction of their baryonic mass into stars",
    ". this could be the result of a constant dependence of the quenching efficiency of clusters on mass over all time , so that while accreting more mass from the field , high mass clusters preferentially return the gas to the igm rather than process it into stars .",
    "additionally , this difference could reflect a change in environmental quenching mechanisms with time . at a given epoch clusters with different halo masses",
    "have different formation histories , assembly times and galaxy population ages .",
    "n - body simulations , local stellar population studies , and high - redshift observations of clusters indicate that high mass clusters formed a larger fraction of their stars at earlier times @xcite than lower mass systems , thereby imprinting temporal variations on global star formation efficiencies on the cluster galaxy populations .    over the mass range probed here ( @xmath1110@xmath1m@xmath2 ) local clusters",
    "show a m@xmath89/m@xmath90 dispersion of approximately an order of magnitude .",
    "the simplest interpretation of this is that their star formation efficiency follows the same ratio ( with the higher mass clusters an order of magnitude less efficient at forming stars than the lower mass systems ) , at least averaged over all time .",
    "our measured relation of the @xmath6sfr / m@xmath7 is consistent with this at @xmath111@xmath36 , and therefore does not require a change in the quenching efficiency of star formation with redshift ; that is , the difference between high and low mass clusters can be accounted for by the relation we see below @xmath14 1 , and does not require differences to be set in place at early times . according to these measurements , high and low mass clusters have assembled roughly the same amount of stellar mass since @xmath14 1 , though this represents a smaller fraction of the total stellar mass of high mass clusters .",
    "thus , we confirm the fraction of a cluster s stellar mass that was formed at high redshifts increases with cluster mass .",
    "this is also in line with the richness dependent downsizing effect observed by @xcite ( but ( c.f .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : lower mass clusters show a larger deficit of faint red sequence galaxies than high mass clusters to @xmath14 1 .",
    "the above interpretation is in line with the properties of low redshift halos , but it is not the only possible explanation for figure [ richness ] . disentangling the effects of environment and galaxy mass is notoriously difficult and could be important here .",
    "the specific star formation rate of individual galaxies is known to decrease with increasing mass even to @xmath14 1 @xcite and thus if the mass function of in - falling galaxies varies with parent halo mass , such that high mass clusters preferentially accrete high mass galaxies , this would be reflected in the overall specific star formation rate of the clusters .",
    "this scenario is not supported by the recent measurements of the mass function of galaxies surrounding clusters to @xmath14 1 of @xcite , and would nevertheless be too weak an effect to produce what is seen here . still , n - body simulations do highlight a significant difference in the accretion history of halos with mass .",
    "@xcite show that high mass clusters form preferentially from group accretion , or the accretion of halos with m@xmath5510@xmath86m@xmath2 , whereas lower mass systems primarily accrete isolated field galaxies . in this scenario star formation",
    "is first suppressed by the local environment @xcite before accretion onto a massive halo and the apparent dependence on the global environment is simply a reflection of the mass function of accreted halos and the larger number of groups falling into the highest mass clusters .    finally , we recall that the rcs clusters are optically selected with the mass estimated through optical richness measurements .",
    "this means that our sample is fundamentally a stellar - mass limited sample , rather than a halo - mass limited sample .",
    "this could introduce a systematic bias in stellar - to - total mass ratio with total mass . at the high mass end",
    "we will be complete for all possible ratios , but at low mass we could be biased to clusters with high stellar mass content , and therefore those systems which have experienced more efficient star formation for the same dark matter halo mass .",
    "this would take a flat @xmath6sfr / m@xmath7 relation and tilt it negatively by biasing the low mass clusters upwards .",
    "such an effect should be recoverable provided one has an independent estimate of the total mass , which we currently do not .",
    "figure [ radialfig ] confirms the decrease in star - formation rate per unity galaxy toward high density regions - the so - called star - formation - rate density relation which has been well - established by many authors .",
    "while field studies show that the relation begins to reverse beyond @xmath14 1 @xcite , evidence of it reaching cluster core densities below @xmath14 1.6 @xcite is not yet conclusive . as with the evolutionary effect discussed above",
    ", it is exceedingly difficult to directly compare the results of different studies .",
    "the absolute value of the fraction of star forming galaxies depends on the depth and method of the star formation rate estimates and the method of assessing the underlying cluster population .",
    "nevertheless , most studies see a smooth decline in the fraction of star forming galaxies of about an order of magnitude from the outer regions of the cluster ( @xmath91 ) to the core @xcite .",
    "it is now clear that some , but not all , of this trend is due to the underlying mass - bias @xcite ; the average mass of galaxies increases towards the cluster core and the lower ssfr of higher mass galaxies drives down the average star formation rate .",
    "the statistics of our study are already too poor to do much beyond describe the overall decline ( see caption of figure [ radialfig ] ) in star formation in the cluster centers .",
    "however , it would be interesting in future work to investigate the rate of decline for galaxy populations of different star formation rates or specific star formation rates as this would provide further information on the galaxy dependent properties of the quenching mechanisms .",
    "the simple statistical exercise presented here leads to a number of important conclusions :    1 .",
    "we see an steep increase in the number of ir - luminous galaxies ( l@xmath92 2@xmath310@xmath4l@xmath2 ) per cluster mass ( and by inference @xmath6sfr / m@xmath7 ) of @xmath93 over the range 0.3 @xmath71 1.0 .",
    "this evolution is in agreement with that estimated by other ir studies of galaxy clusters @xcite and shows the same level of increase as seen in extinction corrected optical studies to similar sfr depths @xcite . assuming the optical population is contained within the ir population ( this has not been demonstrated ) , this indicates that the optical studies are not missing a significant fraction of dust enshrouded activity .",
    "we show that the above rapid evolution can be accounted for entirely by the evolution in the in falling field population .",
    "moreover , we show that the amount of ir - traced star formation per unit halo mass in clusters and the field are consistent ; once normalized for halo mass clusters do not show an excess or in star formation deficit relative to the field .",
    "3 .   the ir luminous in - falling population seen here to @xmath141 can account for 5 - 10% of the total stellar mass in massive clusters today .",
    "until we have an estimate of the stellar mass function of these galaxies , it is not certain how much of this population contributes to the build - up of the faint - end of the red - sequence observed in clusters over this timeframe .",
    "4 .   averaged over all redshifts , we see a decrease in the @xmath6sfr / m@xmath7 with increasing galaxy richness of @xmath6sfr / m@xmath94m@xmath10 .",
    "this means that the sfr of an individual halo decreases more sharply with time than the simple number count analysis implies .",
    "the relation is consistent with a constant dependence of quenching efficiency ( but does not require it ) on halo mass over all time and can reproduce the dependence of the stellar - to - total mass ratio on mass seen in local clusters .",
    "the radial distribution of ir galaxies in clusters is flat , with perhaps a slight increase towards the centers .",
    "this is seemingly in agreement with other studies which claim enhanced star formation in the centers of high redshift clusters .",

    "if , however , the scosmos go3 field is located in a region of the sky of true galaxy under density at all relevant luminosities , this could introduce a trend similar to that observed .",
    "again , our analysis of the number counts using our own photometry indicates that the number density of 24@xmath37 m sources in scosmos is in good agreement with other fields , and this is confirmed by the very careful analysis of the scosmos team @xcite .    a final possibility is an increased level of asteroid contamination in the rcs fields .",
    "we have not removed asteroids in either the rcs or scosmos images , thus if the rcs - mips fields contain a higher number of asteroids than scosmos , with the number density of asteroids increasing with decreasing flux , this might mimic redshift evolution .",
    "we have checked this by plotting the excess ir counts against the ecliptic latitude of each cluster and see no correlation . moreover",
    ", the scosmos field lies at lower ecliptic latitude than any of our clusters and therefore should have _ more _ asteroids .",
    "therefore , it does not appear that our analysis method or inherent differences between the cluster and field catalogs are likely to create a false increase in ir galaxies in the higher redshift bins .",
    "+ * luminosity calculations : * we adopt the chary & elbaz ( 2001 ) and dale & helou ( 2002 ) libraries of ir luminous galaxy templates to predict an observed 24@xmath37 m flux for l@xmath54 2@xmath3 10@xmath45l@xmath2 for each cluster and are therefore applying the same sed to all redshifts .",
    "the chary & elbaz sed library has been demonstrated to accurately reproduce the total ir luminosity of field galaxies below @xmath95 , particularly for galaxies with l @xmath96 10@xmath97 l@xmath98 which dominate our number counts , even when extrapolated from a single 24@xmath37 m measurement ( magnelli et al .",
    "2009 ; murphy et al . 2009 ; chary 2010 ) .",
    "thus , field studies show no evidence of a strong evolution in the ir sed over this redshift range and we therefore do not expect this to be a substantial effect .",
    "nevertheless , if the average sed of ir galaxies within clusters changes with redshift we could be measuring the number counts to different intrinsic luminosities at different cosmic epochs . to reproduce the observed trend of increasing numbers of ir galaxies at high - redshift requires an enhancement of 24@xmath37 m flux for a given l@xmath48 in the higher redshift bins .",
    "an obvious means of accomplishing this is through increased agn contamination as the presence of hot dust surrounding an agn would produce excess mir emission thereby boosting galaxies above the luminosity limit .    to investigate this possibility",
    "we have computed the irac mir colours of the 24@xmath37 m galaxies in each cluster field ( to the corresponding luminosity limit ) ; the mir has been used to roughly classify galaxies as possible dusty agn @xcite through their location on an irac color - color plot .",
    "we measured the fraction of 24@xmath37 m galaxies in the cluster fields which have colors consistent with agn according to the lacy et al .",
    "classification in three separate redshift bins above @xmath61 0.5 and find no change in this fraction with redshift .",
    "however , given the small number of excess ir galaxies in each cluster field ( 2 - 20 galaxies per cluster ) , relative to the high source density of the background , color differences will be difficult to detect using this statistical method and the results are therefore not strongly conclusive .",
    "this will be investigated in later work using more extensive imaging and spectroscopy .",
    "we further note that a change in the ir sed with redshift , due to increasing agn or other physics , simply means the evolution in number counts can not be interpreted as an increase in the total sfr ; it is still a real and interesting evolutionary trend . + * adopted radii : * since we are counting galaxies within a given radius for each cluster and the density of ir galaxies themselves may not be constant with cluster - centric distance , the accuracy of the analysis also relies on the adoption of a consistent radial cut , taken here to be @xmath29 , or the approximate virial radius .",
    "we calculate @xmath29 from the observed galaxy richness n@xmath25 , which is an indicator of mass reliable to @xmath1130 - 50% ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* gilbank et al . in preparation ) .",
    "we choose not to attempt to correct for incompleteness in the highest redshift bins by assuming a constant lf , since we know that the faint end of the red - sequence becomes increasingly depopulated towards higher redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in a way which approximately mimics incompleteness .",
    "systematic offsets in the measured n@xmath99 with redshift could introduce a corresponding trend in the number counts .",
    "for example , if the galaxy population in the cores of clusters evolves substantially between @xmath100 an optically estimated n@xmath25 is unlikely to have a uniform conversion to total cluster mass . in this case",
    "we would expect the same n@xmath25 to correspond to a more massive system at high redshift ( because the galaxies are bluer ) , compared to low redshift .",
    "this would lead to an underestimate of @xmath29 and therefore a decrease in the corresponding number counts , but also an underestimate of the mass normalization , thereby boosting the measurement .",
    "however , initial spectroscopic results ( gilbank et al . in preparation ) do not show a significant effect .",
    "the counts and mass normalization depend on different powers of the richness measure , n@xmath25 .",
    "as outlined in  3 , we determine @xmath29 by first transforming n@xmath25 to a velocity dispersion ( @xmath36 ) , following @xmath101 ; the radius is then linearly proportional to @xmath36 . assuming a flat radial distribution of ir galaxies (  4.5 ) the absolute number counts will increase with the area , or as @xmath102 .",
    "the mass is a slightly stronger function of radius , rising as @xmath103 .",
    "these competing dependencies result in a bias upwards in the number counts per unit mass , but the effect can not reproduce the evolution for any reasonable error in richness .",
    "for example , a systematic underestimate of the optical richness in the @xmath47 0.9 bin of @xmath1130% would require a correction of the counts downward by @xmath1110% , preserving a strong evolutionary trend .",
    "thus a large systematic in richness measurements with redshifts can steepen the evolution , but can not completely account for it .",
    "we have further checked this effect using the irac imaging for the @xmath53 0.5 sample .",
    "we carry out a similar number count analysis as in the rest of the paper where we measure the number of galaxies within a given radius and above a uniform luminosity limit , and perform background ( line - of - sight ) subtraction . in this case",
    "we have chosen 0.5 @xmath3 @xmath29 , to maximize s / n , and m@xmath104 @xmath105 m@xmath106 + 1 , to remain well above the irac limiting depths at all redshifts .",
    "this is not a perfect reproduction of the mips analysis method since the optical / nir galaxies are unlikely to have the same radial distribution as the ir galaxies (  4.4 ) at 0.5 @xmath29 , and the luminosity conversion method is different , but it should provide a handle on the importance of large systematic errors in the counts due to systematics in the radii . within small radii , irac traces the stellar mass of the early - type galaxies dominating the core and should show very little evolution with redshift ( in particular since these systems have been selected by the existence of an old optical population ) .",
    "thus , any large evolutionary trends in the irac counts may be attributed to systematic effects .",
    "in fact , figure [ irac ] shows no trend of increasing optical galaxy counts with redshift , in stark contrast to the mips analysis .",
    "m or 4.5@xmath374 m ) within 0.5 @xmath29 and brighter than m@xmath26 + 1 , after background subtraction .",
    "the black points correspond to individual clusters and the yellow points show the weighted average within three redshift bins .",
    "here we show the background - subtracted 24@xmath37 m counts in constant radii of 1mpc and without normalizing for the inferred cluster mass .",
    "this plot makes no assumptions or corrections for the differences in counts which are due to differences in the cluster mass and does not infer an @xmath29 radius .",
    "it should therefore be free from uncertainties introduced through errors in the assumed optical - richness - mass relation , or its intrinsic scatter .",
    "on the other hand , working at a fixed radius and not accounting for mass should result in a larger scatter - assuming the corrections are properly applied .",
    "this is because 1mpc corresponds to a larger fraction of @xmath29 for poor clusters , compared to richer clusters , and because higher richness clusters may have larger numbers of all galaxy populations - including the ir - luminous systems .",
    "the increased number of ir - luminous galaxies in higher mass clusters appears robust in that it is present in both the uncorrected raw data , and ( at a higher level ) for the corrected data . for the mass - uncorrected data shown here the evolution goes as @xmath107 where @xmath604.4@xmath341.9 , compared to @xmath605.1@xmath341.9 for the corrected version .",
    "m galaxies above an inferred luminosity of 2@xmath320@xmath4 l@xmath2 within the same radius of 1mpc for all clusters .",
    "this plot is the same as the upper panel in figure 4 , however it does not include the mass normalization and does not alter the counting radius according to the cluster richness .",
    "the solid line is the best - fit power law function of n @xmath11 ( 1+z)@xmath108 .",
