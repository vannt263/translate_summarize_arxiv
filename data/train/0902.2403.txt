    "it is well understood that the stellar masses of galaxies are better examined with near - ir ( nir ) observations compared to shorter wavelengths mainly because the near - ir light is relatively less affected by recent episodes of star formation and by internal dust extinction .",
    "moreover , the k - corrections are also smaller and better constrained in the nir and hence massive high redshift objects are relatively prominent in the nir . despite this relative insensitivity to luminosity evolution and the effects of dust , the hope of using the nir counts to constrain the cosmological parameters has not proved feasible because evolution in the space density of galaxies was soon understood to be of comparable significance for the nir counts as the cosmological curvature @xcite .",
    "disentangling the effects of cosmology from evolution is not straightforward even in the nir , and now it has become more appropriate to turn the question around and make use of the impressive constraints on the cosmological parameters from wmap @xcite , and type ia supernovae @xcite , in order to measure more carefully the rate of evolution . in addition , imaging in the nir has progressed well with fully cryogenic wide - field imagers now available on several 4 m class telescopes .",
    "we also have at our disposal now much better estimates of the luminosity functions of different classes of galaxies from the large local redshift surveys in particular the sdss @xcite , or 2dfgrs @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the luminosity functions has been addressed making use of spectroscopic redshift surveys . however , the results of those studies differ due to the limitations in terms of low statistic , or small fields probed which lead to uncertainties due to the large scale structure . in a mild ( 20 - 30% ) evolution in the number density of massive objects since",
    "@xmath8 is found .",
    "also a roughly constant number density for red galaxies to @xmath9 is found in @xcite . using combo-17 photometric redshift information , and the rest - frame color bimodality at each redshift",
    ", @xcite with a sample of @xmath1025000 galaxies , concluded that the stellar mass in red - galaxies has increase in a factor 2 - 3 from @xmath8 to the present . combining spectroscopic with photometric redshift data point to an increase in a factor of @xmath11 for the density of red bulge - dominated galaxies between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite found a different evolution since @xmath8 in number densities in the red and blue galaxy population , being constant for the blue galaxies , while the number density of the red galaxies increases in a factor 3 .",
    "wide field imaging with larger covered area , and greater numbers selected to uniform faint limits is complementary to the redshift surveys in examining statistical models proposed for evolution .    in practical terms",
    "it is most useful to combine faint nir counts with deep blue counts when examining models of evolution to contrast the effects of luminosity and density evolution which affect these two spectral ranges in different ways . in @xcite",
    "the authors use non - evolving models with a higher @xmath14 normalization in the b - band even if this leads to an over - prediction of bright galaxies than is observed . pointed out that both the optical and nir counts present an excess over the no - evolution models , finding passive evolution models more suitable to match the distributions .",
    "the authors emphasize nevertheless their disappointment with the fact that in the passive evolution models the faint number counts are dominated by early - type galaxies , whereas the real data show that spiral and sd / irr galaxies are the main contributors to the faint counts even in the k - band .",
    "a characteristic feature of the nir galaxy counts reported in several works is the change of slope at @xmath15 .",
    "this distinctive flattening is not observed in the b - band counts .",
    "this effect has been interpreted in terms of a change in the dominant galaxy population , becoming increasingly dominated by an intrinsically bluer population @xcite . in the model described in @xcite a delay in the formation of the bulk of the early - type galaxies to @xmath16 and the presence of a dwarf star - forming population are invoked to match the ks - band counts .",
    "a similar dwarf star - forming population at @xmath17 , that is not present at lower redshift was found compatible in @xcite but that work uses a @xmath18 cosmology , requiring some revision .",
    "alternatively , an increase of @xmath14 for late - type galaxies , driven via mergers , can produce similar results without introducing an ad hoc population that is unseen in the local lfs @xcite . in any case",
    ", a low @xmath19 for the ellipticals remains necessary to generate a significant decrease in the number of red galaxies and to account for the distinctive break in the nir count slope at ks@xmath1017.5 .",
    "here we use the nir data from the first completed alhambra field , hereafter alh08 ( details of the project can be found in @xcite and http://www.iaa.es/alhambra ) .",
    "the limiting magnitudes ( at s / n=5 in an aperture diameter of 2@xmath20fwhm ) reached in the 3 nir bands are in mean for the eight frames in alh8 : j=22.6 , h=21.5 and ks=20.1 with a 0.3 rms ( vega system ) , and the total area covered amounts to @xmath21 square degrees .",
    "the completed survey will cover 8 independent fields with a total area of 4 square degrees .",
    "the alhambra survey occupies a middle ground in terms of the product of depth and area in all three standard nir filters .",
    "the bright end of the counts is well constrained by our relatively large area allowing a careful examination of the location and size of the break in the count - slopes in j , h and ks at fainter magnitudes .",
    "we have paid special attention to s / g separation , which at the intermediate magnitude range , is effectively achieved using optical - nir color indices by combining our alh08 nir data with the corresponding sloan dr5 data .",
    "unless specified otherwise , all magnitudes here are presented in the vega system , and the favored cosmological model , with h@xmath22  , @xmath23 , @xmath24 was adopted through this paper .",
    "the alhambra survey is collecting data in 23 optical - nir filters using the calar alto 3.5 m telescope with the cameras laica for the 20 optical filters , and omega2000 for the nir , jhks filters @xcite . in this paper",
    "we discuss the galaxy number counts in the j , h and ks bands computed in the completed alh08 pointing . due to the omega2000 and laica geometries ,",

    "the plate scale is 0.45 arcsec / pixel , giving a full field of view of @xmath10236 arcmin@xmath27 .",
    "the jhks images were taken using a dither pattern of 20 positions , with single images time exposures of 80  s in j , 60  s in h and 46  s in ks band ( obtained using respectively 16 , 20 and 23 software co - adds ) .",
    "the total exposure time was 5  ks in each of the three filters .    due to the high quantity of raw data images",
    "we have implemented a dedicated reduction pipeline to process the images .",
    "this code will be presented and discussed in a forthcoming technical paper .",
    "the use of the reduction pipeline guaranties the homogeneity of the process , and allows us to perform a first automatic analysis of the resulting images and to verify the quality of the products in real time .",
    "the magnitude at the 50% of recovery efficiency for point - like sources in the eight final images corresponds in average to j@xmath28 , h@xmath29 and ks@xmath30 in the vega system .",

    "firstly , the individual images of each observing run were dark - subtracted , and flat - fielded by super - flat images constructed with the science images in each filter . in the case of nir imaging it is specially important to remove properly the high sky level that is changing in short timescales .",
    "the sky structure of each image was removed with the xdimsum package @xcite with a sky image constructed with the median of the 6 images closest in acquisition time , which in the case of the j , h , ks filters correspond to timescales of 480 , 360 , 276  s respectively . during this",
    "process cosmic ray masks for each individual image were also created .",
    "sextractor was used with the preliminary sky subtracted images to compute the number of detected objects ( above a given s / n and with ellipticity lower than a certain limit ) , and to make a robust estimate of the fwhm of each image .",
    "this information together with the sky level variation was used to automatically remove low s / n images , lying outside the survey requirements , and also to identify exposures presenting problems such as telescope trailing .",
    "the readout of the detector array produces ghost images coming from bright stars . as those spurious effects are replicated in all the readout channels ( separated by 128 pixels ) of the detector s quadrant where the real bright source is located , it was possible to mask them before image combination .",
    "linear patterns produced by moving objects were located in the images using two different approaches : i ) objects with high ellipticity and pixel area were identified from the individual image sextractor catalogs .",
    "ii ) linear patterns split in multiple spots and structures were located using the hough transform .",
    "linear patterns detected by any of the two methods were masked .",
    "using xdimsum , the images were combined masking the cosmic rays , bad pixels and linear patterns . those preliminary co - added images were used to create object and bright cores masks .",
    "object masks were used to cover the sources in the second iteration of the xdimsum sky subtraction procedure .",
    "bright cores masks operate when constructing an improved version of the cosmic ray masks .    at this point ,",
    "the individual images have been dark current corrected , flat fielded and sky subtracted .",
    "each individual image has an associated mask containing the bad pixels , cosmic rays , linear patterns and ghost images .    to perform the final combination of the processed images we used swarp @xcite , a code that combines the images , correcting at the same time the geometrical distortions in the individual images using the information stored in wcs headers .",
    "the astrometric calibration of each individual image and the update of its wcs headers was done by the pipeline using an automatic module . during the swarp combination the extinction variations among the images",
    "were also corrected .",
    "more technical details on the image combination are given in appendix  [ ap : combination ] .",
    "for the photometric calibration we used the 2mass catalogs @xcite .",
    "after having combined all the images of each pointing , the objects in common with the 2mass catalogs were found and those with higher signal to noise ratio selected to compute a zero point offset .    in fig .",

    "[ fig:2mass3 ] . the mean value for the rms is @xmath31 mags , and a mean of 36 calibration sources have been used in each frame .",
    "we have not found any appreciable color related trend .",
    "the calibrated images were inspected for the possible presence of ring patterns that would have been produced by pupil ghosts .",
    "we computed for each band , and for all the sources used in the calibration process of the different final frames , the difference between our photometry and the 2mass photometry as a function of the radial distance to the nominal field center .",
    "we found a significant effect , over 0.02 mags only in the j - band images , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : radial ] .",
    "this effect was corrected by fitting the pupil ghost , using the mscpupil task in the iraf mscred package @xcite , and removing this pupil image from the flat - fields and individual images .",
    "the final resulting radial differences are shown for the j band in fig .",
    "[ fig : radial2 ] where it clearly appears that all the systematics was corrected well below the @xmath32 level .",
    "the steps to compute robust counts to the 50% detection level of the images are similar to those described in @xcite and in @xcite . in the next section",
    "we detail how the best set of sextractor parameters was estimated as a compromise between optimizing the depth at the 50% completeness level while keeping low the number of spurious sources .      in order to compute the corrections that should be applied to the faint part of the galaxy counts we have performed a set of monte carlo simulations where real sources from the images were injected back to the same science image at different positions .",
    "the completeness correction to be applied depends on the surface brightness profile of the source . to account for this",
    "we computed a different correction function for sources in three effective radius ( re ) intervals .",
    "those re intervals in pixels for the simulations were chosen from the histogram of the fig .",
    "[ fig : rerec ] ( top panel ) : @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rerec ] ( bottom panel ) it is shown how the re recovered decreases as the magnitude goes fainter ( see below for a description of how these values were obtained ) .",
    "for the simulations , bright sources were selected from the image in each re interval .",
    "these sources were artificially dimmed to the 0.5 magnitude bin under study and injected back on the image randomly . in each iteration",
    "40 sources were simulated , computing the recovering fraction and the robust mean ( trimming the 10% on either side of the distribution ) of the sextractor desired output parameters differences between the dimmed input sources and the recovered ones . using 9 of these iterations in each magnitude bin",
    ", we estimated the mean and rms of the recovered fraction , and sextractor parameters differences over all the meaningful magnitude range . in fig .",
    "[ fig : completeness ] the completeness correction for the three re ranges is shown for one of the pointings in the j band .",
    "it can be argued that with that method unrealistic pseudo - artificial sources could be produced .",
    "whereas this could be true , the goal of this procedure is to parameterize the recovering efficiency on the basis of the source and image characteristics without any physical consideration , which will be implicitly taken into account when performing the corrections on the real data . as a validation of the procedure",
    ", the same simulations have been performed using real nicmos f110w sources from the hdf - s flanking fields .",
    "the nicmos images were resampled and convolved with a suitable gaussian kernel to match the pixel scale and fwhm of the omega2000 image under study .",
    "initial sources were taken in the interval [ m-1,m+1 ] ( being m the magnitude under study ) , which produces a realistic @xmath36 relation . as can be seen from the fig .",
    "[ fig : completeness ] the results in the completeness correction are the same that using dimmed sources from the image .    in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : profprof ] we show the depth to the 50% and 80% of recovering efficiency , computed using a linear interpolation in the magnitude vs. efficiency data .",
    "the figure indicates that a decreasing of the detection thresholds , in order to get a fainter level at the 50% of recovery efficiency limit , will not improve by much the limit at the 80% of completeness , which seems to reach a plateau .",
    "moreover , as will be seen from the reliability plots , it produces a significant increase of detected spurious sources , as we explain below .      to accurately compute the galaxy number counts",
    "it is important to establish the reliability of the detections at the faint magnitude end . to find out the optimum way to evaluate that reliability",
    "we have studied the performance of three different methods . the first approach was to create artificial sky images with the same rms and background distribution than the real ones . the ratio of spurious versus real detections was computed running sextractor over the science and the artificial sky images .",
    "we have also inspected the performance of the method used in @xcite .",
    "basically half exposure time images were created from two complementary sets of the data .",
    "the detections were performed in the total time image and the source fluxes measured in the half time images using the sextractor double image mode for the same automatic apertures .",
    "those created sources showing a magnitude difference greater than @xmath37 were considered spurious .    the last method and the one that , at the end , produces the best results , consisted in constructing sky images using a similar combination procedure that the used to create the science images : combining the unregistered processed images with subtracted background using an artificial dither pattern .",
    "the major difficulty here was to remove the extended sources that could bias the sky even when doing trimmed mean ( discarding 20% of the pixels at each side ) .",
    "we have confirmed that sextractor does locate these smooth deviations over the sky rms when filtering is used . to avoid this we multiplied those sky images by -1 and used them as real sky images .    in the fig .",
    "[ fig : spuvsspu ] we show a comparison between the spurious rate at the 50% of detection efficiency computed over the real sky and the artificial sky . a good agreement between both methods",
    "is observed , indicating that the use of artificial images to compute the ratio of spurious to total detections is adequate .",
    "being artificial images faster to construct we made use of them to estimate the detection reliability in each pointing .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : profprof ] shows the magnitude reached at the 50% of detection efficiency versus the spurious to total ratio at the same magnitude bin . from the figure",
    "we can see that in order to reach a deep 50% detection limiting magnitude , maintaining at the same time the number of spurious detections below 20% , the optimum sextractor detect_thresh - filter combinations are : detect_thresh=1.2 or 1.4 without filtering , or detect_thresh=0.8 using a filtering with a gaussian kernel of size similar to the image fwhm . in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : profprof ] it is shown that those combinations reach roughly the same magnitude at the 80% of recovery efficiency .",
    "we have decided to use the latter filter - detect_thresh combination because , as can be outlined from the bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : magrec ] , the differences between the input and the recovered auto magnitudes in the simulations are close to zero in all the magnitude range up to the magnitude at the 80% of recovery efficiency .",
    "close to the magnitude at the 50% of completeness the recovered magnitude appears to be @xmath38 mag brighter than in the previous bin .",
    "this effect could be due to the fact than only those sources that suffer from noise brightening were found by sextractor and used to compute the input - output magnitude differences , producing a bias towards brighter recovered objects . following those results , the number counts in the following sections will be computed and corrected up to the magnitude of 80% of recovery efficiency for point - like sources , avoiding any possible systematics due to a magnitude shift at the 50% completeness bin .    as pointed before ,",
    "the photometry of the sources was obtained using mag_auto .",
    "simulations indicate no significant differences between simulated and recovered magnitudes ( at the 80% recovery efficiency ) for the used values of the sextractor parameters filter and detect_thresh . using the same kind of simulations we computed the rms of the recovered mag_auto values in each bin to characterize the photometric error , the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : magerror ] .      in @xcite",
    "it was shown that fainter than ks=17.0 the correction due to stars is @xmath39 dex .",
    "however , given the lower galactic latitude of the alh08 field , a higher number of contaminating stars is expected .",
    "a correct star subtraction is relevant in the intermediate magnitude range . at bright magnitudes stars",
    "can be easily separated from galaxies using a compactness criteria .",
    "in contrast , at intermediate magnitudes the star / galaxy separation is more demanding because many galaxies are barely resolved with small apparent sizes compared with the fwhm and pixel resolution , as can be seen from the diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : peakiso ] .    the viability of star / galaxy separation using the sextractor neural network has also been analyzed .",
    "for this purpose , using the same monte carlo method explained before , bright stars and galaxies from the images have been artificially dimmed to each magnitude bin and their sextractor stellarity parameter recovered . in fig .",
    "[ fig : classstar1 ] it clearly appears how , in one final frame with fwhm=1.1 , the input and recovered class_star differences are less than 0.1 up to ks=18.0 .",
    "but , in the next bin ks@xmath40 , the class_star of the dimmed stars and galaxies could lead to some misclassification .",
    "nevertheless , as can be seen from the histogram in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : classstar1 ] , a non negligible number of objects start to populate the range from 0.4 to 0.8 in class_star at magnitudes fainter than 17 in ks , and the selection of the class_star cut off might bias the star counts estimates .    an alternative way to perform the star /",

    "<S> the alhambra survey aims to cover 4 square degrees using a system of 20 contiguous , equal width , medium - band filters spanning the range 3500  @xmath0 to 9700  @xmath0 plus the standard jhks filters . </S>",
    "<S> here we analyze deep near - ir number counts of one of our fields ( alh08 ) for which we have a relatively large area ( 0.5 square degrees ) and faint photometry ( j=22.4 , h=21.3 and k=20.0 at the 50% of recovery efficiency for point - like sources ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the logarithmic gradient of the galaxy counts undergoes a distinct change to a flatter slope in each band : from 0.44 at @xmath1 $ ] to 0.34 at @xmath2 $ ] for the j band ; for the h band 0.46 at @xmath3 $ ] to 0.36 at @xmath4 $ ] , and in ks the change is from 0.53 in the range @xmath5 $ ] to 0.33 in the interval @xmath6 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> these observations together with faint optical counts are used to constrain models that include density and luminosity evolution of the local type - dependent luminosity functions . </S>",
    "<S> our models imply a decline in the space density of evolved early - type galaxies with increasing redshift , such that only 30@xmath7 - 50@xmath7 of the bulk of the present day red - ellipticals was already in place at @xmath8 . </S>"
