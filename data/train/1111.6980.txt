    "the radiative cooling efficiencies of hot ( @xmath4  k ) low density gas are important quantities in the study of the diffuse interstellar and intergalactic medium .",
    "they determine the thermal and dynamical properties and evolution in a variety of astrophysical systems , ranging from local interstellar clouds to shocks in intergalactic filaments .",
    "computations of hot gas cooling efficiencies assuming collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) have been studied extensively ( house  1964 ; tucker & gould  1966 ; allen & dupree  1969 ; cox & tucker  1969 ; jordan  1969 ; raymond et al .",
    "1976 ; shull & van steenberg  1982 ; gaetz & salpeter  1983 ; arnaud & rothenflug  1985 ; boehringer & hensler  1989 ; sutherland & dopita  1993 ; landi & landini  1999 ; benjamin et al .",
    "these cie cooling efficiencies depend only on the gas temperature and metallicity . however , there are many cases in which cie conditions do not apply . for example , nonequilibrium ionization is bound to occur when an initially hot gas cools radiatively below @xmath5  k ( kafatos  1973 ; shapiro & moore  1976 ; edgar & chevalier  1986 ; schmutzler & tscharnuter  1993 ; sutherland & dopita  1993 , and smith et al .",
    "1996 ; gnat & sternberg  2007 ) .",
    "below this temperature , cooling becomes rapid compared to electron - ion recombinations , and the gas at any temperature tends to remain `` overionized''compared to gas in cie . in conduction fronts surrounding evaporating clouds ( e.g. ,  borkowski et al .",
    "1990 ; gnat et al .",
    "2010 ) , non - equilibrium ionization occurs when the ionization time is long compared to the rate of temperature change . in this case , the gas tends to remain underionized compared to cie .",
    "non - equilibrium ionization also plays a role in fast radiative shock waves ( e.g. ,  allen et al .",
    "2009 ; gnat & sternberg  2009 ) and in turbulent mixing layers ( e.g. ,  slavin et al .",
    "1993 ) .    when departures from cie are significant , the cooling efficiencies are no longer a function of just the gas temperature and metallicity , but instead depend on the specific time - dependent ion fractions .",
    "the use of convenient tables with known cie cooling efficiencies must be replaced with a detailed computation of the non - equilibrium cooling , taking into account all the relevant microphysical processes which include numerous emission lines , thermal bremsstrahlung , and ionization and recombination cooling .",
    "this both requires the collection of a large set of atomic data for all the relevant processes , and is computationally complex compared with using look - up tables .",
    "recently , first attempts have been made at including nonequilibrium ionization physics in large scale hydrodynamical simulations , with applications for both cosmological metal - absorption through the warm / hot intergalactic medium ( e.g. ,  cen & ostriker  2006 ; cen & fang  2006 ) and emission - lines from galaxy clusters ( e.g. ,  akahori & yoshikawa  2010 ) .",
    "because of the complexity of nonequilibrium cooling , such simulation have so far not included self - consistent nonequilibrium cooling efficiencies .",
    "it is simpler to include nonequilibrium cooling in hydrodynamical simulations by using look - up tables for the nonequilibrium cooling rate ( e.g. ,  oppenheimer & dav  2009 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present ion - by - ion cooling efficiencies .",
    "we list the cooling efficiencies for each ion of the first @xmath0 elements ( h@xmath1zn ) individually .",
    "we present results for gas temperatures between @xmath2 and @xmath3  k , assuming optically - thin , low - density conditions .",
    "the sum of ionic cooling efficiencies , weighted by the nonequilibrium ion - densities , then provides an efficient - to - compute and self - consistent nonequilibrium cooling efficiency .",
    "we also list the elemental cooling efficiencies assuming cie conditions . these can be used to construct cie cooling efficiencies for non - solar abundance ratios , or to estimate the remaining cooling due to elements not included in any time - dependent computation .",
    "this paper is _ not _ a new calculation of the cooling functions ( c.f .",
    "schure et al .",
    "we do not present any new atomic data .",
    "instead , we list the current cooling functions included in cloudy ( ver .",
    "08.00 ) in convenient online tables that are useful in any numerical computation in which the ion abundances are not in photoionization or collisional equilibrium .",
    "it is the first time that the individual ionic cooling efficiencies are listed in an accessible format .",
    "as we describe below , the new framework that we present here will be periodically maintained and updated , as improved atomic data becomes available .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section  2",
    ", we describe the computational method . in section  3",
    ", we present the results for the ion - by - ion cooling efficiencies , and for the element - by - element cie cooling efficiencies .",
    "we summarize in section  4 .",
    "we used cloudy ( ver .",

    "the electron cooling efficiency includes the removal of electron _",
    "kinetic _ energy via recombinations with ions , collisional ionizations , collisional excitations followed by prompt line emissions , and thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "cloudy does not include the ionization potential energies as part of the total internal energy , but instead follows the loss and gain of the electron kinetic energy only .",
    "therefore , in the definition of the cooling ( see osterbrock & ferland 2006 ; gnat & sternberg 2007 ) the ionization potential energy that is released as recombination radiation does not appear .",
    "only the kinetic energy of the recombining electrons contributes to the cooling efficiency . on the other hand , kinetic energy removed via collisional ionization",
    "is included in the cooling .",
    "if ionization potential energy is considered as part of the total internal energy , then collisional ionization does not lead to a net energy loss , since the kinetic energy removed is merely stored as potential energy .",
    "either way of accounting for the energy losses leads to the same _ net _",

    "these models yield the total cooling efficiency due to the cie ion distribution of element @xmath7 .",
    "the tables presented in this paper provide easy access to different components of the total cooling function computed in version 08.00 of cloudy .",
