    "understanding physical aging in glasses is essential at a technological level , for controlling the material properties and their temporal evolution , as well as at a fundamental level , since glasses are often considered as archetypes for systems far from thermodynamical equilibrium @xcite .",
    "however , and despite the strong efforts done in the field , a complete picture of the dynamics in the glassy state is still missing .",
    "the main difficulty arises from the complexity of the glassy properties .",
    "when a supercooled liquid is cooled below its glass transition temperature , @xmath3 , the system falls out of equilibrium in a metastable state which depends on the previous thermal history , and which evolves , with waiting time , through different states toward the corresponding supercooled equilibrium liquid phase .",
    "the existence of a multitude of different metastable glassy states which can be explored through different annealing procedures or cooling rates , makes difficult the development of a universal theory for glasses or even a plain comparison between different experimental results .",
    "+ physical aging in polymeric , metallic or more conventional inorganic glasses , is commonly studied by looking at the temporal evolution of a given observable , keeping fixed other external parameters , such as the temperature and the pressure of the system .",
    "macroscopic quantities like viscosity , refractive index , volume or elastic constants , are usually the subject of this kind of studies @xcite . in these works ,",
    "the investigated quantities evolve with waiting time , @xmath4 , in a way which depends on the previous thermal history and which can be accurately described by stretched exponential functions @xcite .",
    "similar results have been reported also in studies of aging effect on the intensity of the high frequency tail of the dielectric spectra @xcite .",
    "all these works provide information on the equilibration toward the supercooled liquid phase , but they do not give any microscopic details on the aging dynamics in the glassy state .",
    "this information can instead be obtained by the investigation , on a microscopic scale , of the temporal evolution of the structural relaxation time , @xmath5 , which represents the time necessary for the system to rearrange its structure toward a more stable configuration .",
    "its value can be measured , for instance , by monitoring the long time decay of the intermediate scattering function , @xmath6 , on a length scale @xmath7 , with the wave - vector @xmath8 corresponding to the mean inter particle distance .",
    "the intermediate scattering function is related to the density - density correlation function and contains all the information on the relaxation dynamics in the system on a length scale determined by @xmath8 . while the dynamics in the supercooled liquid phase has been widely investigated in the past , the difficulty of probing the particle - level dynamics in realistic molecular glasses both with experiments and simulations has instead strongly delayed progress in the field .",
    "in fact only very few studies exist of the behavior of @xmath5 below @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations on a lennard jones glass show that for small quenching from an equilibrium configuration , @xmath5 slows down linearly or sub linearly with waiting time @xcite in agreement with previous results on polymeric glasses @xcite .",
    "in addition , the long time decay of the correlation functions can be rescaled into a single master curve , leading to the validity of a time - waiting time superposition principle in the glassy state @xcite .",
    "+ recently , the aging of a mg@xmath9cu@xmath10y@xmath11 metallic glass has been studied in both the supercooled liquid phase and the glassy state by looking directly at the evolution of the dynamics at the interatomic length scale @xcite .",
    "the glass transition has been found to be accompanied by i ) a crossover of the intermediate scattering function from the well characterized stretched exponential shape - thus described by a stretching exponent @xmath12 - in the supercooled liquid phase , to an unusual compressed exponential form - defined by a parameter @xmath13 - in the glassy state and ii ) to the presence of two very distinct aging regimes below @xmath3 . in particular , a fast , exponential growth of @xmath5 has been reported for short waiting times , followed by an extremely slow aging regime at larger @xmath4 . while the latter slow regime has been already reported both in numerical simulations @xcite and in experiments on polymeric glasses @xcite , the compressed shape of the correlation functions and the fast aging regime had not been reported before in structural glasses .",
    "two similar aging regimes have been recently observed in a numerical study of a concentrated system of nearly hard spheres @xcite . in this case , however , the correlation functions display a more stretched exponential behavior , and no signature of a compressed shape was reported @xcite .",
    "+ compressed correlation functions and different aging regimes have instead been reported for out of equilibrium soft materials , where the dynamics is controlled more by ballistic - like rather than by diffusive motions @xcite .",
    "the previous work on the metallic glass thus suggests a common nature of the dynamics in metallic glasses and soft materials .",
    "a very similar faster than exponential decay and strong aging behavior for the intermediate scattering function has been observed also in a zr - based metallic glass by leitner and coworkers @xcite . in this case , however , this unusual dynamics has been associated with the onset of a crystallization process .",
    "there are consequently several questions to clarify : i ) are the results found in mg@xmath9cu@xmath10y@xmath11 really a universal feature of metallic glasses or do they depend on the microscopic details of the system ?",
    "ii ) is it possible to find a common description of physical aging for different glasses ?",
    "iii ) what is the effect played by the wave - vector , @xmath8 , on the dynamics ? + here , we answer to these questions by presenting a detailed investigation on physical aging in a zr@xmath0ni@xmath1 metallic glass at the atomic length scale . we find that in this case the dynamics in the glassy state is also characterized by compressed correlation functions and different aging regimes , supporting the idea of a universal mechanism for physical aging in metallic glasses .",
    "this hypothesis is moreover strengthened by the possibility of describing the aging dynamics using the same phenomenological exponential growth and rescaling the results obtained for different systems into a single master curve .",
    "the zr@xmath0ni@xmath1 samples ( @xmath14 k @xcite ) were produced as thin ribbons by melt - spinning at the polytechnic university of catalonia .",
    "the zr and ni pure metals were pre - alloyed by arc - melting under ti - gettered ar atmosphere .",
    "the melt was then fast - quenched with a cooling rate of @xmath15 k / s by injecting it on a cu wheel spinning with a 40 m/s perimeter velocity .",
    "the resulting metallic ribbons have a thickness of 22@xmath164 @xmath17 m , close to the optimal value required to maximize the scattered intensity in the experiments .",
    "the ribbons were then held in a resistively heated furnace covering a temperature range between 270 k and 1000 k with a thermal stability of less than 1 k. the temperature of the sample was held at @xmath18 k , reached by heating from room temperature with a fixed rate of @xmath19 k / min . +",
    "x - ray photon correlation spectroscopy ( xpcs ) measurements were carried out at the beamline id10 at the european synchrotron radiation facility in grenoble , france .",
    "an incident x - ray beam of 8.0 kev ( @xmath20 ) was selected by using a single bounce si(1,1,1 ) crystal monochromator with a bandwidth of @xmath21 .",
    "hard x - rays originating from higher order monochromator reflections were suppressed by a si mirror placed downstream of the monochromator .",
    "a partially coherent beam with @xmath22 photons / s was then obtained by rollerblade slits opened to @xmath23 @xmath17 m , placed @xmath240.18 m upstream of the sample . in order to enhance the scattered intensity ,",
    "speckle patterns were collected in transmission geometry by two ikonm charge - coupled devices from andor technology ( @xmath25 pixels , @xmath26 @xmath27 pixel size each one ) installed in the vertical scattering plane @xmath2470 cm downstream of the sample .",
    "all pixels of the two ccd detectors were considered to belong to the same @xmath8 with a resolution of @xmath28 @xmath29 .",
    "the detectors were mounted on a diffractometer and could rotate around the center of the sample position , covering a @xmath8 range up to several @xmath29 .",
    "xpcs measurements were performed for different wave - vectors at and around the first diffraction peak of the static structure factor which corresponds to @xmath30 @xmath29 , thereby probing directly the temporal relaxation of density fluctuations at the inter - particle distance @xmath31 .",
    "time series of up to @xmath245000 images were taken with 7 s exposure time per frame and were analyzed following the procedure described in ref .",
    "no beam damage was observed and the amorphous structure of the sample was checked during the whole experiment by measuring the corresponding static structure factor of the system .",
    "as previously discussed , physical aging implies a relaxation dynamics which is not the same at all times , but strongly depends on the sample age or waiting time .",
    "the temporal dependence of the dynamics can be entirely captured by xpcs through the determination of the two - time correlation function @xmath32 ( ttcf ) which represents the instantaneous correlation of the intensity @xmath33 at two times @xmath34 and @xmath35 , being : @xmath36 here , the average is performed on all the pixels of the ccd , that correspond to the same wave - vector @xmath8 @xcite .",

    "the width of this diagonal contour is instead proportional to the relaxation time @xmath5 .",
    "the steady slowing down of the dynamics , and thus the increase in the relaxation time due to physical aging , is illustrated by the broadening of the diagonal contour on increasing the sample age .",
    "this effect is clearly visible in the top panel of figure [ fig1 ] where we report data taken between @xmath41 and @xmath42 s after temperature equilibration . after almost 13 hours of annealing ( lower panel of figure [ fig1 ] ) ,",
    "the dynamics was so slow that the intensity along the diagonal covered almost the whole image , despite the time interval was almost the double with respect to the one reported in the top panel .",
    "after this very long annealing the width of the diagonal contour seems to be constant with time , as it would be in the case of stationary equilibrium dynamics . as discussed later , here the effect of physical aging",
    "is probably so slow that the dynamics appears as stationary at least on our experimental time scale .",
    "+ although the dynamics is not stationary , the aging is sufficiently slow that it is possible to find time intervals over which the @xmath32 can be averaged and thus to get the standard intensity autocorrelation function @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the temporal average over all the possible starting times @xmath34 .",
    "the intensity autocorrelation function is related to the intermediate scattering function through the siegert relation @xmath45 , with @xmath46 a setup - dependent parameter @xcite , and its determination allows capturing snapshots of the dynamics at different waiting times . the siegert relation requires the temporal average to be equal to the ensemble average .",

    "the data are reported together with the resulting fit obtained using equation .,width=9 ]    the intensity correlation functions decorrelate completely on the experimental time scale , implying that the system is able to rearrange its structure on the probed spatial length scale of few .",
    "the effect of aging is illustrated by the shift of the decay toward longer time scales upon increasing the sample age , in agreement with the analysis of the two times correlation functions reported in figure [ fig1 ] . as shown in figure [ fig2 ] , aging is so important that the decay time increases of almost a factor 10 in less than 13 hours .",
    "this fast aging is likely to be the reason of the well known rapid embrittlement of metallic glasses @xcite .",
    "+ interestingly , the correlation functions display a compressed , thus faster than exponential behavior , which can be well described by equation with a shape parameter @xmath57 , independent of the sample age .",
    "such a high value is in agreement with the results reported for other metallic glasses @xcite , while it can not be explained within the current theories for the dynamics in the glassy state @xcite .",
    "based on the observations of the dynamics in the liquid above the glass transition temperature , these theories predict a stretched , thus with @xmath58 , decay of the density fluctuations even in the glassy state .",
    "the idea is that the dynamic heterogeneities present in the liquid phase partially freeze below @xmath3 , leading to a narrower distribution of relaxation times , and thus to an increase of the shape exponent , up to the limiting case of @xmath59 .",
    "this explanation well describes the correlation functions calculated in numerical simulation @xcite and the increase of @xmath2 measured in some polymeric glasses @xcite , but can not take into account the behavior reported in figure [ fig2 ] .",

    "these values are however in perfect agreement with those reported for both the mg - based and zr - based metallic glasses @xcite and suggest the presence of a peculiar dynamical behavior at the atomic length scale .",
    "hence , it would be interesting to investigate the nature of the atomic dynamics in the glassy state through the @xmath8 dependence of the structural relaxation time .",

    "the second aging regime was accompanied by a decrease in the shape parameter .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig4 ] c ) , in the present case the lack of a full complete decay of @xmath67 for the highest @xmath4 leads to a larger error in the determination of @xmath2 , which can be determined only for @xmath68 s and remains however similar to the value obtained at lower @xmath4 .",
    "+ from the energetic point of view , the abrupt crossover to an almost stationary dynamics suggests the existence of a deep energy minimum in the potential energy landscape , where the system remains trapped for a very long time before eventually jumping into a different configuration @xcite .",
    "a similar plateau has been recently observed in the enthalpy recovery of glassy polymers and has been interpreted as a thermodynamically stable state @xcite .",
    "this explanation can not be extended to the case of metallic glasses .",
    "in fact , the comparison between xpcs and low temperature equilibrium viscosity data for mg@xmath9cu@xmath10y@xmath11 suggests instead a gradual approach toward equilibrium @xcite , in agreement with the sub linear aging regime found in other polymeric glasses and colloids @xcite . + following the procedure reported in ref .",
