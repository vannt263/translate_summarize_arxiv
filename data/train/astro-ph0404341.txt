    "in december 2003 , we proposed for and were awarded exploratory time to observe the spectacular double - pulsar system psr  j0737@xmath03039 ( hereafter 0737 ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and contributions to this volume from burgay , manchester , kramer , and others ) as part of the nrao rapid response science program .",
    "we observed 0737 five times at four different frequencies ( 427 , 2@xmath1820 , 1400 , and 2200mhz ) using the berkeley - caltech pulsar machine ( bcpm ) and the green bank pulsar processor ( gbpp ; which measures full polarization information ) . for two of the observations ( one each at 427 and 820 mhz ) we also used the new gbt spectrometer spigot card ( a correlator - based instrument that outputs lags at 25mb / s ) in some of its first scientific observations .",
    "these data are public and can be obtained from nrao .",
    "the high sensitivity of the gbt allowed us to measure high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) pulse profiles from psr  j0737@xmath03039a ( hereafter , see fig .",

    "the errors for @xmath7 and @xmath11 were estimated using a bootstrap analysis .",
    "we note that we had to fit out apparent linear arrival time drifts of order tens of @xmath3s during each of the observations .",
    "we believe that these ( likely ) systematic drifts could result from uncorrected variations in the linearly polarized portion of the pulse profile due to the rotation of the receiver feed with respect to the sky and gain differences between the two orthogonally polarized ifs .",

    ", we determined a set of 29 template profiles ( all referenced to the same gaussian component ) as a function of the orbital phase ( since s pulse profile changes systematically throughout the orbit ) and extracted toas from each of the bcpm observations . using the @xcite timing solution as a starting point , we used tempo to fit only for @xmath12 and the local spin frequency .",
    "the post - fit residuals show significant systematics as a function of orbital phase ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : btiming ] ) , implying that there may be no stable timing reference point in the varying profile ( i.e. s wind likely affects the radio beam of  as a function of orbital phase ) . if we multiply tempo s formal errors on @xmath12 by 10.3 ( the square - root of the reduced-@xmath13 of the fit ) to try and account for some of these systematics , we get @xmath12=1.5126(14)lt - sec and a mass ratio @xmath14 , which is a factor of @xmath46 more precise than reported in @xcite . a @xmath15 vs. @xmath16 diagram based on the gbt data but using the reported value of @xmath17 from @xcite is shown in fig .",

    "the gbpp coherently dedisperses and folds full - stokes data on a single pulsar in real time .",
    "the most useful polarimetric data sets were those taken at 820mhz :  on 2003 dec 19 and  on 2003 dec 24 .",
    "we used the full track on  to perform polarization self calibration of the data .",
    "this calibration fit included terms accounting for channel gain difference , feed cross coupling , feed ellipticity , and cable delays .",
    "the rms average of all such off - diagonal mueller matrix elements was 0.085 , so we are confident that our calibration is fairly good .",
    "we also used measurements of the observatory correlated noise source and observations of psr  b1929@xmath1810 to confirm our calibration .",
    "[ fig : polarization ] shows the 820mhz gbpp observations of  and the mirror - like symmetry of the pulse profile .",
    "we have chosen longitude @xmath19 as the center of this symmetry , which is visible in both the total power and linearly polarized profiles . also shown is the position angle versus pulse longitude for points having @xmath204@xmath21 significance .",
    "the longitude region @xmath22 appears to contain an orthogonal emission mode jump .",
    "the region @xmath23 may also be affected by quasi - orthogonal modes .",
    "we find the rotation measure of this pulsar to be @xmath24radm@xmath25 .",
    "the mirror symmetry of the profile suggests that the emission is coming from two traversals of a wide , hollow emission cone , rather than from two opposite magnetic poles .",
    "we have performed a rotating vector model ( rvm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) fit to the data which seems to support this interpretation .",
    "the fit gives values for the angle between the magnetic and rotation axes ( @xmath26 ) and the closest angle between the magnetic axis and the line of sight ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "we can also calculate the cone opening half - angle @xmath28 , using the longitude separation of the two peaks .",
    "the fit produces two solutions , one with @xmath29 and one with @xmath30 .",
    "the large-@xmath26 solution requires a extremely large opening angle , @xmath31 .",
    "we favor the small-@xmath26 solution , as it is more consistent with the mirror symmetry , and permits more modest values of @xmath28 . in this solution",

    "the polarimetric properties of  are also interesting , though less easily understood .",
    "in addition to showing a remarkable intensity variation throughout its orbit , this pulsar shows variation in its degree of linear polarization . the brightest `` window '' ( i ) , just before conjunction , shows a peak linear polarization fraction of @xmath414% .",
    "however , in the next bright window ( ii ) , just after conjunction , the pulse is almost completely unpolarized ( @xmath21% ) . from window i",

    "we folded data obtained within 2min of s superior conjunction in 2-s intervals using 256 phase bins and then cross - correlated each profile with a template .",
    "the cross - correlation , done in the fourier domain , assumes the data profile @xmath34 has the form @xmath35 for @xmath36 , and where @xmath37 is the template , @xmath38 is a scale factor , @xmath39 is the noise background , and @xmath40 is a temporal offset .",
    "values of @xmath41 , @xmath38 and @xmath40 were adjusted iteratively to minimize a @xmath13 fit to each profile @xcite .",
    "we used the scale factor @xmath38 and its standard deviation as a relative measure of the pulsar s flux and its uncertainty , respectively .",
    "our resulting eclipse light curves at three radio frequencies are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : eclipses ] .",
    "the eclipse properties are remarkably independent of frequency , as previously noted qualitatively by @xcite . because of its largely achromatic properties",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : eclipses]d an eclipse light curve obtained by averaging those in panels a , b , and c. a striking eclipse property is that it is asymmetric at all frequencies in a similar way .",
    "the eclipse ingress is clearly longer in duration than the egress .    to quantify some of these properties",
    ", we fit the light curves with two functions of the form @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the flux at orbital phase @xmath44 , defined such that superior conjunction is at @xmath45 .",
    "the best fits are shown as solid curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : eclipses ] and all yield values of reduced-@xmath13 near unity . using the fit parameters ,",
    "we quantitatively show that the eclipse duration is independent of frequency with a limit on a power - law index of @xmath40.5 ; that the ingress takes @xmath43 times longer than egress , and that the eclipse very likely lasts longer post - conjunction .",
    "there is a hint that the eclipse asymmetry grows with increasing radio frequency , but this is not statistically significant .    a possible model for the  eclipse",
    "is presented in these proceedings by arons et al .",
    "( see also arons et al . in prep ) .",
    "s wind likely confines s magnetosphere on the side facing , causing it to resemble a time - dependent variant of the earth s magnetosphere .",
    "synchrotron absorption in a shock heated `` magnetosheath '' surrounding and containing s magnetosphere is then responsible for the eclipse .",
    "additional details on the data analysis and the eclipse model can be found in @xcite .",
    "the high snr of the gbt data at 1400mhz and the fantastic frequency resolution of the spigot at 820mhz allowed us to make `` self - calibrating '' measurements of the orbital variation of the diffractive scintillation timescale @xmath46 for  and hence , the so - called scintillation velocity @xmath47 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "closely following the methodology of @xcite , we computed dynamic spectra for  for the two observations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : scint ] ) , and then using the known ( from timing ) orbital motion of , fit a model consisting of four parameters : the orbital inclination @xmath9 , the systemic velocity parallel- ( @xmath48 ) and perpendicular - to ( @xmath49 ) the line of nodes on the sky , and the scaling parameter @xmath50 .",
    "our results indicate that 0737 is moving across the sky at @xmath51@xmath52140.9@xmath536.2kms@xmath54 , with component veocities of @xmath48@xmath5296.0@xmath533.7kms@xmath54 and @xmath55@xmath52103.1@xmath537.7kms@xmath54 .",
    "when combined with the timing fits described in  [ sec : timing ] , the best - fit inclination is @xmath56 .    using a simple kinematic argument and estimates of the characteristics of 0737 before the second supernova @xcite , the large @xmath49 implies that  was born with a kick speed of @xmath57100kms@xmath54 .",
    "future measurements of the scintillation velocity should allow us to remove the contaminating effects of the earth s motion around the sun and the differential rotation of the galaxy .",
    "a precise systemic velocity in combination with a vlba - determined proper motion will provide an accurate geometric distance to the system ( which could be crucial for high precision tests of gravitational theories ; see the contribution by kramer in this volume ) .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "due to the superior sensitivity of the gbt , we detected  at good signal - to - noise levels almost throughout the orbit .",
    "[ fig : lightcurve ] shows the normalized flux received from   as a function of the true anomaly ( referenced from the line of nodes ) @xmath58 , at 820- ( filled circles ) and 1400-mhz ( open circles ) .",
    "the light curve shows significant systematic variation , as first shown by @xcite , and four prominent phase windows where the pulsar is bright ( indicated by i , ii , iii & iv ; see also fig .",
    "[ fig : btiming ] ) . in the range of @xmath59 to @xmath60",
    ", the pulsar appears to exhibit what may be interpreted as an eclipse , where we did not detect any signal within our sensitivity limits .",
    "in fact , around the eclipse boundary , the reduction in snr was so significant that the pulsar became undetectable within a few rotation periods of .",
    "the arons et al .  magnetopause model ( these proceedings ; 2004 , in prep ) may be able to explain at least some of s systematic flux variation ( including the eclipse ) , as well as s eclipse .",

    "the measured modulation index @xmath61 at 820mhz as a function of pulse longitude for  is in the range 0.6@xmath02.0 .",
    "s profile structure is much more complex , where even the average profile changes systematically as a function of @xmath58 ( as first discussed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , presumably indicating a change in the emission beam morphology . in windows",
    "i and ii , values of @xmath61 are in the range 1@xmath01.5 and 1@xmath02 , respectively .",
    "these values are significantly greater than what is expected from interstellar scattering ( @xmath47% ) , given the measured frequency and temporal dimensions of scintles and their filling factor @xcite .",
    "the spectral shape of these intrinsic fluctuations are `` noiselike '' ( i.e. white ) , indicating the lack of any organized drifting patterns .",
    "we present a much more detailed study of the above mentioned properties in @xcite .",
    "the fantastic and highly - varied science to come from these five observations gives some indication of how important a role the gbt will play in future work on 0737 .",
    "these observations provide the best constraints yet available on the inclination of the orbits , the mass ratio of the pulsars , the geometry of s radio emission , the asymmetries and achromaticity of s eclipses ( and the nature of s magnetosphere that cause them ) , the orbital modulation of s pulsed flux , and the systemic velocity of 0737 and the kick that caused it .    the high gain of the telescope",
