    "a key parameter in the standard adiabatic cold - dark matter - based models of structure formation is the amplitude that fluctuations in the gravitational potential have when they enter the horizon .",
    "this number , which we will denote @xmath3 , has been measured by the cobe satellite to be of order @xmath8 ( smoot 1992 ; bennett 1996 ) , and is assumed to be virtually independent of scale in the most popular models .",
    "why @xmath8 ?",
    "the answers proposed by theorists fall into two categories :    1 .",
    "@xmath0 can be computed from first principles using some ( still undiscovered ) fundamental theory .",
    "@xmath0 can not be computed from first principles , since the correct fundamental theory merely predicts an ensemble of superhorizon - sized spatial regions with a wide range of @xmath3 , forcing us to treat @xmath3 as random number subject to various anthropic selection effects .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to consider such selection effects , by studying how the physical processes of structure formation depend on @xmath3 .",
    "our motivation for this is threefold :    1 .",
    "it affects which inflation / defect models should be considered natural as opposed to fine tuned .",
    "2 .   it is related to a crucial loophole in the recent arguments for an anthropic upper bound on @xmath4 .",
    "it poses useful test problems for comparing cosmological simulations .",
    "the structure of our universe is fixed by a rather small number of physical parameters .",
    "the electron mass , the neutron mass and the low energy coupling constants of the four basic forces determine the physical properties of most objects on scales ranging from the atomic to the galactic ( see carr & rees 1979 ; davies 1982 ; barrow & tipler 1986 ) , and these parameters can in turn be computed from the roughly 20 free parameters of the standard model of particle physics . a number of additional parameters are often thought of as initial data laid down in the early universe : the baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath9 , the relative abundances of various dark - matter candidates , the vacuum density @xmath10 contributed by a cosmological constant @xmath4 , the spatial curvature ( related to @xmath5 ) and the amplitude @xmath3 of cosmological density fluctuations , although it is not implausible that abundances such as @xmath9 can ultimately be derived from other particle physics constants . together with the basic laws , these parameters determine when cosmic structures first emerge and how they evolve .",
    "although the detailed outcome in any one locality , and what complex systems evolve there , depends on local accidents , these parameters nonetheless determine the statistical properties .",
    "will it ever be possible to compute the values of all these parameters from first principles , within the framework of some yet to be discovered fundamental theory ?",
    "the answer is a resounding no within some variants of inflationary cosmology ( , linde 1983 , 1987 , 1990 , 1995 ; linde & zelnikov 1988 ; coleman 1988 ; albrecht 1994 ; vilenkin 1995abcd ; vilenkin & winitzki 1997 ) , where the spatial region that we conventionally call `` our universe '' , itself perhaps extending far beyond the present observational horizon , is just one element in an ensemble whose members have widely disparate properties .",
    "some physical parameters may take a range of different values throughout this ensemble of exponentially large and causally disconnected regions .",
    "the predictions of such theories therefore take the form of probability distributions for the parameters in question , and these must be computed in bayesian fashion taking into account the selection effect that observers are not equally likely to inhabit all parts of the ensemble . for instance , just as we expect low surface brightness galaxies to be underrepresented in many surveys , we might expect o - stars to be underrepresented in solar systems containing planet - based extraterrestrial civilizations and , as we shall see , spacetime regions with @xmath11 to be underrepresented in the set of regions that contain observers .",
    "the importance of such anthropic selection effects was stressed by carter ( 1974 ) , and is discussed in great detail in books by , , davies ( 1982 ) and barrow & tipler ( 1986 ) .",
    "more recent reviews can be found in , , balashov ( 1991 ) and tegmark ( 1997 ) .",
    "many inflationary models predict an ensemble of exponentially large space - time regions , each with a different value of @xmath3 ( see linde 1990 ; vilenkin 1995abcd and references therein ) .",
    "although the cosmological literature abounds with remarks on the `` unnaturally '' flat potential required to produce @xmath0 in our own hubble volume , often as a motivation to study defect models , one can just as well argue that it is unnatural that the potential is not even flatter , since superflat potentials make inflation last longer and hence dominate the ensemble by volume ( vilenkin 1995a ) .",
    "this dispute can not be resolved without taking the inevitable anthropic selection effects into account : if these turn out to place a firm _ upper _ limit on @xmath3 near the observed value , then inflation models predicting ensembles peaked at _ high _ @xmath3 clearly require no fine tuning to explain why we observe @xmath0 .",
    "conversely , if these selection effects give a firm lower limit on @xmath3 near @xmath8 , then inflation models predicting ensembles peaked at low @xmath3 require no fine tuning .",
    "another hotly debated parameter is @xmath4 , the cosmological constant .",
    "although one might expect the most `` natural '' value of the vacuum density @xmath10 to be of order the planck density , the observational upper limits on @xmath12 are a striking factor of @xmath13 smaller .",
    "this has led to fine tuning criticism of cosmological models with @xmath14 , the argument being that they were ruled out at high confidence , since such a small value of @xmath4 was extremely unlikely ( see dolgov 1997 for an up - to - date review ) . as was pointed out by barrow & tipler ( 1986 ) , weinberg ( 1987 , 1989 ) and efstathiou ( 1995 )",
    ", there is a flaw in this argument , since it neglects a powerful anthropic selection effect .",
    "if @xmath4 is too large , then the universe becomes vacuum dominated before the density fluctuations have grown enough to form non - linear structures . hence the fluctuations stop growing , and neither galaxies nor observers will ever form .",
    "it is therefore no surprise that we find ourselves in a region where @xmath4 is small .",
    "a calculation of the probability distribution for @xmath10 given our existence shows that values of order of the current limits are in fact rather typical ( efstathiou 1995 ) , and more accurate calculations ( weinberg 1996 ; martel 1997 ) have confirmed this conclusion .",
    "unfortunately , there is a loophole in this argument ( rees 1997 ) . as described in more detail in section 5 ,",
    "increasing @xmath4 by some factor @xmath15 can be completely offset by increasing @xmath3 by a factor @xmath16 as far as this argument is concerned . whether this is really",
    "a loophole thus depends crucially on the topic of the present paper , specifically on whether observers could exist if @xmath17 . the analogous potential loophole exists for anthropic lower bounds on @xmath5 ( barrow 1982 ; vilenkin & winitzki 1997 ) .",
    "a third and entirely different motivation for exploring counterfactual values of parameters such as @xmath3 is that it provides a challenging and bias - free test of cosmological simulation techniques .",
    "state - of the art simulations including hydrodynamics ( which breaks the degeneracy between @xmath3 and @xmath18 in pure gravity simulations ) , gas chemistry and star formation often achieve a good fit to our actual universe ( see kang 1994 and references therein ) , but only after tweaking a number of parameters empirically . it is therefore unclear to what extent the agreement between different groups is due to realistic modeling as opposed to simply living in ( and parameter - fitting to ) the same universe",
    ". it would be far more convincing if two groups could obtain indistinguishable results for hypothetical universes with other values of @xmath3 , where the answer would not be known beforehand .",
    "in section 2 , we outline how @xmath3 affects structure formation in a universe with @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we discuss the effects of lowering and raising @xmath3 in sections 3 and 4 , respectively , and the effects of changing @xmath5 and @xmath4 in section  5 .",
    "we will find it convenient to work in planck units where @xmath21 , and the fundamental units of of length , time , mass and temperature are @xmath22 m , @xmath23s , @xmath24 kg and @xmath25k , respectively .",
    "important dimensionless constants that will recur frequently are the electromagnetic coupling constant @xmath26 , the gravitational coupling constant @xmath27 , the electron - proton mass - ratio @xmath28 , the baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath29 , the baryon fraction @xmath30 of the nonrelativistic matter density ( which we take to equal the critical value that gives a spatially flat universe ) and the matter - to - photon ratio = _",
    "g^1/2_b ~10 ^ -27 .",
    "this constant @xmath31 is simply the amount of nonrelativistic matter per photon , @xmath32 , measured in planck masses .",
    "as our goal is to highlight the main physical effects rather than to make detailed numerical calculations , we will frequently use the symbol @xmath33 , which we take to mean that numerical factors of other unity ( @xmath34 and the like ) have been omitted .",
    "for instance , the hydrogen binding energy ( 1 rydberg ) , the bohr radius and the thomson cross section are given by @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .    the reader may find it unfamiliar to see almost no reference below to familiar quantities such as the redshift @xmath38 , the current cmb temperature @xmath39 , the current hubble constant @xmath40 and the current density parameter @xmath41 .",
    "this is because we strive to highlight how structure formation depends on fundamental parameters , and these quantities are not fundamental since they have meaning only once the epoch at which we happen to be living has been specified .",
    "indeed , for the the open universe case , @xmath42 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 can be thought of as merely alternative time variables , since they all decrease monotonically with @xmath18 .",
    "for instance , we are not interested in examining what @xmath3-values allow galaxies to form by the present epoch @xmath43 years , but what @xmath3-values allow them to form at all .      the rising curves in show when different mass scales go nonlinear , defined as the time when linear perturbation theory predicts an overdensity of 1.69 in a top hat sphere containing the mass @xmath44 ( press & schechter 1974 ) .",
    "the curves were computed for the cold dark matter ( cdm ) power spectrum fit of bond & efstathiou ( 1984 ) with @xmath45 , `` shape parameter '' @xmath46 , and an @xmath47 normalization @xmath48 .",
    "we assume a standard spatially flat universe ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) everywhere in this paper , thus requiring more than a single number for their parametrization . ] except in .",
    "since fluctuations can not grow before the matter - radiation equality epoch , the radiation energy per proton , @xmath49 , equals the dark matter energy per proton , @xmath50 , so @xmath51 . since the energy density is @xmath52 , the friedman equation gives the hubble expansion rate @xmath53 , and so the age of universe at this time is @xmath54 . ]",
    "@xmath55s ( the vertical line in the figure ) , all scales below the horizon mass at this epoch , m_eq~_eq",
    "t_eq^3~^-2 ~_g^-2~10 ^ 16 , have similar fluctuation levels , and are seen to virialize roughly simultaneously ( up to a logarithmic factor ) , at ~t_eq q^-3/2~^-2q^-3/2 .",
    "( the origin of the `` @xmath56 '' is that , during the matter - dominated epoch , fluctuations grow as the scale factor @xmath57 and @xmath58 . )",
    "since the figure shows that the actual curves approach vertical only for very small mass scales , we have included a factor @xmath59 in which depends weakly on mass .",
    "@xmath60 for @xmath61 , with the value for typical galactic scales @xmath62 being @xmath63 .",
    "far above this mass scale , @xmath64 ( we assume the standard spectral index @xmath65 ) , which means that @xmath66 , where the horizon mass is @xmath67 ( straight solid line ) .",
    "thus the curves all have the same shape , and their left and right asymptotes lie about a factor @xmath68 to the right of the two heavy straight lines in the figure , giving the following broad - brush picture .",
    "mass scales @xmath69 virialize roughly simultaneously , at @xmath70 .",
    "as time progresses , ever larger scales keep virializing , the non - linear mass scale always being a fraction @xmath71 of the horizon mass scale ( a fraction @xmath72 in radius ) .",
    "note that the the number @xmath73 occurring in this crucial mass @xmath74 is simply @xmath75  the well - known result that a stellar mass @xmath76 ( dyson 1971 ) was used in .",
    "when an overdensity has collapsed , the resulting virial halo will have a typical density that exceeds the background density by a collapse factor @xmath77 , , _ vir~_eq(t_virt_eq)^-2~^4 ^-2q^3 . for a cdm halo of mass @xmath44",
    ", this corresponds to a characteristic size @xmath78 , velocity @xmath79 and virial temperature t_vir~m_p v_vir^2 ~_g^1/2 ^4/3 ^-2/3 ^ 1/3 m^2/3 q. a number of isotherms are plotted in , and we see that as time progresses and ever larger halos form , the virial temperature stops increasing around the characteristic time @xmath80 and approaches a maximum value @xmath81 , corresponding to a maximum virial velocity @xmath82 .",
    "thus for our @xmath0 universe , typical cluster temperatures are @xmath83 , about @xmath8 times the proton rest energy , and characteristic cluster velocity dispersions are @xmath84 , about @xmath85 times the speed of light .",
    "this direct link between @xmath3 and halo temperatures immediately indicates why lowering @xmath3 can cause qualitatively different structure formation scenarios .",
    "unless @xmath87 exceeds typical atomic energy scales @xmath88 , which corresponds to q ~ m_e c^2 ^ 2m_p c^2 = ^2~10 ^ -8 , it will be difficult for the gas in these halos to dissipate their energy to collapse and form stars .",
    "hydrogen line cooling freezes out at about @xmath89 , for instance , corresponding to @xmath90 .",
    "we will now discuss cooling constraints in more detail , and see that these cause qualitative changes even for much smaller departures from @xmath0 .    the fate of the baryons in a virialized halo depends crucially on the ratio of the cooling timescale @xmath91 to the gravitational collapse timescale @xmath92 ( see binney 1977 , rees & ostriker 1977 ; silk 1977 ; white and rees 1978 ) . if @xmath44 and @xmath18 are such that @xmath93 ( the dark - shaded region in ) , the cloud can not promptly commence free - fall collapse and fragment into stars , but will remain pressure supported for at least a local hubble time . for the halo formation curve corresponding to @xmath0 ,",
    "the part of the @xmath94 curve setting the upper limit on galaxy mass is seen to have a logarithmic slope around @xmath95 ( because bremsstrahlung , with @xmath96 , is the dominant cooling process ) , corresponding to @xmath97 and a constant radius @xmath98 ( carr & rees 1979 ) .",
    "the corresponding mass scale is seen to be @xmath62 . for slightly lower",
    "@xmath3 , the upper limit is dominated by line cooling in neutral hydrogen ( rightmost bump ) , helium ( second bump ) and any heavier elements released by early stars ( not included here ) . the lower mass limit is set by the @xmath99 isotherm , below which there are essentially no free electrons and both line cooling and bremsstrahlung become ineffective .",
    "molecular cooling can potentially lower this mass limit slightly ( haiman 1996 ; abel 1997 ; gnedin & ostriker 1997 ; tegmark 1997 ) , but is ignored in the figure for the same reason as heavy elements : it is irrelevant to our @xmath3-constraints , which depend only how far the cooling region extents to the right , not on the vertical extent .    what happens if we start lowering @xmath3 ?",
    "the first change is that the upper limit becomes set not by bremsstrahlung but by line cooling .",
    "indicates that as we keep lowering @xmath3 , the range of galactic masses narrows down and finally vanishes completely for @xmath100 .",
    "let us express this critical value @xmath101 in fundamental constants .",

    "tells us that efficient cooling occurs when q^-1 ^ -16/9 _",
    "g^4/3 ^ -4/3 ^ 2/3_b^-2/3 ~10 ^ -6 .",
    "if @xmath112 , then what is the ultimate fate of the quasistatic pressure supported gas clouds ? it is plausible that they will become increasingly rarefied as their dark matter halos eventually merge into larger ( and less dense ) halos , thereby never entering a phase of runaway cooling , fragmentation and star formation .",
    "however , even in the arguably contrived case where such a cloud escaped any further collisions , and eventually managed to cool after a ( perhaps exponentially ) long time , perhaps through some exotic mechanism such as 21 cm cooling , and developed a dense , self - gravitating core which fragmented into stars , there would still be reason to doubt whether it could produce intelligent observers .",
    "since the binding energy of the halo is so low ( of order @xmath113 ) , the first supernova explosion might well eject all the gas from the halo , thereby precluding the production of population ii stars and planets containing heavy elements .",
    "what happens if we start increasing @xmath3 instead ?",
    "the allowed mass range for galaxies keeps broadening at a steady rate until compton cooling suddenly eliminates the upper mass limit altogether .",
    "this is because the time scale on which cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons at temperature @xmath114 cool an ionized plasma , _",
    "comp~^3 c^4 m_e_t(k t_)^4 x , is independent of both its density and temperature ( assuming that @xmath115 , so that @xmath116 ) .",

    ", we find that the upper limit to galaxy masses persists only for q^-4/5_g^3/5 ^ 6/5 ^ -4/5 ^ 2/3~10 ^ -4.5 . for larger @xmath3-values , all mass scales can cool efficiently , so the characteristic mass for the first generation of galaxies will simply be @xmath120 , given by .",

    "it would plainly need detailed simulations to determine the mix of discs and spheroids , and the effects of subsequent mergers .",
    "however , the galaxies could well have a broader luminosity function than in our actual universe ( as well as a much higher characteristic mass ) ; and clustering would also extend up to a larger fraction of the hubble radius .",
    "would this qualitative change affect the number of habitable planets produced ?",
    "let us first consider the stability of planetary orbits .",
    "lightman ( 1984 ) has shown that if the planetary surface temperature is to be compatible with organic life , the orbit around the central star should be fairly circular and have a radius of order r_au~^-5_g^-3/4 ^ -2~10 ^ 11 , roughly our terrestrial `` astronomical unit '' , precessing one radian in its orbit on a timescale",
    "t_orb~^-15/2_g^-5/8 ^ -3~0.1 .",
    "an encounter with another star with impact parameter @xmath123 has the potential to throw the planet into a highly eccentric orbit or even unbind it from its parent star .",
    "this happens on a timescale @xmath124 , where @xmath125 and @xmath126 denote the typical stellar density and stellar velocity in a galaxy , respectively .",
    "writing @xmath127 , where @xmath128 and @xmath129 is the additional factor by which the dissipating baryons collapse relative to the dark matter before fragmenting into stars , the milky way is empirically fit by @xmath130 . for earth , this gives @xmath131 , orders of magnitude above its present age .",
    "moreover , the distant encounters that we have experienced in the past have had a completely negligible effect since they were adiabatic .",
    "this means that the impact duration @xmath132 , so that the solar system returned to its unperturbed state once the encounter was over . for hypothetical galaxies forming before @xmath133 , on the other hand , @xmath61 ,",

    "non - adiabatic encounters are frequent events for @xmath2 , occurring often during the geological timescales required for a planet to form , cool and ultimately evolve life . in the conservative approximation of ignoring gravitational focusing ( assuming that the flyby speed @xmath136 exceeds the orbital speed ) , the typical time interval between @xmath137 encounters is _",

    "thus the white region in the figure disappears completely if @xmath188 , and the conservative limit @xmath189 gives the ( rather weak ) constraint @xmath190 .",
    "conversely , the planetary disruption constraint of gets stronger if we _ increase _",
    "@xmath31 , and conflicts with the @xmath31-independent limit of unless @xmath191 .",
    "in addition , there are of course separate limits on the baryon fraction @xmath192 , in that if there are too few baryons , the cooling becomes less efficient  see . lowering @xmath192",
    "may also impede galaxy and star formation , since a gas cloud must collapse by a larger factor before it becomes self - gravitating .    for the reader",
    "preferring to think in terms of @xmath41 and redshift @xmath38 , the above argument can be re - expressed as follows .",
    "if the current matter density is @xmath167 , then vacuum domination occurs at the epoch @xmath193 . if @xmath194 , then the universe became curvature dominated at a redshift given by @xmath195 . since the first structures form at an epoch @xmath196 ,",
    "the upper limits on @xmath4 and @xmath197 thus scale as @xmath198 and @xmath199 for the @xmath194 case .",
    "for instance , maintaining spatial flatness but making @xmath4 a million times larger than the current observational limits could correspond to @xmath200 , with galaxy formation about ten expansion times after recombination .",
    "when the universe had reached its current age of @xmath201 years , it would have expanded by a further factor @xmath202 , and ours would be the only galaxy in the local hubble volume  alas , a drab and dreary place for extragalactic astronomers , but not ruled out by the above - mentioned @xmath4-arguments alone  although perhaps by the @xmath3-arguments that we have presented .",
    "we have explored counterfactual cosmological scenarios with @xmath3 shifted away from its observed value @xmath203 .",
    "we found that qualitative changes occur if we either increase or decrease @xmath3 by about an order of magnitude .",
    "if @xmath1 , efficient cooling becomes impossible for gas in virialized halos .",
    "if @xmath2 , compton scattering against cmb photons enables efficient cooling in arbitrarily massive halos , and the higher stellar densities and velocities may lead to planetary orbits being disrupted before observers have had time to evolve .",
    "needless to say , this does not preclude that some form of life might evolve in a universe with a more extreme @xmath3-value due to lucky circumstances , for instance around a field star that was ejected from its giant host galaxy in a @xmath204 scenario .",
    "however , as stressed by vilenkin ( 1995a ) , the key feature of anthropic selection effects is not what the rock - solid extreme limits are on a parameter , but which is _ the most favorable value _ for producing observers .",
    "this point is also emphasized by garca - bellido & linde ( 1995 ) . to predict a probability distribution for the observed value of @xmath3 from some inflationary model ( to potentially rule the model out ) , its a priori probability distribution for @xmath3 ( of quantum origin , say ) must be multiplied by some bayesian selection function such as the number of observers or civilizations corresponding to each @xmath3-value .",
    "it seems plausible that much more stars with habitable planets are formed for @xmath0 ( where perhaps @xmath205 of all baryons are in stars ) than in a @xmath206 universe where 1000 times lower densities make cooling difficult .",
    "likewise , it appears likely that @xmath207 gives fewer planets in favorable stable orbits than @xmath0 , where close encounters are completely negligible for most stars . in conclusion , it is possible that the anthropic selection function peaks at @xmath0 .",
    "if this is the case , then what vilenkin terms `` the principle of mediocrity '' would imply that since we are most likely to be a typical civilization , this is what we should expect to observe .",
