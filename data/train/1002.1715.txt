    "_ transitional _ protoplanetary disks bridge the evolutionary gap between luminous optically - thick _ primordial _ disks of gas and small dust , which presumably have yet to make planet - mass bodies and gas - poor / free optically - thin _ debris _ disks , which have ended any gas giant planet formation @xcite .",
    "stars surrounded by transitional disks have near - to - mid ir dust emission intermediate between primordial disk - bearing stars and diskless photospheres , implying that much of their solid mass is in the process of being lost from the system and/or incorporated into large planetesimals / protoplanets .",
    "ground - based studies of transitional disks from ir to submm photometry find evidence for structural features in these disks , large inner holes / gaps in the disks dust distribution , indicative of active disk dispersal ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , transitional disks may provide valuable insights into how and when planet formation ends .    the unprecedented mid - ir sensitivity of the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "made spectroscopic observations of nearby transitional disks and photometry for many transitional disks beyond @xmath2 200400 pc accessible for the first time . in this contribution ,",
    "i summarize new spitzer results that clarify our understanding of morphologies and lifetimes of transitional disks .",
    "these results reveal two types of transitional disks , which may be evidence for a range of mechanisms responsible for dispersing disks and show that the transitional disk phase typically comprises an appreciable fraction of the total protoplanetary disk lifetime .",
    "furthermore , analyzing the accretion frequency / rate and submillimeter fluxes of transitional disks provides some insight into the processes that are plausibly responsible for transitional disk morphologies and thus potentially crucial for dispersing disks and shutting off planet formation .",
    "like primordial disks , transitional disks are considered to be a particular kind of `` first - generation '' , protoplanetary disk .",
    "unlike primordial disks , they show strong evidence of dust removal . while some early papers discussing transitional disks differed about how this dust removal proceeds(e.g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , pre - spitzer studies typically associated the term `` transitional disk '' with `` disks with inner holes '' .",
    "such disks show the most dramatic evidence for dust clearing , clearing in such disks could be confirmed by spatially - resolved imaging , and physical processes responsible for disk dispersal often lead to an inside - out clearing ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "new spitzer results better characterize the properties of transitional disks with inner holes and also find that transitional disks may also have a second morphology , exhibiting a more global or homologous depletion of dust .",
    "below , we describe properties of both transitional disk morphologies in more detail .    * * transitional disks with inner holes / gaps * have photospheric or weak , optically - thin 510 @xmath3 emission unlike primordial disks but have more optically - thick emission at longer wavelengths ( e.g. 1020 @xmath3 ) like primordial disks . because longer wavelength emission preferentially originates from colder , more distant regions of a disk , their seds provide evidence for a substantial depletion of warm dust with respect to their cold dust population .",
    "the strong radially - dependent clearing of dust in these disks implies an inside - out dispersal of dust . +",
    "the presence of an inner hole is consistent with sophisticated sed modeling of photometric and spectroscopic data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and confirmed by spatially - resolved submillimeter observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a slight variant on this morphology is a disk whose weak mid - ir emission provides evidence for large disk regions with optically - thin warm dust and an optically - thick outer disk made of cold dust but whose near - ir emission reveals optically - thick hot dust close to the star .",
    "the seds of these disks are then more consistent with a large gap instead of an inner hole extending to the stellar magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows the sed for a m2 star in ngc 2362 that has a transitional disk with a @xmath4 4 au inner hole @xcite .",
    "+ typical inner hole sizes inferred from sed modeling of spitzer irs spectra range from @xmath2 4 au to @xmath2 60 au ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "broadband ir photometry alone may identify transitional disks with large inner holes / gaps around solar - mass stars , where the star - to - disk contrast is good @xcite .",
    "the ir fluxes for other transitional disks with inner holes / gaps can be very similar to those for primordial disks ( e.g. sz cha , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "moreover , even spitzer irs spectroscopy may fail to distinguish between primordial disks and transitional disks with smaller , @xmath2 au - scale cleared regions , especially if they also have optically - thick near - ir emission ( c. espaillat , pvt .",
    "thus , many transitional disks with smaller holes / gaps probably have yet to be discovered .",
    "analysis of these systems would probe the earliest stages in inside - out disk clearing . * * homologously depleted transitional disks * lack evidence for a strong radially - dependent depletion of dust and , therefore , an inner hole .",
    "however , their mid - ir fluxes are substantially weaker than typical primordial disk fluxes , lying below the lower - quartile taurus sed @xcite .",
    "their emission is also weaker than that for geometrically flat , reprocessing blackbody disks viewed face on ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* see figure 1 ) . because face - on flat disks exhibit the weakest ir emission that can come from an optically - thick disk , homologously depleted disks",
    "have a substantially reduced ir optical depth and thus a depleted mass of ir - emitting dust .",
    "if this ir emitting dust traces the bulk disk mass , then these disks are losing disk mass simultaneously over a wide range of radii .",
    "+ disk masses for homologously depleted disks , as inferred from submm fluxes and from modeling ir - to - submm seds , are systematically lower than those for primordial disks ( m@xmath5 @xmath6 10@xmath7 m@xmath8 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , these disks have a lower frequency of accretion and lower typical accretion rates @xcite ; disks lacking evidence for accretion have the lowest masses . in light of these properties ,",
    "homologously depleted disks are much more likely undergoing an overall depletion of disk mass , not simply dust settling .",
    "thus , homologously depleted disks likely represent a distinct evolutionary outcome @xcite .",
    "comparing the frequencies of transitional disks to primordial disks derived from sed modeling for 110 myr - old clusters constrains the mean transitional disk lifetime .",
    "traditionally , the transitional disk lifetime was thought to be short , @xmath2 0.010.1 myr , based on the paucity of transitional disks in myr - old star - forming regions like taurus .",
    "however , if disks spend @xmath1 0.010.1 myr of their 35 myr lifetime as transitional disks , then transitional disks should also be far rarer than primordial disks in older ( 310 myr ) clusters .",
    "spitzer observations show that @xmath6 20% of disks surrounding 12 myr - old 0.51.4 m@xmath8 stars are in transition , but at least 50% and as many as 80% of disks are transitional disks by @xmath2 56 myr @xcite .",
    "based on these results , @xcite show that the transition timescale is @xmath1 1 myr . to investigate this issue",
    "further , i have applied the disk classification scheme from @xcite to other 110 myr - old clusters , modified to include the flat reprocessing disk sed as an additional check on whether a disk is primordial or whether it is a homologously depleted transitional disk .",
    "as shown by figure 2 , the transitional disk frequency increases with time , climbing above @xmath2 4050% for all clusters",
    "older than 4 myr . for reference ,",
    "i overplot the approximate locus of transitional disk frequencies assuming a clearing timescale of @xmath2 0.5 myr @xcite .",
    "transitional disk frequencies for all clusters , most obviously those older than 3 myr , lie above the 0.5 myr locus indicating that the typical transitional disk lifetime must be longer .",
    "@xcite also find that the transitional disk frequency increases with time .",
    "their frequencies for 310 myr - old clusters agree with those here if both disks with inner holes and homologously depleted ( `` warm''/``weak '' excess sources in their terminology ) are counted as transitional disks .",
    "@xcite dispute these claims , arguing that many of the transitional disks identified by @xcite and @xcite , especially the homologously depleted disks , are simply primordial disks with dust settling . to make this argument",
    ", they determine the irac and mips colors for a two grain population disk model from @xcite with an extremely low accretion rate ( @xmath9 = 10@xmath10 m@xmath11 yr@xmath12 ) and a `` depletion factor '' , @xmath13 = 0.001 , which removes 99.9% of the small dust grains and compare these colors to those for several 110 myr - old clusters .    besides not knowing whether their adopted disk model is physically realistic 100 - 1000 times faster than observed @xcite .",
    "since fragmentation in a collisionally dominated disk produces copious amounts of small dust , it is unclear whether disks can lose 99.9% of their small dust while retaining their 10 @xmath3 to 1 mm - sized dust , especially in the presence of turbulence .",
    "] , their analysis contains questionable features which undermine their conclusions .",
    "for example , the luhman et al .",
    "conclusions are extremely sensitive to assumed values for their free parameters ( @xmath13 and @xmath9 ) . assuming either that disks only remove 99% of their small dust instead of 99.9% or have a still - tiny accretion rate of @xmath9 = 10@xmath14 m@xmath8 yr@xmath12 revises their fiducial irac and mips primordial disk colors redwards by @xmath2 0.5 mags , which then yields the results from @xcite . more generally , of the 16 combinations of @xmath13 and @xmath9 shown in figure 13 of dalessio et al . , the only combination yielding the luhman et al .",
    "results is the one luhman et al adopts .",
    "thus , models yielding the conclusions of @xcite occupy a very narrow range of parameter space .",
    "many 110 myr - old sources identified as transitional by currie et al . and",
    "others are accreting at rates that must be much greater than 10@xmath10 m@xmath8 yr@xmath12 ( e.g. id-36 in ngc 2362 ) , so the appropriate dalessio et al model in many cases clearly can not be the one they adopt .",
    "furthermore , sed modeling of sources show that some claimed to be primordial by @xcite such as id-3 in ngc 2362 have large inner holes .",
    "the @xcite classification scheme would also identify ux tau and lkca 15 as primordial disks .",
    "however , as the same authors showed in previous work ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , these disks have large , @xmath2 50 au - scale holes consistent with substantial disk clearing and inconsistent with a primordial disk morphology . using the colors of ux tau , lkca 15 , dm tau and others as an empirical division between primordial and transitional disks also recovers the results from @xcite 23 .",
    "however , prf - fitting photometry and supplemental analysis of the processed mosaic show that most have snr @xmath4 5 and thus should not be excluded . ] .",
    "figure [ diskevo ] summarizes the general picture of disk evolution outlined by @xcite .",
    "most optically - thick primordial disks last between 2 myr and 5 myr , depending on stellar mass . after this time",
    ", they begin to show evidence of dust clearing either at a wide range of disk locations simultaneously ( a `` homologously depleted '' disk ) or open a gap / inner hole and deplete from the inside out . after 5 ( 3 , 10 ) myr , most solar - mass stars ( 2.0 m@xmath8 stars , subsolar - mass stars ) either lack disks or have debris disks ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "comparing transitional disk properties to other disk diagnostics and stellar properties constrains plausible mechanisms responsible for forming such disks . for transitional disks with inner holes ,",
    "the hole size is correlated with stellar mass / t@xmath15 and x - ray luminosity but is only weakly correlated / not correlated with accretion rate @xcite . @xcite identify a correlation between accretion rate and disk mass in taurus : transitional disks systematically have larger disk masses ( as inferred from submm data ) than primordal disks with the same accretion rates .",
    "based on a sample of stars with transitional disks at a wider range of ages , @xcite find instead that disk mass and accretion rate are anticorrelated . since clearing induced by a gas giant planet probably occurs in more massive disks and photoevaporate clearing occurs after disks have lost significant mass @xcite , the conflicting results over @xmath9 vs. m@xmath16 may point to multiple processes responsible for forming inner holes @xcite .",
    "since homologously depleted transitional disks lack evidence for inner holes / gaps , their morphologies are not naturally explainable by gap - opening planets . based on results from @xcite and @xcite",
    ", their accretion properties and disk masses may be consistent with a simple viscous draining of disk material with time , perhaps accelerated by weak photoevaporation .",
    "the homologously depleted disk morphology may occupy an important region of disk / star parameter space .",
    "compared to 13 m@xmath8 stars , the frequency of massive , rv - detected planets orbiting @xmath2 0.5 m@xmath8 stars is far lower @xcite .",
    "these low - mass stars may have a higher frequency of homologously depleted transitional disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "disk clearing timescales from photoevaporation may also be longest for the lowest - mass stars ( @xmath17 1 myr * ? ? ?",
    "a homologously depleted disk morphology is then a plausible outcome of a disk that fails to form gas giant planets and is irradiated by a low stellar uv flux .",
    "many caveats qualify these conclusions about transitional disk properties .",
    "since there may be multiple mechanisms responsible for explaining the morphologies of transitional disks a `` transition timescale '' derived from the number of all transitional disks regardless of morphology is only a mean value of the timescales from a number of different mechanisms .",
    "for example , it s entirely possible that disk clearing from gap - opening planets explains a subset of transitional disks and often occurs on fast @xmath2 0.1 myr timescales , whereas other mechanisms operate more slowly .",
    "differentiating between a rapidly operating disk clearing mechanism and one that operates less frequently requires sophisticated multiwavelength analyses of disks around stars with a wide range of ages ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the disk clearing time for many candidate mechanisms ( e.g. gas giant planet formation , uv photoevaporation ) depends on properties that likely have a large intrinsic dispersion , such as disk viscosity , initial angular momentum , mass . in turn",
    ", there may be an intrinsic dispersion in transition timescales like the intrinsic dispersion in protoplanetary disk lifetimes . while the mean transition timescale ( averaged over all disk clearing mechanisms )",
    "may be closer to @xmath2 1 myr as found by @xcite , it is quite plausible that many disks , including those in the youngest regions like taurus , disperse on much shorter timescales @xcite .",
    "finally , inferring gas and dust masses in transitional disks from ir to submm dust emission is fraught with uncertainties . deriving the dust mass from ir to submm sed",
    "modeling requires assuming a dust opacity , @xmath18 .",
    "since the dust opacity is not strictly known , what is actually derived from sed modeling is the product of the dust mass and dust opacity , not simply the dust mass .",
    "the total disk mass is even more uncertain since it requires assuming a gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "the models used here , in @xcite , and other work ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) assume standard values for @xmath18 and a solar gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "however , comparing derived disk masses from these methods to estimates based on accretion rates indicates that the former methods may systematically underestimate the total disk mass @xcite .",
    "sed modeling and accretion diagnostics for both types of transitional disks indicate that they are evolutionary states distinct from primordial disks . but quantitatively assessing how transitional disks probe clearing of both gas and dust requires diagnostics of circumstellar gas sensitive to the bulk gas mass in planet - forming regions .",
    "new and upcoming facilities allow studies of transitional disks that complement and clarify results based on spitzer work .",
    "the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) will provide extremely sensitive , high angular - resolution data to better constrain spatial extents , inner hole sizes , surface density profiles , and masses of known transitional disks .",
    "alma may also identify new transitional disks with inner holes / gaps too small to be confidently inferred from sed modeling .",
    "the most crucial , hitherto underexplored angle for investigating transitional disks is the disks gas content .",
    "gas diagnostics for transitional disks are typically limited to accretion , which identifies the presence of hot circumstellar gas near the star . however , gas in cooler planet - forming regions is more relevant in the context of disks evolving from pre planet building to post - planet building stages .",
    "_ herschel _ offers a sensitive probe of far - ir line emission to identify cool gas in disks .",
    "_ herschel _ programs such as gasps will survey many 110 myr - old stars for evidence of circumstellar gas and thus provide strong constraints on gas dissipation as a function of time . comparing the gas properties of transitional disks with those for primordial disks",
    "will more definitively determine how transitional disks are clearing their gas , complementing studies of dust clearing .",
