    "renormalization - group techniques have long been established as the standard formal framework for understanding critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "those based on effective hamiltonians of the ginzburg - landau - wilson type require some kind of supplementary approximation if concrete information is to be extracted from them , and this is normally provided by perturbation theory , in the form either of the @xmath6 expansion introduced originally by wilson and fisher @xcite or of a fixed - dimension calculation @xcite . for @xmath7 symmetric models ,",
    "a systematic expansion in powers of @xmath1 provides an alternative method of approximation @xcite .",
    "while the methods that have been used to extract estimates of critical exponents as power series in @xmath1 are informed by renormalization - group ideas , there seems to exist no method for implementing this approximation scheme within a systematic renormalization - group analysis .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to describe a renormalization scheme which does this .",
    "as is well known , the few terms of the @xmath1 expansions for critical exponents that it has been possible to calculate explicitly do not yield accurate results for the small values of @xmath8 that characterize physically interesting systems , so the development of a new formal technique is not especially useful from this point of view .",
    "our motivation for developing this scheme arises from our efforts to estimate critical - point scaling functions for thermodynamic properties of superconductors in applied magnetic fields , in particular the specific heat , for which experimental data have been available for some time ( see , for example @xcite ) . for this problem ,",
    "it turns out that perturbation theory does not yield a well - controlled sequence of approximations . as reported in an accompanying paper @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath1 expansion is advantageous in this respect , and yields qualitatively encouraging results , although quantitative agreement with existing data is still hard to achieve .    in outline ,",
    "the renormalization - group strategy we propose works as follows .",
    "consider , for example , the order - parameter susceptibility @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is proportional to @xmath11 , @xmath12 is a coupling constant which can be taken as temperature - independent in the critical region and @xmath13 is a momentum cutoff of the order of the inverse of a typical interatomic distance . in the limit @xmath14",
    ", we expect this susceptibility to diverge as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a universal exponent which we would like to determine . in general",
    ", a renormalization scheme introduces a renormalized susceptibility @xmath17 , together with renormalized parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which depend on an arbitrary length scale , say @xmath20 . the fact that physics is independent of @xmath21 leads to a relation of the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an arbitrary number .",
    "the prefactor @xmath24 and the running variables @xmath25 and @xmath26 depend on how the renormalization has been implemented .",
    "now , the function @xmath27 diverges when its first argument , @xmath18 , approaches zero , but the nature of this singularity is hard to determine directly .",
    "suppose , however , that the renormalization scheme has been constructed in such a way that @xmath28 in the limit @xmath29 , where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( the ` fixed - point ' coupling ) are constants . by setting @xmath33",
    ", we find in the limit @xmath14 @xmath34 the exponent @xmath30 will be equal to the true critical exponent @xmath16 if @xmath35 has a finite , nonzero value and the renormalization scheme must be designed to ensure that this is so .",
    "the exponent @xmath31 will then be equal to the critical exponent @xmath36 , which characterizes the divergence of the correlation length .",
    "these calculations can not be carried out exactly , so a renormalization scheme must be supplemented by some systematic means of approximation and its details will depend on this method of approximation .",
    "perturbative methods of approximation , involving an expansion in powers of @xmath19 , rely on the possibility of expressing exponents such as @xmath16 as power series in @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the spatial dimensionality ( although in practice it proves possible also to implement them directly in three dimensions ) . near four dimensions ,",
    "the bare susceptibility @xmath9 and other thermodynamic functions diverge as @xmath39 , so the principal requirement of a renormalization scheme is to remove these divergences from renormalized functions such as @xmath17 .",
    "one then finds that @xmath32 is of order @xmath6 , so the perturbative analysis can be implemented self - consistently .    for the reasons outlined above",
    ", we wish to make use of an alternative approximation scheme consisting of an expansion in powers of @xmath1 with @xmath40 .",
    "a systematic means of obtaining the @xmath1 expansion is reviewed in section ii .",
    "it is facilitated by an integral transformation of the hubbard - stratonovich type which expresses the partition function as a functional integral over an auxiliary field @xmath41 , with an effective hamiltonian @xmath42 .",
    "this partition function can be calculated as a power series in @xmath1 by the method of steepest descent . within this expansion ,",
    "thermodynamic quantities are most naturally expressed as functions not of the temperature variable @xmath18 , but rather of the exact inverse susceptibility @xmath43 .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath44 is given implicitly by solving a constraint equation of the form @xmath45 .",
    "at lowest order , this constraint equation simply locates the saddle point @xmath46 of the effective hamiltonian @xmath42 .    in section iii",
    ", a renormalization scheme is exhibited which manifestly extracts the correct critical exponents at leading order . in the case of the susceptibility ,",
    "the renormalized constraint equation @xmath47 obeys a relation equivalent to ( [ rgchi ] ) , but with the roles of @xmath18 and @xmath48 reversed .",
    "the substantive issue , addressed in section iv , is how this renormalization scheme can properly be extended to higher orders .",
    "the usual perturbative strategy fails at this point , because in 3 dimensions the constraint function @xmath49 and other thermodynamic quantities remain finite as @xmath39 . for this reason",
    ", we shall actually omit the cutoff altogether in subsequent sections .",
    "we find , however , that the fixed - point coupling strength @xmath32 is infinite , and that divergences appear in the limit @xmath50 .",
    "for this reason , we find it convenient to deal with the inverse of the renormalized coupling , @xmath3 , so that the fixed point appears at @xmath51 . in the context of the @xmath1 expansion , then , the primary requirement of a renormalization scheme is not to remove divergences that appear as @xmath39 , but rather to remove those that appear as @xmath52 .",
    "this crucial observation is the first result that we wish to report .",
    "the second is a concrete renormalization scheme that actually does remove the divergences at @xmath2 .",
    "as shown in section iv , this can be achieved economically by means of a ` minimal subtraction ' scheme which subtracts powers of @xmath53 .",
    "we have , of course , checked that the critical exponents obtained from our renormalization scheme agree with those obtained long ago by other methods .",
    "however , our purpose in devising this novel renormalization - group strategy is not simply to reproduce old results by a different method .",
    "the application of this formalism that we have mainly in view is the calculation of scaling functions . in particular ,",
    "the specific heat of a superconductor near its critical point , and in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath54 , is expected to assume the scaling form @xmath55 and we wish to estimate the scaling function @xmath56 , for which experimental data are available . when the ginzburg - landau model is enlarged to include the magnetic field",
    ", the renormalized specific heat obeys a relation similar to ( [ rgchi ] ) , namely @xmath57 by setting @xmath58 and @xmath59 , we can identify the scaling function as @xmath60 , with @xmath61 determined as a function of @xmath62 by solution of the constraint equation , which then has the form @xmath63 .",
    "details of this calculation are presented in @xcite ; here , our principal concern is to explain the renormalization - group formalism that makes it feasible .",
    "it happens that special considerations apply to the critical behaviour of the specific heat @xcite and the impact of these on the renormalization - group formalism is discussed in section v.    while the main purpose of this paper is to expose details of the renormalization scheme that will be applied in @xcite , we also wish to report what we believe to be a novel feature of the renormalization group , revealed by the non - perturbative nature of the @xmath1 expansion , that is of some theoretical interest .",
    "the leading corrections to asymptotic critical singularities ( sometimes described as confluent singularities ) appear in the form of a scaling variable @xmath64 . according to conventional wisdom , the order - parameter susceptibility",
    ", say , has a singular part which can be expressed as @xmath65 , where the scaling function @xmath66 has a power series expansion in @xmath67 . in perturbation theory , this is automatically true , but the @xmath1 expansion suggests otherwise . in 3 dimensions , at least , we find that @xmath66 contains , in addition to powers of @xmath67 , singular terms which at next - to - leading order are of the form @xmath68 .",
    "this is shown in section iv and further discussed , along with our other principal findings in section vi .",
    "we consider the standard ginzburg - landau - wilson theory for @xmath8 complex fields , defined by the hamiltonian density @xmath69 in which @xmath10 is taken to be linear in temperature ( @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the mean - field transition temperature ) and the coupling strength @xmath12 to be temperature - independent .",

    "this is beyond our present skill , but we have verified that the procedure does work ( with @xmath279 ) at next - to leading order . in perturbative renormalization schemes , as is well known , an additive renormalization is also required to make a quantity analogous to @xmath280 finite in the limit @xmath281 . in that case , the additive term depends on the renormalization scale @xmath21 and , in consequence , the renormalized specific heat obeys an inhomogeneous renormalization - group equation ( see , for example @xcite )",
    ". here , by contrast , the first two terms on the right - hand side of ( [ crenorm ] ) are functions only of @xmath12 and @xmath10 , so @xmath280 obeys a homogeneous equation of the form ( [ rgeqn ] ) .",

    "we have proposed a renormalization scheme within which critical exponents and scaling functions for an @xmath8-vector ginzburg - landau model can be estimated by means of a systematic expansion in @xmath1 . from the field - theoretic point of view",
    ", the essential function of the renormalization group is to relate the values of correlation functions in the critical region , where infrared singularities arise from the vanishing ` mass ' @xmath287 , to their values when @xmath18 is of order 1 , as exhibited in ( [ rgsolution ] ) . to ensure that critical singularities are correctly exponentiated",
    ", a renormalization scheme must ensure that these singularities do not reappear from the running of other parameters . in the context of the @xmath1 expansion ,",
    "this potentially happens when the inverse quartic coupling constant @xmath288 vanishes , and the essential feature of our renormalization scheme is to ensure that renormalized correlation functions have finite limits when @xmath52 . in 3 dimensions ,",
    "the minimal way of achieving this is to subtract leading powers of @xmath53 , and this procedure does indeed serve to recover the standard results for critical exponents .    the main purpose of this paper is to explain how the scheme works , in preparation for a detailed investigation of the critical properties of high - temperature superconductors to be described in @xcite .",
    "however , in the course of the formal investigation reported here , we have encountered a general feature that seems to have been unsuspected hitherto .",
    "it has usually been taken for granted that the approach to a critical point can be described by expressing the hamiltonian in the form @xmath289 , where @xmath290 is an infrared stable fixed - point hamiltonian and the @xmath291 are eigenoperators of the renormalization group at this fixed point ( see , for example @xcite ) . by expanding correlation functions in powers of the coefficients @xmath292 , one expects to obtain corrections to the asymptotic critical singularities in the form of powers of the scaling variables @xmath293 , with exponents @xmath294 determined by the eigenvalues of the @xmath291 . in treatments based on perturbative expansions in the coupling constant @xmath19 , this expectation",
    "is realized automatically in the case of corrections of the form @xmath295 associated with departures of @xmath19 from its fixed - point value @xmath32 . within the non - perturbative approximation scheme afforded by the @xmath1 expansion",
    ", however , this does not happen .",
    "we see explicitly that the fixed point corresponds to @xmath296 , and that correlation functions do not possess power - series expansions in @xmath171 .",
    "although scaling is maintained , in the sense that corrections appear in terms of the scaling variable @xmath297 , scaling functions such as that exhibited in ( [ scalingwithlog ] ) for the inverse susceptibility are not expressible as power series in @xmath67 .    at relative order @xmath1 ,",
    "the non - analyticity of the scaling functions is logarithmic , and this is probably true at higher orders also .",
    "these are not , however , the same as the well - known logarithmic corrections that occur at the upper critical dimension @xmath298 @xcite where @xmath299 is a marginal operator .",
    "the latter arise from a degeneracy in the renormalization - group equations which destroy the scaling property , yielding logarithms of @xmath258 rather than of a scaling variable such as @xmath67 .",
    "in fact , our renormalization scheme is restricted to @xmath40 ; we do not know in detail how to formulate a similar scheme in general dimensions .",
    "quite possibly , the singularities we encountered appear , like the abe - hikami specific heat anomaly , only at special , rational values of @xmath38 , and it is not clear whether they need be logarithmic in general .",
    "it is also far from clear whether they are of more than academic interest . in principle",
    ", they should presumably be present in , for example , the specific heat of @xmath300 near the lambda transition ( corresponding to @xmath301 ) , where rather precise measurements of critical properties have been made @xcite .",
    "the data are reasonably consistent with the assumed power - law correction , but may well not be precise enough to detect a logarithmic factor .",
    "unfortunately , while the non - perturbative nature of the @xmath1 expansion is helpful in indicating the presence of these logarithms , its notoriously poor convergence make it hard to estimate the likely sizes of the coefficients that multiply them .",
    "the financial support of the engineering and physical sciences research council through research grant gr / m09261 is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "to implement our renormalization scheme at next - to - leading order in the @xmath1 expansion , we need to know the singularities of the integrals ( [ aintegral ] ) and ( [ b1integral ] ) - ( [ b3integral ] ) near @xmath302 .",
