    "studies of spatially indirect excitons ( ix ) in semiconductors have attracted considerable research efforts since early 1960 s , fueled by the prediction of the remarkable quantum properties .",
    "this resulted in recent demonstration of quantum coherent effects including spontaneous coherence @xcite , long - range spin currents and associated polarization textures @xcite of indirect excitons .",
    "an ix can be formed by an electron and a hole confined in separate coupled quantum wells ( cqw ) .",
    "application of the electric field across the cqws bends the band structure so that the ix state became the ground state of the system @xcite .",
    "the spatial separation of electrons and holes within ix allows them to achieve long lifetimes , which may be orders of magnitude longer than the lifetimes of spatially direct excitons ( dx ) . at the same time",
    ", the spatial separation of electrons and holes strongly reduces the oscillator strength of ixs , with respect to dxs .",
    "this determines the choice of the experimental methods for studies of these quasiparticles .",
    "the most frequently used optical methods are based on the emission ( photoluminescence , pl ) spectroscopy .",
    "the pl signal scales linearly with the emission rate in time - resolved experiments and is nearly independent on the emission rate in cw experiments for the samples with low nonradiative recombination .",
    "a set of the linear optics methods was employed for studies of ixs , including the imaging spectroscopy butov2002 , the time - resolved imaging @xcite , the polarization - resolved imaging @xcite , and the first - order coherence measurements @xcite . however , the powerful methods of nonlinear optics , which have been successfully applied for dxs in quantum wells ( qw ) @xcite , @xcite remain unexplored in the studies of ixs .",
    "a nonlinear optical process , in its broadest definition , is a process in which the optical properties of the medium depend on the light field itself @xcite . in the case of optical pumping in semiconductors ,",
    "light - induced modifications of the optical properties of the medium can persist for a long time after the perturbing light is turned off . in this case , a pump - probe arrangement can be used , with pump and probe interactions separated in time @xcite .",
    "this allows for time - resolved studies of optical and spin coherence in the medium . in semiconductor",
    "qws resonant optical pumping of dx resonance with circularly polarized light , and subsequent detection of the pump - induced dispersive response is widely used to study exciton population and spin dynamics @xcite . experimentally ,",
    "either modification of intensity ( photoinduced reflectivity ) or the rotation of the polarization plane of the linearly polarized probe pulse ( photoinduced kerr rotation ) upon reflection from the sample are measured @xcite .",
    "these signals are proportional to the square of the oscillator strength of the excitonic transition and have a pronounced resonant character @xcite .",
    "thus , because the oscillator strength of ix is orders of magnitude lower than for dx , it is impossible to simply transpose the ideas developed for nonlinear spectroscopy of dx to ix .    in this paper , we show how ixs , despite their vanishing oscillator strengths , can induce measurable photoinduced reflectivity and kerr rotation .",
    "our proposal relies on two peculiar properties of the cqw structures .",
    "the first essential property is the spin conserving tunneling of electrons between the qws @xcite .",
    "it allows for substantial spin polarization of ix via optical orientation of dxs .",
    "this has been unambiguously demonstrated by polarization - resolved photoluminescence experiments @xcite .",
    "thus , optical pumping of ixs can de realized via the dx state .",
    "the second imporant effect is the spin - dependent coupling between dx and ix states .",
    "this coupling is quite strong in cqw , where each ix and each dx have either holes or electrons located in the same qw .",
    "this is why the presence of ix population in the structure alters dx resonance properties , mainly via spin - dependent exchange interactions .",
    "@xcite or with high momenta beyond the radiative zone @xcite were probed via the energy shift and optical decay rate of bright indirect excitons ( with spin @xmath0 and momenta within the radiative zone ) , see e.g. @xcite . ]",
    "therefore , we suggest that the detection of ix population and spin polarization can also be realized by exploiting the dx resonance .",
    "the kerr rotation measured at the dx resonance is a sensitive method to access populations and spin polarizations of both bright and dark ix states .",
    "it may be used , in particular , for studies of dark excitons which strongly affect spin properties of excitonic condensates @xcite .",
    "we study the effect of dx - ix interaction quantitatively , calculating the spin - dependent shifts of the dx resonances in the presence of spin - polarized gas of ixs within hartree - fock and effective mass approximation .",
    "a phenomenological model based on non - local dielectric response model predicts the spectral dependence of photoinduced kerr rotation and reflectivity induced by ixs and allows to analyze the impact of bright and dark ixs and dxs on these spectra .",
    "we also apply spin density matrix formalism to describe the dynamics of pump - probe signal in a realistic cqw structure .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe phenomenologically the spectral dependence of the reflectivity and kerr rotation induced by spin - polarized ixs in the vicinity of dx resonance .",
    "section iii is devoted to the explicit calculation dx - ix and ix - ix interaction energies . in section",
    "iv we formulate the spin density matrix model of excitons in cqws .",
    "it accounts for optical generation of dx excitons , tunneling between the qws and spin relaxation .",
    "we use the basis of @xmath1 exciton states ( both dx and ix have four possible spin projections on the growth axis ) and calculate typical reflectivity and kerr rotation signals as a function of delay between pump and probe pulses .",
    "section v summarizes and concludes the paper .",
    "in this section we analyse phenomenologically the effect of the ix population in the cqw structure on the polarization and intensity of the linearly polarized weak probe wave , resonant with the dx transition .",
    "let us consider a cqw structure schematically shown in figure 1 .",
    "it consist of two qws , separated by a potential barrier of the width @xmath2 and covered by a thick barrier layer of the width @xmath3 .",
    "a static electric field is applied along the @xmath4-axis , perpendicular to the cqw plane .",
    "two optically - active ground dx levels in this system with total spin @xmath0 are denoted as @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and the corresponding wavefunctions as @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . have zero oscillator strength and do not contribute to the reflectivity spectra ] hereafter ,",
    "the indices @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) denote the qw where electrons ( holes ) are driven by the static gate voltage . in the case of two identical quantum wells , dx levels split into symmetrical and antisymmetrical states with very small energy difference @xcite that we will ignore here and assume @xmath11 .",
    "[ structure ]    the electric field of the incident probe beam can be written as @xmath12 . here",
    "we consider the normally incident probe beam characterized by the wavevector @xmath13 , propagating along @xmath4-axis and linearly polarized along the @xmath14 axis . the amplitude reflection coefficient from qw for such wave in the vicinity of one of dx transition frequencies @xmath15",
    "is related to the exciton wavefunction @xmath16 by a textbook formula @xcite taken in the limit of @xmath17 : @xmath18where the radiative decay rate is given in @xmath19 ^{2 } ,   \\label{gamma0}\\]]@xmath20 is the longitudinal - transverse splitting , @xmath21 is the bulk exciton bohr radius , @xmath22 is the sample normalization area , and @xmath23 is the exciton non - radiative decay rate , @xmath24 is the in - plane separation of electron and hole , @xmath25 are electron ( hole ) @xmath4 coordinates . in the most experimentally relevant case @xmath26 . taking into account the interference between waves reflected from the surface of the cap layer having a refractive index @xmath27 and those reflected from cqws , neglecting re - reflections and reflections from deeper layers of the structure ,",
    "the total reflectivity coefficient is @xmath28    [ spectra ]    the presence of ixs can affect the dx transition parameters @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath23 through various mechanisms .",
    "spin - dependent coulomb interactions between ixs and dxs leads to the blue shift of dx levels and , in the case when ixs are polarized , their spin - splitting .",
    "ixs also saturate dx transitions due to the phase space filling effect , since ixs consist of electrons and holes in the same qws as dxs .",
    "this effect is again spin - dependent .",
    "finally , ixs may affect the non - radiative decay of dxs through the scattering processes involving spin - dependent transitions between dx and ix levels , or by screening the disorder potential .",
    "the renormalisation of exciton resonance frequencies and spin - splittings due to these interactions is responsible for the modulation of reflectivity and kerr rotation spectra .",
    "indeed , all the interaction effects listed above can be accounted for by correcting the reflection coefficients for two circularly polarized components of the probe pulse ,",
    "@xmath31 : @xmath32 the electric field of the reflected probe wave can be expressed in terms of these corrections as @xmath33e^{i(kz-\\omega t)}.\\]]here the basis of right and left circularly polarized waves @xmath34 is used .",
    "one can see , that in the most general case , the corrections of the reflection coefficient may induce ( i ) circular dichroism , which leads to the build up of circular polarization , ( ii ) circular birefringence , which leads to the rotation of the polarization plane , or kerr rotation , and ( iii ) modification of the probe intensity . in the limit of @xmath35 kerr rotation angle is linear in @xmath36 @xcite , while photoinduced reflectivity is linear in @xmath37 : @xmath38    substituting eqs.([structure_refl ] , [ correction ] ) into eq.(intens_phi ) we express the three contributions to the photoinduced kerr rotation and reflectivity as a function of corresponding modification of the excitonic characteristic @xmath39 , which spans over the resonant frequency , radiative and non - radiative decay rates @xmath40 : @xmath41    figure 2 shows the contributions of different mechanisms to photoinduced kerr rotation and reflectivity spectra in the vicinity of the dx resonance , calculated using eqs.([intens_phi_r ] ) , assuming @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and normalized so that @xmath45 .",
    "this corresponds to : blue shift of the dx energy @xmath46 ( red solid line ) , reduction of the dx oscillator strength @xmath47 ( blue dashed line ) and enhancement of non - radiative decay of dx , @xmath48 ( green dotted line ) .",
    "one can see , that the spectral profiles are qualitatively different .",
    "thus , measuring photoinduced spectra should make possible the identification of the underlying nonlinearity .",
    "note also , that spectral shape depends on the value of the phase factor @xmath49 in the eq .",
    "( [ intens_phi_r ] ) , so that @xmath50 and @xmath51 transform as imaginary and real parts of a complex value between the braces .",
    "the roadmap for the measurement of the pump - probe signal induced by ix and determination of the underling nonlinearities can be as follows .",
    "first of all , in real time - resolved pump - probe experiments , one operates with short pulses of light rather than with monochromatic waves .",
    "therefore , to measure spectral dependence of the nonlinear signal the probe spectral width must be smaller than the dx linewidth ( @xmath52 ) , which is accessible experimentally @xcite .",
    "second , one should avoid any contribution of dx population to the nonlinear signal .",
    "this can be easily realized by setting the delay between pump and probe pulses sufficiently long , because dx lifetime does not exceed @xmath53 ps , while ix lifetime is at least an order of magnitude longer .",
    "finally , fitting the measured pump - induced reflectivity and kerr rotation spectra to eq.(intens_phi ) assuming different excitonic nonlinearities , it should be possible to determine the relative importance of different mechanisms of dx - ix interaction . in the next section ,",
    "we show that at least one of the discussed mechanisms , namely energy shift of dx resonance , should produce a measurable nonliner signal in realistic cqw structures .",
    "in this section we estimate the strength of dx - ix coulomb interaction in a typical cqw structure . following the approach of ciuti1998,laikhtman , shelykh2012 we use the hartree - fock and effective mass approximations to find matrix elements of the coulomb interaction hamiltonian . our objective is to calculate the energy shifts of the bright dx levels @xmath54 and @xmath55 induced in the first order by the population of both bright ( @xmath56 ) and dark ( @xmath57 ) ix states .",
    "we also give estimations for ix - ix interaction energy within the same model , to compare with the pl line - shifts observed experimentally and with existing theoretical results .",

    "dxs in both symmetric qws are pumped simultaneously , ( ii ) cqws are asymmetric , and we excite selectively dxs in the electron qw , in which case ixs are formed due to the hole tunneling , ( iii ) cqws are asymmetric , and we excite selectively dxs in the hole qw , so that ixs are formed due to the electron tunneling . the cases ( ii ) and ( iii ) will be referred to as `` electron qw pumping '' and `` hole qw pumping '' , respectively , to emphasize that in the case ( ii ) we optically create electrons in the same well where electrons of the lowest energy ixs are , while in the case ( iii ) we excite holes in the same well where the holes of the lowest energy ixs stay .    figures [ dynamics](a , b , c ) show populations of bright and dark dx and ix states as functions of time in the cases ( i , ii , iii ) , respectively . in all cases the main features or ix and dx population dynamics are the same : the ixs population initially increases , while the dx population shows a fast decay due to the tunneling of electrons ( ii ) , holes ( iii ) , or both ( i ) , and radiative recombination of dxs . at longer times , the ix population slowly decreases .",
    "bright and dark exciton populations quickly equalize due to the hole spin relaxation .",
    "note that maximum amount of ixs left after vanishing of dxs depends on the rate of conversion from dxs to ixs , which is different for listed cases .",
    "the conversion due to the electron tunneling is faster than one due to the hole tunneling because of the lighter electron than heavy hole effective mass in the structure growth direction .",

    "this is not surprising as the kerr effect is sensitive not only to the population of ixs but also to their spin polarization , which decays faster than population .",
    "there are two time - scales in the kerr signal corresponding to the hole and electron spin relaxation times . in the case of asymmetric cqws both reflectivity and kerr signals are initially much stronger at the exciton resonance in the pumped qw , while at the characteristic time - scale of the tunneling transfer the reflectivity signals from both wells become comparable .",
    "the kerr signal is always stronger in the electron qw than in the hole qw as the electron spin relaxation time is much longer than the hole spin relaxation time .",

    "three different types of nonlinearities due to dx - ix interactions can be identified .",
    "namely , dx resonance can shift in energy , change of its oscillator strength and/or broadening .",
    "we have shown , that relative contribution of these three mechanisms in measured time - resolved kerr rotation and reflectivity can be identified via spectral profile of the photoinduced signal .",
    "the calculation of dx - ix interaction energy allows to predict measurable nonlinear signals in cqw structures .",
    "moreover , in asymmetric cqw structures where two distinct dx resonances can be addressed , kerr rotation may provide information on both bright and dark exciton spin density . to go further , we built up the spin density matrix formalism accounting for both dx and ix dynamics , relevant for realistic pump - probe experiments .",
