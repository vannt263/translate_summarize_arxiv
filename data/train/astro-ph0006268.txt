    "recently , the _ asca _ observations of two radio - loud quasars , pks 0637 - 752 ( at @xmath0=0.654 ) and pks 2149 - 306 ( at @xmath0=2.345 ) , revealed evidence for the presence of doppler - shifted emission lines in the x - ray spectra of these objects ( yaqoob et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ) . for pks 0637 - 752 ,",
    "the line observed at @xmath11 kev ( or @xmath11.6 kev in the rest - frame of the source ) was interpreted as the blue - shifted ovii line ; for pks 2149 - 306 , the line observed at @xmath15.1 kev ( or @xmath117 kev in the rest - frame of the source ) was thought to be the blue - shifted iron k emission line .",
    "if the interpretation is valid , the inferred doppler - shift of the lines would be quite similar for both quasars ; such emission lines would be likely to originate in the relativistic jets ( yaqoob et al .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of seyfert galaxy mcg 6 - 30 - 15 , where iron line is detected and its profile has a strong wing toward _ low _ energies ( tanaka et al 1995 ) .",
    "such a profile is characteristic of emission lines from the inner region of the accretion disk ( fabian et al .",
    "1989 , 1995 ) .",
    "although the disk origin of the line seems secure for mcg 6 - 15 - 30 ( see misra 1999 and reynolds 1999 for more evidence ) , the observed iron line is too broader to be accounted for by this scenario for 3c 120 and 3c 382 ( both are radio - loud ; reynolds 1997 ) .",
    "perhaps , the latter can also be attributed to relativistic jets .    for stellar - mass black hole candidates , margon et al ( 1979 )",
    "found the large , periodic doppler drift in the optical lines of ss 433 .",
    "this has been explained remarkably well by a kinematic model ( fabian & rees 1979 ) which invokes two processing jets with velocity of @xmath2 light speed ( see review by margon 1984 ) .",
    "more recently , cui et al . ( 1999 ) reported the detection of two emission lines at @xmath1 5.7 kev and 7.7 kev in black hole candidate 4u 1630 - 47 .",
    "they proposed that the lines might arise from a single emission line due to highly ionized ions of fe that is doppler red- and blue - shifted either in a keplerian accretion disk or in a bi - polar outflow ( or even both ) .",
    "the quality of the data does not allow them to distinguish between the two possibilities .    in this paper",
    ", we make an attempt to deriving the profile of an emission line from relativistic jets around a black hole , taking into account of both general and special relativistic effects .",
    "we present the predictions of the model and discuss potential applications of the results .",
    "since we are primarily interested in studying relativistic effects on the profile of emission lines , we chose to neglect the details of the outflow ( or jet ) dynamics and the emission processes of the lines . in the model ,",
    "a jet is treated as a pencil beam along the spin axis of a kerr black hole .",
    "we consider a twin - jet scenario where two jets run in the opposite direction away from the black hole .",
    "recent numerical simulations of jets or outflows from an accretion disk show that the jets may form very close to the black hole ( koide et al 1999 ) . since the accretion disk can not extend toward the black hole beyond the marginally stable orbit ( of radius @xmath3 ) , for simplicity , we assume that the jets start at a distance , @xmath3 , away from the black hole",
    ".    a kerr black hole is fully characterized by its mass ( @xmath4 ) and dimentionless specific angular momentum ( @xmath5 $ ] ) .",
    "the spacetime around such a black hole is described by a metric that is appropriate to a stationary axial symmetry case in the usual form ( misner , thorne & wheeler 1973 ) .",
    "we adopt the boyer - lindquist coordinates and natural units in which @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the gravitational constant and the speed of light , respectively . the propagation of photons can be described by the distribution of photon in phase space defined as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are space and momentum coordinates , respectively .",
    "@xmath12 satisfies the general form of liouville s theorem , @xmath13 , which conserves the total number of photons along a trajectory ( thorne 1967 , ames & thorne 1968 , gerlach 1971 ) .",
    "the liouville s equation can be rewritten as @xmath14 @xmath12 is determined by three constants of motion , total energy @xmath15 , angular momentum component along the symmetry axis @xmath16 , and carter s constant @xmath17 ( carter 1968 ) , as well as by the initial photon locations .",
    "the solution to eq.(1 ) is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the emissivity function of the jets ( at energy @xmath20 ) and @xmath21 the four - velocity .",
    "note that we take the intrinsic profile of the emission line to be a @xmath22 function , although it is probably of a lorentz shape in reality .",
    "a photon trajectory is determined by two dimensionless variables : @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    for the approaching jet",
    ", we have @xmath25 where @xmath26 is defined by @xmath27 in this case , the equation of null geodesic can be simplified to ( carter 1968 , bardeen et al 1972 ) @xmath28 where @xmath29 with @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the usual elliptical integral defined as @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "the left - hand side of eq.(5 ) can be expressed analytically by elliptical integrals ( cadez , fanton & calvani 1998 ) .",
    "we note that @xmath34 for our case because the jets are assumed to be coincide with the spin axis of the black hole .",
    "the equation of motion gives @xmath35 ( bardeen et al .",
    "1972 ) .",
    "we investigate two cases : ( 1 ) jets of constant lorentz factor ( @xmath36 ) and ( 2 ) jets of an accelerating velocity profile @xmath37.\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath38 sets a scale for jet acceleration ; the lorentz factor of the jets approaches the final value ( @xmath36 ) about @xmath39 .",
    "the symmetry of the problem requires @xmath40 and @xmath41 , so we have @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the physical radial velocity of the jets , @xmath44 , and the metric parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 are given by the kerr solutions with @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "finally , we assume a simple power law for the emissivity of the jets , i.e. , @xmath49 , which may or may not be reasonable for real systems .    the observed profile of an emission line from the approaching jet",
    "can then be obtained by integrating over the entire length of the jet , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the impact parameter , indicating the apparent displacement parallel to the axis of symmetry in the sense of the angular momentum of the black hole ( cunningham & bardeen 1973 ) ; @xmath52 is the energy of photons as measured by a distant observer ; and @xmath53 is the viewing angle with respect to the axis of the jet .",
    "we have @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 @xmath57 and @xmath58 with @xmath59 we caution that care must be taken in the derivation since @xmath26 may be a double - valued function .    for the receding jet , there are two types of photon trajectories : ( 1 ) there are no turning points in @xmath60-direction ( but possibly in @xmath61-direction ) , and ( 2 ) there is a turning point in @xmath60-direction . for case 1 , the trajectory equation becomes @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the turning point , which can be determined by setting @xmath64 for a given @xmath65 . for case 2 ,",
    "the trajectory equation is @xmath66,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath60-turning point is at @xmath67 for photons with zero angular momentum .",
    "also for the receding jet , after the turning point in @xmath61 direction , @xmath26 should be replaced by @xmath68 for eq .",
    "the line profile can then be derived following the same procedure as for the approaching jet .",
    "to summarize , there are five free parameters in the model : @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 . in our calculations , we allowed @xmath69 to vary in the range of 0.1 to 3 , @xmath70 in the range of 5  to 75  , and @xmath71 in the range of 0.01 to 1 ; we fixed @xmath72 at 5 and examined two extreme cases for black hole spin , 0 and 0.998 .    for better understanding the numerical results , we began by deriving approximate analytic solutions to the photon trajectory equations .",
    "we divided a jet into two distinct zones , the inner and outer regions , depending on the importance of the gravitational effects .",
    "one of such effects is that the photons emitted around a black hole are  scattered \" into a larger angle . in other words ,",
    "a distant observer can not see the innnermost portion of the jet ( to within a critical radius @xmath74 ) .",
    "physically , photons are of @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) for @xmath77 . under these conditions eq .",
    "( 5 ) can be solved analytically for approaching jets . substituting @xmath61 with @xmath78 in the equation , we have @xmath79 for kerr black holes , and @xmath80 for schwarzschild black holes , where @xmath70 defines a critical viewing angle ( with respect to the jet axis ) .",
    "fig 1 . shows the results graphically .",
    "it is interesting to note that since we are probably looking down the jet in a bl lac object we would not be able to probe its inner most region . for @xmath81",
    ", it follows from eqs ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) that @xmath82 where @xmath83 , and @xmath74 is given by eq ( 18 ) .",
    "this is the cutoff photon energy for the inner region .    in the outer region ,",
    "the gravitational effects are weak and the special relativistic effects are dominant in determining line profiles . ignoring the general relativistic effects , @xmath84 becomes @xmath85 in eq ( 6 ) and eq ( 5 ) can be solved analytically @xmath86 where @xmath43 is the radial velocity of the jets .",
    "this is the well - known doppler shift formula .    for receding jets , on the other hand ,",
    "there is no @xmath65 cutoff ( see figs 4 and 5 ) with exception of the event horizon .",
    "therefore , the receding jets might allow us to probe deeper into the vicinity of a black hole .",
    "for both stellar - mass black holes and agn , however , the innermost region of a receding jet is likely obscured by the accretion disk , unless the system is viewed nearly edge on .",
    "besides , doppler de - boosting makes the receding jet much fainter than the approaching jet .",
    "we then derived numerically photon trajectories around a maximally rotating black hole . for approaching jets ,",
    "the results are shown in figures 2 and 3 for two jet velocity profiles .",
    "the two cases are quite similar .",
    "specifically , the results clearly show a cutoff in @xmath65 ; the critical radius ( @xmath74 derived is in rough agreement with our crude estimation ( see eq .",
    "18 ) . in the outer region",
    ", we see that @xmath87 , which again agrees with our analytic results [ see eq . ( 20 ) ] .",
    "2b shows that that @xmath26 is a single - valued function of @xmath61 for small viewing angles but becomes double - valued for large viewing angles .",
    "this is very important for evaluating the integral in eq .",
    "9 .    for receding jets ,",
    "the photon trajectories are more complicated . in this case , there are actually two possible trajectories for a given photon ( see figures 4 and 5 ) . in other words , the photons emitted with the same energy from the same location could be observed at different times because of the different trajectories they take .",
    "this is purely a general relativistic effect .",
    "we believe that the effect might become observable if the detectors have high enough timing resolution ( yuan & wang 2000 , in preparation ) .",
    "we also note that the intersection points in figures 4a and 5a indicate that the photons with the same @xmath65 at the same location @xmath88 may even be observed at two different viewing angles .",
    "the profile of an emission line is clearly affected both by the general and special relativistic effects , which include light bending , gravitational redshift , and doppler effects .",
    "moreover , it also depends on the emissivity law and velocity distribution of the jet .",
    "3.2.1 _ dependence on viewing angles _    we computed line profiles for different viewing angles , and the results are shown in the figures 6 , 7 and 8 .",
    "in general , the profiles are quite different from those of the emission lines originating in the accretion disk ( fabian et al 1989 , laor 1991 , kojima 1991 , matt et al 1993 , cadez , fanton & calvani 1998 , pariel & bromley 1998 , hartnoll & blackman 1999 ) .    for approaching jets around a maximally rotating hole ( @xmath89 ) ,",
    "the line profile is singly peaked for small viewing angles .",
    "the position of the peak ( peak i ) is simply determined by doppler blueshift . toward lower energies , the line is broadened to form a red tail due to gravitational redshift .",
    "as the viewing angle increases , the line profile becomes more complicated .",
    "it is in general similar to that of emission lines from a single ring surrounding the black hole ( gerbal & pelat 1981 , fang & deng 1982 , zhang , xiang & lu 1985 ) , but the two cases are different in nature .",
    "the profile is now doubly peaked , with the second peak ( peak ii ) caused by the combination of gravitational light bending and doppler effects in the inner region of the jet .",
    "more specifically , the photons emitted with a viewing angle @xmath90 less than @xmath70 would not arrive at a distant observer in the absence of light bending but would if they are scattered into a larger angle @xmath91 , which is equal to @xmath92 .",
    "now , the energy of the photons are @xmath93 , which is greater than @xmath94 ( without light bending ) , where @xmath0 is the gravitational redshift , and @xmath95 .",
    "this is the origin of a doubly - peaked line profile . given that the gravitational effects become weaker along the jet farther away from the black hole , it is clear that peak i ( pure doppler peak ) is mostly associated with the photons emitted in the outer region while peak ii with the inner region .",
    "quantitatively , the position of peak ii is derived from @xmath96 ( see eq . ( 4 ) ) , it follows from equation ( 9 ) , @xmath97 where @xmath98\\right\\}.\\ ] ] note that the equations can be much simplified for the case of jets with constant velocity . combining equations ( 3 ) and ( 21 )",
    ", we can quantify the dividing line ( @xmath99 ) between the inner and outer regions . as an example",
    ", we show the results in fig .  9 for the case of @xmath100 .",
    "the position of peak ii is then given by @xmath101 $ ] , which is computed at @xmath99 .    because @xmath26 is a double - valued function of @xmath61 for large viewing angles , the observed photons with the same energy may originate from different physical locations .",
    "we computed the time - averaged flux for each component .",
    "the individual components are also shown in figures 6 , 7 , and 8 in dotted lines .",
    "a more detailed study of the relationship between the two components , such as time lags , is beyond the scope of this investigation .    for receding jets ,",
    "the line profile is also composed of two components due to two different photon trajectories . at small viewing angles , because the two trajectories are similar , as shown in figures 4 and 5 , the line profile is singly peaked . as the viewing angle increases , the difference in the photon trajectories becomes more prominent , which results in a very complicated line profile , as shown in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "the profile now contains four distinct peaks !",
    "3.2.2 _ dependence on black hole spin _    we illustrate the dependence of line profiles on black hole spin by comparing figures 6 and 7 , which show the results for the cases of an extreme kerr black hole and a schwarzschild black hole , respectively . in the latter case , the profile of an emission line from approaching jets is _ always _ singly peaked for any viewing angles .",
    "the difference between the two cases can be attributed to our explicit assumption about the starting position of the jets , i.e. , at the marginally stable orbit @xmath102 . in this context",
    ", the inner region of the jets extends closer to a more rapidly rotating black hole , and thus the gravitational effects are stronger . to quantify the discussion",
    ", we plotted three important quantities , @xmath102 , @xmath74 , and @xmath99 , as a function of black hole spin in fig .",
    "9 , since the critical radius @xmath74 is strongly dependent of the viewing angle , we only show a case where the viewing angle is @xmath103 .",
    "it is clear that for schwarzschild black holes @xmath99 is always less than @xmath102 and thus peak ii never forms .    for receding jets",
    ", however , the line profile for the case of schwarzschild black holes is quite similar to that for the case of extreme kerr black holes .",
    "the reason is simple : there is no critical radius ( @xmath99 ) involved here .",
    "the rotation of black holes only strengthens the gravitational effects .",
    "3.2.3 _ dependence on jet velocity profile _",
    "we also investigated the dependence of line profiles on jet velocity profile . comparing the two cases shown in figures 6 and 8",
    ", we see quite similar results .",
    "there are , however , some differences worth noting .",
    "first , there is a discontinuity in the line profiles for cases where a jet has a constant velocity , but none where the jet has an accelerating velocity profile .",
    "this is caused by the boundary conditions imposed at the starting point of the jet .",
    "the reason is simple : the doppler effect ( dominates over redshift ) bluesfits the line at the starting point if the jet has constant velocity .",
    "second , the line profiles are steeper on the red side for cases where a jet has a constant velocity , while they are steeper on the blue side where the jet has an accelerating velocity profile . in the latter cases , continuous acceleration leads to a continuous superimposition of different doppler shifts , which makes the blue side steeper .",
    "we further explored the parameter space to investigate in detail how the line profiles depend on the accelerating factor @xmath71 . in fig .",
    "10 , we summarize the results for different @xmath71 values and for both approaching and receding jets .",
    "it is clear that the line profiles become markedly different at large @xmath71 for approaching jets and they are not nearly as sensitive to @xmath71 for receding jets .",
    "3.2.4 _ dependence on emissivity law _",
    "similarly , we studied the dependence of the line profiles on the power - law index ( @xmath69 ) of the assumed emissivity law for the jets .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "11 . as @xmath69 increases",
    ", the inner region of the jets contributes more and more to the line emission .",
    "therefore , we expect that peak i becomes weaker and weaker and eventually disappear at very large @xmath69 ; this is indeed the case .",
    "given that we know little about the emissivity law of astrophysical jets , we chose to cover a large enough parameter space for completeness .",
    "in this work , we conducted a detailed study of the profile of an emission line from both approaching and receding jets .",
    "the combinations of strong gravitational effects ( including gravitational redshift and gravitational light bending ) and doppler effects can significantly alter the intrinsic profile of the line .",
    "we found that the observed line profiles are also dependent of such factors as the viewing angle , the velocity profile of the jets , and the emissivity law of the jets .",
    "we summarize our main results as follows :    * for approaching jets , the emission line is predominantly doppler blueshifted at small viewing angles .",
    "the line profile is singly peaked and is broadened toward lower energies due to gravitational redshift . at sufficiently large viewing angles , however , the line profile becomes doubly peaked , with the second ( higher ) peak caused by gravitational light bending . for receding jets ,",
    "the line profile is even more complicated due to different possible photon trajectories .",
    "it can have four peaks .",
    "* we quantified the boundary between the inner and outer regions of a jet with which the two peaks in the line profiles are associated for approaching jets .",
    "* we derived a critical radius within which approaching jets become unobservable .",
    "this radius increases as the viewing angle decreases .",
    "therefore , it might be difficult to probe the innermost region of the jets in a bl lac object .",
    "such a constraint does not exist for receding jets .",
    "* we found that the line profile is sensitive to the intrinsic properties of a black hole jet system , such as the spin of the black hole , the lorentz factor of the jets , the velocity profile of the jets , and the emissivity law of the jets , as well as to external factors such as the viewing angle .",
    "observationally , although evidence exists for the presence of emission lines from jets both in galactic black hole systems and agn , the quality of data is not sufficient for obtaining the line profiles .",
    "therefore , applying our results to observational data is still difficult .",
    "besides , our study makes several critical assumptions about the properties of jets , such as their velocity profile and emissivity law , which are not understood .",
    "this makes direct comparisons with observations even harder .",
    "fortunately , new x - ray missions , such as _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ , now carry instruments that provide unprecedended spectral resolution and sensitivity . hopefully , the new data is of sufficiently good quality that allows us to identify emission lines from jets in galactic black hole systems and agn , based on this work .",
    "a detailed characterization of such lines might lead to a determination of such fundamental properties as the angular momentum of the black holes and perhaps shed significant light on the properties of the jets themselves .",
