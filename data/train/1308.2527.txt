    "the birefringent pcf source used in this experiment is similar to that described in @xcite , using a cross - polar phase matching scheme such that pump light polarized on the slow axis of the fibre produces signal and idler photons polarized on the fast axis through four wave mixing ( fwm ) .",
    "the phase matching curve has a turning point in the signal wavelength , at which the signal spectrum is not correlated with that of the pump or idler .",
    "hence when the fibre is pumped with picosecond pulses at 720  nm ( produced from a _ spectra - physics _",
    "tsunami ti : sapphire laser ) the joint spectrum of the signal and idler at 625  nm and 860  nm should be free of correlation , resulting in the photons being detected in a pure quantum state without the need for tight filtering and the associated loss .    in order to see classical interference in the sagnac interferometer ,",
    "a half wave plate ( hwp ) at @xmath65 was inserted in the space labelled a in fig .",
    "[ setup ] . hence the counter - clockwise propagating pump light was rotated from vertical to horizontal polarization before it reached the variable birefringence , accumulating a phase @xmath66 , while the clockwise propagating light was still vertically polarized and experienced a phase @xmath67 . when the two paths crossed at the beamsplitter ( bs ) again , they had both been rotated to horizontal , and interfered with a relative phase given by @xmath68 , which could be varied with the position of the soleil - babinet compensator ( s - b ) .",
    "the bs used was an ultra broadband ( 600 - 900  nm ) cube from _ laser 2000 _ @xcite with a close to 50:50 splitting ratio for all the wavelengths used .    for the multiphoton interference measurements the hwp was removed from the loop , as the polarization rotation was effectively performed by the cross - polar phasematching , taking vertically polarized pump light to horizontally polarized signal and idler .",
    "counter clockwise propagating pump light produced correlated signal and idler photons in the pcf which then reached the s - b and accumulated a total phase @xmath69 .",
    "clockwise propagating pump experienced a phase @xmath67 , which then was transferred to signal - idler pairs produced in the pcf with a factor of 2 due to the quadratic dependence of fwm on the pump field , @xmath70 .",
    "this leaves a total phase between pairs produced in separate paths @xmath71 , where we have assumed that @xmath72 , which is true unless the dispersion in the s - b is extreme .",
    "so the two photon curves will have half the fringe spacing of classical interference with the pump laser .",
    "initially , the visibility of the two photon interference was limited by chromatic dispersion in the s - b , which caused counter - clockwise signal and idler pulses to walk - off from the accompanying pump pulse , and so arrive at the bs at a slightly different time to the signal and idler from the other direction , which did not experience this effect . in order to re - balance these arrival times , a second identical s - b was inserted into position a. this was kept at a fixed position while the phase was varied with the first s - b .",

[ fringes2 ] ) reveals slight phase offsets between fringes , for instance between the counts for a signal and idler photon both exiting output 1 compared to both exiting output 2 , which ideally would be exactly in phase .",
    "this can be explained by modelling the beamsplitter operation for an individual photon as a hadamard matrix @xmath74 which is only unitary if @xmath75 . from the observed curves , at the signal wavelength @xmath76 0.26  rad and at the idler wavelength @xmath77 -0.04  rad .",
    "this departure from unitary behaviour is possible if there is sufficient loss @xmath78 in the operation @xcite : @xmath79 hence a value of 0.26  rad requires a loss @xmath80 .",
    "the loss at the beamsplitter at 635  nm measured with a bright laser is 12.4@xmath81 .",
    "the fact that the effect is much larger at the signal wavelength than the idler suggests it is a wavelength dependent property of the broadband beamsplitter , and that the problem could be avoided by using a smaller wavelength separation between signal and idler .",
    "the values of @xmath82 can significantly affect the form of the four and six photon fringes , so the measured values from the two photon data were incorporated into the theory lines .",
    "for a single fwm source pumped by a bright coherent laser , the nonlinear hamiltonian can be written as @xmath83 where the first term can spontaneously generate a signal - idler pair , and the second term represents the reverse process , which removes pairs .",
    "the constant g is a function of the pump power and the nonlinearity of the medium .",
    "when the generation rate is low , the reverse process is unlikely to occur and this term can be neglected , so that a propagator can be written as @xmath84 where the constants relating to the generation rate have been grouped into @xmath85 for brevity , with @xmath86 the interaction time . applying this propagator to an initial vacuum state for the signal and idler modes ,",
    "the output state is @xmath87 so that , with identical sources in each arm of the interferometer , any integer combination of @xmath35 and @xmath88 pairs produced in each arm can occur with amplitude @xmath89 . for @xmath62 signal and @xmath62 idler photons detected ,",
    "they are equally likely to have come from any distribution of @xmath62 pairs between the two arms , so the wavefunction for @xmath23 photons can be written as : @xmath56 in this respect , these states differ from holland - burnett states , which are weighted slightly towards the wings of the distribution , as in fig .",

    "this results in simple expressions for the operator @xmath90 and @xmath91 , with @xmath92 and @xmath93 the uncertainty in the signal photon number is given by @xmath94 using @xmath95 we have @xmath96 resulting in a minimum uncertainty in @xmath12 given by @xmath63    importantly for the higher order states , the photon statistics depend on whether the signal photons from separate pairs are distinguishable from each other and whether the idler photons are distinguishable from each other .",
    "for instance strong spectral correlations between the signal and idler of a pair can introduce distinguishability . in the extreme case",
    "where each photon is completely distinguishable from every other photon , we would expect the output of a single fwm source to produce pairs with poisson likelihood , such that the generation of one signal - idler pair does not affect the chance of generating another .",
    "the flat distribution in fig .",
    "[ probs ] then becomes a binomial distribution of pairs - ie .",
    "it is still only even terms which are occupied , but there would now be a weighting towards the centre of the distribution .",
    "@xmath97 becomes @xmath98 and @xmath44 can only scale a fixed factor of @xmath30 below the sql .",
    "hence no further improvement in resolution is seen for higher photon number states , beyond the initial factor of @xmath30 for the two photon state .",
    "for the theoretical fit lines used in the results , we began by deriving the output states from the @xmath61 states , representing the final beamsplitter operation as a hadamard operation on the field operators such that @xmath99 and @xmath100 , with @xmath101 a creation operator for the sample arm of the interferometer , and @xmath102 for the signal and idler modes .",
    "these were then modified to account for the non - unitary beamsplitter , with @xmath103 , and the probabilities were used to give the form of the fit lines .",
    "a flat background was included as a free parameter .",
    "from @xmath108 we can see that the output state will oscillate between being in one of two ` bunched ' states where signal and idler are in the same output with probability @xmath109 , and two ` anti - bunched states ' with probability @xmath110 .",
    "when @xmath111 , these fringes are shifted such that @xmath112=1/2~cos^2\\theta\\\\ p[(1,0)_s(0,1)_i]=1/2~sin^2(\\theta-\\delta_i/2)\\\\ p[(0,1)_s(1,0)_i]=1/2~sin^2(\\theta-\\delta_s/2)\\\\ p[(0,1)_s(0,1)_i]=1/2~cos^2(\\theta-\\delta_s/2-\\delta_i/2 ) \\end{array}\\ ] ] as can be seen experimentally in fig .",

    "<S> this is an advantage over implementations involving hom interference to produce entanglement , though in our experiment it is necessary to avoid spectral correlations in order to see any additional improvement from using higher photon number states ( see appendix c ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the two photon detections also suggest that the beamsplitter is acting as a non - unitary operation at the signal wavelength , resulting in some additional phase shifts between interfering terms ( see appendix b ) . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath46 bears more similarity to a holland - burnett state @xcite . in ideal conditions </S>",
    "<S> holland - burnett states show sensitivity above the sql but below that of a noon state , and are an attractive route to entanglement enhanced metrology because they are simple to generate for arbitary @xmath3 and show a better tolerance to photon loss .     </S>",

    "<S> the fringes in fig  [ fringes3 ] ( a ) and ( b ) are approximately sinusoidal with 1/4 the period of the classical fringe , a characteristic of a four photon noon state . </S>",
    "<S> this is because hom interference acts on the middle term in @xmath46 and causes the signal photons to bunch together after the final beamsplitter , so that if the two signal photons are detected at separate outputs , they must have come from one of the other two components of the state , which together resemble a noon state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the same argument applies to detecting the two idler photons at separate outputs , so that any detection pattern involving like photons at separate outputs is expected to show sinusoidal interference with four fold super - resolution . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , for detection patterns with both signals at the same output and both idlers at the same output , the middle term will have an increased effect due to bunching . as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fringes3](c ) , the effect is a curve with two - fold super - resolution , with some flattening at the minima and sharpening at the maxima due to the presence of a four fold component . </S>",
    "<S> this curve is more tolerant to loss , as can be seen from its high visibility compared to ( a ) and ( b ) , which is expected for interference using a holland - burnett like state . </S>",
    "<S> note that the @xmath47 fringe in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fringes3](b ) corresponds directly to the @xmath49 output in the one colour case @xcite , and similarly it can still show four fold super - resolution with full visibility if separate photon pairs are distinguishable and act independently , in which case the state would be described by @xmath50 rather than @xmath46 . however , the @xmath51 fringe in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fringes3](a ) does not have an analogue in one colour experiments , and if multi - photon interference did not take place between signals from separate pairs ( or idlers from separate pairs ) the visibility would be limited to @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> hence this fringe acts as a test of multiphoton interference taking place and demonstrates that the four photon state can show improved sensitivity compared to multiple two photon states .    </S>",
    "<S> we have measured fringes in only three out of the nine possible detection patterns for @xmath46 - after the beamsplitter operation , the signal photons can be detected in three states , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , or @xmath55 , which are multiplied by the same three possibilities for the idler photons - but it is in principle possible to monitor all output states simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> this would clearly allow better sensitivity since all the output states provide information about the phase . </S>",
    "<S> as described in @xcite , when calculating the sensitivities from individual fringes , the visibility and the intrinsic detection efficiency of the fringe should be taken into account , as well as its gradient . for the fringes in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fringes3](a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) , we find values for @xmath44 of 1.18 , 1.82 , and 1.75 respectively , relative to the sql . </S>",
    "<S> no individual fringe beats the sql , due to the non - unit visibilities , and because the state is divided between more potential detection patterns than in the single colour case . </S>",
    "<S> however , adding the fisher information @xcite from separate fringes suggests they would allow an improvement if they were monitored simultaneously . since of the six outputs we did not measure we expect three to be of the same form as ( b ) and three the same form as ( c ) , we can estimate that monitoring all nine outputs would give a minimum uncertainty 0.72 of the sql . </S>",
    "<S> this would be a significant improvement over the sql , though it is still above the theoretical value from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cr ] for @xmath46 of 0.61 due to the non - unit visibilities , and above the heisenberg limit for four photons of 0.5 .    </S>",
    "<S> a general wavefunction for m photons of two colours can be written as @xmath56 for example m=6 leads to @xmath57 as shown in appendix c. figure  [ fringes4 ] shows an example of @xmath58 with the detection pattern @xmath59 , which is expected to contain oscillation at both two and six times the classical frequency . </S>",
    "<S> multiphoton interference again plays a part - if separate photon pairs were distinguishable , only two - fold oscillation would remain . </S>",
    "<S> the data is in good agreement with theory , though there is a high level of background noise from higher - order emission due to the high pump power used and the low count rate . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the data taken does not achieve the @xmath60 visibility required to exceed the sql , however improvements in the level and balancing of collection and detection efficiencies would bring us towards this goal .     </S>",
    "<S> output with a fit line based on theory . ]    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath61 is an equally weighted superposition of all distributions of @xmath62 signal - idler pairs between the two paths , with each path necessarily containing equal numbers of signal and idler photons . </S>",
    "<S> this results in simple expressions for eq . 2 and 3 ( see appendix c ) , leading to a minimum uncertainty in @xmath12 given by @xmath63 hence for a general two colour entangled state the shot noise will scale below the sql by a factor @xmath64 , potentially achieving significant improvements at large @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> with current technology , detecting large numbers of coincident photons is impractical due to the relatively low efficiency of single photon detectors , and the improved sensitivity of the state drops rapidly with any form of loss including imperfect detectors . </S>",
    "<S> although an analysis of loss tolerance is beyond the scope of this work , the similarity of these states to holland - burnett states suggests that they will fare better than noon states . also note that the states are generated spontaneously by the source , so that it is not possible to obtain a high sensitivity @xmath23 photon entangled state on demand . </S>",
    "<S> rather we expect that in a low loss setting , increasing the pair generation rate of the source will improve sensitivity as more high-@xmath23 states occur , unlike the current situation where a higher generation rate tends to add noise to the results .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion we have shown that two colour entangled states could be a useful resource for quantum metrology and demonstrated these effects up to six photon states in a novel ultra - stable interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> we have seen that single photon interference _ and _ multiphoton interference combine to increase the visibility of fringes at the four and six photon level , and ultimately lead to improved sensitivity . when lumped losses are reduced giving access to entangled states consisting of larger numbers of photons , the simplicity of this path - entangled pair photon source and its improved sensitivity to path - length make it a promising approach to future quantum metrology and enhanced sensing .    </S>",
