    "theoretical population synthesis models based on _ solar _ abundance ratios predict  for a given fe index  stronger mg indices than measured in bright elliptical galaxies ( e.g.  worthey , faber & gonzlez 1992 , davies , sadler & peletier 1993 ) .",
    "this result is generally interpreted such that the stellar populations hosted by these objects are @xmath0-enhanced with respect to solar values .    in this paper",
    "i discuss different formation scenarios for early - type galaxies and seek under which conditions the observed [ mg / fe ] overabundance can be achieved .",
    "\\1 ) a _ fast clumpy collapse _ is characterized by short star formation time - scales and implies that ellipticals have formed early at high redshifts .",
    "this picture is observationally supported by the tightness of the fundamental plane relations ( dressler et  al .",
    "1987 , renzini & ciotti 1993 ) .",
    "also the modest color evolution ( aragn salamanca et  al .  1993 ) and the evolution of the mg-@xmath1 relation with redshift ( bender , ziegler & bruzual 1996 , ziegler & bender ) push the formation ages of cluster ellipticals to high redshift ( @xmath2 ) . a clumpy collapse in the framework of hierarchical structure formation can also be considered as a refinement of the classical monolithic collapse ( e.g.  matteucci 1994 ) .",
    "\\2 ) the scenario in which an elliptical is the outcome of two _ merging spirals _ , instead , emphasizes the relevancy of the merger process . indeed , there are observational indications that merging must play an important role for the formation of early - type galaxies , since roughly 50 per cent of bright ellipticals host kinematically decoupled cores ( bender 1996 ) .",
    "\\3 ) the above models can be considered as two extreme cases of substantially distinct formation scenarios . as a third option",
    "i discuss semi - analytic models of hierarchical clustering , which describe galaxy formation in a cosmological context ( kauffmann , white & guiderdoni 1993 , cole et  al.1994 ) . a priori , in a bottom - up scenario the star formation history of a large object",
    "is expected to be rather extended .",
    "hence , the question arises if these kind of models are compatible with [ mg / fe ] overabundance in luminous ellipticals ( bender 1997 ) .",
    "this issue is investigated here .",
    "the basic constraints on the modeling , aimed to describe the stellar populations in the central parts of bright ellipticals , are : ( 1 ) achieving high ( super - solar ) total metallicities ( @xmath3 ) , ( 2 ) producing an @xmath0-enhancement  of the order of [ @xmath0/fe]@xmath4 0.20.4 dex , as implied by the observations .",
    "the first requirement comes from the observed nuclear mg@xmath5 index and points towards either higher yields ( i.e.  shallow imf ) in the central regions or to a scenario of _ enriched _ inflow ( edmunds 1990 , greggio 1997 ) .",
    "the latter implies that the composite stellar populations ( csps ) inhabiting the nuclear regions of ellipticals are characterized by a metallicity distribution with a minimum metallicity @xmath6 .",
    "for the _ fast clumpy collapse _ and the _ merging spirals _ i will show the results for @xmath7 .",
    "the second requirement constraints short time - scales or flatter imf slopes , both possibilities shall be discussed here .",
    "the suggestions of lowering the sn  ia rate with respect to our galaxy and selective mass loss mechanisms , instead , are not explicitly considered in this paper .    in the models of the sections  [ fcc ] and  [ ms ] a normalized amount of gas",
    "is used up and transformed into stars within the star formation time - scale @xmath8 .",
    "the rate of star formation is kept constant . for details of the modeling",
    "i refer the reader to thomas , greggio & bender ( 1998a , 1998b ) .      on rather short time - scales ( @xmath9 gyr )",
    ", massive objects are built up by merging of smaller entities .",
    "star formation takes place within these entities , on a larger scale , however , the whole system participates in a general collapse .",
    "[ fig : fcc ] gives the @xmath10-light averaged mg / fe ratio in the stars for a family of models with different star formation time - scales .",
    "the entire closed - box population with @xmath11 ( dotted line ) and the extracted metal - rich csp with @xmath12 ( solid line ) are shown .",
    "the result basically demonstrates that time - scales up to 1  gyr yield significant @xmath0-enhancementfor a salpeter imf slope ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the segregation of the metal - rich population lowers @xmath14}\\rangle_{\\rm v}}$ ] by less than @xmath15 dex , but increases the metallicity of the csp by @xmath16 dex ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fcc ] , see thomas et  al .",
    "a flattening of the imf ( @xmath17 ) naturally allows for longer time - scales , and in this case the cut - off at @xmath12 has no significant effect on mg / fe .      in this scenario",
    "i assume that the merger occurs when the two parent spirals have converted a substantial fraction of gas into stars ( i.e.  two ` milky ways ' ) .",
    "hence , most of the stars in the merging entities have formed in a continuous and long lasting ( @xmath4 10 gyr ) star formation process , leading to approximately solar abundance ratios . at merging , the ( enriched ) residual",
    "gas flows down to the center ( barnes & hernquist 1996 ) , where it experiences a violent episode of star formation in which the central population ( considered here ) forms on a short burst time - scale .",
    "note that the global formation process , however , lasts @xmath4 10 gyr or more .",
    "the minimum metallicity of the newly formed stars is solar by construction .    for a family of different burst time - scales ,",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ms ] with salpeter and flat imf _ during the burst_. due to the huge amount of fe created in the parent disk galaxy evolution before the merger , it is now impossible to form significantly @xmath0-enhanced csps with salpeter imf ( @xmath13 ) , independent of the burst time - scale . in this case ,",
    "a flattening of the imf ( @xmath17 ) is required .",
    "semi - analytic models of hierarchical clustering can be placed between the two extreme cases discussed above . in these simulations structures",
    "are subsequently built up starting from small disk - like objects .",
    "an elliptical is formed when two disk galaxies of comparable mass merge .",
    "it is important to emphasize , that the bulk of stars forms at modest rates during disk galaxy evolution _ before _ this ` major merger ' event ( kauffmann 1996 , baugh , cole & frenk 1996 ) .    to follow the chemical evolution of such models during the entire formation history , i adopt the star formation history of the _ average _ cluster elliptical from kauffmann ( 1996 ) .",
    "further details are described in thomas ( 1998 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : k96 ] the fractional contribution of the stars to the total @xmath10-band luminosity of the object is indicated by the solid line ( plus signs show the contribution to the total _ mass _ ) .",
    "the @xmath10-luminosity weighted average mg / fe ratio of the respective composite stellar population is indicated by the diamonds for salpeter imf ( @xmath13 ) and by the triangles for the flat case ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "although exhibiting overabundant mg / fe ratios at the early stages of the evolution ( i.e.  the first @xmath18 gyr ) , @xmath14}\\rangle_{\\rm v}}$ ] decreases with time and saturates at a roughly solar level after @xmath19  gyr .",
    "* the star formation history of the average elliptical as provided by hierarchical models does not lead to @xmath0-enhancement , unless the imf is significantly flattened . *    in the kauffmann ( 1996 ) models , the stellar populations of bright _ cluster _ ellipticals exhibit ages around @xmath20  gyr , and are consequently somewhat older than the average elliptical with an age of @xmath21  gyr .",
    "this implies a star formation history which is more skewed towards early times and therefore yields higher , probably super - solar mg / fe ratios .",
    "note that , given their short formation times ( @xmath18  gyr ) , bright cluster ellipticals form in a scenario which appears similar to the _ fast clumpy collapse_. the stellar populations of bright _ field _ ellipticals , instead , are predicted by the models to be younger by roughly 5  gyr ( kauffmann 1996 ) .",
    "these objects should therefore  owing to the more extended star formation history ",
    "exhibit significantly smaller mg / fe ratios than their counterparts in clusters .",
    "( a ) : :    the two distinct formation scenarios , _ fast clumpy collapse _ and    _ merging spirals _ , yield significantly different abundance ratios .",
    "( b ) : :    in contrast to the fast clumpy collapse scenario , the late merger of    two spirals yields @xmath0-enhanced populations , only if    a shallow imf is assumed .",
    "( c ) : :    the star formation history of the average elliptical as specified by    _ hierarchical clustering _",
    "models leads to solar abundance ratios .",
    "( d ) : :    such models predict significantly higher mg / fe ratios in bright    _ cluster _ ellipticals than in bright _ field _ ellipticals .",
    "d.  thomas the theoretical yields from type  ii supernovae are still affected by many uncertainties , particularly magnesium and iron . as a consequence ,",
    "conclusions from chemical evolution models are principally weakened . however , the model and the nucleosynthesis can and should be calibrated on the chemical evolution of the solar neighborhood .",
    "i am using the yields from thielemann , nomoto & hashimoto ( 1996 ) , since they lead to the best reproduction of the abundance patterns in our galaxy .",
    "r.  bower in what you discussed , you used a closed box model for chemical evolution .",
    "but in the hierarchical galaxy formation models , the inflow and outflow of gas are extremely important .",
    "how does this affect your conclusions ?",
    "d.  thomas in case of hierarchical clustering models , i only discussed abundance _ ratios _ of elements with no primordial origin . as long as selective loss mechanisms etc .",
    "play a minor role , my conclusions on the mg / fe ratio are not affected .",
    "but i agree that a more detailed study of chemical enrichment in the hierarchical models is necessary to enable more reliable quantitative statements on abundance ratios .",
