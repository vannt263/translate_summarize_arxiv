    "the hm model may be extended to include the collisional aspect of the drift waves by not neglecting the electron motion along the magnetic field line so that linearly unstable modes are present self - consistently and that the energy is transferred to locally adjacent scale and is eventually dissipated at small scale @xcite . such collisional drift wave ( cdw ) description of the plasma",

    "however , the fluctuations of the cdw model that are close to the adiabatic state are very slow to reach a saturation numerically .    instead of dealing with the self - consistent cdw model in assessing the non - adiabatic effect on the transport one may choose to approach conceptually similarly to the th equation but more realistically by introducing a simulated noise that represents energy pumping of the linearly unstable cdw s . as cdw s",

    "specifically we assume that the noise is gaussian with the spectrum of power - law type that is widely used in the renormalization - group ( rg ) approach to turbulence @xcite .",
    "the noise is assumed to be short - correlated in time compared with typical time scale of the plasma fluctuations as well as reflection non - invariant or parity non - conserving ( pnc ) along a direction @xmath0 as a symmetry breaking element .",

    "it is clear that such anisotropic nature of @xmath76 is the result of the nonlinear interactions between the drift waves and the pnc noise is not relevant to @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "since the hasegawa - mima dynamics has an intrinsic direction of @xmath77 due to the gradient of the plasma density along @xmath78 , it is understandable for isotropic forcing that @xmath56 has odd parity under the reflection along @xmath77 leading @xmath68 to vanish while leaving @xmath75 finite .",
    "it may be concluded that the turbulent flux induced by the pnc noise is predominantly along the perpendicular direction to @xmath0 , that is @xmath78 in the present setup .    since @xmath79 in the left - hand plane @xmath80 is equal to @xmath81 , @xmath82 suggests advective nature along the direction of @xmath78 , perpendicular to the pnc direction . upon anticipating @xmath83 to be advective with the velocity @xmath84 , an advective flux @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the vorticity @xmath87 , in the right - half plane is laid over @xmath88 in fig .",

    "[ fig5 ] @xmath68 for the cases of @xmath91 and 0.3 are overlaid with @xmath102 where the advecting velocity is @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively .",

    "( [ hme ] ) may result in the advective response . with the pnc direction along @xmath105 , regarding the transport of the second - order moment like the energy and the enstrophy , one may approximate eq .",
    "( [ hme ] ) as @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 is the parity - conserving part of the noise .",
    "motivated by observations that the fluctuations in the magnetic fusion devices are predominantly anisotropic as attested by the presence of various types of the drift waves , we set out to pedagogically study the advective characteristics of the turbulent transport . in this paper",
    "we simulate the dynamics of the electrostatic fluctuations in a magnetized plasma modeled by hasegawa - mima equation that is driven by an anisotropic noise .",
    "the noise is not reflection - invariant along the direction @xmath0 .",
    "such noise is simulated numerically by considering , for each mode , two random variables that have time - delayed correlation to each other for a short time in a time - ordered fashion .    to be specific the electrostatic fluctuations are considered to be driven by the noise in the uv scale so that the plasma energy cascades toward smaller scale . in the region of the fourier space @xmath3",
    "where the energy flux is nearly constant owing to the uv noise power it is found that the imaginary part of the turbulent flux @xmath109 is advective . with the case of @xmath110 , the advective flux @xmath111 along the direction @xmath77 is arguably due to the strong interactions of the drift waves based on the fact that @xmath111 is mostly independent of the pnc noise .",
    "however , the advective flux @xmath112 along the direction @xmath78 arises because of the pnc noise .",
    "the advecting velocity @xmath89 along @xmath78 is found to be proportional both to @xmath2 and to the strength of the parity - non - conserving noise .",
    "such dependence is shown to hold in a wide range of @xmath38 , including @xmath113 , as long as the plasma is forced from a uv region .",
    "the @xmath90 dependence of @xmath89 is in accordance with the strongly magnetized mhd plasma forced by a pnc noise .",
    "as it is clear that the pnc noise may lead to the non - diffusive transport in the plasma , it is desirable to look into the presence of pnc properties in the turbulent plasmas .",
    "work in such a direction is under way and results will be presented in another publication .",
