    "over the past decade significant progress has been made in constructing space - time codes that achieve the optimal rate - diversity trade - off for _ flat - fading _ channels when there are transmit alphabet constraints @xcite .",
    "far less attention has been given to space - time code design and analysis for fading channels with memory , _",
    "i.e. , _ inter - symbol interference ( isi ) channels which are encountered in broadband multiple antenna communications . there have been several constructions of space - time codes for fading isi channels using multi - carrier techniques ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , since these inherently increase the transmit alphabet size , and the right framework to study such constructions is through the _ diversity - multiplexing _ trade - off @xcite .",
    "we examined diversity embedded codes for isi channels in @xcite , by considering the diversity - multiplexing trade - off .",
    "as in space - time code design for flat - fading channels , it is natural to ask for a characterization of the rate - diversity trade - off for isi channels with transmit alphabet constraints .",
    "therefore this imposes a maximal rate of @xmath0 bits and we normalize the rate by @xmath1 and state the rate in terms of a number in @xmath2 $ ] symbols per transmission . ] . the problem of constructing space - time codes with fixed transmit alphabet constraints is partially motivated by the need to control the transmit spectrum as well as the peak - to - average ( par ) ratio of the transmitted signal .",
    "for example , if we restrict transmission to psk alphabet , it is clear that we have a unit peak - to - average ratio ( par ) making it possible to use efficient non - linear amplifiers ( requiring small par ) , which are more efficient and hence suitable for mobile devices .",
    "another important reason to consider this problem is a fundamental theoretical question , which is motivated by the origins of space - time codes for flat - fading channels in @xcite where the constructions were for fixed transmit alphabet . for this constraint",
    ", there exists a trade - off between rate and diversity , for the flat - fading case . in this paper",
    "we ask the corresponding question for fading isi channels .",
    "since space - time code design with diversity order guarantees requires control over the rank distance of the codewords @xcite , the main topic of this paper is to design codes with rank distance guarantees for isi channels .",
    "diversity embedded codes were introduced in @xcite which allowed different parts of a message to have different diversity order guarantees .",
    "these codes allowed diversity to be viewed as a systems resource that can be allocated judiciously to achieve a target rate - diversity trade - off in wireless communications . a class of such multi - level diversity embedded codes suitable for flat - fading channels was constructed in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend these constructions to isi channels .    the corresponding question , of what is studied in this paper , can be also be posed in the context of the trade - off between diversity and multiplexing rate .",
    "such an information - theoretic question , for the flat - fading case , has been posed and partially answered in @xcite . for scalar isi channels ,",
    "we have studied code designs for rate - growth ( multiplexing rate ) codes and the diversity embedding properties in @xcite .",
    "there we have shown that the diversity multiplexing trade - off for the scalar isi channel is actually successively refinable .",
    "however , the code designs and criteria for the rate - growth codes are quite different from those needed for the fixed rate , transmit alphabet constrained codes , which are the focus of this paper .    for the case of a scalar isi channel with @xmath3 taps and a single transmit antenna ,",
    "it can be shown by a simple argument ( see for example @xcite ) that an uncoded transmission scheme can achieve a diversity order of @xmath4 . the best case scenario for",
    "the rate - diversity trade - off for isi channels with multiple transmit antennas would be similar to the flat - fading case , but with a @xmath5fold increase in the diversity order .",
    "however , in the multiple transmit antenna case , it is not obvious that a space - time code designed for a flat - fading channel can achieve such a @xmath5fold increase in the diversity order .",
    "all that can be guaranteed is that a space - time code that achieves diversity order @xmath6 over a flat - fading channel will still achieve diversity order @xmath6 over a fading isi channel @xcite .",
    "in particular in example 1 of section [ sec : examples ] we provide an example of a code which achieves particular points on rate - diversity trade - off for flat - fading channels and fails to do so in the case of isi channels .",
    "therefore , the design of codes for fading isi channels can not be immediately done by using the codes for flat - fading channels . however , in this paper we see that codes designed for the fading isi channel can be used successfully to achieve the rate - diversity trade - off for the flat - fading case as well .",
    "a finite alphabet construction to exploit the potential diversity gain from isi channels with @xmath7 multiple transmit antennas was proposed in @xcite for the maximal diversity case .",
    "but the rate of the code for this construction was @xmath8 as opposed to the maximal potential rate of @xmath9 . in this paper",
    "we show that as the transmission block size increases we can construct codes that have rate @xmath9 and achieve the maximal diversity order of @xmath10 .",
    "we characterize the rate diversity tradeoff for the isi channels and construct codes which achieve this tradeoff ( asymptotically in block size ) .",
    "we build on the construction technique introduced in @xcite to design diversity embedded codes for isi channels that guarantee multiple reliability ( diversity ) levels .",
    "given that we can achieve a @xmath5fold increase in the diversity order for isi channels , this flexibility could be quite important .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are as follows .",
    "we extend the rate - diversity trade - off bound from @xcite and develop the diversity embedded code design criteria for fading isi channels in section [ sec : modelcd ] .",
    "the basic multi - level construction of diversity - embedded space - time code for fading isi channels is given in section [ sec : mlcons ] .",
    "we also show that this construction can be specialized to asymptotically achieve the diversity - rate trade - off for isi channels .",
    "the key ingredient is the construction of binary codes for isi channels with rank - distance guarantees , and this is done in section [ sec : rate ] and section [ sec : rank ] .",
    "this is perhaps the most important technical contribution of this paper .",
    "we also construct of convolutional codes suitable for transmission over the isi channel in section [ sec : trellis ] . in section [ sec : examples ] we give examples of codes constructed by the method given in the paper along with their numerical performance .",
    "in section [ subsec : chanmodel ] , we define the isi channel model . section [ subsec : stcode ] recalls the code design criteria for diversity embedded codes for flat - fading channels given in @xcite and extends it to the fading isi case .",
    "these criteria give the connection between embedded rank - distance codes and diversity - embedded space - time codes . the rate - diversity trade - off for flat - fading channels",
    "is reviewed in section [ subsec : ratediv ] , and a simple upper bound for the corresponding trade - off for the fading isi case is established .",
    "the subsections [ subsec : setpart ] and [ subsec : algprop ] are based on @xcite and reproduced here for completeness . in section [ subsec : setpart ] , we review the principle of set - partitioning and give algebraic properties of such partitions in section [ subsec : algprop ] .",
    "these properties would be useful in _ lifting _ rank properties of binary matrices over binary fields to the complex domain , thereby giving provable diversity embedded code constructions .",
    "our focus in this paper is on the quasi - static frequency selective ( isi ) channel with @xmath4 taps where we transmit information coded over @xmath7 transmit antennas and have @xmath11 antennas at the receiver .",
    "furthermore , we make the standard assumption that the transmitter has no channel state information , whereas the receiver is able to perfectly track the channel . the code is designed over a large enough block size @xmath12 transmission symbols , where @xmath13 is specified in the constructions given in section [ sec : mlcons ] .",

    "more formally ,    [ defn : div ] a coding scheme which has an average error probability @xmath38 as a function of @xmath39 that behaves as @xmath40 is said to have a diversity order of @xmath6 .",
    "the fact that the diversity order of a space - time code is determined by the rank of the codeword difference matrix is well known @xcite .",
    "therefore , for flat - fading channels , it has been shown that the diversity order achieved by a space - time code is given by @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 are the space - time codewords .",
    "clearly the analysis in @xcite can be easily extended to fading isi channels , and we can write @xmath43 where @xmath44 are matrices with structure given in ( [ eqn : model1 ] ) .",

    "<S> the key idea is to construct and analyze properties of binary matrices with a particular structure induced by isi channels . </S>"
