    "the generation of magnetic fields by dynamo activity plays an important role in a wide range of astrophysical objects , ranging from stars to clusters of galaxies .",
    "the gas in these objects is characterized by turbulent flows , as shown for instance by scintillation observations of the interstellar medium @xcite , or from pressure maps in galaxy clusters @xcite . mechanisms able to generate magnetic fields by dynamo action are often classified as large- and small - scale dynamos , depending on the correlation length of the induced magnetic field . in this context ,",
    "large and small are referred to the energy containing scale of the turbulent hydrodynamic flow .",
    "this classification is not rigid , as in many astrophysical objects both dynamos may be at work , but it gives a useful framework considering the limitations in the scale separation that can be achieved in numerical simulations . also , the physical properties of the flows that can give rise to one or the other are somewhat different .",
    "helical flows have proved efficient in generating large - scale dynamos , i.e. , on scales larger than the energy - containing eddies of the flow @xcite .",
    "it is now known that large - scale dynamo action can also be produced by anisotropic and inhomogeneous flows ( e.g. , flows with a large scale shear ) . on the other hand ,",
    "non - helical flows can be instrumental in generating small - scale dynamos @xcite , i.e. , on sizes smaller than those of the energy - containing eddies @xcite . in recent years , the study of small - scale dynamos with magnetic prandtl number @xmath0 ( the ratio between the viscosity and the magnetic diffusivity of the plasma ) different from unity has received special attention @xcite , both for @xmath1 @xcite and for @xmath2 @xcite . motivations to study these regimes include recent experiments of dynamo action using liquid sodium @xcite , as well as the fact that many astrophysical plasmas are characterized by magnetic prandtl numbers different from unity .",
    "for instance , the magnetic prandtl number is much smaller than one in the solar convective region , and it is typically much larger than one in the interplanetary medium and also in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .    for sufficiently low - density media such as the one that pervades the ism , kinetic effects such as the hall effect or ambipolar diffusion might also become relevant @xcite .",
    "the potential relevance of ambipolar diffusion in astrophysical dynamos was studied in refs .",
    "the relevance of the hall effect has been recognized in various astrophysical applications @xcite , space plasmas @xcite , and also laboratory plasmas @xcite .",
    "the role of the hall effect on large - scale dynamos subjected to helical forcing has also been addressed in the literature @xcite .",
    "less attention has received the impact of kinetic effects on the small - scale dynamo . a theoretical model of the kinematic small - scale dynamo with hall effect",
    "was presented in @xcite , but to the best of our knowledge no numerical studies of the non - linear and saturated regime were considered in the literature .    in this paper , we present results from three dimensional simulations of the hall - mhd equations subjected to random non - helical forcing . the main aim is to study the role of the hall effect in the small - scale dynamo efficiency for different values of the hall parameter . as a result of the study",
    ", we also discuss the impact of the hall effect on the dynamo saturation values , and on magnetic and total dissipation rates .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "a brief introduction to the theoretical framework known as hall - mhd is presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : hmhd ] .",
    "the role of the hall effect in the efficiency of the dynamo is shown in sect .",
    "[ sec : lin ] . in sect .",
    "[ sec : spec ] we characterize the stationary regime that is attained when the dynamo process saturates , showing the corresponding energy power spectra . the energy transfer rates participating in the nonlinear energy cascade are displayed in sect .",
    "[ sec : trans ] . in sect .",
    "[ sec : pm ] , we explore the regime of large magnetic prandtl number ( i.e. , when the viscous dissipation scale is larger than the resistive dissipation scale ) which , as mentioned , is particularly relevant in diffuse media such as the ism .",
    "finally , the conclusions are summarized in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclu ] .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we consider incompressible flows , although compressible effects may be relevant , e.g. , in the ism for the formation of structures @xcite .",
    "incompressible hall - mhd is described by the modified induction equation ( i.e. , with the addition of the hall current ) and the equation of motion ( the navier - stokes equation ) , @xmath3        + \\eta \\nabla^2 { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ b $ } } \\label{hallmhd } \\\\ \\frac{\\partial { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ u $ } } } { \\partial t } & = & - \\left ( { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ u $ } } \\cdot \\nabla \\right ) { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ u $ } } + \\left ( { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ b $ } } \\cdot \\nabla \\right ) { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ b $ } } -   \\nabla \\left ( p + \\frac{b^2}{2 } \\right ) + \\nonumber \\\\   \\mbox { } & & { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ f $ } } + \\nu \\nabla^2 { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ u $ } } ,   \\label{ns}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 denotes a solenoidal and non - helical external force , which is delta - correlated in time .",
    "the velocity @xmath5 and the magnetic field @xmath6 are expressed in units of a characteristic speed @xmath7 ; @xmath8 is the magnetic diffusivity , and @xmath9 is the kinematic viscosity .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 measures the relative strength of the hall effect and can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a characteristic length scale , @xmath13 is the alfven speed , and @xmath14 is the ion plasma frequency ( @xmath15 : electron charge , @xmath16 : particle , electron , and ion density respectively , and @xmath17 : ion mass ) .",
    "hereafter , we adopt @xmath18 as our typical velocity , thus rendering the hall parameter simply as @xmath19 , i.e. , a dimensionless version of the ion skin depth .",
    "these equations are complemented by the solenoidal conditions for both vector fields , i.e. , @xmath20    from a theoretical point of view , hall - mhd corresponds to a two - fluid description of a fully ionized plasma : a positively charged ion species of mass @xmath17 moving with the velocity field @xmath21 , and negatively charged massless electrons with the velocity @xmath22 therefore , from eqs .",
    "( [ hallmhd])-([ue ] ) we obtain that in the ideal limit ( i.e. @xmath23 ) , the magnetic field is frozen to the electron flow . as a result , advection , stretching , and folding of magnetic field lines",
    "( mechanisms relevant for dynamo action ) are performed by the electron flow rather than by the bulk flow , resulting in potential modifications to magnetic field generation when the hall effect is not negligible .",
    "we performed simulations of the hall - mhd equations with a spatial resolution of @xmath24 gridpoints , using a pseudospectral code @xcite .",
    "the linear size of our numerical box is @xmath25 ( with @xmath26 a unit length ) , and periodic boundary conditions in the three cartesian directions are assumed .",
    "we apply the @xmath27 dealiasing rule , and therefore the maximum wavenumber resolved by the code is @xmath28 .",
    "we first consider simulations with magnetic prandtl number equal to unity ( i.e. , @xmath29 ) .",
    "the coefficients of viscosity and resistivity in these simulations are set to @xmath30 , which ensure that the dissipation scales are well resolved , i.e. , at all times the dissipation wavenumbers @xmath31 and @xmath32 remain smaller than @xmath33 ( here , @xmath34 is the vorticity , and @xmath35 is the current density ) . to evolve the equations in time we use a fully explicit second order runge - kutta scheme .",
    "we note that for hall - mhd , and for velocity and magnetic fields of order unity , the courant - friedrichs - levy ( cfl ) condition becomes @xmath36 ( due to the dispersive nature of the whistler waves ) , which is more restrictive than the regular cfl condition @xmath37 . as a result ,",
    "the time step decreases quadratically with the spatial resolution , and also decreases linearly with the hall parameter @xmath38 .",
    "the hall - mhd dynamo simulations are therefore computationally more expensive than the equivalent mhd runs , resulting in the modest spatial resolution considered here .",
    "we first generate stationary hydrodynamic turbulence by integrating eq .",
    "( [ ns ] ) subjected to random non - helical forcing ( i.e. , such that @xmath39 ) centered at wavenumbers @xmath40 and delta - correlated in time .",
    "once the kinetic energy reaches a stationary regime as a result of the balance between the power delivered by the external force and viscous dissipation , the hydrodynamic simulation is stopped . in a second stage , a random and small magnetic field is introduced at small scales , and the simulation is restarted with the full hall - mhd equations ( [ hallmhd])-([ns ] ) .",
    "we performed simulations with different values of the hall parameter @xmath38 , including a purely mhd case corresponding to @xmath41 . whenever @xmath42 , a new spatial scale is introduced ( the hall scale ) , which in the spectral domain is characterized by @xmath43 . in this paper , we consider the cases in which @xmath44 falls in between the macroscopic scale @xmath45 ( set by the external driver ) and the dissipation scales @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which is the relevant scenario for astrophysical plasmas such as the interstellar medium . in such media , the hall scale is several orders of magnitude smaller than the largest scales , and the hall effect can be expected to be relevant only at the smallest dynamical scales .",
    "note , however , that these arguments ought to be regarded as motivations .",
    "although the ordering of typical length scales is the correct one , a realistic separation of scales is completely out of reach with present computing power .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ener ] we show the statistically stationary time series for kinetic energy ( thin lines ) for runs with different values of the hall parameter @xmath38 . the magnetic energy in these runs ( thick line )",
    "is observed to rise until it saturates at values which remain a moderate fraction of the corresponding kinetic energy .",
    "the viscous ( thin line ) and resistive ( thick ) dissipation rates vs.  time are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diss ] for three runs with different values of the hall parameter . in all these plots ,",
    "the magnetic dissipation rate is observed to grow until it becomes fully comparable to the corresponding viscous dissipation rate ( even when the kinetic energy is larger than the magnetic energy ) .    , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 ( from top to bottom).,title=\"fig : \" ]    , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 ( from top to bottom).,title=\"fig : \" ]    the exponentially fast growth of magnetic energy",

    "[ fig : b2 ] for the same three runs .",
    "note that there is an initial stage where the magnetic field starts growing exponentially fast , regardless of the particular value of the hall parameter @xmath38 . during this early stage of the dynamo ,",
    "the electron flow is still approximately equal to the ion flow , i.e. @xmath50 [ see eq . ( [ ue ] ) ] . keeping in mind that the growing magnetic field remains approximately frozen ( note that this is strictly valid only in the limit @xmath23 ) to the electron velocity field",
    ", we can anticipate that at some point in time the electron and ion flows will start drifting appart from one another . therefore , a second stage arises corresponding to a non - linear dynamo ( although still `` kinematic , '' in the sense that the magnetic field does not affect the bulk velocity field ) , since the magnetic field is being advected by the electron flow which at that point becomes a function of the magnetic field itself . in fig .",
    "[ fig : b2 ] we see that although the case @xmath41 can be approximated by a linear growth rate ( indicated by the dotted straight line ) all the way up to the saturation level , we can not do the same for the cases @xmath51 , and @xmath52 since there is a break in the corresponding growth rates .",
    "this break occurs first for the case with larger hall effect ( i.e. , @xmath53 ) , but the incremented slope is larger for the case @xmath51 .",

    "@xcite ) , and a @xmath71 power law is asymptotically expected for the magnetic energy spectrum at the low wavenumber end .",
    "even though kazantsev s model was devised for pure mhd ( no hall effect ) and for large magnetic prandtl numbers , our hall - mhd simulations also reproduce an @xmath69 magnetic spectrum equally well .",

    ".    in summary , a preliminary inspection of the magnetic energy power spectra at early times shows no noticeable differences between mhd and hall - mhd . on the one hand",
    "this is not surprising , since the hall effect is nonlinear in the magnetic field , and the magnetic energy at early times is much smaller than the kinetic energy at all scales . on the other hand , in what follows we show that this last conclusion is somewhat premature , since there are other aspects of these turbulent dynamos that clearly show the consequences of the hall effect .    at saturation ,",
