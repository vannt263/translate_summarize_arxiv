    "super - kamiokande ( sk ) is a water cherenkov detector containing 50,000 tons of pure water .",
    "it is located 1000 meters underground ( 2,700 meters of water equivalent ) in kamioka zinc mine in japan .",
    "the detector consists of a main inner detector and an outer veto detector .",
    "both detectors are contained within a cylindrical stainless steel tank 39.3 m in diameter @xmath0 41.4 m in height .",
    "the usual fiducial mass for neutrino measurements is 22.5 ktons with boundaries 2.0 m from the inner surface .    the first phase of the sk ( sk - i ) started in april , 1996 , and terminated in july , 2001 .",
    "a total of 11,146 pmts with 20-inch diameter photocathodes provided active light collection over 40@xmath1 of the surface of the inner detector .",
    "then , in spite of the loss of numerous pmts in an accident , the second phase ( sk - ii ) started in december , 2002 .",
    "a total of 5,182 20-inch pmts , each protected by acrylic and fiber - reinforced plastic ( frp ) cases , were mounted on the inner detector , providing 19@xmath1 photocathode coverage during this period .",
    "sk - ii ran until october 2005 . in the analysis of the sk - ii data ,",
    "analysis methods had to be revised due to the loss of detector sensitivity , however it turned out that the revised method also effective in the sk - i data analysis .    in july 2006",
    ", sk detector was totally recovered with 40@xmath1 photocathode coverage and started taking data as sk - iii . during this phase ,",
    "the water flow in the tank had been tuned up and the low energy background was reduced . in order to further enhance its performance , sk - iii",
    "was terminated in august 2008 , and the readout electronics and online data acquisition system were upgraded .",
    "the fourth phase ( sk - iv ) started in september 2008 . in this paper",
    "we report updated sk - i + sk - ii results of solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillation analyses and the detector status of sk - iii and sk - iv .",
    "the advantages of sk in the solar neutrino observation are the time variation measurement , the direction - sensitivity , and the very precise measurement of its spectrum due to the well calibrated energy of recoil electrons@xcite .",
    "the solar neutrino flux can be derived from the extracted number of signal events by fitting signal@xmath2background shapes to the recoil angle distribution relative to the sun ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the observed solar neutrino flux in each phase of sk is summarized in table   + reftab : flux .",
    "the sk - ii flux value is statistically consistent with the sk - i value .",
    "figure  [ fig : energy_spectrum ] shows the sk - ii observed energy spectrum divided by the expected spectrum without oscillation determined from the bp2004 ssm@xcite . the line through the spectrum represents the total sk - i average .",

    "the determination of the solar neutrino oscillation parameters in sk - i and sk - ii is accomplished in the same way@xcite . two neutrino oscillation is assumed and for each set of oscillation parameters , a @xmath4 minimization of the total @xmath5b and",
    "hep neutrino flux is fit to the data .",
    "this yields exclude regions , while by constraining the @xmath5b flux to the total nc flux value from sno@xcite , allowed regions can be obtained .",
    "figure  [ fig : contours ] shows both excluded and allowed regions at 95@xmath1 confidence level .    the combination of other solar neutrino experiments such as sno and radiochemical results ( homestake , gallex and sage ) with the sk combined analysis is also accomplished and shown figure  [ fig : contours ] .",

    "super - kamiokande has reported that the atmospheric neutrino data are well consistent with the pure @xmath9 two flavor oscillation scheme@xcite .",
    "recently @xmath9 oscillation analyses for zenith angle distributions and l / e distribution are re - performed using sk - i and sk - ii data with improved analysis methods to get more stringent constraint on the oscillation parameters .",
    "the changes to the simulation include : an update of the atmospheric neutrino flux model to the `` honda06 '' model@xcite ; various modifications to the neutrino interaction model , neut@xcite ( _ e.g. _ , change of quasi - elastic and single pion axial mass to @xmath10 = 1.2 gev , addition of lepton mass effects for charged - current single pion production , and addition of the pion - less delta decay channel @xmath11 ) ; improvements to the detector simulation model of light reflections and scattering ; better tuning of outer detector parameters in the simulation ; and improvements in the ring counting algorithm .",
    "additionally , at the time of re - analysis , the systematic uncertainties were re - evaluated and a few new uncertainties were added .",
    "atmospheric neutrino data are categorized into fully - contained ( fc ) , partially - contained ( pc ) , and upward - going muon ( up@xmath12 ) events . in the zenith angle analysis ,",
    "1489 days of sk - i fc / pc data 1646 days of up@xmath12 sk - i data , 799 days of sk - ii fc / pc data and 828 days of up@xmath12 sk - ii data are used .",
    "all samples are divided in 10 zenith angle bins .",
    "the definition of the event bins are same as sk - i and sk - ii , and 400 bins for sk - i and 350 bins for sk - ii are used in the analysis . the number of observed events in each of 750 bins is compared with the monte carlo expectation .",
    "a @xmath4 value is defined according to the poisson probability distribution . in the fitting",
    ", the expected number of events in each bin is recalculated to account for 90 systematic errors , which come from the uncertainty of the neutrino flux model , neutrino cross - section model , event selection , and the detector response .",
    "figure  [ fig : atm_contours ] shows contours of allowed parameter regions .",
    "best fit parameter set is @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    in the l / e analysis ,",
    "more strict selection criteria are applied to the subsample data , because a good resolution for neutrino flight pathlength , l , and energy , e , is required when trying to observe the expected dip in the l / e spectrum due to oscillations .",
    "1468 days of sk - i fc / pc @xmath12-like events and 799 days of sk - ii fc / pc @xmath12-like events are used and divided in 43 bins of @xmath15(l / e ( ) ) .",
    "the results of a minimum @xmath4 fit to the 43 bins with 29 systematic error terms are shown in figure  [ fig : atm_contours ] .",
    "best fit parameter set is @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the lower energy threshold of sk - i had been limited to around 5.0 mev due to residual radon in the water emanated from the pmt / frp , therefore the water purification system was upgraded and the water flow in sk tank had been tuned in the sk - iii phase .",
    "figure  [ fig : bg ] shows @xmath3 distribution of the central region . in the 5.0 - 5.5mev region ,",
    "background event rate of sk - iii is about 1/3 of that of sk - i , while the signal rate looks similar .",
    "based on this background reduction , the trigger threshold had been lowered since april 2008 , and 100@xmath1 trigger effifiency at 4.5mev was achieved in the last period of sk - iii .",
    "z@xmath18 - 7.5 m , r@xmath1911 m ) .",
    "the blue line shows sk - i and the red line shows sk - iii . ]    in order to further enhance its performance , new electronics system using custom asic had been developed and was installed to sk . in the new system ,",
    "all pmt hits are sent to the front - end daq computers by a periodic timimg signal and software triggers are spplied to select interesting event windows .",
    "sk has started taking data of every hit without any hardware trigger as `` sk - iv '' since september 2008 .",
    "this enables higher speed data taking , much lower energy threshold and wider dynamic range with aiming at increasing detection efficiency of super nova burst neutrino , detecting the spectrum distortion of low energy @xmath5b solar neutrino , and improving the energy resolution of multi - gev atmospheric neutrino .",
    "super - kamiokande ( sk - i , ii , iii ) have been operated successfully , and more than 10 years of dataset for solar and atmospheric neutrino are accumulated . with the combined sk - i and sk - ii dataset , the best fit oscillation parameter set is found at tan@xmath6 and @xmath7ev@xmath8 in the solar global analysis and at @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the atmospheric zenith angle analysis . in sk - iii ,",
    "the the background rate in the low energy region was reduced and sk - iv has just started since september 2008 with upgraded electronics .",
    "super - kamiokande will continue to observe every predicted effect and measure mixing angles .",
    "in addition , high - statistics data sets make it feasible to search for sub - dominat , exotic , and non - oscillation physics ."
