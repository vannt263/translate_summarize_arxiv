    "in the last years the interest in physics for discrete space - time theories has increased mainly in relation with quantum gravity @xcite . in a scenario where the physical space - time may be discrete ( i.e. there is a fundamental length in the space - time let @xmath3 be the fundamental space length and @xmath4 the fundamental time length that could be related with planck s constant ) , continuous theories",
    "would only be approximations to the reality .",
    "hence , it seems interesting the study of discrete physical theories such that in the limit of @xmath3 going to zero we recover the well known and established continuous physical theories .",
    "one way to do that is to discretize continuous physical theories , in particular quantum theories .",
    "it is obvious , that after discretization some properties will be conserved and other ones will disappear . a detailed study about when , how and why this happens would be pertinent and very interesting .",
    "this is the aim of this work : to study how to discretize a physical theory in such a way that properties related with symmetries in the continuous case can be preserved in the process , and so , to analyse the behaviour of quantum mechanics after discretization .",
    "the umbral calculus is the mathematical tool that we will use to discretize quantum mechanics .",
    "it has been used recently to provide discrete representations of canonical commutation relations ( i.e. @xmath5=1 $ ] ) in order to discretize linear differential equations , in such a way that the continuous point symmetries are preserved the most cases .    in this paper",
    "we will consider a fixed lattice and use the umbral correspondence to obtain discrete solutions maintaining certain commutation relations @xcite .",
    "the history of the umbral calculus goes back to the 17th century : taylor , newton , barrow , vandermonde , etc .",
    "@xcite found some theorems and expressions relating powers with polynomials .",
    "however , in the second half of the 19th century through sylvester , cayley and blissard appeared the terms ` umbrae ' ( shadow in latin ) and ` umbral calculus ' for the first time in relation with a set of ` magic ' rules of lowering and raising indices . some mathematical developments , like the theory of sheffer polynomials ( called appell polynomials or more generally polynomials of type zero ) and the theory of abstract linear operators by pincherle @xcite , converged to umbral calculus .",
    "finally , in the second half of the 20th century rota , roman and collaborators developed the umbral calculus as a linear algebra of operators .",
    "thus , they formulated the theory of the umbral algebra and its dual in the space of formal series .",
    "a large bibliography about umbral calculus and its applications can be found in ref .",

    "we introduce the basic concepts of umbral calculus in terms of the theory of linear operators . in section  [ umbralcorrespondence ]",
    "we show the main facts relative to the discretization of the ( continuous ) quantum mechanics .",

    "<S> the idea is to discretize the continuous schrdinger equation substituting the continuous derivatives by discrete ones and the space - time continuous variables by well determined operators that verify some umbral calculus conditions . in this way </S>",
    "<S> we assure that some properties of integrability and symmetries of the continuous equation are preserved and also the solutions of the continuous case can be recovered discretized in a simple way . </S>",
    "<S> the case of the schrdinger equation with a potential depending only in the space variable is discussed .    </S>",
