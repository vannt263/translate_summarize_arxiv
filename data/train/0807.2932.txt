    "let @xmath0 be a finitely generated group and let @xmath1 be a subgroup of @xmath0 .",
    "we say that @xmath1 is a co - dimension 1 subgroup if @xmath2 has more than 1 end , where @xmath3 is the cayley graph of @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath0 splits over @xmath1 then one easily sees that @xmath1 is co - dimension 1 .",
    "the opposite is not true , for example any closed geodesic on a surface group gives a cyclic codimension 1 subgroup of the fundamental group of the surface . on the other hand",
    "only simple closed geodesics correspond to splittings .",
    "the surface example can be generalized to @xmath4 complexes to produce examples of codimension 1 subgroups : if @xmath5 is a finite @xmath4 complex of ( say ) dimension 2 and if @xmath6 is a locally geodesic track on @xmath5 then the subgroup of @xmath7 corresponding to @xmath6 is a codimension 1 free subgroup of @xmath0 .",
    "wise ( @xcite ) has exploited this idea producing codimension 1 subgroups for small cancellation groups . in the setting of small cancellation groups",
    "of course one needs some combinatorial analog for the convexity property of geodesics ( or tracks ) and wise develops such a notion .",
    "pride ( @xcite ) has shown that there are small cancellation groups that have property fa , so such groups have codimension 1 subgroups but do not split .",
    "stallings showed that if a compact set separates the cayley graph of a finitely generated group @xmath0 , into at least two unbounded components , then @xmath0 splits over a finite group .",
    "bowditch ( @xcite ) showed something similar for hyperbolic groups : if the boundary @xmath8 of a 1-ended hyperbolic group @xmath0 has a local cut point , then the group splits over a 2-ended group , unless it is a triangle group .",
    "there have been other generalizations of stallings theorem similar in spirit .",
    "the general idea is that if a ` small ' set ( coarsely ) separates the cayley graph of a group then the group splits over a subgroup quasi - isometric to the ` small set ' . for a precise conjecture",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to show the limitations of this ` philosophy ' . given any @xmath9 , we produce an example of a hyperbolic group @xmath0 , such that @xmath10 , @xmath8 is separated by a set of dimension 0 ( a cantor set ) and @xmath0 has property @xmath11 ( so it does not split over any subgroup ) .",
    "our example is based on wise s construction which we generalize to the setting of small cancellation theory over free products .",
    "a diagram is a finite connected planar graph .",
    "the faces of a diagram @xmath12 are the closures of the bounded components of @xmath13 .    in what follows",
    "we assume always that each interior vertex ( i.e. not on @xmath14 ) of a diagram has degree at least 3 .",
    "we can always achieve this by erasing all interior vertices of degree 2 .",
    "we will need some small cancellation results about diagrams shown by mccammond and wise in @xcite .",
    "for the reader s convenience and also because our setting is slightly different we include these results here .",
    "these results strengthen classical small cancellation results ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we need some notation : if @xmath12 is a diagram we denote by @xmath14 the boundary of the unbounded component of @xmath13 ( so if @xmath15 is the unbounded component of @xmath13 , @xmath16 ) .",
    "we say that the diagram is _ non singular _ if @xmath14 is homeomorphic to @xmath17 .",
    "we say that an edge of @xmath12 is interior edge if it does not lie on @xmath14 .    if @xmath12 is a diagram we denote by @xmath18 respectively the total number of edges , faces and vertices of the diagram .",
    "we denote by @xmath19 respectively the number of edges of the diagram that lie ( do not lie ) on @xmath14 .",
    "we denote by @xmath20 the number of vertices on @xmath14 that lie in exactly one face and by @xmath21 the number of vertices on @xmath14 that lie on more than one face .",
    "we denote by @xmath22 the number of vertices of @xmath12 that do not lie on @xmath14 .",
    "we say that a diagram verifies the @xmath23 condition if every face of the diagram has at least 6 sides .",
    "we have the following version of greedlinger s lemma ( see @xcite ) :    [ greed ] let @xmath12 be a non singular diagram which verifies the condition @xmath23",
    ". then @xmath24 .",
    "we have the following inequalities :    @xmath25 this is because each face has at least 6 edges and each interior edge lies in at most 2 faces while boundary edges lie in one face .",
    "@xmath26    this is because each edge has at most 2 vertices and each interior edge has degree at least 3 .    using euler s formula and the first inequality we obtain :    @xmath27    we remark now that @xmath28 substituting @xmath29 above and using the second inequality for @xmath30 we obtain    @xmath31 @xmath32    we recall some definitions from @xcite :    let @xmath12 be a non singular diagram . a face @xmath33 of the diagram",
    "is called an @xmath34-spur if the intersection of @xmath33 with the boundary of @xmath12 is connected and exactly @xmath34-edges of @xmath33 are interior edges of @xmath12 .",
    "we say that a diagram @xmath12 is a ladder if there are at most two faces @xmath35 of @xmath12 such that @xmath36 are connected while for every other face @xmath33 of @xmath12 , @xmath37 has exactly 2 components .",
    "we have the following corollary from lemma [ greed ] :    [ ladder ] let @xmath12 be a non singular disc diagram which is @xmath23 and contains no @xmath38-spurs and at most two @xmath34-spurs for @xmath39 . then either @xmath12 has a single region or it contains exactly two @xmath34-spurs with @xmath39 and it is a ladder .",
    "we modify @xmath12 as follows : if a face @xmath33 of @xmath12 has more than 6 edges and it intersects the boundary we erase successively vertices of @xmath33 that do not lie on any other face till @xmath33 has 6 edges ( or there are no more vertices to erase ) .",
    "let s call @xmath40 the new diagram .",
    "@xmath40 is still a @xmath23 diagram .",
    "@xmath40 contains also no @xmath38-spurs and at most two @xmath34-spurs for @xmath39 .",
    "we consider now a face @xmath33 of @xmath40 that intersects the boundary and we see how it contributes to @xmath41 . if @xmath33 is not an @xmath34-spur then 2 vertices of @xmath33 contribute to @xmath20 while at least 4 vertices of @xmath33 contribute to @xmath21 .",
    "so the total contribution of all such faces to the difference @xmath42 is at most 0 ( note that the contribution is not necessarily negative as we count twice the @xmath21 vertices as they lie in at least 2 faces ) .",
    "the contribution of an @xmath34-spur to the difference @xmath42 is @xmath43 .",
    "since @xmath12 contains no 3-spurs and at most 2 @xmath34-spurs for @xmath39 , the inequality @xmath44 implies that if @xmath40 has more than one face then @xmath40 has exactly two 1-spurs , say @xmath35 .",
    "if we erase @xmath45 we obtain a diagram @xmath46 which is again @xmath23 .",
    "we note that @xmath45 intersects exactly one face of @xmath40 so after erasing it the diagram @xmath46 has still the other 1-spur of @xmath40 and at most one new @xmath34-spur for some @xmath47 . by the inequality @xmath24",
    "again we conclude as before that either @xmath46 has only one face or it has exactly two 1-spurs @xmath48 .",
    "inductively we see that @xmath40 is a ladder hence @xmath12 is also a ladder .    we will need a more technical result . if @xmath49 is a vertex in a diagram we denote by @xmath50 the valency of @xmath49 .",
    "the result below will be used to show that small cancellation products of word hyperbolic groups are word hyperbolic .    [ isop ] let @xmath12 be a non singular diagram that verifies the condition @xmath51 .",
    "then @xmath52    in particular @xmath53 i.e. @xmath12 satisfies a linear isoperimetric inequality .",
    "we denote by @xmath54 the set of vertices of @xmath12 ( the 0-skeleton ) .",
    "clearly @xmath55    we have also the following inequality :    @xmath56 this is because each face has at least 7 edges and each interior edge lies in at most 2 faces while boundary edges lie in one face .    using euler s formula and the inequality above",
    "we obtain :    @xmath57 since @xmath58 for every @xmath49 in the interior of @xmath12 :    @xmath59 by ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) we have    @xmath60    since @xmath61 we have    @xmath62 and using ( 3 )    @xmath63",
    "small cancellation theory can be developed over free products ( see @xcite ) .",

    "we have then the following small cancellation conditions :    * _ condition _ @xmath72 : if @xmath73 and @xmath74 with @xmath75 reduced word and @xmath71 a piece then @xmath76 . *",
    "_ condition _ @xmath77 : no element of @xmath6 is a product of fewer than @xmath78 pieces . * _ condition _ @xmath79 : if @xmath80 and @xmath81 is a product of @xmath78 pieces then @xmath82 .",
    "wise showed in @xcite that groups that admit a presentation in which all relators have even length and condition @xmath83 is satisfied , have codimension 1 subgroups .",
    "clearly condition @xmath84 is stronger than condition @xmath83 so wise s result holds for these groups too .",

    "note however that @xmath97 might lie in the same factor .",
    "we say that a word @xmath98 is _ weakly cyclically reduced _ if it is reduced and @xmath99 .",
    "we say that a sequence of words @xmath6 is symmetrized if whenever @xmath73 all weakly cyclically reduced conjugates of @xmath67 and @xmath68 are in @xmath6 .",

    "let now @xmath33 be a free product @xmath104 and let @xmath6 be a symmetrized subset of @xmath33 .",
    "the group @xmath0 defined by the free product presentation @xmath105 is the quotient @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the normal closure of @xmath6 in @xmath33 .",
    "we show now that if a group @xmath0 has a free product presentation @xmath105 that satisfies the @xmath108 condition then @xmath0 has a codimension 1 subgroup .",
    "we start first by considering van - kampen diagrams over @xmath0 .",
    "we consider a usual presentation of @xmath0 with a set of generators @xmath109 given by the generators of @xmath110 and a set of relators consisting of relators of the @xmath111s together with a set @xmath112 such that @xmath6 is obtained by taking all weak cyclic conjugates of elements in @xmath112 and their inverses .",

    "we remark now that since @xmath134 has an even number of sides each vertex has a vertex opposite to it , so we associate to this vertex the diagonal joining it with the opposite vertex .",
