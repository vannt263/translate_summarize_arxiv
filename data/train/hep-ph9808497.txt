    "the possibility that the electroweak symmetry is broken by a strongly interacting scalar sector received considerable attention in the literature .",
    "interesting scenarios were proposed , such as the possibility of a higgs boson coupled strongly to the vector bosons and to itself @xcite , and the formation of a spectrum of bound states at a higher scale which would restore unitarity in scattering processes @xcite . also phenomenological models were proposed for studying quantitatively the implications of strong interactions in the electroweak symmetry breaking sector , such as the bess model @xcite .    however , beyond the phenomenological models of strong interactions , an approach based on first principles was missing because of leak of a nonperturbative solution , and of technical difficulties in extending perturbation theory in higher - loop orders .",
    "realistic calculations on a lattice of physical processes involving the higgs sector are still confronted with technical limitations set , among other issues , by the size of the lattice .",
    "@xmath0 expansions in the higgs sector were only performed at leading order , which is a rather poor approximation .",
    "perturbation theory in the higgs sector beyond one - loop becomes very difficult because it involves feynman diagrams with massive internal lines and finite external momenta , for which already at two - loop there are no general analytical solutions available .",
    "recently , considerable progress has been made in understanding from first principles the nature of the standard higgs sector when its coupling becomes strong .",
    "this is due mainly to technical advances in massive higher - loop techniques and in higher - order nonperturbative @xmath0 expansions . in this paper",
    "we would like to discuss the perturbative and nonperturbative aspects of this behaviour at strong coupling .",
    "the major question which will be addressed by future experiments at the lhc is how is the electroweak symmetry broken in nature .",
    "while it may or may not turn out to be actually broken by strong , nonperturbative interactions , the higgs sector remains a fairly simple but not trivial model , where new perturbative and nonperturbative solutions can be tested , in view of applying them to other , possibly more complicated theories .",
    "the existing calculations of leading @xmath7 radiative corrections in the standard higgs sector at two - loop level are based on using the equivalence theorem in landau gauge .",
    "this way radiative corrections involve only diagrams with scalars on the internal lines , so that the problem at hand becomes much simpler .",
    "this procedure was proposed for the first time in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the one - loop correction to higgs decay into vector bosons was calculated in this way .",
    "so far at two - loop level the scalar self - energies and the main decay modes of a heavy higgs boson ( @xmath8 , ww , zz ) are known , and also the high energy limit of vector boson scattering @xcite .",
    "the vector boson scattering is known completely only at one - loop level @xcite .",

    "we plot the correction factors given by eqns . 2 in figure 1 .",
    "one can see that for both correction factors the two - loop correction becomes as large as the one - loop correction for @xmath7 about 1 tev ( 1.1 tev for @xmath13 , and 930 gev for @xmath14 ) .",
    "even if the higher - loop corrections are not yet known , this pattern suggests that the radiative corrections blow up strongly around @xmath15 1 tev . note that the scheme ambiguities associated with the two - loop result become substantial already for considerable smaller values of the higgs mass @xcite",
    "of course , similar conclusions can be obtained from other scattering processes apart from the decay modes .",
    "this behaviour is in agreement with well - established results regarding perturbative unitarity violation in vector boson scattering at tree level @xcite .",
    "the point where the perturbative expansion blows up depends on the expansion parameter , and therefore on the renormalization scheme .",
    "so far the two - loop results mentioned above were translated into the @xmath16 @xcite and the pole @xcite renormalization schemes for processes at the higgs mass energy scale , in the hope that perturbation theory may show better convergence properties in certain schemes .",
    "an overall conclusion of these studies is that the @xmath16 scheme diverges somewhat sooner and has larger scheme uncertainty than the on - shell scheme , while the pole scheme appears to have slightly better convergence properties than the on - shell scheme . for a more refined discussion of the scheme and gauge dependence",
    "@xcite    while the existing higher - order perturbative results in the scalar sector are consistent with a strong blow - up of radiative corrections at about @xmath15 1 tev , this fact appears somehow puzzling if one considers that the quartic coupling of the scalar sector , @xmath11 , is only of order .4 for @xmath15 1 tev .",
    "from the perspective of the nonperturbative solution to be discussed in the following section , the reason for this behaviour is the higgs mass saturation effect . due to the dynamics of the scalar sector ,",
    "the on - shell higgs mass is not a good parameterization of the quartic coupling for values larger than @xmath15 1 tev .",
    "however , as will be shown in the following section , at the fundamental level , the scalar sector is perfectly well defined at higher values of the quartic coupling . well - behaved , unitary solutions can be obtained for various processes by using nonperturbative methods .    at a more speculative level , the fact that the pole scheme seems to show somewhat better convergence properties than the on - shell scheme may have its origin in another nonperturbative property of the higgs self - energy .",
    "this type of nonperturbative effect was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of a theory of vector bosons coupled to a large number of light fermions .",
    "the idea is that due to the structure of the self - energy function the on - shell renormalization condition may have no solution for a range of the theory s coupling , while the pole renormalization condition may have a solution .",
    "this results in the on - shell mass being suitable for parameterizing the theory only for a more limited range of the physical coupling than the pole mass .",
    "should such a nonperturbative effect be present in the higgs sector , this could explain the pattern observed in perturbation theory . in ref .",
    "@xcite this was investigated by using the nonperturbative @xmath0 expansion , and it was shown that this effect is not present in the higgs sector of the standard model at lo .",
    "it is still an open question if it appears at nlo .",
    "the @xmath0 expansion aims at a nonperturbative solution in order to avoid the problems of perturbation theory at large coupling .",
    "perturbation theory ceases to be a satisfactory solution when radiative correction blow up already at lower loop orders and the renormalization scheme ambiguity is so large that the result becomes unreliable .",
    "the @xmath0 approach is free of these problems because all radiative corrections of all loop orders are explicitly summed up .",
    "the idea is to treat the higgs sector as an @xmath17-symmetric sigma model , where @xmath18 for the standard model , and to expand in @xmath0 instead of the quartic coupling .",
    "the solution is then valid independently of the strength of the coupling  the quality of the approximation depends on the value of @xmath19 .",
    "also it is completely free of renormalization scheme ambiguities .",
    "one can work in any intermediate renormalization scheme and still obtain the same result .",
    "another interesting nonperturbative feature of the @xmath0 expansion of the sigma model is the finiteness of wave function renormalization constants .",
    "this is a property of the exact nonperturbative solution , and was checked at next - to - leading order in @xmath0 .",
    "however , the renormalization of the coupling constants is ultraviolet divergent .    as an extra bonus ,",
    "the @xmath0 solution provides naturally a consistent treatment of resonant scattering amplitudes .",
    "this was known as a long - standing issue in perturbation theory .",
    "the essence of the problem is that around a resonance one has to perform a dyson summation which in perturbation theory at any finite order introduces incomplete higher order contributions which are unphysical . in gauge theories",
    "this leads to gauge dependent results .",
    "meanwhile a solution to this problem was found @xcite , which is based on a laurent expansion around the physical pole . within perturbation theory ,",
    "this solves the problem in a fundamental way , and applies consistently to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "another approach which was proposed is to use gauge invariant pinch technique self - energies in the dyson summation . for phenomenological purposes",
    "only , other approaches to treat resonant amplitudes were proposed in the literature , which amount to special resummations of low oder results . some of them may be easier to use in certain phenomenological applications . at the same time they are less fundamental theoretically",
    " some of them still contain unphysical higher order terms , or apply only to tree level or one - loop calculations .",
    "the @xmath0 solution is automatically free of these problems of perturbation theory because it is an all - order solution in the loop expansion .",
    "however , the @xmath0 solution still has some residual ambiguity which can be related to the triviality problem and to possible nondecoupling effects from a hidden heavy sector .",
    "technically , this appears in the tachyonic regularization .",
    "perturbation theory is used at an intermediary stage in the usual @xmath0 treatment , but perturbation theory does not determine the solution uniquely .",
    "this is the physical origin of the ambiguity entailed in the tachyonic regularization .",
    "we start with the usual lagrangean of a @xmath17-symmetric sigma model :    @xmath20    from this lagrangean one can in principle derive directly a perturbative expansion for green functions , and classify the feynman diagrams according to their order in @xmath0 .",
    "however , beyond leading order the combinatorics becomes very complicated . in order to perform explicit calculations beyond leading order",
    "it is useful to perform a rearrangement of perturbation theory .",
    "a useful trick for doing this was proposed in ref .",
    "it consists of adding a nondynamical term to the lagrangean :    @xmath21    this involves the introduction of an unphysical auxiliary field @xmath22 .",
    "as one can see , the equation of motion for @xmath22 is just an equation of constraint , and therefore the physical spectrum and the dynamics of the model remain unchanged .",
    "the effect of this trick is that the feynman rules are changed .",
    "namely , the quartic couplings are eliminated .",
    "the only vertices left are trilinear , and involve one @xmath22 field and two physical scalars .",
    "this simplifies enormously the combinatorics of feynman graphs in higher orders .",
    "we note that some other rearrangement schemes with different properties were discussed for the @xmath17-symmetric sigma model in ref .",
    "@xcite . to our best knowledge",
    ", these schemes were not applied so far in actual calculations .    in the following",
    "we describe the counterterm structure which is used for performing renormalization at nlo in the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "a somewhat different approach is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , but the final results are the same .    renormalization is performed in principle order by order in perturbation theory . however , for performing actual calculations of higher order in @xmath0 , it is of advantage to group all counterterms of various loop orders and which are of the same @xmath0 order into the same @xmath0 counterterm .",
    "we define the @xmath0 counterterms as follows :      here we already used the fact that the tadpole and wave function renormalization counterterms do not receive contributions at leading order in @xmath0 .",
    "we also note that although two tadpole counterterms are present , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , they are related through the gap equation @xcite , for instance by requesting that the leading order ground state condition @xmath26 be preserved in higher orders , where @xmath27 is the vacuum expectation value of the @xmath22 field in the spontaneously broken phase .    at this point",
    "it is useful to note that since the two lagrangeans of eqns .",
    "3 and 4 are equivalent , a linear combination will also describe the same physics .",
    "this observation can be exploited for performing bphz renormalization in a more elegant way , as will be explained in the following . beyond leading order in @xmath0",
    "it is advantageous to work with a linear combination of the potential parts of lagrangeans @xmath28 and @xmath29 . keeping only the contributions relevant for next - to - leading order calculations , we consider in fact the following lagrangean :    @xmath30                 + \\frac { 1}{2 } ( \\partial_{\\mu } \\sigma)(\\partial^{\\mu } \\sigma )                    \\left [ 1 + \\frac{2}{n}\\delta z_{\\sigma } \\right ]      \\nonumber \\\\                 &   &                         + \\chi^2 \\frac{n}{2 } \\left\\ { \\frac{3}{\\lambda }              + \\delta \\lambda^{(0 ) }               + \\frac{1}{n } \\left [ \\delta \\lambda               + 2 \\left ( \\frac{3}{\\lambda } + \\delta \\lambda^{(0 ) } \\right )                  \\delta z_{\\chi } \\right ]   \\right\\ }      \\nonumber \\\\                 &   &                         -   \\chi \\sigma \\sqrt{n } v \\left [ 1 + \\frac{1}{n }                     \\left ( \\delta z_{\\chi } + \\delta z_{\\sigma } \\right ) \\right ]      \\nonumber \\\\                 &   &                         - \\frac{1}{2 } \\left ( \\vec\\pi^2 + \\sigma^2 \\right )                     \\frac{v^2}{n } \\delta t_{\\chi }      \\nonumber \\\\                 &   &                         - \\frac{1}{2 } \\chi \\vec\\pi^2 \\left [ 1          + \\frac{1}{n } \\left ( \\delta z_{\\chi } + 2 \\delta z_{\\pi } \\right )   \\right ]      \\nonumber \\\\                 &   &                         - \\frac{1}{2 } \\chi \\sigma^2 \\left [ 1          + \\frac{1}{n } \\left ( \\delta z_{\\chi }                           + 2 \\delta z_{\\sigma } \\right )   \\right ]      \\nonumber \\\\                 &   &                         - \\sigma \\frac{v^3}{\\sqrt{n } } \\delta t_{\\chi }       + \\chi",

    "the maximum of the resonance does not shift towards higher energy , the resonance only becomes wider . to make this effect clearer , we extract some mass ( @xmath67 ) and width ( @xmath68 ) variables from the position and the height of the resonance in fermion scattering .",
    "the definition of the variables @xmath67 and @xmath68 is the following .",
    "we determined numerically the position and the height of the maximum of the resonance .",
    "then , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the mass and width of a breit - wigner resonance which has the same height and position of the peak . of course",
    ", the actual higgs lineshapes are not exactly of breit - wigner type .",
    "however , @xmath67 and @xmath68 describe reasonably well the main features of the resonance .",
    "we compare in figure 9 the @xmath67 ",
    "@xmath68 relation with the perturbative result .",
    "of course one is free to choose any other parameterization of the resonance , but the @xmath67 and @xmath68 variables which we use here are sufficient for comparing with perturbation theory .",
    "= 15 cm    as one can see in figure 8 , the saturation effect is present in the @xmath37 scattering process as well , at a comparable energy .",
    "the precise maximum position of the peak is process dependent because the resonance shape is deformed by the energy dependence of different contributions , such as the vertex corrections in this case",
    ". a universal way of parameterizing the saturation effect would be by using the pole mass and width of the higgs particle .",
    "extracting this in the next - to - leading @xmath0 approach is numerically more difficult because the subtracted @xmath0 graphs need to be continued into the second riemann sheet for solving the pole equation .",
    "this is not available yet .",
    "the saturation effect provides more insight in the way perturbation theory breaks down and radiative corrections blow up in the higgs sector .",
    "the dramatical failure of perturbation theory at around 1 tev is well - established by tree level unitarity violations @xcite .",
    "higher order radiative corrections blow up at a similar scale , as was discussed in section 2 .",
    "less violent problems can show up in the form of considerable scheme ambiguities of the results . at the same time however , it is puzzling that at the 1 tev scale the quartic coupling is numerically not exceedingly large yet .",
    "the quartic coupling only becomes of the order of unity when the tree level on - shell higgs mass is of the order of 1.5 tev .",
    "naively this is where one would expect heavy problems for perturbation theory to set in .",
    "from the perspective of the saturation effect , the explanation is clear now .",
    "the mass of the higgs boson is not a good expansion parameter beyond the saturation point . in the saturation region",
    "the mass does not increase when the coupling is enhanced .",
    "in fact , the width of the resonance as a function of the mass is a double valued function .",
    "the well - known perturbation theory results break down at about 1 tev because of the use of a bad expansion parameter . for that region",
    "the width would be a more appropriate parameterization of the coupling than the mass .",
    "in this section we would like to comment briefly on the perspectives of extending this kind of nonperturbative methods to solving other field theories of physical interest .",
    "we already mentioned that the applicability of the nonperturbative @xmath0 expansion , especially in higher orders , depends crucially on the particular theory under consideration .",
    "one needs to arrange the perturbative expansion of the theory in such a way that the various loop contributions can be sorted out by powers of @xmath0 in a manageable way , so that the graphs of all loop - orders can be explicitly calculated and summed up for a given order of @xmath0 .",
    "such a theory where the rearrangement of perturbation theory is straightforward is the ordinary qed .",
    "qed can be seen as an example where the @xmath0 expansion works poorly because the value of @xmath19 is too small .",
    "the existing calculations in perturbative qed are rather advanced , the coupling constant is small , and therefore the @xmath0 treatment of qed can hardly compete with the perturbative treatment . here",
    "we will briefly discuss a simple leading order @xmath0 qed calculation for comparing with perturbation theory , and see in which cases a @xmath0 treatment can be superior to perturbation theory .",
    "qed can be organized as a @xmath0 expansion by introducing @xmath19 species of electrons and at the same time dividing the gauge coupling by @xmath69 .",
    "then one sees immediately that the counting of powers of @xmath0 proceeds similarly as in the case of the sigma model .",
    "ordinary qed is recovered in the limit @xmath70 . already at this point",
    "one can expect the convergence of the @xmath0 expansion to be poor because of the value of the expansion parameter .",
    "= 7 cm    we show in figure 10 the feynman diagrams which contribute to the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron in leading order of @xmath0 .",
    "they are the same diagrams discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of the large order behaviour of qed .",
    "we refer to this work for details on the calculation of the contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment due to these diagrams .",
    "the equivalent of the tachyonic regularization in the @xmath17-symmetric sigma model is the subtraction in the loop momentum integration of the diagrams of figure 10 of a term of the type @xmath71 , which vanishes in perturbation theory , as discussed in ref .",
    "note that due to the value of the coupling constant , in qed the landau pole is at a very high energy scale .",
    "the perturbative results for the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron up to four - loop are @xcite :    @xmath72    and their contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment is @xmath73 .    by numerical integration one can calculate the lo contribution in the @xmath0 expansion to the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron .",
    "the result is @xmath74 .",
    "the first few terms in the loop expansion of this result are :    @xmath75    such that their contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment is @xmath76 .",
    "the numbers above agree with the results given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    by comparing the lo @xmath0 result with perturbation theory",
    ", one sees that this is only marginally different from the one - loop perturbative result . comparing the perturbative expansion of the lo @xmath0 result ( eqns .",
    "18 ) and the perturbation theory result ( eqns .",
    "17 ) , it can be seen that the lo @xmath0 feynman diagrams are not numerically the main contribution from higher - loop orders in perturbation theory .",
    "this shows that the usefulness of the @xmath0 expansion versus perturbation theory depends crucially on the value of @xmath19 and of the coupling constant .",
    "if @xmath19 is large enough , the other diagrams appearing in higher - order perturbation theory besides those included in the @xmath0 expansion will be suppressed by powers of @xmath0 . this way the @xmath0 expansion can converge faster than perturbation theory .",
    "if the coupling constant is large , perturbation theory starts to diverge already at low orders and the scheme ambiguities may prevent one to obtain the desired accuracy .",
    "then the @xmath0 expansion is expected to be a better alternative because it is free of scheme ambiguities and the solution is valid for strong coupling as well .",
    "therefore it is not surprising that the @xmath0 expansion works so well in heavy higgs physics , where @xmath77 and @xmath57 is of order 1 .",
    "extending these computational tools in the case of nonabelian gauge theories is very difficult because of the presence of trilinear and quartic couplings of the gauge bosons . in the case of qcd",
    "the topological structure of the graphs which appear in the @xmath78 expansion is known @xcite , but so far they could not be calculated explicitly in four dimensions .",
    "the well - known solution of qcd in two dimensions @xcite was possible because in this case the quartic and trilinear couplings are absent , which reduces the types of topologies of feynman graphs appearing in higher loop orders .",
    "we investigated in some detail the scalar sector of the standard model at strong coupling . for doing this",
    "we used both perturbation theory up to two - loop order and a nonperturbative treatment within the next - to - leading order @xmath0 expansion . with these approaches we treated the main heavy higgs decay modes as well as two scattering processes where",
    "the higgs line shape can be observed , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "these two scattering processes are the main @xmath79 channel production modes of the higgs boson at muon colliders , and can also be related to the heavy higgs effects in the gluon fusion process , which is the dominant production mechanism at the lhc .",
    "the results show in all cases a very good agreement between perturbation theory and the @xmath0 expansion up to 800900 gev .",
    "they confirm the existence of a higgs mass saturation effect in both scattering processes analyzed , which seems to be a general feature of resonant higgs processes .",
    "the nonperturbative mass saturation value is just under 1 tev for both processes .",
    "as a preliminary study based on perturbation theory has shown , it is expected that the nonperturbative mass saturation effect will play an important role in the experimental strategy for heavy higgs searches at the lhc .",
    "a comparison of the nonperturbative behaviour at strong coupling to the pattern observed in perturbation theory in higher loop orders suggests that radiative corrections in the scalar sector blow up very strongly at about 1 tev mainly because of the nonperturbative mass saturation effect , rather than because of a genuinely strong coupling . due to this dynamical effect the mass of the higgs boson , although widely used as a parameterization of the coupling in phenomenological studies so far , is not an appropriate parameter in the saturation region .    on the theoretical side",
    ", we have shown that in the case of the @xmath17-symmetric sigma model , a reliable nonperturbative solution can be obtained by using a higher order @xmath0 expansion , which is free of renormalization scheme ambiguities and which is valid at strong coupling as well .",
    "we discussed the tachyonic regularization which we introduced for calculating higher orders in the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "we also discussed the renormalization within the @xmath0 expansion in higher orders .",
