    "fast radio bursts ( frbs ) are millisecond - duration radio signals , first reported in 2007 @xcite and since then detected by the parkes , arecibo , and green bank telescopes between @xmath1 , primarily through processing of pulsar surveys and a few in the real - time detection pipeline . to date , 17 frbs have been published ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and two of them had been observed to repeat ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "fourteen of these sources have been detected at high galactic latitudes ( @xmath2 ) and their large dispersion measures ( dm @xmath3 ) exceed the expected galactic contribution predicted by the ne2001 model in the direction of the bursts @xcite , suggesting an extragalactic origin . however , no host galaxy has yet been confirmed for any of these events .",
    "@xcite proposed association of frb  150418 with an elliptical galaxy at redshift 0.5 ; however , @xcite and @xcite have demonstrated that the radio afterglow emission is instead due to agn variability . since the telescopes that are efficient in detecting these bursts are single - dish ,",
    "the beam sizes are typically a few arcminutes which makes the position uncertainty large , limiting the ability to identify the host galaxy .",
    "the excess dm suggests redshifts in the range @xmath4 for frbs if it originates from the intergalactic medium .",
    "given these circumstances , it is extremely difficult to associate an frb with a particular host galaxy unless there is some extraordinary evidence for coincident , transient multiwavelength emission within the beam .",
    "another class of transients , known as rrats are a group of galactic pulsars that emit sporadic pulses @xcite .",
    "there are about 112 rrats discovered so far and some of them have been observed at only one epoch or have been observed to emit only one pulse . before it was discovered that frb  121102 is repeating , @xcite discussed the uncertainty in the rrat / frb classification by analysing rrats from which only one pulse has been detected so far .",
    "but since we know of repeating frbs , there is no distinction between pulses from rrats and frbs .",
    "the only clear distinction is associated with their dm values .",
    "so , finding a host galaxy is really important at this point in order to constrain emission models for these bursts .",
    "since pulses from rrats are essentially indistinguishable from frbs , as explained in detail in   2 , we decided to find and confirm the origin of a subset of rrats that are close to the edge of the galaxy .",
    "taking into account the uncertainty in the free electron density model , these rrats could possibly have an extragalactic origin .",
    "the excess dm for our sample is not as high as seen in frbs , corresponding to very low redshifts at which the size of the host galaxy on the sky is comparable to the beam size of a single - dish telescope ( for example , the parkes beam has a hpbw of 14 ) .",
    "this similarity of scales would make the association , if found , more definitive than at cosmological distances .    in   2 we compare the most commonly used model for the galactic distribution with the newly available model to derive the dm distribution of radio transients on the sky . in ",
    "3 we outline the basic criterion used to choose our rrat sample . the results for each rrat candidate are discussed in   4 . in   5 we discuss the non - detection of host galaxies and related probabilities . finally , in   6 we summarize our results and present our conclusions .",
    "the ne2001 model @xcite describes the structure of ionised gas in the galaxy and is widely used to estimate distances to radio pulsars for which dm is the only distance indicator . in the case of frbs for which the dms are too high , this model is used to estimate the dm contribution in the direction of frb from the galaxy .",
    "this model is based on the observed dms of galactic radio pulsars and includes contributions from the thin disk associated with low - latitude hii regions , the thick - disk , the spiral arms , small - scale features corresponding to local ism , individual high - density clumps and voids . however , the uncertainty in the ne2001 model is about @xmath5 , particularly at higher latitudes , as also discussed in @xcite .",
    "recently , a new model by yao , manchester and wang , called as ymw16 has been proposed for the distribution of free electrons in the galaxy , the magellanic clouds , and the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) . this model is based on measurements from 189 pulsars with independently determined distances as well dms .",
    "we compared the two models by integrating both models to the edge of the galaxy for each radio transient s direction .",
    "the list of pulsars in the milky way , smc and the lmc is obtained from @xcite . the ratio ( @xmath6 ) of the measured dm to the maximum galactic dm versus the measured dm is plotted for the ne2001 model in @xcite .",
    "we show a similar plot for the ymw16 model in figure [ fig : dm - ymw16 ] .",
    "we can see that the galactic dm contribution is lowered along certain lines of sight towards the galactic center ( gc ) pulsars , minimizing the gap between gc pulsars and the overall pulsar population .",
    "pulsars in the lmc and smc and frbs , all have @xmath7 , consistent with the ne2001 model .",
    "a small fraction of pulsars have @xmath7 in both models , possibly due to uncertainties or them being in the galactic halo but we will not discuss these pulsars here .",
    "another promising difference between the two models is that all rrats had @xmath8 according to the ne2001 model , thus confirming their galactic origin ; however , according to the ymw16 model , some rrats now have shifted to having @xmath7 . assuming this model is closer to the true values than the ne2001 model , these rrats are very similar to frbs .",
    "this rrat sample provides a promising opportunity to find host galaxies that are close to us since their excess dm is much lower than most of the frbs .",
    "we also compared the pulse width and flux distributions for both rrats and frbs , as seen in figure [ fig : hist ] .",
    "the two sample kolmogorov - smirnov test gives @xmath9 and a p - value of 0.03 for the pulse widths , thus indicating that the pulse width distributions of the two populations are not significantly different .",
    "for the flux distribution , @xmath10 and the p - value is small ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "this is not surprising since the peak fluxes of known frbs are higher than rrats .    ) for all radio transients .",
    "the maximum galactic dm is calculated by integrating the ymw16 model to the edge of the galaxy for each transient s direction .",
    "the dashed line shows the maximum ratio expected for galactic objects if the electron density is accurate for all lines of sight . ]",
    "in an attempt to find host galaxies as discussed in   1 , we have selected a sample of rrats which have @xmath6 greater than 0.9 and for which @xmath12 is less than 10 @xmath13 as seen in figure [ fig : dmzoom ] .",
    "these rrats are at the edge of our galaxy and if the uncertainties in the electron density model are taken into account , they could be galactic or extragalactic .",
    "next , we discuss the individual rrat candidates which could possibly be frbs . if the dm due to the host galaxy is neglected and if the excess dm@xmath14 is assumed to be entirely due to the intergalactic medium , then we infer a redshift @xmath15 and distances up to @xmath16 .",
    "but since these rrats have low dm and the galactic @xmath17 uncertainties might be within this excess , we search for galaxies within 120 mpc ( corresponding to a dm @xmath18 for the local density of the intergalactic medium ) at the corresponding beam size based on the redshift information provided on ned .",
    "the summary is given in table  [ table : summaryt ] .",
    "the @xmath19 contribution is determined from the free electron density profile as a function of galecto - centric radius obtained by the latest model that fits best o viii observations ( see , figure 8 of @xcite ) .",
    "the number of objects found in ned within this search radius are listed in each subsection , and if the spectrum is available then their redshifts are determined by cross - correlating the spectrum against template spectra using the iraf task xvsao in the rvsao package .",
    "we also determined the variation in @xmath17 within the beam uncertainty using the ymw16 model for each rrat , as seen in figure  [ fig : dmall ] .",
    "the @xmath17 variation is within @xmath20 for all six rrats .        [",

    "follow - up observations detected no pulses from this rrat .",
    "the uncertainties in both the coordinates are @xmath22 , the 327 mhz beam radius .",

    "the 2dfgrs source found within the search radius of @xmath22 was at an inferred redshift of 0.07 , too high than expected , so it is unrelated to the rrat ( table  [ table : summaryt2 ] ) .",

    "4 that might be associated with any of the six rrats in our sample , these most likely do not have an extragalactic origin . for rrat j1603@xmath2118 , the dm@xmath26 contribution adds to match the measured dm and hence this rrat might be within the halo of our galaxy .",
    "we have also determined the dm associated with the local group by checking the direction of each of these rrats based on the right panel of figure 3 in @xcite , which yields a dm @xmath27 .",
    "rrats j1332@xmath2403 and j0156@xmath2104 could reside within the local group.the probability of finding a galaxy within the volume out to 120 mpc by chance for a beam radius of @xmath22 is @xmath28 , whereas for a beam radius of @xmath23 it is @xmath29 , based on the average number density of galaxies within the search volume , using ned .",
    "our null result is thus consistent with this estimate .",
    "we have presented a search for host galaxies in a subset of rrats that are at the edge of our galaxy .",

    "we did not find any nearby host galaxy associated with the six rrats in our sample .",
    "although finding nearby galaxies for such rrats that could possibly be frbs is a novel approach , the probability of actually finding a nearby host galaxy is low .",
