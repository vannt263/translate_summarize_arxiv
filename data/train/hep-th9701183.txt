    "one of the most important subject in the elementary particle physics is how to treat non - perturbative effect and how to obtain non - perturbative information .",
    "since the work of nambu - jona - lasinio(njl)@xcite , chiral symmetry breaking have been studied extensively in various models , e.g. qcd , strong coupling qed@xcite , gauged njl@xcite , etc .. particularly , the mechanism of dynamical mass generation has been applied to models beyond the standard model , for example , walking technicolor@xcite , top mode standard model@xcite , etc .. in these models , scalar 4-fermion interaction plays an important role .",
    "such a 4-fermion interaction in @xmath5 dimensions , the gross - neveu model@xcite , has been extensively studied .",
    "recently dynamical symmetry breaking and dynamical mass generation in the thirring model@xcite , which has vector - vector type 4-fermion interaction in @xmath0 dimensions@xmath1 , has been studied by many authors @xcite .",
    "usually the thirring model is studied in the form where the fermion has a minimal coupling with a massive vector boson through introduction of the vector auxiliary field .",
    "although this theory ( as well as original thirring model ) has no local gauge symmetry , several authors treated this massive gauge field as a genuine gauge field@xcite .",
    "itoh et al .",
    "@xcite have reformulated thirring model as a gauge theory by using the hidden local symmetry@xcite , and emphasized the advantage of maintaining such a manifest gauge symmetry in the analysis of thirring model in terms of sd equation .",
    "kondo@xcite further analyzed such a formulation in terms of the inversion method@xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to consider the critical behavior of the model in which the above two types of 4-fermi interaction coexist . actually , kim et al.@xcite studied such a model but without manifest gauge symmetry . due to each of the gauge symmetry their analysis of the sd equation",
    "unfortunately depends on their assumptions .    in this paper , we analyze gross - neveu model with thirring interaction by introducing hidden local symmetry and using the inversion method@xcite instead of sd equation .",
    "we obtained the generating functional of the next - to - leading order and the effective potential by the inversion method .",
    "the critical line is obtained in the parameter space @xmath6 where @xmath3 and @xmath7 are the dimensionless couplings of gross - neveu and thirring model , respectively , and @xmath8 is the number of fermions .",
    "the phase structure drastically changes at g=1 which is the critical coupling of the pure gross - neveu model at the leading order of @xmath2 expansion . for @xmath9 the phase structure",
    "is essentially determined by the gross - neveu interaction being only operative in the @xmath2-subleading corrections , while for @xmath10 , the the symmetry breaking take place only due to the subleading effects where the thirring interaction yields attractive force to form the condensate in contrast to the gross - neveu interaction which is opposite . following the procedure of ref.@xcite",
    ", we reformulate the original theory as a gauge theory in section [ hidden local symmetry ] . in section [ invpot ] and section [ critical ]",
    ", we calculate the effective potential for the chiral order parameter @xmath11 , by using the inversion method in @xmath2 expansion . based on this potential",
