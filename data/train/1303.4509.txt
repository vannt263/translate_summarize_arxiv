    "dipolar glass ( dg ) model provides a natural and attractive description of major transport properties of polar amorphous organic materials .",
    "initially , it was suggested for an explanation of the universal experimental observation of the poole - frenkel ( pf ) mobility field dependence @xmath0 in amorphous organic materials in a broad field range spanning almost two decades @xmath1 v / cm .",
    "@xcite this model could be considered as a further development of the gaussian disorder model ( gdm ) , @xcite which assumes that charge transport in organic materials occures as a series of hops in random gaussian energy landscape @xmath2 , created by contributions from randomly packed molecules .",
    "long ago borsenberger and bssler @xcite demonstrated that the gdm explains a strong polarity effect on carrier mobility by taking into account the dipolar as well as van der waals energetic disorder . yet , by the very nature of the gdm , it does not incorporate the most striking feature of the dipolar disorder , i.e. a long range spatial correlation of the random energy landscape,@xcite and for this reason can not adequately explains emergence of the pf dependence .",
    "in contrast with the gdm , dg model explicitly takes into account spatial correlations and naturally provides the pf field dependence in a wide field range .",
    "@xcite    initially , the dg model has been dubbed `` correlated disorder model '' ( cdm)@xcite , stressing the most important qualitative difference of the model with the gdm , but the proposed name describes better the true nature of the model . indeed , as it was shown in ref . ,",
    "different spatial correlations of the random energy landscape lead to the different field dependences of the mobility , hence the cdm name is too vague .",
    "the particular model , suggested and studied in refs .",
    ", is best suited for the description of transport properties of polar organic materials containing molecules having permanent dipole moments .    for the study of hopping charge transport in organic glasses a lattice version of the dg model",
    "is usually considered with sites of the regular lattice occupied by randomly oriented dipoles , and some of sites are considered as transport ones .",
    "earlier transport simulations for the dg model have been done for the case of the totally filled lattice where the fraction @xmath3 of sites occupied by transport molecules was equal to 1 .",
    "such simulations suggested that the temperature and field dependence of the mobility may be described by the phenomenological equation @xmath4 with @xmath5 and @xmath6.@xcite here @xmath7 is the magnitude of the energetic dipolar disorder and @xmath8 is the lattice scale .",
    "this particular relation has been widely used for a description of transport properties of various materials , we mention here just some recent references.@xcite in some papers a comparative analysis of the data using both the gdm and dg model was carried out and it was found that the dg model provides more coherent description of charge transport.@xcite still , a proper experimental test of the dg model is far from completed .    first , at the moment no simulation has been carried out for @xmath9 . the lattice model with @xmath10 is adequate for description of low molecular weight organic glasses , while polymeric materials , especially molecularly doped polymers , are certainly better described by the case @xmath9 . in this paper",
    "we provide results of the transport simulation for a partially filled lattice with @xmath11 to verify the validity of the pf relation for that case .",
    "numerous experiments demonstrate that the pf relation is generally valid for @xmath12 ; in addition , there is no theoretical reason to doubt its validity .",
    "indeed , a general picture of the carrier hopping in the correlated energy landscape suggests that major features of quasi - equilibrium non - dispersive transport is governed by the critical valleys with the size@xcite @xmath13 if the typical distance between transport sites @xmath14 is much less than @xmath15 @xmath16 one should not expect any significant modification of the pf dependence .",
    "it is worth noting that according to this line of reasoning , with the decrease of @xmath3 the mobility dependence initially begins to deviate from the strict pf law in the high field region . for @xmath17 v / cm , @xmath18 ev , and @xmath19 nm inequality ( [ condition ] ) gives @xmath20 at room temperature .",
    "nonetheless , a direct check of the validity of relation ( [ mu_pf ] ) for a partially filled lattice is highly desirable .",
    "next , the most important reason to perform the simulation for @xmath9 that uses set of transport parameters extracted from experimental data for a particular transport material is to provide a test of the self - consistency of the transport model .",
    "for quite a long time the gdm and dg model are used for the description of transport properties of organic materials , i.e. relevant transport parameters ( mostly @xmath7 ) are calculated using experimental mobility data according to the prescriptions of the particular model .",
    "all such prescriptions are provided by the phenomenological relations , based on the extensive monte carlo simulations.@xcite in this situation a very natural suggestion should be to perform a simple but very convincing test for the self - consistency of the model : to carry out the simulation for a given set of parameters ( experimental ones ) and then compare the results ( mostly , the simulated mobility field dependence ) with the experimental data . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "such comparison has been done neither for the gdm nor dg model . in this paper",
    "we present the result of such test for the particular set of transport parameters , extracted from the experimental mobility data for a typical organic semiconducting glass containing 30% ( by weight ) hole transporting aromatic hydrazone deh in polycarbonate ( pc ) matrix , and then compared our results with the experimental ones.@xcite experimental results , provided in different papers , agree well , thus justifying our choice of the reference transport material .",
    "last , earlier monte - carlo simulations @xcite demonstrated that time - of - flight ( tof ) current transients , predicted by the dg model , reproduce very well the experimental transients : there is a short spike reflecting initial spatial and energetic relaxation of carriers , followed by a flat plateau signaling emergence of the quasi - equilibrium transport with the mean carrier velocity independent of time , and then a final tail marking the arrival of carriers to the collecting electrode and typically having algebraic form @xmath21 with @xmath22 .    at the same time , a general behavior of transients was not well studied because the paper@xcite was entirely devoted to the study of an important but very particular effect of deep traps on the shape of transients . in this paper",
    "we study tof current shapes predicted by the dg model via monte carlo simulation for a partially filled lattice and compare simulated transients with the experimental ones for 30% deh : pc .",
    "again , we use this comparison as a test of the self - consistency of the dg model .",
    "realization of this program could provide the dg model with more strong footing .",
    "major assumptions of the dg model are well known . @xcite",
    "usually the model is considered as a regular cubic lattice with sites occupied by randomly oriented dipoles having dipole moment @xmath23 .",
    "we assume that orientation of dipoles is static and not affected by the applied uniform electric field @xmath24 .",
    "the dipoles generate a random spatial distribution of the electrostatic potential @xmath25 which immediately translates to the random site energy @xmath26 with zero mean and rms @xmath27 ev , depending on @xmath8 and @xmath23.@xcite particular energy distribution was obtained by the summation of contributions of all dipoles using the ewald method@xcite and assuming the periodic boundary conditions for the distribution of dipoles in the basic sample ; we assumed also that every site is occupied by a dipole .",
    "if the fraction of sites , occupied by dipoles , is not very low and the average distance between neighbor dipoles is comparable to @xmath8 , then the resulting distribution of @xmath28 has a gaussian form ; for low concentration of dipoles the tail of distribution decays more slowly .",
    "@xcite if the energy landscape has a gaussian distribution , then the only relevant parameter is @xmath7 ; fraction of sites , occupied by dipoles , the number of different sorts of dipoles , and the very nature of dipoles ( i.e. , are they transport sites or not ) are irrelevant for the problem .",
    "random energy landscape provided by dipoles has a particular property which is in drastic contrast to the gdm : a binary correlation function @xmath29 decays slowly with distance , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xcite while for the gdm this function is zero everywhere apart from @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",
    "long range correlation naturally leads to the pf dependence : the 1d transport model predicts that if @xmath34 , then @xmath35 .",
    "@xcite    in typical organic polar materials the actual random energy landscape @xmath2 incorporates contributions from other sources of energetic disorder : quadrupolar , @xcite van - der - waals , @xcite etc .",
    "the dipolar contribution stands apart because its correlation function decays more slowly than corresponding functions for other sources of disorder.@xcite this means that the dipolar disorder , when not negligible , provides the dominant contribution to the mobility field dependence for low and moderate fields.@xcite this fact justifies the use of a pure dipolar disorder ( i.e. , the dg model ) for description of the mobility field dependence in polar amorphous organic materials for a field range @xmath1 v / cm .",
    "our simulation technique is very close to the one , described previously.@xcite the only difference is that the fraction of sites , occupied by transport molecules is not @xmath10 but @xmath11 , thus providing connection with the experimental data for a particular well - characterized system , 30% deh : pc .",
    "@xcite we used the simplest assumption that sites of the lattice are occupied by transport molecules independently with probability @xmath3 ; the use of the simplest hypothesis is mostly related to the lack of relevant experimental information on the local structure of organic glasses .    in our simulations we examine a temporal dependence of the carrier velocity @xmath36 , averaged over many carriers for a particular realization of the random energy landscape @xmath2 , and then over realizations of @xmath2 .",
    "current transient @xmath37 in the tof experiment is directly proportional to @xmath36 .",
    "another important transport parameter , used for the calculation of the monte carlo carrier mobility , is a mean carrier velocity @xmath38 , where @xmath39 means the time for a carrier to reach the collecting electrode .",
    "we used the miller - abrahams ( ma ) hopping rate,@xcite where the rate of transition from site @xmath40 to site @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the prefactor frequency , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is a wave function decay parameter for transport sites ; in organic materials @xmath46.@xcite in the presence of applied electric field @xmath24 the site energy @xmath47 includes an additional term @xmath48 .",
    "it was found previously that details of the hopping rate are irrelevant to the emergence of the pf dependence ( [ mu_pf ] ) , at least for the case @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite    relevant physical parameters for the simulation were taken from the experimental transport data for 30 wt% deh : pc glass at room temperature.@xcite we used @xmath49 ev , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 ev . in these papers @xmath7",
    "was calculated using the gdm analysis of the low field mobility .",
    "the corresponding dg value @xmath53 could be obtained multiplying by the correction factor 10/9 .",
    "@xcite we did not perform this correction because it is well known that the coefficient @xmath54 in the relation @xmath55 valid for both gdm and dg model , is not a constant but depends on @xmath56.@xcite this dependence is rather weak around @xmath57 , but , nonetheless , it provides some uncertainty for a value of @xmath7 , calculated from the experimental mobility data .",
    "in addition , there may be a weak dependence of @xmath54 on @xmath3 as well .",
    "in this situation it is difficult to make a reliable but rather small correction from the gdm to dg model .",
    "exceptions are figs .",
    "[ pf_exp ] and [ universal144 ] , where simulation was performed using @xmath58 ev as well , in order to estimate the agreement between our simulation and experimental mobility data for 30% deh : pc .",
    "simulation time becomes prohibitively long to obtain good quality transients ( especially long - time tails ) using @xmath59 , while the corresponding simulation of a more robust integral transport parameter ( i.e. , the mobility ) still remains feasible . nonetheless , there is no doubt that the major features of transients ( such as universality , see section [ univ ] ) remain intact for the case of corrected @xmath7 .",
    "quite frequently a polaron ( or marcus ) hopping rate is considered as a more realistic alternative to the ma rate@xcite @xmath60,\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the polaron binding energy and we omit here the dependence on distance . for typical organic molecules used in transport materials",
    "intramolecular contribution to @xmath61 is 100 - 150 mev,@xcite and comparable intermolecular contribution could be expected . in this situation",
    "a major difference with the ma rate is an additional contribution @xmath62 to the effective activation energy @xmath63",
    ". significant effect on the shape of transients ( as well as on the mobility field dependence ) could be expected for rather exotic case of small @xmath64 mev , where transport is dominated by the quadratic term @xmath65 in and occurs in the inverted regime.@xcite this statement is supported by our preliminary data .",
    "detailed study of transients for the polaron hopping rate will be published elsewhere . at the same time , a possible polaronic contribution to the transport activation energy provides an uncertainty for the value of @xmath7 , estimated from the experimental data .",
    "unfortunately , at the moment there is no reliable method to extract polaronic contribution to the mobility temperature dependence .",
    "for this reason we assumed that all activation dependence originates from the random energy landscape .    in order to check the sensitivity of the simulation data to a finite size effect , mentioned in refs . , we performed simulation for basic samples with size @xmath66 equal to @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 lattice sites and found that the parameter , most sensitive to @xmath70 , is the absolute value of the mobility .",
    "mobility field dependence and relative shape of the transients are much less sensitive .",
    "for example , slope of the mobility field dependence @xmath71 in fig .",
    "[ pf_exp ] varies by 5% only and general features of transients remain the same . in addition",
    ", the finite size effect has been demonstrated for @xmath72 as a deviation of the mean carrier energy @xmath73 from the value @xmath74 , which is a mean carrier energy for @xmath72 and infinite number of sites in the case of the gaussian distribution ; for a finite @xmath70 @xmath75 .",
    "the reason for the deviation is scarcity of sites with low energy .",
    "however , for @xmath76 mean carrier energy increases with @xmath24 and becomes more close to the maximum of the density of states.@xcite for this reason the finite size effect becomes less severe for the simulation with @xmath77 .",
    "we should note two earlier papers where the monte carlo simulation of the hopping transport in amorphous organic materials for @xmath78 has been carried out assuming random distribution of hopping sites.@xcite contrary to our approach , simulation in ref .",
    "has been carried out for the gdm .",
    "sin and soos @xcite did not simulate transients and considered only the case of moderate disorder @xmath79 , while for 30% deh : pc and room temperature @xmath80 .",
    "in addition , they generated the correlated energy landscape in somewhat artificial way according to the method suggested by gartstein and conwell.@xcite this method gives short range spatial correlation and can not reproduce the proper spatial correlation in polar organic materials .",
    "some earlier papers considered the concentration dependence of the hopping mobility in organic materials using various analytic approaches.@xcite unfortunately , such approaches do not provide any information on the shape of transients .",
    "we found that the pf field dependence is valid for @xmath11 as well as for a fully filled lattice ( fig .",
    "[ pf_exp ] ) .",
    "deviation from the pf dependence begins around @xmath81 v / cm , reflecting the specific feature of the miller - abrahams hopping rate @xcite and effect of the decrease of the concentration of transport sites , mentioned in the introduction .",
    "this figure also shows that the dg model successfully passes the self - consistency test and simulation with parameters , extracted from experimental data , very well reproduce initial experimental field dependence .",

    "almost all discussions of the comparison of transport properties of organic materials with different concentrations of transport sites extensively use , albeit sometimes implicitly , the equivalent lattice approximation ( see , for example , recent refs . ) . conclusions of such discussions should be reexamined .",
    "it is natural to assume that the mobility curve for the totally filled lattice could be made more close to the experimental one by the addition of the effective spatial disorder according to the prescription of ref . because the addition of such disorder leads to the decrease of the slope @xmath111 of the mobility field dependence .",
    "however , in this approach the spatial disorder is introduced in a pure phenomenological manner without any possibility to predict a magnitude of disorder , necessary for the reproduction of the proper mobility field dependence .",
    "quite the contrary , in our approach a simple use of the proper concentration of transport molecules immediately provides a good description of the mobility field dependence .",
    "our results also provide good illustration on the importance of long range spatial correlations for the development of the proper mobility field dependence . sometimes in the literature one can find a statement that short range correlations are quite sufficient for the development of the field dependence which is almost indistinguishable from the true pf dependence in a wide field range and , hence , for a description of transport properties of organic materials ( a recent example is provided in ref . ) in order to understand the importance of long range correlations it is useful to compare our fig .",

    "[ v(l ) ] ) .",
    "mean velocity monotonously decreases with @xmath118 for the gdm , while for the dg model it is almost a constant for @xmath159 .",
    "this observation supports the conception of the breakdown of the this particular type of universality for the gdm , because for the validity of the mean velocity should be independent of @xmath118 . at the same time , dispersive transport in the gdm and dg model is not described by , because in both cases the corresponding values of @xmath160 are not equal for @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "this fact was already mentioned by bssler.@xcite fig .",
    "[ v(l ) ] provides additional support to unusual dispersion of transients in organic glasses , because if is valid , then @xmath163 , which does not agree with fig .",
    "[ v(l ) ] .",
    "we carried out monte carlo simulation of the hopping charge transport in the dg model with parameters ( @xmath7 and @xmath56 ) directly taken from the experimental data for the archetypical molecular doped polymer 30% deh : pc and assuming the simplest independent random distribution of deh transport molecules at the sites of a cubic lattice .",
    "we found that the mobility field dependence for moderate field in the dg model for @xmath11 retains its pf form , in good agreement with the general picture of the hopping transport in the correlated energy landscape .",
    "the most important parameter , namely slope of the mobility field dependence , was found to be very close to the experimental one .",
    "hence , for the dg model the simulation that uses the experimental parameters , derived from the temperature dependence of the low - field mobility ( @xmath7 ) and dependence of low field mobility on concentration of transport sites ( @xmath56 ) , is capable to reproduce well the mobility field dependence and shape of the transients .",
    "this agreement becomes even more convincing if one takes into account that for the model of equivalent 100% filled lattice the slope of the mobility field dependence and shape of transient are in striking disagreement with the experiment ( see figs .",
    "[ pf_exp ] and [ beta ] ) . and",
    "then , the simplest natural modification of the model ( i.e. , the use of partially filled lattice and assumption of the random independent spatial distribution of transport sites ) immediately brings simulated curves very close to the experimental ones .",
    "there is no need to introduce additional spatial disorder apart from the random distribution of transport site .",
    "we would like to emphasize an importance of this fact because recent survey suggested that the origin of the energetic disorder in molecular doped polymers and very nature of the activation energy of the hopping transport in these materials should be reconsidered.@xcite according to this study , activation energy of the hopping transport in molecularly doped polymers is mostly of the intramolecular origin .",
    "at the same time , there is a general belief that the energetic disorder with the magnitude @xmath18 ev is typical for amorphous organic materials .",
    "moreover , long range spatial correlation of the energy landscape is , at the moment , the only possible candidate for the explanation of the pf mobility field dependence.@xcite our simulation shows that it is possible to reproduce a typical field dependence in polar organic material ( i.e. , the dipolar glass with @xmath164 ev ) without using adjustable parameters and taking only a simplest assumption of the random distribution of hopping sites in the bulk of organic material . in this simulation the magnitude of the slope of the mobility dependence is directly dictated by the magnitude of the dipolar disorder .",
    "hence , the good agreement between our simulation and the experiment @xcite provides an addition support in favor of the existence of correlated energetic disorder with @xmath18 ev in organic materials . at the same time , as it was stressed in ref .",
    ", in polymers , doped with highly polar transport dopants , the magnitude of the total disorder , which presumably includes a significant and variable dipolar contribution , and calculated using the temperature dependence of the low field mobility , seemingly does not depend on the dopant concentration .",
    "this disagreement , why the dipolar disorder clearly reveals itself in the mobility field dependence and yet its contribution to the mobility temperature dependence is hidden , poses a major puzzle for the problem of carrier transport in amorphous organic materials .",
    "moreover , recent study casts doubt on the validity of the use of correlated models for description of the charge transport in polymers , in contrast with the transport properties of low molecular weight materials.@xcite the analysis was based on rather indirect comparison of the measured current - voltage curves with the predicted ones . at the same time ,",
    "much more simple and direct tof experiments unambiguously demonstrate that mobility field dependence agrees with predictions of the correlated model in both polymers and low molecular weight glasses , without any qualitative difference.@xcite quite possibly , that the disagreement found in ref . , also stems from the implicit use of the lattice gas model .",
    "new experiments on the concentration dependence of transport parameters with careful analysis of the transients along the lines suggested in ref . , as well as more thorough study of the simulated mobility dependence on the concentration of transport sites , are extremely desirable . at the same time",
    ", further comparison of the simulation data with experimental ones could be considered as a logical extension of our study .",
    "possible tests may include attempts to describe transformation of transients and variation of the slope of the mobility field dependence with temperature and concentration of transport molecules .",
    "a major difficulty for the realization of that programme is the scarcity of raw transient data in the literature.@xcite    we showed also that at the room temperature transients demonstrate universality with respect to @xmath118 and @xmath24 , and are non - dispersive according to the usual definition ( carrier mobility does not depend on @xmath118 , and the transient demonstrates a flat plateau if plotted in double linear @xmath165 vs @xmath166 coordinates ) . yet the shape of the transients differs significantly from the result of the simple diffusive approximation , which was suggested for the description of experimental tof transients.@xcite two major differences are the universality of the transients with respect to @xmath118 and power law decay of the tail .",
    "it is worth noting that universality with respect to @xmath118 naturally arises in the model where charge transport is described by the broad distribution of the effective carrier velocities,@xcite but universality with respect to @xmath24 can not be explained by this approach .",
    "it is also worth to note that the development of a flat plateau and simultaneous power law tail of the current with @xmath167 can not be described by the multiple trapping model , frequently used for the description of the hopping transport in random media.@xcite",
