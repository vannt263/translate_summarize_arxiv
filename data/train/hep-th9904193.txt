    "the casimir effect originally suggested in 1948 has been generally regarded as the contribution of a nontrivial geometry on the vacuum fluctuations of quantum electromagnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "the change in the vacuum fluctuations caused by the change of geometry appears as a shift of the vacuum energy and a resulting vacuum pressure . for a standard example , when we insert two perfectly conducting parallel plates into the free space @xmath1 , the plates are attracted towards each other  @xcite , although being uncharged .",
    "this attractive force is experimentally confirmed by sparnaay in 1958  @xcite and recently more precise measurements have been provided  @xcite .",
    "the dynamical casimir effect suggests that the nonuniform accelerative relative motion of the boundaries ( perfectly conducting plates or mirrors ) excites the electromagnetic field and promotes virtual photons from the vacuum into real photons  @xcite .",
    "the works on the dynamical casimir effect are pioneered by moore  @xcite and have progressed by many authors  @xcite .",
    "moore studied the quantum theory of a massless scalar field in the one - dimensional cavity bounded by moving mirrors , and evaluated the number of photons created by the exciting effect of the moving mirrors . in his approach ,",
    "the boundary condition on the scalar field is replaced with the simple equation , referred to as the moore s equation , which describes the constraint on the conformal transformation of the coordinate .",
    "his approach has been popularly used to investigate the problems relating to the @xmath2-dimensional dynamical casimir effect . for a well - known example fulling and",

    "the dynamical casimir effect occurs even in the adiabatic approximation .",
    "indeed , we can hardly handle the configurations except for the adiabatic deformations . here , _",
    "adiabatic _ means the absence of mixings among the different energy levels of the system during the modulation of the mirror separation . in other words",
    "the relative velocity of the mirrors is much smaller than the velocity of light .",
    "especially sassaroli _ et al .",
    "_ succeeded in evaluating the number of photons produced by the adiabatic motion of the mirrors in @xmath3 dimensions  @xcite .",
    "they used the bogolubov transformation among the creation and annihilation operators of photon in order to describe the particle production .",
    "the similar phenomena of the particle production also have been predicted in a variety of general - relativistic situations  @xcite .",
    "such phenomena include the hawking radiation from black holes  @xcite , the domain - wall activity in cosmology , and the high - speed collision of atomic nuclei  @xcite .",
    "although these phenomena are interesting , the dynamical casimir effect has not yet been experimentally confirmed .",
    "if moving mirrors create radiation , the mirrors experience a radiation - reaction force .",
    "several authors have discussed this subject within the adiabatic approximation .",
    "_ showed the existence of the additional negative frictional force besides the static casimir force in the one - dimensional cavity by using moore s equation  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of moore s approach is the properties : the theory does not need to possess the hamiltonian or the lagrangian to describe the time evolution of the field .",
    "however , it seems difficult to apply moore s approach to study the casimir effects and its backreaction in @xmath4 or @xmath3 dimensions because the boundary condition of the one - dimensional space plays a crucial role in his approach .    in this paper",
    "we present an effective - theoretical approach to studying the casimir effects in @xmath5 dimensions .",
    "our approach , making use of the action , is considered to be applicable to study the casimir effects and its back reaction also in the higher dimensions . in general",
    "the existence of the moving boundaries ( mirrors ) makes it difficult to construct the hamiltonian or the lagrangian describing the system , since the relative motion of the boundaries ( mirrors ) mixes one energy level of the system with the others .",
    "however , we note that the adiabatic motion allows us to neglect this boundary effect : we do not need the boundaries .",
    "so we replace the spatial configuration @xmath6 into @xmath0 in the adiabatic approximation .",
    "the motion of the cavity size is described by varying the radius of @xmath0 in time .",
    "furthermore , we can naturally identify the size of space @xmath0 with the scale factor of the robertson - walker - type metric .",

    ", we can study the casimir effects from the viewpoint of the effective theory .",
    "the construction of the model with the replacement is very simple and general , so that it is easy to apply our approach to more realistic models in the higher dimensions by replacing the space @xmath8 into @xmath9 .    to check the validity of our replacement ,",
    "we construct a scalar model and calculate the casimir effects .",
    "as is usual our model makes use of the conformal symmetry property of the two - dimensional theory of massless fields . in our model of the cavity - system the classical action is constructed by the classical kinetic term of the mirror separation and the polyakov action .",
    "the polyakov action describes the massless scalar field minimally coupling to the two - dimensional gravity .",
    "the classical action is simple and general , so the structure of the model , e.g. , symmetry , is easily visible .",
    "we carry out the path integral on the scalar field , and obtain the effective action for the mirror separation .",
    "the calculation of the path integral is rather complicated ; however , it can be exactly performed .",
    "the effective action consists of the classical kinetic term of the mirror separation and the quantum correction terms .",
    "the quantum correction takes a well - known form , which consists of the static casimir energy term and the conformal anomaly term .",
    "the conformal anomaly term represents the back reaction of the dynamical casimir effect .",
    "the effective action finally leads to the dynamical vacuum pressure depending on the relative velocity of the mirrors .",
    "our approach also gives an explanation for the origins of the casimir effects in terms of the effective theory : the casimir effects are caused by the change of field configuration in the vacuum instead of the existence of the boundaries .",

    "our approach , however , describes both the static and the dynamical casimir effects together , and is applicable to more realistic models in the higher dimensions by replacing the space @xmath8 into @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , the existence of the action makes it easy for us to compare our model with others .",
    "for example , our model has a correspondence to the callan , giddings , harvey , strominger ( cghs ) model which describes the two - dimensional dilaton black hole  @xcite .",
    "the back reaction discussed in this paper is comparable to the back reaction of the hawking radiation from the cghs black hole  @xcite . in the cghs model the hawking radiation",
    "is represented by the conformal anomaly in the energy - momentum tensor  @xcite , and the back reaction of the radiation , which is described by the polyakov - liouville action , appears as the decrease in the black - hole mass  @xcite .",
    "our classical kinetic term in the semi - classical effective action ( [ semiclaction.eq ] ) corresponds to the kinetic term of the dilaton in the cghs model .",
    "some comments are in order .",
    "the quantum correction ( [ effactionresult1.eq ] ) does not include the third derivative of the dynamical variable .",
    "this looks different from the results evaluated by fulling and davies  @xcite .",
    "they calculated the energy - momentum tensor in ( 1 + 1)-dimensional system of two relatively moving mirrors  @xcite as well as that in ( 1 + 1)-dimensional system of a single non - uniformly accelerating mirror  .",
    "both energy - momentum tensors include the third derivative of the dynamical variables .",
    "our result for the system of two mirrors does not need to coincide with their result for the system of a single mirror since the forms of the conformal anomaly for two systems are different .",
    "the result for the system of a single mirror is due to the unruh - like effect rather than due to the dynamical casimir effect . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy - momentum tensor derived from eq .",
    "( [ effactionresult1.eq ] ) coincides with their result for the system of two mirrors under a certain transformation of the dynamical variable .    in the semiclassical effective action ( [ semiclaction.eq ] ) ,",
    "the contribution from the dynamical casimir effect generated a negative - definite kinetic term of the mirror separation .",
    "such a kinetic term also appeared in the analysis of the cghs model  @xcite .",
    "the following point should be noted : there is a positive - definite classical kinetic term , and the negative - definite term gives only a slight correction .",
    "this holds in the case where the mass scale of the mirrors @xmath13 is much greater than the scale of the casimir energy @xmath138 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the mirror separation @xmath12 is smaller than the inverse of the mirror mass @xmath139 , our result ( [ dynamicalforce.eq ] ) shows that the dynamical casimir force @xmath131 becomes repulsive .",
    "however , our semiclassical treatment becomes unsuitable at that time .",
    "when the motion of the mirror separation obeys the quantum mechanics , this repulsive force might be realized .",
    "we will leave this problem to subsequent developments .",
