    "in the geometrical optics of a `` quenched '' medium with static spatial variations in refractive index , or in the combustion of a heterogeneous solid propellant , each spatial point is characterized by a local speed @xmath0 at which a wave front or flame sheet can advance normal to itself in accordance with huygens principle @xcite .",
    "a key problem is to determine the time needed for an influence ( light or combustion ) to propagate from one region of space to another ; fermat s principle asserts that the propagation effectively occurs along all possible trajectories that obey the local speed @xmath0 , with the first - arriving trajectory giving the desired answer .",
    "a preliminary connection with statistical mechanics is suggested by writing the travel time for a spatial path @xmath1 as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the path length , @xmath4 is a spatial average over the medium , and @xmath5 is a zero - mean field .",
    "we can interpret @xmath1 as a material curve  a polymer string  and @xmath6 as its potential energy , with @xmath4 being the constant tension and @xmath7 an external potential .",
    "the polymer is infinitely flexible , since there is no curvature energy in eq .",
    "( [ tc ] ) . and the polymer is `` directed '' because each endpoint is confined to a different region of space .",
    "fermat s principle requires us to find the minimum - energy configuration ( classical ground state ) of this directed polymer .",
    "so far this is just a complicated optimization problem , but it can be made more explicitly statistical in two ways .",
    "first , in many cases of interest , @xmath7 is a homogeneous random field with specified statistics , and we are satisfied with calculating the ensemble - averaged propagation time or minimum energy ( which , for a very long polymer , nearly equals the minimum energy in a single realization of @xmath7 ) .",
    "second , even within a given realization of the potential , it may be convenient to consider the canonical ensemble of directed - polymer configurations at finite temperature , calculate the thermodynamic free energy , and then take the zero - temperature limit to obtain the ground - state energy .",
    "the most powerful theoretical methods arise from combining both types of ensemble .",
    "this paper focuses on the case in which @xmath7 is a homogeneous and isotropic ( but not necessarily gaussian ) random field that is small in magnitude compared to @xmath4 . in this weak - fluctuation limit",
    ", there is in fact a more general and useful relation between propagation and directed polymers , one that applies even to random media with time dependence and advection , such as turbulent fluids . in this paper , we focus on the quenched - medium interpretation of the analysis , but relate our approach to turbulent combustion and other applications when useful . as was recently shown @xcite , the propagation of huygens fronts in a broad class of weakly random @xmath8-dimensional media reduces to the @xmath9-dimensional inviscid burgers equation with white - in - time forcing .",
    "furthermore , the statistical properties of the inviscid burgers dynamics are equivalent to those of viscous `` burgers turbulence '' ( with the same forcing ) in the limit of vanishing viscosity @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the white - noise - driven viscous burgers equation , in turn , has a known relation to the canonical ensemble for a near - straight directed polymer ( at a temperature proportional to @xmath10 ) in a @xmath8-dimensional static random potential that is white in one direction @xcite .",
    "this is precisely the kind of random potential commonly assumed in theoretical directed - polymer studies @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ relations ] we systematically discuss some known relations among different theoretical representations of our problem , and indicate how the recent results can be linked with this framework to allow calculation of the speedup of huygens fronts . in sec .",
    "[ monotonicity ] we describe three rigorous `` monotonicity properties '' obeyed by random huygens propagation , which provide not only checks on our later results but also further implications from them . in sec .",
    "[ replica ] we present the replica method in a form suited to our problem , and derive explicit upper bounds on the front speedup . in sec .",
    "[ numerical ] we review existing numerical simulations that provide relevant speedup values for comparison , and describe our new higher - precision simulation results .",
    "a summary and discussion are presented in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation for interface growth @xcite is well known as a unifying model for diverse phenomena .",
    "the equation can be written @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a fluctuation in the height of an interface as a function of @xmath13 transverse dimensions and time , @xmath14 is a surface tension that smooths the interface , and @xmath15 is a zero - mean external perturbation ( not necessarily the white noise assumed by kpz ) . equation ( [ kpz ] ) is equivalent to the @xmath9-dimensional forced viscous burgers equation @xmath16 for the velocity field @xmath17 , and also to the @xmath18-dimensional imaginary - time schrdinger equation for the `` wave function '' @xmath19 , with potential @xmath20 and planck s constant @xmath21 .",
    "the solution of this schrdinger equation is given by the feynman path integral @xcite @xmath22\\biggr).\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    the simplest connection between these ideas and huygens propagation is to assume a quenched medium with weak refractive - index fluctuations given by a smooth function @xmath23 , and to write the position of a nearly flat front as the unperturbed position plus a small displacement : @xmath24 in units where @xmath25 .",
    "we can approximate the incremental speed @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ kpz ] ) as the negative of the index fluctuation at the unperturbed location , i.e. , @xmath26 . equation ( [ kpz ] ) then governs the dynamics of @xmath27 , with the nonlinear term describing the leading - order effect of tilted propagation , and the laplacian term smoothing the cusps ( or burgers shocks ) that would otherwise develop .",
    "( we work to leading order in the fluctuation @xmath7 and the tilt @xmath28 , neglecting their higher - order and joint effects . )",
    "the parameter @xmath10 , which corresponds to the markstein length in premixed flamelet combustion @xcite , contributes a stabilizing dependence of front speed on local curvature , with concave regions propagating faster than convex regions .",
    "pure huygens propagation is obtained as a `` viscosity solution '' in the @xmath29 limit @xcite .",
    "a useful alternative description is based on a field @xmath30 giving the time at which the front reaches a given point . from eq .",
    "( [ xth ] ) , we see that to leading order @xmath31 thus , in the weak - fluctuation framework , we are free to write @xmath32 in place of @xmath33 as an independent variable and interpret @xmath34 as the time deviation . with this perspective , the path integral ( [ feyn ] ) is , upon suitable normalization , the canonical partition function for the simple `` fermat s principle '' directed polymer described in the introduction . with weak fluctuations , only paths that are nearly aligned with the @xmath32-direction are competitive in travel time ( energy ) .",
    "such a path , described by a function @xmath35 so that @xmath36 , has arc - length element @xmath37\\\\ & = \\int du\\ , [ 1 + \\tfrac{1}{2 } |\\mathbf{y}'(u)|^2 + \\sigma\\bm{(}u,\\mathbf{y}(u)\\bm { ) } ] .",

    "consequently , @xmath30 is the free energy of this polymer . as expected , eq .",
    "( [ partf ] ) indicates that @xmath41 approaches the absolute minimum travel time ( ground - state energy ) in the huygens - propagation limit @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath7 is a homogeneous random field , we expect the free energy @xmath41 to scale linearly with the longitudinal extent @xmath32 of the polymer in the thermodynamic limit @xmath42 .",
    "since the ground - state energy in the absence of fluctuations would be just @xmath32 , we define the binding energy per unit length as @xmath43 which is independent of @xmath44 by homogeneity , and is positive because the nonlinear term in eq .",
    "( [ kpz ] ) makes @xmath27 increase on average .",
    "this nonlinear term equals @xmath45 , and so @xmath46 can also be described as the steady - state energy density of the burgers fluid .",
    "[ the other two terms on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ kpz ] ) average to zero because @xmath27 is statistically homogeneous in @xmath44 and @xmath47 is a centered perturbation . ]",
    "the effect of the weak fluctuations @xmath7 , whose rms value we denote by @xmath48 , is to renormalize the overall front speed upward to @xmath49 .",
    "our analysis applies to the asymptotic limit @xmath50 and is expected to be accurate when the dimensionless parameter @xmath51 is small ; previous numerical work @xcite discussed in sec .",
    "[ existing ] indicates that the asymptotic scaling holds within a few percent for @xmath52 .      for media of a given structure , with fluctuations related by overall rescaling ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath53 as @xmath50 ; but the form of this dependence is subtle . if @xmath10 is fixed , then for sufficiently small @xmath51 , eq .",
    "( [ kpz ] ) can be linearized ; the lowest - order solution for @xmath27 is proportional to @xmath51 and thus the nonlinear term ( producing the secular growth of @xmath27 measured by @xmath46 ) is proportional to @xmath54 .",
    "this is the weak - perturbation scenario normally associated with the kpz equation , corresponding to a laminar solution of the viscous burgers equation ( [ burgers ] ) . on the other hand , if we take @xmath29 at finite @xmath51 to obtain huygens propagation , and only then take @xmath50 , the linearization is invalid ( because the burgers flow is fully turbulent ) and the scaling of @xmath46 with @xmath51 is not immediately obvious .",
    "subject to mild conditions on the medium structure , we have shown mathematically @xcite that @xmath55 in this regime , confirming a previous conjecture @xcite .",
    "here we provide a somewhat more physical argument based on dimensional analysis .",
    "let us denote by @xmath56 and @xmath57 some measures of the longitudinal and lateral correlation lengths of @xmath7 , and consider the behavior of the inviscid burgers equation upon varying these quantities and @xmath51 , while keeping fixed all other details of the statistics of @xmath7 .",
    "we can perform dimensional analysis on the kpz equation ( [ kpz ] ) , with @xmath58 and @xmath59 , by assigning the conventional dimensions from the burgers - fluid interpretation : @xmath60 = [ \\nabla_\\perp h ] = { \\mathsf{l } } { \\mathsf{t}}^{-1 } , \\quad [ h ] = { \\mathsf{l}}^2 { \\mathsf{t}}^{-1 } , \\quad [ \\alpha_\\parallel ] = { \\mathsf{t}},\\nonumber\\\\ [ \\alpha_\\perp ] = { \\mathsf{l } } , \\quad [ \\eta ] = [ \\epsilon ] = { \\mathsf{l}}^2 { \\mathsf{t}}^{-2 } , \\quad [ \\delta ] = { \\mathsf{l}}^2 { \\mathsf{t}}^{-2}.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] ( these dimensions are unusual from the viewpoint of propagation because the longitudinal and lateral directions are treated differently . ) the most general dimensionless combination of input parameters is a function of @xmath61 . accordingly , @xmath62 where we have taken advantage of the freedom to choose any combination of parameters with the dimensions of @xmath46 to multiply @xmath63 .",
    "( we could equally well have chosen @xmath51 or @xmath64 . )",
    "the reason for our choice is that if we take @xmath65 while scaling @xmath66 , so that @xmath7 becomes white noise in the longitudinal ( time ) direction , then the coefficient of @xmath63 is unaffected . assuming that the inviscid burgers equation is well behaved with white - in - time forcing , so that @xmath46 remains finite",
    ", we can partially constrain the function @xmath67 . the fact that @xmath68 as @xmath65 is of no concern here , because the sole formally dimensionless measure of the strength of @xmath51 is @xmath69 , which is approaching zero .",
    "we conclude that @xmath63 has a finite limit as @xmath70 .",
    "now , keeping the correlation lengths fixed but taking @xmath50 ( which also gives @xmath70 ) , we see that @xmath55 .    our mathematical analysis @xcite demonstrated this result more seamlessly , starting from the exact equations of huygens propagation ( rather than from the kpz equation ) , extracting a factor @xmath71 by a rescaling of variables , and directly obtaining the white - noise - driven inviscid burgers equation as @xmath50 .",
    "( to make the argument used in this paper more complete , in appendix [ appkpz ] we provide a mathematical justification for starting from the kpz equation . ) furthermore , we showed that the effect of an advecting velocity field @xmath72 of order @xmath51along with possible time dependence of @xmath7 and @xmath72 on a natural timescale of order @xmath73is given as @xmath50 by simply adding @xmath74 to @xmath7 and considering the medium as quenched at the initial time .",
    "that is , both the component @xmath75 and the time dependence of the medium become irrelevant .",
    "if we reintroduce the viscosity ( markstein length ) @xmath10 , with conventional dimensions @xmath76 , there is a new dimensionless parameter that remains fixed in the white - noise limit : the burgers - fluid reynolds number @xmath77 . to maintain huygens propagation ( corresponding to very large @xmath78 ) as @xmath50 , we must decrease @xmath10 at least as fast as @xmath79 . in our previous analysis , we cited mathematical results @xcite establishing that the white - noise - driven steady state of the inviscid burgers equation exists , and is approached by that of the viscous burgers equation as @xmath80",
    ". thus there is no subtlety with interchange of the limits @xmath50 and @xmath80 , as there was with @xmath50 and @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ kpz ] ) .",
    "previously @xcite we denoted by @xmath10 what we here call @xmath81 .",
    "let us emphasize that @xmath78 is distinct from the hydrodynamic reynolds number @xmath82 for weak advection by a turbulent navier - stokes flow . in such a flow , we have @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( where we have now returned to units in which @xmath85 , so that @xmath86 and @xmath51 is dimensionless ) .",
    "assuming near - equality between the flame parameter @xmath10 ( arising from thermal diffusivity ) and the hydrodynamic viscosity @xmath87 , as is valid for gaseous combustion , we have @xmath88 for @xmath48 .",
    "thus the burgers turbulence is more fully developed than the hydrodynamic turbulence , and the huygens limit @xmath80 is not incompatible with the physics of gaseous flames .",
    "the quantitative implications of the white - noise reduction follow from eq.([dim ] ) .",
    "we consider altering a given physical field @xmath7 ( rms value @xmath48 ) by multiplying the correlation length @xmath56 by @xmath79 ( compressing in the longitudinal direction ) and multiplying @xmath7 everywhere by @xmath89 .",
    "the new field then has an rms value @xmath90 .",
    "the parameter @xmath69 for the new field is unchanged from the original , and so @xmath46 is multiplied by @xmath89 , based on the coefficient of @xmath63 .",
    "thus we have removed the @xmath71 dependence , and the new @xmath46 is the prefactor . in the @xmath50 limit , the spectrum of the noise @xmath91 , obtained by altering the original field @xmath7 as described , becomes    @xmath92    here we have observed that the @xmath93 term is negligible because the correlation function with the argument @xmath94 vanishes as @xmath50 for all nonzero @xmath32 , and we have then rescaled the integration variable @xmath32 .",
    "the spectrum is white in the longitudinal direction because there is no dependence on @xmath95 .",
    "the @xmath96 factor simply normalizes the original @xmath7 correlation function to unit variance .",
    "thus the desired prefactor of @xmath71 in the huygens - front speedup is the value of @xmath46 obtained using the path integral ( [ feyn ] ) in the @xmath97 limit , with the spectrum ( [ deta ] ) for @xmath47 . in other words ,",
    "the prefactor is the ground - state binding energy per unit length for the `` directed polymer '' with energy @xmath98.\\ ] ] ( the ground - state energy would be zero in the absence of fluctuations , and so the binding energy is simply the negative of the free energy . )",
    "although this is the system most commonly referred to as a directed polymer in a random potential , we observe that the white noise @xmath47 is in no sense small , and thus @xmath99 is not an accurate approximation to an incremental arc length .",
    "the energy ( [ h ] ) is to be considered on its own terms , separate from the original intuition about a flexible string with tension . in particular , to use a supposedly more accurate square - root expression for arc length in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) would be incorrect for our purposes .",
    "remarkably , the idealizations conventionally adopted to render the physical directed polymer more tractable ( quadratic expansion of arc length , white - noise potential ) are precisely justified in the problem of weakly perturbed huygens propagation .",
    "it is intuitively reasonable that a more vigorous forcing of the burgers equation should result in a higher steady - state energy density , and correspondingly that a random medium with greater fluctuations should result in faster propagation .",
    "more precisely , let us consider the @xmath29 limit of the path integral ( [ partf ] ) for two different homogeneous weakly random media , labeled 1 and 2 , and assume that at every wave vector the spectrum of @xmath100 is no greater than that of @xmath101 . because the spectra of independent random fields are additive",
    ", we can obtain a field @xmath102 with the same spectrum as @xmath101 by defining @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a zero - mean gaussian random field ( independent of @xmath100 ) with an everywhere nonnegative spectrum given by subtraction . according to eq.([deta ] ) , as @xmath50 , the speedup is governed entirely by the spectrum ( or equivalently the two - point correlation function ) of the medium fluctuations , and so @xmath102 gives the same speedup as @xmath101 .",
    "now we observe that the fastest path from the initial front to a given point in the field @xmath100 , which we denote @xmath105 ( with travel time @xmath106 ) , can be considered as a possible path in the field @xmath102 . there",
    ", its travel time is different by an amount @xmath107 the fastest path in the field @xmath102 must have a travel time no greater than @xmath108 . the ensemble average over @xmath102 can then be performed in two steps , thanks to the statistical independence of @xmath104 and @xmath100 .",
    "first , upon averaging over @xmath104 for a given realization of @xmath100 , the mean of @xmath109 is zero and so the `` partial average '' first - arrival time for @xmath102 is no greater than @xmath106 .",
    "second , upon averaging over @xmath100 , the mean of @xmath106 is ( obviously ) the average first - arrival time for @xmath100 .",
    "consequently , the `` complete average '' first - arrival time for @xmath102 ( or @xmath101 ) is no greater , and the speedup no smaller , than for @xmath100 .",
    "this monotonicity property does not immediately relate the prefactors @xmath46 of @xmath71 for different media , because two different spectra with the same total power @xmath54 can not obey the assumed inequality .",
    "but relations can be obtained by considering media with @xmath51 differing as little as possible such that one spectrum is bounded by the other , and then correcting the result with the known @xmath71 scaling . the necessary discrepancy in @xmath51 ( which weakens the prefactor relation )",
    "can be reduced by performing an optimally chosen spatial rescaling of one of the media , which does not affect its huygens - front speedup .",
    "for each of our four example spectra , table [ num ] gives the parameters @xmath110 of the most refined simulation performed , and the resulting extrapolated estimate of @xmath46 including both statistical and systematic uncertainties ."
