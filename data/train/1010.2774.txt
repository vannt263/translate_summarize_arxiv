    "combined with the _ spitzer _ glimpse @xcite and mipsgal @xcite surveys that cover the dust sed from 3.6 to 24@xmath1 m , light mostly emitted by the smallest grains ( a@xmath10 nm ) , we will for the first time reliably sample the full dust sed of the diffuse emission at all spatial scales down to @xmath11 and over a large fraction of the galactic plane .    at 70 and 160@xmath1 m",
    "many of the observed structures show a close spatial correlation with some of the classical infrared tracers of small dust particles , like the emission measured at 8 and 24@xmath1 m , and therefore , one expects a partially similar origin and/or a similar dependence to ism physical properties .",
    "to properly understand the origin of this emission is the first step of the data analysis .",
    "dust is heated by stellar ultraviolet(uv)-visible photons and re - radiate the absorbed energy in the infrared . assuming some dust properties , this dust emission is widely used to trace crucial quantities like cloud masses or star forming activity .",
    "however , to derive accurately these quantities requires to take into account the dust properties evolution , how it affects its emission and how it reflects the ism properties . on the other hand , dust plays a crucial role for the ism physics and chemistry . since dust and the rest of ism are tightly interlock ,",
    "changes on the dust properties affect those of the gas phase .",
    "it is then necessary to characterize the physical processes responsible for the dust evolution to assess their role within the ism lifecycle and to be able to use dust as a reliable tracer of the ism .",
    "accessing the full dust sed over a large fraction of the sky allows to follow the behavior of every dust component over a broad range of physical conditions which is an invaluable information for the study of the dust evolution .    in this paper , we present the first analysis of the hi - gal data combined with that of glimpse and mipsgal to obtain the full dust sed from 8 to 500@xmath1 m . in the section[sect : obs ] , we describe the observations and the fitting method that makes use of a physical dust model , dustem @xcite . in the section[sect : results ] , we present and discuss the results and how our analysis method allows us to better interpret the behavior of extended emission observed with the _ herschel / spitzer _ photometers .",
