    "experimental and theoretical investigations of plasmon excitations in metallic nanocrystals have received recently much attention due to possible applications in photo - voltaics and microelectronics .",
    "a significant enhancement of absorption of the incident light in photodiode - systems with active surface covered with metallic particles ( of au , ag or cu ) , with radius ten to several tens nanometers and with planar density @xmath0/@xmath1 , was observed@xcite .",
    "this is due to mediating of light energy transfer by surface plasmon oscillations in metallic nano - components .",
    "these findings are of practical importance towards enhancement of solar cell efficiency especially for thin film cell technology . on the other side , hybridized states of surface plasmons and photons result in plasmon - polaritons@xcite which are of high significance for applications in sub - diffractional photonics and microelectronics@xcite    for finite size crystals where the surface strongly affects the plasmon spectrum ,",
    "surface plasmons occur and dominate the electro - magnetic ( e - m ) response of the metallic system .",
    "a strong dependence of resonance surface plasmon frequencies on the nanoparticle size and shape are reported in the literature@xcite .",
    "the plasmon resonances of noble metals , such as gold and silver ( including also copper ) , are of particular interest due to their frequencies located within the visible part of the e - m spectrum .    plasmon oscillations in metallic nanospheres can be excited by time - dependent electric field signal .",
    "there are different types of plasmon oscillations in the case of metallic nanoparticle .",
    "general types are volume and surface plasmons , referring to oscillations of internal electron density and surface electron density , respectively .",
    "the surface plasmons are linked to translational motion of all electrons which results in surface density oscillations only .",
    "the volume modes are related to compressional oscillations .",
    "note that separation of these both types of collective excitations of electrons in metallic nanocrystal repeats the similar distinguishing of collective modes in atomic nuclei@xcite ( confirmed by giant resonance experiments ) . for metallic ultra - small clusters with number @xmath2 of electrons ( in the range form @xmath3 to @xmath4 in",
    "na clusters)@xcite the decoupling of volume and surface excitations is demonstrated by microscopic modeling@xcite at approximately @xmath5 .",
    "for ultra - small metallic clusters quantum shell effects@xcite and spill - out of electron cloud beyond the ionic jellium@xcite disturb separate formation of surface and volume collective excitations , while for large clusters ( with radius larger than 10 nm ) the role of shells and spill - out is considerably reduced@xcite , and both modes are well defined .    in order to excite the volume type oscillations an electric dynamical field inhomogeneous on the nanosphere scale is necessary while a homogeneous field excites only surface plasmons . for spherical symmetry ,",
    "all modes of plasmon oscillations can be represented by spherical harmonics in terms of @xmath6 , angular momentum ( multiplicity ) numbers .",
    "a dynamical electric field homogeneous over the sphere can induce only @xmath7 , i.e. , dipole - type surface oscillations .",
    "the surface plasmons have been originally considered by mie@xcite , who provided a classical description of oscillations of electrical charge on the surface of the metallic sphere within the classical model .",
    "the dipole - type mie oscillation energy is not dependent of the sphere radius , in contradiction to experimental observations , both in the case of small and larger nanospheres . for low radius , of order of single nanometers , besides mentioned above spill - out , the electron - electron interactions are important@xcite ( including decay of plasmons into particle - hole pairs with similar energy , called as landau damping@xcite)these quantum effects influence on position of resonance frequency",
    ". for large spheres , with radius bigger than 10  nm , even stronger shifts of resonance are observed , probably connected with another mechanism , since with radius growth quantum effects turn out to be not so important as for ultra - small clusters .",
    "the case of bigger nanospheres is , however , of particular significance as such metallic nano - components would be applied to enhancement of photo - voltaic effect in metallically modified solar cells@xcite .",
    "plasma excitations in metallic clusters were analyzed within many attitudes , addressed , however , mostly to small clusters .",
    "in particular were developed numerical methods of calculus ab initio including kohn - sham local density approximation [ lda ] , similar as applied in chemistry for large molecule calculations ( limited , however , to few hundreds of electrons)@xcite .",
    "also variational methods for energy density , semiclassical approach@xcite and random - phase - approximation ( rpa ) numerical summations were applied ( e.g. , for clusters of na with radius @xmath8nm)@xcite .",
    "emerging of the mie response from the more general description was analyzed , but including only ( in a numerical manner ) single breathing volume mode@xcite .",
    "commonly the jellium model was applied , allowing for adiabatic approach to background ion system . in the jellium model",
    "all the kinetics concerns electron liquid screened by uniform and static background of positive ions@xcite .",
    "below we present the simplified rpa - type theory of plasmon excitations in metallic nanosphere embedded in dielectric medium adjusted to large nanospheres ( with radius above 10 nm ) , when quantum corrections beyond semiclassical approximation are not so significant as in the case of ultra - small clusters@xcite . for optically induced plasma oscillations ,",
    "the wavelength of incident light which excites resonance oscillations in metallic nanospheres ( au and ag within several to several tens nm for radius ) is considerably longer ( @xmath9 nm ) than nanosphere dimension .",
    "thus , the dipole - type approximation is valid , i.e. , one can assume that the electric field of the incident e - m wave is homogeneous over the nanosphere .",
    "therefore , only dipole type oscillations of surface plasmons will contribute the resonance ( except for limiting big nanospheres , when also volume excitations seem to enter e - m response due to not exact dipole approximation ) .",
    "the experimentally observed red - shift of dipole mie plasmon resonance for ultra - small clusters is caused mainly by significant spill - out effect reducing density of electrons@xcite .",
    "the mie frequency is proportional to square root of the electron density and thus one arrives with reduced its value due to spill - out beyond the edge of ion jellium . with growing radius this effect weakens , as being of surface type and thus proportional to inverse radius , quite oppositely as red - shift observed for bigger nanospheres . for the radius over 10",
    "nm the red - shift experimentally observed is much stronger than that one for small clusters and is sharply growing with radius enhancement . in order to explain this phenomenon observed@xcite in nanospheres of au and confirmed by more precise measurements for au and ag nanospheres reported in the present paper",
    ", we have included damping of plasmon oscillations via irradiation effects , which seem to dominate plasmon energy losses at larger scale of radii and cause strong red - shift of the resonance .",
    "we performed measurements of light extinction by nanospheres ( in water colloidal solution ) of au with radii from 10 nm to 75 nm and ag from 10 nm to 40 nm .",
    "the resulting data reveal a strong shift of resonance towards higher wave - lengths with radius growth .",
    "radiation losses , which , as we suppose , are responsible for radius dependent red - shift of resonance frequency , can be described in terms of lorentz friction@xcite , and calculated also independently in poyting vector terms in a far - field zone of plasmon radiation .",
    "damping of plasmons is caused also additionally by electron scattering processes and we verify that this channel is not important for @xmath10 nm ( @xmath11nanosphere radius ) when radiation losses are much stronger .",
    "the shift of the resonance frequency of dipole - type surface plasmons resulting due to damping phenomena is compared with the experimental data for various nanosphere radii .",
    "emerging of the first mode of volume plasmons is experimentally observed for @xmath12 nm for au and @xmath13 nm for ag , due to breaking the dipole approximation at this range of radius , in agreement with the presented theory predictions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the first paragraph ,",
    "the rpa theory@xcite is generalized for the confined system of spherical shape . in the second one ,",
    "the equations for volume and surface plasmons are solved ( with particularities of calculus in the appendix ) .",
    "the third paragraph contains a description of the lorentz friction for surface plasmons oscillations of the dipole - type . in the fourth one , an analysis of the radiation losses is presented using the poyting vector of plasmon radiation in far - field region , which supports the previous lorentz friction estimation .",
    "the following paragraph comprises the summarizing of whole e - m response of metallic nanosphere system .",
    "the last paragraph presents a comparison of the theoretical predictions with experimental data of e - m response features of the colloidal water solutions with nanospheres of au and ag with several radii of metallic nano - components .",
