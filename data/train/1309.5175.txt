    "finding the minimizer of action functionals is a fundamental problem that appears in a variety of areas in mathematics and science .",
    "for example , it arises in the context of large deviation theory ( ldt ) , where probabilities and expectations over the solutions of stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) can be estimated in the small noise limit via minimization of the freidlin - wentzell action @xcite .",
    "this has led to the development of numerical tools specifically designed to tackle this task : the string method ( for gradient fields ) @xcite , the minimum action method @xcite , the adaptive minimum action method ( amam ) @xcite and the geometric minimum action method ( gmam ) @xcite are a few examples of techniques to calculate the minimizer of the freidlin - wentzell action , also called instanton .",
    "one difficulty one is faced in these calculations is that the speed of the instanton can be very inhomogeneous : for example it can vanish at critical locations making its total duration infinite . in these situations ,",
    "it is computationally advantageous to replace the time - parametrization of the instanton by some other , geometrically motivated parametrizations , such as e.g. arclength parametrization .",
    "this strategy is a the core of the string method as well as amam and gmam .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to revisit these methods and propose alternative ways to calculate instantons by focusing on the hamiltonian counterpart of the euler - lagrange equation of gmam .    to be specific",
    ", we will consider a system of sdes in @xmath1 with a drift vector  @xmath2 and a diffusion matrix @xmath3 weighted by a small parameter @xmath4 characterizing the strength of the noise : @xmath5 for simplicity , we will assume that the diffusion matrix @xmath6 is constant ( but not necessarily diagonal )  the generalization of the ideas below to non - constant @xmath6 is straightforward .",
    "from the theory of large deviations  @xcite it is known that in the limit as  @xmath7 , the solutions to   that contribute most to the probability of an event or the value of an expectation are likely to be close to the minimizer of the freidlin - wentzell action functional @xmath8 subject to appropriate boundary conditions . this action functional",
    "is given by @xmath9 with the lagrangian @xmath10 here @xmath11 denotes the euclidean scalar product between the vectors @xmath12 and @xmath13 and we introduced the norm induced by @xmath6 , @xmath14 ",
    "if @xmath6 is the identity , this is simply the euclidean length .",
    "the instanton , i.e. the path that minimizes the action ( [ eq : freidlin - wentzell_action ] ) , can be found by solving the corresponding euler - lagrange equations @xmath15 with the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "thus , in the context of large deviation theory the estimation of probabilities or expectations can be reduced to the solution of the deterministic system  .",
    "the question then becomes how to do this efficiently , for example in situations where one is searching for solutions to   with one end - point fixed at a stable critical point of @xmath16  this case is relevant e.g. for the estimation of expectations with respect to the stationary distribution of  .",
    "this is the main topic of this paper , which is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : hamilton ] we derive the arclength parametrized hamilton s equations that are equivalent to  .",
    "we also show how these equations can be used to estimate the stationary probability distribution of the sde   via calculation of the quasipotential from ldt ( section  [ sec : interp ] ) , as well as expectations with respect to this distribution ( section  [ sec : expect ] ) .",
    "finally we give a few special solutions of these equations ( section  [ sec : special ] ) . in section  [ sec : algo ] we propose a simple and efficient algorithm for the numerical integration of the arclength parametrized hamilton s equations .",
    "this algorithm is then tested on several illustrative examples : a finite dimensional ornstein - uhlenbeck process that is amenable to analytical solution ( section  [ sec : ou ] ) , the @xmath0-model ( section  [ sec : phi4 ] ) and the randomly forced burgers equation ( section  [ sec : burgers ] ) .",
    "some concluding remarks are given in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "instead of solving ( [ eq : euler - lagrange_original ] ) , we can also compute the instanton in the corresponding hamiltonian framework .",
    "the hamiltonian  @xmath17 is the legendre transform of the lagrangian  @xmath18 , @xmath19 and the hamilton s equations for the instanton are @xmath20 as mentioned before , the main idea of gmam is that , in a wide range of situations , the instanton can be computed much more efficiently by using a parametrization that is different than the time  @xmath21 .",
    "let us consider a reparametrization of the form @xmath22 and assume that @xmath23 . by chain rule",
    ", we have then @xmath24 and we can write @xmath25 one possibility to choose the parametrization is to require that @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a suitable norm and @xmath28 is a constant giving the length of @xmath12 in this norm .",
    "this fixes the value of the function @xmath29 in  , which can be thought of as a lagrange multiplier introduced to enforce the constraint  @xmath26 .",
    "once @xmath29 is known , @xmath30 and its inverse @xmath31 can then be obtained from the last equation in  .",
    "it is often natural to use the norm induced by the correlation matrix @xmath6 , hence to define @xmath32 . for simplicity",
    ", we call this _ arclength parametrization _ even if @xmath6 is not the identity . note",
    "that , in principle , norm ( and parametrization ) can be chosen freely and , indeed , other choices are possible . in the present work , however , we concentrate on arclength parametrization in contrast to the original time parametrization . details of the implication of other parametrizations ( and norms ) will be studied elsewhere .    for diffusion - driven systems ,",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath33 and read explicitly @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the tensor with entries @xmath36 .",
    "correspondingly the first two equations in become @xmath37 in this case , the parametrization by arclength @xmath38 directly leads to @xmath39 and we can write   as @xmath40 the norm appearing in the denominator can be expressed as @xmath41 where we used the property that since the hamiltonian @xmath17 does not depend explicitly on time , energy is conserved and the points on the graph @xmath42 need to satisfy the constraint @xmath43 everywhere .",
    "this leads to yet another equivalent form of  : @xmath44 these equations are valid in particular in the case when @xmath45 , which , as we will see in sections  [ sec : interp ] and  [ sec : expect ] is the relevant one to compute probabilities and expectations with respect to the stationary distribution of  . in the sequel , we will focus on this case , that is , we will study @xmath46 where we dropped the bar to simplify notations - we will stick to this convention in the sequel .",
    "note that these equations seem singular at the critical points where @xmath47 .",
    "this is not the case , however , as @xmath48 at these points , too .",
    "but it will complicate the numerical integration of ( [ eq : gmam_c ] ) since , typically , minimizing paths start from and may go through critical points - this issue will be dealt with in section  [ sec : algo ] . also note that the constant @xmath49 giving the length of the path is , usually , not known _ a  priori_. finally , note that if @xmath6 were not constant , an additional term @xmath50 should be added to the equation for @xmath51-component of @xmath52 .",
    "a key quantity in freidlin - wentzell theory is the quasipotential , defined as @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are two arbitrary points in @xmath56 and the infimum over @xmath12 is taken over all the paths that satisfy @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "the quasipotential permits to estimate various long - time properties of   in the limit as @xmath59 . for example",
    ", if @xmath60 is the unique stable fixpoint of @xmath16 , and under suitable conditions such that the solutions to   are ergodic with respect to the stationary probability density function @xmath61 , then @xmath62 where @xmath63 indicates that the ratio of the logarithms of both sides tends to 1 as @xmath59 . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the quasipotential   can be represented equivalently as @xmath64 where the infimum is taken over the paths that satisfy @xmath57 , @xmath65 and we introduced the geometric action @xmath66 this quantity bears his name from the property that it is left invariant by any reparametrization of the path .",
    "we show now by explicit calculation that arclength parametrized hamilton s equations are equivalent to the euler - lagrange equations associated with ( [ eq : gmam_action ] ) .",
    "these euler - lagrange equations are given by @xmath67 which we can write in a more explicit form as @xmath68 let @xmath69 then ( [ eq : euler_lagrange_1 ] ) can be written as @xmath70 if we solve ( [ eq : definition_of_p ] ) in @xmath71 , and use this expression in ( [ eq : equation_for_p ] ) , the resulting system of equations is exactly  .",
    "assume again that @xmath16 has a single stable fixpoint at @xmath72 and suppose that we want to estimate the following expectation with respect to the stationary density of the process .",
    "@xmath73 where @xmath74 is some function .",
    "then as @xmath59 @xmath75\\right),\\ ] ] where the infimum is taken over all paths such that @xmath76 .",
    "it is easy to see that the minimizer of this variational problem solves   with the boundary conditions @xmath77 note that these boundary conditions differ from the boundary conditions that are commonly used in applications of the original gmam . in those applications , _ two points _",
    ", e.g. two stable fixpoints @xmath60 and @xmath54 are prescribed .",
    "in contrast , when computing expectations as shown above , one of these boundary conditions is replaced by @xmath78 .",
    "it is possible to adapt gmam to handle such boundary conditions , for example by making the end point @xmath79 variable .",
    "however , as shown in section  [ sec : algo ] , working with   offers a much simpler way to handle boundary conditions of the type  .      if @xmath48 , then ( [ eq : gmam_c ] ) reduces to @xmath80 meaning that @xmath81 and point in the same direction .",
    "this solution corresponds to a reparametrized version of a deterministic trajectory , which is the solution of @xmath16 .",
    "another @xmath52 that solves @xmath82 with @xmath17 given by   is @xmath83 , for which the equation for @xmath12 ( [ eq : gmam_c ] ) reduces to @xmath84 meaning that @xmath81 and points in the opposite direction .",
    "this special solution , however , is not always consistent with the second equation in ( [ eq : gmam_c ] ) .",
    "indeed , differentiating @xmath85 gives @xmath86 where we used ( [ eq : xprime_antiparallel_b ] ) to get the second equality .",
    "this equation is consistent with the second equation in ( [ eq : gmam_c ] ) _ iff _",
    "@xmath87 , i.e. _ iff _ the drift term is gradient , @xmath88 for some potential @xmath89 .",
    "thus , solutions of ( [ eq : gmam_c ] ) that follow deterministic paths in reverse can only be observed in gradient systems .",
    "another class of systems for which we can find special solutions of   that are not   are those for which  @xcite @xmath90 where @xmath91 is such that @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "it can easily be checked that in this case the solutions to are ergodic with respect to the following stationary probability density @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a normalization factor . in that case a special class of solutions to   are those such that @xmath96 and @xmath12 satisfies @xmath97 as can be checked by direct substitution .",
    "using the arclength parametrized hamilton s equations ( [ eq : gmam_c ] ) gives us a direct and numerically efficient iterative method to find the instanton that fits the boundary conditions ( [ eq : boundary_x_p ] ) : assume that we are given the @xmath51-th iteration @xmath98 together with an approximation @xmath99 of the path length as approximation to the solution of ( [ eq : gmam_c ] ) with the boundary conditions ( [ eq : boundary_x_p ] ) . to compute the next iteration @xmath100 and @xmath101 we proceed in the following way :    1 .",
    "use the known approximate solution @xmath102 and @xmath99 , together with the known final condition @xmath103 , to solve the equation for @xmath52 backwards in the arclength - parameter @xmath104 to obtain the next iteration @xmath105 .",
    "2 .   use this computed approximate solution @xmath106 and @xmath99 , together with the initial condition @xmath76 , in the equation for @xmath12 to obtain the next iteration @xmath107 .",
    "3 .   compute the length of @xmath107 to obtain the next iteration of  @xmath101 .",
    "if this iteration scheme converges to a fixpoint for @xmath12 and @xmath52 , then the constraint @xmath108 will be automatically satisfied by this fixpoint .",
    "it may not be satisfied during the iterations , however , in which case in step 3 it may be useful to also reparametrize @xmath100 to enforce the constraint @xmath109 . at convergence ,",
    "the solution will also satisfy @xmath82 , since the first equation in   implies that @xmath110 and hence @xmath111 . a similar method ( with a parametrization using an exponentially scaled time )",
    "was suggested by chernykh and stepanov @xcite for the computation of instantons in stochastic burgers equation .",
    "we will discuss this example in more detail in section [ sec : applications ] .",
    "it is worth stressing that the implementation of the method is extremely simple : the solution of ( [ eq : gmam_c ] ) requires only forward ( or backward ) propagation of the initial ( or final ) value , hence existing codes can be easily adapted to be used in this new method .",
    "in contrast , gmam usually requires the design of entirely new code .",
    "the locality in memory of the method presented here is particularly well - suited for parallelization : for large - scale problems , it was successfully implemented in a massively parallel setup , using graphics processing units ( gpus ) to speed up the computation ( this will be presented elsewhere ) .",
    "in contrast , global minimization techniques such as newton or quasi - newton methods are more difficult to implement in such a setting .",
    "these aspects additionally simplify the scaling to a large number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the largest computations for stochastic partial differential equations presented here , with @xmath112 grid - points in space and @xmath113 in time take less than @xmath114 minutes in matlab ( on an intel xeon e5 - 1620 with 3.60ghz ) to successfully converge to the minimizer .",
    "let us now present several examples and applications of the new method . in these examples , we focus on the exit from a stable fixed point and apply the iterative method described section  [ sec : algo ] in two ways : first , using hamilton s equations in the original time - parametrization given by ( [ eq : hamilton_time_parametrization ] ) : @xmath115 and second using the arclength parametrized hamilton s equations  : @xmath116 in all cases , we consider the escape from a stable fixpoint @xmath60 that can be used as initial condition for @xmath12 in the above equations and we designate a final condition for  @xmath52 either by fixing it or through the second boundary condition in   for some specific  @xmath117 .",
    "note that , in the time - parametrized case , since @xmath60 is a stable fixpoint , it takes infinite time to escape it .",
    "this makes the iteration numerically difficult as , in practice , one needs to choose a @xmath118 and then decrease it towards @xmath119 until convergence of the computed minimum of the action .",
    "this problem does not occur when one works with arclength - parametrization , which is an immediate numerical advantage of this method .      as a first example , consider a linear ornstein - uhlenbeck model for which the drift @xmath120 is of the form @xmath121 with @xmath122 and the matrix @xmath123 not necessarily normal . in this case",
    ", a lot of analytical information about the minimizer can be obtained in the following way  @xcite : let @xmath28 be the solution of @xmath124 with @xmath6 being the diffusion tensor from above .",
    "then @xmath125 is the covariance of the equilibrium distribution for the sde , which is zero - mean gaussian and exists as long as @xmath126 is a stable fixpoint of @xmath127 .",
    "the path of maximum likelihood of escape from @xmath128 is the time - reversed of the solution to @xmath129 this result is consistent with the fact that the time - reversed form of the sde   with @xmath130 is @xmath131 and it corresponds to picking @xmath132 as solution to @xmath82 .",
    "it can be checked that , if we insert   in the first equation in  , this equation reduces to , and that the second equation in   is also satisfied . since we can compute the minimizer analytically",
    ", this model is a good start to compare the two methods ( hamilton s equations with time - parametrization vs hamilton s equations with arclength - parametrization ) and to study convergence . as a concrete example , we chose @xmath133 and @xmath134 , @xmath135 as a test case . note that , in this case , @xmath123 is normal and , therefore , the analytical solution is even simpler : the minimizing path is the time - reversed of the trajectory that spirals into the fixpoint at the origin and is given by @xmath136 for this system we implemented the algorithm described in section  [ sec : algo ] to solve both the equations of motion of the original hamiltonian and of the geometric parametrization .",
    "propagation of the initial conditions is realized with a simple first order explicit euler scheme .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : convergence ] , with identical resolution the proposed method is closer to the analytical solution by a factor @xmath137 ( for a given accuracy , the proposed method needs roughly a factor 10 grid - points less ) . due to the choice of the integration scheme ,",
    "both methods converge with first order .",
    "the difference to the analytical solution is measured by comparing the endpoints of the paths , @xmath138 ( due to different parametrizations , differences between other points than the endpoint are harder to define and calculate ) .    the action density over the curve parameter is concentrated on times close to @xmath139 for the time parametrization , while it gets stretched out to cover a significant part of the temporal domain in the geometric case ( see figure  [ fig : action ] ) . this behavior is desired , because it offers more grid points in the regions with critical dynamics .     to the analytical solution for the first test problem . due to the choice of the time integration scheme ,",

    "<S> its simplicity and computational efficiency are illustrated here using several examples : a finite - dimensional stochastic dynamical system ( an ornstein - uhlenbeck model ) and two models based on stochastic partial differential equations : the @xmath0-model and the stochastically driven burgers equation . </S>"
