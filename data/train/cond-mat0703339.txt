    "the influence of quantum impurities embedded into a system of conducting electrons on the properties of the host have long been the subject of research activities in condensed matter physics .",
    "theoretically , local scatterers with internal degrees of freedom in a lattice system can be described by the anderson and kondo models @xcite . in recent years",
    "these models have found new applications beyond their original realm of magnetic impurities in a metallic system : electron transport through quantum dots and wires or molecules in contact to a metallic surface provide realizations of the kondo effect which allows for experimental control of the relevant parameters . as a consequence , in particular the behaviour of a kondo impurity embedded into a luttinger liquid has been investigated in great detail using field theoretical methods @xcite . with these methods",
    "the critical behaviour of such systems can be classified .",
    "still for the full picture and in particular for a better understanding of the emergence of this behaviour within a microscopic realization exact solutions of integrable lattice models provide useful insights .    following the bethe ansatz solution of the kondo hamiltonian @xcite",
    "several one - dimensional models dealing with impurities have been constructed within the framework of the quantum inverse scattering method , e.g.  the heisenberg chain with an magnetic impurity @xcite or integrable inhomogeneities in a @xmath0@xmath1 chain @xcite . within this approach the hybridization of the local level with the host system",
    "can be varied without spoiling integrability while the inhomogeneity s degrees of freedom have to be compatible with the symmetry of the host system .",
    "additional control of the impurity is possible by combining it with a physical boundary @xcite . here",
    "the strength of a scalar boundary potential appears as an additional parameter and certain restrictions on the spectrum of the local scatterer can be relaxed .",
    "this allows for the construction of purely magnetic ( kondo ) impurities in one - dimensional lattice models of correlated itinerant electrons @xcite . within sklyanin",
    "s reflection algebra @xcite these new impurity models arise as a consequence of a synchronization of the boundary potential to the parameters of the impurity where different sectors in the impurity s internal hilbert space decouple @xcite allowing to project out some of the local configurations  similar as in the schrieffer - wolff transformation from the anderson to the kondo model .",
    "this projection ( performed on the level of the hamiltonian ) has a direct influence on the determination of the many - particle spectrum by means of the algebraic bethe ansatz : to capture the influence of the impurity on the physical properties it has to be ensured that the correct sector of the impurity s state space is kept .",
    "this can be achieved by working directly with the projected system @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it should be possible to extract the levels from the full impurity spectrum provided that a criterion can be formulated which allows to select states from a given sector .    in this paper",
    "we show that this selection is indeed possible based on the presence or absence of special solutions  identified with bound states in the spectrum  to the bethe equations which are known to exist in either the presence of a sufficiently strong boundary field or that of an impurity . we begin with a brief review of the construction of integrable lattice models with boundaries . for a particular inhomogeneity in the supersymmetric @xmath0@xmath1 model already considered in @xcite",
    "we analyze the spectrum of impurity and boundary bound states and then show how different sets of bethe ansatz equations for a kondo spin-@xmath2 emerge from the impurity system when these bound states are populated .",
    "to introduce our notations we start with a brief review of the theory of integrable models with boundaries . in the framework of the quantum inverse scattering method ( qism ) @xcite the construction of integrable hamiltonians",
    "is based on vertex models obtained by combining @xmath3-operators which satisfy the intertwining relation @xmath4 models which are constructed in this approach are classified by a particular choice of the @xmath5-matrix entering ( [ ir ] ) which in turn has to solve the quantum yang - baxter equation ( ybe ) : @xmath6 ( superscripts denote the spaces in the tensor product @xmath7 in which @xmath8 acts nontrivially )",

    "for example , choosing @xmath13 and identifying @xmath14 with the quantum space corresponding to site @xmath15 of a one - dimensional lattice a family of commuting operators on the space @xmath16 is given by the transfer matrix ( products of the @xmath12-operators and the trace are taken in the ` auxiliary ' space @xmath17 ) @xmath18 the fundamental rational models with nearest neighbour interaction obtained within this approach are , among others , the spin @xmath19 heisenberg chain and the one - dimensional supersymmetric @xmath0@xmath1 model with periodic boundary conditions .",

    "in addition the coupling of the imhomogeneity site to the rest of the lattice can be varied by a shift of the argument , i.e.  @xmath26 which is consistent with relation ( [ ir ] ) .",

    "@xcite and [ app : gl21 ] ) .",
    "this particluar representation has already been used in constructing an integrable model of a doped spin @xmath2 heisenberg chain @xcite . in terms of the generators of @xmath25",
    "the impurity @xmath12-operator is given by @xcite @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the quadratic casimir ( [ cas2 ] ) of @xmath25 on the tensor product @xmath30 ( the auxiliary space @xmath17 carries the three - dimensional fundamental representation @xmath31_+$ ] of @xmath25 ) .",
    "boundary conditions different from periodic ones can be treated within the qism by extending the algebra defined by the intertwining relations through so - called reflection equations ( re ) @xcite .",
