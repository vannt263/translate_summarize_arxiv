    "the original proposal by skyrme of the early sixties foresaw that baryons could be described as classical topological solitons of a specific non - linear chirally symmetric lagrangean in terms of meson fields with non - trivial boundary conditions  @xcite . within the accepted qcd framework",
    "the large-@xmath0 analysis under the assumption of confinement  @xcite supports many aspects of this view .",
    "moreover , the identification of the topological winding number as the conserved baryon number of quarks from the occupied dirac sea in the background of large and spatially extended pion fields  @xcite suggested the underlying necessary fermionic nature of the soliton at least for odd @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the form of the lagrangean remains unspecified besides the requirement of chiral symmetry , leaving much freedom on the assumed meson - field dynamics needed for practical computations of low - energy baryonic properties  @xcite , usually organized in terms of a finite number of bosons of increasing mass .",
    "one appealing feature of the skyrme model ( for reviews see e.g. @xcite ) is that confinement appears to be explicitly incorporated , since the baryon number topology of the meson fields can not be changed with a finite amount of energy and the soliton is absolutely stable against decay into free quarks .",
    "this has also made possible the study of excited baryons ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein )",
    ". however , when the partonic content of the baryon is analyzed in deep inelastic scattering , in the skyrme model the callan - gross relation is violated , hence the partons turn out not to be spin one - half objects  @xcite . therefore , making credible non - perturbative estimates of high energy properties is out of reach of the standard skyrme model .",
    "this also suggests that the relevant degrees of freedom should explicitly include constituent quarks chirally coupled to mesons  @xcite motivating the use of chiral quark models with quarks and to search for solitonic solutions to describe baryons .",
    "the approach is very much in the spirit of the skyrme model but with the important feature that the partonic interpretation corresponds to spin one - half constituents , despite the subtleties of the regularization  @xcite .",
    "the considerable effort exerted to describe low - lying baryons as solitons of effective chiral quark models has been described in detail in the reviews @xcite .",
    "the chiral quark models that arise naturally in several approaches to low - energy quark dynamics , such as the instanton - liquid model @xcite or the schwinger - dyson resummation of rainbow diagrams @xcite , are _ nonlocal _ , _ i.e. _ the quark mass function depends on the quark virtuality . for the derivations and applications of these models",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "a major success was the finding of baryon hedgehog solitons in nonlocal models @xcite , which turn out to be stable also in the linear version of the model .",
    "moreover , the nonlocal models have nice features as compared to the local variants , in particular they use a uniform regularization of both the normal and abnormal parity processes , thus reproducing properly the anomalies in the presence of regularization .",
    "in addition , the theory is made finite to all orders of perturbation theory .",
    "the price to pay for the non - locality is a complicated nature of interaction vertices with currents , where the gauge invariance imposes non - local contributions .",
    "their presence leads to technical complications in the treatment of non - local models .",
    "a relevant issue for chiral quark solitons is related to the confinement and stability of the mean field solution .",
    "the chiral quark soliton model builds baryons as bound states of valence constituent quarks in non - trivial meson fields .",
    "indeed , such a model interpolates between the non - relativistic quark model and the skyrme model in the limit of small solitons and large solitons , respectively  @xcite . as a matter of fact , from the view point of the chiral quark model , the apparent confinement in the skyrme model",
    "is reinterpreted as a strong binding effect , and indeed deeply bound states are not sensitive to the confinement properties of the interaction .",
    "nevertheless , it is notorious that depending on the details , the mean field soliton may in fact decay into three free constituent quarks .",
    "moreover , in local models for small enough solitons the valence state becomes an unbound free quark at rest .",
    "actually , to our knowledge there is no satisfactory calculation of excited baryon states in the chiral quark soliton model precisely because of the lack of confinement  @xcite .",
    "these features happen for realistic parameter values and despite the alleged compatibility of the chiral quark model with the large-@xmath0 limit . as already mentioned the soliton description of baryons in the large-@xmath0 limit",
    "is based on the assumption of confinement .",
    "let us define the scope of the present work .",
    "after the many years , the issue of color confinement remains a crucial and intriguing subject for which no obvious solution exists yet .",
    "in particular , its realization implies two relevant consequences . in the first place",
    ", there exists a spectrum of color singlet excited states .",
    "secondly , quarks can not become on shell and hence quark propagators merely can not have poles on the real axis .",
    "this restrained meaning of confinement is often called _ analytic confinement _ in the literature and in that sense is adopted in the present work .",
    "we hasten to emphasize that although our work obviously _ does not _",
    "suggest how the problem of color confinement might be resolved , we manage to set up a framework where the calculation of color singlet states such as excited baryons becomes possible as a matter of principle within a chiral quark soliton approach .    in this paper",
    "we show how a recently proposed version of the chiral quark model , the spectral quark model ( sqm )  @xcite ( see also @xcite for the original insights on the spectral problem ) , not only allows for solitonic solutions but due to its unconventional and indeed remarkable analytic properties yields a valence eigenvalue which never becomes unbound . thus the soliton is absolutely stable .",
    "the model is based on a generalized lehmann representation where the spectral function is generically complex , involving a continuous superposition of complex masses .",
    "the subject of defining a well founded quantum field theory of fixed complex masses is an old story @xcite .",
    "our approach differs from these works , since our complex mass is an integration variable so that many standard objections are sidestepped by choosing an appropriate integration contour . in practical terms",
    "the spectral function acts as a finite regulator fulfilling suitable spectral conditions but with many desirable properties , in particular the simple implementation of chiral symmetry and gauge invariance .",
    "one of its outstanding features is the uniform treatment of normal and abnormal parity processes ensuring both finiteness of the action and a simultaneous implementation of the correctly normalized wess - zumino - witten term .",
    "this uniform treatment of regularization has some impact on soliton calculations even in the su(2 ) case ( where the wess - zumino - witten term vanishes ) since the valence and sea contributions to the soliton energy are indeed related to the abnormal and normal parity separation of the effective action , respectively .",
    "the basics of sqm are described in detail in @xcite and the reader is referred there for the description of the method and numerous applications to the pion phenomenology .",
    "the sqm approach bares similarities to nonlocal models , however the construction of interaction vertices with currents is very simple in sqm , as opposed to almost prohibitive complications of the nonlocal approach .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold : firstly , we show that absolutely stable baryon solitons in sqm exist and discuss their properties . secondly and more generally",
    ", we study an instance of an involved complex - mass system , and show how to treat valence states . despite the complexity",
    ", the resulting prescription turns out to be very simple and easy to implement in practical calculations .",
    "it amounts to locating the saddles of the valence eigenvalue , @xmath1 , as a function of the complex mass @xmath2 , based on the condition @xmath3    the outline of our paper is as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec : cons - sqm ] we provide an operational justification of the need of some uniform regularization for the full action without an explicit separation between normal and abnormal parity contributions .",
    "certain _ a priori _ field - theoretic consistency conditions are discussed .",
    "sqm is shown to fulfill the _ one - body _ consistency condition in contrast to previous local versions of chiral quark models .",
    "we also discuss in some detail the analytic structure of the meson correlators , showing that despite analytically - confined quarks they possess cuts at large values of @xmath4 , as requested by ( asymptotic ) quark unitarity .",
    "however , the meromorphic structure expected from general large @xmath0 considerations is violated .",
    "this point is analyzed in the light of a large-@xmath0 regge model .",
    "next , we pass to the analysis of solitons .",
    "first , we discuss the connection between the baryon and topological currents in the limit of large solitons , which holds in the presence of the spectral regularization .",
    "following the standard field - theoretic approach the construction of the baryon state is pursued in sect .",
    "[ sec : formal ]",
    ". the unconventional appearance of complex - masses requires a demanding mathematical treatment of both the valence and sea contributions .",
    "nevertheless , ready - to - use formulas for the total soliton mass are derived and analyzed for several soliton profiles showing the existence of chiral solitons with baryon number one .",
    "an alternative derivation is provided in appendix  [ sec : spec - first ] based on computing the spectral integral exactly . dealing with complex mass dirac operators both for bound states and continuum states is involved and some of the features may be studied in a somewhat comprehensive toy model in appendix  [ sec : toy ] .",
    "the techniques are close to the more familiar complex potentials in non - relativistic quantum mechanics which are reviewed for completeness in appendix  [ qm ] . in appendix  [ exlin ]",
    "we show that a linear extension of sqm leads to instability of the vacuum , hence sqm can only be constructed in the originally proposed nonlinear realization . in sect .",
    "[ sec : self ] we look for self - consistent hedgehog solutions and determine their properties both in the chiral limit as well as for finite pion masses . finally , in sect .  [ sec : concl ] we come to the conclusions .",
    "we begin with some basic expressions of the general field - theoretic treatment of chiral quark models , which are the groundwork for our treatment of solitons and the method of including valence states in sqm discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : formal ] . in this section",
    "we highlight an important consistency condition which was not fulfilled in the hitherto extensively used chiral quark soliton models based on local interactions .",
    "remarkably , this condition happens to be satisfied in sqm .",
    "the analytic properties of the quark propagator and in particular the lack of poles are reviewed .",
    "we also analyze some important aspects of the meson sector , and in particular the analytic structure of two - point correlators in the complex @xmath4-plane .",
    "finally , we show how the correct topological current arises in the presence of regularization .",
    "the vacuum - to - vacuum transition amplitude in the presence of _ external _ bosonic @xmath5 and fermionic @xmath6 fields of a chiral quark model lagrangian can be written in the path - integral form as @xmath7 & = & \\langle 0 | { \\rm t } \\exp \\bigl\\ { i \\int d^4 x \\big[\\bar q   j q + \\bar \\eta q + \\bar q \\eta \\big ] \\big\\ } |0 \\rangle , \\label{eq : z } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the compact notation @xmath8 has been introduced .",
    "the symbols @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 denote the external scalar , pseudoscalar , vector , and axial flavor sources , respectively , given in terms of the generators of the flavor @xmath13 group , @xmath14 with @xmath15 representing the gell - mann matrices .",
    "any physical matrix element can be computed by functional differentiation with respect to the external sources .",
    "let us consider the calculation of a bilinear quark operator , such as , _",
    "e.g. _ , the quark condensate ( for a single flavor ) @xmath16 .",
    "we can think of two possible ways of making such a computation , namely via coupling of an external scalar source @xmath17 ( a mass term ) and differentiating with respect to @xmath17 , or by calculating the second functional derivative with respect to the grassmann external sources @xmath18 and @xmath19 taken at the same spatial point . the consistency of the calculation requires the following trivial identity for the generating functional : @xmath20 where @xmath21 means all external sources set to zero .",
    "this requirement can be generalized to any quark bilinear with any bosonic quantum numbers and thus we call it the _ one - body consistency condition_. in the traditional treatment of local chiral quark models the l.h.s . of",
    "the above formula corresponds to a closed quark line and is divergent , calling for regularization , whereas for @xmath22 the r.h.s .",
    "is finite and corresponds to an open quark line , thus no regularization is demanded .",
    "this poses a consistency problem which actually becomes crucial in the analysis of high - energy processes and introduces an ambiguity in the partonic interpretation as well as conflicts with gauge invariance and energy - momentum conservation ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite for a further discussion on these subtle but relevant issues ) .",
    "obviously , the previous argument could equally be applied to sources with any quantum numbers suggesting that any _ consistent _ regularization should be applied to the full action . as already mentioned in the introduction , in the traditional approach to local models",
    "the treatment of singularities requires first to separate the normal and abnormal parity contributions and to regularize only the normal parity piece . in the euclidean space this separation corresponds to the real and imaginary parts of the action .    in the next section",
    "we show that sqm fulfills the one - body consistency condition .",
    "more generally , one might want to extend the condition ( [ eq : cons - qq ] ) to any number of quark bilinears contracted to bosonic quantum numbers , namely the @xmath23body consistency condition @xmath24 where the l.h.s .",
    "is evaluated after functional derivatives with respect to bosonic sources and the r.h.s . with respect to fermionic sources respectively . here",
    "@xmath25 are general spin - flavor matrices . we have found that this is not possible in the sqm scheme ( see the discussion in sect .",

    "chiral and electromagnetic gauge invariance can be taken care of through the use of the gauge technique of delbourgo and west  @xcite , which provide particular solutions to chiral ward - takahashi identities , or through the use the standard effective action approach , applied in this paper . as a result",

    "the one - body consistency condition is fulfilled _",
    "precisely _ because we use the same spectral function @xmath42 for both .",
    "we have refrained on purpose from writing a lagrangean in terms of quarks explicitly since anyhow chiral quark models are defined in conjunction with the regularization and the approximation used . in our case",
    "we work in the leading order of the large-@xmath0 expansion , which amounts to a saddle point approximation in the bosonic @xmath43-fields and use the spectral regularization which is most explicitly displayed in terms of the generating functional presented above .",

    "moreover , the close resemblance of the valence contribution to the energy around the minimum suggests that the phenomenology and results of previous calculations within constituent chiral quark models with a constant mass are reproduced , at least for the low - lying baryon states .",
