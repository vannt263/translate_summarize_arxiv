    "the coefficient functions @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 relate to the form factors of weak currents directly ( see below ) .",
    "to evaluate the exclusive semileptonic differential decay rates of @xmath24 meson , one needs to calculate the hadron matrix element of the weak current @xmath21 sandwiched by the @xmath24 meson state as the initial state and a single - hadron state of the concerned final state , i.e. , @xmath45 with @xmath25 being a given suitable meson .",
    "in fact , the hadron matrix elements of weak currents can be generally expressed in terms of the momenta @xmath22 and @xmath23 of the mesons in initial state and final state respectivelly , as well as their coefficients .",

    "but with improvements @xcite , i.e. , the used wave functions are obtained by solving the relevant instantaneous bs equation with the improved approach @xcite . although the improved approach is used to calculate the hadron matrix elements of weak currents , the form factors are still written as overlap integrals of the relevant wave functions for the bound states ( mesons ) . to show the general feature of the improved approach",

    "moreover , here we temperately constrain ourselves to consider the cases that @xmath25 is a @xmath47-wave meson only .",

    "if @xmath25 is a @xmath54 state , of the weak current the axial vector matrix element vanishes , and the vector current matrix element can be written as : @xmath55    \\2 . if @xmath25 is a @xmath56 state , of the weak current the axial vector matrix element",

    "the components of the meson @xmath7 are @xmath90 and @xmath91 quarks , and it happens that the contributions from each of them to the total decay rate are comparable in magnitude .",

    "we also should point out that since only the experimental related ratio @xmath104 is available now , and the two involved decay modes in the ratio are two - body decays , so the test of the approaches are limited .",

    "<S> @xmath7 meson carries two heavy flavor quantum numbers explicitly , and it decays only via weak interactions , although the strong and electromagnetic interactions can affect the decays . as consequences , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7 meson has a comparatively long lifetime and very rich weak decay channels with sizable branching ratios . </S>",
    "<S> being an explicit double heavy flavor meson , its production cross section can be estimated by perturbative qcd quite reliably and one can conclude that only via strong interaction and at hadronic high energy collisions the meson can be produced so numerously that it can be observed experimentally @xcite . therefore , the meson is specially interesting in studying its production and decays both .    </S>",
    "<S> the first successful observation of @xmath7 was achieved through the semileptonic decay channel @xmath8 by cdf collaboration in 1998 from run - i at tevatron . </S>",

    "<S> further gave a more precise mass @xmath11(stat)@xmath125(syst ) mev/@xmath13 obtained through the exclusive non - leptonic decay @xmath14 @xcite , and upgraded their results @xcite . in the meantime d0 collaboration at tevatron also carried out the observations and confirmed cdf results @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> resently , lhcb reported several new observations on @xmath7 decays @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus we may reasonably expect that at lhcb in the near future the @xmath7 data will be largely enhanced and new results are issued in time .    in literatures , </S>",
    "<S> there are many works studying various @xmath7 decays @xcite under different approaches . among the approaches in the market , the one used in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is that when the components in the concerned meson(s ) in initial and final states are heavy quarks , an instantaneous bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation @xcite ( also called salpeter equation @xcite ) with an instantaneous qcd - inspired kernel ( interaction ) is used to depict the meson(s ) and the mandelstam formula @xcite is adopted to compute hadron matrix elements relevant to the concerned decays . </S>",
    "<S> this approach has a comparatively solid foundation because the relativistic ` recoil effects ' in the decays meson and the decay product e.g. charmonium is great , so the recoil in a @xmath7 decay must be relativistic , and the `` recoil effects '' in the decay should be taken into account well . ] may be taken into account better than in potential model and else approaches . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that the bs equation and the mandelstam formula both are established on relativistic quantum field theory , although the bs equation is deduced into an instantaneous one . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , took an extra approximation . </S>",
    "<S> since now a way to solve the instantaneous bs equation without the extra approximation is avaliable @xcite , and a way more properly to treat the relevant transition matrix elements in mandelstam formulation has been explored for years @xcite , so we think that now it is the right time by using the new wave functions obtained by solving the instantaneous bs equation without the extra approximation and the improved formula for the transition matrix elements to estimate the @xmath7 decays theoretically and then to compare the results with the newly experimental data to see how well the new improved approach @xcite works . </S>",
    "<S> considering the progresses in experiments , especially those at lhcb , in this paper we would like to restrict ourselves to focus lights on the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) favored @xmath7 decays : the semileptonic ones @xmath15 and the nonleptonic ones @xmath16 precisely , where @xmath2 represents pseudoscalar ( vector ) charmonium or a @xmath3 bound state .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows . in sec . </S>",
