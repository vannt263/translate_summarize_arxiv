    "@xcite confirm this idea also works for oxygen - rich ( o - rich ) agb stars , which produce silicate dust , but require the dust grains to be mg - rich , being highly transparent in the infrared , and to grow to 0.11 @xmath3 m sizes in order to have the large scattering cross - sections necessary to experience radiation pressure sufficient to push the grains outward to drive the mass outflow .",
    "the mass - loss rate is an important parameter in characterizing the life of a star and also in constructing galaxy evolution models . for agb stars ,",
    "we have been estimating dust mass - loss rates through fitting optical through mid - infrared spectral energy distributions ( seds ; plots of flux versus wavelength ) for stars in the large magellanic cloud @xcite using radiative transfer models of emission from dust shells around stars ( e.g. , see the  grams ",

    ", we give typical values of the rms noise in the channel maps .",
    "the initial data reduction and calibration was done using the software mir .",
    "after calibrating the data in mir , the data were exported to the software miriad @xcite for output of spectra and synthesis of images . in miriad , we used the _ invert _ task to transform visibilities to channel maps .",
    "most maps are 67@xmath167 pixels in size , with the square pixels being @xmath40.6@xmath5 on a side .",
    "next , we applied a hybrid hogbom / clark / steer _ clean _ algorithm .",
    "this was followed by applying the _ restor _ task , which generated a cleaned map for each channel from the _ clean _ task output .",
    "we then used the _ cgdisp _ task to overlay the restored channel contour maps on top of _ spitzer _ glimpse @xcite images of the same regions .",
    "the output cleaned maps were searched for point sources .",
    "the spectrum of each point source was obtained by using the _ imspec _ task to compute the spectrum for an aperture ( a box usually about 3@xmath5 @xmath1 4.8@xmath5 in size ) at the position of the point source .",
    "when a point source was found , the channels where the point source emission was strongest were binned together , and the centroid of the point source in the binned image was determined .",

    "guided by plots of visibility amplitude versus projected baseline length , @xcite remove the shorter baselines from their sma data in order to remove interstellar emission contamination from their data .",

    "the size of the primary beam is indicated in the contour plots as the magenta circle ( or arcs , if the plot is zoomed in ) .",
    "the correction scalar is the inverse of the value of the gaussian at the position of the centroid .",
    "this is the primary beam correction .    in order to know at",
    "which velocity to expect the co j=2 - 1 emission , the radial velocity for a source is needed .",

    "the radial velocity for the other oh / ir star , a29 , was obtained from the oh 1612 mhz maser study by @xcite .",
    "no radial velocity was available for the agb star a27 .",
    "we determined the positional accuracy for our sma data by using the miriad _ imfit _ task to fit a 2-dimensional gaussian to images of the quasars we observed as passband calibrators ( 3c279 , 3c273 , and 3c454.3 ) and computing the positional offset between the best - fit 2-d gaussian and the center of the sma field - of - view .",

    "this can be compared to the positional accuracy determined for point sources detected by the glimpse team using _ spitzer _ of @xmath40.3@xmath5 .",
    "thus , the relative positional accuracy between our sma data and _ spitzer _ glimpse images would be the sum in quadrature of these two accuracies , or about 0.8@xmath5 .",

    "this model assumes unresolved , optically thick emission from the co gas giving rise to the j=21 line .",
    "the center , width , and peak flux of the parabola are allowed to be free parameters .",
    "the best fit , shown in figure 2 , has the parameters f@xmath13 = 0.36 jy , v@xmath14 = -182.3 km  s@xmath6 , and v@xmath16 = 19.1 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "note the good matching between the velocity range of the best - fit model and the red and blue limits of the oh maser emission detected by @xcite .",
    "we then use the formula presented by @xcite to obtain total mass - loss rate from the integrated line flux of the co j=2 - 1 line . to obtain integrated flux in units of k",
    "km  s@xmath6 as required for the @xcite formula , we translated our spectra from flux density to brightness temperature using the planck formula .",
    "we find a total mass - loss rate of 7.9 ( @xmath0 2.2 ) @xmath110@xmath2 for oh359 , assuming a co - to - h@xmath17 abundance ratio of 2@xmath110@xmath18 @xcite and an adopted distance of @xmath48 kpc @xcite .",
    "a caveat , as noted by @xcite and @xcite , is that the @xcite mass - loss rate formula has only been checked to be valid for mass - loss rates between 10@xmath19 and 10@xmath2 .",
    "also , the @xcite mass - loss rate formula applies only for unresolved emission , so a further caveat is that if any signal from our sources falls outside the rectangular regions from which we extracted spectra ( whether due to sidelobes or due to the source intrinsically being extended / resolved ) , then the extracted fluxes will be artificially lowered , and the calculated gas mass - loss rate will be correspondingly lowered .    in assigning errors to the parabola fit parameters , instead of using the standard deviation on a quantity",
    ", we initially used the median absolute deviation ( mad ) , as @xcite used when determining uncertainties on dust mass loss rates . for the parameter in question",
    ", this entails taking the median value of the parameter in the n best - fit models ( i.e. , the models with the n lowest chi - squared values ) , finding the absolute value of the difference between each model s parameter value and the median parameter value , and then finding the median of the set of absolute values of differences . as @xcite note , for normally distributed errors",
    ", this mad uncertainty is somewhat lower than the standard deviation . instead of determining mad from the 100 best models , as @xcite did , we take the 10000 best models , as we explore a grid of @xmath20 10@xmath21 models ( all combinations of 101 values of each of f@xmath13 , v@xmath14 , and v@xmath16 ) to model a given co line , in comparison to the @xmath412000 ( carbon - rich ) or @xmath469000 ( oxygen - rich ) grams models @xcite explored when modeling evolved star seds .",
    "we determined the mad uncertainties on f@xmath13 , v@xmath14 , and v@xmath16 ; however , these uncertainties seemed low .",
    "the oh359 spectrum ( figure 2 ) shows single - channel ( 1 km  s@xmath6 ) scatter , so we assign 1 km  s@xmath6 uncertainty to the radial velocity , v@xmath14 . since the expansion velocity involves measuring the location of both the red and blue ends of the co line , and each such measurement has the same uncertainty , we assign to the expansion velocity , v@xmath16 ( which is a difference in velocities ; i.e. , the red and blue ends of the co line ) , the square root of 2 times the uncertainty assigned to the radial velocity , v@xmath14 .",
    "thus , we assign an uncertainty on the expansion velocity for oh359 of 1.4 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "we use the mad uncertainty for the line strength , f@xmath13 .",
    "we propagate these errors through our calculations of the integrated co line intensity , i@xmath22 , and the gas mass - loss rate , @xmath23 ( see table 2 for all these uncertainties ) .",
    "we also detected a point source at the expected position of a12 ( figure 3 ) , and a point source is detected in an 8@xmath10 _ spitzer _ glimpse image .",
    "we bin the channel maps between velocities of 95 and 117 km  s@xmath6 to determine the centroid of the co emission .",
    "we obtain the spectrum with _ imspec _ using a 3.45@xmath112.01@xmath5 box centered at the centroid of the point source in the velocity - binned image .",
    "we obtain the parameters f@xmath13 = 0.91 jy , v@xmath14 = 105.0 km  s@xmath6 , and v@xmath16 = 14.3 km  s@xmath6 from the best - fitting model ( figure 4 ) . here , the matching between the velocity range of our co model and the oh maser detection by @xcite is not as good as for oh359 .",
    "the oh emission is likely less contaminated by interstellar emission than the co is , so we focus on how the intrinsic co profile of this star might be affected by interstellar co emission . removing short baselines",
    "should preferentially eliminate extended emission structures in the data but may also eliminate emission arising from compact sources .",
    "it is possible there is still some extended emission that has not been eliminated by baseline removal , and it is also possible that emission from the point source has been over - subtracted . for these reasons ,",
    "the co emission seen in figure 4 may not be exactly the total circumstellar co emission from a12 ; in other words , the co emission seen in figure 4 may not be identical to how it would appear if a12 did not have the contaminating interstellar co emission .",
    "for a12 , because the peaks and dips in the noise both outside of the co line and on top of the co line are all about 3 channels wide , we assign uncertainties of 3 km  s@xmath6 to v@xmath14 and the square root of 2 times this , or 4.2 km  s@xmath6 , to v@xmath16 , while retaining the mad uncertainty on f@xmath13 .",
    "again we use the @xcite formula to obtain total mass - loss rate from the integrated line flux of the co j=21 line , and we find a gas mass - loss rate of 5.4 ( @xmath0 2.8 ) @xmath110@xmath2 for a12 , with the same caveats as for oh359 .    additionally , we detected a point source at the expected position of a51 ( figure 5 ) , and a point source is found in an 8@xmath3 m _ spitzer _ glimpse image centered on this star . here ,",

    ", there is a marked discrepancy between the velocity ranges of the co emission model and the oh maser detection by @xcite .",
    "again , it is possible the baseline removal affected the shape of the co line .",
    "though we find v@xmath16 = 6.0 km  s@xmath6 for a51 , lower values of v@xmath16 for o - rich agb stars have been reported in the literature ( see the terminal velocity of 4.2 km  s@xmath6 for v438 oph given by * ? ? ?",

    "however , because of the large discrepancy between the v@xmath16 we determine from co emission and the velocity range between the red and blue peaks of the oh maser emission for this source @xcite , we consider this at best only a tentative detection of co j=21 emission from a51 .",

    "where oh and co emission is produced in agb envelopes , it is conceivable the oh has a higher expansion velocity than the co. again , it is also possible that the difference in expansion velocities determined from oh emission versus co emission is not real , but only an artifact of heavy contamination by interstellar emission that has either been incorrectly removed in data reduction , whether by over- or under - subtraction .",

    "in addition to oh359 , a12 , and a51 , we also observed a number of fields where we expected to find our other targets .",
    "for none of the other targets were compact sources seen in the center of the fields - of - view of the sma maps .",

    "the sma spectrum of this source ( figure 8) shows strong emission at a line center near 96 km  s@xmath6 . a parabolic fit to this line finds f@xmath13 = 2.3 jy , v@xmath14 = 96 km  s@xmath6 , and v@xmath16 = 11 km  s@xmath6 . after constructing an sed using vizier in simbad and fitting a grams o - rich model @xcite to its infrared sed to obtain a dust mass - loss rate , and",

    "therefore , the compact source seen around 180 km  s@xmath6 in the sma data is not likely from an oh / ir or other dusty evolved star .    for a27 , we were not aware of an oh maser detection to guide us in looking for its co emission .",

    "@xcite find that the galactic bulge should , on average , have a slightly lower metallicity than the sun ( [ fe / h ] = 0 dex ) but a slightly higher metallicity than the solar neighborhood ( see figure 9 of * ? ? ?",

    "however , the metallicities for the galactic bulge stars range widely , extending to very low metallicities @xcite , so the lowest metallicity galactic bulge stars may be expected to have gas - to - dust ratios @xmath20 160 .",
    "our four detected stars all have subsolar metallicities ( table 3 ) .    the infrared seds of oh359 , e51 , a12 , and a51 were assembled by collecting their photometry using the vizier tool in simbad .",

    "the dereddened seds for oh359 , e51 , a12 , and a51 are given in figures 13 , 14 , 15 , and 16 , respectively .",
    "we did not fit carbon - rich ( c - rich ) grams models @xcite to these 4 galactic bulge star seds because oh masers have been detected for each of these 4 stars ( for oh359 , a12 , and a51 , see table 1 ; for e51 , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so we conclude they are likely o - rich .",
    "we therefore fit o - rich grams models to the dereddened seds of these stars , after the manner of @xcite . using the measurements of these 4 stars variability ( see table 3 )",
    ", we determined a value of @xmath30 to use in inflating the error bars of all photometry ( again , after the manner of * ? ? ? * ) except for the _ spitzer_-irac photometry from glimpse , which we treat as a reference set of photometry .",
    "we treat the @xcite , glimpse , and wise photometry as belonging to 3 different epochs , fitting each epoch s sed separately .",
    "any @xmath31 , akari , or mips-24 photometry for a star is treated as common to the seds of all 3 `` epochs '' for that star . for oh 359 ,",
    "the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath3 m photometry from @xcite and glimpse agree fairly well with the wise 3.4 and 4.6 @xmath3 m photometry ; however , the 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath3 m @xcite and glimpse fluxes are about 3 times higher than it appears they should be , compared to the rest of the @xcite , glimpse , and wise photometry , so they were omitted from the sed - fitting .",
    "the discrepant photometry at 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath3 m may be due to the `` bandwidth effect '' , which results in artifacts appearing in 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath3 m data as point sources centered multiples of 4 pixels away from the star ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , if it is a bright star ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the image we show in the background of figure 1 has been processed so that the pixels are 0.6@xmath5 long , as opposed to 1.2@xmath5 in the original data , so the artifact point sources show up in figure 1 as multiples of 8 pixel away from the star .",
    "if not corrected , this artifact might affect 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath3 m fluxes for affected targets .",
    "we obtain dust mass - loss rates of 2.5 ( @xmath0 0.2 ) @xmath110@xmath32 , 8.4 ( @xmath0 1.1 ) @xmath110@xmath32 , 2.4 ( @xmath0 0.1 ) @xmath110@xmath32 , and 2.1 ( @xmath0 0.2 ) @xmath110@xmath32 for oh359 , e51 , a12 , and a51 , respectively , from the average of the best - fit model to each star s sed of the 3 `` epochs '' . for a51 ,",
    "glimpse photometry was not available , so there were only 2 `` epochs '' for a51 .",
    "note that this takes into account that these stars dust envelope expansion velocities are not 10 km  s@xmath6 , as assumed by @xcite ; rather , the oh359 , a12 , and a51 dust expansion velocities are assumed to be equal to the gas expansion velocities as observed by us ( table 2 ) , and the e51 dust expansion velocity is assumed to be the same as that reported for co by @xcite .",
    "this assumption that the dust expansion velocity is equal to the gas expansion velocity for agb star envelopes is only an approximation , as models that allow for drift of dust with respect to gas in these envelopes show that the dust may have slightly higher expansion velocities than the gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , as our dust models are always quite optically thick at 10 @xmath3 m wavelength ( note all the models seen in figures 13 - 16 have absorption in the 10 @xmath3 m feature ) , which means they are also quite optically thick at optical wavelengths and have relatively large gas mass - loss rates ( few times 10@xmath2 ; table 2 ) , these stars envelopes should not be in what @xcite called the `` drift - dominated regime '' .",
    "thus , drift of dust through the gas is less significant for the stars we discuss than for agb stars with lower mass - loss rates .",
    "we estimate uncertainties on the dust mass - loss rates for these 4 stars ( table 3 ) in the same way @xcite estimated uncertainties on their dust mass - loss rates ; that is , using the mad uncertainties determined from the 100 best - fit models ( again , here drawing only from the oxygen - rich grams models ) .",
    "this results in gas - to - dust ratios of about 310 ( @xmath0 89 ) , 220 ( @xmath0 110 ) , and 160 ( @xmath0 140 ) for oh359 , a12 , and a51 , respectively .",
    "the gas mass - loss rate for e51 is 6@xmath110@xmath2 ( a. winnberg , private communication ) .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty on the e51 gas mass - loss rate by propagating the co j=21 line f@xmath13 , v@xmath14 , and v@xmath16 1-@xmath33 uncertainties given by @xcite for e51 . from this",
    ", we estimate the gas mass - loss rate uncertainty for e51 to be about 2@xmath110@xmath2 .",
    "we then determine a gas - to - dust ratio for e51 of 71 ( @xmath0 23 ) .",
    "the dust mass - loss rates and gas - to - dust ratios for all 4 stars for which we modeled the dust shells using grams are also listed in table 3 .",
    "as @xcite note , solution 1 from @xcite is a formula to compute metallicity , [ fe / h ] , for stars using observations of various lines seen in near - infrared spectra . using this formula and the equivalent widths of various near - infrared lines reported by @xcite , a12",
    "is found to have a metallicity , [ fe / h ] , of -0.82 dex , e51 is found to have [ fe / h ] = -0.92 , and a51 is found to have [ fe / h ] = -0.38 .",
    "@xcite note the typical errors on metallicities determined by this method to be about 0.1 dex . using equivalent widths of the same near - infrared lines reported by @xcite",
    ", oh359 is found to have [ fe / h ] = -0.81 .",
    "the distribution of metallicities of the galactic bulge star sample of @xcite spans [ fe / h ] from 0.5 down to @xmath8 -2.0 dex , with the histogram of metallicities peaking around -0.3 dex .",
    "@xcite note the average metallicity of the local solar neighborhood sample of @xcite is [ fe / h ] @xmath34 -0.6 .",
    "thus , the metallicities of oh359 , e51 , and a12 are quite lower than solar , and all of them are slightly lower than that of the solar neighborhood .",
    "it is unknown why the gas - to - dust ratio for e51 is so low , especially considering the low metallicity of e51 .",
    "the average of the gas - to - dust ratios of all 4 stars for which co j=21 is detected - oh359 , a12 , and a51 ( by us ) and e51 ( by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) - is about 190 .",
    "this may be understood to be larger than the galactic bulge upper limit of @xmath25 160 ( see discussion at the beginning of this subsection ) due to the low metallicities of these stars as determined from their near - infrared spectra .",
    "it is also possible the dust mass - loss rates assumed for the gas - to - dust ratio calculations are uncertain due to such factors as these stars variability , differing dust properties than those assumed for our modeling , etc .",
    "we have obtained ground - based photometry and spectroscopy at near- and mid - infrared wavelengths of a number of our galactic bulge targets that we will use to constrain further the dust mass - loss rates and the dust properties of these stars ( sargent et al , _ in prep _ ) .",
    "we do note that the gas - to - dust ratios of oh359 , e51 , a12 , and a51 are consistent with the gas - to - dust ratios determined by @xcite for o - rich and c - rich agb stars in the milky way within about 8 kpc of earth . according to @xcite ,",
    "the period of e51 is 715 days , and according to @xcite , the periods of oh359 , a12 , and a51 are 692 , 552 , and 759 days , respectively .",
    "the gas - to - dust ratios we determine for these 4 stars are all consistent with the data in the plot of the logarithm of gas - to - dust ratio versus logarithm of period in figure 20 of @xcite .",
    "however , we caution against concluding too much regarding these gas - to - dust ratios , considering they are for a very small sample of 4 stars .",
    "we also note that the lower quality detections of a12 and ( especially ) a51 seem to result in relatively larger uncertainties on their gas - to - dust ratios . the uncertainty on the a51 gas - to - dust ratio seems to be dominated by the relatively large uncertainty on its gas mass - loss rate .",
    "this uncertainty probably arises largely from the huge uncertainty we assign to the expansion velocity , 6.0 @xmath0 4.2 km  s@xmath6 , which is due to the poorer data quality for this star s sma spectrum . for a51",
    ", we suggest follow - up observations of its co emission would establish firmly its detection and better constrain its gas mass - loss rate .",
    "as noted in the introduction , the goal of these studies of evolved star co emission is to constrain their gas - to - dust ratios , as there are few determinations of gas - to - dust ratios of evolved stars in the literature .",
    "the galactic bulge is an ideal place to make such determinations , as the distance to the stars is well - known ( @xmath48 kpc ) , which reduces uncertainty in these stars other properties ( e.g. , luminosity ) . by determining reliable gas - to - dust ratios for these stars , for which we also know metallicity ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we hope to be able to determine gas - to - dust ratios for lower - metallicity environments , like the magellanic clouds .",
    "we note specifically that oh359 , e51 , and a12 have metallicities very similar to that of the small magellanic cloud of [ fe / h ] = -0.64 @xcite , and a51 has a metallicity quite similar to that of the large magellanic cloud , which has [ fe / h ] = -0.30 @xcite ; therefore , our work applies to studies of mass loss in the magellanic clouds .",
    "this will aid in studies of the life cycle of matter of galaxies , by constraining the contribution of matter to the galaxy from its evolved star population .",
    "we noticed the spectra of all the targets in our sample included a lot of extended emission roughly between -180 km  s@xmath6 and + 180 km  s@xmath6 , not associated with any of our evolved star sample .",
    "however , outside of this velocity range , the emission was usually much weaker .",
    "@xcite similarly noted that significant interstellar background emission is usually found between -200 km  s@xmath6 and + 200 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "pursuing such high radial velocity sources may prove a successful means of detecting co emission at j=21 from evolved stars than the lower velocity sources , as our detection of oh359 demonstrates . in the @xcite sample alone",
    ", there are 7 oh maser sources with central oh maser velocities @xmath8 -180 km  s@xmath6 or @xmath20 + 180 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that @xcite took this sort of approach with the iram 30 m telescope in the co j=21 and co j=10 lines for a sample of 17 stars with moderately high radial velocities ( greater than + 100 km  s@xmath6 or less than -100 km  s@xmath6 ) and only detected 2 of them .",
    "observing co emission at higher j @xmath35 j-1 transitions should also prove fruitful for detecting co emission from galactic bulge stars .",
