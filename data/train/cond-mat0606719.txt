    "the discovery of superconductivity at anomalously high temperatures in cuprate materials caused a major revitalisation in the twin fields of correlated electrons and superconductivity .",
    "such large transition temperatures could not be explained consistently within the bcs approach , which is only accurate in the extreme adiabatic , weak coupling limit ( see e.g. refs @xcite ) .",
    "several mechanisms have been put forward to understand these compounds , including very strong el - ph coupling , with bipolarons forming a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in the finite density limit , leading to a bipolaronic superconductor ( bps ) @xcite .",
    "bps theory and other approaches such as extended eliashberg theory ( eet ) @xcite are applicable in certain limits , either strong coupling ( bps ) or weak couping ( bcs and eet ) .",
    "however , the cuprates ( and other strongly correlated electron systems ) often have intermediate coupling between electrons .",
    "thus , one can not expand about a well defined solution , and it is necessary to employ advanced simulation techniques @xcite .",
    "such techniques have the power to compute the numerically exact solution to a problem , and can provide definitive answers about the limits of validity of approximate schemes .    here",
    ", we simulate a coulomb - frhlich ( cf ) hamiltonian @xcite with two electrons of opposite spin , @xmath1 each ion has a displacement @xmath2 .",
    "sites labels are @xmath3 or @xmath4 for electrons and ions respectively .",

    "the phonons are einstein oscillators with frequency @xmath6 and mass @xmath7 .",

    "using the ctqmc algorithm @xcite , we compute the splitting between @xmath16 and @xmath17 bipolaron states with the estimator @xmath18 . in the @xmath17-state ,",

    "inverse effective mass is calculated as @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the twist in boundary conditions on the imaginary time axis .",
    "the bipolaron action @xcite extends the polaron action @xcite .",
    "we present triplet splitting in the coulomb - frhlich model . below a certain el - ph coupling ,",
    "the singlet - triplet pairing is degenerate , as coulomb repulsion stops pairing .",

    "we have used an advanced quantum - monte - carlo algorithm to simulate bipolarons in the presence of very strong coulomb repulsion with long - range el - ph interaction .",
    "we have used this algorithm to investigate the total energy of possible bipolaron pairing symmetries for the first time .    given experimental evidence for a @xmath0-component in the cuprates",

    "has recently been seen in the two dimensional holstein model as a consequence of large phonon frequency in an extended eliashberg theory @xcite . for the @xmath0-state ,",
    "the estimator is similar to the @xmath17-state , but now parallel end configurations contribute sign 1 and those rotated by @xmath27 sign -1 @xcite .",
    "new update rules are required in the d - state .",
    "the bipolaron action for rotated boundary conditions in time is complicated , and will be discussed later . while it is clear from the estimator for @xmath28 that a simple bipolaron pair can not have pure @xmath0-symmetry , when coulomb repulsion is large , @xmath0 and @xmath16-wave paired states can be close in energy .",
    "also , multipolaron effects may be capable of inducing a @xmath0-wave state @xcite .",
