    "discrete fourier transform ( dft ) is one of the most important tools in digital signal processing .",
    "dft is used in both analysis and synthesis of discrete signals and systems , and has frequent applications in optics , spectroscopy , magnetic resonance , quantum computing , seismology and astrophysics @xcite . in particular",
    ", dft allows discrete - time signals and systems to be analyzed in the frequency domain .",
    "dft is an invertible linear operator @xmath0 , that transforms a set of complex numbers , defining the signal @xmath1 , sampled on the time grid @xmath2 , @xmath3 , into another complex set of numbers:@xmath4=n^{-1}\\sum_{n=0}^{n-1}z_{n}e^{-2\\pi it_{n}\\bar{\\nu}_{m}},\\ ] ] where @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the frequency sampling grid .",
    "the inverse dft is defined as following:@xmath7=\\sum_{m=0}^{n-1}z_{m}e^{2\\pi it_{n}\\bar{\\nu}_{m}}.\\ ] ]",
    "a major short coming of dft is that it correctly recovers the fourier spectrum only if the signal contains frequencies from the sampling grid @xmath8 @xcite . in figure 1",
    "we give a dft failing recovery example where the signal has a fourier spectrum containing @xmath9 components with frequencies @xmath10 @xmath11 , that are not included in the sampling grid , i.e. @xmath12 .",
    "one can see that the spectrum obtained using dft does not even resemble the original frequency spectrum embedded in the signal . the standard approach to overcome this problem is to sample the signal at a larger number of points @xmath13 , such that the frequencies in the sampling grid begin to approximate well the frequencies embedded in the signal .",
    "this approach is obviously not feasible if one can sample the signal only at a fixed number of points , constrained by the experimental setting for example .",
    "the main question we would like to address here is how to recover exactly the fourier spectrum if the signal in question contains frequencies that do not fall on the sampling grid ? here , we derive an iterative method which recovers exactly the fourier spectrum embedded in the signal , and we provide an implementation algorithm which is robust to noise perturbations .",
    "the goal of the fourier spectrum recovery problem is to exactly find the fourier components @xmath14 , @xmath15 , from the signal:@xmath16 including the case when the frequencies @xmath10 do not fall on the sampling grid .",
    "we consider an iterative method , and we assume that initially @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and the residual is @xmath20^{t}\\in\\mathbb{\\mathbb{c}}^{n}$ ] . at every step the method uses a nonlinear optimization strategy to determine the amplitude @xmath21 and the frequency @xmath10 corresponding to the fourier component @xmath22^{t}\\in\\mathbb{\\mathbb{c}}^{n}$ ] , which minimize the residual in the least squares sense . a cyclic strategy is also employed to reassess and correct the @xmath23 parameters , while holding the others fixed . in order to reassess the component @xmath24 with the parameters @xmath23 we remove it from the solution , by adding its contribution to the residual:@xmath25 here , we have introduced the assign operator @xmath26 ( re - sets the _ @xmath27 _ with the returned value of the _ @xmath28 _ ) .",
    "now , we compute another set of parameters @xmath23 which minimize the residual @xmath29:@xmath30 where    @xmath31^{2}.\\ ] ]    by solving the above minimization problem we find a new set of parameters @xmath21 and @xmath10 , which will produce the residual:@xmath32 the new residual @xmath29 will be smaller or at least equal with the previous one , due to the intrinsic convergence mechanism of the method ( as shown below )",
    ". the worst case would be when the values of the reassessed parameters @xmath23 are identical with the initial ones and no correction can be made .",
    "obviously , this procedure can be repeated cyclically for each component until the norm of the residual becomes zero , or smaller than some prescribed positive threshold : @xmath33 . when the signal is contaminated with gaussian noise with zero mean and standard deviation @xmath34",
    ", the stopping threshold should be comparable with the standard deviation of the noise , i.e. @xmath35 .",
    "the major difficulty of the method is solving the successive nonlinear minimization problems ( 5 ) .",
    "the functions @xmath36 are highly nonlinear , with complex arguments and multiple local minima , which makes them very difficult for the existing algorithms @xcite . here",
    ", we develop a new iterative algorithm to solve the nonlinear minimization problem .",
    "first , we need to find an initial estimate @xmath10 .",
    "this is is done simply by solving the problem:@xmath37 where @xmath38 is the standard inner product operator in the complex hilbert space , and @xmath39 are the frequencies from the sampling grid @xmath8 .",
    "we also notice that the amplitude @xmath21 and the frequency @xmath10 can be `` decoupled '' , in the sense that for a given @xmath10 , one can easily calculate an estimate of @xmath21 as the projection of @xmath29 on @xmath40:@xmath41 this estimate of @xmath21 guarantees the decrease of the residual ( 7 ) , since we have:@xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 reciprocally , @xmath40 is orthogonal to the residual ( 7):@xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47    now , let us assume that @xmath48 is the unknown correction to @xmath10 in the next iteration step .",
    "therefore , we have:@xmath49 with@xmath50^{t},\\ ] ] and from here we easily find : @xmath51 again , this estimate of the correction @xmath48 guarantees a further decrease of the residual:@xmath52 since we have:@xmath53 @xmath54 reciprocally , the direction @xmath55 is also orthogonal to the next residual:@xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 after @xmath48 is determined , we update the frequency of the current component using @xmath59 ( since the frequency must be a real number ) and the residual : @xmath60 , and we perform a new iteration . the iterations stop when @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is a small acceptable error , or when the number of iterations exceed a maximum number .",
    "therefore , at every step , the method finds two directions @xmath40 and respectively @xmath63 , which are orthogonal to the next residual .",
    "the parameters @xmath23 are the projection of the current residual on these two directions . thus , as a consequence of the above proof , the method is guaranteed to converge .",
    "the pseudo - code of the exact fourier spectrum recovery ( efsr ) algorithm is given in algorithm 1 .",
    "@xmath64 ; signal    @xmath65 ; number of components to be recovered    @xmath66 ; admissible residual level    @xmath67 ; admissible frequency error    @xmath68 ; maximum number of correction cycles    @xmath69 ; maximum number of iterations per cycle    @xmath70 ; initial residual    @xmath71 ; cycle index    do\\ {    @xmath72 ;    @xmath73 ;    @xmath74 ;    @xmath75 ;    do\\ {    @xmath76 ;    @xmath77 ;    @xmath59 ;    @xmath78 ;    } while(@xmath79 and @xmath80 )    @xmath60 ;    @xmath81 ;    } while(@xmath82 and @xmath83 )    return @xmath14    in the example form figure 1 one can see that dft can not recover the spectrum at all , while the efsr method recovers exactly all the components in the fourier spectrum ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 ) in about @xmath87 iteration cycles .",
    "we should mention that the efsr method will recover exactly all the cases when the frequencies from the spectrum are well separated among them by at least the nyquist limit , which is the highest frequency that can be coded at a given sampling rate @xmath88 in order to be able to fully reconstruct the signal , i.e. @xmath89 .",
    "thus , for a successful recovery we must have : @xmath90 , for @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath15 .    in order to investigate the effect of the noise perturbation we consider the perturbed signal @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the measurement noise , i.e. a random variable normal distributed with mean @xmath95 and standard deviation @xmath34 . also , as a measure of noise contamination we use the signal to noise ratio defined as:@xmath96 where @xmath97 is the root mean square .    in figure 2",
    "we give an example with the signal to noise ratio : @xmath98 .",
    "one can see that the efsr method still recovers the spectrum almost exactly . in this case",
    "the iterations were stopped when the norm of the residual becomes comparable with the standard deviation @xmath34 of the noise in the measured data , i.e. when : @xmath99 , and thus @xmath100 . in order to estimate the recovery capabilities of the efsr method in the presence of noise , we define the following average relative errors between the recovered spectrum @xmath101 and the original spectrum @xmath14:@xmath102 @xmath103 the recovery errors as a function of the @xmath104",
    "are represented in figure 3 .",
    "the computation was performed by averaging over @xmath105 cases for each @xmath104 value , using the following parameters : @xmath106 , @xmath9 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 .",
    "the numerical results show that the method is robust to noise perturbations , and recovers the spectrum well up to @xmath107 , when begins to deteriorate . also , it is interesting to note that the error of the complex amplitudes @xmath108 grow much faster than the frequency error @xmath67 .",
    "this is due to the fact that by increasing the noise perturbation , the information about the phase of the amplitude is gradually lost , while the frequencies are still well recovered even for up to @xmath109 .",
    "faraday rotation is a physical phenomenon where the position angle of linearly polarized radiation propagating through a magneto - ionic medium is rotated as a function of frequency .",
    "recently , the faraday rotation measure ( rm ) synthesis has been re - introduced as an important method for analyzing multichannel polarized astrophysical radio data , where multiple emitting regions are present along the single line of sight of the observations . in practice , the method requires the recovery of the faraday depth function from measurements restricted to limited wavelength ranges , which is an ill - conditioned deconvolution problem , raising important computational difficulties ( see @xcite for a detailed description ) .",
    "faraday rotation is characterized by the faraday depth ( in @xmath110 ) , which is defined as:@xmath111 where @xmath112 is the electron density ( in @xmath113 ) , @xmath114 is the magnetic field ( in @xmath115 ) , and @xmath116 is the infinitesimal path length ( in parsecs ) .",
    "we also define the complex polarization as:@xmath117 where @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 are the observed stokes parameters .",
    "the observed polarization @xmath121 originates from the emission at all possible values of the faraday depth @xmath122 , such that :    @xmath123    where @xmath124 is the complex faraday depth function ( the intrinsic polarized flux , as a function of the faraday depth ) .",
    "thus , in principle @xmath124 is the inverse fourier transform of the observed quantity @xmath121:@xmath125 in general , the number of observations @xmath13 is limited by the number of independent measurement channels , and therefore there are many different potential faraday depth functions consistent with the measurements .",
    "the usual approach to resolving such ambiguities , is to impose some extra constraints on the faraday depth function . here ,",
    "we consider that the complex faraday depth function is approximated by a small number of components .",
    "more specifically , we assume that @xmath124 contains @xmath65 ( unknown ) dirac components @xmath126 , with complex amplitudes @xmath127 , and depths @xmath128 , @xmath19:@xmath129 taking the fourier transform of @xmath124 we obtain : @xmath130 the goal of the rm synthesis is to find @xmath124 from the observed values @xmath131 ( i.e. @xmath132 and @xmath133 ) over @xmath13 discrete channels @xmath134 $ ] , @xmath135 . from the numerical point of view",
    "one can apply the efsr method directly , by substituting the faraday depth and the squared wavelength with : @xmath136 and @xmath137 .    in figure 4",
    "we give such an example simulated for the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) experiment layout @xcite .",
    "the various parameters associated with the wsrt experiment layout are listed bellow :    wave length range : @xmath138 , @xmath139 ;    the width of an observing channel : @xmath140 ;    maximum observable faraday depth : @xmath141 ;    depth space resolution ( equivalent to half nyquist frequency ) : @xmath142 ;    we randomly generated @xmath143 sources with complex amplitudes , faraday depth @xmath144 .",
    "all the components are separated at the nyquist limit .",
    "we also added noise to the generated polarization vector @xmath121 , such that @xmath98 .",
    "one can see that while dft fails to recover the depth spectrum , while the efsr method correctly determines the all the components embedded in the polarization signal , with a small error in the phase , due to the ambiguity induced by the noise in the data .",
    "we have presented an exact fourier spectrum recovery method , which can be applied in all cases , including those in which the signal contains frequencies that are not corresponding to the sampling grid .",
