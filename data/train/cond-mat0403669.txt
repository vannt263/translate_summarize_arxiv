    "the study of networks is becoming increasingly popular ( for a recent review see @xcite and also @xcite ) .",
    "the main reason for that is an emergence of great wealth of data on internet , www , science citation networks , cell metabolism networks and so on . most of those networks ( if not all ) exhibit features that are not explained by the classical theory of random graphs due to erdos and renyi @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most prominent among those features is the power like degree distribution .",
    "degree of a vertex is the number of links connected to it . while classical theory predicts a poissonian distribution for the degree of a vertex in a random graph , in many of naturally occurring networks this distribution was found to have power  like tails .",
    "one way to understand this is based on an ancient observation `` for unto every one that hath shall be given , and he shall have abundance : but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.''@xcite : a popular web page is more probable to attract more links to it , a frequently cited paper is more likely to get more citations and so on . in more modern context",
    "this principle was formulated in @xcite and adopted to the description of networks in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this is a _",
    "approach concentrating on the description of growing networks .",
    "this is very natural as most of the networks we encounter are a result of some growth process .",
    "the simple models studied in the literature try to capture the essential features of the growth mechanism .",
    "one can look at the networks in a different way that is also quite natural as this is the approach taken in statistical mechanics and probability theory . in this",
    "_ synchronic _ view we treat each network as a single element of a _ statistical ensemble _ @xcite .",
    "the ensemble is defined by specifying the `` phase space '' that is the class of graphs belonging to it and the weight ( or probability ) for each graph in the ensemble .",
    "the probabilities can be assigned _ ad hoc _ or , what is more interesting , derived from other principles . in particular it is clear that each growing network model defines also a statistical ensemble .",
    "the ensemble consists of all the graphs that can be constructed by the specified growth process and the probability assigned to each graph is the probability of constructing given graph .",
    "thus the growth mechanism implicitly defines the probability for each graph .",
    "we find it worthwhile to study what kind of ensembles can be obtained from the growing network models @xcite .",
    "the motivation for this is twofold . first using another `` toolbox '' one can obtain more insight into original models .",
    "indeed we are in position to make some general statements about the correlation functions in growing random networks ( gn ) models .",
    "secondly while , as stated , natural networks are usually grown , often we may not have an access to the growth history and we are effectively left with the statistical ensemble approach .    in this contribution",
    "which is mostly based on @xcite we will describe a statistical ensemble that incorporates the causal structure inherent in the gn models .",
    "we will show how it relates to the gn models and derive some results on correlation functions .",
    "first we review very quickly the growing random network model @xcite . in the simplest version",
    "we start with a single vertex and then at each stage we attach a new vertex to one of the already existing ones . the probability for attaching the new @xmath1 vertex to some old one",
    "@xmath2 depends _ only _ on the degree @xmath3 of the node @xmath2 and is proportional to @xmath4 , which is called _",
    "attachment kernel_.    it is clear that this process produces a rooted , labeled tree , each node being labeled by the time at which it was inserted into the network and the first node being the root .",
    "it is also clear that not all the labelings are possible : the label of the `` father '' must be smaller then the label of its child .",
    "we will call trees that satisfy this condition _ causal_.    in order to define the weights we must calculate the probability for constructing a given tree @xmath5 . to obtain a node @xmath6 with degree @xmath7",
    "we must have attached a new node to the node with degree @xmath8 .",
    "the probability of this happening at the time @xmath6 is  : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the tree at the partial stage of the construction  : just before attaching the new node @xmath6 .",
    "unfortunately the normalizing factor in the denominator in general depends on the exact structure of the tree @xmath11 . in consequence",
    "the overall probability of building a tree will depend on the way it was constructed , in particular on the labeling .",
    "this problem is exemplified in the figure  [ fig : norm ] .",
    "this is situation apart from being impossible to work with is quite unnatural .",
    "what we would like is to have a weight that depend only on the nodes degree and do factorise  : @xmath12 it turns out that there exists a class of gn models that is compatible with the above requirement .",
    "those are the models with _ afine _ attachment kernels of the form  : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a constant . for such kernels",
    "the normalization factor depends only on the size of the tree  : @xmath15 for this class of attachment kernels the choice @xmath16 leads to a model _ identical _ with the original gn model . for other kernels we will still define our model by the formulas and . in this situation we can only expect some form of asymptotic or qualitative agreement between the models if any .",
    "in fact we as we will show later the two models can differ significantly even for very simple non - afine kernels .",

    "one further finds @xmath71 on a tree , the r.h.s .",
    "should equal 2 .",
    "this is the case when @xmath72 diverges at @xmath73 and hence @xmath74 .",
    "otherwise one encounters a pathology ( anomaly ) , which looks similar to that appearing in some maximally random tree models ( and in the so - called balls - in - boxes model , see @xcite ) , where in the large @xmath25 limit one misses singular node(s ) contributing term(s ) of the type @xmath75 such nonuniformly behaving terms disappear if one first takes the @xmath76 limit in .",
    "it will be shown later that the average distance between nodes is finite when @xmath77 .",
    "this means that singular node(s ) - with unbounded connectivity - are indeed expected to show up .      in order to check",
    "if the described anomaly really signals an appearance of a singular vertex we have studied causal trees with the weights @xmath78 where @xmath79 is an integer greater or equal to two , derived using from the _ delayed _ linear attachment kernel @xmath80 in this case the coefficients of the power series behave like  : @xmath81 the term @xmath82 in is obviously not zero and its value is found to be @xmath83 . in the figure  [ fig : cond ] we have ploted the result of simulations of the model of causal trees with 1000 and 4000 nodes ( circles and diamonds ) .",
    "one can clearly see peaks corresponding to the singular node .",
    "the vertical lines mark the positions of those peaks predicted from .",
    "the perfect agreement confirms our statement that the `` link deficiency '' in signals the existence of a singular node .",
    "[ c][c]@xmath7 [ c][c][1][-90]@xmath70 vertex degree distribution for causal trees ( 1000 nodes ( circles ) , 4000 nodes ( diamonds ) ) and gn model ( 4000 nodes ( triangles)),title=\"fig:\",width=453 ]    it is interesting to ask what is the shape of the vertex degree distribution for the growing random model which has exactly the same kernel . of course in this case the two models are not identical because the kernel is not afine .",
    "the resulting degree distribution for this model is ploted in the figure  [ fig : cond ] ( triangles ) @xcite .",
    "the continuous line is the approximate solution taken from @xcite .",
    "the observed discrepancy is due to finite size effects .",
    "as we can see the distributions in causal trees and growing networks differ greatly , in particular there is no singular vertex in the gn model for this choice of kernel .",
    "now , we turn to the calculation of the ancestor - descendant degree correlation .",
    "it is obvious that an ancestor plays the role of the root of the subgraph involving all its descendants .",
    "one can read from the degree distribution of the root : @xmath84 going over to the grand - canonical ensemble one finds : @xmath85 which , taking into account and after integration yields @xmath86 using similar arguments one writes the weight of graphs where the root has the degree @xmath87 and its daughter the degree @xmath26 as @xmath88 hence @xmath89 integrating the above equation one finally obtains @xmath90 which is the conditional probability , up to normalization , that a descendant has the degree @xmath26 when the ancestor s degree is @xmath87 .",
    "the normalization is determined summing over @xmath26 on the r.h.s .",
    "above , with the result @xmath91 .      repeating over and over the iteration process leading to eq",
    "one gets @xmath92 summing over node degrees @xmath93 one obtains the weight of all graphs with a point separated by @xmath94 links from the root , the two - point correlation function @xmath95 introduced in sect .",
    "1.2  : @xmath96 for finite @xmath59 , replacing the upper limit of integration over @xmath97 by @xmath59 and performing all integrations , one gets @xmath98 hence , the tail of @xmath95 falls at least as fast as a poissonian .",
    "consequently @xmath99 grows at most like @xmath100 . assuming that @xmath101 has at most a power singularity at @xmath102 one concludes that @xmath103 and therefore @xmath104 since @xmath105 scales like @xmath106 .",
    "the argument is rather heuristic , but suggestive ( see also the examples in the section iif of ref  @xcite ) .",
    "it appears that generically the causal trees have the _ small - world _",
    "property @xmath107 , contrary to the maximum entropy trees whose generic fractal dimension is finite @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is easy to understand intuitively  : the causal structure suppresses long branches .",
    "this can be seen by noting that along a branch from the root to the leaf no label permutations are possible , hence a tree with a few long branches admits much less causal labelings then a `` short fat '' one .",
    "we have studied a statistical ensemble of tree graphs endowed with a causal structure .",
    "we have derived some general formulas describing the degree distribution , the ancestor  descendant correlation , and the probability that a node lives at a given geodesic distance from the root . using these last results",
    ", we have shown that our causal networks have generically the small  world property their hausdorff dimension is infinite .",
    "we have shown that our model coincides with the growing random model for a afine class of attachment kernels . outside this class",
    "however the models can wildly differ .",
    "in particular we have demonstrated that while condensation of links can be observed in causal trees it is not to be seen in their growing network analogue ( for the same weights ) .",
