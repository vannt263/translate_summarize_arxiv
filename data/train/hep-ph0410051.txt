    "to discuss actually the nature of the putative nonet of the light scalar mesons : the red putative @xmath3 ( or @xmath4 ) and @xmath5 mesons and the red well established @xmath2 and @xmath1 mesons , one should explain not only their mass spectrum , particularly the mass degeneracy of the @xmath2 and @xmath1 states , but answer the next real challenges .    1 .   the copious @xmath6 decay and especially the copious @xmath7 decay , which looks as the decay plainly forbidden by the okubo - zweig - izuka ( ozi ) rule in the quark - antiquark model @xmath8 .",
    "2 .   absence of @xmath9 and @xmath10 with copious @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 if @xmath1 and @xmath2 are @xmath14-wave states of @xmath15 like @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively .",

    "4 .   suppression of @xmath22 and @xmath23 with copious @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 if @xmath1 and @xmath2 are @xmath14-wave state of @xmath15 like @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively .",
    "unfortunately , i have opportunity to dwell on the @xmath0 radiative decays only in this talk .",
    "study of the nature of light scalar resonances has become a central problem of non - perturbative of qcd .",
    "the point is that the elucidation of their nature is important for understanding both the confinement physics and the chiral symmetry realization way in the low energy region , i.e. , the main consequences of qcd in the hadron world .",
    "@xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 mixes left and right spaces @xmath30 and @xmath31 . but in chiral limit @xmath32 these spaces separate realizing @xmath33 flavour symmetry , @xmath34 , which , however , is broken by the gluonic anomaly up to @xmath35 . as experiment suggests , confinement forms colourless observable hadronic fields and spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry with massless pseudoscalar fields .",
    "there are two possible scenarios for ocd at low energy .",
    "1 .   non - linear @xmath36-model .",
    "@xmath37 2 .",
    "linear @xmath36-model .",
    "@xmath38    the experimental nonet of the light scalar mesons , the putative @xmath3 ( or @xmath4 ) and @xmath39 mesons and the well established @xmath2 and @xmath1 mesons as if suggests the @xmath33 linear @xmath36-model .",
    "hunting the light @xmath36 and @xmath40 mesons had begun in the sixties already and a preliminary information on the light scalar mesons in particle data group ( pdg ) reviews had appeared at that time .",
    "but long - standing unsuccessful attempts to prove their existence in a conclusive way entailed general disappointment and an information on these states disappeared from pdg reviews .",
    "one of principal reasons against the @xmath36 and @xmath40 mesons was the fact that both @xmath41 and @xmath42 scattering phase shifts do not pass over @xmath43 at putative resonance masses .",
    "situation changes when we showed ( 1994 ) that in the linear @xmath36-model @xmath44 + \\left(\\mu^2/2\\right)\\left [ ( \\sigma)^2+(\\vec{\\pi})^2\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & - \\left(\\lambda/4\\right)\\left [ ( \\sigma)^2+(\\vec{\\pi})^2\\right ] ^2 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] there is a negative background phase which hides the @xmath36 meson .",
    "it has been made clear that shielding wide lightest scalar mesons in chiral dynamics is very natural .",
    "this idea was picked up and triggered new wave of theoretical and experimental searches for the @xmath36 and @xmath40 mesons .",
    "we considered the simplest dyson equation for the @xmath41 scattering amplitude with real intermediate @xmath41 states only ( 1994 ) .",

    "nevertheless , now there are the possibilities to estimate odds of the @xmath33 linear @xmath36-model to underlie physics of light scalar mesons in phenomenology .",
    "really , even now there is a huge body of information about the @xmath46- waves of different two - particle pseudoscalar states and what is more the relevant information go to press almost continuously from bes , bnl , cern , cesr , da@xmath47ne , fnal , kek , slac and others .",
    "as for theory , we know quite a lot about the scenario under discussion : the nine scalar mesons , the putative chiral shielding of the @xmath4 and @xmath48 mesons , the unitarity and adler self - consistency conditions . in addition , there is the light scalar meson treatment motivated by field theory .",
    "the foundations of this approach were formulated in our papers ( 1979 - 1984 ) .",
    "the nontrivial nature of the well established light scalar resonances @xmath2 and @xmath1 is no longer denied practically anybody . in particular , there exist numerous evidences in favour of the @xmath49 structure of these states . as for the nonet as a whole ,",
    "even a dope s look at pdg review gives an idea of the four - quark structure of the light scalar meson nonet , @xmath4 , @xmath39 , @xmath2 , and @xmath1 , inverted in comparison with the classical @xmath14-wave @xmath15 tensor meson nonet , @xmath17 ,    @xmath16 , @xmath50 , @xmath51",
    ". really , while the scalar nonet can not be treated as the @xmath14-wave @xmath52 in the naive quark model , it can be easy understood as the @xmath49 nonet , where @xmath4 has no strange quarks , @xmath39 has the @xmath53 quark , @xmath2 and @xmath1 have the @xmath54 pair , r.l .",
    "jaffe , j. schechter et al ..    the scalar mesons @xmath1 and",
    "@xmath2 , discovered more than thirty years ago , became the hard problem for the naive @xmath15 model from the outset . really , on the one hand the almost exact degeneration of the masses of the isovector @xmath1 and isoscalar @xmath2 states revealed seemingly the structure similar to the structure of the vector @xmath55 and @xmath56 mesons , and on the other hand the strong coupling of @xmath2 with the @xmath57 channel as if suggested a considerable part of the strange pair @xmath54 in the wave function of @xmath2 .    in 1977",
    "jaffe noted that in the mit bag model , which incorporates confinement phenomenologically , there are light four - quark scalar states .",
    "he suggested also that @xmath1 and @xmath2 might be these states with symbolic structures @xmath58 from that time @xmath1 and @xmath2 resonances came into beloved children of the light quark spectroscopy .",
    "ten years later we showed that the study of the radiative decays @xmath59 and @xmath60 can shed light on the problem of @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons . over the next ten years before experiments ( 1998 )",
    "the question was considered from different points of view .",
    "now these decays have been studied not only theoretically but also experimentally .",
    "the first measurements have been reported by the snd and cmd-2 collaborations which obtain the following branching ratios @xmath61    more recently the kloe collaboration has measured @xmath62 in agreement with the novosibirsk data but with a considerably smaller error .",
    "note that @xmath1 is produced in the radiative @xmath0 meson decay as intensively as @xmath63 containing @xmath64 of @xmath54 , responsible for @xmath65 .",
    "it is a clear qualitative argument for the presence of the @xmath54 pair in the isovector @xmath1 state , i.e. , for its four - quark nature .      when basing the experimental investigations , we suggested one - loop model @xmath66 .",
    "this model is used in the data treatment and is ratified by experiment .    below we argue on gauge invariance grounds that the present data give the conclusive arguments in favor of the @xmath67-loop transition as the principal mechanism of @xmath1 and @xmath2 meson production in the @xmath0 radiative decays .",
    "this enables to conclude that production of the lightest scalar mesons @xmath1 and @xmath2 in these decays is caused by the four - quark transitions , resulting in strong restrictions on the large @xmath68 expansions of the decay amplitudes .",
    "the analysis shows that these constraints give new evidences in favor of the four - quark nature of @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons .      to describe the experimental spectra @xmath69",
    "the function @xmath70 should be smooth ( almost constant ) in the range @xmath71 gev .",
    "but the problem issues from gauge invariance which requires that @xmath72\\nonumber\\\\[3pt ] & & = g_r(m)\\left [ p_\\mu e_\\nu(\\phi ) - p_\\nu e_\\mu(\\phi)\\right]\\left [ k_\\mu e_\\nu(\\gamma ) - k_\\nu e_\\mu(\\gamma)\\right].\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] consequently , the function @xmath73 is proportional to the photon energy @xmath74 ( at least ! ) in the soft photon region .    stopping the function @xmath75 at @xmath76 mev with the help of the form - factor @xmath77 $ ] requires @xmath78 gev@xmath79 .",
    "it seems to be incredible to explain such a huge radius in hadron physics .",
    "based on rather great @xmath80 gev@xmath79 , one can obtain an effective maximum of the mass spectrum only near 900 mev .    to exemplify this trouble",
    "let us consider the contribution of the isolated @xmath81 resonance : @xmath82 .",
    "let also the mass and the width of the @xmath81 resonance equal 980 mev and 60 mev , then @xmath83 .",
    "so stopping the @xmath84 function is the crucial point in understanding the mechanism of the production of @xmath1 and @xmath2 resonances in the @xmath0 radiative decays .",
    "the @xmath67-loop model @xmath85 solves this problem in the elegant way : fine threshold phenomenon is discovered , see fig .",
    "= 8.5 cm    to demonstrate the threshold character of this effect we present fig .",
    "[ gg ] and fig .",
    "[ ggg ] in which the function @xmath86 is shown in the case of @xmath87 meson mass is 25 mev and 50 mev less than in reality .    as seen from figs .",
    "[ gg ] and [ ggg ] , the function @xmath86 is suppressed by the @xmath75 law in the region 950 - 1020 mev and 900 - 1020 mev respectively . in the mass spectrum",
    "this suppression is increased by one more power of @xmath88 , so that we can not see the resonance in the region 980 - 995 mev .",
    "the spectrum maximum is effectively shifted to the region 935 - 950 mev and 880 - 900 mev respectively .    in truth",
    "this means that @xmath1 and @xmath2 resonances are seen in the radiative decays of @xmath0 meson owing to the @xmath67 intermediate state , otherwise the maxima in the spectra would be shifted to 900 mev .",
    "so the mechanism of production of @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons in the @xmath0 radiative decays is established .",
    "both real and imaginary parts of the @xmath89 amplitude are caused by the @xmath67 intermediate state .",
    "the imaginary part is caused by the real @xmath67 intermediate state while the real part is caused by the virtual compact @xmath67 intermediate state , i.e. , we are dealing here with the four - quark transition .",
    "needless to say , radiative four - quark transitions can happen between two @xmath15 states as well as between @xmath15 and @xmath49 states but their intensities depend strongly on a type of the transitions .",
    "a radiative four - quark transition between two @xmath52 states requires creation and annihilation of an additional @xmath15 pair , i.e. , such a transition is forbidden according to the okuba - zweig - izuka ( ozi ) rule , while a radiative four - quark transition between @xmath15 and @xmath49 states requires only creation of an additional @xmath15 pair , i.e. , such a transition is allowed according to the ozi rule .",
    "let us consider this problem from the large @xmath68 expansion standpoint , using the g.t hooft rules : @xmath90 at @xmath91 and a gluon is equivalent to a quark - antiquark pair ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "the point is that the large @xmath68 expansion is the most clear heuristic understanding of the ozi rule because the ozi forbidden branching ratio as a rule is suppressed by the factor @xmath93 , but not @xmath94 , in comparison with the ozi allowed decay . in our case",
    "the results of the analysis are even more interesting .",
    "the analysis shows that the @xmath95 decay intensity in the two - quark model and the @xmath96 decay intensity in the @xmath97 model are suppressed by the factor @xmath98 in comparison with the ones in the four - quark model , but in the @xmath99 model the @xmath100 decay intensity is suppressed only by the factor @xmath101 in comparison with the one in the four - quark model . in this model , in addition to the serious trouble with the @xmath102 mass degeneration , the @xmath103 order transition without creation of an additional @xmath15 pair @xmath104 ( similar to the principal mechanism of the @xmath105 decay ) is bound to have a small weight in the large @xmath68 expansion of the @xmath106 amplitude , because this term does not contain the @xmath67 intermediate state , which emerges only in the next to leading term of the @xmath107 order , i.e. , in the ozi forbidden transition .",
    "so , in this model the @xmath106 amplitude has the @xmath107 order like the @xmath108 one . emphasize that the mechanism without creation and annihilation of the additional @xmath109 pair can not explain the @xmath2 spectrum because it does not contain the @xmath67 intermediate state !",
    "so , the fine threshold phenomenon is discovered , which is to say that the @xmath67 loop mechanism of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 scalar meson production in the @xmath0 radiative decays is established at a physical level of proof .",
    "the case is rarest in hadron physics .",
    "this production mechanism is the four - quark transition what constrains the large @xmath68 expansion of the @xmath7 and @xmath110 amplitudes and gives the new strong ( if not crucial ) evidences in favor of the four - quark nature of @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons .",
