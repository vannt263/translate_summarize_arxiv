    "the question of realizing a property in a definable uniform way is prominent in effective descriptive set theory .",
    "one of the most important examples is the _ souslin - kleene theorem _ , which says that the separation property of the analytic sets can be realized by a recursive function in the codes . in this article",
    "we provide the uniform version of two more separation results about analytic sets , the dyck and the preiss separation .",
    "we point out that the proofs of the latter two results that are available in the bibliography ( see @xcite and @xcite ) use reduction to contradiction , so we need first to give direct proofs to the dyck and the preiss separation .",
    "more specifically we will define in each case a well - founded tree , which realizes the separation between the given analytic sets .",
    "we point out that the separation in each of these theorems is fundamentally different from the usual separation of analytic sets . more specifically in the dyck separation , while the inductive step remains the same , we have a smaller choice of sets at the bottom level . on the other hand , in the preiss separation",
    "the bottom level is not very far from the usual one , however the inductive step is more restrictive .",
    "these facts are reflected in our separation trees .",
    "we proceed to the presentation of our main results .",
    "concerning the * dyck separation theorem * we consider for all @xmath0  the subsets of @xmath1 , @xmath2 a set @xmath3 is _ positive _ if it belongs to the least family of subsets of @xmath1 , which contains @xmath4 , and is closed under countable unions as well as countable intersections .",
    "similarly a set @xmath3 is _ semi - positive _ if it belongs to the least family of sets , which contains @xmath5 , and is closed under countable unions / intersections .",
    "clearly every positive set is semi - positive , and it is also not hard to verify that every semi - positive set @xmath3 , which is not one of @xmath6 , @xmath1 is in fact positive .",
    "moreover positive sets are different from @xmath6 , @xmath1 .",
    "to see this we remark that every positive set @xmath7 satisfies @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the constant sequence @xmath10 for @xmath11 .",
    "hence the positive sets are exactly the semi - positive ones , which are non - empty and have non - empty complement .    for @xmath12",
    "we write @xmath13 if @xmath14 .",
    "a set @xmath3 is _ monotone _ if for all @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath13 we have @xmath17 .",
    "it follows easily that every positive set is monotone .",
    "the converse is also true for borel sets which differ from @xmath6 and @xmath1 :    [ theorem dyck ] suppose that @xmath7 and @xmath18 are disjoint non - empty @xmath19[0pt]{$\\underset{\\widetilde{}}{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}$}\\mbox{\\hskip 1pt}}}}^1_1 $ ] subsets of @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath7 is monotone then there is a positive borel set @xmath20 such that @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "in particular a borel subset @xmath7 of @xmath1 with @xmath23 is monotone exactly when it is positive .    in the last assertion of the preceding result",
    "it is necessary to have that the given set @xmath7 is borel , since all positive sets are evidently borel .",
    "it is natural to ask if there are monotone sets , which are not borel and therefore not positive as well .",
    "as it is probably expected the answer is affirmative .",
    "we will in fact show a slightly stronger assertion in proposition [ proposition a sig monotone set which is not borel ] below .    in our uniform version of the dyck separation ,",
    "we ask for a function which carries codes for the analytic sets @xmath7 and @xmath18 to a code for the semi - positive separating set @xmath24 . here the term  code \" has various interpretations . in the case of the analytic sets ,",
    "we mean a parameter @xmath25 from a fixed universal set .",
    "borel code _ is a parameter @xmath26 , which encodes the countable unions and complements , which are necessary to build the corresponding borel set .",
    "the analogous notion of a _ semi - positive code _ can be given , by using countable unions and intersections .",
    "these notions are given explicitly in the sequel ( see [ subsection borel codes ] and [ subsection semi - positive codes ] for the latter two ) .",
    "our uniform version of the dyck separation is    [ theorem uniformity version dyck ] there are recursive functions @xmath27 such that whenever @xmath28 are analytic codes for disjoint sets @xmath7 , @xmath18 respectively with @xmath7 being monotone , then there is a semi - positive set @xmath24 with @xmath21 , @xmath22 and such that    @xmath29 is a borel code for @xmath24 ;    @xmath30 is a semi - positive code for @xmath24 .    the proof will be given in section [ section the uniform dyck separation ] of this article .",
    "one notable consequence of the suslin - kleene theorem is that @xmath31 ,  the sets which are obtained by starting with the semi - recursive sets and applying transfinitely the operations of recursive union and complement are the same as the effective bi - analytic ( in other words @xmath32 ) sets .",
    "theorem [ theorem uniformity version dyck ] has a similar consequence .",
    "the effective version of a semi - positive set can be understood in the following two ways : ( a ) one considers the semi - positive sets , which are @xmath33 ; ( b ) one considers the semi - positive sets , which are constructed by recursive countable unions and intersections using codes just as in the definition of @xmath34 .    we show that the preceding two ways deliver the same class of sets .

    "next we move to the * preiss separation theorem*. a subset @xmath7 of @xmath35 , where @xmath36 , is _ convexly generated _ if it belongs to the least family , which contains all compact convex sets and is closed under countable increasing unions as well as countable intersections . as in the case of borel and semi - positive sets , one can encode the family of convexly generated sets using the _ convexly generated codes _ - the precise definition is given in [ subsection convexly generated codes and the proof to the uniform preiss separation theorem ] .",
    "it is evident that all convexly generated subsets of @xmath35 are borel .",
    "klee @xcite asked whether the converse is correct , and has answered this affirmatively in the case @xmath37 , cf .",
    "larman @xcite proved the analogous result in the case @xmath38 , and finally preiss @xcite gave a proof for arbitrary @xmath36 :    [ theorem preiss separation ] suppose that @xmath39 are disjoint @xmath19[0pt]{$\\underset{\\widetilde{}}{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}$}\\mbox{\\hskip 1pt}}}}^1_1 $ ] subsets of @xmath35 .",

    "it is worth noting the related result of holick @xcite that theorem [ theorem preiss separation ] does not extend to the infinite dimensional separable banach spaces , where in the definition of convexly generated sets we replace the term  compact convex \" with  closed convex \" .",
    "unlike the case of dyck separation , we are not able to obtain a recursive uniformity function , but rather a @xmath32-recursive .",
    "the reason for this boils down to the fact that we are dealing with subsets of the euclidean space .",
