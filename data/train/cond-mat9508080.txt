    "consider a quantum system on an infinite lattice described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 , with @xmath1 a dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "for any reasonable @xmath1 , all observable properties of the _ ground state _ of @xmath2 will vary smoothly as @xmath1 is varied",
    ". however , there may be special points , like @xmath3 , where there is a non - analyticity in some property of the ground state : we identify @xmath4 as the position of a quantum phase transition . in finite lattices ,",
    "non - analyticities can only occur at level crossings ; the possibilities in infinite systems are richer as avoided level crossings can become sharp in the thermodynamic limit . in this paper , i will restrict my discussion to second order quantum transitions , or transitions in which the correlation length and correlation time diverge as @xmath1 approaches @xmath4 .",
    "as i will review below , any such quantum transition can be used to define a continuum quantum field theory ( cqft ) : the cqft has no intrinsic short - distance ( or ultraviolet ) cutoff .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to review some recent work  @xcite on the properties of @xmath5 at _ finite temperatures _ ( @xmath6 ) in the vicinity of @xmath3 .",
    "this is equivalent to a study of the finite @xmath6 crossovers of the associated cqft .",
    "we shall focus especially on the dynamic properties of a ubiquitous finite @xmath6 region , usually called `` quantum critical ''  @xcite ( as we shall see below , there are reasons why this name is misleading and not quite appropriate ; nevertheless , i will use it here ) .",
    "the quantum - critical region appears as the high @xmath6 limit of the cqft ; unlike the statics of classical lattice models , the high @xmath6 limit of a cqft is usually highly non - trivial .",
    "all of this discussion will take place in the context of some simple examples drawn from quantum spin systems .",
    "i set the stage by reviewing the wilsonian approach to critical phenomena and field theories  @xcite , using the perspective of quantum critical phenomena . by the usual trotter product decomposition",
    ", we can set up the partition function of @xmath0 as a functional integral over degrees of freedom which fluctuate as a function of the spatial co - ordinate @xmath7 and imaginary time @xmath8 .",
    "let us now examine the behavior of this functional integral under the rescaling transformation  @xcite @xmath9 the dynamic exponent @xmath10 determines the relative scaling dimensions of space and time co - ordinates .",
    "the critical point at @xmath3 is a fixed point of ( [ rg ] ) , and @xmath11 is a relevant perturbation away from this point .",
    "we have therefore the flow equation @xmath12 which defines the critical exponent @xmath13 .",
    "( for simplicity i do not discuss the case of fixed points with more than one relevant perturbation , as they can be treated in a similar manner ) . in the long - distance , long - time limit",
    ", this deviation from the critical point will be characterized by some _",
    "renormalized _ energy scale , @xmath14 .",
    "i emphasize that @xmath14 is a dimensionful parameter , expressed in the laboratory units of energy , and directly measurable in an experiment ; a typical example would be an energy gap . in the vicinity of the critical point",
    ", the renormalized energy scale @xmath14 will be related to the bare coupling @xmath1 by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an ultraviolet cutoff , measured for convenience in the units of energy too . from the perspective of a field theorist ,",
    "the cqft associated with the quantum critical point is now defined by taking the limit @xmath17 at fixed @xmath14 ; from ( [ gg ] ) we see that , because @xmath18 , it is possible to take this limit by tuning the bare coupling @xmath1 closer and closer to the critical point as @xmath16 increases .",
    "( a condensed matter physicist would take the complementary , but equivalent , perspective of keeping @xmath16 fixed but moving closer to criticality by lowering his probe frequency @xmath19 ) .",
    "the resulting cqft then contains only the energy scale @xmath14 . at finite temperatures ,",
    "there is a second energy scale @xmath6 ( using units in which @xmath20 ) ; its thermodynamic properties will then be a universal function of the only dimensionless ratio available@xmath21 .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to review recent work on the crossovers as a function of @xmath21 in a number of systems , and to highlight the unusual properties of the heretofore unexplored high - temperature , `` quantum critical '' , limit of the cqft , @xmath22 .",
    "it is now easy to see why the high @xmath6 limit of the cqft can be non - trivial . a conventional high @xmath6 expansions of the lattice model @xmath2 proceeds with the series @xmath23 the successive terms in this series are well - defined and finite because of the ultraviolet cutoffs provided by the lattice .",
    "further , the series is well - behaved provided @xmath6 is larger than all other energy scales ; in particular we need @xmath24 .",
    "in contrast , the cqft was defined by the limit @xmath17 at fixed @xmath6 , @xmath14 , so the high @xmath6 limit of the cqft corresponds to the intermediate temperature range @xmath25 of the lattice model .",
    "it is not possible to access this temperature range by an expansion as simple as ( [ hight ] ) , and more sophisticated techniques , to be discussed here , are necessary .",
    "( one could also , of course , determine a large number of terms in ( [ hight ] ) and then use some pad extrapolation methods to access the @xmath26 region : this method has been used by sokol _ et .",
    "@xcite and i will not discuss it here ) .",
    "in contrast to the static properties , the dynamic properties of @xmath2 are already non - trivial in the high @xmath24 limit of the lattice model .",
    "although one expects some sort of incoherent , dissipative dynamics , the damping co - efficients can not be determined directly  all the approaches used so far are essentially variants of the methods discussed by moriya  @xcite and forster  @xcite , and use a short - time expansion , coupled with an ansatz for the spectral function , to extrapolate to the long - time limit . in this paper , we will discuss the dynamics in the high @xmath6 limit of the cqft , @xmath27 , or the `` quantum - critical dynamics '' .",
    "the dynamics continues to be dissipative and relaxational , but is not amenable to a description either by a classical boltzmann equation for a dilute gas of quasiparticle excitations , or by a classical langevin - like models of the types discussed in the classic review of hohenberg and halperin  @xcite .",
    "however , as we shall show , the scaling structure of the cqft does permit some progress to be made ; indeed we will discuss below the complete solution of the quantum - critical dynamics of a simple spin model , including the exact determination of a damping co - efficient .",
    "we will begin our discussion with a simple solvable model of spinless fermions in section  [ spinferm ] : this will allow introduction of the main concepts in a very simple setting .",
    "section  [ sec : bose ] will extend these results to a related but more complex model of dilute bosons in spatial dimensions @xmath28 .",
    "an explicit solution of the relaxational dynamics of the quantum - critical region will be obtained in the discussion in section  [ isingsec ] on the ising model in a transverse field .",
    "the expository analyses of these toy models will lead in section  [ secrotor ] to the main system of interest  the @xmath29 quantum rotor model in @xmath30 .",
    "we will also review applications of these results to numerical simulations and experiments .",
    "finally section  [ concsec ] will conclude by highlighting the main results and noting recent work on related subjects .",
    "much of the physics i wish to discuss is displayed in a surprisingly simple model of a dilute gas of spinless fermions at finite temperature : its scaling forms have a structure identical to those of much more complicated models .",
    "the main shortcoming of the model is that the associated cqft has no interactions , and there is therefore no relaxational behavior in the scaling functions .",
    "consider the following hamiltonian : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a spinless fermion annihilation operator at the site @xmath33 of a @xmath34-dimensional hypercubic lattice , and @xmath35 are nearest neighbors .",
    "there are no interactions in @xmath36 , so it is trivially solvable . consider the ground state of @xmath37 as a function of the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath38 . for @xmath39 ,",
    "the ground state has no particles .",
    "there is a non - analytic onset in the density of particles at @xmath3 , signaling a quantum phase transition .",
    "the bandwidth @xmath40 of the fermions plays the role of the upper cutoff in energy ( @xmath16 ) for this transition , and the critical region defining the applicability of a cqft is roughly @xmath41 .",
    "in fact , it is not difficult to determine the exact effective action of the cqft ( in units with @xmath42 ) : @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the lattice spacing . for this action we can identify by the usual methods the exponents @xmath47 and @xmath48 at the @xmath49 critical point ; taking the density @xmath50 as the order parameter",
    ", we get the exponents @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "further , it is also easy to see that all interactions are irrelevant at this critical point in all dimensions @xmath53 ( the least irrelevant interaction term , @xmath54 , becomes relevant only for @xmath55 ) . finally , for the renormalized energy scale measuring the deviation from the critical point , @xmath14 , we may take @xmath56 , the bare chemical potential in @xmath37 .",
    "note that there is no non - universal scale - factor in the relationship between @xmath14 and @xmath57this is a consequence of the triviality of the critical exponents .",
    "more typical models with anomalous exponents will have non - universal scale - factors .",
    "we show in fig  [ fermifig ] the phase diagram of @xmath37 as a function of @xmath58 and @xmath6 .",
    "our interest is primarily in the regions within the hatched lines where the cqft ( [ cqft1 ] ) applies . within this region",
    "there are three physically distinct types of behavior ( a , b and c ) : as @xmath59 is trivially solvable , the universal properties of a , b , and c and the crossovers between them can be exactly determined .",
    "let us describe the regions in turn :    \\(a ) _ activated _ @xmath60 : the fermions are very dilute , with a density @xmath61 .",
    "quantum effects are suppressed and the particles behave classically .",
    "\\(b ) _ fermi or luttinger liquid _ @xmath62 : now quantum degeneracy effects are paramount . at @xmath63 ,",
    "the ground state is a fermi liquid ( in @xmath64 , a luttinger liquid ) ; at finite @xmath6 thermal effects lead to a small number of particle and hole excitations near the fermi surface .",
    "\\(c ) _ quantum critical _ @xmath65 : unlike a and b , the temperature @xmath6 is the most important energy scale in this region .",
    "we can set @xmath66 here without much damage ( all corrections involve positive powers of @xmath67 ) .",
    "the energy of a typical excitation in this region is of order @xmath6 and as a result , quantum and thermal fluctuations are equally important .    the relationships between the regions becomes clearer upon considering an explicit example of a crossover function .",
    "the density of particles @xmath68 obeys the scaling form @xmath69 where the universal scaling function @xmath70 is given by @xmath71 notice that there are no arbitrary scale - factors in ( [ phin ] ) . in the activated region a ( @xmath72 ) , we have @xmath73 , which is exactly the result we would have obtain from the classical maxwell - boltzmann statistics . in the fermi liquid region",
    "b ( @xmath74 ) , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the volume of the unit sphere in @xmath34 dimensions ; this is the fully quantum result obtained by filling up the fermi sphere .",
    "most interesting is the quantum critical region c ( @xmath77 where @xmath78 the value of @xmath79 depends upon the details of the fermi distribution function , and not just its forms in the classical and quantum limits : this illustrates our assertion that quantum and classical effects are equally important in region c.    it is also interesting to compare the behavior of the density in the universal region c with the true high temperature limit of the lattice model - region d. in other words , we are going vertically upwards in @xmath6 at @xmath66 in fig  [ fermifig ] .",
    "it is easy to compute : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a non - universal constant ( recall that in this model @xmath56 and @xmath82 ) .",
    "notice the difference between the universal high @xmath6 limit of the cqft ( the first result ) and the lattice high @xmath6 limit .",
    "i hope that this example has illustrated the general principle , and in the remainder of the paper i will make no further reference to non - universal regions like d. it will be implicitly assumed that we are working with the universal continuum theory , and we will describe only regions like a , b and c.    before closing our discussion on this deceptively simple model , we discuss the scaling form of observables as a function of momentum @xmath83 and frequency @xmath84 . because of the absence of interactions , the single - particle green s function is trivial ; so we discuss the density - density correlator @xmath85 which has a slightly more interesting structure . as the particles are free , @xmath86 is of course given simply by the lindhard function , which can be manipulated into the scaling form @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a universal complex - valued function related to the lindhard function .",
    "notice that , like the scaling form ( [ phin ] ) , there are again no arbitrary scale factors .",
    "further , @xmath88 is well - defined at @xmath89 , where it yields the dynamic susceptibility of the quantum - critical region c. we will see several other examples of scaling forms like ( [ phin ] ) and ( [ phichin ] ) in this paper , but the scaling functions will not be as simple as they are here .",
    "now we consider the same density onset quantum transition considered in sec  [ spinferm ] , but for the case of bosons .",
    "the discussion here is drawn from that of sachdev , senthil and shankar  @xcite to which the reader is referred for further details .",
    "unlike the case for spinless fermions , it is no longer possible to ignore the interactions between the particles .",
    "we consider the properties of the following continuum model @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a boson annihilation operator , and @xmath92 is a repulsive interaction of range @xmath93 . like @xmath59 , @xmath94 has a quantum phase transition at @xmath95 , and we will discuss its universal properties here . because of the finite range of @xmath96 , the universality only sets in at distances larger than @xmath46 .",
    "a straightforward rg analysis  @xcite of the vicinity of the quantum critical point shows that @xmath96 flows into the @xmath97 fixed point for @xmath98 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath96 is actually dangerously irrelevant for @xmath98 : we do not wish to enter into a discussion of such effects here , and so most of our remaining discussion will be restricted to @xmath99 .    for @xmath28 ,",
    "@xmath92 flows into a universal fixed point interaction @xmath100 for some @xmath34 dependent constant @xmath101 .",
    "the scaling structure of this fixed point turns out to be very closely related to the non - interacting spinless fermion model of sec  [ spinferm ] for the same value of @xmath34 .",
    "all exponents and scaling forms of the boson and fermion models are identical , but the scaling functions themselves are different .",
    "the crossover phase diagram of the @xmath28 dilute bose gas is essentially identical to the fermion phase diagram in fig  [ fermifig ] , but the physical interpretation of the phases is somewhat different :    \\(a ) _ activated _ @xmath60 : this is essentially identical to the fermion case as the particles are dilute and their quantum statistics plays a negligible role .",
    "\\(b ) _ incipient superfluid _",
    "@xmath62 : the ground state is now a superfluid ( in @xmath64 a luttinger liquid ) , but classical thermal fluctuations destroy the long range order at any non - zero temperature . nevertheless , the phase coherence length is large and system behaves like a superfluid at short scales .",
    "\\(c ) _ quantum critical _ @xmath65 : this is similar to the fermion case in that @xmath6 is the most important energy scale . however , there are now strong interactions among the particles , leading to an incoherent excitation spectrum",
    ". the system does not display characteristics of a superfluid ground state at any length scale , but instead crosses over directly from free particle behavior at short time scales , to dissipative , relaxational dynamics at long time scales .",
    "the single particle green s function @xmath102 has a non - trivial scaling function @xmath103 ( this form actually holds in all three regions a , b , and c ) @xmath104 we have fourier transformed and analytically continued to the retarded green s function at real frequencies .",
    "this scaling form also holds for the spinless fermions of section  [ spinferm ] , but the scaling function then is simply the free fermion form @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a positive infinitesimal .",
    "computing @xmath103 , and other scaling functions , for bosonic quantum critical dynamics is not as easy .",
    "one approach  @xcite is to expand in powers of the fixed - point interaction @xmath101 which becomes small as @xmath34 approaches 2 from below : this becomes an expansion in @xmath107 .    in @xmath64",
    ", it is possible to make more explicit progress .",
    "it has been argued  @xcite that now @xmath108 .",
    "the bosons thence become impenetrable , and their quantum mechanics becomes identical to those of free fermions .",
    "hence , in @xmath64 , the quantum critical dynamics of dilute gases of spinless fermions and boson are described by the same cqft , @xmath59 of eqn ( [ cqft1 ] ) . for the bosonic system we have to supplement @xmath59 with the following non - local relationship between the boson and fermion operators ( essentially a continuum jordan - wigner transformation ) @xmath109 we are not home yet , as evaluating correlators of ( [ jw ] ) under ( [ cqft1 ] )",
    "is not easy .",
    "korepin and slavnov  @xcite have succeeded in showing how this problem may be reduced to determining the solution and fredholm determinant of a linear fredholm integral equation . at this stage ,",
    "numerical analysis is required , and some scaling functions have been determined to essentially arbitrary accuracy  @xcite .    finally , an additional comment about the @xmath110 case .",
    "there is now true superfluidity and a finite temperature phase transition to a normal state , all within region b. the remainder of the phase diagram remains the same as in the @xmath111 case .",
    "unlike the dilute fermi and bose gases , the ising model possesses anomalous exponents . yet",
    "it is simple enough in @xmath64 to allow exact computation of a quantum - critical dynamic correlation function .",
    "we will also review , in this section , the very useful and general mapping between the quantum model and an equivalent classical statistical mechanics model ; we will then discuss the crossovers in the phase diagram like fig  [ fermifig ] in the context of the classical model . some of of the following discussion is a review of well - known properties of the ising model  @xcite ; our main purpose here is to use the explicit solution in @xmath64 to present a physical interpretation which generalizes to other quantum phase transitions .",
    "we will explicitly discuss the following hamiltonian , describing the ising model in a transverse field in @xmath64 ( we will remark briefly on the generalization to higher @xmath34 ) : @xmath112 where @xmath113 in an overall energy scale , @xmath114 is a dimensionless coupling constant , and @xmath115 are pauli matrices on a chain of sites , @xmath33 . consider the ground states of @xmath116 for small and large @xmath1 in turn",
    ". for small @xmath1 , the second term in ( [ hamising ] ) dominates and the spins all align themselves either in the @xmath117 or @xmath118 directions : there is a spontaneous magnetization and spin - reversal symmetry is broken .",
    "on the other hand , for large @xmath1 , the first term in ( [ hamising ] ) prefers a state which is in a superposition of @xmath119 eigenstates , with different sites uncorrelated : the wavefunction looks like @xmath120 .",
    "these two limits are separated by a phase transition at @xmath121 ( in fact , @xmath122 , exactly , because of a self - duality property of ( [ hamising ] ) ) . in this section",
    ", we shall discuss the finite @xmath6 dynamic properties in the vicinity of @xmath3 .",
    "to begin , we recall the well - known fact  @xcite that the @xmath63 correlators of @xmath116 are similar to those in the classical , two - dimensional , ising model given by the partition function @xmath123 with @xmath124 where the sites @xmath125 now lie on a square lattice ( say ) .",
    "this classical model has a phase transition at @xmath126 . at the level of the critical continuum theories ,",
    "the mapping between the classical and quantum models become exact  @xcite .",
    "there is a simple relationship between the two - dimensional field theory , with classical degrees of freedom , describing @xmath127 in the vicinity of @xmath126 and the one - dimensional quantum field theory describing @xmath116 near @xmath3 : one simply identifies one of the spatial directions of the classical theory as an imaginary time , and then analytically continues the correlators to real time , to obtain observables of the quantum theory .",
    "this mapping leads immediately to some useful information .",
    "as the classical theory is spatially isotropic , the quantum theory has dynamic exponent @xmath128 .",
    "further , in the classical model the @xmath129 correlator behaves like @xmath130 in momentum space  @xcite ( @xmath131 is the two - dimensional momentum of the classical model ) ; analytically continuing this to real time , we obtain for the dynamic susceptibility @xmath132 ( this is the @xmath129 correlator of the quantum @xmath116 and @xmath83 is now a one - dimensional spatial momentum ) as a function of @xmath64 momentum @xmath83 and frequency @xmath84 : @xmath133 here @xmath134 and @xmath135 ( an excitation velocity ) are non - universal constants .",
    "we plot @xmath136 in fig  [ chiteq0fig ] .",
    "notice that there are no delta functions in the spectral density , indicating the absence of any well - defined quasiparticles .",
    "instead , we have a critical continuum of excitations .",
    "we can also compute the dynamic local susceptibility , @xmath137 a quantity often measured in neutron scattering experiments : @xmath138 this quantity is the density of states of local spin - flip excitations , and has a divergence as @xmath139 .",
    "our discussion so far has been at @xmath63 , and let us turn now to non - zero @xmath6 .",
    "a finite @xmath6 translates into a _",
    "finite size _",
    "@xmath140 for the classical model along imaginary time direction .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed along the finite direction , and so the classical model has the geometry of a cylinder with circumference @xmath140 .",
    "we now discuss the crossovers at finite @xmath6 in the context of the classical model . at @xmath141 ( @xmath63 )",
    "we can characterize the deviations from criticality by the correlation length latexmath:[$\\xi \\sim    energy scale latexmath:[$g=1/\\xi \\sim    display critical correlations characteristic of the point @xmath126 ; it is only at distances larger than @xmath143 that they become sensitive to the value of @xmath144 and display characteristics of the ordered ( for @xmath145 ) or the paramagnetic ( for @xmath146 ) phase .",
    "now consider the effect of a finite @xmath147 ; there are two distinct possibilities :    ( _ i _ ) @xmath148 ( for the quantum model , @xmath149 ) : moving from the shortest to largest length scales , the crossover from critical to non - critical ( either ordered or paramagnetic ) behavior still occurs at a scale @xmath150 ; the length scale @xmath147 has little effect at this point .",
    "the effects of @xmath147 only become apparent at larger scales , at which point it is permissible to use an effective model which characterizes the non - critical ground state .",
    "@xmath151 ( for the quantum model , @xmath152 ) : now the short - distance critical fluctuations see a finite size @xmath147 _ before _ they have had a chance to become sensitive to @xmath144 .",
    "these critical fluctuations are quenched by finite size effects in a universal way .",
    "the resulting non - critical theory then responds only weakly at the scale @xmath143 .",
    "note that the system does not display characteristics of the ordered or the paramagnetic state , of the @xmath153 system , at _ any _ length scale .",
    "the above arguments are summarized in figs  [ isingfig ] and  [ isingomegafig ] ; notice that fig  [ isingfig ] is quite similar to fig  [ fermifig ] .",
    "in all three regions of fig  [ isingfig ] , at the largest frequencies , @xmath84 , @xmath116 displays the critical correlations of the @xmath3 point as depicted in fig  [ isingomegafig ] ( we have returned now to the language of the quantum model @xmath116 ) .    in regions",
    "a and b there is a crossover from these critical fluctuations , at an energy scale @xmath14 , to the behavior of the ordered ( @xmath154 ) or paramagnetic ( @xmath155 ) ground state of @xmath116 ( see fig  [ isingomegafig ] ) .",
    "both ground states have a gap , and thermal fluctuations will lead to dilute gas of quasiparticle excitations .",
    "we expect that an effective classical model ( like glauber  @xcite dynamics , which is similar in spirit to the langevin models of hohenberg and halperin  @xcite ) will provide a suitable description of these thermal fluctuations . in @xmath64 , on the ordered side ( @xmath156 ) , these quasiparticle excitations are the ` kink ' and ` anti - kink ' solitons ; even an infinitesimal concentration of these is sufficient to destroy long - range order at any finite temperature .",
    "however , for @xmath157 , long - range order is not immediately destroyed : as a result there is finite temperature phase transition within region a where the magnetic moment disappears ; this transition will be in the universality class of the @xmath34-dimensional classical ising model  @xcite .    in the quantum - critical region c ,",
    "the critical fluctuations are quenched by thermal effects at the energy scale @xmath6 ( see fig  [ isingomegafig ] ; an early analysis of finite @xmath6 crossovers in the transverse - field ising model by suzuki  @xcite failed to identify region c ) .",
    "this quenching is completely universal and will be described explicitly below .",
    "the system has had no chance to display any characteristic of either non - critical ground state at any frequency scale . at low frequencies ,",
    "the system realizes a new quantum relaxational regime .",
    "it is this regime which is really characteristic of the region c , and not the high frequency critical behavior which is present in all three regions .",
    "it is in this sense that the name `` quantum - critical '' of region c is a misnomer .    as in the case of the dilute fermi and bose gases considered earlier ,",
    "the dynamic susceptibility @xmath158 will satisfy a universal scaling form over the regions of fig  [ isingfig ] : @xmath159 in the following we will determine the leading term in @xmath160 in the quantum - critical region c _",
    "i.e. _ we will present an exact expression for @xmath161 .    in the classical model @xmath127 at @xmath126 and @xmath141 , we know from ( [ chiteq0 ] ) that the green s function @xmath162 ; we are using the label @xmath8 for spatial direction corresponding to imaginary time .",
    "we can now use a remarkable result of cardy  @xcite , which relies on the conformal invariance of this critical theory , to obtain an exact result for @xmath14 in a system with a finite @xmath147 : @xmath163 this result has been asserted earlier by an inspection of the partial differential equation satisfied by @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "although results like ( [ gxt ] ) have been known to conformal field theorists for some time , they usually interchange the roles of @xmath7 and @xmath8 _ i.e. _ they consider systems of finite spatial length @xmath164 , and infinite temporal length , so that the system is in its ground state . for us ,",
    "the spatial extent is infinite , and there is a finite length @xmath147 along the @xmath8 direction , with the correlator ( [ gxt ] ) periodic in @xmath8 with period @xmath147 ( such a perspective has also been discussed by shankar  @xcite and by korepin _ et .",
    "@xcite ) . note that it does nt really make sense to talk about the long imaginary time limit , @xmath165 .",
    "however , after analytic continuation to real time , the long time limit of the quantum problem , @xmath166 or @xmath167 , is eminently sensible , and is precisely the new quantum relaxational regime that we wish to access .",
    "the analytic continuation is a little more convenient in fourier space : we fourier transform ( [ gxt ] ) to obtain @xmath168 at the matsubara frequencies @xmath169 and then analytically continue to real frequencies ( there are some interesting subtleties in the fourier transform to @xmath168 and its analytic structure in the complex @xmath84 plane , which are discussed elsewhere  @xcite ) .",
    "this gives us the universal function @xmath160 in the quantum - critical region : @xmath170 we show a plot of @xmath171 in fig  [ chifig ] .",
    "this result is the finite @xmath6 version of fig  [ chiteq0fig ] .",
    "notice that the sharp features of fig  [ chiteq0fig ] have been smoothed out on the scale @xmath6 , and there is non - zero absorption at all frequencies .",
    "we can also observe the crossover as a function of frequency claimed earlier in fig  [ isingomegafig ] .",
    "notice that for @xmath172 there is a well - defined peak in @xmath171 ( fig  [ chifig ] ) rather like the @xmath63 critical behavior of fig  [ chiteq0fig ] .",
    "however , for @xmath173 we cross - over to the quantum relaxational regime and the spectral density @xmath171 is similar to a lorentzian around @xmath174 . this relaxational behavior can be characterized by a relaxation rate @xmath175 defined as  @xcite @xmath176 ( this is motivated by the phenomenological relaxational form @xmath177 ) . from ( [ chiscale ] ) and ( [ phichi ] )",
    "we determine : @xmath178 where we have returned to physical units .",
    "the ease with which this result was obtained belies ( i claim ) its remarkable nature .",
    "notice that we are working in a closed hamiltonian system , evolving unitarily in time with the operator @xmath179 , from an initial density matrix given by the gibbs ensemble at a temperature @xmath6 .",
    "yet , we have obtained relaxational behavior at low frequencies , and determined an exact value for a dissipation constant .",
    "such behavior is more typically obtained in phenomenological models which couple the system to an external heat bath and postulate an equation of motion of the langevin type .",
    "notice also that @xmath180 in ( [ hamising ] ) is known to be integrable with an infinite number of conservation laws  @xcite . however , the conservation laws are associated with a mapping to a free fermion model and are highly non - local in our @xmath119 degrees of freedom ; they play essentially no role in our considerations , and do not preclude relaxational behavior in the @xmath119 variables .    for completeness we also present results on a related observable which shows the crossover from critical to quantum relaxation behavior .",
    "we consider the local susceptiblity @xmath181 , and obtain the finite @xmath6 form of ( [ chilteq0 ] ) by integrating ( [ phichi ] ) over momenta : @xmath182 a plot of the scaling function @xmath183 is shown in fig  [ chilocfig ] .",
    "the function has the asymptotic limits : @xmath184 the small @xmath185 behavior is relaxational as @xmath183 is linear in frequency , and the critical behavior at large frequencies agrees with ( [ chilteq0 ] ) .",
    "the study of this model is of direct experimental interest , as it is believed  @xcite to be a reasonable model of the spin fluctuations in antiferromagnetic compounds like @xmath186 and its lightly doped variants .",
    "the insight gained from the simple models studied in the previous sections will now be of great use , and we will rapidly be able to present a scaling analysis of its quantum phase transition .",
    "the hamiltonian of the quantum rotor model is @xmath187 where @xmath188 is an overall energy scale , @xmath189 is a dimensionless coupling constant , and @xmath33,@xmath190 are the sites of a two dimensional lattice ( @xmath35 denotes nearest neighbors ) .",
    "notice the similarity between the forms of @xmath191 and @xmath116 in ( [ hamising ] ) : it will turn out that the corresponding terms play a similar role . on each site @xmath33 of the lattice we have the 3-component vector operators @xmath192 , @xmath193 ( dropping the site index ) , which obey the commutation relations : @xmath194 = 0~~,~~[l_a , n_b ] = i \\epsilon_{abc } n_c~~,~~[l_a , l_b ] = i \\epsilon_{abc } l_c .\\ ] ] the vector @xmath193 is of unit length @xmath195 , and its orientation identifies direction of the local magnetic order ; the quantum rotor model is usually considered as an effective model for an underlying system of heisenberg spins  in this case the magnetic order can be any ordering which is specified by a single vector and has no spatially averaged magnetic moment .",
    "the simplest example of this is the two sublattice nel ordering , and we will therefore refer to @xmath196 as the nel order parameter .",
    "the @xmath192 operator measures the angular momentum , and as all phases have no net magnetic moment , we will always have @xmath197 .",
    "for further insight into the meaning of @xmath191 , consider the eigenstates of a single site hamiltonian @xmath198 .",
    "this describes a particle moving on a unit sphere with angular co - ordinate @xmath193 and kinetic energy @xmath199 .",
    "its eigenenergies are @xmath200 with degeneracy @xmath201 where @xmath202 .",
    "the ground state is a non - degenerate singlet ( @xmath203 ) and has maximum uncertainty in the orientation of @xmath193 . for large @xmath1",
    ", the ground state of @xmath191 can be approximated by the tensor product of @xmath204 states on each site .",
    "this state is clearly a quantum paramagnet and has a gap , @xmath205 , to all excitations .",
    "notice the similarity between this state and the large @xmath1 quantum paramagnet of the ising model @xmath116 ; in both cases the order parameters @xmath119 , @xmath193 are in a state of maximum uncertainty .",
    "the small @xmath1 limit of @xmath191 is also similar to the small @xmath1 limit of @xmath116 : now the exchange interactions between the sites prefer a state in which @xmath193 has the same definite orientation on each site .",
    "therefore , we expect long - range nel order in the small @xmath1 ground state . these two limiting states will be separated by a quantum phase transition at @xmath3 , which is , of course , the main subject of interest in this section .    before discussing the critical properties",
    ", we pause to remark on the relationship between the rotor model and heisenberg antiferromagnets . consider a pair of antiferromagnetically coupled spin-@xmath206 heisenberg spins : the eigenstates of this pair will have energies @xmath207 for @xmath208 .",
    "notice the similarity between these states and those of a single quantum rotor ; the only difference is that there is no upper limit on the maximum value of @xmath209 in the rotor case .",
    "however , it is reasonable to expect that these extra high energy states will not modify the low energy properties of lattice models .",
    "therefore , there is little reason to doubt that the critical properties of heisenberg antiferromagnets with a natural pairing of spins ( or more generally , a natural clustering into an even number of spins ) will be same as those of the rotor model .",
    "antiferromagnets with no such pairing contain net berry phase terms in their imaginary time path integral , beyond those present for the rotor model .",
    "however these berry phases cancel between the sites , except for `` hedgehog''-like spacetime singularities  @xcite , and it has been argued  @xcite that these remnant berry phases have no effect of the leading critical singularities .",
    "the reader is referred to the original papers for further discussion on these subtle issues  @xcite : we will restrict our discussion here to the much simpler rotor model @xmath191 .",
    "the critical properties and phase diagram of the @xmath30 rotor model @xmath191 turn out to be remarkably similar to those of the transverse field ising model @xmath116 of ( [ hamising ] ) in @xmath64 . like the @xmath64 ising model",
    ", the @xmath30 rotor model has no phase transition at any finite @xmath6 : so the phase diagram of fig  [ isingfig ] applies to @xmath210 , with no phase boundary in region a ( the phase diagram for @xmath191 in @xmath30 was obtained first by chakravarty _ et .",
    "@xcite ) . in both systems ,",
    "the @xmath63 , @xmath3 critical point has @xmath128 . in the case of @xmath116",
    "this critical point was described by a cqft which upon analytic continuation to imaginary time was the field theory of the two - dimensional classical ising model .",
    "the analogous mapping for @xmath191 yields the cqft associated with the field theory for the three - dimensional , classical , heisenberg ferromagnet .",
    "the universal scaling functions describing the crossovers in fig  [ isingfig ] and  [ isingomegafig ] have an identical form in both theories , although , because the critical field theories are different , the critical exponents , universal amplitude ratios , and scaling functions will have different numerical values .",
    "the explicit results presented in sec  [ isingsec ] for quantum - critical region c of the ising model , all apply , unchanged in form , to the region c of the @xmath30 rotor model : the qualitative features of the spectral functions in figs  [ chiteq0fig ] ,  [ chifig ] , and  [ chilocfig ] remain the same , and the relaxation rate @xmath175 ( defined in ( [ gammadef ] ) ) satisfies ( [ gammares ] ) but with a different universal numerical prefactor .",
    "however , unlike the @xmath64 ising model , we can not now get exact numerical results for the scaling functions of @xmath191 : this is because the three - dimensional classical hiesenberg ferromagnet is not exactly solvable ( unlike the two - dimensional classical ising model ) .",
    "instead we have to be satisfied by approximate methods ; reasonably accurate numerical estimates can be obtained in the @xmath211 expansion which has been discussed at length by chubukov , sachdev and ye  @xcite .",
    "there is a small , but significant , difference between the ising model in @xmath64 and the rotor model in @xmath30 which can not go unmentioned .",
    "this difference applies mainly to `` ordered '' regime in region a ( see figs  [ isingfig ] and  [ isingomegafig ] ) .",
    "the @xmath63 ground state of @xmath116 for @xmath154 has a gap , associate with the finite energy cost of creating a kink or anti - kink soliton .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath156 ground state of @xmath191 has gapless spin - wave excitations because of the broken continuous @xmath29 symmetry of the ordered state .",
    "so we can no longer use the gap , @xmath205 , as the energy scale , @xmath212 for measuring deviations from @xmath3 for @xmath213 .",
    "a convenient substitute turns out to be the spin stiffness @xmath214 which has the physical dimensions of energy in @xmath30 , and which also vanishes as @xmath215 . at finite @xmath6 in region a , it is known  @xcite that the spin correlation length @xmath216 as @xmath217 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the behavior of @xmath180 in @xmath64 is very similar : in this case the correlation length is determined by the mean spacing between kinks , and therefore behaves as @xmath218 for low @xmath6 in region a. ( related to the exponential divergence of the correlation length , there is a further sub - division of the `` ordered '' regime of region a ( figs  [ isingfig ] and  [ isingomegafig ] ) at the energy scale @xmath219 ; this complication occurs for both the @xmath30 rotor and the @xmath64 ising models , and has been discussed elsewhere  @xcite . )    associated with the continuous @xmath29 symmetry of @xmath191 , there is an important observable whose properties can not be deduced by an analogy with the the ising model .",
    "this is the uniform susceptibility @xmath220 , the response to a field , @xmath221 which couples to the global conserved charge associated with the continuous symmetry : @xmath222 the scaling dimension of @xmath220 can be determined exactly using symmetry arguments and the assumption of hyperscaling  @xcite : this yields the scaling form @xmath223 here @xmath135 , is the same velocity that appears in a @xmath63 correlator like ( [ chiteq0 ] ) , and @xmath224 is a fully universal function .",
    "this function was computed exactly  @xcite in a @xmath225 rotor model , along with @xmath211 corrections in some limits ; it has the limiting behavior @xmath226 + \\ldots & r \\rightarrow 0 \\\\",
    "\\displaystyle \\frac{2r}{n } + \\frac{n-2}{n } + \\ldots & r \\rightarrow \\infty \\end{array}\\right . \\label{chihres}\\ ] ] the two terms in the second result ( @xmath227 ) are expected to be exact to all orders in @xmath211 ; the same two terms were also obtained by hasenfratz and niedermayer  @xcite .",
    "notice from ( [ chihscale ] ) and ( [ chihres ] ) that @xmath220 has a linear dependence on @xmath6 both for @xmath228 and @xmath229 ; the slopes however differ by a factor of about 3 ( for @xmath230 ) and this will be important for experimental comparisons  @xcite .",
    "the most straightforward comparison is with the double - layer , spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet  @xcite .",
    "this model consists of spin-1/2 heisenberg spins on two adjacent square lattices , with an intralayer antiferromagnetic exchange @xmath231 and an interlayer antiferromagnetic exchange @xmath232 .",
    "the ratio @xmath233 acts much like the dimensionless coupling @xmath1 , with the large @xmath233 a gapped quantum paramagnet of singlet pairs of spins in opposite layers , and the small @xmath233 magnetically ordered .",
    "extensive numerical simulations have been carried out on this model by sandvik and collaborators  @xcite , and the critical point @xmath126 identified rather precisely .",
    "it is then possible to study the quantum - critical region c quite carefully as it extends over the maximum @xmath6 range .",
    "a number of universal amplitude ratios , including those associated with @xmath220 , and all results are now in good agreement with the @xmath211 expansion on the @xmath234 quantum rotor model . results from high temperature series expansions on the double - layer model also support this conclusion  @xcite .",
    "secondly , comparisons have been made with the single - layer , square lattice spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet , both via simulations and by experimental measurements on @xmath235 .",
    "this model has long - range order at @xmath63 , so must map onto the non - linear sigma model with @xmath156 .",
    "the low @xmath6 region a was studied in the paper of chakravarty , halperin and nelson  @xcite , with good experimental agreement .",
    "here we focus on the issue of whether this lattice model exhibits the cqft high @xmath6 behavior of region c , or it goes directly from region a to a non - universal , lattice dominated high @xmath6 region like d of fig  [ isingfig ] .",
    "it was first argued by chubukov and sachdev  @xcite that this model does indeed possess a significant intermediate temperature regime of region c : this was based on comparisons with the @xmath6 dependence of @xmath220 , with the factor of 3 alluded to above playing an important role .",
    "they also noted that it would be difficult to identify this region in the correlation length , an observation that was subsequently re - iterated by greven _",
    ". a rather convincing demonstration of the presence of region c was given recently by elstner _",
    "@xcite who examined a large number of observables in a high @xmath6 expansion , and found good consistency with the universal rotor model results .    also significant in this context have been nuclear magnetic resonance experiments of imai _ et .",
    "_  @xcite on @xmath186 .",
    "they have measured the @xmath6 dependence of the @xmath236 and @xmath237 relaxation rates at intermediate temperatures .",
    "their observations are in reasonable agreement with the predictions  @xcite that can be obtained from the universal scaling result for @xmath238 in the quantum - critical region c.",
    "this paper has presented a discussion of the vicinity of a second - order quantum phase transition in the context of a number of simple models . the overall picture that emerges",
    "is summarized in fig  [ generalfig ] , which shows a generic phase diagram in the plane of a coupling constant @xmath1 , and the temperature @xmath6 of a @xmath34-dimensional system ; this phase diagram is a generalization of a diagram obtained first by chakravarty _ et .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath30 quantum rotor model .",
    "the quantum phase transition occurs at the point @xmath3 , @xmath63 .",
    "associated with this critical point , we can define a continuum quantum field theory ( cqft ) over spacetime .",
    "in general , space ( @xmath7 ) and time ( @xmath8 ) do _ not _ play a similar role in the cqft and have different scaling dimensions : @xmath239 , @xmath240 under a spatial rescaling by @xmath241 , with @xmath10 the dynamic exponent .",
    "further , even in imaginary time , the action for the cqft can be complex due to the presence of berry phases , and therefore corresponds to a statistical mechanics model with complex weights .",
    "correlators of the cqft are the universal functions describing crossovers in the vicinity of @xmath3 , @xmath63 .",
    "the cqft has no ultraviolet cutoff , but is characterized solely by two energy scales : the temperature @xmath6 and an energy scale @xmath242 characterizing the deviation of the ground state from the critical point ( here @xmath13 is the correlation length exponent ) .",
    "the value of the ratio @xmath21 determines two distinct regions of the cqft shown in fig  [ generalfig ] . in both regions",
    "there is a high frequency regime ( @xmath243 ) which is dominated by excitations of the critical cqft of the @xmath3 , @xmath63 point .",
    "the regions are distinguished only by their low frequency behavior , which we discuss in turn :    ( _ i _ ) the low @xmath6 region ( @xmath244 , shown shaded in fig  [ generalfig ] ) is a region of `` conventional '' physics for frequency scales @xmath245 .",
    "this frequency regime can be understood by beginning with the non - critical ground state and examining the particle - like excitations above it . a simple classical model ( a boltzmann equation for a gas of quasiparticle excitations , or a langevin model of the types discussed by hohenberg and halperin  @xcite ) is usually adequate for describing the long - distance , long - time dynamics of these excitations .",
    "the shaded region can also contain thermally driven , phase transitions ; these transitions will be described by a classical field theory .",
    "( _ ii _ ) the high @xmath6 region of the cqft has a novel quantum relaxational regime .",
    "this regime is not described by an effective classical model , and displays intrinsic quantum - mechanical effects at the longest time and distance scales .",
    "a scaling analysis for this regime was reviewed in this paper . in some cases , as in the model of section  [ isingsec ] , it is possible to obtain an exact value for the relaxation constant .",
    "* quantum transitions between fermi liquids and states with various types of spin or charge density wave orderings were discussed in important early work by hertz  @xcite .",
    "he focussed on the immediate vicinity of the finite termperature transition , like that within region a in fig  [ isingfig ] .",
    "in particular , hertz missed the existence of the `` quantum - critical '' regime ( as was pointed out recently by millis  @xcite  this oversight is similar to suzuki s",
    "@xcite for the ising model ) , which has been the main focus of this paper .",
    "more detailed studies of quantum transitions involving fermi liquids have appeared recently  @xcite . a related , but different ,",
    "perspective is provided by studies of critical phenomena in rotor models with doped electrons  @xcite . *",
    "related ideas on scaling in the quantum critical region have been presented by tsvelik and collaborators  @xcite . *",
    "a great deal of work has been done recently on `` quantum impurity '' models  @xcite like the multi - channel kondo effect .",
    "these models also display quantum phase transitions , with crossovers bearing some similarity to those discussed here .",
    "however the transitions do not modify the bulk properties , and are related instead to boundary critical phenomena . * as we indicated briefly in the discussion on the bose gas in section  [ sec : bose ] , dangerously irrelevant operators sometimes need to be considered , as they do in the dilute bose gas for @xmath246 .",
    "in fact such effects arise somewhat more frequently than they do in classical critical phenomena , as the upper critical dimension of the quantum transition is often quite low .",
    "an early analysis of the dilute bose gas in @xmath247 by weichmann _ et .",
    "@xcite was dominated by such effects , although they did not present their results in the general context of quantum phase transitions .",
    "such a perspective can be found in more recent work  @xcite .",
    "* an important subject , on which much is not understood , is the effect of quenched randomness on quantum phase transitions .",
    "an early analysis for the random quantum rotor model was given by boyanovsky and cardy  @xcite .",
    "a recent exact solution by fisher  @xcite of the random transverse - field ising model in @xmath64 represents significant progress .",
    "the nature of spin glass ordering at @xmath63 and its destruction by quantum fluctuations has also been studied recently  @xcite . *",
    "a number of experiments  @xcite have reported scaling of the type in eqn ( [ phildef ] ) in the local dynamic susceptibility .",
    "however the universality classes controlling these systems are not understood and quenched randomness appears to play a significant role . nevertheless , it is interesting to note the qualitative similarity between the experimental measurements in fig .  4 of aronson _ et .",
    "al._@xcite and our result for the local susceptibility in fig  [ chilocfig ] .",
    "the latter measures spin correlations on a single ising spin induced via its coupling to its environment of other ising spins .",
    "however , there is a fundamental equivalence between the spin being measured and its environment ; this is an important difference between our bulk approach and alternative descriptions of the experiments using `` quantum impurity '' models  @xcite which clearly distinguish between the impurity and environment degrees of freedom . *",
    "a recent study  @xcite has examined the cqft of a quantum ferromagnet .",
    "this system does not display a quantum phase transition of the type discussed here .",
    "nevertheless , its phase diagram has regions similar to those in fig  [ generalfig ] and aspects of its scaling properties are related to those of the dilute bose gas of section  [ sec : bose ] .",
