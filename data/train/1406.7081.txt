    "the layered organic conductor @xmath0(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2 , an intensively investigated member of the ( bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2 family,@xcite recently enjoys renewed interest due to the presence of dirac cones in the low - energy band structure under high hydrostatic pressure ( above 15 kbar)@xcite or under uniaxial strain ( above 3 kbar along the @xmath3-axis).@xcite ( for reviews , see refs .  , , and ) .",
    "this material is a bulk crystal with a quasi - two - dimensional ( 2d ) character , as it consists of weakly coupled conductive bedt - ttf [ bis(ethylenedithio)-tetrathiafulvalene ] layers and insulating i@xmath4 anion layers .",
    "the existence of the gapless conical valleys at the fermi energy under sufficiently high hydrostatic pressure or uniaxial strain is testified by three experimental findings : ( i ) the conductivity parallel to the layers is roughly constant from room temperature down to about 2 k , while both the carrier density ( measured via the hall coefficient ) and the mobility change by almost six orders of magnitude in opposite directions.@xcite ( ii ) the conductivity perpendicular to the layers is greatly enhanced by a perpendicular magnetic field , and shows a complex dependence on the parallel magnetic field component.@xcite ( iii ) the shubnikov - de haas oscillations and the integer quantum hall effect have been observed recently.@xcite these observations have been interpreted in terms of spin- and valley - degenerate massless dirac fermions , assuming that only two exterior layers are hole - doped by the substrate .",
    "notice that none of the above observations are particularly sensitive to the geometry of the dirac cones ; both the density of states and the landau level spectrum are qualitatively identical for generic cones and upright isotropic ones , which naturally arise in the low - energy spectrum of graphene@xcite and on the surface of topological insulators.@xcite our knowledge of the geometric properties of the conical valleys in @xmath0(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2 mainly comes from theory , e.g. , tight - binding modeling of the highest occupied molecular orbitals at 3/4 filling,@xcite extended hubbard model calculations,@xcite and _ ab initio _ band structure calculations.@xcite on the other hand , theory also predicts@xcite a quadratic band maximum at the @xmath5 point of the first brillouin zone , and transport measurements by monteverde _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite have identified carrier densities @xmath6 @xmath7 ( electrons ) and @xmath8 @xmath7 ( holes ) in the linear and the quadratic pockets , respectively , which indicates an accidental overall hole - doping of their samples .",
    "the presence of a hole - doped quadratic band maximum is , at first glance , at odds with findings ( iii ) above,@xcite and difficult to reconcile with ( i ) , although the smaller mobility of the massive carriers may be important in this connection .",
    "hence we believe a discussion of properties that can in principle probe the presence of massive carriers is timely .",
    "recent theoretical surveys by mori@xcite have identified several other potential massless dirac materials among layered organic conductors . in some of them ,",
    "@xmath9(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2 , there might be a tiny gap.@xcite in other cases , e.g. ,",
    "@xmath10-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1khg(scn)@xmath11 , either the apex of the cones is far off the fermi energy , and the contact points give rise to electron - hole pockets due to overtilt if the contact points approach the fermi energy under pressure or strain , or exhibit charge - density - wave structures that are incompatible with the zero - gap property in the accessible range of the phase diagram.@xcite one material , @xmath10-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1nh@xmath11hg(scn)@xmath11 has no charge order and possesses dirac points that reach the fermi energy under pressure,@xcite but the linear bands become isotropic ( like in graphene ) , making it less interesting from the point of view of tilt - related electronic properties we are focusing on in this study .    here",
    ", we study the particle - hole and collective excitations of a continuum model of the quasi-2d electron gas in @xmath0(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2 in a magnetic field .",
    "the electronic coulomb interaction is taken into account within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "our continuum model includes both generic massless dirac valleys and a massive one , such as those that are expected in the vicinity of the fermi energy from the topmost two bands in @xmath0(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2 .",
    "we restrict our attention to the low - energy and low - momentum features of the density - density response , for which the structure of the highest two bands beyond these valleys is inessential . to be specific , we will use the band parameters of @xmath0(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2 under high pressure from the literature , and focus on the qualitative features that stem from the anisotropy and the tilt of the dirac cones and the presence of massive low - energy carriers .",
    "thus we extend the zero magnetic field analysis by nishine _",
    "et al._,@xcite who , neglecting the massive carriers , have found two plasmon modes , and interpreted the appearance of the second mode as a consequence of plasmon filtering.@xcite    our work generalizes analogous theoretical studies of plasmonic excitations in graphene.@xcite in graphene in a perpendicular magnetic field , apart from the upper hybrid mode ( uhm ) , which is the zero - field plasmon mode modified by the magnetic field,@xcite one can readily identify linear magnetoplasmons , which run parallel to the boundary that separates the intra- and interband excitations in the frequency - momentum plane .",
    "although the latter mode is essentially the coalescence of broadened interband excitations , its huge spectral weight justifies its identification as a distinct collective mode of massless dirac electrons .",
    "the uhm starts in the forbidden region at low momenta and merges into the linear magnetoplasmon mode in the interband particle - hole excitation region .",
    "we are particularly interested in the effects of the anisotropy and the tilt of the dirac cones , and include the massive holes to assess the relative importance of the two carrier types in the response .",
    "indeed , the valley degeneracy of the plasmonic modes and the uhm in the presence of a magnetic field is lifted due to the tilt of the dirac cones in opposite directions , in contrast to graphene , which has isotropic and upright dirac cones .",
    "most saliently , the coulomb coupling between the different uhms , which we investigate in the rpa , reveals a particular _ intervalley damping _ effect that we discuss in contrast to a single - valley approximation , where coulomb interaction is taken into account only within a single cone and the plasmonic excitations can be associated to a particular valley .",

    "<S> we study the collective modes of a low - energy continuum model of the quasi - two - dimensional electron liquid in a layer of the organic compound @xmath0(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2 in a perpendicular magnetic field . as testified by zero magnetic field transport experiments and </S>",
    "<S> _ ab initio _ theory , this material hosts both massless and massive low - energy carriers , the former being described by tilted and anisotropic dirac cones . the polarizability of these cones is anisotropic , and two sets of magnetoplasmon modes occur between any two cyclotron resonances . we show that the tilt of the cones causes a unique intervalley damping effect : the upper hybrid mode of one cone is damped by the particle - hole continuum of the other cone in generic directions . </S>",
    "<S> we analyse how the presence of massive carriers affects the response of the system , and demonstrate how doping can tune @xmath0(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2 between regimes of isotropic and anisotropic screening . </S>"
