    "as is well known , the sum of independent log - normal variable does not admit a closed - form density . and",
    "yet , there are countless applications in finance and actuarial mathematics where such sums play a crucial role , consider for instance the law of a black  scholes basket @xmath0 at time @xmath1 , i.e. the weighted average of @xmath2 geometric brownian motions .    as a consequence",
    ", there is a natural interest in approximations and expansions , see e.g.  @xcite and the references therein .",
    "this article contains a detailed investigation in small volatility and short time regimes .",
    "forthcoming work of a.  gulisashvili and p.  tankov deals with tail asymptotics .",
    "our methods are not restricted to the geometric brownian motion case : in principle , each black  scholes component could be replaced by the asset price in a stochastic volatility model , such as the the stein ",
    "stein model @xcite , with full correlation between all assets and their volatilities . in the end",
    ", explicit solutions only depend on the analytical tractability of a system of ordinary differential equations .",
    "if such tractability is not given , one can still proceed with numerical ode solvers .    as a matter of fact",
    ", our aim here is no too push the generality in which our methods work : one can and should expect involved answers in complicated models .",
    "rather , our main  and somewhat surprising ",
    "insight is that _ unexpected phenomena _ are already present in the _ simplest possible setting _ : to this end , our first focus will be on the case of @xmath3 independent black ",
    "scholes assets , without drift and correlation , with unit spot and unit volatility ) . to be more specific ,",
    "if @xmath4 denotes the fair value of an ( out - of - money ) call option on the basket @xmath0 struck at @xmath5 , one naturally expects , for a small maturity @xmath1 , @xmath6 and yet , while true for _ most _ strikes , it fails for @xmath7 ; in fact , @xmath8 to the best of our knowledge , and despite the seeming triviality of the situation ( two independent black  scholes assets ! ) , the existence of a `` special '' strike level @xmath9 , at which the value of a basket option ( here : butterfly spread ) has a `` special '' decay behavior , as maturity approaches , seems to be new . there are different proofs of this fact ; the most elementary argument ",
    "based on the analysis of a convolution integral  is given in section  [ sec : comp - based - saddle ] .",
    "however , this approach  while telling us _",
    "what _ happens  does not tell us _ how _ it happens .",
    "the main contribution of this note is precisely a good understanding of the latter .",
    "in fact , there is clear picture that comes with @xmath9 . for @xmath10 , and conditional on the option to expire on the money",
    ", there is a unique `` most likely '' path around which the underlying asset price process will concentrate as maturity approaches . for @xmath11 , however , this ceases to be true : there will be two distinct ( here : equally likely ) paths around which concentration occurs .",
    "what underlies this interpretation is that large deviation theory , which on a deep level underlies our methods , not only characterizes the probability of unlikely events ( such as expiration in - the - money , if presently out - of - the - money , as time to maturity goes to zero ) but also the mechanism via which these events can occur .",
    "such understanding was already crucial in previous works on baskets , starting with @xcite , aiming at quantification of basket ( implied vol ) skew relative to its components .",
    "as a matter of fact , the analysis in these paper relied on the statement that `` generically there is a unique arrival point [ of a unique energy minimizing path ] on the ( basket - strike ) arrival manifold '' .",
    "the situation , however , even in the black  scholes model , is more involved .",
    "and indeed , we shall establish existence of a critical strike @xmath9 , at which one sees the phase - transition from one to two energy minimizing , `` most likely '' , paths . and this information will have meaning to traders ( as long as they believe in a diffusion model as maturity approaches , which may or may not be a good idea  ) as it tells them the possible scenarios in which an out - of - the money basket option may still expire in the money .",
    "let us conclude this introduction with a few technical notes .",
    "we view the evolution of the basket price  even in the black - scholes model  as a stochastic volatility evolution model ; by which we mean @xmath12 ( as opposed to a local vol evolution where @xmath13 ) .",
    "this should explain why the methods developed in part i of @xcite for the analysis of stochastic volatility models ( then used in part ii , @xcite , to solve the concrete smile problem ( shape of the wings ) for the correlated stein ",
    "stein model ) , are also adequate for the analysis of baskets . in a sense , the present note may well be viewed as part iii in this sequence of papers .",
