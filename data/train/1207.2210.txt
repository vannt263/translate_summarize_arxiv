    "approximated to the second order in power of the inverse of the speed of light , @xmath3 , the relativistic dirac equation is reduced to the usual nonrelativistic schrdinger equation for the two - component spinor wave function with the three relativistic correction terms : the mass - velocity term , the darwin term , and the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) term.@xcite among them , soi induces many intriguing magnetic and electronic phenomena in condensed matter physics , such as the intrinsic spin hall effect@xcite and the rashba - bychkov effect ( simply , the rashba effect ) in two - dimensional ( 2d ) semiconductor heterostructures,@xcite and recently it is known as one of the main mechanisms of the generation of the robust metallic surface ( or edge ) states in topological insulators.@xcite these phenomena have been expected to open a new pathway to the spin - dependent electronics and the quantum computing , and thus soi in condensed matters has been of great interest both theoretically and experimentally.@xcite    so far , exploration of soi phenomena has been limited to materials with elements of high atomic numbers such as noble metals of pt and au , and @xmath0-orbital ( semi-)metals like sb , tl , pb , and bi . among them , au has the atomic soi strength , @xmath4 , of 0.35  ev for the @xmath5 level,@xcite attracting special interest due to the soi - induced rashba - type spin - splitting of the surface states in au(111 ) surface first observed by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy.@xcite such spin splitting was also observed in other clean ( semi-)metallic surfaces @xcite and surface alloys;@xcite however , the splitting was unresolvably small in another noble - metal ag surface@xcite although ag has the atomic soi strength , @xmath6 , of 0.13  ev for the @xmath7 level.@xcite    previous theoretical studies pointed out that the dissimilarity in au and ag is attributed to their differences in the intrinsic atomic soi strength@xcite and the degree of asymmetry of the wave function near the nucleus of surface atoms or , stated differently , the hybridization of different - parity orbitals in the surface - state wave functions.@xcite compared with ag , au has a distinguishing feature that the energy - level separation between @xmath5 and @xmath8 orbitals is rather small,@xcite which is related to the relativistic mass - velocity and darwin terms.@xcite this proximity of @xmath5- and @xmath8-orbital energy levels in au increases @xmath1-orbital character in the surface states,@xcite which is found important for the splitting.@xcite however , the role of @xmath1 orbitals in the splitting is still unknown except that they make the surface states asymmetric .    in our present work",
    ", we investigate the origin of the rashba - type splitting in the shockley surface states on au(111 ) and ag(111 ) surfaces , focusing on the role of @xmath1 orbitals . by turning on and off parts of the soi hamiltonian",
    ", we find that the splitting originates from interaction between @xmath1 orbitals via @xmath1-channel soi although the surface states are derived mainly from @xmath0 orbitals with only small @xmath1-orbital character , and the spin direction is also determined by the @xmath1-channel soi .",
    "the linear dependence of the splitting on the wave vector , @xmath2 , which is the hallmark of the rashba type , is found to be derived from @xmath2-linear dependence of @xmath9-orbital character of the surface states which exists even without soi .",
    "these results show that the small @xmath1-orbital character of the noble - metal surface states determines the rashba - type splitting while the large @xmath0-orbital one has weak and negative effects . as a way to modify the splitting by varying @xmath1-orbital character of the surface states , we consider electron and hole doping to the au(111 ) surface .",
    "our present calculations are based on _ ab initio _ density - functional methods,@xcite which employ a troullier - martins norm - conserving pseudopotential@xcite and the perdew - burke - ernzerhof - type generalized - gradient approximation for the exchange - correlation potential.@xcite wave functions are expanded with the localized pseudoatomic orbital bases.@xcite the soi term is incorporated within a fully relativistic @xmath10-dependent pseudopotential,@xcite and treated in the @xmath11-dependent fully - separable nonlocal form using additional kleinman - bylander projectors.@xcite in treating the soi hamiltonian , we consider non - self - consistently only the effect of atomic core potentials with the @xmath12 form , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the orbital and spin angular momentum operators , respectively .",
    "although we can also include contribution of self - consistent part of potentials to soi , our test calculations confirm that this contribution makes very little difference in the electronic band structures@xcite which is smaller than 10@xmath15  ev .",
    "thus , we do not include the contribution of the self - consistent part of the potentials to soi in our following calculations .    for surface calculations , we model au(111 ) and ag(111 ) surfaces with supercell including a slab of 30 atomic layers and a vacuum region of about 20  thickness , and we take 36@xmath1636@xmath161 monkhorst - pack special-@xmath2-point meshes in the full brillouin zone ( bz)@xcite to integrate the charge density .",
    "while ag(111 ) exhibits no surface reconstruction , the au(111 ) surface reportedly has a surface reconstruction of a 22@xmath17 unit cell , the `` herringbone reconstruction''.@xcite since this reconstruction has negligible effect on the electronic structures of the surface states,@xcite we safely take the clean - cut bulk atomic structures for au(111 ) and ag(111 ) surfaces.@xcite",
    "figures  1(a ) and ( b ) show our calculated band structures of ag(111 ) and au(111 ) surfaces , respectively . compared with corresponding experimental values,@xcite the maximum binding energies of our surface bands",
    "are 60  mev larger for ag(111 ) [ fig .",
    "1(a ) ] and 100  mev smaller for au(111 ) [ fig .",
    "1(b ) ] , consistent with previous all - electron calculations.@xcite the accuracy of the binding energy can be improved by careful description of decay of the wave functions into the vacuum,@xcite but we already have good accuracy for the rashba - type splitting .",
    "our surface bands show @xmath18  @xmath19 for the rashba splitting in @xmath2 space , defined by the offset by which the extremum of the surface - state dispersion shifts from the crossing point @xmath20 and @xmath21  mev for the rashba energy , defined by the energy difference between the crossing point and the maximum binding energy .",
    "when we fit our surface bands to an expression , @xmath22 , we obtain the electron effective mass @xmath23  @xmath24 , where @xmath24 is the electron bare mass , and the rashba parameter @xmath25 = 0.460  ev@xmath26 .",
    "these results are in good agreement with the reported experiments@xcite and theories.@xcite in addition , if we shift the surface bands to match the maximum binding energy with the experimental value , @xmath27 for au(111 ) , the calculated fermi wave vectors are 0.165 and 0.194  @xmath19 for the inner and outer fermi surfaces ( fss ) , respectively , which are also in good agreement with reported experimental and theoretical results.@xcite these results show that our kohn - sham ( ks ) hamiltonian , @xmath28 , which is the sum of the scalar relativistic part , @xmath29 , and the soi term , @xmath30 , describes the rashba - type splitting in au(111 ) surface accurately .",
    "in semiconductor devices , the relativistic response of electron spin to the electric field , @xmath31 , yields the @xmath2-linear rashba hamiltonian,@xcite @xmath32 , with the pauli matrices @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "these terms are derived from the microscopic soi hamiltonian @xmath35 and the nearly - free electron nature for 2d electron gases confined to surfaces or interfaces .",
    "while this model can explain the @xmath2-linear rashba splitting , it can not explain the correct size of splitting@xcite due to ignoring the effect of ion cores.@xcite    to find the origin of the rashba - type splitting , we consider orbital - angular - momentum ( @xmath11 ) decomposition of the soi term , i.e. , @xmath30 = @xmath36 + @xmath37 , and calculate the band structures with either @xmath36 or @xmath37 .",
    "this approach is possible because @xmath30 in our calculation is expressed as a sum of @xmath11-dependent kleinman - bylander - type projectors .",
    "figures  1(c ) and ( d ) show that when only the @xmath0-channel soi , i.e. , @xmath36 , is switched on , the band splitting of the surface states is reduced greatly , but when only the @xmath1-channel soi , i.e. , @xmath37 , is switched on , the splitting is even slightly larger than that for the full @xmath38 case .",
    "while @xmath39 in both cases are very close to the full @xmath38 case , the rashba parameter is @xmath40 = 0.118 ev@xmath26 in the former case and @xmath41 = 0.564 ev@xmath26 in the latter case , giving the following relation,@xcite @xmath42 this shows that the rashba - type splitting in au(111 ) surface originates from the @xmath1-channel soi while the @xmath0-channel soi slightly reduces the splitting",
    ".    in the above , we examined @xmath11 decomposition of the soi hamiltonian .",
    "now we consider orbital decomposition of the surface states on au(111 ) surface , i.e. , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the wave function of the @xmath45th surface band for the wave vector @xmath2 and @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are @xmath49- , @xmath0- , and @xmath1-orbital parts of the state , respectively . with this decomposition",
    ", we calculate the expectation values @xmath50 of the full @xmath38 for @xmath51 to analyze orbital contributions to the rashba - type splitting .",
    "we find that the @xmath1-@xmath1 soi energy , i.e. , @xmath52 , has opposite signs for the two bands , contributing most substantially to the band splitting .",
    "then , the @xmath0-@xmath1 soi energy , i.e. , @xmath53 , contributes to the splitting by about 10  % of the @xmath1-@xmath1 one .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath0-@xmath0 and @xmath49-@xmath0 soi energies contribute weakly and negatively to the band splitting , i.e. , they reduce the splitting slightly , and the @xmath49-@xmath49 and @xmath49-@xmath1 ones are almost zero .",
    "these results again show that the @xmath1-orbital character of the surface states determines the rashba - type splitting in au(111 ) surface although the surface states are mainly of @xmath0-orbital one .    to verify this picture for the difference in the rashba - type splitting in au(111 ) and ag(111 ) surfaces , we calculate the band structures without soi and estimate @xmath1-orbital characters in their surface states,@xcite similarly to the previous works.@xcite as shown in figs .",
    "2(a ) and ( b ) , the ag(111 ) surface states have negligible @xmath1-orbital part , but the au(111 ) surface states have relatively significant @xmath1-orbital one.@xcite this difference , due to the smaller energy separation between au @xmath5 and @xmath8 levels than that between ag @xmath7 and @xmath54 levels,@xcite confirms the importance of @xmath1 orbitals in the rashba - type splitting.@xcite    as a double check , we consider shift of the bulk @xmath1-band energies , that is , we modify the ks hamiltonian matrix by adding @xmath55 to its diagonal elements for @xmath1 orbitals after self - consistency , and then calculate the band structure .",
    "as shown in table i , with no shift ( @xmath56 ) , the au(111 ) surface bands are split by @xmath57 = 135  mev at the inner fermi wave vector , and the rashba splitting in @xmath2 space is @xmath18  @xmath19 , as mentioned above , and the ag(111 ) surface bands have almost zero energy splitting ( 3  mev ) . for au(111 ) , when @xmath580.5  ev , the energy splitting @xmath57 decreases to 92  mev and @xmath59 decreases to 0.009  @xmath19 and when @xmath601.0  ev , @xmath57 increases to 191  mev and @xmath59 increases to 0.019  @xmath19 . for ag(111 ) , when @xmath61  ev , @xmath57 increases to 48  mev and @xmath59 increases to 0.006  @xmath19 .",
    "these results show that the rashba - type splitting in noble metals indeed depends on @xmath1-band energies .",
    "we also note that @xmath61  ev makes the shifted @xmath1-band energy in ag close to the unshifted @xmath1-band energy in au , but the splitting in ag(111 ) is still smaller than that in au(111 ) due to the difference in the intrinsic atomic soi strength .",
    "c ... & & & + * au(111 ) & -0.5 & 92 & 0.009 + & 0.0 & 135 & 0.013 + & 0.5 & 172 & 0.016 + & 1.0 & 191 & 0.019 + * ag(111 ) & 0.0 & 3 & 0.000 + & 2.0 & 18 & 0.003 + & 4.0 & 39 & 0.006 + & 5.0 & 48 & 0.006 +    focusing back to au(111 ) , fig .",
    "2(b ) shows that the @xmath1-orbital part of the surface bands grows monotonously as @xmath2 increases from @xmath20 .",
    "this suggests that even the linear @xmath2 dependence of the rashba - type splitting may be determined by @xmath2-dependent size of the @xmath1-orbital character that exists without soi .",
    "thus , with more analysis , we find that only @xmath49 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 orbitals are significant for surface states along the @xmath65 axis , when the @xmath66 axis is the positive direction normal to the top surface . as shown in fig .",
    "2(c ) , @xmath63-orbital character increases from zero , as @xmath2 increases along the @xmath65 axis , while @xmath49- , @xmath62- , and @xmath64-orbital characters decrease slowly .",
    "considering the symmetry , surface states along different @xmath2 direction , i.e. , along the @xmath67 axis , have @xmath68 orbital significantly instead of @xmath63 .",
    "when we use @xmath69 and @xmath70 for @xmath63- and @xmath64-orbital parts of a surface state @xmath71 ( not including spin ) without soi , respectively , we obtain that the soi - induced energy splitting @xmath72 of the two surface bands is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is soi between up- and down - spin states .",
    "thus , the linearly @xmath2-dependent @xmath69 makes the rashba - type splitting @xmath72 proportional to @xmath75 . as soi splits the two surface bands , the @xmath63-orbital character increases in the higher - energy surface state while it decreases in the lower - energy one [ fig .",
    "soi redistributes @xmath1-orbital characters in the surface states but it does not mix the surface states with bulk states significantly .",
    "we note that even without soi , the @xmath63 and @xmath64 orbitals in the surface states along the @xmath65 axis form a nonzero @xmath76 component of the orbital angular momentum , which may be related to a recent study of the rashba splitting.@xcite",
    "another important feature of the rashba - type splitting is the helical spin structure . to find the role of @xmath1 orbitals in the spin structure , we calculate expectation values of the spin angular momentum ( sam ) operator .",
    "in addition , motivated by a recent work on the topological insulator,@xcite we also calculate the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) by projecting the surface - state wave functions onto a set of localized functions defined in a sphere centered at the top - surface au atom and then evaluating expectation values of oam operators around the atom using the projected wave functions.@xcite a half of the nearest neighbor distance , 1.44  , is used for the sphere radius , and real spherical harmonics multiplied by a constant radial part are used for the localized functions .    as shown in figs .",
    "3(a ) and ( b ) , obtained sam and oam of the surface states are in - plane and helical around circular fss . in our results",
    ", sam is mainly from @xmath62 orbital while oam is mainly from @xmath1 orbitals .",
    "when viewed from the vacuum side toward the top surface , sam is clockwise at the inner fs and counter - clockwise at the outer fs [ fig .",
    "3(a ) ] , which is consistent with the reported experiments@xcite and calculations.@xcite when viewed from the same side , oam from @xmath1 orbitals is clockwise at both fss while oam from @xmath62 orbital is counter - clockwise at the inner fs and clockwise at the outer fs [ fig .",
    "total oam is clockwise at both fss and has smaller magnitude than sam .",
    "these features for oam are also in good agreement with the recent experimental and theoretical reports,@xcite but are different from the @xmath0-orbital - based bi@xmath77se@xmath78 topological insulator where oam has opposite directions for the two surface bands and has larger amplitude than sam.@xcite    we also study the roles of @xmath0- and @xmath1-channel sois in determining the spin direction . as shown in figs .",
    "3(c ) and ( d ) , our result shows that when only the @xmath0-channel soi , i.e. , @xmath36 , is switched on , the spin direction is opposite to the full @xmath38 case given in fig .",
    "3(a ) , but when only the @xmath1-channel soi , i.e. , @xmath37 , is switched on , the spin direction is the same with the full @xmath38 case .",
    "this result shows again that the @xmath1-channel soi is indeed decisive in the rashba - type splitting while the @xmath0-channel soi has minor and opposite effects .",
    "as a way to change the rashba - type splitting in the noble - metal surface , we consider electron and hole doping , similarly to xe and na adsorption experiments.@xcite we performed self - consistent calculations with different numbers of electrons . in the undoped case , the surface - state wave function is asymmetric at the surface au atom , with greater amplitude in the vacuum side than in the bulk side [ fig .",
    "compared with this , electron ( hole ) doping makes the wave function less ( more ) asymmetric [ fig .",
    "4(a ) ] , resulting from decrease ( increase ) of the @xmath64-orbital character in the wave function due to change in the degree of the inversion symmetry breaking , affected by change of the potential near the surface . as shown in eq .  ,",
    "the rashba splitting @xmath72 in noble - metal surfaces depends on the size of @xmath64 orbital in the surface - state wave functions .",
    "thus , change in the @xmath1-orbital characters changes the energy splitting . for au ( 111 ) surface ,",
    "we obtain 40 mev decrease for 0.5 electron doping per surface au atom , and 10 mev increase for 0.5 hole doping [ fig .",
    "these changes are @xmath79100 times the rashba effect in semiconductor devices at electric fields corresponding to the doping concentrations .",
    "in conclusion , we investigated the rashba - type splitting in the shockley surface states on au(111 ) and ag(111 ) surfaces , based on first - principles calculations including soi .",
    "we showed that although the surface states have predominantly @xmath0-orbital character and only small @xmath1-orbital one , interaction between @xmath1-orbital parts via the @xmath1-channel soi produces the rashba - type splitting .",
    "the small @xmath9-orbital part of the surface states , present even without soi , depends linearly on @xmath2 so that the atomic soi results in the linearly @xmath2-dependent rashba - type splitting .",
    "the @xmath1-channel soi determines the helical spin structure of the surface states although the spins are mainly from @xmath0 orbitals .",
    "the @xmath0-channel soi has minor and opposite effects in au(111 ) surface .",
    "thus , the role of @xmath1 orbitals in au(111 ) surface has some similarity to graphene where small @xmath80 orbitals contribute dominantly to the soi - induced energy gap,@xcite but shows difference from @xmath0-orbital - based bi@xmath77se@xmath78-type topological insulators.@xcite as a way of varying the splitting size in au(111 ) surface , we discussed effects of electron and hole doping .",
