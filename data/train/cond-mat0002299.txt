    "understanding the statics and dynamics of elastic systems in a random environment is a longstanding problem with important applications for a host of experimental systems .",
    "such problems can be split into two broad categories : ( i ) propagating interfaces such as magnetic domain walls@xcite , fluid invasion in porous media @xcite or epitaxial growth @xcite ; ( ii ) periodic systems such as vortex lattices@xcite , charge density waves@xcite , or wigner crystals of electrons@xcite . in all these systems",
    "the basic physical ingredients are identical : the elastic forces tend to keep the structure ordered ( flat for an interface and periodic for lattices ) , whereas the impurities locally promote the wandering . from the competition between disorder and elasticity",
    "emerges a complicated energy landscape with many metastable states .",
    "this results in glassy properties such as hysteresis and history dependence of the static configuration . in the dynamics ,",
    "one expects of course this competition to have important consequences on the response of the system to an externally applied force",
    ".    to study the statics , the standard tools of statistical mechanics could be applied , leading to a good understanding of the physical properties .",
    "scaling arguments and simplified models showed that even in the limit of weak disorder , the equilibrium large scale properties of disordered elastic systems are governed by the presence of impurities .",
    "in particular , below four ( internal ) dimensions , displacements grow unboundedly@xcite with the distance , resulting in rough interfaces and loss of strict translational order in periodic structures@xcite . to go beyond simple scaling arguments and obtain a more detailed description of the system",
    "is rather difficult and at present only main two methods , each with its own shortcomings , have been developped .",
    "the first one is to perform a perturbative renormalization group calculation on the disorder , and is valid in @xmath10 dimensions to first order in @xmath11 . in this functional renormalization group ( frg )",
    "approach @xcite , the whole correlation function of the disorder is renormalized .",
    "the occurence of glassiness is signalled by a non - analyticity appearing at a finite lengtscale during the flow , specifically a cusp in the force correlator .",
    "this yields non trivial predictions for the roughness exponents of interfaces@xcite .",
    "another approach relies on the replica method to study either the mean field limit ( i.e large number of components ) or to perform a gaussian variational approximation of the physical model . using this variational approach both for manifolds @xcite and for periodic systems@xcite , correlation functions and thermodynamic properties",
    "could be obtained .",
    "it confirms the existence of glassy properties , with energy fluctuations growing as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a positive exponent . to obtain the glass phase in this method",
    ", one must break the replica symmetry . at a qualitative level , this is in good agreement with the physical intuition of such systems as being composed of many low lying metastable states separated by high barriers .",
    "as was clearly shown in the case of periodic manifolds , the correlation functions can be obtained by both the frg and variational approach and are found to be in very reasonable agreement , bridging the gap between the two methods @xcite . taken together , these two approaches thus provide a very coherent picture for the statics@xcite . in particular they allow to understand that although disorder leads to glassy features in both the manifold and the periodic systems , these two types of problems belong to quite different universality classes in other respects , such as the large distance behaviour of the correlations @xcite .",
    "these properties have drastic consequences for the dynamics of driven systems in the case , important in practice , where an elastic description holds ( i.e when plastic deformations can be neglected ) .",
    "determining the response to an externally applied force is not only an interesting theoretical question , but also one of the most important experimental issues . indeed in most systems",
    "the velocity @xmath1 versus force @xmath0 characteristics is directly measurable and is simply linked to the transport properties ( voltage - current for vortices , current - voltage for cdw and wigner crystals , velocity - applied magnetic field for magnetic domain walls ) . in the presence of disorder it is natural to expect that , at zero temperature , the system remains pinned and only polarizes under the action of a small applied force , i.e. moves until it locks on a local minimum of the tilted energy landscape . at larger drive , the system follows the force @xmath0 and acquires a non - zero asymptotic velocity @xmath1 . in the simplest cases ,",
    "the effect of disorder at large velocity is washed out and one recovers the viscous flow , as in the pure case . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", it is believed that there exists a threshold force @xmath14 separating both states , and that a dynamical transition occurs at @xmath14 called _ depinning _ , where the velocity is continuously switched on , like an order parameter of a second order transition in an equilibrium system@xcite , leading to a @xmath1@xmath0 characteristics such as the one shown in figure  [ vfinsp ] .",
    "an estimate of @xmath15 can be obtained via scaling arguments @xcite or with a criterion for the breakdown of the large velocity expansion@xcite . beyond @xmath15 , if one describes the depinning as a conventional dynamical critical phenomenon , the important quantities to determine are of course the depinning exponent @xmath16 giving the velocity @xmath17 and the dynamical exponent @xmath18 which relates space and time as @xmath19 .",
    "an even more challenging question , and experimentally at least as relevant , is the response at finite temperature @xmath2 . in the most naive description ,",
    "the system can now overcome barriers via thermal activation , leading to a thermally assisted flow @xcite and a linear response at small force of the form @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is some typical barrier .",
    "it was realized @xcite that because of the glassy nature of the static system , the motion is actually dominated by barriers which _ diverge _ as the drive @xmath0 goes to zero , and thus the flow formula with finite barriers is incorrect .",
    "well below the threshold critical force , the barriers are very high and thus the motion , usually called `` creep '' is extremely slow . scaling arguments , relying on strong assumptions such as the scaling of energy barriers and the use of statics properties to describe an out of equilibrium system , were used to infer the small @xmath0 response .",
    "this led to a non linear response , characteristic of the creep regime , of the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the roughening exponent for the static @xmath6-dimensional system .",
    "obtaining a detailed experimental confirmation of this behaviour is a non trivial feat , in reasons of the range in velocity required .",
    "although in vortex systems these highly non linear flux creep behaviours have been measured ubiquitously , it is rather difficult to obtain clean determination of the exponents , given the many regimes of lengthscales which characterize type ii superconductors @xcite .",
    "in some recent measurement , some agreement with the creep law in the bragg glass regime was obtained@xcite .",
    "probably the most conclusive evidence for the above law was obtained , not in vortex systems , but for magnetic interfaces . quite recently",
    "et al._@xcite successfully fitted the force - velocity characteristics of a magnetic domain wall driven on a random substrate by a stretched exponential form @xmath25 over _ eleven _ decades in velocity .",
    "this provided evidence not only of the stretched exponential behavior , but of the validity of the exponent as well .",
    "given the phenomelogical aspect of these predictions and the uncontrolled nature of the assumptions made , both for the creep and for the depinning , it is important to derive this behavior in a systematic way from the equation of motion .",
    "less tools are available than for the statics , and averages over disorder should be made using dynamical methods .",
    "fortunately , it is still possible to use a functional renormalization group ( frg ) approach for the dynamical problem .",
    "such an approach has been used at @xmath26 to study depinning @xcite .",
    "it allowed for a calculation of the depinning exponents , in @xmath27 .",
    "however this approach is still rather unsatisfactory .",
    "the frg flow used in @xcite is essentially the static one , the finite velocity being only invoked to remove - by hand - some ambiguities and to cutoff the flow , with no real controlled way to show that this is the correct procedure .",
    "furthermore in these approaches it is also necessary to assume , instead of deriving them from the frg , some scaling relations in order to obtain the exponents .",
    "another rather problematic point is that , with no additional input , the method of @xcite would yield three universality classes for the depinning : two universality classes depending on the nature of the disorder ( random bond versus random field ) for manifolds and one for periodic systems , while numerics and physical arguments @xcite suggested that only two ( random field and periodic ) universality classes could exists .",
    "in addition , since this is also intrinsically a @xmath26 ( and @xmath28 ) approach , it can not be used to tackle the creep behavior .",
    "we propose here a single theory for describing all the regimes of a moving elastic system , including depinning and the non - zero temperature regimes .",
    "our frg equations contain from the start the finite velocity and finite temperature .",
    "they thus allow to address questions which are beyond the reach of either approximate scaling theories , or @xmath28 frg flow .",
    "for the depinning we are able to determine the conditions required for the existence of a universal depinning behavior , as well as computing the depinning exponents ( and estimating @xmath15 ) .",
    "we show in particular that only two universality classes exist ( out of the three ) for the depinning since we explicitly find that random bond systems flow to the random field universality class .",
    "we can also extract from our equations the characteristic lengthscales of the depinning .",
    "the main advantage of our approach is of course to address the finite @xmath29 small @xmath1 regime as well .",
    "the method allows to _ derive _ the creep formula directly and thus allows to confirm the assumptions made on the scaling of the energy barriers .",
    "in addition we show that the creep is followed by a depinning - like regime and determine its characteristic lengthscales .",
    "a short account of some of these results was presented in ref .  .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ elasticitydisorder ] we present the equation of motion and the types of disorder studied here .",
    "section  [ preliminary ] is devoted to a brief review of scaling arguments and a summary of useful results from perturbation theory , presented in appendix  [ app : pt ] .",
    "section  [ fieldtheory ] contains the field theoretical formulation of the problem and the associated renormalization group flow equations , derived in appendix  [ app : derivation ] .",
    "the static case is studied in subsection  [ statics ] , focusing on the appearance of the cusp .",
    "the effect of the temperature is studied in details in appendices [ app : temperature ] and [ app : ftfp ] . in the next sections , we study the depinning ( [ depinning ] ) and creep ( [ creep ] ) regimes .",
    "both sections contain the outline of the derivation and a physical discussion .",
    "appendix  [ app : v ] is devoted to the effect of a small velocity on the frg .",
    "we conclude in section  [ conclusion ] , referring to an extension of our work proposed in appendix  [ app : n>1 ] . in appendix",
    "[ app : notations ] we fix the notations used throughout the paper .",
    "elastic systems are extended objects which `` prefer '' to be flat or well ordered .",
    "we are dealing with two different types of elastic systems which however can be treated in the same way .",
    "on the one hand , _ interfaces _ , i.e. surfaces with a stiffness that makes local distortions energetically expensive , on the other hand , _ lattices _ with elastic displacements allowed about a regularly ordered configuration .",
    "the first type is the easiest to visualize .",
    "the interface is assumed to have no overhangs and is thus described by a height function @xmath30 defined at each point @xmath31 ( see figure  [ interface ] ) .",
    "its energy is proportional to its area @xmath32 and in the elastic limit @xmath33 , reduces to @xmath34=\\int_{r } \\frac{c}{2}|\\nabla u|^{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] relative to the flat @xmath35 configuration ( notations are defined in the appendix  [ app : notations ] ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath36 the stiffness , or elastic constant .",
    "periodic structures , such as flux line lattices or charge density waves ( cdw ) , can be described by the same type of elastic hamiltonian .",
    "for each point ( or line ) in the elastic periodic system one can introduce a ( vector ) displacement field @xmath37 that gives the shift from the reference position @xmath38 ( see figure  [ interface ] ) .",
    "the elastic energy for small displacements is given by a quadratic form in the differences @xmath39 between neighboring points and thus can be written as ( [ elastic ] ) in a continuum description ( @xmath31 being a generic point in space ) . when @xmath40 has more than one component , @xmath36 should be understood as a tensor ( see appendix  [ app : n>1 ] ) .",
    "to take the quenched disorder into account in such systems it is necessary to express the energy of the above elastic structure in the presence of impurities .",
    "the coupling to a substrate or to local fields is easily written for interface models and is more subtle for lattices .",
    "quite generally the coupling to disorder leads to an energy : @xmath41 which gives rise to a pinning force @xmath42 acting on the displacement @xmath30 . depending on the microscopic origin of the disorder term @xmath43 , the coupling ( [ disorgeneral ] ) leads to quite different physics .    in the case of interfaces ( [ disorgeneral ] ) originates from @xmath44 in terms of the density @xmath45 .",
    "one then usually distinguishes two cases : either `` random bond '' ( rb ) when @xmath46 is short range ( random exchange for magnetic domain walls ) , or `` random field '' ( rf ) as discussed below , where @xmath46 has long range correlations .    in the case of periodic structures",
    ", the density @xmath47 can be expressed using the set of vectors @xmath48 of the reciprocal lattice and ( [ disorgeneral ] ) originates from @xmath49 where @xmath50 the average density@xcite .",
    "the potential @xmath51 is random , of short range @xmath52 ( e.g. point impurities for a vortex lattice or a cdw ) .",
    "we call this case `` random periodic '' ( rp ) .    in both cases , using ( [ hdisinterface],[rhointerface],[hdislattice],[rholattice ] ) and ( [ disorgeneral ] ) one obtains for the correlations of @xmath43 in ( [ disorgeneral ] ) @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a periodic function with the periodicity @xmath55 of the lattice in the periodic ( rp ) case@xcite .",
    "the @xmath56 function is cutoff at the microscopic scale @xmath52 .    for an interface",
    ", @xmath54 has the shape shown in figure  [ rbrfsketch ] . in that case , the width @xmath57 of @xmath54 is typically given by the width of the interface or the size of impurities .",
    "the force resulting from such a random bond disorder has correlations@xcite @xmath58 as shown in figure  [ rbrfsketch ] where @xmath59 the signature of such a rb disorder for the interface is that @xmath60 since @xmath61 decreases to zero at infinity .",
    "another type of disorder occurs in the case of interfaces separating two phases , like e.g. a domain wall in a disordered magnet .",
    "a random field couples differently to the two phases on the right and left of the interface , thus the energy resulting from the coupling to disorder involves an integral in the bulk of the system and not just _ at _ the interface position .",
    "the correlation of the force can still be expressed by ( [ delta ] ) and @xmath21 still decreases to zero above a scale @xmath57 as shown on figure  [ rbrfsketch ] .",
    "contrarily to the rb case , @xmath62 does not vanish .",
    "for a single component displacement field @xmath40 , the rf , of correlator ( [ delta ] ) , is still _ formally _ the derivative of a potential @xmath63 . the correlations of this fictious potential are of the form ( [ r ] ) with @xmath64 , and one has @xmath65 for @xmath66 which can be visualized as a random walk ( where @xmath40 plays the role of `` time '' and the _ random field strength _",
    "@xmath67 is the `` diffusion constant '' ) .",
    "contrarily to the rb for which @xmath68 is short range , @xmath68 for the rf grows at large @xmath40 as shown on figure  [ rbrfsketch ] .    in this paper",
    "we study the overdamped driven motion of such elastic systems which obey @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a friction , @xmath0 is the external driving force density and @xmath71 a langevin noise .",
    "the correlation @xmath72 defines as usual a temperature @xmath29 for this out of equilibrium system .",
    "the long time behavior of ( [ notcomoving ] ) at zero drive @xmath73 , reduces to the thermodynamics at temperature @xmath29 . in ( [ notcomoving ] )",
    "the bare@xcite pinning force @xmath74 is gaussian with zero average and correlator given by ( [ delta ] ) .",
    "we will consider three universality classes for @xmath75 corresponding to an interface in a random potential ( rb ) , in a random field ( rf ) or a periodic system in a random potential ( rp ) .",
    "physical realizations of such disorders would be respectively a random anisotropy for a magnetic domain wall @xcite , the random field ising systems @xcite and vortex lattices or cdw @xcite .",
    "it is also useful to rewrite ( [ notcomoving ] ) in the co - moving frame at average velocity @xmath76 . in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we switch to @xmath77 and thus study the following equation of motion @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the average pinning force and @xmath31 belongs to a @xmath6-dimensional internal space . from now on we specialize to an unidimensional displacement field @xmath30 as would be the case for an interface model or a single @xmath80 cdw .",
    "this simpler case already captures the main physics at small velocity , investigated here .",
    "extensions to many - component systems will be briefly discussed .    before giving a quantitative treatment using renormalization group ,",
    "let us review the qualitative arguments which have been given previously to describe the physics originating from ( [ notcomoving ] ) .",
    "in the absence of drive , ( [ notcomoving ] ) is equivalent to the equilibrium problem at temperature @xmath29 .",
    "the state of the system results from the competition between elasticity , pinning and thermal fluctuations .",
    "the physics of such problems can be investigated by a host of methods @xcite and here we only recall the salient points .",
    "temperature does not play an important role as will become clear and we begin with the @xmath26 case .",
    "a subsystem of size @xmath38 , with displacement @xmath81 , is submitted to a typical elastic force density @xmath82 and to a typical pinning force density @xmath83 .",
    "balancing these quantities , one obtains that elasticity wins at large scales for @xmath84 , resulting in a flat interface with a priori bounded displacements . in @xmath85 , systems of size @xmath38 smaller than the larkin length @xmath86 wander as predicted by the larkin model@xcite : @xmath87 at larger scales @xmath88 , the system wanders further than the correlation length @xmath57 of the disorder .",
    "this simple picture breaks down and the system can be viewed as made of larkin domains of size @xmath89 , which are independently pinned .",
    "first order perturbation theory confirms this picture below the larkin length . the static equilibrium ( equal - time ) correlation function at @xmath26 is ( see appendix  [ app : pt ] ) @xmath90 the wandering computed from ( [ unsurq4 ] ) @xmath91 for @xmath92 gives back ( [ larkinw ] ) , and we recover the scaling expression ( [ larkinlength ] ) by equating the wandering to @xmath93 : @xmath94 we used that @xmath95 for @xmath96 with @xmath97/16 \\sim s_{4}/\\epsilon $ ] when @xmath98 .",
    "the remarkable feature is that @xmath26 perturbation theory ( either using replicas or equilibrium dynamics ) gives that ( [ unsurq4 ] ) is exact _ to all orders _ @xcite in @xmath21 , and is identical to the correlation in the larkin model@xcite .",
    "indeed , the naive perturbation series organizes as if the pinning energy were simply expanded in @xmath40 ( thus the pinning force is independent of @xmath40 with @xmath99 ) , resulting in a gaussian model .",
    "in fact , due to the occurence of multiple minima beyond @xmath89 , this perturbative result is incorrect@xcite at large scale .",
    "it can be shown , for example on discrete systems , that if a configuration @xmath100 which minimizes @xmath101=\\int_{r}\\left[\\frac{c}{2 } ( \\nabla u_{r})^{2}+v ( r , u_{r})\\right]$ ] is defined on a volume larger than @xmath89 , then the hessian @xmath102 $ ] becomes singular @xcite .",
    "such instability appears clearly in a functional renormalization group ( frg ) treatment of the problem@xcite which proves that @xmath21 becomes nonanalytic beyond the length @xmath103 , as will be discussed below .",
    "it can also be seen within variational or mean - field treatments using replicas @xcite that replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) is necessary to describe the physics beyond the larkin length @xmath103 . using either replicas with rsb or the frg it is possible to describe the physics at all scales and to obtain the correct roughness exponent @xmath24 defined by @xmath104 where the value of @xmath105 depends on the statics universality class@xcite .",
    "since disorder induces unbounded displacements , the system is rough and the temperature is always formally irrelevant in @xmath106 .",
    "it is described by a @xmath26 fixed point , characteristic of a glass phase .",
    "an elastic system does not necessarily move under the action of a driving force .",
    "the disorder leads to the existence of a threshold force @xmath15 at @xmath26 as shown on figure  [ vfinsp ] .",
    "a simple dimensional estimate of @xmath15 can be obtained@xcite by computing the sum of the independent pinning forces acting on the larkin domains @xmath107 and balancing it with the driving force acting on the same volume @xmath108 .",
    "this gives @xmath109 another estimate of @xmath15 comes from the large velocity expansion @xcite of the equation of motion ( [ comoving ] ) ( from the criterion @xmath110 ) .",
    "it coincides with ( [ fclarkin ] ) .    for @xmath111",
    "the system moves with a small velocity , and it has been proposed@xcite that depinning can be described in the framework of standard critical phenomena , with the velocity as an order parameter .",
    "this leads to the assumption of two independent critical exponents@xcite @xmath112 and @xmath18 , defined through the correlation function in the comoving frame ( in the stationary state for @xmath113 ) @xmath114 @xmath115 for @xmath116 and @xmath117 for @xmath118 .",
    "the dynamical roughening exponent @xmath112 close to the threshold a priori differs from its equilibrium value @xmath24 .",
    "several related exponents can be also introduced such as : ( i ) the depinning exponent @xmath16 ; ( ii ) the correlation length exponent @xmath119 describing the divergence of the length @xmath120 defined from the equal - time velocity - velocity correlation function .",
    "they satisfy @xmath121 numerically@xcite the motion of the system looks like a deterministic succession of avalanches of size @xmath120 with characteristic time @xmath122 . from the argument @xmath123 and the statistical tilt symmetry@xcite ( see below ) , the exponents @xmath124 and @xmath125 are usually determined from @xmath126 by the scaling relations @xmath127    to obtain these exponents analytically , one needs to perform an frg analysis of the equation of motion .",
    "this will be discussed in more details in section  [ depinning ] .      at finite temperature @xmath2",
    ", motion occurs at any drive . for low temperatures and very small drive @xmath128",
    "one expects the motion to be very slow , and thus , although it is a dynamical problem , a qualitative understanding can be obtained by considering thermal activation over barriers determined from _ statics _ arguments .",
    "an original estimate@xcite of such barriers led to linear , albeit activated , response .",
    "however the effects linked to the glassy nature of the problem were understood at a qualitative level@xcite using scaling arguments .",
    "the argument proceed as follows : systems larger than @xmath89 have a ( static ) roughness @xmath129 and hence the energy has typical fluctuations of order @xmath130 with @xmath131 the energy scale of a larkin domain . assuming that the energy landscape is characterized by a _",
    "unique _ energy scale , and thus that the energy differences between neighbouring metastable states is the same as the energy barrier separating them as schematically shown in figure  [ landscape ] , one obtains that the barriers height scale with an exponent @xmath132 .    since the motion is very slow , it is usually argued that the effect of the drive is just to tilt the energy landscape , and the effective barrier becomes @xmath133 the maximum of ( [ barriertilt ] ) , obtained at @xmath134 , gives via arrhenius law the largest time spent in the valley by the thermally activated system and thus yields the velocity @xmath135 \\qquad \\mu=\\frac{d-2 + 2 \\zeta _ { \\rm eq}}{2-\\zeta _ { \\rm eq}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] known as the _ creep _ motion , characterized by the stretched exponential with exponent @xmath4 .",
    "note that the effective barrier given by the above formula vanishes at a scale @xmath136 which diverges as fast as @xmath137 , the typical size of a thermally activated excitation .",
    "this elegant scaling argument leading to the creep formula relies however on strong assumptions and does not yield any information on the detailed behavior , in particular on what happens after the thermal jumps .",
    "the fact that _ static _ barriers and valleys scale with the same exponent is already a non - trivial hypothesis about the structure of the infinite - dimensional energy landscape .",
    "refined simulations@xcite of a directed polymer @xmath138 in @xmath139 and @xmath140 are consistent with the `` equal scaling assumption '' for this particular case , but a general proof is still lacking . the second , and",
    "more delicate hypothesis is the validity of the arrhenius description : ( i ) the system being out of equilibrium , it is not clear that _ dynamical _ barriers can be determined purely from the statics ; ( ii ) one assumes that the motion is dominated by a _",
    "typical _ barrier .",
    "these assumptions can turn incorrect for some specific problems .",
    "for example , in the case of a point moving in a one - dimensional random potential , the @xmath1-@xmath0 characteristics at low drive is _ not _ @xcite of arrhenius type .",
    "although this @xmath141 case is peculiar since the particle has no freedom to pass aside impurities ( it is dominated at @xmath26 by the highest slope of the potential and at finite @xmath29 by the rare highest barriers ) , one should also address the question of the distribution of barriers in higher dimensions .",
    "let us now study the equation of motion ( [ comoving ] ) using a full frg treatment .",
    "this will enable us to describe the physics at all lengthscales and in particular the depinning and creep regime .",
    "a natural framework for computing perturbation theory in off - equilibrium systems is the dynamical formalism@xcite .",
    "after exponentiating the equation of motion ( [ notcomoving ] ) using a _ response field _",

    "furthermore the occurence of the asymptotic edwards wilkinson regime in ref .   has to be put by hand as a cut in the @xmath28 rg flow .",
    "the important correlation length @xmath7 ( denoted @xmath357 in ref .  ) at which this regime takes place is thus not well under control and has to be estimated from dimensional analysis . in our case",

    "our frg equations prompt for several remarks and questions . in the previous sections ,",
    "we have examined the consequences of the property ( [ rho ] ) and established in that case that the values of the exponents were the ones proposed in refs .  .",
    "although we consider it as unlikely , we have not been able to rule out the possibility that either @xmath366 ( or even worse , @xmath367 ) and thus we should examine the consequences of a violation of property ( [ rho ] ) .",
    "if @xmath368 , it is not excluded a priori that there exists another `` fixed point '' behavior ( e.g. with a scaling function of @xmath369 ) .",
    "however in that case , the exponents should differ from the standard ones ( unless some hidden and rather mysterious sum rule would fix the value of the integral in ( [ etaflow ] ) ) . in the absence of an identified fixed point , it is not clear whether universality would hold . again this crucial point ( [ rho ] ) can be definitely answered by an appropriate integration of ( [ flow ] )",
    ". thus the present approach , which clearly takes @xmath1 into account , identifies as ( [ rho ] ) the condition under which the trick used in refs .   gives the correct exponents .",
    "another intriguing point concerns the continuity between the @xmath28 and the @xmath260 problems . indeed , to derive the depinning law ( [ depinningresult ] ) we have assumed that @xmath345 remains finite as @xmath260 . however , we should recall that in the non - driven case ( @xmath28 and @xmath73 ) , @xmath370 diverges at @xmath240 and thus @xmath371@xcite .",
    "if there is any continuity in the rg flow as @xmath260 then @xmath372 in this limit . in that case the consequence would be ( see ( [ depinexp ] ) ) a modification of the exponent @xmath373 if @xmath374 ( or weaker logarithmic multiplicative corrections ) .",
    "we would then find for the depinning a different result from the conventional one .",

    "the question is of particular importance since , if really a finite - scale behavior , occuring near @xmath89 , would control the macroscopic asymptotic behavior , then again one could wonder whether universality would hold .",
    "therefore , the description of depinning in terms of a standard critical phenomenon may be risky .",
    "indeed as clearly appears in our frg approach , since the fixed point at @xmath28 is characterized by a _ whole function _",
    "@xmath323 ( i.e. an infinite number of marginal directions in @xmath376 ) rather than a single coupling constant ( as in usual critical phenomena ) the effect of an additional relevant perturbation , here the velocity , can be more complex due the feedback of @xmath1 itself on the shape of the function during the flow .",
    "this is particularly clear in the rb case which dynamically tranforms into rf .",
    "we now deal with the non - zero temperature case .",
    "the system can jump over any energy barrier and overcome the pinning forces , thus it _ moves _ with @xmath205 for any drive @xmath377 and never gets pinned .",
    "let us now show how our equations ( [ flow ] ) allow to investigate the _ creep _ regime that occurs when the system moves very slowly with @xmath378 , at low temperature .      as for the depinning , we are interested in infinitesimal velocities .",
    "the bare @xmath379 is thus very small .",
    "the main difference compared to section  [ depinninglaw ] is that the temperature is now finite as well .",
    "the main effect of @xmath29 is to round the cusp in the flow .",
    "since we are interested in extremely small velocities , we will consider @xmath380 as the smallest quantity to start with .",
    "a non - zero temperature gives thus rise to a new regime in the rg flow , where the rounding of the cusp is due to temperature and not to velocity .",
    "this leads to the following regimes in the frg flow shown on figure  [ scales ] .",
    "we will examine the various regimes in the rg flow keeping in mind that again , @xmath195 increases monotonically with @xmath189 .",
    "just as in the previous case , we expect a _ larkin regime _ for @xmath381 with small corrections . above @xmath354",
    "the disorder reaches a regime where scaling is imposed by the temperature . indeed",
    "since @xmath382 one can forget about the velocity and the frg equations are very similar to the @xmath28 and @xmath2 case . in appendix",
    "[ app : temperature ] we show that the temperature rounds the cusp on a boundary layer @xmath383 and we obtain the explicit scaling form ( [ scalingform ] ) @xmath384 which in the statics holds at all scales larger than a scale of order @xmath240 . here , because we focus on @xmath260 , the scanning scale @xmath385 is smaller than the width of the boundary layer , and the flow of the friction reads in this regime @xmath386 the temperature being irrelevant by power counting , the initial flow of @xmath236 is @xmath387 since the anomalous correction to @xmath236 vanish as @xmath388 . here and in the following",
    ", @xmath389 denotes the energy fluctuation exponent of the _ static _ problem .",
    "together with ( [ chi2surt ] ) it shows that the friction grows extremely fast , like @xmath390 .",
    "this is the _ thermal regime _ where motion only occurs via thermal activation over barriers .",
    "the velocity is so small that the center of mass motion is unimportant and the temperature essentially flows as in the @xmath28 problem .",
    "we have determined the flow in its initial stages , and we now determine the scale at which this behavior ceases to hold .    the flow equation ( [ etacorr ] ) for @xmath370 together with the scaling function ( [ scalingform2 ] ) for @xmath391 for @xmath392 shows that ( [ chi2surt ] ) holds only until the new scale @xmath393 defined as @xmath394 for @xmath395 the temperature remains the main source of rounding of the cusp .",
    "above that scale one must take the velocity into account .",
    "in fact , this simple picture is not complete since , before reaching @xmath396 another phenomenon occurs , leading to another lengthscale . in the thermal regime the correction to @xmath236 due to disorder competes with the simple exponential decay and ( [ ttheta ] ) breaks down .",
    "this physically expresses that motion in a disordered landscape generates a thermal noise ( provided some thermal noise is already present ) .",
    "using ( [ scalingform2 ] ) , one has @xmath397 at small @xmath194 .",
    "thus the correction to @xmath236 reverts at a scale @xmath398 such that @xmath399 . note that @xmath400 . above @xmath401",
    "the temperature does not decrease any more due to heating by motion .",
    "one can show using ( [ flow ] ) that @xmath236 saturates and does not vary much until the scale @xmath402 .",
    "we call this intermediate regime @xmath403 the _ saturation regime_. we checked it using a numerical integration of the flow in this regime with the scaling form of the disorder ( [ scalingform2 ] ) .",
    "analytically , if we suppose that after @xmath401 , the correction of @xmath236 due to disorder dominates @xmath404 , then one would have in this regime an invariant of the flow @xmath405 .",
    "if this were true , it is clear that the flow could _ never _ realize the condition @xmath406 , possibility that is excluded on physical basis and by the numerics shown in figure  [ tsat ] .    despite the saturation of the temperature , ( [ chi2surt ] )",
    "remains true after @xmath401 .",
    "thus the friction and @xmath407 keep on growing and one finally reaches the scale @xmath402 at which the scanning length @xmath408 crosses the boundary layer width @xmath259 .    above @xmath402 , a rigorous analytical analysis of ( [ flow ] ) becomes difficult .",
    "we however expect , since the velocity controls now the boundary layer , a regime similar to the depinning regime at @xmath26 to occur .",
    "using the same arguments than for the depinning , one obtains in that regime @xmath409 leading again to a decrease of the temperature , even slightly accelerated by a negative @xmath410 exponent .",
    "let us call @xmath411 the _ depinning scale _ at which one enters such a depinning regime . from the above discussion",
    "it is very reasonable to expect that one goes directly from the saturation to the depinning regime , i.e. @xmath412 . however we can not strictly rule out the possibility of an intermediate regime ( divergent @xmath413 when @xmath260 ) during which the correction to the friction goes smoothly from positive ( as in the thermal and saturation regimes ) to negative values ( depinning regime ) .",
    "again , it would be useful to settle this point through a numerical solution of our flow equations . note that in the rf and rp cases , the exponent @xmath188 and the fixed point @xmath275 in ( [ creepdep ] ) are the same as in the statics .",
    "however in the rb case , one have used a @xmath189-dependent @xmath188 which crosses over between @xmath414 for @xmath395 and @xmath343 for @xmath415 corresponding to the change from rb to rf fixed points @xmath275 .    in the depinning regime , motion",
    "now proceeds in a similar way than for the one studied in section  [ depinning ] . here again at large enough scale , velocity will wash out the disorder for @xmath416 with @xmath316 determined by @xmath417 .",
    "one then enters the edwards - wilkinson regime .",
    "let us now compute from the flow ( [ flow ] ) the lenghtscales defined above ( see figure  [ scales ] ) .",

    "we can now use the fact that at the scale @xmath304 , the disorder is essentially washed out and a perturbative calculation of @xmath436 is possible . solving backwards we determine @xmath435 , wich is simply @xmath437 where @xmath0 is the real force applied on the system and @xmath438 the bare friction .",
    "the correction to @xmath158 can not be neglected during the depinning regime , thus , using @xmath439 , @xmath440 and expressing @xmath441 one has @xmath442 in the thermal regime there is essentially no correction to the flow of @xmath158 .",
    "thus ( [ theflowf ] ) is controled by the depinning regime and one should integrate essentially between @xmath443 and @xmath304 .",
    "in fact due to the exponentially decreasing behavior of the integrand in ( [ theflowf ] ) the whole integral depends in fact only of the behavior _ at _ the scale @xmath443 . assuming that @xmath427 , using ( [ rc1],[r1 t ] )",
    ", one sees that @xmath444 for @xmath260 and thus one obtains @xmath445\\\\ \\mu = \\frac{d-2 + 2\\zeta _ { \\rm eq}}{2-\\zeta _ { \\rm eq}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the prefactor in front of the exponential can not be obtained reliably at this order .",
    "note that for the creep , contrarily to the depinning , the possible divergence of @xmath446 when @xmath260 ( and @xmath239 ) does not affect the argument of the exponential but only the prefactor .",
    "for the depinning it was possible to recover the depinning law using both the integration of the flow of @xmath158 and of the friction @xmath242 and the relation ( [ dvdfomrom ] ) .",
    "although one can also use in principle this method for the creep it gives poor results in this case .",
    "indeed contrarily to the derivation involving @xmath158 one needs here the flow of @xmath242 in _ all _ regimes including the depinning regime @xmath447 , where @xmath242 is still renormalized .",
    "since the renormalization of @xmath242 goes from large positive growth ( first like @xmath390 , then exponentially ) in the thermal / saturation regime to negative in the depinning regime ( where the system accelerates with subdiffusive @xmath448 ) a precise knowledge of the behavior around @xmath396 would be needed .",
    "unfortunately the lack of precise analytical methods available above @xmath449 prevents from computing precisely such a crossover .",

    "the product of ( [ etac1],[eta1t],[etadv ] ) is equal to @xmath454 .",
    "integrated from @xmath455 to @xmath1 , it yields @xmath456\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one would thus find , using the @xmath242 method a non - arrhenius law for the creep regime .",
    "even if one can not strictly speaking exclude this result , as discussed above it is most likely an artefact of the approximate integration of the flow , and only a lower bound of the barrier height .",
    "indeed compared to the integration of the flow of @xmath158 , this procedure is much more sensitive to the neglect of the crossover @xmath457 .",
    "a more precise integration of the flow would very likely show a compensation between the latent growth of the friction during the decrease of @xmath458 ( for @xmath457 ) and the reduction of the friction occuring in the depinning regime @xmath428 .",
    "note that if @xmath459 were equal to @xmath460 then , one would recover ( [ creepformula ] ) .",
    "it would be useful to check explicitely on a numerical integration of the flow that such a cancellation does occur and verify that the @xmath242 method confirms also the result ( [ creepformula ] ) .",
    "we also note that the precise determination of the lenghtscales for @xmath461 depend on obtaining an accurate solution of the rg flow equations . in the previous section ,",
    "we have obtained the formulas ( [ r1 t ] ) and ( [ rdv ] ) under some assumptions about the mathematical form of the solutions of the flow in the region where @xmath462 and @xmath463 cross .",
    "these assumptions , discussed in the previous section , should be checked further , e.g via numerical integration .",
    "although this should not affect the creep exponent derived above , the precise determination of these length scales is important to ascertain the exact value of the scale @xmath464 ( i.e the avalanche scale discussed below ) .",
    "since our flow equations ( [ flow ] ) include finite temperature and velocity , they allow for the first time to treat the regime of slow motion at finite temperature , directly from ( [ notcomoving ] ) . as for the depinning",
    "we derive directly from the equation of motion the force  velocity law and we obtain new physics .",
    "the first important result is of course the creep formula itself ( [ creepformula ] ) .",
    "our method allows to prove the main physical assumptions , reviewed in subsection  [ sccreep ] , needed for the phenomelogical estimate , namely : ( i ) the equal scaling of the barriers and the valleys ; ( ii ) the fact that velocity is dominated by activation over the barriers correctly described by an arrhenius law . in our derivation such law comes directly from the integration of the flow equations in the thermal regime ; ( iii ) the fact that one can use the static exponents in the calculation of the barriers .",
    "this appears directly in the formula ( [ creepformula ] ) but can also be seen from the fact that in the thermal regime the velocity can essentially be ignored in the flow equations .",
    "we also recover the characteristic lengthscale predicted by the phenomenological estimate .",
    "indeed one can identify the scale ( [ r2d2 ] , [ r1 t ] ) @xmath465 as the @xmath137 of subsection  [ sccreep ] .",
    "our equations allow to obtain additional physics in the very slow velocity regime .",
    "in particular , we see that the slow motion consists in two separate regimes . at small lengthscales",
    "@xmath466 the motion is controlled by thermal activation over barriers as would occur at @xmath28 .",
    "this is the regime described by the phenomenological theory of the creep .",
    "qualitatively , the main novel result obtained here is that the thermally activated regime is followed by a depinning regime , as shown by our equations .",
    "this leads to the following physical picture : at the length @xmath467 , bundles can depin through thermal activation .",
    "when they depin they start an avalanche like process , reminiscent of the @xmath26 depinning , up to a scale @xmath7 .",
    "the propagation of the avalanche proceeds on larger scales in a deterministic way .",
    "thus one is left with a depinning - like motion , and the size of the avalanches is determined by the natural cut of the rg ( @xmath468 ) , i.e. , the scale at which the propagating avalanche motion is overcome by the regular motion of the center of mass .",
    "one recovers qualitatively and quantitatively some features of the @xmath26 case at intermediate scale .",
    "the typical nucleus jumps over an energy barrier @xmath469 resulting in @xmath470 .",
    "this jump of a region of size @xmath449 initiates an avalanche spreading over a much larger size @xmath7 which we find to be ( see ( [ rc1],[r1t],[rdv ] ) ) @xmath471 with @xmath472 and @xmath473 the critical exponents of the depinning , and @xmath474 the energy exponent of the statics .",
    "note that the correlation length @xmath7 diverges at small drive and temperature as @xmath8 with @xmath475 and @xmath476 .    to push the analogy",
    "further one can consider that the avalanches at lengthscales @xmath477 are similar to the ones occuring in a regular @xmath26 depinning phenomenon due to an excess driving force @xmath478 . considering a minimal block size @xmath449 instead of @xmath89 for this `` creepy '' depinning , @xmath479 ,",
    "one obtains for this effective excess force : @xmath480 linking the creepy motion at @xmath2 and the threshold depinning at @xmath26 .",
    "as explained before , there might be an uncertainty in the value of the avalanche exponent , which could be changed by a quantity of @xmath481 . to confirm ( [ rvrcrtrc ] )",
    ", one would need to further check the precise behaviour of the solution of the rg equations for @xmath477 .",
    "one can understand qualitatively that the problem at scale @xmath461 looks like depinning according to ( [ eff ] ) .",
    "the tilted barrier ( see subsection  [ sccreep ] ) @xmath482 to be overcome in order to move a region of size @xmath38 ( all barriers corresponding to smaller scales having been eliminated ) , vanishes at@xcite @xmath483 . for the @xmath26 depinning problem",
    ", one can define a scale dependent effective threshold force @xmath484 such that @xmath485 ( also defined in subsection  [ statics ] ) , which corresponds to the force needed to depin scales larger than @xmath38 ( the true threshold @xmath486 being controlled in that case by the larkin length ) .",
    "a possible scaling derivation of ( [ eff ] ) is obtained by noting that at @xmath2 , _ non - activated _ motion at scale @xmath38 occurs when the tilted barrier @xmath487 is of the order of @xmath29 .",
    "this yields a @xmath29 dependent effective threshold force such that @xmath488 at @xmath489 , one has @xmath490 and ( [ ftcrff ] ) is identical to ( [ eff ] ) to zeroth order in @xmath341 ( i.e. @xmath348 ) .",
    "in fact , to apply the above static barrier argument , it might be better to work in the co - moving frame where the velocity of the interface vanishes .",
    "this amounts to replace @xmath0 by @xmath437 in the previous argument , and @xmath491 , @xmath492 gives back ( [ eff ] ) .",
    "the crossover between thermally activated processes and depinning - like motion can also be recovered by noting that the condition @xmath493 which appears in the frg flow can be rewritten as ( using ( [ tilde ] ) and ( [ lambdavtau ] ) ) : @xmath494 where the lhs is a natural energy scale involved in the depinning due to driving effect of the center of mass . if it is much larger than @xmath29 , depinning effects dominate , while if it is smaller , the dynamics is activated .",
    "finally many open questions still remain",
    ". technically it would be interesting to reconciliate the two methods based on @xmath242 and @xmath158 which proved to be equivalent for the study of depinning .",
    "in fact although the two methods should formally agree , the comparison at a given order in the rg is more subtle .",
    "indeed @xmath495 , by integration over @xmath189 between @xmath455 and @xmath496 and derivation with respect to @xmath1 , gives back @xmath497 provided that @xmath498 .",
    "however , one should notice that in @xmath495 , the derivative is understood at fixed parameters _ at the given scale_. the occurence of this hidden dependence in the velocity in the running parameters makes the equivalence between both approaches delicate .",
    "however the additional term is of higher order in disorder .",
    "thus , as pointed out above , it is very likely that a careful integration of the flow of @xmath242 should resolve this discrepancy , but this remains to be explicitely checked .    as for the @xmath26 depinning , the existence of the _ depinning regime _ at @xmath411 depends on the precise form of the boundary layer in the presence of a velocity .",
    "note that the alternative scenario discussed in section  [ open ] , e.g. whether or not the depinnig regime is universal , would not affect the creep exponents , but only the subleading corrections .",
    "we examine in this paper the dynamics of disordered elastic systems such as interfaces or periodic structures , driven by an external force .",
    "we take into account both the effect of a finite temperature and of a finite velocity to derive the general renormalization group equations describing such systems .",
    "we extract the main features of the analytical solution to these equations both in the case of the @xmath26 depinning ( shown on figure  [ vfinsp ] ) and in the `` creep '' regime ( small applied force @xmath0 and finite temperature ) .",
    "our rg equations , when properly analyzed , allow to recover the depinning law @xmath499 and the depinning exponent @xmath16 also obtained by other methods .",
    "however , contrarily to previous approaches that needed additional physical assumptions , such as scaling relations among exponents or by hand regularisation , our approach is self - contained , all quantities being derived directly from the equation of motion .",
    "it thus provides a coherent framework to solve the difficulties and ambiguities encountered in the previous analytical studies@xcite .",
    "in addition our method allows to establish the universality classes for driven systems .",
    "it shows _ explicitely _ that a random bond type disorder gives rise close to a random field critical behavior at the depinning .",
    "thus the dynamics is characterized by only two universality classes ( random field ( rf ) for interfaces and random periodic ( rp ) for periodic systems ) instead of three .",
    "since this phenomenon is an intrinsically dynamical one , it was out of the reach of the previous analytical approaches that used @xmath28 flow equations together with additional physical prescriptions using e.g. the velocity as a cutoff on the @xmath28 rg flow .    of course one of the great advantages of the present set of rg equations is to allow for the precise study of the small applied force regime at finite @xmath29 , for which up to now , only phenomenological scaling arguments could be given .",
    "our frg study confirms the existence of a creep law at small applied force @xmath500\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with a creep exponent related to the static ones @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the statics roughening exponent .",
    "it provides a framework to demonstrate , directly from the equation of motion , the main assumptions used in the phenomenological scaling derivation of the creep namely : ( i ) the existence of a single scaling for both the barriers and the minima of the energy landscape of the disordered system ; ( ii ) the fact that the motion is characterized by an activation ( arrhenius ) law over a typical barrier .    in addition , our study unveils a novel `` depinning - like regime '' within the creep phenomena , not addressed previously , even at the qualitative level since the phenomenological creep arguments did not address what happens _ after _",
    "the thermally activated jump of the optimal nucleus .",
    "although the velocity is dominated by the time spent to thermally jump over the barriers , our equations show that the small @xmath0 behavior consists in fact of _ two different regimes_. up to a size @xmath467 motion can only occur through thermal activation over barriers .",
    "this is the regime described by the phenomenological approach to the creep .",
    "the optimal nucleus of the scaling estimate is given directly by the rg derivation as @xmath501 .",
    "remarkably , another interesting regime exists above this lenghtscale ( see figure  [ dessin ] ) .",
    "it emerges directly from our rg equations and can be given the following simple physical interpretation . in some regions of the system , bundles of size @xmath467 depin due to thermal activation .",
    "these small events then trigger much larger ones , and the motion above @xmath467 proceeds in a _ deterministic way _ , much as the @xmath26 depinning . in particular once the initial bundle depins it triggers an avalanche up to a size @xmath464 which is given by @xmath502 where @xmath13 , @xmath16 and @xmath125 are the energy , depinning and correlation length exponents respectively .",
    "the present study also raises several interesting questions which deserve further investigation , some of them rely on being able to obtain a more accurate solution of our flow equations .",
    "we have shown explicitly how to recover from our equations the conventional depinning law ( and the scaling creep exponents ) .",
    "it rested on a mathematical property , likely to hold , but not yet rigorously established , of the solution for the flow of the correlator of the disorder .",
    "such behavior should be checked in details .",
    "the equations being quite complicated , a numerical solution , albeit delicate , seems to be appropriate .",
    "if the constraint ( [ rho ] ) on the flow defined in section  [ depinningdiscussion ] were found to be violated , then the conventional picture of the depinning would very likely fail , as we have analyzed in detail .",
    "a similar question arises concerning the flow of the friction @xmath242 as discussed in section  [ creepdiscussion ] .",
    "if the solution of the flow is found to depend on the precise behavior at the larkin length @xmath103 , it is likely that even universality could be questioned .",
    "these issues are a priori less important for the first , thermally activated , part of the creep regime , but because of the existence of a second , depinning - like regime , they would also have consequences for creep . again , these question depend on the precise form of the flow and can be answered unambiguously by a detailed enough analysis of our equations .",
    "it would also be of great interest to develop a more detailed physical picture of the crossover between thermally activated and depinning like motion since we found that both occur within the creep phenomenon .",
    "several applications and extensions of our work can be envisioned .",
    "first , extensions to many - dimensional displacement field ( of dimension @xmath503 ) , given in appendix  [ app : n>1 ] , would be interesting to study within the methods used here .",
    "one could check whether the approximation used in ref .   yields the correct result for the @xmath503 depinning .",
    "second , the effect of additional kpz non - linearities could be investigated .",
    "in particular one could check the usual argument which yields that kpz terms are unimportant for the depinning@xcite since their coupling constant is proportionnal to the ( small ) velocity .",
    "also , extensions to other types of disorder , such as correlated disorder@xcite are possible .",
    "finally , it should allow to describe in a systematic way the the thermal rounding of the depinning , i.e. the study of the @xmath1@xmath0 characteristics for @xmath0 close to the threshold and small @xmath29 .",
    "if one assumes that one can simply carry naive perturbation theory in @xmath29 around the @xmath26 solution of the rg flow near @xmath15 ( i.e. only keeping the contribution beyond @xmath304 ) , one is led in ( [ f - fc ] ) to an additional term proportional to @xmath504 , which readily yields the value for the thermal rounding exponent @xmath505 proposed in ref .",
    "( i.e. a scaling form near @xmath506 and small @xmath29 for the velocity @xmath507 ) .",
    "although this exponent seems to be consistent with starting values @xmath508 , its validity could be further checked by solving our rg flow equations at small @xmath29 .",

    "the @xmath805 term in ( [ flow ] ) is written under a form involving two integrations over @xmath298 , reflecting the presence of two response functions integrated over time .",
    "after some integrations by part , the @xmath805 term becomes@xcite @xmath806 integrated over @xmath40 , this correction becomes @xmath807 for any non - crazy function @xmath21 , this expression is positive .",
    "assuming that @xmath75 has no cusp , it can be safely expanded and we can check that it is of order @xmath808 : @xmath809 thus at @xmath810 , the integral of @xmath811 _ grows _ during the flow , whereas it was _ conserved _ in the statics .    using ( [ oneint ] ) , one can also compare the flow of @xmath269 at small velocity to the cuspy @xmath28 flow .",
    "in particular , one observes that the effect of the velocity is to reduce the blow - up of the curvature @xmath270 @xmath812 ( note that @xmath813 whereas @xmath814 ) .",
    "the flow of the friction is similarly slowed down : @xmath815    the term @xmath276 in the @xmath28 flow of @xmath277 in ( [ deltav0 ] ) at @xmath28 is replaced at @xmath205 by @xmath816 which has the right sign ( using cauchy inequality ) to slow down the exponential growth of @xmath817 .",
    "obtaining a numerical integration of the flow is a highly non - trivial quest@xcite , since all the interesting properties occur close to the origin yielding unaccurate results in real space . in fourier space ,",
    "the number of harmonics to be retained is huge if one wants to focus on the quasi - cuspy behavior ( @xmath818 at the cuspy fixed point ) .",
    "however , we obtained , at least at the beginning of the flow ( up to @xmath240 ) with small initial velocity , the curve shown in figure  [ rbrfpic ] .",
    "the initial condition was a rb disorder ( full line ) .",
    "it is obvious on the snapshot ( dotted line ) close to @xmath240 that the flow transformed the rb into a rf .",
    "we show here that at the scale @xmath240 , @xmath255 is very close to the static zero - temperature fixed point @xmath819 .",
    "this can be checked numerically , even in the presence of a small temperature and small velocity .",
    "analytically , one can not obtain an exact integration of the flow , but we can compare @xmath255 to the known @xmath819 by the following arguments .",
    "let us take e.g. the rf case for which @xmath343",
    ". for weak disorder one obtains from the integration of ( [ closed ] ) : @xmath820 where we have used @xmath821 .",
    "we prove in appendix  [ rft ] that @xmath822 verifies @xmath823 and that @xmath824 .",
    "thus the range @xmath825 of @xmath287 verifies @xmath826 to determine the range of @xmath827 we use the fact that at the beginning of the flow one can neglect the non - linear term in the flow equation ( [ flow ] ) .",
    "we are left with @xmath828 and thus the range of @xmath829 is simply @xmath830 a comparison of ( [ chirfrf ] ) and ( [ rangelc ] ) shows that the two ranges are similar .",
    "furthermore , in the rf case @xmath230 is conserved by the flow at @xmath28 , and thus the similarity of ranges shows that the shape of @xmath831 is close to the shape of @xmath287 ( same integral , same range ) .                                                              note that for periodic structures we consider in this paper for simplicity only the case @xmath835 and thus the intermediate random manifold regime is absent@xcite .",
    "the method can be straightforwardly extended to the general case .",
    "note that although the initial problem does not distinguish between internal ( @xmath836 ) and height ( @xmath837 ) directions , an asymmetry occurs during the coarse - graining and it is useful to consider ( [ delta ] ) as a general starting point .",
    "the large @xmath1 limit is simple only for the single component model when setting the internal space cutoff to zero . more generally , in this far from equilibrium regime",
    ", other effects can become important , such as the generation of non - linear kpz type terms , or for periodic structures , effects related to the existence of a moving glass , as discussed elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the divergence of the friction in the dynamical study of the statics ( @xmath73 , @xmath28 ) does not quantitatively feedback on the static observables but provides the qualitative information that the system is pinned in the sense that an infinite time is needed to escape the metastable states .",
    "the scale @xmath838 in the frg , corresponding to the onset of depinning - like motion , is naturally identified with @xmath839 , and the frg relation @xmath840 compares with the scaling relation @xmath841 ."
