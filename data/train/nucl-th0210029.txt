    "new experimental facilities , planned in the near future @xcite , will be able to make detailed measurement of open charm production in @xmath4- , @xmath5- or @xmath6-collisions , in a wide energy region , starting from threshold .",
    "one can expect that the physics of close - to - threshold @xmath7-production is similar to @xmath1-production .",
    "last precise experiments about strange particle production in @xmath8-collisions gave interesting information about the possible reaction mechanism @xcite .",
    "for example , the relative value of the total cross sections for @xmath1 and @xmath9-production , and in particular the large and negative polarization transfer coefficient @xmath10 ( from the polarized proton beam to the produced @xmath11-hyperon ) can be considered a strong indication of @xmath12-meson exchange as the main reaction mechanism - in this energy region .",
    "the final @xmath13-interaction strongly affects the different polarization observables , suggesting a sensitive method for the determination of low - energy parameters of the @xmath13 or @xmath14-interaction .",
    "such information is useful for the determination of the @xmath13 and @xmath14-potential and therefore for predictions of the properties of hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "the existing data about @xmath15 , in the near threshold region , do not exclude a contribution of @xmath16-exchange , in particular in the case of @xmath17-production , where the @xmath12-exchange is depressed by a smaller @xmath18-coupling constant ( following @xmath19-symmetry one finds @xmath20 ) .",
    "the experience gained in the theoretical and experimental study of strange particles can be extrapolated to the case of the processes @xmath0 , in the threshold region .",
    "no experimental data exist here : the lowest energy , where open charm production has been detected in @xmath21collisions is @xmath22=70 gev ( @xmath23=11 gev ) @xcite .",
    "the experimental activity is focussed on qcd - inspired approaches , mainly for inclusive charm production , which can not be easily extrapolated to the threshold region . in a more traditional way , the process",
    "@xmath24 has been considered twenty years ago , in the framework of one - pion exchange model @xcite , using a specific approach , for the calculation of the amplitudes for such elementary subprocess , as @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",
    "this approach is based on the quark - gluon - string model , which can be considered as the non - perturbative topological equivalent of the corresponding regge phenomenology .",
    "note that , in such approach , the spin structure of the amplitudes for @xmath27-process is ignored , and in principle , it is crucial for a correct calculation in the near threshold region .",
    "moreover , a number of parameters is necessary for such calculations , concerning , in particular , the @xmath28-regge trajectory .",
    "the understanding of elementary open charm production processes in @xmath29 or @xmath30-collisions is a very actual problem , in connection with leptonic pair production in @xmath31-collisions @xcite at sps .",
    "the intensive charm production in secondary @xmath29-collisions @xcite can be considered an important source of leptonic pairs in the intermediate mass region @xcite .",
    "for a reliable description of the overall charm dynamics of @xmath6-collisions , it is necessary to have a good parametrization of the elementary processes of open charm production in @xmath29 and @xmath30-collisions .",
    "the parametrization of the energy behavior of the total cross section for different processes of @xmath32 and @xmath33-production for @xmath34 10 gev generally used in simulation codes , can not be applied near threshold as it violates the general threshold behavior for two- or three - particle production .",
    "we completely agree on the explicit statement of ref .",
    "@xcite: _ we have to point out that our parametrizations for the differential and total cross sections for open charm ( as well as charmonia ) become questionable at low energy , but also at high energy .",
    "it is thus mandatory that they have to be controlled by experimental data from @xmath8 , @xmath35 and @xmath29 reactions before reliable conclusions on open charm dynamics in nucleus - nucleus reactions can be drawn._    in this paper we analyze the @xmath0-processes , in the near threshold region , taking rigorously into account the spin and isospin structure of the corresponding matrix elements . in our analysis , we follow a very close analogy between open charm and open strangeness production in nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "according to the @xmath36-symmetry ( which gives useful relations for meson - baryon coupling constants , such as @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) , one can expect that namely the @xmath32-exchange is important for the processes @xmath0 in the near threshold region .",
    "the amplitude for such mechanism can be predicted , being driven by elastic @xmath39-scattering ( at zero energy ) , in analogy to elastic @xmath40-scattering , with real scattering lengths .",
    "the possible @xmath16-exchange - involving the elementary subprocess @xmath41 , seems more complicated and difficult to estimate ( in model independent way ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we establish the spin and isospin structure of the threshold matrix elements for the processes @xmath0 .",
    "the calculation of the threshold partial amplitudes for @xmath42-production in the framework of @xmath33-exchange is done in section iii .",
    "the estimation of the energy dependence of the total cross section is done in section iv .",
    "the strong correlation between the spin and isospin structures of the threshold matrix element for the @xmath0 reactions is an important characteristic of the threshold @xmath30-dynamics .",
    "first of all , this correlation causes the absence of factorization of spin and isospin variables , which is typical for the majority of hadronic processes ( see @xmath29-scattering , for example ) .",
    "factorization means that we can consider the spin structure of the matrix elements independently from its isospin structure .",
    "moreover , all possible spin structures , which are allowed by the symmetry properties of the strong interaction for the considered matrix element , contain , in general , all possible isospin structures .",
    "it is not the case for the threshold matrix element of the @xmath0-processes , where there is a strong and not trivial connection of the spin and isospin variables . as a result ,",
    "different spin amplitudes have different isotopic structures .    using the isotopic invariance of the strong interaction and taking into account that @xmath43 , @xmath44 , one can find for @xmath45 : @xmath46 where @xmath47 are the isotopic amplitudes , corresponding to the total isospin @xmath48 for the initial nucleons and the total isospin @xmath49 for the produced @xmath39-system .",
    "one can see , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : amp ] ) , that seven different matrix elements for @xmath45 , are characterized by three complex isotopic amplitudes : @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 . therefore , in the general case",
    ", taking into account the possible interference between these amplitudes , one can find the following relation between the differential cross sections : @xmath53 @xmath54 , \\label{eq : sig}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the phase space element for three - particle final state .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : sig ] ) holds in any kinematical condition and for any reaction mechanism .",
    "the situation essentially changes near the reaction threshold , where all final particles are produced in @xmath56-state .",
    "the selection rules with respect to the pauli principle , the p - invariance and the conservation of isospin and of the total angular momentum , allow to parametrize the spin structure of the matrix element for @xmath8 and @xmath57-collisions as @xcite : @xmath58~(\\chi^{\\dagger}_4 \\sigma_a\\sigma_y\\tilde{\\chi}^{\\dagger}_3 ) , \\label{eq : mpp}\\ ] ] @xmath59~(\\chi^{\\dagger}_4 \\sigma_a\\sigma_y\\tilde{\\chi}^{\\dagger}_3 ) , \\label{eq : mnp } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we are using the following notations : @xmath60 is the unit vector along the 3-momentum of the initial nucleon ; @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the two - component spinors of the colliding nucleons , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the two - component spinors of the scattered nucleon and of the produced charmed baryon ; @xmath65 are the standard 2@xmath66 2 pauli matrices , @xmath67 is the singlet - triplet amplitude for @xmath68 or @xmath69 threshold production , @xmath70 is the triplet - triplet ( triplet - singlet ) amplitude .",
    "one can see that the amplitude @xmath67 is proportional to the isotopic amplitude @xmath52 . moreover , the isotopic amplitudes @xmath50 and @xmath51 have the same spin structure as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mpp ] ) . a direct consequence of the threshold spin structure , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mpp ] ) and ( [ eq : mnp ] ) , is that the interferences @xmath71 and @xmath72 , which can be present in the general case , vanish in the threshold region , after summing over the polarizations of the colliding nucleons .",
    "therefore we can derive the following relations , additional to ( [ eq : sig ] ) , between the differential cross sections , which hold for any model , at threshold : @xmath73 @xmath74 the normalization implicitely taken here is such that : @xmath75 for any process of @xmath57-interaction , whereas the term @xmath76 is missing for the cross section of any process of @xmath8-interaction .",
    "following the ideology of meson production in @xmath30-collisions , we consider different meson exchanges in @xmath77-channel , for different processes of associative charm particle production @xmath78 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) . taking into account the large difference in masses of the @xmath33-meson and the light mesons , @xmath79",
    ", one can expect mostly exchanges of non - charmed mesons in @xmath77-channel .",
    "this is not the case for threshold production of heavy hadrons , where large values of momentum transfer squared are involved : @xmath80 @xmath81 where @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 are the masses of the charmed baryon , @xmath85 and @xmath33-meson , respectively .",
    "the ratio of the propagators , @xmath86 , favors @xmath16-exchange , but the @xmath33-contribution can not be neglected .",
    "this kind of kinematical estimation does not work in case of associative strange particle production , @xmath87 , where , namely @xmath88meson exchange seems more probable than @xmath16-exchange @xcite .",
    "this is supported by , at least , two arguments : the relative value of the total cross section for @xmath11 and @xmath17-production near threshold , and the negative value of the @xmath10-coefficient in the process @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "therefore , as starting point for the present estimation , we will consider here only @xmath33-exchange .",
    "taking into account the identity of the colliding protons , the @xmath32-exchange is described by two feynman diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) , with the following matrix element : @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the threshold amplitude for @xmath95 elastic scattering , @xmath96 is the pseudoscalar coupling constant for the vertex @xmath97 , @xmath98 is the normalization factor , due to the presence of four baryons in the considered process , the factor @xmath99 results from the transformation of the dirac spinor product : @xmath100 to its two - component equivalent , @xmath101 ; @xmath102 is the threshold energy of the initial proton in the reaction cms , @xmath103 is the unit @xmath104-matrix .    we assume , in eq .",

    "( [ eq : mppf ] ) one can see that @xmath109 contains not only the structures which are allowed by symmetry selection rules , but also a contribution which corresponds to a singlet - triplet transition ( first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mppf ] ) ) .",
    "such transition is forbidden by the generalized pauli principle , following from the isotopic invariance of the strong interaction and should not appear in the total matrix element @xmath107 .",
    "this is an indication that only the contribution of both diagrams generates the correct answer .",
    "the expression for total matrix element @xmath107 is : @xmath110~(\\chi^{\\dagger}_4 \\sigma_a\\sigma_y \\tilde{\\chi}^{\\dagger}_3 ) \\right \\},\\label{eq : md } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the necessary threshold spin structure and with definite relation between the threshold partial amplitudes : @xmath111 comparing eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mppf ] ) and ( [ eq : md ] ) , one can conclude that the interference of the two diagrams ( fig .",

    "a coherent consideration of the two contributions is especially important for the analysis of polarization phenomena in the near threshold region .",
