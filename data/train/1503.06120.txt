    "briefly , when the embedding map @xmath62 varies in , the integrand changes by a cohomologically - trivial two - form on the cylinder @xmath63 . by stokes theorem , the variation of @xmath51 then reduces to an integral over the boundary circles in figure [ deleps ] . with some calculation",

    "because of the anomaly , all notions of self - linking involve a modification to the naive gauss integral in , as well as a refinement of the equivalence relation by smooth isotopy for the curve @xmath68 .",
    "for instance , in the original approach of @xcite , one adds to @xmath51 a counterterm @xmath69 whose variation with respect to @xmath62 is exactly opposite the variation in , @xmath70 the required counterterm is nothing more than the total torsion of @xmath40 measured with respect to arc - length , @xmath71 where the local frenet - serret @xcite torsion @xmath72 is given in terms of @xmath62 by @xmath73 for sake of brevity , we do not review the proof of here .",
    "a direct calculation of @xmath74 can be found in appendix b of @xcite .    from the relation in ,",
    "the sum @xmath75 does not change under any small deformation of @xmath40 , so it provides a reasonable notion of self - linking .",

    "like the linking number , the self - linking number in has a simple diagrammatic description . to derive it ,",

    ". see figure [ trefoil ] for a diagram of the trefoil knot which satisfies this condition .",
    "then @xmath82 is non - degenerate for all values of @xmath81 , and @xmath76 can be evaluated in the limit @xmath83 . for any plane curve , @xmath84 identically , so @xmath76 reduces to @xmath51 in this limit . otherwise , when @xmath81 is large and @xmath40 is nearly planar , the naive self - linking integral in reduces to a sum over the local writhe at each self - crossing of @xmath40 .",
