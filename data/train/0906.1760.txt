    "solar and stellar chromospheric models have been developed to study the dependency of chromospheric plasma parameters with height and temperature . *",
    "the best known examples are the models for the solar atmosphere computed by e. avrett and his co - workers , in particular model c for the average quit sun by @xcite , which was later modified by @xcite *    in several cases , these models were used to characterize changes due to activity and spectral type .",
    "for example , kelch et al . ( 1979 ) studied a sample of eight main - sequence stars ranging in spectral type from f0 to m0 , some of which were of similar spectral type and different levels of chromospheric activity .",
    "they computed the photospheric structure starting from a radiative equilibrium model for the  of each star and fitting the @xmath2  k line wings .",
    "the chromosphere was built using the emission core of the @xmath2  k line . to estimate the radiative cooling rate in the k line they used the k@xmath3 index @xcite , which is calculated as the difference between the integrated flux inside the two k@xmath3 minima of the @xmath2  k line and the corresponding flux for the model in radiative equilibrium .",
    "their results showed that non - radiative heating is important in the lower photosphere of all the late - type stars under study .",
    "they found that the value of the k@xmath3 index and the temperature gradient in the lower chromosphere of these stars , as a function of , divides active and inactive stars , and that the cooling rate in chromospheric lines decreases with . regarding the chromospheric structure",
    ", they found that the temperature minimum moves outward , to lower values of column mass density , with decreasing magnetic activity , _",
    "i.e. _ with decreasing non radiative heating in the lower chromosphere .",
    "semi - empirical models of the dm star ad leo in its quiescent state and during a flare were built by @xcite ( 1994 , 1996 ) .",
    "subsequently , models of two  basal \" ( _ i.e. _ inactive ) stars of the same spectral type , gl588 and gl628 , were constructed by @xcite .    in a previous paper (",
    "@xcite 2005 , hereafter paper i ) , we computed chromospheric models for a sample of dwarf stars of spectral type g , including the sun as a star , * using the fal models @xcite as a starting point*. our purpose was to study the changes in chromospheric structure induced by magnetic activity .",
    "the stars we modeled were chosen to have similar colors than the sun , and therefore similar photospheric structures , but different chromospheric activity levels , probably due to different ages and/or rotation periods .",
    "these stars can be considered as solar analogues , since they share several characteristics with the sun .    to extend our research to cooler stars and to study how the chromospheric structure changes with spectral type and chromospheric activity ,",
    "in this paper we perform a study similar to the one in paper i for several dwarfs of spectral type k , selected with similar colour , _",
    "i.e. _ similar photospheric structure , and with different levels of magnetic activity .    as the base for our sample we selected one of the most studied k stars , epsilon eridani ( hd 22049 ) , which is an active star of spectral type k2 v ( @xmath4=0.88 ) , with @xmath5  k.",
    "this star has been widely studied because it is one of the ten nearest stars .",
    "it has two planets and a belt of dust particles around it , which has been compared to the kuiper belt in the sun .",
    "these facts make this stellar system resemble our own solar system .",
    "several chromospheric models have been computed for this star .",
    "@xcite modeled the lower chromosphere to match the ca ii k line profile and integrated fluxes of the mg ii h and k lines . using observations of the ultraviolet lines of c",
    "ii , mg ii , si ii and si iii from the iue satellite , @xcite obtained a model for epsilon eridani , which also reproduces hydrogen line profiles not fitted by kelch s model . the thermal structure of this model has the onset of the transition zone deeper in the chromosphere and a lower temperature in the plateau than kelch s model .",
    "another chromospheric model for epsilon eridani is the one by @xcite , who fitted the ca ii k line , the infrared triplet lines of ca ii , the na d doublet , h@xmath6 and h@xmath1 .",
    "more recently , @xcite , using ultraviolet observations from stis and fuse , developed a new semiempirical model for the upper chromosphere and lower transition region of this star keeping the photosphere and lower chromosphere of @xcite .",
    "finally , @xcite studied the relative element abundances from the conora and upper transition region of epsilon eridani , using observations from chandra , eue , fuse and xmm - newton .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows : we present our stellar sample and discuss the observational data in  2 . in ",
    "3 we describe the models and show the results . in  4 we compute the energy requirements to sustain the chromosphere , and compare the results with those obtained for g stars in paper i. finally , in  5 we discuss the results .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : g ]      to build the atmospheric models for @xmath7 eri , as a first step we computed a photospheric structure capable of reproducing the observed continuum spectrum for this star .",
    "once the photospheric model was obtained , we changed the chromospheric structure to fit the @xmath2  k and h@xmath1 lines for both situations of interest , _ i.e. _ the maximum and minimum levels of chromospheric activity .",
    "this is the first time this sort of analysis is made .",
    "figure  [ erim ] shows the resulting models , which are presented in column mass for comparison with the best one - component model from sj05 ( their model b ) . in figure  [ cont ]",
    "we compare the computed and observed continuum spectrum of @xmath7 eri , and in figure  [ erimi ] and figure  [ erima ] we show the comparison of the observed and computed profiles for both levels of activity .",
    "it is important to note the good agreement of the fit , even better than the one by @xcite for all the diagnostic lines and continuum .    * on top of the chromosphere , we added a transition region with a similar structure to the solar one .",
    "since we have no observations of lines formed in this region , we could no constrain it further . however , the position at which the transition region begins was adjusted to fit the observed emission of the @xmath2  k line . *",
    "there are several differences between our model and the one by sj05 . in our model ,",
    "the photosphere is hotter , the temperature minimum region is narrower and the chromospheric rise has a larger slope .",
    "also , their transition region is placed deeper in the atmosphere , _",
    "i.e. _ , at higher values of the column mass .",
    "the differences between these models may be caused by several factors .",
    "as we have already noted , sj05 used a higher value of surface gravity which could explain the differences in all the thermal structure .",
    "the differences in the photospheric structure could arise from the fact that we used the complete spectra to fit the continuum emission , and sj05 used the photospheric model by @xcite , built to fit only the @xmath2  k line wings , which are formed in the higher photosphere .",
    "another important factor to consider is the moment of the activity cycle in which the observations used to build the model were taken . in our case ,",
    "all the lines used as diagnostics correspond to the same activity level since they were all observed simultaneously . but in the model by sj05 , the structure of the higher chromosphere and transition region was assembled with the model by @xcite for the lower chromosphere and photosphere , whitout taking into account that these thermal structures were obtained using line profiles that correspond to different parts of the activity cycle . for these reasons ,",
    "the comparison between these models is only qualitative .    regarding the differences in the atmospheric structure between the maximum and the minimum level of activity ,",
    "the changes occur all along the atmosphere ( figure  [ erim ] ) , from the temperature minimum to the transition region .",
    "the position of the minimum is the same in both situations , although the temperature increases from 3980 k to 4050 k.    * finally , to check whether our results are affected by the adopted value of the metallicity , we computed the emitted profiles for our models with the metallicity given by @xcite , which was used by @xcite , and we found no significant differences .",
    "this result is consistent with the one obtained by @xcite .",
    "*      to build the models for the other stars in the sample , we used solar metallicity and the same surface gravity that was used for @xmath7 eri .",
    "the stellar surface flux was computed with equation [ flux ] , using for each star the  values shown in table [ tab : ch ] .",
    "since we want to study the changes in thermal structure induced by activity , we made the approximation that all the stars have the same photosphere than @xmath7 eri .",
    "the models for the less active stars ( hd 128621 and hd 26965 in its maximum and minimum activity level , and @xmath7 eri in its minimum ) are shown in figure  [ menos ] .",
    "it can be seen that all these models have the temperature minimum between 60 and 100 km higher , and from 20 to 240 k cooler that @xmath7 eri in its minimum .",
    "the temperature in the chromosphere , from the temperature - minimum region up to 1100 km , increases with activity , although the largest differences are in the chromospheric plateau .",
    "these changes with activity are different to those obtained for g stars ( paper i ) with similar activity levels , because in that case only the temperature minimum region changed , and the rest of the atmospheric structure remained the same .    an important fact which can be seen in figure [ menos ] , is that the differences in the atmospheric structure for a star in its maximum and minimum activity levels are comparable to the changes seen beetwen two different stars .",
    "this fact stresses how important it is , when building an atmospheric model , the moment at which the observations to be ajusted are made , and , in particular , how important it is to use simultaneous observations of the diagnostic lines .    in figure  [ 128ma ] to [ 269mi ]",
    "we show the observed and computed profiles for @xmath6 cen b ( hd 128621 ) and hd 26965 in its maximum and minimum states .",
    "it is important to note the change in scale to compare with figures  [ erimi ] and [ erima ] , since these two stars are less active than @xmath7 eridani .",
    "the models for the most active stars ( hd 17925 in both activity levels , and hd 22049 , hd 37572 and hd 177996 in their maximum ) are shown in figure  [ mas ] .",
    "again the differences in the atmospheric structure for a star in its maximum and minimum activity levels are similar to the changes seen beetwen two different stars .",
    "in figure  [ mas ] it can be seen that for the stars in this group the temperature minimum is hotter than for the stars in figure  [ menos ] , and this temperature is almost constant as the activity level increases , varying only 50 k. the position of this region is also the same for all these stars . the atmospheric structure changes with activity everywhere in the chromosphere , mainly in the plateau and the rise to the transition region .",
    "the observed and synthetic profiles for the most active stars are compared in figures  [ 179ma ] to [ 177ma ] .",
    "again , it is important to note the change in the scale for comparison with the less active stars and the good fit in all cases .",
    "as was mentioned in @xcite , the ratio of the temperature in the minimum and the effective temperature ( @xmath8/@xmath9 ) gives an indication of the importance of nonradiative heating in the upper photosphere of stars . in that paper",
    ", they compare this ratio with @xmath9 to study the trend due to spectral type .",
    "in figure  [ tmin ] we plot this ratio versus , which is an indicator of the level of magnetic activity in the chromosphere for all stars independently of spectral type .",
    "the values of  were obtained by integration of the synthetic profiles , and in the figure we include the values obtained from the models for k stars built in this paper and those for g stars constructed in paper i.    in the figure it is possible to observe that there is a saturation in @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , its value increases with activity up to @xmath8/@xmath9 @xmath10 , and after that it remains almost constant even if activity increases further . on the other hand , the computed value of @xmath8/@xmath9 for g stars is larger than for k stars with similar activity levels .",
    "cc    in figure  [ lmin ] ( left ) we show the position of the temperature minimum region in column mass as a function of  for g ( paper i , triangles ) and k stars ( squares ) . for k stars the temperature minimum occurs deeper than for g stars , and there is a tendency for this region to move inward as activity grows . in other words , the temperature inversion occurs deeper for more active stars , indicating that the energy deposition starts deeper in the atmosphere as the activity level increases , for both spectral types . in figure  [ lmin ]",
    "we also show the position of the transition region ( tr ) , specifically the height at which the temperature reaches 36000 k. it can be seen that for g stars the chromosphere is more extended than for k stars , and that in both cases the tr moves inward as activity increases .    to study the energetic requirements to maintain the atmospheric structure ,",
    "we calculated the total net radiative loss for each model in the same way as in paper i. at a given depth , the radiative cooling rate @xmath11 ( ergs @xmath12 sec@xmath13 ) in a given spectral feature ( line or continuum ) can be computed as ( vernazza et al .",
    "1981 )    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the source function and @xmath16 is the mean intensity at frequency @xmath17 .",
    "a positive value of @xmath11 implies a net loss of energy ( cooling ) , and a negative value represents a net energy absorption .    here ,",
    "we considered line and continua of h , h- , h - ff , mg i and ii , fe i , si i , ca ii , na i and co. the total rates for each star are shown in figure  [ inact ] for the less active models , and in figure  [ act ] for the more active ones . as it is expected , the amount of non - radiative energy supplied to the chromosphere increases everywhere with magnetic activity .",
    "in both figures , it is possible to note a region where the net cooling rate is negative .",
    "this fact was already known for the sun ( vernazza et al .",
    "1981 ) , and was later found in paper i for other g stars , for which negative cooling rates in the temperature minimum region were also obtained . within the plane - parallel , homogeneous approximation we are investigating , this implies either mechanical energy extraction or , more likely , that the calculations have neglected important sources of radiative cooling ( see @xcite1993 ) .",
    "the main contributions in this zone are h- , si i , fe i and co , the same than for g stars .",
    "it is important to note that since the temperature for k stars is lower in this region , there could be an important contribution of several molecules which we do not consider in our calculations , like , for example , ch , that could act as cooling agents . considering these contributions",
    "could bring our computations closer to energy balance .    for the less active models the cooling rate becomes positive at around 300 km , implying that there is mechanical energy deposition above this height .",
    "for the most active models , this energy deposition starts deeper in the atmosphere , _",
    "i.e. _ the chromosphere starts deeper .",
    "also in the chromosphere , the most important contributors to the cooling rate are the same than for g stars , but the proportions are different : for @xmath7 eri in its minimum , for example , mg ii and ca ii contribute with @xmath18 each , while for the sun these contributions are of @xmath19 .",
    "the contribution by fe i , on the other hand , is of @xmath20 in @xmath7 eri , but only @xmath21 in the sun . in both cases",
    ", almost half of the total cooling rate corresponds to line blanketing .    finally , to quantify the total amount of mechanical energy deposited in the chromosphere , we integrated the net radiative cooling rate from the depth in the chromosphere where the cooling rate becomes positive to the region where the temperature reaches @xmath22 k. to compare the results for both spectral types , we normalized the integrated rate , @xmath23 , by the surface luminosity ( @xmath24 ) * the resulting quantity , therefore , gives an idea of the fraction of the total energy emitted by the star that goes into heating the chromosphere .",
    "* the results are shown in figure  [ svsco2 ] , where it can be seen that there is a unique trend for all stars , independently of spectral type .",
    "this fact seems to imply that the physical processes that supply the energy to sustain the atmospheric structure are independent of spectral type .",
    "given the good corelation between  and the normalized @xmath23 , we fit the data with a polynomial function , given by @xmath25 in figure  [ svsco2 ] it can be seen that the fit is very good and , therefore , the energetic requirements of a given star can be estimated from its chromospheric activity level as mesured by .",
    "one of the main goals of chromospheric modelling is to accurately estimate the radiative losses in the chromosphere in detail , using only the information that can be obtained from the observations , without any assumption about the physical processes involved . in this way",
    ", these losses can be equaled to the energy requirements that any proposed mechanism of chromospheric heating should match .",
    "* for example , we saw in the previous section that the contribution of the different features to the total cooling rate is not the same for g and k stars .",
    "in particular , the ca ii , mg ii and fe i relative contributions are not the same for both spectral types .",
    "therefore , it might not be correct to scale the relative contributions computed for the sun to k stars , as it has been done sometimes ( see @xcite @xcite , and @xcite @xcite ) . *    cuntz et al . ( 1999 ) computed theoretical two - component models for k dwarfs of different activity levels .",
    "they proposed that the energy is deposited in the chromosphere by acoustic and magnetic shocks , and found that these shocks are stronger and are produced deeper in the chromosphere as the activity of the star increases .",
    "this result is in agreement with our calculations , which shows that the energy deposition is larger and deposited deeper with increasing activity .    on the other hand",
    ", they reproduced the lineal trend between the @xmath2  h and k lines fluxes and the rotational period , although their computed fluxes are smaller than the observations , which could be due to their sketchy calculation of the radiative cooling rate .",
    "in this paper we present chromospheric models for six k dwarfs , including @xmath7 eridani , with similar photospheric properties but different magnetic activity levels . in most cases we computed models for two moments of the activity cycle for the same star .",
    "these models were based on , and reproduced very well , the ca ii h and k and the h@xmath1 line profiles for all the stars in our sample .",
    "the reliability of the stellar atmospheric models was checked with other features , the na i d and mg i b lines .",
    "also for these lines we found very good agreement between computed and observed profiles .",
    "we found that the changes in atmospheric structure in k dwarfs with activity are produced all along the chromosphere , from the region of the temperature minimum to the transition region and mainly in the chromospheric plateau , independently of the activity level of the star .",
    "this was not the case for the g dwarfs modelled in paper i , since for the less active g stars the changes with activity occur only in the region of the temperature minimum .",
    "the ratio of the minimum and effective temperatures ( @xmath8/@xmath9 ) can give an idea of the importance of non - radiative heating in the upper photosphere of stars .",
    "both for k and g stars , this value increases with activity up to @xmath8/@xmath9 @xmath10 , where it saturates , and it remains constant even if the activity level increases further . on the other hand , the computed value of @xmath8/@xmath9 for g stars is larger than for k stars with similar activity .    for both spectral types , the position of the temperature minimum moves inward as activity increases , implying that the chromosphere starts deeper in more active stars .",
    "this , in turn , implies that as the activity level increases , the energy deposition occurs deeper in the atmosphere .    on the other hand ,",
    "the transition region is placed at higher column masses for g stars than for k stars , and in both cases it moves inward as activity increases .    regarding the energetic requirements , the integrated chromospheric radiative losses , normalized to the surface luminosity ,",
    "show a unique trend for g and k dwarfs when plotted against @xmath26 , the main proxy of stellar activity .",
    "this might indicate that the same physical processes are heating the stellar chromospheres in both cases .",
    "we calculated an empirical relationship between the index and the energy deposited in the chromosphere , which can be used to estimate the energetic requirements of a given star knowing its chromospheric activity level .",
    "there are significant differences in the contributions of mg ii , ca ii and fe i to the total net cooling rate in the chromosphere between g and k stars , which implies that values obtained for a given star should not be extrapolated to another one of a different spectral type . in both cases about half of the total rate",
    "is due to line blanketing .",
