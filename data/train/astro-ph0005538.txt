    "as well known , the production of neutrinos from @xmath6 is an important item in the context of the so called `` solar neutrino puzzle '' for several reasons : + i ) the result of gallium experiments would be ( partially ) consistent with the hypothesis of standard neutrinos only if beryllium neutrino ( @xmath0 ) production rate , @xmath7 , is suppressed by an order of magnitude with respect to the prediction of the standard solar model ( ssm ) , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "+ ii ) if one accepts neutrino oscillations as the solution of the solar neutrino puzzle , the determination of the neutrino mass matrix depends however on the predicted value of @xmath7 .",
    "+ iii ) direct experiments aiming to the determination of the @xmath0 signal are in preparation and of course the interpretation of their result will rely on @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the ssm prediction for beryllium neutrinos @xcite , @xmath8 is very robust , much more than that of boron neutrinos .",
    "however any additional information which does not rely on ssm are clearly welcome . in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we have shown that helioseismology , supplemented with the superkamiokande result on @xmath9b neutrinos , already yields a lower limit for @xmath10be production : @xmath11 in this paper we make a step forward and we provide a determination of @xmath7 directly by means of helioseismology without using additonal assumptions . the basic idea is the following . in the ssm",
    "the pp - ii termination ( which is the beryllium production branch ) accounts for an appreciable fraction of the @xmath12he produced near the solar center . as a consequence ,",
    "if beryllium production were suppressed  now and in the past  less @xmath12he would have been produced near the center . as a consequence",
    ", the molecular weight there decreases and one expects that the sound speed increases in this region .",
    "in other words , we know that ssm calculations are in good agreement with helioseismology and we can expect that this agreement is spoiled if @xmath0 production is substantially altered .    in refs . @xcite it was shown that models where the production of @xmath0 is ( artificially ) forbidden are in conflict with helioseismology . in this paper",
    "we attempt to a quantitative determination of the @xmath10be - neutrino luminosity . in order to fulfill this program ,",
    "we have constructed solar models where @xmath0 production is artifically changed by varying in an arbitrary way the zero energy astrophysical s - factor ( @xmath1 ) for the reaction @xmath2 . as well known ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the production rate @xmath7 is directly proportional to @xmath1 , so that this is an efficient way for arbitrary variations of @xmath7 .",
    "we remind that @xmath1 is measured with an accuracy of about ten per cent , ( @xmath13 kevb @xcite ) .",
    "its variation well beyond the experimental uncertainty is just a way of simulating several effects which have been claimed to suppress @xmath0 production , e.g. hypothetical plasma effects which could alter nuclear reaction rates .",
    "these effects , which correspond to an anomalous screening effect , can be described by introducing an effective zero energy astrophysical factor @xmath14 .",
    "as well known , helioseismology determines quite accurately several properties of the sun , see e.g. @xcite : + a ) the depth of the convective envelope @xmath15 and the photospheric helium abundance @xmath16 are determined as : @xmath17 @xmath18 where here and in the following the so called `` statistical '' or 1@xmath19 uncertainties are considered @xcite .",
    "+ b ) the sound speed profile is determined with an accuracy of about 0.2% in the intermediate solar region , say between 0.1 - 0.7@xmath20 .",
    "recent ssm calculations , see e.g. @xcite , are in good agreement with these observational data within the quoted errors ( with the possible exception of the sound speed just below the convective envelope , which is slightly underestimated in the calculated models @xcite ) .    by keeping as a free parameter @xmath21",
    "we have built a series of solar models .",
    "this means that , for a fixed value for @xmath22 , the stellar evolution code franec @xcite was run by varying the three free parameters of the model ( initial helium abundance @xmath23 , initial metal abundance @xmath24 and mixing length @xmath25 ) until it provides a solar structure , i.e. it reproduces the observed solar luminosity , radius and photospheric metal abundance at the solar age .",
    "as well known by varying @xmath1 the @xmath0 luminosity scales linearly , see e.g. @xcite and fig .",
    "[ figflussi ] .",
    "in fact , the production rate of be nuclei is obviously proportional to @xmath1 and practically each beryllium nucleus produces one @xmath0 ( neglecting the small probability of proton capture compared with that of electron capture ) .",
    "the photospheric helium abundance @xmath16 is weekly sensitive to the value of @xmath1 whereas the depth of the convective envelope @xmath15 is altered by more than @xmath4 if @xmath1 is reduced below one half of the ssm value , i.e. : @xmath26 as previously mentioned , one expects that the sound speed is altered , particularly near the solar center .",
    "in fact , stringent constraints arise from the sound speed profile , particularly near @xmath27 .",
    "the requirement that the sound speed is not changed by more than @xmath4 yields : @xmath28 in conclusion , helioseismology directly confirms the production rate of beryllium neutrinos as predicted by ssms to within @xmath3 ( @xmath4 error ) .",
    "this constraint is somehow weaker than that estimated from uncertainties of the ssm , see eq .",
    "[ eqlbessm ] , however it relies on direct observational data .",
    "finally we remark that the helioseismic determination of @xmath10be - neutrino production rate also shows that the sun is producing @xmath10be nuclei and that the @xmath10be abundance is correctly calculated by ssms ."
