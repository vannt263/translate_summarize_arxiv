    "traditionally , studies of excitations of the nucleus via the interactions between leptons and the nucleus have been centered mostly on the longitudinal ( @xmath0 ) and transverse ( @xmath1 ) nuclear response functions explored in unpolarized , inelastic , _ inclusive _ @xmath2 electron scattering . the present paper will also be largely restricted to the investigation of these quantities , although the set of experimentally accessible responses is much larger , including also semi - inclusive responses and responses that arise when initial or final hadronic degrees of freedom are active . in the former ,",
    "particles are detected in coincidence with the scattered electron @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 etc . ) , whereas the latter includes reactions such as @xmath6 @xmath7 etc .",
    "of course , in all cases the incident electron may also be polarized .",
    "a concerted effort is presently being placed on experimental studies of this extended set of responses where special sensitivities to normally hidden aspects of nuclear structure are expected to exist .",
    "such studies are very challenging and thus only relatively recently have they been made feasible by advances in accelerators , in developments of polarized electron beams and polarized nuclear targets , and in the construction of the required hadron polarimetry .",
    "issues still surround the inclusive unpolarized responses themselves , however , and since a successful level of understanding of the underlying nuclear dynamics would be incomplete without a coherent picture of the entire set of responses , unpolarized inclusive _ and _ semi - inclusive / polarized , the former still deserve continued study and so provide the focus for the present article .    beyond the electromagnetic ( em : parity - conserving , vector ) responses @xmath0 and @xmath1 our study will also include their parity - violating analogs @xmath8 and @xmath9 as well as the nuclear parity - violating axial response @xmath10 .",
    "here av indicates that the axial leptonic and vector hadronic currents enter ; va indicates the converse .",
    "this larger set of inclusive responses may be explored via the inclusive scattering of longitudinally polarized electrons from unpolarized nuclei , since the electron helicity asymmetry is parity - violating .",
    "the three new responses all arise from interferences between the weak neutral current ( wnc ) and em current . in the cases of @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "it is the vector part of the wnc that enters and this is believed to be closely related to the em current ( in the absence of strangeness content in the nucleus these two responses are tied to @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) ; in the case of @xmath10 it is the _ axial _ part of the wnc that enters , namely an interesting new inclusive nuclear response function .",
    "the vector responses ( the four labeled either l or t ) are , of course , interesting in their own right , since disentangling them through measurements of both parity - conserving and -violating inclusive electron scattering would permit the isolation of the isoscalar and isovector contributions they contain , as will be discussed in detail later .",
    "accomplishing this separation would represent a significant step forward in our understanding of nuclear structure : indeed , for a long time researchers have sought possible ways of `` measuring '' how nuclear correlations work in the isoscalar and isovector channels .",
    "a further point worth noting is that analogous responses also play a role in the scattering of hadrons from nuclei .",
    "however , in order to interpret the experimental data properly , in addition to the response functions there one also needs a reliable description of the reaction mechanism .",
    "in fact , unlike either real or virtual photons , hadrons are mostly absorbed or scattered at the surface of the nucleus .",
    "moreover , the hadrons disrupt the nucleus to a much larger extent than do photons , and therefore the interpretation of reactions induced by photons is generally felt to be under better control than those induced by hadrons . moderating this statement to some degree",
    "is the fact that electron scattering is still somewhat flawed by a not yet fully satisfactory understanding of dispersive effects and of the distortion of the electron waves moving in the em potential of the nucleus .",
    "accurate knowledge of the nuclear response functions gained with electron scattering provides a way to test the reaction mechanisms of the models employed in hadron scattering .",
    "however , the electroweak studies do not provide all of the information we seek and in this regard it is worth noting that in some cases reactions induced by hadrons give access to nuclear responses that are not easily extracted in electron scattering , the best example in this connection being offered by the long sought after spin - longitudinal isovector response .",
    "turning now to the problem of modeling the nuclear response functions , in the present work we confine our attention to the quasifree region , which is well suited for a microscopic treatment in terms of nucleons and mesons , specifically in terms of the standard field theoretical techniques that we employ .",
    "although the @xmath11 peak may also be treated in the same framework , it will not be dealt with here to curb the length of this article .",
    "since we are concerned with kinematical regions where relativistic effects are relevant , a good starting point for the development of our approach is given by the _",
    "relativistic fermi gas _ ( rfg ) , a covariant model in the sense that its ingredients are the fully relativistic nucleon propagators and em / wnc vertices .",
    "of course the rfg misses surface and finite - size effects .",
    "first of all , these are of secondary importance in obtaining a general understanding of the scattering of electrons in the quasielastic and @xmath11 peak domains .",
    "secondly , they can be accounted for within the semiclassical approach , which exploits the advantages offered by the translational invariance of the rfg and yet is able to incorporate some of the physics of a finite system .    as discussed in detail later",
    ", the perturbative approach we follow requires the setting up of a nuclear mean field ( hartree - fock , hf ) and the treatment of the residual interaction effects in the fully antisymmetrized _ random phase approximation _ ( rpa ) .",
    "in addition one needs as preliminary input the nucleon - nucleon force : since we would like to view the nucleus as an interacting system of baryons and mesons , a natural choice in this connection is given by a meson - exchange interaction such as the bonn potential , which can be cast in the framework of an effective field theory .",
    "another preliminary problem relates to the short - range nuclear correlations induced by the violent repulsion present in the nucleon - nucleon force at small distances .",
    "a technique for their treatment is indeed available , namely the summation of the brueckner ladder diagrams ; however , it is not yet possible to employ this technique covariantly especially at high density , where on the one hand ladder diagrams are increasingly important and on the other the role of relativity can not be ignored . in lieu of this ,",
    "in a few of the results discussed in the following section we shall indicate what insight can be gained by employing a parameterization of a non - relativistic @xmath12-matrix based on the bonn potential .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , in past years quasielastic electron scattering from nuclei has been the subject of intense experimental @xcite and theoretical ( see , e.  g. , refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite ) investigations .",
    "the first aim of the theoretical studies is to test the available nuclear models ; once the nuclear physics issues are well understood , one might then hope to gain insight into other aspects of the problem , for instance into the form factors of the nucleon , which can be extracted from the data with an accuracy that is strictly connected to our ability to handle the nuclear physics .    in principle , the quasifree regime is thought to be the obvious place to focus on , as one hopes that there the physical quantities of interest may be computed in a reliable way , while also in this case in practice one has to cope with significant problems .",
    "many diverse techniques have been employed in the literature .",
    "each of them has its own relative merits and deficiencies and clearly it would be highly desirable to be able to reach some degree of convergence in their outcomes .    in the following @xcite , we shall be concerned with green s function techniques as introduced , e.  g. , in ref .",
    "this method can be , and has been , applied both to finite nuclei and nuclear matter . here , we shall focus on nuclear matter , having in mind applications to electron scattering ( that is , without the complications introduced by the reaction mechanism of hadronic probes ) in a range from a few hundreds to about 1 gev / c of transferred momentum where the quasielastic peak is far from low - energy resonances and not too much affected by finite - size effects .",
    "the use of nuclear matter reduces the computational load , thus allowing a more straightforward implementation of more sophisticated theoretical schemes than would otherwise be feasible , and this makes it easier to develop and test approximation methods that might subsequently also be utilized for calculations in finite nuclei .",
    "let us now briefly summarize the theoretical framework that we shall discuss in detail in the following subsections .    a first issue one has to confront in setting up the formalism concerns the treatment of relativistic effects .",
    "kinematical effects , while obviously rather important , can be included in a straightforward way .",
    "the treatment of dynamical effects is more delicate .",
    "two main paths have been followed in the literature , either using field theoretical methods ( as done , e.  g. , in the walecka model and its derivations @xcite ) or using potential techniques ( i.  e. , employing phenomenological potentials truncated at some order in the non - relativistic expansion ) . here",
    "we shall take the second path , but to limit the amount of material to be covered , we shall discuss only non - relativistic potentials .",
    "the extensions necessary to include higher - order relativistic terms are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the nuclear response functions have been calculated using techniques similar to the ones explained below , using as an input the relativistic bonn potential @xcite expanded in powers of @xmath13 and @xmath14 up to second order  @xmath15 and @xmath16 being the average of the incoming and outgoing nucleon momenta and the exchanged momentum , respectively . as shown in @xcite , the effect of these dynamical relativistic corrections",
    "is significant ; indeed , the validity of that expansion at high momenta and the inclusion in that framework of short - range nucleon - nucleon correlations has yet to be explored ( see , however , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "next , one should choose the phenomenological input potential and , in connection with this choice , attempt to cope with the problem of dealing with short - range correlations .",
    "all of the formulae given in the following sections are based on a generic one - boson - exchange potential .",
    "they can thus be used both with a bare phenomenological interaction  such as one of the bonn potential variants  or with a one - boson - exchange parameterization of the @xmath12-matrix generated from some potential .",
    "the use of an effective interaction derived from a @xmath12-matrix is a common way of including short - range correlations .",
    "however , apart from the relativistic issue , one should be aware of possible problems due to the use of a local potential to fit non - local matrix elements . at least in a few cases discussed in the literature this does not appear to be a reason for concern @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , possible effects arising only in the quasielastic regime remain completely unexplored .",
    "indeed , @xmath12-matrices employed in quasielastic calculations are usually generated using bound - state boundary conditions , which make them real and practically energy - independent , while in general they are both complex and energy - dependent .",
    "once we have fixed the effective interaction , we can proceed to consider a hierarchy of approximation schemes .",
    "the lowest - order approximation is , of course , given by the free fermi gas .",
    "then , one may include mean - field correlations at the hf level ( or brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) if short - range correlations are accounted for ) . in nuclear matter",
    "a hf calculation can be done exactly without too much effort .",
    "later we show how a quite accurate analytic approximation can be derived , and how this is needed to combine the hf and rpa schemes .",
    "the latter is the last resummation technique we shall discuss .",
    "it should be noticed that even in nuclear matter the calculation of the _ antisymmetrized _ rpa response functions is not trivial .",
    "indeed , most calculations , labeled `` rpa '' in the literature , are actually performed in the so - called `` ring approximation '' , where only the direct contributions are kept . for this case ,",
    "in nuclear matter one gets a simple algebraic equation for the response . here , we use the continued fraction ( cf ) technique to provide a semi - analytical estimate of the full rpa response ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for alternative methods ) .",
    "calculations with this method have been performed both in finite nuclei @xcite and in nuclear matter @xcite , always truncating the cf expansion at first order because of the difficulty of the numerical calculations involved .",
    "we have pushed the analytical calculation far enough to yield not only a fast and accurate estimate of the first - order cf contribution , but also of the second - order one .",
    "since the rate of convergence of the cf expansion can not be assessed on the basis of general theorems , this is the only way of getting a quantitative grip on the quality of the approximation .",
    "as mentioned before , hf ( and kinematical relativistic ) effects can then be incorporated in the rpa calculation , yielding as the final approximation scheme a hf - rpa ( or bhf - rpa ) response function .",
    "of course , several many - body contributions have been left out in our analysis .",
    "however the classes of many - body diagrams discussed here already allow one to capture the main features of the quasielastic response and , since semi - analytical methods have been developed for their computation , our formalism constitutes a valid starting point for the study of other many - body effects .",
    "we consider an infinite system of interacting nucleons at some density fixed by the fermi momentum @xmath17 .",
    "for the kinetic energies of the nucleons we can choose either relativistic or non - relativistic expressions , whereas we assume that the interactions take place through a non - relativistic potential . for the latter the following expression in momentum space",
    "is assumed @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the standard tensor operator and @xmath20 represents the momentum space potential in channel @xmath21 .",
    "here @xmath20 has the general form of a static one - boson - exchange potential so that in each spin - isospin channel , namely @xmath22 , it is represented as a sum of contributions from different mesons , @xmath23 . in the central channels",

    "the correlation diagrams to be evaluated in this scheme are the so - called self - energy and exchange contributions , that when iterated to infinite order generate the previously discussed hf and rpa series , respectively .",

    "@xcite is indeed quite accurate up to momentum transfers of the order of 1 gev / c .",
    "the outcome of this is that sizable pionic contributions to the em longitudinal ( spin scalar , @xmath301 ) and transverse ( spin vector , @xmath302 ) nuclear responses are found . in both cases",
    "the correlation effects produce a hardening of the responses , that is , a shift of the strength to higher @xmath48 .",
    "the pv longitudinal and transverse correlated responses are simply obtained from the em ones through the isospin rotations implied by the structure of the wnc discussed in the previous subsection ; the axial - vector response will be treated separately in section [ subsec : axas ] .",
    "the main points emerging from this analysis are :    * in isospace the contribution of the self - energy diagram to the charge response is almost equally split between isoscalar ( @xmath303 ) and isovector ( @xmath304 ) components .",
    "the latter , on the other hand , is of course overwhelming in the transverse response , due to the dominance of the isovector magnetic moment .",
    "in contrast , in the case of the pionic force the @xmath303 part of the exchange diagram turns out to be _ three times as large _ as the @xmath304 one in the charge response and this imbalance , that becomes even stronger in higher orders of perturbation theory , is further strengthened by the difference between the isoscalar and isovector form factors .",

    "[ fig : diagrams - free ] , where the diagrams describing both the em and pv longitudinal responses for a free system are displayed , one easily understands why in the non - interacting case the em longitudinal response turns out to be substantial : both of its vertices can in fact be large , as they involve the coupling of a longitudinal photon to a proton .",
    "in contrast , one of the vertices entering in the non - interacting pv response is _ always _ small , since either the longitudinal coupling of a photon to a neutron or of a @xmath249 to a proton is involved .",
    "this last fact is often phrased by saying that the @xmath305 is blind to neutrons and the @xmath249 is blind to protons ( i.e. , in the longitudinal channel ) . to quantify the meaning of `` large '' and `` small '' we note that typically the @xmath306 coupling is about 1/10 that of the @xmath307 , and likewise the @xmath308 coupling is about 1/10 that of the @xmath309 . + the exchange correlations corresponding to the exchange of an isovector charged meson between the particle and hole convert a neutron ( proton ) into a proton ( neutron ) , and thus give rise to a diagram where _ both _ couplings are _ large _  hence the crucial role of such isovector correlations in determining @xmath257 .",
    "+ the above arguments clearly do not apply to the transverse response both because in this case the @xmath303 channel is much weaker than the @xmath304 channel , being essentially proportional to the squares of the very different isoscalar and isovector magnetic moments of the nucleon , and furthermore because protons and neutrons can both couple strongly to photons via their ( comparable ) magnetic moments .",
    "being also essentially isovector , the axial - vector response likewise does not display the sensitivity expected for the longitudinal response .",
    "* while the tensor component of the opep never contributes to the self - energy in a translationally invariant system , the exchange diagram gets a tensor contribution , _ but only in the transverse channel _ and mostly via the backward - going graphs .",
    "this implies a different role for the pionic force in the two em responses , a finding that should be tested against experiment .",
    "* when we extend our analysis from first to infinite order of perturbation theory , thus generating the hf and rpa responses , the results do not change substantially .",
    "although the pionic interaction is strong , it nevertheless therefore appears that for quasielastic kinematics its effects are reasonably small at not too small @xmath16 , thus rendering perturbation theory quite accurate already at the lowest order , at least for the classes of diagrams studied here . *",
    "the contribution of the central part of the pionic interaction to the exchange diagram stems largely from the @xmath28-force and not from the finite - range one .",
    "notably for pointlike nucleons the continuity equation is obeyed by the opep and by the related pionic mec , but is not affected by its @xmath28 component . however in keeping with the usual approach taken in studies of pionic effects , we include a @xmath310nn vertex function @xmath311 , whose scale is set by a mass parameter @xmath312 , to smear out the @xmath28-piece of opep . as a consequence",
    "the continuity equation is modified by the presence of @xmath311 and to restore its validity additional mec should be introduced .",
    "significantly these counterterms affect only the pion - in - flight current , which is tiny , and therefore are quantitatively negligible . * in contrast to the exchange diagram , the self - energy term gets a contribution only from momentum - dependent forces , and therefore an unmodified pionic @xmath28-interaction does not contribute in this channel .",
    "in fact , the contribution coming from the @xmath28-function in opep , when modified by the @xmath310nn vertex form factor , contains an effective momentum - dependence and so is nonzero . *",

    "@xcite , thus showing the central role played by the pion in the nuclear dynamics for quasielastic kinematics .",
    "this is accomplished , however , through rather subtle aspects of the nuclear many - body problem , where the interference between the pion and the other mesons turns out to be crucial .",
    "let us now turn to a discussion of the asymmetry in the pion - correlated fermi gas model . for its evaluation the axial - vector response function @xmath259 is needed . in a non - relativistic context",
    "the latter is related to the isovector component of the em transverse response , @xmath313 , through the simple formula @xcite @xmath314 which can be extended into the relativistic regime via the prescription @xmath315 these agree to better than 2% in the momentum range 300 mev / c @xmath316 gev / c for the rfg . although not immediately apparent , eq .",

    "this trend of course fades away at larger @xmath83 , where the role of the longitudinal pv response gradually becomes irrelevant .",
    "finally , we see that at larger momenta , where the impact of correlations is no longer so strongly felt , the nearly perfect restoration of the left - right symmetry does not show up anymore .",

    "it is also clear that the correlations , in particular the exchange diagram , dramatically alter the prediction of the free rfg , yielding a huge @xmath334 at small @xmath83 .",
    "this result is simply interpreted by observing that of the nuclear responses that enter in the asymmetry the pion has its greatest effect on @xmath257 and although in the rfg model the latter accounts only for at most about 10% of the total asymmetry ( and this only in the forward direction ) , nevertheless the impact of the pionic correlations is violent enough to induce a large negative value of @xmath257 at small @xmath48 , which is in turn reflected in the large negative value of @xmath334 at small @xmath83 displayed in fig .",

    "in this paper we have discussed the parity - conserving and violating- inclusive nuclear responses , addressing the following issues    * where do they occur ? * how can we describe them ? * what is their input ?    with respect to the first item we have limited our focus to the quasielastic peak ( qep ) , since at larger excitation energies where for example the @xmath11 plays a role we do not expect a description of the nucleus only in terms of nucleonic and mesonic degrees of freedom to be adequate . at some point",
    "qcd degrees of freedom should become the more appropriate ones to describe inclusive scattering . on the other hand at energies significantly lower than those characterizing the qep where discrete excitations , giant resonances , etc .",
    "are seen the theoretical many - body framework is different from the one used here .",
    "concerning the second item let us again stress that _ any _ theoretical framework should first fulfill ( as much as possible ) lorentz covariance and gauge invariance .",
    "for this the rfg appears to be a good starting point : it is a covariant model , since its ingredients are the fully relativistic nucleon propagators and em ( or wnc ) vertices , and it respects gauge invariance , since the vector currents of the nucleon are conserved .",
    "when mesons are added to the picture then lorentz covariance and gauge invariance are fulfilled to the extent that one allows for a dynamical propagation of the mesons and treats the forces and the currents consistently .",
    "this turns out to be possible for the case of the pion .",
    "of course the rfg misses surface and finite - size effects ; however , first of all , these are of minor relevance for the scattering of electrons in the qep and @xmath11 peak domains , and secondly , they can be satisfactorily accounted for within the semiclassical approach , which exploits the advantages offered by the translational invariance of the rfg and accommodates these advantages to fit the physics of finite systems @xcite .    in the framework of the rfg we have treated nucleon - nucleon correlations in a perturbative scheme .",
    "alternatives are represented by    * variational approaches * loop expansions in the path integral framework , which however represent an alternative regrouping of perturbation theory .",
    "concerning perturbation theory we have seen that basic ingredients are the diagrams associated with the hf mean field and those related to the _ antisymmetrized _ rpa .",
    "the emphasis on the antisymmetrization arises from the recognition that very important carriers of the nuclear force , notably @xmath310 and @xmath207 mesons , only act through the exchange diagrams .",
    "the short - range correlations ( src ) induced by the violent repulsion present in the n - n force at small distances are then inserted via the ladder diagrams .",
    "it is , however , doubtful whether ladders can be covariantly computed , especially at high densities ( or fermi momenta @xmath17 ) where they become increasingly important and the role of relativity can not be ignored .",
    "in addition , it may be that searching for a totally deterministic account of the n - n correlations is not the optimal way to proceed  should , for example , quantum chaos be at work in atomic nuclei , then costly efforts to compute src would not represent the most efficient way of interpreting the nuclear response functions .    a further serious challenge facing the perturbative approach relates to the estimate of the size of diagrams that are not considered . in this connection",
    "it appears that only the loop expansion offers a consistent criterion ( the number of loops ) to organize the perturbative series in classes of homogeneous diagrams allowing at the same time an estimate of the rate of convergence of the resulting new expansion .",
    "however , although this is theoretically established , its practical implementation is far from trivial .    finally a few words on the input to be fed into the perturbative scheme are appropriate . in general the bonn potential",
    "appears as a well - founded representation of the n - n force .",
    "indeed it provides an excellent representation of the energy behavior of the n - n phase shifts in free space and of the deuteron s properties .",
    "in addition , it can be derived from a lagrangian defined in terms of nucleonic and mesonic fields , and therefore cast in the framework of an effective field theory that , from the theoretical viewpoint , represents a highly desirable feature . in particular , it allows for a test of the gauge invariance of the theory , i.e. the consistency between the forces and currents . in this connection",
    "it is worthwhile to emphasize that the most direct way to assess the validity of the mesons - plus - nucleons model of the nucleus ultimately rests on a deeper understanding of the role of meson exchange currents ( mec ) in the nuclear responses .",
    "much has been done in this field , although much remains to be done .",
    "it seems to us that at present the analysis of the nuclear responses is best performed on the basis of a hadronic approach such as the one we have pursued using the bonn potential .",
    "it is important to remember , however , that such potentials are being used for nucleons within the nucleus and that these are differently off - shell from the conditions found in studying n - n scattering or the ground state of the deuteron .    in summary , in section ii of the present article we have analyzed the quasielastic response functions for inclusive electron scattering in the standard framework of hf plus rpa .",
    "in addition , the impact of short - range correlations on the effective particle - hole force has been explored within the context of the g - matrix approach .",
    "the analysis has then been extended in section iii to include the observables that occur in studying parity - violating electron scattering , with emphasis placed on the `` new '' nuclear axial response . in section iv the attention has been directed towards several general , important properties of the response functions , in particular their coulomb sum rule and scaling / superscaling behavior . finally , a short account of what lies ahead has been provided in section v.",
