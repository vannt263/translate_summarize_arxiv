    "the circumstellar disk plays a crucial role in star and planet formation .",
    "gas in the infalling envelope is thought to initially accrete onto the circumstellar disk .",
    "part of the gas in the disk is ejected by the protostellar outflow or stellar wind and returns to interstellar space , whereas the remainder finally falls onto the protostar and contributes to protostellar mass growth . in the circumstellar disk ,",
    "the solid component settles into the disk equatorial plane , and rocky cores or rocky planets form @xcite .",
    "then , a rocky core acquires its mass from the circumstellar disk and evolves into a gas giant planet @xcite . thus , without considering the circumstellar disk , we can not investigate the formation of stars and planets .    despite its importance , the formation process of the circumstellar disk is still controversial .",
    "observationally , circumstellar disks were first identified by their spectral energy distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "recent direct observations have yielded various types of information on circumstellar disks @xcite .",
    "the observations indicate that a sufficiently mature disk generally exists around class i and ii protostars @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the circumstellar disk is considered to grow during the class 0 phase , because a dense infalling envelope can provide sufficient gas to the disk @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have to observe circumstellar disks around class 0 protostars to investigate disk formation ; however a dense infalling envelope impedes direct observation of these disks .",
    "although very recent observations confirm the existence of a ( forming or growing ) circumstellar disk around class 0 protostars ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a theoretical approach is required to clarify the formation and evolution of the circumstellar disk .    because a prestellar cloud core has an angular momentum much larger than that of the star @xcite ,",
    "the formation of the circumstellar disk has been considered a natural consequence of angular momentum conservation . however , in addition to the angular momentum or rotation , the magnetic field is also an important ingredient in circumstellar disk formation .",
    "the angular momentum in a star - forming core can be transferred by magnetic effects such as magnetic braking @xcite and protostellar outflow @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field can be amplified by rotation or shearing motion around the protostar , and an amplified field effectively transfers the angular momentum outward , slowing the disk rotation .",
    "therefore , it is very difficult to analytically investigate disk formation in the collapsing cloud considering the effects of both the rotation and magnetic field . as a result ,",
    "it is necessary to use numerical simulations to investigate the formation and evolution of the circumstellar disk .    for this , we need to calculate the evolution of the collapsing cloud ( or molecular cloud core ) from the prestellar stage while resolving the region where the circumstellar disk forms",
    ". however , the spatial scales and timescales of the molecular cloud core and circumstellar disk considerably differ .",
    "the difference between the spatial scales of the ( prestellar ) molecular cloud core ( @xmath4au ) and circumstellar disk ( @xmath5au ) or protostar ( @xmath6au ) has been overcome with adaptive mesh refinement ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or nested grid ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) techniques .",
    "however , even with such techniques , the different timescales of the protostar ( @xmath7days ) and the collapsing cloud ( @xmath4yr ) make it difficult to calculate the cloud evolution for the long period until a mature disk forms . to resolve this issue , the sink cell approach is usually adopted . with this approach",
    ", the region around a protostar is masked by sink cells , and a high - density gas , which has a shorter dynamical timescale , is removed from the computational domain and added to the protostellar mass .",
    "although we do not know whether the sink cell treatment gives the correct answer for disk formation , we have tentatively investigated disk formation with it .",
    "recent studies of disk formation in the collapsing cloud pointed out that the excessive angular momentum near the protostar is transferred by magnetic braking , and disk formation is strongly suppressed , at least during the early phase of star formation . using two - dimensional ideal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) calculations with sink a radius of @xmath8au , @xcite showed that disk formation is suppressed by magnetic braking even when the initial cloud is weakly magnetized with @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the dimensionless mass - to - flux ratio in units of the critical value @xmath11 and is frequently used as an indicator of cloud magnetisation . using three - dimensional ideal mhd calculations ,",
    "@xcite investigated high - mass star formation in a massive cloud and showed that the circumstellar disk forms only with @xmath12 ; they adopted a the sink accretion radius of @xmath13au and sink threshold density of @xmath14g@xmath15 ( or @xmath16 ) .",
    "however , these studies may overestimate the effects of the magnetic field or the efficiency of magnetic braking , because in reality , the magnetic field dissipates in the high - density gas region ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "considering magnetic dissipation by ambipolar diffusion and ohmic dissipation ( and the hall effect ) , @xcite investigated disk formation using two - dimensional calculations with a sink radius of @xmath8au ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "they claimed that magnetic dissipation can not drastically assist disk formation , and thus a rotation - supported disk never forms with @xmath9 .",
    "these studies suggested that magnetic braking severely suppresses disk formation in the early phase of star formation .",
    "however , only a massive infalling envelope can brake the circumstellar disk , and the angular momentum transferred by magnetic braking is stored in the infalling envelope .",
    "thus , magnetic braking gradually becomes ineffective as the infalling envelope dissipates .",
    "in addition , the infalling envelope finally falls onto the centre of the cloud , and the falling gas brings the angular momentum into the circumstellar region .",
    "therefore , a rotation supported - disk is expected to appear as the mass of the infalling envelope decreases .",
    "using three - dimensional resistive mhd calculations with a sink radius of @xmath17au and threshold density of @xmath18 , @xcite investigated the evolution of a cloud with a finite envelope mass and showed that a sufficiently large rotation - supported disk can form in the later main accretion phase even when the initial cloud is strongly magnetized with @xmath19 .",
    "in addition to the effect of the infalling envelope , the initial configuration of the magnetic field lines and rotation axis may affect disk formation .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite assumed the initial magnetic field lines parallel to the initial rotation axis . on the other hand , @xcite and @xcite adopted magnetic field lines not parallel to the cloud rotation axis as the initial state .",
    "they calculated the evolution of such a cloud without a sink but with a spatial resolution of @xmath20au and found that a circumstellar disk can form in the cloud with @xmath21 even without magnetic dissipation ( i.e. the ideal mhd limit ) .    at the expense of the spatial resolution around the protostar",
    ", many studies realized the long - term evolution of a collapsing cloud with a relatively large sink radius ( @xmath22au or a coarser spatial resolution of @xmath23au ) .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite and @xcite investigated disk formation with a much smaller sink radius of @xmath24au with two - dimensional simulations including magnetic dissipation .",
    "they showed that a low - mass disk with a radius of @xmath25au forms just after protostar formation because magnetic dissipation reduces magnetic braking around the protostar .",
    "they also pointed out that a disk @xmath0au in size remains during the main accretion phase even in a strongly magnetized cloud of @xmath26 ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it seems that each study reported different outcomes of disk formation .",
    "for example , @xcite claimed that a circumstellar disk forms only in a very weakly magnetized cloud of @xmath27 , whereas @xcite showed that a rotation - supported disk forms even in a cloud with @xmath28 . these different results may be caused by different initial settings and sink treatment .",
    "in addition , different cloud parameters such as the cloud mass , radius and magnetic field distribution should affect disk formation . in this study , we investigate the effect of the initial conditions and sink treatment on disk formation , by calculating 24 models with different initial conditions and sink properties . to limit the number of calculation models ,",
    "we adopt only ohmic dissipation as the magnetic dissipation process .",
    "ohmic dissipation becomes effective only in a high - density gas region .",
    "thus , our calculation imposes very severe limitations on the disk formation because other processes ( ambipolar diffusion and the hall effect ) support disk formation in a lower - density gas region .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . the numerical settings and initial conditions",
    "are described in  2 .",
    "the calculation results are given in  3 .",
    "we discuss the effect of the initial conditions and sink treatment on disk formation in  4 and summarize the disk formation process in  5 .",
    "starting from a prestellar cloud core , we calculate the cloud evolution for a longer duration after protostar formation to investigate the formation of a circumstellar disk during the main accretion phase . to cover the very different spatial scales of the prestellar cloud core ( @xmath29au ) and circumstellar disk ( @xmath30au ) , we use a nested grid composed of rectangular grids with the same number of cells ( i , j , k ) = ( 64 , 64 , 32 ) , in which mirror symmetry with respect to the @xmath31 plane is imposed ( for the details of the nested grid method , see @xcite ) .    we construct four different initial clouds having different density distributions ( for details , see  [ sec : initial ] ) and calculate the evolution of each cloud with the ( resistive ) mhd equations ( see eqs .",

    ", we prepare 5  9 grid levels at the beginning ; the initial cloud is immersed in the fifth level in all the models .",
    "the grid size and cell width are halved with each increment in the grid level @xmath32 . to reduce the effect of the reflection of alfv@xmath33n waves at the boundary",
    ", we impose the computational boundary at about 6  16 times the initial cloud radius @xcite .",
    "thus , the @xmath34 grid has a box size of @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the initial cloud radius .",
    "a low - density interstellar gas with a density of @xmath37 is set outside the initial cloud .",
    "we impose gravity ( both gas self - gravity and protostellar gravity ) only inside the star forming cloud core ( i.e. the region of @xmath38 ) .",
    "thus , only the gas at @xmath38 collapses toward the centre of the cloud .",
    "after the calculation starts , a new finer grid is dynamically generated at the centre of the collapsing cloud , and the truelove condition @xcite is satisfied , in which the jeans length is resolved in at least eight cells .",

    "are introduced and the high - density gas is removed from the computational domain ( for details , see  [ sec : sink ] ) .",
    "because the maximum grid level and the physical size of the first grid level differ for each model , we describe them in  [ sec : results ] in more detail .    for all calculation models , instead of solving the energy equation",

    "equations  ( [ eq : eos ] ) and ( [ eq : xe ] ) are not adequate in the high - density gas region of @xmath55 @xcite .",

    "the ( negative ) radial and azimuthal velocities for models rs1  rs4 at the same epochs as in figures  [ fig:14 ] and [ fig:15 ] are plotted in figure  [ fig:16 ] ; the keplerian velocity for @xmath231 is also plotted .",
    "both the radial and azimuthal velocities drop at @xmath1au in model rs1 , which has a sink accretion radius of @xmath232au .",
    "the velocity distribution in model rs1 differs considerably from those in the other models .",
    "in particular , the drop in the azimuthal velocity indicates an artificial effect of the larger accretion radius .",
    "it is very difficult to estimate the mechanism of angular momentum transfer in a magnetized collapsing cloud .",
    "however , the difference between the models without ohmic dissipation ( rs1 and rs2 ) implies that the angular momentum is artificially removed from the computational domain with a lower spatial resolution .",
    "the figure also indicates that the disks in models rs3 and rs4 are supported by rotation because the azimuthal velocity is comparable to or exceeds the keplerian velocity in the range of 3au @xmath233 20au .",
    "in addition , a smaller sink accretion radius and higher threshold density form a larger disk : the disk sizes in models rs3 and rs4 are @xmath0au and @xmath234au , respectively , when the protostellar mass reaches @xmath235 . as a result , we have to carefully introduce the sink even in a massive star - forming cloud .",
    "as described in  [ sec : results ] , different sink treatments yield qualitatively different outcomes even when the same initial conditions are adopted",
    ". a disk can form with both a smaller sink accretion radius and a higher threshold density , whereas no disk appears with a larger sink accretion radius . furthermore , different spatial resolutions seem to affect disk formation . to investigate the effect of the spatial resolution on disk formation ,",
    "we prepared the same initial cloud as in models us1  us8 .",
    "then , we calculated its evolution while changing the finest spatial resolution .",
    "we call the model described in this subsection the low - resolution model ( model usl , see table  [ table:1 ] ) . for this model",
    ", we imposed the same sink properties as for model us3 ( @xmath8au and a variable threshold density ) .",
    "however , different resolutions of the finest grid ( or different levels of the maximum grid ) were adopted .",
    "model us3 has a spatial resolution of @xmath128au ( table  [ table:1 ] ) , whereas the low - resolution model has @xmath236au .",
    "thus , around the centre of the collapsing cloud , the low - resolution model has four times coarser spatial resolution than model us3 .",
    "figure  [ fig:17 ] shows the density and velocity distributions on the equatorial plane for the low - resolution model .",
    "non - axisymmetric equatorial outflow and four cavities appear .",
    "almost the same features are confirmed in some models of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in addition , model rj1 shows the same features as shown in figure  [ fig:11]_a_. this structure is thought to be caused by numerical reconnection @xcite or interchange instability @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that numerical ( or artificial ) reconnection suppresses disk formation during the early accretion phase .",
    "because exploring this process is outside of the scope of this paper , we do not comment further on the mechanism .",
    "however , we stress that a slight difference in the spatial resolution can make a great difference in the outcome .    in both us3 and the low - resolution model ,",
    "no disk forms before the end of the calculation . however , gas flows into the protostar , maintaining axisymmetry in model us3 , as shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] , whereas a complex structure appears in the low - resolution model .",
    "it is natural that numerical reconnection tends to occur with a lower spatial resolution .",
    "instead , interchange instability physically occurs in the collapsing cloud and may suppress disk formation . moreover , in the same initial cloud , the disk forms with a much higher spatial resolution of @xmath237 ( models us7 and us8 ) .",
    "it is expected that the disk can alleviate the conditions of interchange instability because the magnetic field is gradually distributed over the disk , not concentrated onto the sink .",
    "we need further careful calculations to understand the conditions for disk formation , and the relation between the numerical resolution and reconnection and interchange instability .",
    "in addition to the spatial resolution and inner boundary condition ( or sink condition ) , the outer boundary condition should affect disk formation .",
    "the gas above and below the disk is connected to the disk through the magnetic field lines and can brake the disk .",
    "thus , the outer boundary condition is very important for correct calculation of disk formation because the boundary matter can slow the disk rotation .",
    "the angular momentum transferred by magnetic braking is stored in the infalling envelope when the star - forming cloud is assumed to be isolated in a very low - density interstellar medium .",
    "the stored angular momentum finally falls onto the centre of the collapsing cloud and forms a rotating disk .",
    "when the outflow appears near the protostar , it can escape from the star forming - cloud with an angular momentum .",
    "thus , only an outflow can really transfer the angular momentum into interstellar space .",
    "therefore , without angular momentum transfer by the outflow , the angular momentum should be conserved during the calculation or in the star - forming cloud , and a rotation supported disk forms as the infalling envelope dissipates .    to avoid the artificial effect of the outer boundary , we imposed it sufficiently far from the star - forming cloud , as described in ",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "however , we could not calculate the cloud evolution until almost all the infalling gas falls onto the centre of the cloud in this study because a high spatial resolution was adopted to investigate the effect of the inner boundary condition ( or sink ) .",
    "instead , @xcite showed that a sufficiently large disk forms in the later accretion phase even when only a small disk exists in the early main accretion phase . on the other hand ,",
    "a rotation - supported disk never forms even during the later main accretion phase in @xcite , in which the outflow also does not appear .",
    "the outer boundary was imposed just outside the star forming cloud in @xcite . in this case , the angular momentum can be artificially canceled out at the outer boundary , and disk formation is suppressed . moreover , if the mass inflows from the outer boundary , the infalling envelope never dissipates and continues to brake the disk through the magnetic field lines .",
    "disk formation is also artificially suppressed in this case .",
    "therefore , we have to impose the outer boundary ( or outer boundary condition ) very carefully to investigate disk formation .",
    "the calculation results seem to indicate that a finer spatial resolution is necessary for studying the formation process of the circumstellar disk . in principle",
    ", we should resolve the protostar itself to calculate disk formation because the disk forms near the protostar .",
    "the protostar has a size of @xmath6au and a number density of @xmath238 .",
    "thus , a calculation timestep of @xmath239yr ( @xmath240^{-1/2}$ ] ) is required with a spatial resolution of @xmath241au to resolve the protostar . with this shorter timestep or a finer spatial resolution",
    ", we can not calculate the evolution of the cloud and disk for a long duration after protostar formation .",
    "instead , the sink can drastically promote the calculation ( or time integration ) and make it possible to investigate disk formation during the main accretion phase . because the calculation timestep becomes longer with a larger sink accretion radius",
    ", we can calculate disk formation for a long duration with the sink .",
    "however , a sink having a larger accretion radius seems to give a misleading result , as described in  [ sec : results ] .",
    "thus , we should determine the necessary conditions for the sink to adequately resolve the disk .",
    "in other words , we should physically provide the sink accretion radius and/or threshold density to correctly calculate disk formation .",
    "resolving the first adiabatic core @xcite may provide a criterion for the sink for disk formation .",
    "to overview the evolution of the collapsing cloud , we calculated the cloud evolution until the central density reaches @xmath242 above which molecular hydrogen begins to dissociate and a protostar ( or a second core ) forms @xcite .",
    "because it is difficult to quantitatively compare the cloud evolution among models with rotation and a magnetic field , we prepared unmagnetized ( @xmath243@xmath10 g ) and non - rotating ( @xmath244s@xmath44 ) clouds that have the same initial density distributions as the models listed in table  [ table:1 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig:18 ] plots the density ( top panel ) and velocity ( bottom panel ) distributions against the distance from the centre of the cloud for the us , be , rj and rs models when the central density reaches @xmath245 , @xmath246 and @xmath247 , respectively , where the models have the same initial density distribution as in models us1  us8 ( us ) , be1 - be6 ( be ) , rj1 - rj4 ( rj ) and rs1  rs4 ( rs ) .",
    "although there are slight quantitative differences , the density and velocity distributions are qualitatively the same as those in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "before the central density reaches @xmath248 , the density distribution obeys @xmath249 in the outer envelope and @xmath250 in the inner region . when the central density reaches @xmath251 , a shock occurs and the first ( adiabatic ) core forms .",

    "the gas can collapse slowly even inside the first core as shown in figure  [ fig:19 ] , because the angular momentum is transferred by the magnetic field . however , a longer collapse timescale allows sufficient time for dissipation of the magnetic field . because the first core has a density of @xmath262 at its formation ( fig .",

    "although the size differences in the first core are not significant among the models , figure  [ fig:18 ] indicates that a higher spatial resolution is required for the uniform density models than for the other models .",

    "thus , to correctly calculate the first core and its subsequent evolution , we should investigate the cloud evolution using radiation mhd ( rmhd ) simulations .",
    "however , such calculations require huge cpu resources and it is very difficult to use them to investigate disk formation . instead of solving the energy equation and calculating the radiative transfer , previous studies used a barotropic equation of state to realize a long - term calculation possible @xcite .",

    "the difference in the sink conditions is expected to result from the size of the first core and/or initial distribution of the mass - to - flux ratio and specific angular momentum . although we could not determine the sink conditions for the uniform cloud , we may not need to pursue it because the host cloud for star formation is not uniform .",
    "instead , we may have to investigate the effects of the initial distribution of the mass - to - flux ratio and specific angular momentum on disk formation in future studies .",
