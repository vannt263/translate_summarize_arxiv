    "exact solutions of higher dimensional gravity and supergravity theories play a key role in the development of string theory . recently , a gdel - like exact solution of five - dimensional minimal supergravity having the maximum number of supersymmetries has been constructed  @xcite . as its four dimensional predecessor , discovered by gdel in 1949  @xcite , this solution possesses a large number of isometries .",
    "it can be lifted to higher dimensions and has recently been extensively studied as a background for string and m - theory , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the gdel - like five - dimensional solution found in @xcite is supported by an abelian gauge field .",
    "this gauge field has an additional chern - simons interaction and produces the stress - energy tensor of a pressureless perfect fluid . since a chern - simons term can also be added in three dimensions , it is a natural question to ask whether a gdel like solution exists in three - dimensional gravity coupled to a maxwell - chern - simons field .",
    "actually , there is a stronger motivation to look for this kind of solutions of three - dimensional gravity .",
    "the reason is that the original four - dimensional gdel spacetime is already effectively three dimensional , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the metric has as direct product structure @xmath0 where @xmath1 satisfies a purely three - dimensional einstein equation .",
    "the goal of this paper is twofold .",
    "on the one hand we will show that the three - dimensional factor @xmath1 of the gdel spacetime and its generalizations @xcite are exact solutions of the three - dimensional einstein - maxwell - chern - simon theory described by the action , @xmath2 . \\label{action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the stress - energy tensor of the perfect fluid will be fully generated by the gauge field @xmath3 , in complete analogy with the five - dimensional results reported in @xcite .    our second goal deals with gdel particles and black holes .",
    "within the five dimensional supergravity theory , rotating black hole solutions on the gdel background have been investigated in .",
    "it is then natural to ask whether the three - dimensional gdel spacetime @xmath1 can be generalized to include horizons .",
    "this is indeed the case and a general solution will be displayed .",
    "let us now briefly discuss the general structure of the stress - energy tensor of maxwell - chern - simons theory .",
    "the original gdel geometry is a solution of the einstein equations in the presence of a pressureless fluid with energy density @xmath4 and a negative cosmological constant @xmath5 such that @xmath6 .",
    "equivalently , it can be viewed as a homogeneous spacetime filled with a stiff fluid , that is , @xmath7 and vanishing cosmological constant .    in ( 2 + 1)-spacetime dimensions",
    ", an electromagnetic field can be the source of such a fluid .",
    "to see this it is convenient to write the stress - energy tensor in terms of the dual field @xmath8 , @xmath9 in any region where the field @xmath8 is timelike , the electromagnetic field behaves as a stiff fluid with @xmath10 if gdel s geometry is going to be a solution of the einstein - maxwell system , then @xmath11 must be a constant .",
    "moreover in comoving coordinates , in which @xmath12 , @xmath8 must be a constant vector pointing along the time coordinate .",
    "one can easily see that such a solution does not exist .",
    "in fact , the maxwell equations for this solution , @xmath13 imply in these coordinates that @xmath14}=0 $ ] which can not be achieved for gdel .",
    "if the electromagnetic field acquires a topological mass @xmath15 , however , maxwell s equations ( [ max ] ) will be modified by the addition of the term @xmath16 . in that case , the timelike , constant , electromagnetic field is , as we will see below , a solution of the coupled einstein - maxwell - chern - simons system , and the geometry is precisely that of gdel .    finally , we compute the conserved charges - mass , angular momentum and electric charge - for these solutions and derive the first laws for the three dimensional black holes , adapted to an observer at rest with respect to the electromagnetic fluid .",
    "we then show how to adapt this first law in order to compare with the one for ads black holes in the absence of the electromagnetic fluid .",
    "we start by reviewing the main properties , relevant to our discussion , of the four - dimensional gdel spacetimes @xcite .",
    "these metrics have a direct product structure @xmath17 with three - dimensional factor given by @xmath18 the original solution discovered by gdel corresponds to @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , it was pointed out in @xcite that the property of homogeneity and the causal structure of the gdel solution also hold for @xmath20 and @xmath21 independent , provided that @xmath22 , the limiting case @xmath23 corresponding to anti - de sitter space .",
    "the three - dimensional metric ( [ godel ] ) has 4 independent killing vectors , two obvious ones , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and two additional ones , @xmath26 which span the algebra @xmath27 .",
    "finally , the metric ( [ godel ] ) satisfies the three dimensional einstein equations , @xmath28 for all values of @xmath29 , and we see that @xmath20 plays the role of a negative cosmological constant .    note that a solution @xmath30 to einstein s equations in @xmath31 dimensions can be lifted to a solution in @xmath32 dimensions through the addition of a flat direction @xmath33 if the additional components of the stress - energy tensor are chosen as @xmath34 and @xmath35 . for the solutions , @xmath36 and vanishes , as it should , for the original gdel solution .",
    "our first goal is to prove that ( [ godel ] ) can be regarded as an exact solution to the equations of motion following from ( [ action ] ) .    to this end",
    ", we need to supplement ( [ godel ] ) with a suitable gauge field which will provide the stress - energy tensor ( right hand side of ( [ ee ] ) ) .",
    "consider a spherically symmetric gauge field in the gauge @xmath37 , @xmath38 inserting this ansatz for the gauge field into the equations of motion associated to the action ( [ action ] ) , and assuming that the metric takes the form ( [ godel ] ) , one indeed finds a solution for @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "moreover , the two parameters @xmath41 entering in ( [ godel ] ) become related to the coupling constants @xmath15 and @xmath42 as @xmath43 with this parameterization , the gdel sector is determined by @xmath44 , with @xmath45 corresponding to anti - de sitter space . for future convenience , we shall write the solution in terms of a new radial coordinate @xmath46 defined by @xmath47 explicitly , the metric and gauge field are given by , @xmath48d\\varphi^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & &   + \\left(2r+(\\alpha^2l^2 + 1){2r^2\\over l^2 } \\right)^{-1 } dr^2\\ , ,   \\label{godel2}\\\\ a   & = &   \\sqrt{\\alpha^2l^2 -1}\\ , { 2r \\over l}\\ , d\\varphi\\ ,",
    ". \\label{gauge2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from now on , we always write @xmath20 and @xmath21 in terms of @xmath15 and @xmath49 using ( [ trans ] ) .",
    "the general solution for @xmath50 involves the addition of arbitrary constant terms along @xmath51 and @xmath52 in ( [ gauge2 ] ) . at this stage , we choose the constant in @xmath39 to be zero .",
    "we will come back to this issue when we discuss black hole solutions below .",
    "a constant term in @xmath40 is not allowed , however , if one requires @xmath53 to be regular everywhere .",
    "indeed , near @xmath54 , the spacelike surfaces of ( [ godel2 ] ) are @xmath55 in polar coordinates , the radial coordinate @xmath46 in ( [ godel2 ] ) being the square root of a standard radial coordinate over @xmath55 , and thus @xmath40 must vanish at @xmath54 because the 1-form @xmath52 is not well defined there .",
    "the gauge field ( [ gauge2 ] ) is also invariant under the isometries of ( [ godel ] ) , up to suitable gauge transformations : for each killing vector @xmath56 there exists a function @xmath57 such that @xmath58 in this sense , the killing vectors @xmath56 of ( [ godel ] ) are lifted to gauge parameters @xmath59 that leave the full gravity plus gauge field solution invariant .",
    "the generalized gdel metric ( [ godel2 ] ) together with the gauge field ( [ gauge2 ] ) define a background for the action ( [ action ] ) with 4 linearly independent symmetries of this type .",
    "we shall now use these symmetries in order to find new solutions describing particles and black holes ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we have proven in the previous section that the gdel metric can be regarded as an exact solution to action ( [ action ] ) . the associated gauge field ( [ gauge2 ] ) is however real only in the range @xmath61 .",
    "we consider in this section the case @xmath62 and introduce particle - like objects on the background ( [ godel2 ] ) by means of spacetime identifications .",
    "identifications in three - dimensional gravity were first introduced by deser , jackiw and thooft @xcite and the resulting objects called  cosmons \" . in the presence of a topologically massive electromagnetic field , cosmons living in a gdel background",
    "may also be constructed along these lines .",
    "take the metric ( [ godel2 ] ) and make the following identification along the killing vectors @xmath63 and @xmath64 @xmath65 where @xmath66 are real constants .",
    "if @xmath67 this procedure will turn the spatial plane into a cone .",
    "the cosmon lives in the tip of this cone , and its mass is related to @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( see below ) .",
    "the time - helical structure given by @xmath69 will provide angular momentum .    to analyze the resulting geometry",
    "it is convenient to pass to a different set of coordinates , @xmath70 where the above identification amounts to @xmath71 also , the new time @xmath72 flows ahead smoothly , that is , it does not jump after encircling the particle . inserting these coordinates into ( [ godel2 ] ) , and erasing the primes , we find the new metric @xmath73 d\\varphi^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & &   + \\left ( ( \\alpha^2l^2 + 1){2r^2\\over l^2 } + 8g\\nu r - { { 4gj } \\over \\alpha}\\right)^{-1 } dr^2 .",

    "since under ( [ nc ] ) @xmath78 scales with @xmath68 while @xmath46 with @xmath79 we see that the @xmath46-dependent part of gauge field ( [ gauge2 ] ) is invariant under ( [ nc ] ) .",
    "however , the manifold now has a non - trivial cycle , and it is not regular at the point @xmath80 invariant under the action of the killing vector whose orbits are used for identifications .",
    "explicitly , @xmath81 which corresponds to @xmath54 before the shift of @xmath46 in .",
    "this means that one can now add a constant piece to @xmath40 .",
    "the new gauge field becomes @xmath82 the constant @xmath83 will be identified below as the electric charge of the particle sitting at @xmath54 .",
    "the metrics only admit the 2 killing vectors @xmath64 and @xmath84 .",
    "indeed , the other candidates @xmath85 and @xmath86 do not survive as they do not commute with the killing vector along which the identifications are made @xcite .",
    "so far we have only used the killing vectors @xmath87 and @xmath88 of ( [ godel ] ) to make identifications . besides these killing vectors , the metric ( [ godel ] ) has two other isometries defined by the vectors ( [ xi3 ] ) and ( [ xi4 ] ) , and one may consider identifications along them . we shall not explore this possibility in this paper .",
    "distinguished places of the geometry ( [ ds1 ] ) may appear on those points where either @xmath89 or @xmath90 vanishes .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath89 indicates that @xmath89 changes sign and hence closed timelike curves ( ctc ) appear . on the other hand ,",
    "the vanishing of @xmath90 indicates the presence of horizons , as can readily be seen by writting ( [ particles ] ) in adm form .",
    "the function @xmath89 in ( [ particles ] ) is an inverted parabola , and , it will have two zeros , say @xmath91 and @xmath92 whenever @xmath93 we must require this condition to be fulfilled in order to have a  normal \" region where @xmath84 is spacelike .",
    "the boundary of the normal region are two spacelike surfaces , the velocity of light surfaces ( vls ) at @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( assume @xmath96 ) .",
    "these surfaces are perfectly regular as long as @xmath97 there , which is indeed the case for the metric ( [ particles ] ) , when @xmath98 .    on the other hand , it is direct to see from ( [ particles ] ) that @xmath99 since @xmath89 is positive in the normal region , there are no horizons there and @xmath90 is positive in that region .",
    "this together with the fact that @xmath90 is the parabola of fig . [ pneg ] , means that , if any , both zeros of @xmath90 are on the same side of the normal region . the sides in which no zero of @xmath90 are present are analog to the gdel time machine , an unbounded region , free of singularities , where @xmath84 is timelike .",
    "if @xmath100 , the roots of @xmath90 are smaller than the roots of @xmath89 . without loss of generality , we can restrict ourselves to this case because the solutions parametrized by @xmath101 are related to those with @xmath102 by the change of coordinates @xmath103 , @xmath104 .",
    "the condition for `` would be horizons '' is @xmath105 as depicted in fig .",
    "[ pneg ] , once one reaches the largest root @xmath106 of @xmath90 , the manifold comes to an end .",
    "indeed , the signature of the metric changes as one passes @xmath107 .",

    "using then @xmath110 , with @xmath111 the smallest root of @xmath90 and @xmath112 , one finds near @xmath113 , @xmath114 this means that the spacetime has a naked singularity at @xmath113 , which is the analog of the one found in the spinning cosmon of @xcite .",
    "alternatively , as proposed originally in @xcite for the case where the would be horizon is inside the time machine , one can periodically identify time @xmath115 with period @xmath116 .",

    "[ godel ] that the metric ( [ godel ] ) can be embedded as an exact solution to the equations of motion derived from ( [ action ] ) .",

    "[ godel ] , the gauge field ( [ gauge2 ] ) represents the most general static spherically symmetric solution , given the metric ( [ godel ] ) ( or , in the new radial coordinate , ( [ godel2 ] ) ) .",

    "first of all , the intermediate step of making some coordinates complex is only a way to find a new solution . from now on , all coordinates @xmath129 are defined real , and , in that sense , the fields ( [ godel3 ] ) and ( [ gauge3 ] ) provide a new exact solution to the action ( [ action ] ) which is real in the range @xmath130 .",
    "second , in the original metric ( [ godel2 ] ) , the coordinate @xmath78 was constrained by the geometry to have the range @xmath131 .",
    "this is no longer the case in the metric ( [ godel3 ] ) .",
    "the 2-dimensional sub - manifold described by the coordinates @xmath132 does not have the geometry of @xmath55 near @xmath133 anymore ; the coordinate @xmath78 is thus not constrained to be compact , and in principle it should have the full range @xmath134 the reason that @xmath78 in ( [ godel3 ] ) is not constrained by the geometry is that the @xmath90 component of the metric ( [ godel3 ] ) changes sign as we approach @xmath54 .",
    "this is an indication of the presence of a horizon , although this surface is not yet compact .    finally , it is worth mentioning that the metrics ( [ godel3 ] ) and ( [ godel2 ] ) are real and are related by a coordinate transformation , so that all local invariants involving the metric alone have the same values .",
    "however , as solutions to the einstein - maxwell equations , they are inequivalent . indeed , the diffeomorphism and gauge invariant quantity @xmath135 changes sign when going from ( [ godel2])-([gauge2 ] ) to ( [ godel3])-([gauge3 ] ) .",
    "this is different from the pure anti - de sitter case where particles and black holes are obtained by identifications performed on the same background .",

    "@xmath76 according to @xmath144 again , these constants will be related below to the mass and the angular momentum and without loss of generality , we can limit ourselves to the case @xmath100 .    in the new coordinates ,",
    "the electromagnetic potential takes the form @xmath145 , where @xmath146 the constant @xmath83 is arbitrary because , once again , the nontrivial topology allows the addition of an arbitrary constant in @xmath40 .",
    "it is worth stressing that if @xmath78 was not compact , then @xmath68 and @xmath83 would be trivial constants .",
    "it also follows that the killing vectors of ( [ godel3 ] ) have the same form as those of ( [ godel2 ] ) , but with the trigonometric functions @xmath147 and @xmath148 replaced by hyperbolic ones .",
    "again , these vectors do not survive after the identifications .",
