    "rindler horizons provide an intriguing arena in which one can probe aspects of event horizons using simple accelerated probes in flat space - time .",
    "one such aspect concerns fulling - unruh radiation , which makes accelerated probes feel a thermal bath .",
    "while the temperature of this heat bath is relatively low in everyday situations , it has been suggested that large enough accelerations may be achievable in particle accelerators .",
    "the idea proposed in  @xcite is to use polarised _ electrons _ in a storage ring as thermometers .",
    "their depolarisation rate can then be used as a measure of the local temperature .    in the present paper",
    "we want to analyse , instead , the thermal effects of acceleration on _ mesons_. in order to describe mesons , we will use generic ideas from holographic models for gauge theories with matter .",
    "large - spin mesons are described in these models by long , rotating strings  @xcite which end on flavour branes  @xcite .",
    "they bend into the holographic direction , forming a u - like shape .",
    "the constituent masses of the quark and anti - quark map to the lengths of the string segments in the holographic direction . in the limit",
    "in which the constituent quark masses vanish , mesons are thus simply massless relativistic strings rotating at the position of the `` infrared wall '' or generalisations thereof .",
    "this massless limit is the one we will be considering here .    if we now accelerate this rotating string in one of the three space - like directions , a rindler horizon forms .",
    "the situation is then reminiscent of the analysis of rotating relativistic strings in holographic setups at finite temperature . in those setups",
    ", it is known that a horizon at some position in the _ holographic _ direction leads to the appearance of a maximum energy and spin , beyond which holographic mesons melt  @xcite . by analogy with those results",
    ", we expect that the acceleration of mesons in the three dimensional space - like directions , and the related rindler horizon which is now located entirely in the _ four - dimensional _ world , will also lead to a dissociation effect .",
    "our results indeed confirm this expectation .",
    "we find that spinning strings have an upper bound for their acceleration , which is set by the inverse square root of the angular momentum , . as spin - off",
    ", we also discuss an extension of this setup , in which the rindler horizon is used to model aspects of a holographic horizon , obtaining the velocity - dependence of the dissociation length as in  @xcite .",
    "in order to describe accelerated spinning strings , we will use a rindler coordinate system . a particle which experiences a constant acceleration in the  @xmath4 direction satisfies the equation of motion @xmath5 with  @xmath6 .",
    "solutions to this equation are given by hyperbolas , @xmath7 to describe accelerated motion , it is convenient to introduce rindler coordinates  @xmath8 which are adapted to these world - lines , in the sense that fixed-@xmath9 curves map to world - lines of constant acceleration @xmath10 .",
    "more precisely , the coordinate transformation is given by @xmath11 the metric then takes the form @xmath12 where we have added an additional two flat dimensions to accommodate the rotating strings which we intend to study .",
    "the coordinate system is once more summarised in figure  [ f : accel_coords ] .",
    "our strings will be described by the following ansatz in terms of the world - sheet coordinates  @xmath13 , @xmath14 the nambu - goto action for our rotating string now reads @xmath15 we will soon make the gauge choice  @xmath16 which simplifies this action further .",
    "the symbol @xmath3 denotes the string tension of qcd string . in the holographic framework ,",
    "this tension is related to the tension of the fundamental string via the warping factor in the metric in the radial ( holographic ) direction .",
    "our string will not move freely , following the action  , as we will also add an external force which acts on the endpoints and accelerates the string .",
    "the effect of the force will be described by imposing appropriate boundary conditions in the @xmath9-direction , as we will explain in more detail below .",
    "the ansatz   describes a string which accelerates in the direction _",
    "orthogonal _ to the rotation plane .",
    "it is of course also possible to accelerate the meson in a direction which is under an arbitrary angle with respect to this plane , or even in the plane of rotation .",
    "describing such a string configuration is far more involved as the component of angular momentum orthogonal to the acceleration is not conserved .",
    "however , we will argue at the end of the next section that acceleration in this case also leads to dissociation of the meson .",
    "there are two conserved charges which can be used to characterise the string .",
    "first , there is the angular momentum @xmath1 , associated to the rotation in @xmath17 direction , and second there is the boost charge , associated to the translations in the @xmath18-direction .",
    "the energy , ( associated with translations in the @xmath19-direction ) is not a conserved quantity , as the boundary conditions applied to the string endpoints break this symmetry , and lead to a constant increase of the string energy .",
    "explicitly , the angular momentum and boost are given by @xmath20 b & =   t_s \\int_{-l/2}^{j/2}\\!{\\rm d}\\sigma\\ , \\frac { ( - \\kappa^2 \\xi^2)\\big(1 +    ( \\xi')^2\\big)}{x(\\sigma ) } \\ , ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where  @xmath21 is defined as @xmath22",
    "in which the rotation takes place is suppressed.[f : accel_coords ] ]      the _ bulk _ equations of motion ( i.e.  ignoring the surface terms ) for the fields @xmath23 and @xmath9 which follow from the action   read    @xmath24 \\label{e : eomxi } - \\frac{{\\rm d}}{{\\rm d}\\sigma } \\big ( \\xi ' x(\\sigma)\\big )   + \\frac{\\xi \\kappa^2}{x(\\sigma ) } & = 0\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is easy to check that equations of motion for the other fields ( @xmath18 and @xmath17 ) are automatically satisfied with the ansatz ( [ ansz1 ] ) .    at the boundaries of the string",
    "there are additional terms which need to be taken into account .",
    "the external force acts only in the @xmath9-direction , while there are no forces in the other directions ; hence the surface terms for all fields except  @xmath9 have to vanish .",
    "the surface terms for the fields @xmath25 and @xmath18 are all proportional to @xmath21 , which allows for two possible boundary conditions ,    @xmath26    or @xmath27    the surface term for the field @xmath9 is @xmath28 we see that if we were to impose the second boundary condition  , the boundary term   for  @xmath9 would vanish automatically , which clearly does not describe an accelerated string with a force applied to its endpoints .",
    "hence , we choose the condition  @xmath29 which is essentially also the boundary condition imposed on the spinning string solutions of  @xcite .",
    "for this boundary condition , the product of the first two factors in   does not vanish . by adding an external force",
    ", we impose the dirichlet boundary condition  @xmath30 , which forces the endpoints to move with constant acceleration  @xmath31 .    after choosing the gauge  @xmath32 , the equation of motion",
    "can now be integrated once to give @xmath33 where  @xmath34 is an integration constant .",
    "inserting the definition of  @xmath21 we obtain the differential equation @xmath35 this can be integrated to give the solution @xmath36\\,,\\ ] ] where  @xmath37 is the second integration constant which will set to zero from now on ( without any loss of generality , as this just means that we choose the coordinate origin in the @xmath38  direction in a symmetric way , i.e.  such that corresponds to the tip of the u - shaped string ) .",
    "this solution also satisfies  , and in the limit  @xmath39 it reduces to the solution found in  @xcite .",
    "plane as it evolves in time , in an accelerated frame where the endpoint positions are fixed .",
    "the red ( bottom ) curve represents the shape at  .",
    "[ f : shape - string - xt ] ]    we now impose the boundary condition , i.e.  that , which fixes the length of the string in terms of the angular frequency and the constant  @xmath34 , @xmath40 using this relation to eliminate  @xmath41 from the solution , we find @xmath42\\,.\\ ] ] the total angular momentum for this solution reduces , after elimination of  @xmath41 , to the simple form @xmath43 while the boost charge does not seem to have a simple analytic expression .    in terms of the angular momentum ,",
    "the shape of the string in the ( @xmath44 ) plane is @xmath45\\,.\\ ] ] it is more intuitive to describe the shape of the string in the original minkowski coordinates @xmath46 @xmath47 + t^2 } \\ , .\\ ] ] this shape is plotted in figure  [ f : shape - string - xt ] .",
    "we see that the solution depends on minkowski time  @xmath19 , whereas it is stationary with respect to rindler time  @xmath18 . as time increases",
    ", we see that ( as expected ) all points approach the light - cone  @xmath48 .",
    "we also see that the string configuration   does not reduce to a straight , unaccelerated string configuration at the initial time  @xmath49 , but that the string is already bent at this moment .",
    "this is simply a consequence of the fact that we assume the acceleration to be present at all times ; a more realistic solution would start from a straight string , with an acceleration only for  @xmath50 , and would exhibit more complicated time dependence , though with qualitatively similar behaviour .",
    "let us now study the acceleration of the endpoints and see how it depends on the spin .",
    "the constant  @xmath34 in   is the acceleration of the midpoint of the string , and related to the acceleration of the string endpoints . evaluating   at  @xmath51 we find @xmath52\\,,\\ ] ] where we have defined the acceleration of the endpoints  @xmath0 .",
    "the acceleration is limited from above by the minimum of the right - hand side of   as a function of  @xmath34 . for a generic value of  @xmath0",
    "there are two solutions , one of which is presumably unstable  @xcite .",
    "the maximum of  @xmath0 is achieved for  @xmath53 , resulting in @xmath54 for this critical value of the acceleration the string world - sheet is still smooth , and all points move within the light - cone of the string endpoints . however , as we try to increase the acceleration beyond @xmath55 , the rigid u - shaped string solution ceases to exist . to determine the precise time evolution of this over - accelerated meson",
    ", one would need to consider a more general , time - dependent ansatz .",
    "however , a stability analysis of the critical string configuration along the lines of  @xcite makes it likely that this configuration is unstable , leading to a final point of dissociation given by two disconnected strings stretching all the way to the horizon , and each carrying a fraction of the angular momentum .    from",
    "we see that as expected , higher spin mesons are less stable , and dissociate at a smaller value of the acceleration .    to estimate what is the value of the critical acceleration for realistic mesons , we take the value of the string tension to be @xmath56 . in the holographic framework the description of mesons in terms of large rotating strings is , strictly speaking , only valid for values of angular momentum which are of the order @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the t  hooft coupling",
    ". it would be interesting to extend our analysis to the ( more realistic ) low spin meson sector , using a description in terms of probe - brane fluctuations , but we will present this analysis elsewhere . however , if we naively take the expression   and evaluate it for e.g.  @xmath59 and @xmath60 , we find for the critical acceleration the values @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively",
    ". it would be interesting to see if there is an experimental set up in which the critical acceleration could be observed .",
    "in particular , the decelerations of nucleons in the initial stage of a heavy ion collision is estimated to be of the order of up to a gev .",
    "although our computation is done for mesons rather than baryons , one may hope that a similar effect ( with a similar order of magnitude for the critical acceleration ) should hold for baryons as well , and hence may be relevant in describing the dynamics of the initial state of the collision of heavy ions .    as mentioned before , the analysis in the previous section ( the ansatz  ) and the value of the critical acceleration were derived by assuming that the string accelerates in a direction orthogonal to the rotation plane .",
    "the analysis of the equations of motion describing acceleration under an arbitrary angle is complicated and we will not attempt it here .",
    "however , in order to gain insight into what is happening in this case , one can consider a simplified configuration of a stretched string whose endpoints are accelerated in the direction of their relative separation ( with the same value of the acceleration ) . after a finite amount of lab time , the `` left '' endpoint of the string will cross the rindler horizon of the `` right '' endpoint , and hence they will loose causal contact .",
    "the lab time of the crossing is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the separation of the string endpoints in the lab frame .",
    "there is , trivially , a critical value of the acceleration , @xmath65 , for which the crossing time is zero .",
    "if we assume that the separation of the string endpoints originates from rotation , and we use  , the critical acceleration is @xmath66 .",
    "while the dependence on the string tension is dictated by dimensional arguments , it is interesting that this crude analysis still implies a dependence on the angular momentum as in  .",
    "hence , both longitudinal and transverse accelerations lead to string melting behaviour .",
    "we should note that in the computation above we have neglected any effects of bremsstrahlung , since in the large-@xmath67 limit in which our holographic computations are valid , the emission of strings is suppressed by the string coupling  @xmath68 .",
    "finally , our computation was done in the simplifying limit of vanishing constituent quark mass , although holographic models allow for a description of mesons with non - zero constituent quark masses .",
    "it would be interesting to extend our analysis to these more realistic string configurations , and in particular , investigate whether the inclusion of quark masses still leads to a universality of the critical acceleration  , independent of the supergravity background .",
    "it would also be interesting to analyse the combined effect of a rindler horizon in the four - dimensional space - time and a holographic horizon in the radial direction .",
    "we will leave this for future work .",
    "in this section we shift our point of view from the one presented in the previous sections , and use rindler space ( in the spirit of  @xcite ) as a simplified gravitational background , which will allow us to compute the velocity dependence of the dissociation length , as obtained in full - fledged holographic models in  @xcite .",
    "the direction @xmath9 is now interpreted as the holographic , fifth direction , and the acceleration in this direction is caused by the gravitational curvature in the holographic direction , rather than a genuine four - dimensional acceleration .",
    "we generalise the ansatz   to @xmath69 \\phi = \\omega\\tau\\,,\\quad y = v\\eta(\\tau)\\,.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 are directions on our 4-dimensional world , and @xmath9 is the holographic direction . note that the acceleration ( i.e.  finite temperature ) breaks lorentz invariance , which makes the boosted solution inequivalent to the unboosted one . starting from the ansatz  , the computation of the previous section is trivially extended to yield the string profile @xmath71\\ , , \\ ] ] while the relation between the angular momentum @xmath1 and the length  @xmath64 of the string in the @xmath23 direction is still given by  .",
    "the endpoints of the string are now forced to sit on the flavour d - brane , which is located at a fixed position  @xmath72 .",
    "this position is generically a function of the temperature of the background and of the constituent quark mass . on this flavour brane",
    ", the local speed of light is given by  @xmath73 .",
    "the constant @xmath34 is again related to the position of the midpoint of the string .",
    "in contrast to the situation in the previous section , where we minimised  @xmath74 as a function of  @xmath34 for fixed  @xmath1 , we thus now want to find the value of  @xmath34 which maximises  @xmath64 for fixed  @xmath75 . an expression for  @xmath64 is obtained by setting  @xmath76 in the @xmath77 analogue of   and solving for  @xmath64 , @xmath78\\,.\\ ] ] unfortunately , an analytic solution for the maximum of  @xmath64 for all values of the parameters  @xmath79 and @xmath9 seems out of reach .",
    "however , the regime in which  @xmath80 can be treated analytically .",
    "this regime also corresponds to  @xmath81 , and in this limit the value of  @xmath34 which maximises  @xmath64 is @xmath82 substituting this back into the expression for  @xmath64 and expanding for  @xmath83 leads to @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the temperature of the rindler horizon and @xmath86 is the ( local ) speed of light .",
    "this result indeed fits the full numerical solution for  @xmath87 ( see figure  [ small - big ] ) , although in contrast to  @xcite there is no agreement of this analytic result with a numerical solution in the small-@xmath79 regime .",
    "approximation.[small - big ] ]    moreover , the form of the expression is different from the one obtained in  @xcite and we also see that the result does not exhibit lorentz invariance . the reason for this difference is simple : standard holographic backgrounds at finite temperature all tend to asymptotically flat space , unlike the rindler background   which by construction describes only the near horizon geometry of the non - extremal brane .",
    "asymptotic flatness is a desired property of holographic backgrounds at finite temperature , since it corresponds to the restoration of lorentz invariance at energies which are much higher than the temperature .",
    "the metric   and hence the result for the maximal dissociation length   by construction do not describe this regime , but they do capture the behaviour of the system at energies which are smaller than or equal to the temperature . in this sense we work in a regime which is complementary to that of  @xcite .",
