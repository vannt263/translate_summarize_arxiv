    "it is well known that a pure @xmath1 gauge theory at high temperature undergoes a phase transition .",
    "this phase transition is of special interest because of many its aspects can be characterized precisely @xcite . in particular , the order parameter is given by the polyakov loop    @xmath2 \\,,\\ ] ]    where the trace is over the fundamental representation , @xmath3 is a periodic variable of period @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the temperature , @xmath6 is a gauge coupling constant , and @xmath7 is a vector potential in the time direction .",
    "the usual interpretation of is as a phase factor associated to the propagation of an infinitely heavy test quark in the fundamental representation of the gauge group .    until recently ,",
    "the lattice formulation , still struggling with limitations and system errors , and effective field theories were the main computational tools to deal with non - weakly coupled gauge theories .",
    "the polyakov loop was also intensively studied ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the situation changed drastically with the invention of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite that resumed interest in another tool , string theory .    in this note",
    "we continue a series of recent studies @xcite devoted to a search for an effective string description of pure gauge theories . in @xcite ,",
    "the model was presented for computing the heavy quark and multi - quark potentials at zero temperature .",
    "subsequent comparison @xcite with the available lattice data has made it clear that the model should be taken seriously .",
    "later , this model was extended to finite temperature .",
    "the results obtained for the spatial string tension @xcite and the thermodynamics @xcite are remarkably consistent with the lattice , too . as is known , qcd is a very rich theory supposed to describe the whole spectrum of strong interaction phenomena .",
    "the question naturally arises : how well does the model describe other aspects of quenched qcd ? here , we attempt to _ analytically _ evaluate the polyakov loop as an important step toward answering this question @xcite . in addition",
    ", a good motivation for this test is lattice data revealed recently by @xcite .    before proceeding to the detailed analysis ,",
    "let us set the basic framework .",
    "as in @xcite , we take the following ansatz for the five - dimensional background geometry    @xmath8    where @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is a deformation parameter whose value can be fixed from the critical temperature @xcite .",
    "we take a constant dilaton and discard other background fields .    in discussing the wilson and polyakov loops within the gauge / string duality @xcite , one first chooses a contour @xmath11 on a four - manifold which is the boundary of a five - dimensional manifold .",
    "next , one has to study fundamental strings on this manifold such that the string world - sheet has @xmath11 as its boundary . in the case of interest",
    ", @xmath11 is an interval between @xmath12 and @xmath4 on the @xmath3-axis .",
    "the expectation value of the polyakov loop is schematically given by the world - sheet path integral    @xmath13    where @xmath14 denotes a set of world - sheet fields .",
    "@xmath15 is a world - sheet action . in principle , the integral can be evaluated approximately in terms of minimal surfaces that obey the boundary conditions .",
    "the result is written as @xmath16 $ ] , where @xmath17 means a renormalized minimal area whose weight is @xmath18 .",
    "given the background metric , we can attempt to calculate the expectation value of the polyakov loop by using the nambu - goto action for @xmath15 in    @xmath19    here @xmath20 is the background metric . in the case of interest , this action describes a fundamental string stretched between the test quark on @xmath11 ( at @xmath21 ) and the horizon at @xmath22 .",
    "since we are interested in static configurations , we choose @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "this yields    @xmath25    where @xmath26 . a prime stands for a derivative with respect to @xmath27 .",
    "now it is easy to find the equation of motion for @xmath28    @xmath29'=0 \\,.\\ ] ]    it is obvious that eq . has a special solution @xmath30 that represents a straight string stretched between the boundary and the horizon .",
    "since this solution makes the dominant contribution , as seen from the integrand in , we wo nt dwell on other solutions here .",
    "having found the solution , we can now compute the corresponding minimal area . since the integral is divergent at @xmath21 due to the factor @xmath31 in the metric",
    ", we regularize it by imposing a cutoff @xmath32    @xmath33    subtracting the @xmath34 term ( quark mass ) and letting @xmath35 , we get a renormalized area @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a normalization constant which is scheme - dependent .",
    "next , we can perform the integral over @xmath27 .",
    "the result is    @xmath38    in this formula @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 @xcite .    combining the weight factor with the normalization constant as @xmath41 , we find    @xmath42 \\,,\\ ] ]    with @xmath43 the imaginary error function",
    "this is our main result .",
    "it is of great interest to compare the temperature dependence of with other results for the high temperature phase of @xmath1 gauge theory . in doing so , we start with lattice",
    "qcd . clearly , @xmath44 is of primary importance . in fig.1",
    "a comparison is shown with the recent data of @xcite .",
    "we see that our model is in a quite good agreement with the lattice for a broad temperature range @xmath45 .",
    "the maximum discrepancy occurred at @xmath46 is of order 15% .",
    "it rapidly decreases with temperature reaching 2% at @xmath47 and becoming almost negligible up to @xmath48 .",
    "then , it starts to grow back again .    for completeness , we can fit the value of @xmath49 to be @xmath50 that significantly improves         accuracy .",
    "for example , at @xmath46 it becomes of order 6% .",
    "one possible explanation for the better fit is that we have evaluated classically ( in terms of strings ) .",
    "if we take into account semi - classical corrections , then the value of @xmath49 gets renormalized .    for practical purposes , the expression looks somewhat awkward .",
    "following @xcite , we expand @xmath51 and @xmath52 in powers of @xmath53 . if we ignore all higher terms , then a final result can be written in two simple forms :    @xmath54 \\,,\\ ] ]    or @xmath55    in fig.2 we have plotted the results . as can be seen , above @xmath56",
    "the discrepancy between the expression and approximations         - is negligible . at lower t the approximation ( exponential law )",
    "it shows a significant deviation from the lattice .",
    "in particular , the discrepancy occurred at @xmath46 is of order 27% . on the other hand ,",
    "the agreement between the approximation ( power law ) and the lattice is spectacular .",
    "for the temperature range @xmath45 the power law provides a reliable approximation to lattice qcd with accuracy better than 5% !",
    "moreover , one can use it to describe all available lattice data of @xcite at lower @xmath5 .",
    "then , the maximum discrepancy occurred at the lowest available value @xmath57 is of order 7% .",
    "it is worth noting that the exponential law has been suggested in @xcite based on a dimension - two condensate @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "such a condensate as well as its possible links to the uv renormalon and @xmath59 corrections got intensively discussed in the qcd literature @xcite . as was first shown in @xcite ,",
    "the deformation parameter @xmath10 of the background geometry is tied into the appearance of the quadratic corrections .",
    "it is not , therefore , surprising that we have recovered in our calculations .",
    "interestingly , the power law is very similar to that observed for the pressure in @xcite .",
    "indeed , for @xmath60 the pressure is simply @xmath61 .",
    "in this note we have evaluated the polyakov loop using the now standard ideas motivated by gauge / string duality .",
    "a key point is the use of the background metric which is singled out by the earlier works @xcite .",
    "( note that there is no need for any free parameters except a scheme - dependent normalization constant @xmath62 . )",
    "the overall conclusion is that the same background metric results in a very satisfactory description of the polyakov loop as well .",
    "of course , we still have a lot more to learn before answering the question posed at the beginning of this note .",
