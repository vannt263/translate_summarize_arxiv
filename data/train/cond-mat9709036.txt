    "this is true in the presence @xcite and in the absence @xcite of attractive interactions .",

    ". a pure suspension of rods does not adsorb onto a hard wall , in the absence of significant van der waals attractions ; here we will assume that they are negligible . indeed , the density of rods near the wall is below the bulk density .",
    "however , the rods in a mixed suspension of rods and small nonadsorbing ( onto either the rods or the wall ) polymer coils do adsorb onto the wall .",
    "this adsorption is driven by the increase in the volume available to the polymer coils when a rod is near a wall , the so - called depletion forces @xcite .",
    "we find much stronger adsorption for rods than has been found for spheres @xcite .",
    "the depletion driven adsorption of spherical colloidal particles onto a wall has been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "these studies were primarily experimental but comparison was made with theories for depletion forces @xcite and qualitative agreement found . both the sphere and the wall exclude the centres of mass of the polymer coils from a volume which extends up to about the radius of gyration of the polymer away from the surface of the sphere or wall .",
    "this is true so long as the radius of gyration is not too much larger than the radius of the sphere @xcite .",
    "when a sphere approaches the wall , the volume the sphere excludes to the polymer and the volume the wall excludes to the polymer overlap .",
    "thus the total volume denied to the polymer coils goes down and so their translational entropy goes up . for polymer coils rather smaller than the spheres , free energies of adsorption of up to @xmath0 have been obtained @xcite .",

    "the results are consistent with those found here , as the rigidity of the polymer is increased , so does the adsorption .    in the following section we first derive the exact statistical mechanical expression for the density profile of rods near a wall , as a function of the polymer density .",

    "the interactions between polymer coils are neglected , i.e. , a fluid of just polymer coils is simply an ideal gas .",

    "the approximation is seen to be excellent near the peak in @xmath61 .",
    "the highest density of rods occurs only a little more than @xmath5 above the wall , where the overlap of the excluded volumes is largest and the orientations of a rod are very restricted .",
    "this finding provides support for the related approximations made in ref . @xcite . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] @xmath35 varies very little over the restricted range of orientations available to a rod close to the wall .",
    "this makes our approximation almost indistinguishable from the exact , numerical result at these heights .",
    "unlike spheres , the maximum in @xmath82 is not at @xmath83 . as @xmath40 decreases , the orientational freedom of the rod decreases , see eq .",
    "( [ rhoz0 ] ) . and",
    "this tends to counterbalance the depletion attraction of the rod for the wall . in the @xmath84",
    "limit the orientational freedom of a rod tends to 0 and so the density of rods tends to 0 .",
    "the approximation is much less good near the minimum in @xmath61 , which is to be expected as there the rods can rotate over a much larger angle .",

    "[ fig2 ] , @xmath35 is a minimum for @xmath68 .    from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] it is clear that , in the presence of polymer , long rods , @xmath85 , adsorb much more strongly onto a hard wall than do spheres . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the maximum density of spheres is only about twice that in the bulk .",
    "however , the density of rods reaches a maximum of over 20 times the bulk value . for even longer rods the density maximum increases exponentially and",
    "becomes very large .",
    "the larger density maxima correspond to free energies of adhesion to the wall which are many times @xmath86 ; rods much longer than @xmath85 will adhere to the wall effectively irreversibly .",
    "the sensitivity of the adsorption to the length of the rod is also notable at small lengths . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we see that , for this value of @xmath87 , the density of short , @xmath88 , rods is actually less than that of spheres . as rods , but not spheres , approach a wall they lose orientational entropy , which tends to reduce the density of the rods .",
    "thus , without polymer the density of rods but not of spheres is reduced near a wall , see eq .",
    "( [ rhoz0 ] ) . for long rods and high",
    "@xmath87 this is more than counterbalanced by the greater excluded volume of rods as compared to spheres . as @xmath87 is increased beyond the value of 0.2 the density of @xmath88 rods near the wall increases more rapidly than that of spheres , and eventually becomes larger than that of spheres .",
    "the dependence of the adsorption on the relative radii of the rod and of the polymer may be seen if figs .",

    "of course , although the volume fraction of polymer is the same in each case , the number density of the smaller polymer is 8 times that of the larger .",
    "if the polymer s radius is the same as that of the rod then for @xmath90 , which corresponds to a volume fraction of about 10% , the adsorption is very weak ; the density near the wall is always less than that in the bulk .",

    "@xmath52 our approximation is highly accurate as it is accurate where the density is highest .",
    "this is particularly so at high @xmath87 or @xmath3 , the density in the peak near the wall grows exponentially with increasing @xmath87 or @xmath3 , see eq .",
    "( [ rhoa ] ) .",
    "then the adsorption is dominated by this peak .",
    "it is obvious from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] that the adsorption of long rods is very strong , or equivalently that only small volume fractions of polymer are required to produce a layer of rods near the wall with a much higher density than the bulk .",
    "in a mixed suspension of rods and small polymer coils , the rods adsorb onto a hard wall in contact with the suspension . the adsorption is driven by depletion forces : the entropy of the polymer coils goes up when the rods lie close to and parallel to the wall . from figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] we see that the density of rods has a narrow peak , which implies that a monolayer is formed .",
    "this is expected as the depletion forces are short ranged .",
    "the rod feels the wall up to @xmath92 away but the interaction is only strong when the rod approaches to within @xmath93",
    ". only then is there strong overlap of the excluded volumes .",
    "this is reflected in the density profile . just at the surface",
    "there is a dense monolayer of rods lying parallel to the wall , then at larger separations the density of rods is actually below that of the bulk .",
    "the peak in the density is strongly dependent on @xmath3 ; longer rods adsorb strongly onto the wall .",
    "again this is unsurprising , the excluded volume and hence the potential increase in the entropy of the polymer coils increases linearly with the length of the rod .",
    "if we compare rods with spheres , we see that in the absence of polymer the density of rods but not of spheres drops as the wall is approached .",
    "this is due to the decrease in orientational freedom as a rod approaches a wall . in the presence of polymer",
    ", the larger excluded volume of a rod as compared with a sphere ( if they have the same radius ) causes the density of rods near the wall to increase more quickly than that of rods .",
    "the density of long rods becomes much higher near the wall than does the density of spheres .",
    "equation ( [ rho ] ) for the density has exactly the same form for a rod attracted to the wall by a direct rod ",
    "wall interaction .",
    "so , in the presence of any attraction with a range approximately equal to the diameter of the rod , the density profiles will be qualitatively the same as those of our figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "this applies to , for example , van der waals attractions @xcite .",
    "so far , we have only considered an ideal gas of rods adsorbing onto a wall .",
    "this was reduced to a simple one - particle problem which , of course , did not show a phase transition . although we will not perform any calculations which account for interactions between rods at the wall it is , perhaps , interesting to speculate on what will happen near the wall .",
    "we have seen that the density near the wall can become much higher than that in the bulk , particularly if @xmath78 is large .",
    "the density peak is narrow due to the short ranged attraction and so only a monolayer is formed .",
    "so , we expect a dense monolayer , which would resemble a system of 2-dimensional rods . for strong adsorption",
    "the density of this monolayer will be much higher than in the bulk .",
    "this immediately suggests that even at low bulk densities , i.e. , densities below a bulk transition to a nematic phase @xcite or between two fluid phases @xcite , the density of a monolayer just above the wall may be high enough for this monolayer to undergo a transition to a 2-dimensional nematic phase @xcite .",
    "we expect the surface layer to be in the nematic phase for densities @xmath52 of order @xmath94 and greater .",
