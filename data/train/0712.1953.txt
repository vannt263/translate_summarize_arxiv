    "decays of @xmath1 mesons into charmonium are the subject of much theoretical and experimental study .",
    "for example , the cp asymmetry of the decay @xmath2 provides a very high precision determination of the unitarity angle @xmath3 .",
    "this is a clean determination because in the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions the cp asymmetry does not depend on the decay rate .",
    "however , it is an interesting challenge in theoretical physics to determine from first principles the decay rate in the sm .",
    "doubtless this would shed light into the underlying qcd dynamics .",
    "we propose to construct an effective field theory that captures the essential dynamics of decays of a @xmath1 meson into charmonium plus light mesons .",
    "the theory we propose is a systematic expansion in small parameters and therefore the resulting approximations can be systematically improved .",
    "the building blocks of the effective theory are largely known : heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) to describe the @xmath4 quark in the decaying meson  @xcite , soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) to account for the energetic @xmath5 quark in the final state  @xcite , and non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) to describe the quark pair in the charmonium final state  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the main adaptation of these theories to our case involves re - formulating nrqcd covariantly in an arbitrary frame ( normally , nrqcd is formulated in the rest - frame of the charmonium state ) . the resulting effective theory , which we call covariant nrqcd ( cnrqcd ) accounts for the charm and anti - charm quark fields through four component spinors , to preserve covariance .",
    "we aim to show that the amplitudes for @xmath1 decay to charmonium factorize .",
    "what is meant by this is that the amplitude for @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a charmonium state and @xmath8 the light hadron , is the product of the amplitudes for @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 are quark currents .",
    "that is , the @xmath12 is given by the form factor of the current @xmath13 between @xmath1 and @xmath8 states times the decay constant of the @xmath7 state .",
    "there is a simple physical picture which suggests factorization .",
    "violations to factorization arise only if gluons are exchanged between the @xmath7 state and the @xmath1 or @xmath8 states .",
    "the effect of very energetic ( hard ) gluons affects the process at very short distances only , but will not affect the dynamical picture , so their effect can be absorbed into an overall constant coefficient .",
    "moreover , this constant is calculable since hard gluons are perturbative .",
    "the effect of low energy gluons , on the other hand , is non - perturbative .",
    "however , the @xmath7 is a very compact bound state . in a multi - pole expansion",
    ", a long wavelength gluon interacts with the @xmath7 color - charge distribution through it s color - dipole moment since the state is itself color neutral .",
    "but the dipole is very small because the @xmath7 is small . in the theoretical limit of very heavy charm",
    ", this coupling to the dipole vanishes .",
    "it should be noted that the weak interaction can also produce a charm - anti - charm pair with non - zero total color charge , in the octet configuration . the physical argument above indicates that in this configuration the quark pair does interact with soft gluons even at leading order .",
    "and while a color octet can not form a ( color neutral ) charmonium state , the emission of a soft gluon can in principle turn the pair into a color neutral state .",
    "it would then seem that this electroweak contribution to the amplitude for @xmath7 production in @xmath1 decays does not factorize .",
    "however , a long wavelength gluon interacting with a color octet leave the state in this octet configuration , and hence in a state which can not produce a physical charmonium state . as soon as the gluon wavelength is short enough to discern the quark - anti - quark nature of the octet",
    ", a transition to the color singlet state can occur .",
    "but this is suppressed by the perturbative coupling constant of short wavelength gluons , so factorization holds at leading order and is expected to break down at the first order in the small expansion parameters .",
    "while this physical argument is not a proof , it does capture the basic ingredients needed to construct a more formal argument . as we will see",
    ", it will be important to separate the gluon degrees of freedom according to the wavelengths and frequencies with which different particles interact .",
    "this is accomplished by using the effective theory approach , combining hqet , scet and cnrqcd .",
    "degrees of freedom that are left out in this classification produce what amount to short distance corrections , which can be absorbed into re - definitions of coupling coefficients . on the other hand , active degrees of freedom exhibit some simplifications , as for example spin symmetries , that are of paramount importance in the solution to the problem .",
    "there is a quite extensive literature on the theory of @xmath1 decays into charmonium . the naive factorization hypothesis in exclusive @xmath14 , with @xmath7 and @xmath8 denoting charmonium and strange states , respectively , has been tested against data , using models of the @xmath1 to @xmath15 form factor ; see , e.g. , refs .",
    "several theoretical approaches , distinct from ours , to factorization in qcd have been applied to exclusive @xmath1 decays to charmonium .",
    "these include `` perturbative qcd ''  @xcite ( pqcd ) and `` qcd factorization ''  @xcite . however , these approaches are not without trouble . ref .",
    "@xcite shows that in qcd factorization infrared divergences arising from nonfactorizable vertex corrections invalidate factorization . and",
    "the pqcd approach does not find factorization but rather computes the non - factorizable part .",
    "one may also attempt to formulate factorization for inclusive charmonium production in @xmath1 decays , as first proposed by bjorken  @xcite ( for semi - inclusive @xmath16 see  @xcite ) .",
    "this program was formulated more precisely in what is now also commonly known as nrqcd  @xcite .",
    "this formulation , however , does not address factorization of amplitudes but rather of decay rates .",
    "moreover , the program has run into difficulties as predictions of polarization of charmonium  @xcite have missed the experimental mark  @xcite .",
    "namely , the mechanism which resolves the factor of 30 discrepancy between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements of prompt @xmath17 production at the tevatron involves gluon fragmentation to a sub - leading fock component in the @xmath17 wave - function and yields 100% transversely aligned @xmath17 s to lowest order , which is not observed . the effective field theory approach presented in this paper",
    "may be used to study inclusive charmonium production in @xmath1 decays .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we discuss the kinematics of the decay @xmath18 and outline the effective theory used to derive the decay lagrangian . in section  [ sec:3 ]",
    "we list the degrees of freedom of the effective theory relevant in the leading logarithm approximation and give the feynman rules necessary to do one - loop calculations in the effective theory .",
    "also there we discuss the covariant modification of nrqcd .",
    "the effective theory electroweak lagrangian in the leading logarithm approximation and at the leading order in the effective theory power expansion is derived in section  [ sec:4 ] . in section  [ sec:5 ]",
    "the simple formal proof of the factorization of the decay amplitude in the leading logarithm approximation is presented . in section  [ sec:6 ]",
    "we perform the tree - level matching between the effective theory and full theory amplitudes with the soft ( c)nrqcd gluons included and discuss the possibility of factorization beyond the leading logarithms . in appendix  [ sec:11 ] the differential decay rate for the semi - inclusive decay @xmath0 is evaluated .",
    "the initial values of the wilson coefficients in the next - to - leading logarithm approximation at the matching scale of the decay are given in appendix  [ sec:12 ] .",
    "at the quark level the decay @xmath6 can be described as the @xmath4-quark decaying due to a weak interaction @xmath19-boson exchange into a @xmath20-pair and the @xmath5-quark .",

    "we will frequently refer to @xmath34 and @xmath35 as to the singlet and octet operators , respectively .",
    "the wilson coefficients @xmath36 depend on the scale @xmath37 which is of the order of the @xmath4-quark mass and contain the resummed leading qcd logarithms of the form @xmath38 to all orders in @xmath39 .",
    "currently they are known up to the nnlo in qcd @xcite in a different operator basis though .",
    "the details of the transformation between two operator bases can be found in @xcite and the exact definition of the evanescent operators involved in this transformation is given in appendix  [ sec:9 ] .",
    "here we give only the numerical values of the coefficients [ eft:7 ] c_i^nlo ( ) = c_i^(0 ) + c_i^(1 ) ( ) .",
    "we find for the basis  ( [ singloct ] ) at the nlo the central values @xmath40 and @xmath41 with the input values  @xcite : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 . it should be noted firstly , that the octet wilson coefficient is one order larger than that one for the singlet and secondly , that the nlo correction to the singlet wilson coefficient is roughly @xmath48 since at lo : @xmath49 ( whereas @xmath50 ) .",

    "this variation is mainly due to @xmath55 dependence which will be cancelled in physical observables once the matrix elements of the operators are calculated ( up to a higher order @xmath39 residual scale dependence ) .    finally , at the scale @xmath37 the decay amplitude is proportional to the matrix element @xmath56 in the following we will set up the kinematics of the underlying partonic decay @xmath26 in the full theory which will enable the construction of an effective theory in order to further investigate the structure of this matrix element .",
    "the wavelengths of the quarks participating in the decay are reasonably less than the wavelength associated with the confinement scale @xmath57 .",
    "the @xmath4-quark and the @xmath20-pair are considered to be heavy since their masses are roughly one order of magnitude and @xmath58 times larger than the confinement scale , respectively .",
    "the @xmath5-quark is very light but it is also very energetic in the restframe of the @xmath4-quark , so its wavelength is small .",
    "the numerical values of the quark masses are about @xmath59 the masses of @xmath4 and @xmath60 quarks quoted are obtained from continuum determinations in the @xmath61 scheme  @xcite .",
    "the mass of the @xmath5-quark is not relevant for our calculation .",
    "we will work in the @xmath4-quark restframe ( @xmath62 ) and decompose the momenta of the quarks accordingly .",
    "the @xmath4-quark momentum can be decomposed into ( omitting lorentz indices ) @xmath63 with the scaling of the four velocitiy @xmath64 and the residual momentum @xmath65 .",
    "we assume the @xmath20-pair to have a small relative velocity @xmath66 in their center of mass frame ( @xmath67 ) in order to form the @xmath20-bound state @xmath7 . in this kinematical configuration",
    "they are non - relativistic with a momentum scaling @xmath68 .",
    "this scaling persists also to an arbitrary boosted frame @xmath69 where the four veloctiy of the center of mass of the @xmath20-pair scales as @xmath70 , the perpendicular components as @xmath71 and the residual momenta @xmath72 . throughout the symbol @xmath73 will denote the relative velocity of the @xmath20-pair in their @xmath67 whereas four velocities are denoted by @xmath74 with @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the relative velocity @xmath73 of the quarks of the @xmath20-pair can be found from the self - consistency condition  @xcite : [ scale ] v=_s(m_c v),m_c = m_c(m_c)^4/_0 , where the first equation follows from the virial theorem applied to the ground state of the hydrogen - like atom : @xmath77 with @xmath78 is the reduced mass .",
    "the second of eqs .",
    "( [ scale ] ) is the lo expression for the running quark mass in qcd . for 5 flavors @xmath79 and @xmath80 gev .",
    "numerical solution of eqs .",
    "( [ scale ] ) gives : @xmath81 , @xmath82 gev , so that @xmath83 gev and @xmath84 gev .",
    "the relative velocity @xmath73 is not small although @xmath85 gev is close to the charmonium mass and @xmath86 is comparable to @xmath87 .",
    "since the effective theory is an expansion in powers of @xmath73 around @xmath88 , the process @xmath26 at the leading order in @xmath73-expansion is essentially a two - body decay and we can estimate the energy / momentum of the outgoing @xmath5-quark to be @xmath89 in the @xmath62 .",
    "then the energetic @xmath5-quark momentum can be decomposed as follows @xmath90 here the two vectors @xmath91 and @xmath92 with @xmath93 being a unit vector ( the components are given in the @xmath62 ) are light - like vectors , i.e. @xmath94 and @xmath95 . introducing @xmath96 and",
    "@xmath97 the momentum @xmath98 scales as @xmath99 with @xmath100 when @xmath101 is chosen to point approximately in the same direction as @xmath93 .",
    "so , the wavelengths of all quarks involved are reasonably large compared to @xmath87 except for the spectator quark . before the decay the spectator quark belongs to the @xmath1-meson and after the decay it must become the constituent quark of @xmath8 .    temporarily neglecting the spectator quark",
    "we will develop an effective theory for the matrix element  ( [ eft:1 ] ) in the limit where @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 .",
    "we keep the ratio @xmath105 finite , otherwise the above limits are taken independently .",
    "the latter means that to develop the effective theory for the decay we can simply combine the leading orders of hqet  ( see @xcite , @xcite , and  @xcite ) , nrqcd  @xcite , and scet  @xcite .",
