    "note that for reasons of symmetry , at a given round , all copies of a vertex in @xmath32 have the same color .",

    "the following table describes the evolution of @xmath25 .",

    "@xmath36    the table shows that at round 20 the entire system is white and therefore @xmath0 is a dynamo .",
    "the reader may go through the table by himself , but in order to facilitate the understanding of what happens in the table let us add some explanations as to the mechanism of `` conquest '' used in this graph .",
    "we say that round @xmath37 _ dominates _ round @xmath38 if @xmath39 .",
    "we shall make use of the following obvious fact :    [ monotony ] if round @xmath37 dominates round @xmath38 ( @xmath40 ) then round @xmath41 dominates round @xmath42 .    by applying this observation @xmath43 times",
    ", we find that if round @xmath37 dominates round @xmath38 then round @xmath44 dominates round @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) . by looking at the table",
    "one can see that in the graph @xmath25 round 2 dominates round 0 and thus we have    [ blinking ] round @xmath47 dominates round @xmath43 in @xmath25 for every @xmath48    we say that a vertex @xmath3 _ blinks _ at round @xmath4 if @xmath49 for every @xmath50 .",
    "we say that a vertex @xmath3 is _ conquered _ at round @xmath4 if @xmath51 for every @xmath50 .",
    "examining rounds @xmath52 to @xmath53 in the table and using corollary [ blinking ] one can see that @xmath54 and @xmath55 are conquered at round 0 , and in addition @xmath56 and @xmath33 are conquered at round 2 .",
    "furthermore , every vertex in @xmath25 blinks either at round 1 or at round 2 .",
    "finally , we have    [ tieconquer ] if at round @xmath4 a vertex @xmath3 in @xmath25 has at least half of its neighbors conquered then @xmath3 is conquered at round @xmath57 .    _",
    "proof : _ every vertex in @xmath25 blinks either at round 1 or at round 2 , and hence @xmath3 is white either at round @xmath6 or at round @xmath57 . from this round on ,",
    "at least half of the neighbors of @xmath3 are white , so @xmath3 will stay white .",
    "@xmath58    now the vertices will be conquered in the following order :    @xmath59 ,    @xmath60 ,    @xmath61 .    eventually , the entire graph is colored white .",
    "@xmath25 is a graph with @xmath62 vertices and @xmath0 is a dynamo of size 18 , proving theorem [ main ] .",
    "the result of section [ proofmain ] gives rise to the following questions :    does there exist an infinite graph with a finite dynamo ?    the answer is _",
    "no_. this follows from the following theorem :    if @xmath0 is finite then @xmath63 is finite for all @xmath64 . moreover , every vertex in @xmath63 has a finite degree .",
    "_ proof : _ the proof is by induction on @xmath4 . for @xmath65 the theorem is true because every vertex @xmath66 with an infinite degree becomes black at round 1 . for @xmath67 , if @xmath68 and @xmath3 has an infinite degree @xmath69 then by the induction hypotheses @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "hence @xmath72 and @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath73 has a finite degree then @xmath3 has a neighbor in @xmath74 . by the induction hypotheses",
    "only finitely many vertices have such a neighbor , and thus @xmath63 is finite .",
    "@xmath58    the next question deals with other models considered by peleg :    [ 2 g ] do we still have a dynamo of size o(1 ) if we change the rules of dealing with ties ? ( e.g.",
    "if a vertex becomes black whenever there is a tie . )",
    "the answer here is _",
    "yes_. if @xmath1 is a graph , introduce a new vertex @xmath75 for every @xmath8 and consider the graph @xmath76 where    @xmath77    and    @xmath78    if @xmath0 is a dynamo of @xmath79 according to the model in theorem [ main ] , then it is easy to prove that @xmath80 is a dynamo of @xmath81 .",
    "but all vertices of @xmath81 have odd degrees , and thus ties are not possible and @xmath82 is a dynamo of @xmath81 according to _ any _ rule of dealing with ties .",
    "therefore , for every @xmath83 the graph @xmath84 has a dynamo of size 36 .",
    "let @xmath85 be a real number . consider the following model , which will henceforth be called _ the @xmath86-model_. at every round , for every vertex @xmath3 with @xmath87 neighbors colored black and @xmath88 neighbors colored white , if @xmath89 then @xmath3 is colored white at the next round , otherwise it is black . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we will assume that @xmath86 is irrational and that there are no isolated vertices , so that @xmath90 is impossble .",
    "the most interesting question regarding this model is whether there exist graphs with o(1 ) dynamo like in theorem [ main ] .",
    "this question is as yet open .",
    "we only have some partial results , which can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "if @xmath86 is big enough then the size of a dynamo is @xmath91 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath86 is small enough then there exist graphs in which the size of a dynamo is @xmath92 .",
    "if there exist graphs with o(1 ) dynamo then the number of rounds needed until the entire system becomes white is @xmath93 .          for every @xmath96 ,",
    "let @xmath97 be the set of edges with one vertex in @xmath98 and the other not in @xmath98 .",
    "call @xmath99 .",
    "note that @xmath100 is the set of vertices which are white at both round 0 and round 1 .",
    "every @xmath101 is connected to at most @xmath102 vertices in @xmath103 and at most @xmath104 vertices outside of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore we have @xmath105      let @xmath4 be fixed . by definition @xmath107 .",
    "let @xmath108 , and let @xmath109 .",
    "more than @xmath110 of the neighbors of @xmath3 are white at round @xmath4 and more than @xmath110 of the neighbors of @xmath3 are white at round @xmath111 . thus more than @xmath112 of the neighbors of @xmath3 belong to @xmath98 .",
    "we therefore have @xmath113 which implies @xmath106 . by induction @xmath114 for all",
    "if we begin with a dynamo then for some finite @xmath115 we have @xmath116 and @xmath117 @xmath58",
    "let @xmath122 denote the sum of the degrees of the vertices in @xmath98 .",
    "recall that every @xmath101 is white at both round 0 and round 1 , and thus @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "therefore , @xmath125 .",
    "again , let @xmath4 be fixed , let @xmath126 be as in the proof of theorem [ rho3 ] and let @xmath109",
    ". more than @xmath127 of the neighbors of @xmath3 are white at round @xmath4 and more than @xmath127 of the neighbors of @xmath3 are white at round @xmath111 . thus more than @xmath128",
    "of the neighbors of @xmath3 belong to @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , we have                let @xmath136 be as defined in the answer to question [ 2 g ] .",
