    "the mixing of quarks in flavor and their organization into three generations is summarized by the complex cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm )  @xcite@xcite matrix .",
    "the components v@xmath1 describe the relative weak couplings between up and down type quarks . within the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "the parameters of this matrix are fundamental and have to be determined by experiment .",
    "the sm assumes the unitarity of the ckm matrix , which leaves us with nine parameters , four of which are fundamental : three real mixing angles and one imaginary phase .",
    "cp violation can , hence , only occur if this phase does not vanish .",
    "the orthogonality of the ckm matrix imposed by unitarity can be expressed geometrically as triangles in which the areas are proportional to the degree of cp violation .",
    "what is called the unitarity triangle is one of the six possible configurations , for which v@xmath2v@xmath3 + v@xmath4v@xmath5 + v@xmath6v@xmath7 = 0 and the side v@xmath4v@xmath5 is used to normalize the other sides .",
    "an explicit unitary parameterization that expands around the parameter @xmath8 was formulated by wolfenstein  @xcite and modified by buras  @xcite to attain exact unitarity and higher precision .",
    "direct angle measurements are hard , since they rely on rare b decay processes .",
    "the only accessible angle for the foreseeable future is @xmath9 for which the asymmetric b factories babar and belle have a measurement  @xcite that combined give a result of @xmath10=0.79@xmath110.1 , hence establishing a non - zero cp - violating phase .",
    "the length of the three sides of the unitarity triangle can be determined from non - cp - violating processes which can be used to extract cp violation indirectly .",
    "disagreement between the two methods would suggest new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "we expect an accurate measurement of @xmath10 by the b - factories in the next few years .",
    "therefore it is important to improve the accuracy of our knowledge of the length of the sides of the unitarity triangle as well , with the goal to maximize the sensitivity to new physics .",
    "our knowledge of the length of the sides is currently limited by the measurements of v@xmath0 , v@xmath12 ( see below ) , v@xmath6 , and v@xmath13 .",
    "the latter two can be extracted from b@xmath14 and b@xmath15 mixing  @xcite .",
    "the frequency of the oscillations yields in the b@xmath14 system @xmath16 and in the b@xmath15 system @xmath17 . to extract v@xmath6 and v@xmath13",
    "however one needs the knowledge of f@xmath18 and f@xmath19 , which can be computed by lattice qcd to about 20% with a result of    1.6 ) x 10@xmath20 .",
    "the measurements of v@xmath0 and v@xmath12 presented below are done with the cleo detector .",
    "the full cleo ii and cleo ii.v data samples containing 9.7 x 10@xmath21 @xmath22 events are used for all but the exclusive v@xmath0 analysis , which uses 3.3 x 10@xmath21 @xmath22 from cleo ii data only .",
    "the determination of of ckm matrix elements from exclusive semileptonic decays requires the knowledge of the semileptonic form factor that encapsulates the hadronic physics between the outgoing quarks .",
    "the extraction of v@xmath0 from b@xmath23l@xmath24 and b@xmath25l@xmath24 decays is difficult because of the small decay branching fractions and because it requires neutrino reconstruction . using only cleo ii data results in a statistical error of only 4% .",
    "the largest error contribution comes from the form - factor model uncertainty of 17% .",
    "the best measurement currently is : v@xmath0 = ( 3.25 @xmath11 0.30@xmath26 @xmath11 0.55@xmath27 ) x 10@xmath20  @xcite .    extracted from b@xmath28d@xmath29l@xmath24 decays , v@xmath12 can be determined more accurately since the semileptonic form factor for d@xmath29 at rest f(1 ) can be calculated to 4.6% using heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) .",
    "the analysis therefore measures the decay width in 10 bins : @xmath30 ^ 2g(w)\\ ] ] with @xmath31 = the d@xmath29 boost in the b rest frame separately for charged and neutral b decays . in each case 10",
    "@xmath32 bins are fitted for b@xmath28d@xmath29l@xmath24 , b@xmath28d@xmath33l@xmath24 , and several background hypotheses .",
    "the efficiency corrected @xmath34 distribution shown in figure  [ figvcbexcl ] is then fit to 1-@xmath35 and extrapolated to @xmath32 = 1 with results of @xmath36 = 1.51 @xmath11 0.09 @xmath11 0.21 and @xmath34 = ( 42.2 @xmath11 1.3 @xmath11 1.8 ) x 10@xmath20 .",
    "the lep experiments have a combined result  @xcite using a similar technique of 35.6 @xmath11 1.7,1 which is about 7% consistent with the cleo result .",
    "[ figvcbexcl ]",
    "hqet parameters extracted from b@xmath28 s@xmath37 decays and b@xmath28 x@xmath38l@xmath24 hadronic mass moments can be used to reduce the uncertainty in the theoretical prediction of the factor that relates the semileptonic decay width to the square of the ckm matrix element .",
    "inclusive observables can be written as double expansions in powers of @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we use an expansion in the pole mass  @xcite .",
    "the expansion parameters @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ( @xmath42 ) have to be determined experimentally .    the rare radiative penguin decay b@xmath28s@xmath37 is interesting because it is sensitive to physics beyond the sm ( charged higgs , ... ) .",
    "the newest cleo analysis takes the whole e@xmath45 spectrum from 2.0 to 2.7 gev into account , which leads to small model dependencies . since the background from continuum photons is two orders of magnitude larger than the signal , a large fraction of off resonance data is the key to this analysis .",
    "the @xmath22 background was estimated from monte carlo . from the spectrum shown in figure  [ figvcbexcl ] ,",
    "one extracts the following quantities  @xcite : @xmath46s@xmath47 = ( 3.19 @xmath11 0.43 @xmath11 0.27 ) x 10@xmath48 , @xmath49 = 2.346 @xmath11 0.032 @xmath11 0.011 gev , and @xmath50 = 0.0226 @xmath11 0.0066 @xmath11 0.0020 gev@xmath51 .",
    "the hadronic mass moments are extracted from a fit to the m@xmath52 = @xmath53 distribution .",
    "the moments are calculated relative to the spin - averaged d , d@xmath29 mass @xmath54  @xcite : @xmath55 = 0.251 @xmath11 0.066 gev@xmath51 and @xmath56 = 0.576 @xmath11 0.17 gev@xmath57 .",
    "these moments can be related to the hqet parameters such that one can extract @xmath58 = 0.35 @xmath11 0.08 @xmath11 0.10 gev and @xmath43 = -0.238 @xmath11 0.071 @xmath11 0.078 gev@xmath51 .",
    "@xmath44 = 0.128 gev@xmath51 can be extracted from the b , b@xmath29 mass difference .",
    "second moments are not used since the expansion converges slowly , which leads to large theoretical errors .",
    "the central values agree , however .",
    "[ fighqet ]      inclusive measurements assume quark - hadron duality , for which there is no consensus on the uncertainty . using the heavy quark expansion one extracts |v@xmath12| = ( 40.4 @xmath11 0.9@xmath59 @xmath11 0.5@xmath60 @xmath11 0.8@xmath61 ) x 10@xmath20  @xcite .",
    "it is important to note , that the same @xmath62 renormalization scheme and the same order were used for determination of the hqet parameter and the extraction of v@xmath12 .",
    "a check with a different scheme would be desirable .",
    "v@xmath0 is extracted from the inclusive lepton momentum spectrum in the endpoint region between 2.2 and 2.6 gev for the semileptonic decay channel b@xmath63 ( see figure  [ fighqet ] ) .",
    "the estimation of the fraction of b@xmath28u transitions in the chosen endpoint region relies on theoretical calculations that have serious model dependencies . assuming that the effects of the b quark motion are the same for all `` massless '' partons",
    ", one can use the b@xmath28s@xmath37 shape parameters to reduce the uncertainty in this fraction to 25% in the current analysis . after continuum and background suppression",
    "the b@xmath64 yield is subtracted and one extracts |v@xmath0| = ( 4.09 @xmath11 0.14 @xmath11 0.66 ) x 10@xmath20 .",
    "new inclusive measurements of v@xmath12 and v@xmath0 with an accuracy of 3.2% and 17% , respectively , were made possible by the usage of hqet parameters gained from b@xmath28s@xmath37 and b@xmath64 hadronic mass moment analyses .",
    "exclusive measurements , however , need accurate lattice qcd calculations of the semileptonic form factors . with new techniques and a validation from data planned to be taken with the cleo - c experiment",
    "such results can be expected within a few years ; see the talk `` exploring the charm sector with cleo - c '' in these proceedings .",
    "together with the expected @xmath10 measurement improvements , the precise measurements of the ckm matrix will test its unitarity and the verity of the sm .",
