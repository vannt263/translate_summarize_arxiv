    "grazing incidence fast atom diffraction ( gifad ) uses helium atoms at energies @xmath4 in the range from some hundreds of ev to some kev impinging at the surface under grazing incidence angles @xmath5 .",
    "the full diffraction pattern can be then recorded with high efficiency on a position sensitive detector .",
    "the grazing incidence conditions correspond to the very different regimes of the projectile motion parallel and perpendicular to the surface which typically can be treated separately .",
    "the motion parallel to the surface is fast leading merely to the averaging of the projectile - surface interaction potential along trajectory .",
    "the diffraction is associated with slow motion perpendicular to the surface which corresponds to the projectile energy @xmath6 in the sub - ev range .",
    "indeed , the corresponding wavelength @xmath7 is in the   range of the interatomic distances at the surface ( @xmath8 is the projectile mass ) . for further insights on the physics behind gifad we address the reader to refs .",

    "one of the advantages of gifad over has @xcitein that diffraction is preserved even at high substrate temperatures . in has the fraction of coherent scattering @xmath9 is described by the debye waller factor dw , @xmath10 with @xmath11 often forcing experiments to be performed on surface cooled at liquid nitrogen temperature . in gifad , the momentum transfer needed for specular reflection @xmath12 is spread over n successive atoms of the surface so that the effective thermal amplitude is @xmath13 and the effective debye waller factor is",
    "now n times smaller @xmath14 giving rise to a much larger coherence ratio @xcite!!. this explains that both larger perpendicular energies and higher surface temperatures can be studied in gifad .",
    "another specificity of gifad is that only one laue circle is typically observed@xcite just as if the surface consists of translation - invariant furrows @xcite ( see fig.[gifad ] ) .",
    "finally , since the interaction reflecting the helium atom from the surface is comparable to that repelling the tip of an afm , gifad can be interpreted in simple topological terms . in this respect",
    "it can be metaphorically seen as an afm operating in the k - space .",

    "the gifad setup is based on a conventional vg ex05 hot filament ion source .",
    "the @xmath15 ion beam extracted from the source enters a charge exchange cell filled with helium where @xmath16% of the ions are neutralised by resonant electron capture .",
    "the ions that survived the neutralisation are deflected , and the resulting atom beam is collimated by two sets of diaphragms half a meter apart which also allow an efficient differential pumping .",
    "these diaphragms might limit the angular divergence of the beam down to the @xmath17 range , however in price of loss of beam intensity .",
    "the detector is made of one or two microchannel plate electron multipliers facing a phosphor screen which is imaged by a ccd camera .",
    "the gifad source was attached to the mbe chamber by flexible bellows , and could be `` rocked '' mechanically using automated motors to vary the incidence angle of the beam on the surface .",
    "overall the use of gifad is comparable to that of rheed , with a highly ordered 2d surface giving rise to bright spots centered on the laue circle . in gifad",
    "these spots inherit the profile as the incident beam .",

    "the diffraction order @xmath32 corresponds to the change of the projectile momentum projection on @xmath30-axis , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the reciprocal lattice vector associated with the period of the structure @xmath35 in the @xmath30-direction ( see fig .  [ 6_pts ] ) .",

    "the same pattern also appears every four diffraction orders but in opposition indicating a contribution of points separated by @xmath40 .",
    "the fact that every fourth diffraction order is almost dark suggests that these points separated by @xmath41 have the same @xmath28 value so that their contributions add up every @xmath42 and cancel exactly every @xmath43 diffraction orders ( @xmath44 is an integer ) whatever @xmath45 is : @xmath46 .",

    "this section is devoted to the behaviour of gifad during growth and is based on the recent paper by atkinson _",

    "highly resolved gifad images such as the one displayed in fig.[fig_raw ] require over a minute exposure time to achieve a good signal - to - noise ratio mainly due to limitations in the primary beam intensity .",

    "right : time evolution of the scattered intensity @xmath82 around the specular angle @xmath83 ( blue line in the bottom ) and at an effective angle twice larger ( top red curve ) .",
    "as the intensity drops around the laue circle , it increases at large scattering angle.,width=302 ]    oscillations in the gifad scattered intensity during layer - by - layer growth are shown in fig . [ i_sur_i0 ] .",
    "these have the same period and overall shape as rheed oscillations carried out under the same conditions . however , unlike rheed , due to the absence of penetration the phase of these oscillations is exactly the same whatever the diffraction order , whatever the angle of incidence or the crystal direction of the incident beam@xcite .",
    "this lead us to associate the gifad oscillations to the variations of the surface reflectivity .",
    "when the helium beam impinges on a large flat terrace the reflectivity is close to @xmath84 but when obstacles are present along the helium trajectory , these atoms tends to be deflected to over specular scattering angles @xcite .",
    "there is no penetration of the relatively low energy helium atoms below the topmost layer therefore there are no interference effects which could alter the simple oscillations of the reflectivity .",
    "a maximum in the specular gifad scattered signal therefore will always correspond to the completion of a layer for true layer - by - layer growth .",
    "the detector records polar scattering angles up to @xmath85 , which is a significant fraction of the scattering pattern . to some extend",
    ", it is therefore possible to track how the missing intensity on the laue circle is distributed .",
    "this was already illustrated in specific 2d color plots in ref .",
    "we present here a point of view in terms of an integrated scattering angle distribution @xmath86 and the time evolution of its first three statistical moments ; the integrated intensity @xmath87 , the mean value @xmath88 and the width @xmath89 . as illustrated on the left of fig.[i_sur_i0 ] , the effective scattering angle @xmath90 associated with any point on the image is defined as the radius of the circle centered on the specular plane and intercepting the direct beam the points of interest . at the beginning of a new layer , the sudden drop in diffracted intensity is associated with a sudden apparition of scattering to super - specular angles .",
    "the figure [ i_sur_i0 ] shows that a factor two in effective scattering angle is enough to observe a complete reversal of the gifad oscillation .",
    "however , the intensity at half specular angle also tends to increase at the beginning of a layer , but overall the trend to larger angle dominates .",
    "this as illustrated in figure [ mi ] by the increase of the mean scattering angle @xmath88 .",
    "if both over and under specular intensities increase , then the width @xmath89 should be a reliable indicator of the growth .",
    "indeed , the figure [ mi ] shows that @xmath89 also oscillates with a nice triangular profile . since",
    ", the evaluation of @xmath89 is not expected to depend significantly on whether or not diffraction is observed , @xmath89 it is probably a robust way for counting the layers when the identification of the laue circle become problematic .",
    "are reported referred to their initial value ( before growth ) except for @xmath91 for which the specular angle is a more natural reference.,width=302 ]    the @xmath87 curve in figure [ mi ] corresponds to the intensity integrated on the whole detector .",
    "oscillations are still present but the triangular shape has disappeared . in fact , if all scattered particle would reach the detector , no oscillation should be present anymore in @xmath87 !",
    "this indicates that , at the minimum of the intensity oscillation , around one half of the helium projectiles do not reach the detector , probably deflected to scattering angle beyond the restricted zone that was selected to reduce the size of the data storage . in summary , both the intensity restricted around the laue circle as analyzed in @xcite and the width of the polar distribution are probably worth displaying to monitor of the growth .",
    "we now focus on the evolution of the elastic diffraction .",
    "its contribution , located on the laue circle , is comparatively easy to extract @xcite by interpolating the background located below and above the laue circle .",
    "the figure [ elastic_intensity ] , shows that the intensity of this component drops to zero at the beginning of a new layer before slowly recovering .",
    "this suggests that elastic diffraction is more demanding in terms of surface coherence length , it is more sensitive to defect than inelastic diffraction which is observed to decrease but with a little contribution surviving all along the growth",
    ". a simple interpretation could be that an atom can be elastically diffracted only if it probes a locally periodic surface , i.e. it does not encounter a defect . at variance , as long as the cumulated momentum spread induced by defect is smaller than a reciprocal lattice vector , the inelastic diffraction remains present",
    ". this could be the case if the projectile encounters defects located at few lattice units from its  trajectory \" .",
    "if the defect is closer producing a significant momentum transfer , the diffusion is likely to become completely incoherent and could possibly be modeled by classical scattering calculations .",
    "detailed analysis of these three rich scattering contributions elastic , inelastic and diffuse may provide an insight into the different length - scales involved in island nucleation and coalescence during layer - by - layer growth .",
    "we have demonstrated here that gifad is a technique which can be used to quantitatively test dft models of surface reconstructions and the he - surface interaction potential for highly corrugated and complex surface reconstructions .",
    "rocking curves together with a simple ray tracing analysis are also effective at rapidly confirming basic aspects of a surface reconstruction model .",
    "we have also shown that even for complex reconstructions , there exist surface channeling directions with very weak corrugation which can therefore be modeled with a simple fourier - like analysis - providing another means to check the surface reconstruction model .",
    "finally we have shown that gifad is effective at monitoring layer - by - layer growth and that deconvolution of the intensity oscillations into components corresponding to elastic , inelastic and diffuse scattering may lead to time resolved measurements of the mean distance between ad - atoms and provide new insights into island nucleation and coalescence .",
