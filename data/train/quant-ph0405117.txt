    "soon after the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , rich physical phenomena have been observed and predicted as well @xcite . in particular , there has been a surge of interest in the quantum tunneling dynamics of becs trapped in multiple wells , and much attention has been focused on josephson effect in such systems @xcite . on the other hand , it was shown that multi - particle entanglement can be generated in becs via the coherent interactions between the atoms @xcite , and thereafter becs have played a prominent role in the field of quantum information .",
    "for example , both multi - particle entanglement ( i.e. spin squeezing ) and two - mode entanglement can be generated in a spin-1 condensate with three hyperfine sublevels @xcite . in this case , two - mode entanglement , describing the inseparability between the two modes ( respectively with spin projection @xmath0 ) , can be used as quantum information protocols to facilitate quantum teleportation of continuous variables @xcite .    on the other hand , in addition to becs with spin 0 and 1 , becs with two internal degrees of freedom ,",
    "e.g. the @xmath1 and @xmath2 sublevels of @xmath3rb , are also achievable experimentally and are often termed as two - component condensates @xcite , which give rise to novel features such as phase separation @xcite and the cancellation of mean field energy shift @xcite .",
    "such condensates can be viewed as collections of interacting spin - half particles and can consequently display multi - particle entanglement through the emergence of spin squeezing @xcite .",
    "likewise , two different kinds of atoms ( e.g. @xmath4k and @xmath3rb ) can also form stable two - component becs @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , the interspecies interaction of these two - component becs can be varied by the application of magnetic control @xcite , thus hastening various experimental and theoretical investigations in this field .",
    "recently , there have been several discussions on the dynamics of a two - component condensate trapped in a double - well potential @xcite .",
    "the behaviors of such systems , which can be realized experimentally with the current technology , are arguably much richer than those of single - component condensates because of the interspecies interaction .",
    "for example , in a recent paper @xcite we studied the tunneling dynamics of a two - component condensate whose two components are initially separated by the potential barrier between a double - well .",
    "we found that in the strong scattering regime atoms in the two components can tunnel through the barrier in a correlated manner @xcite .",
    "as both the scattering strength and the tunneling strength between the wells can be tuned independently with various experimental techniques @xcite , it is expected that such phenomena will become observable in the near future .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a two - component condensate trapped in a double - well potential .",
    "both components of the condensate are initially prepared in the ground state of the double well and hence are separable at time @xmath5 .",
    "the objective of the present paper is to study and quantify the generation of two - mode entanglement in such a condensate .",
    "two - mode entanglement is commonly attributed to the inseparability of the density matrix describing two systems , which can be found in various experimental situations and is very useful in the applications of quantum measurement and quantum information @xcite .",
    "in fact , entanglement between two ensembles of atoms with spin has recently been achieved experimentally via interaction with polarized light @xcite , and the concept of two - mode entanglement has been generalized to describe such spin systems @xcite . since each component of a two - component condensate in a double - well can be described as a collection of spin - half particles , with the two spatially localized modes in the two wells playing respectively the roles of spin - up and spin - down states , the condensate is in fact equivalent to two interacting gigantic spins that can be described in terms of continuous variables @xcite .",
    "while it has been shown that the intra - species interaction is able to create spin - squeezing for a single - component condensate trapped a double - well potential @xcite , in this paper we will demonstrate that the inter - species interaction is responsible for the generation of two - mode entanglement .",
    "it is the intriguing interplay of the inter - species and the intra - species interactions that sparks our investigation in such systems . by applying the holstein - primakoff transformation ( hpt ) @xcite , which reduces this two - spin system to two coupled oscillators ,",
    "we show that our system is exactly solvable as long as the number of excitations due to atom - atom interactions remains low .",
    "more remarkably , the condensate in fact forms a symmetric gaussian system .",
    "therefore , we can directly evaluate the entanglement of formation ( i.e. the von - neumann entropy for a pure state ) of the system from the fluctuations in the quadratures of the two constituent components @xcite . in accordance with the schemes proposed recently by duan _",
    "_ @xcite and giedke _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , we define a two - mode entanglement parameter that measures the fluctuations in the quadratures and in turn analyze the degree of entanglement between the two components of the condensate in the present paper .",
    "our discovery is that strong interspecies interaction can lead to significant two - mode squeezing in the condensate and hence strong entanglement between the two components .",
    "the structure of our paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the hamiltonian of our system and classify it into symmetric and asymmetric cases according to the properties of the constituent condensates . in section iii , we consider specifically a system with a large number of atoms .",
    "an effective hamiltonian , which is exactly solvable , is then derived from the hpt . in section iv",
    ", we introduce the two - mode entanglement parameter @xcite to describe and quantify the entanglement in our system . in section",
    "v , we study in detail the two - mode entanglement parameter for several typical cases .",
    "finally , we discuss the physical meaning of the two - mode entanglement parameter in section vi and consider generalization our approach to mixed states .",
    "we first consider the tunneling dynamics of a two - component bec trapped in a symmetric double - well potential .",
    "the total number of atoms in components @xmath6 and @xmath7 of the condensate are @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "we will further assume that the interaction between the atoms is sufficiently weak and adopt the two - mode approximation to describe the tunneling process .",
    "under such approximation , the condensate dwelling in each potential minimum is adequately described by a single localized mode function @xcite . considering the effect of quantum tunneling and the conservation of the particle number of each component",
    ", we obtain the hamiltonian of the system : @xmath10 + \\frac{\\kappa_{b}}{2}\\left[({\\bl}\\hat{b}_{l})^{2}+({\\br}\\hat{b}_{r})^{2}\\right ] .",

    "since there are two spatial modes ( the @xmath17 and @xmath18 modes ) available for each component , the hamiltonian above in fact consists of four bosonic operators . besides , the parameters @xmath19(@xmath20 ) , @xmath21(@xmath22 ) and @xmath23 are the tunneling , intraspecies interaction strength of component @xmath6(@xmath7 ) and the interspecies interaction strength respectively .    for the convenience of the subsequent discussion of two - mode entanglement , it is instructive to represent this hamiltonian in terms of angular momentum operators by following through the standard schwinger oscillator model to construct a set of spin operators for each component @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 . here",

    "we will denote the eigenstates of @xmath27 and @xmath28 with @xmath29 such that @xmath30 , where @xmath31 . in terms of @xmath32 and @xmath33 ,",

    "we consider how the atom - atom interactions affect the evolution of the initial state @xmath36 and show that the two components will get entangled through the inter- and intra - species interactions .    to facilitate later discussion on the phenomenon of entanglement",
    ", we further classify two - component condensates according to the symmetry properties of the two components constituting the condensate . in a _",
    "symmetric _ two - component bec , the parameters of component @xmath6 and component @xmath7 are equal to one another , namely @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "these conditions hold approximately for condensates consisting of the hyperfine states @xmath1 and @xmath39 of @xmath3rb @xcite .",

    ", the distinguishability of the two species entails the study of two - mode entanglement .",
    "meanwhile , for _ asymmetric _ two - component becs relevant physical parameters of the two components are generally different .",
    "for example , it has recently been observed in the experiment that the condensates of potassium and rubidium ( rb - k ) , which have different scattering lengths and masses , can form stable two - component condensates @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is deemed appropriate to develop a generic analytical scheme to study such condensates . in the following discussion",
    ", we will make use of the hpt @xcite to carry out a thorough analytical investigation on the entanglement between the two constituent components .",
    "in this section , we consider the evolution of a condensate with large numbers of atoms and sufficiently weak scattering strengths , namely @xmath45 and @xmath46 . as the initial state , given by ( [ instate ] ) , is the ground state of a non - interacting condensate and the scattering strengths are weak , only the low - lying states will be excited in the evolution and the coherence of tunneling process can be maintained .",
    "the current situation is in contradistinction to our previous study @xcite that discovered correlated tunneling of the two components in the strong scattering regime .",
    "however , we will show that the inter - species interaction does lead to nontrivial entanglement of the two components .",
    "to proceed , we apply the hpt to map angular momentum operators into bosonic operators @xcite and show that under the hpt our system is in fact equivalent to two coupled harmonic oscillators . in hpt ,",

    "we express the solutions in matrix form , which reads @xmath64 here @xmath65 is a real @xmath66 matrix representing the evolution operator and can be written as @xmath67 with the @xmath68 matrices @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 being explicitly given by @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 and @xmath75 where @xmath76 and the normal mode frequencies of the coupled oscillation are @xmath77^{1/2}\\bigg\\}^{1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this approximate solution , which is based on hpt , is valid as long as the condition ( [ hpassumption ] ) holds .",
    "however , if the normal frequency is complex , the system will become unstable .",
    "we can therefore determine the stability condition from ( [ nmf ] ) : @xmath78 the hpt fails to yield a self - consistent solution for systems violating the inequality .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the limit where @xmath79 , the condition for stability reduces to : @xmath80 ) will lead to the phase separation of two component becs @xcite .",
    "it is also worthwhile to note that the stability criterion ( [ qsc ] ) depends on the numbers of atoms in the double - well and similar dependence has previously been found for two - component becs in a single well @xcite .",
    "we will , however , assume the stability criterion ( [ qsc ] ) is satisfied throughout the present study and obtain analytically the two - mode entanglement parameter for the condensate , which will be defined in the following section .",
    "we will see that in addition to yielding the analytic solution to the tunneling dynamics , the hpt performed here also facilitates our study on two - mode entanglement .",
    "entanglement between two systems that are described in terms of continuous variables is usually indicated by an inequality in its einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) uncertainty @xcite : @xmath81 ^ 2\\rangle+ \\langle[{\\delta}(\\hat{p}_{a}-\\hat{p}_{b})]^2\\rangle\\right\\}&<&1,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath82=i\\delta_{mn}$ ] for @xmath83 . @xmath84 and @xmath85 are respectively the position and momentum operators ( or any pairs of quadratures ) of system @xmath86 , and the above inequality simply implies that the positions ( momenta ) of the particles are strongly anti - correlated ( correlated ) . in general ,",
    "condition ( [ eprinequal ] ) is only a sufficient condition for entanglement and does not imply separability of the two systems even if it is violated @xcite . however , it has recently been shown that a necessary and sufficient condition for entanglement , which is analogous to ( [ eprinequal ] ) , can be established if the combined system is a gaussian one in the sense that if its wigner characteristic function , defined by : @xmath87 \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is a gaussian function of @xmath88 and @xmath89 @xcite . without loss of generality , one can assume that the expectation values of all quadratures vanish and hence the wigner characteristic function of a gaussian system is expressible as : @xmath90\\,\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is a @xmath92 real symmetric matrix and the matrix @xmath93 is defined by @xmath94 .",

    "in fact , @xmath97 and therefore @xmath91 is termed the covariance matrix .",
    "as the amount of entanglement between the two systems is unaffected by local unitary operations , say local rotations in the @xmath98-@xmath99 plane and local squeezing operations , the matrix @xmath91 can be transformed into a standard form @xmath100 by several local operations @xcite : @xmath101 where @xmath102 are positive numbers , and @xmath103 where @xmath104 we therefore accordingly construct a two - mode entanglement parameter @xmath105@xcite : @xmath106 physically speaking , @xmath107 is merely a suitably weighted epr - type uncertainty in the squeezed quadratures of the system .",
    "the sufficient and condition for entanglement mentioned above can then be expressed in terms of an inequality involving this parameter : @xmath108    if , in addition , the system is a symmetric one such that @xmath109 , giedke _ et al . _",

    "we also show the time evolution of the eof , which equals the von - neumann entropy in this case , by the dashed line in fig .",
    "it is obvious that our system is able to generate a substantial amount of two - mode entanglement for most of the time . besides",
    ", one can see that there is a strong anti - correlation between these two curves , which can be understood as @xmath128 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath105 for @xmath137 .",
    "it is remarkable that the degree of entanglement depends crucially on the inter - species interaction .",
    "of course , it is obvious that the eof or the entropy is zero when the interspecies interaction @xmath23 vanishes . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , the entanglement parameter @xmath105 decreases while the eof increases with increasing @xmath23 .",

    "physically speaking , the availability of the two spatially separated modes in fact stabilizes the condensate despite that @xmath139 @xcite .",
    "we now switch our attention to asymmetric becs consisting of two components with different physical characteristics .",
    "in fact , stable becs of rubidium and potassium have recently been achieved in experiments and it is also possible to control the strength of interspecies interaction between the two components with a magnetic field @xcite . it is therefore deemed appropriate to investigate how the entanglement in such condensates changes with the interspecies interaction strength , @xmath23 . in the following ,",
    "we assume that the tunneling strengths and the intraspecies interaction strengths of the two species are in the ratios of 1:1.45 and 1:1.33 respectively , which are reasonable estimates of experimental data for a rb - k condensate @xcite .",
    "the two - mode entanglement parameters for three asymmetric cases with @xmath140 are respectively shown in fig .",

    "the two - component condensates can be viewed as a coupled oscillators and at the critical point of stability the eigenfrequenices are @xmath141 and zero . as one of these frequencies , @xmath142 , is markedly different from those in the interaction free case , the effect of squeezing in the position space and the momentum space is much pronounced in the vicinity of the critical point .    to further elaborate this issue",
    ", we show the minimal value of @xmath105 during the evolution of the coupled condensates and the corresponding eof as functions of the interspecies interaction strength @xmath23 in fig [ fig3 ] , which explicitly confirms that the degree of entanglement increases drastically as the interspecies interaction @xmath23 is close to the stability limit given by ( [ qsc ] ) .",
    "in fact , both quantities change noticeably once @xmath143 .",
    "it is noteworthy that similar increase in entanglement has previously been found in quantum phase transition of a spin chain model @xcite .",
    "in the present paper the entanglement between the two components of a bec condensate trapped in a double - well is studied analytically in the low excitation limit with the hpt , and its accuracy is confirmed by comparison with the exact numerical solution .",
    "as demonstrated in previous sections , the degree of entanglement , gauged by the two - mode entanglement parameter , depends strongly on the interspecies interaction that can be varied with the current technology @xcite .",
    "we expect that our work can be applied to study entanglement in two - component condensates such as rb - rb and rb - k mixtures .",
    "specifically , our result shows that the two components of the condensate can remain in the tunneling phase and yet get strongly entangled as long as @xmath138 .    to gain more physical insight from our result",

    "on the other hand , in real experiments the temperature of the condensate is not exactly zero @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is worth studying how the effect of finite temperature might affect the entanglement that could be built up in the system during its evolution when the initial state is a mixed state .",

    "it is well known that the wigner characteristic function of a harmonic oscillator in a thermal mixed state is still a gaussian function @xcite .",
    "so , it is readily shown that the system considered in our paper remains in a gaussian state and one can use the two - mode entanglement parameter to study the entanglement between the condensates .",
    "following the argument outlined previously , one can show that the covariance matrix @xmath120 at @xmath162 is given by @xmath163 , from which the two - mode entanglement parameter @xmath105 can be obtained accordingly .",
    "in particular , for a symmetric two - component bec with @xmath37 , the covariance matrix @xmath120 is just @xmath164 multiplied by @xmath165 ( or equivalently @xmath166 ) and the system is again symmetric .",
    "the two - mode entanglement parameter @xmath105 can then be used to determine whether the system is entangled or not and to evaluate the entanglement of formation @xmath128 as well . in fig .",
    "@xmath167 we show the two - mode entanglement parameter @xmath105 and the entanglement of formation @xmath110 as functions of time for a symmetric two - component bec with the mean excitation number @xmath168 .",
    "it is clearly manifested that a substantial amount of entanglement can still be achievable when @xmath23 is sufficiently strong .",
    "therefore , the existence of finite thermal effects does not readily preclude the occurrence of entanglement .",
    "on the other hand , for an asymmetric two - component bec with @xmath169 , the covariance matrix @xmath120 is no longer symmetric with respect to the two interacting components .",
    "therefore , despite that one can still make use of the parameter @xmath105 to determine whether the system is entangled or not , it is no longer possible to apply the method developed here to obtain @xmath110 even if @xmath152 and other numerical schemes have to be sought @xcite .    in summary , although there might be some complications in quantifying the degree of entanglement if the initial state of the condensate is a mixed state , the two - mode entanglement parameter studied here can still give a necessary and sufficient condition of the separability of the two condensates .",
