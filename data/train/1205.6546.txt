    "statistical mechanics of fluids near an arbitrary permeable wall was constructed in @xcite . in the present paper , this theory is developed and applied to the adsorption problem with a finite step potential . in this case ,",
    "an important role is played by the specially designed apparatus of sectorial and orthant moments .",
    "the importance of this problem is due to two things .",
    "first , the step potential is an important model system .",
    "suffice it to say that this problem is an extension of the problem of a rigid impermeable wall and , in particular , it provides a generalization of the long and widely used contact theorem @xcite @xmath2 .    in this model system",
    ", surface cluster expansion plays an important role , primarily as an accurate method for validating any results in the range of not too high number densities @xmath3 .",
    "second , the step potential model is related to probabilistic problems . in particular ,",
    "the behavior of the nonlinear surface coefficient at high temperatures is related to the surface part of the standard deviation of the number density @xmath4 .",
    "however , as noted in @xcite , even the general problem of a permeable wall had not been considered in terms of statistical mechanics until 1980 .",
    "later , the emphasis has shifted to approximate and computational methods .    a number of results valid for the step potential is not considered in the present paper because they are formulated in general terms in @xcite .",
    "these are , for example , a proof of the identity of the `` tension '' and `` adsorption '' approaches , a consideration of the `` mechanical definition '' of @xmath1 , and other issues .",
    "the probability density of finding a given spatial configuration of a particular set of particles @xcite is given by @xmath5    here @xmath6 is the number of particles in the system , @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath9 is the temperature , @xmath10 is the particle interaction energy , and @xmath11 the volume of the system .",
    "the integration is performed over the coordinates of the particles of the ensemble .",
    "@xmath12 is the configuration integral @xmath13    passing to the distribution functions for an arbitrary set of particles , we obtain @xmath14    this quantity defines the probability density of finding a given configuration of @xmath15 arbitrary particles for a canonical ensemble .",
    "we average the equality @xmath16 over fluctuations in the number of particles , i.e. , apply the operation @xmath17 to both sides of the equation . here",

    "for an ideal gas , this quantity is equal to @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the number density .",
    "the ursell factors @xmath32 are also called cluster functions .",
    "these functions appear in the well - known pressure expansion in powers of the activity @xcite , @xcite @xmath33    they are also included in the corresponding expansion of the number density @xmath34 which is obvious from the formula @xmath35 taking into account the relationship ( [ eq:005 ] ) .",
    "the ursell factors have the locality property , which is important for our consideration : they decay rapidly as any group of particles , including unit groups , move away from the others .      for example , @xmath45      the configuration integral of a closed inhomogeneous system is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the energy of interaction of the @xmath48-th particle with the field .",
    "for the gce , we introduce the quantity @xmath49 which is obviously the grand partition function of the system in the presence of an external field .    for arbitrary activities ,",
    "the distribution functions have the form @xmath50 \\big \\ { \\exp\\big ( - \\beta u_{1 ... k}\\big )   \\\\ +   \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{z^n}{n ! } \\int \\limits_{v }   \\big [ \\prod_{i = k+1}^{k+n } \\theta_i \\big ]   \\exp\\big ( - \\beta u_{1 ...",

    "if the variation of the potential is constant in space , it is equal to the change in the chemical potential with the opposite sign , and from @xmath57 we obtain @xmath58 where the differentiation is performed at constant temperature .",
    "thus , this relation has the same form as in the case of a homogeneous medium @xcite .    using the properties of the fractional generating function @xmath59 @xmath60",
    ", we obtain an analog of @xmath61 @xmath62{\\cal u}^{(n+1)}_{1 ... n+1 } d\\bm{r}_{2} ... d\\bm{r}_{n+1 } \\label{eq:022},\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is the number density in the presence of an external field .",
    "we will also need the following expansion : @xmath64 { \\cal   u}^{(n+2)}_{1 ... n+2 } d\\bm{r}_{3} ...",

    "it is sufficient to note that this relation is provided by the same recurrence relations for the partial localization factors @xcite as in the homogeneous case .",
    "this section briefly summarizes the results obtained in @xcite for the case of a permeable wall with the near - surface potential of arbitrary form .",
    "it is shown that @xmath66\\int \\widetilde{\\varphi}(\\bm{r } ) d\\bm{r } + \\nu(z , z ' ) a , \\label{eq:024}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is the omega potential of the system with the field placed in it , @xmath68 is the bounding area of the field effect region , and @xmath69 dx \\label{eq:025}\\ ] ] is a nonlinear surface coefficient @xmath70 .",
    "here we have introduced the local pressure @xmath71 which , in this case , is equivalent to @xmath72    in addition , @xmath73 is the internal activity in the field region , @xmath74 is the potential of the external field in the depth of the field effect region , and the quantities @xmath75 } - \\exp { ( - \\beta u_0)}}{1 - \\exp { ( - \\beta u_0 ) } } \\label{eq:029}\\ ] ] and @xmath76 } } { 1 - \\exp { ( - \\beta u_0 ) } } ,   \\label{eq:030}\\ ] ] generalize the boltzmann factors @xmath77 and the mayer functions @xmath78 respectively .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath79 and that the functions @xmath80 and @xmath81 decay in and out of the field , respectively , and tend to 1 otherwise .",
    "in addition , they have the property @xmath82    the nonlinear surface coefficient is expanded in a series in the activity as @xmath83 where @xmath84\\prod_{i = 2}^n \\big [ z \\widetilde{\\theta}(x+x_i ) + z ' \\widetilde{\\varphi}(x+x_i ) \\big ] \\big \\ } d x \\label{eq:035}\\ ] ] is a function of the variables @xmath85 which is symmetric under permutations .",

    "the expression @xmath93 gives the general form of the specific surface @xmath0-potential .",
    "the last expression is divided into a term linear in pressure and the nonlinear term @xmath94 .",
    "we see that there is a certain degree of arbitrariness in the division into volume and surface terms .",
    "however , for the step potential , its role is not as important , due to the presence of a distinct boundary .",

    "note that @xmath111 , and the surface through @xmath110 can therefore be called the surface of zero adsorption .    using the expansion @xmath112 , for the henry absorption",
    "constant , we obviously have @xmath113",
    "we now consider the step potential .",
    "we examine an open statistical system in a field such that the field effect area is smaller than the size of the system itself and the field is away from its boundaries ; i.e. , this is still the case of `` a field in a system '' .",
    "the potential of the external fields is assumed to have a stepped form @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the coordinate at which the potential energy of the particles has a step discontinuity , and the interparticle potential is arbitrary , provided that it decays rapidly enough for the convergence of the zero- and first - order moments of the ursell factors .",
