    "wavefunction  based quantum chemistry methods as well as density functional theory ( dft ) are now well established electronic structure techniques within theoretical chemistry  @xcite .",
    "the former is traditionally used to investigate small finite systems , i.e. `` gas phase problems '' , whereas the latter had its first successes in solid state physics , i.e. , in the framework of `` periodic lattice problems '' .",
    "there is also ample evidence that wavefunction  based quantum chemistry methods are able to predict properties of molecular systems up to virtually any desired accuracy as a result of systematically improving the correlation treatment together with the wavefunction representation .",
    "however , the numerical complexity , as e.g. measured by the computer time needed for such studies , explodes easily _ in praxi _ either before reaching a sufficient level of accuracy or before treating systems that are sufficiently large .",
    "dft methods , on the other hand , are known to lead to astonishingly good predictions for a wide variety of systems at moderate cost   of course dramatic failures are also well documented in the literature .",
    "when describing molecular solids , associated liquids , or large biosystems , noncovalent interactions such as hydrogen bonds and van der waals interactions might play an important role . the ideal approach would be to use post hartree - fock methods converged to the basis set limit , which turns out to be computationally prohibitive , especially when used in conjunction with molecular dynamics .",
    "while simple dft methods are unable to correctly describe van der waals interactions @xcite , hydrogen bonds are known to be well within the capabilities of dft approaches once suitable gradient  corrected functionals are devised .",
    "a pioneering step in the early nineties was the investigation of hydrogen bonds in the water dimer  @xcite and in small water clusters  @xcite based on such functionals , which are of the generalised gradient approximation ( gga ) type .",
    "soon thereafter it was demonstrated that also the structure and dynamics of _ liquid bulk _ water can be described faithfully  @xcite .",
    "now there is ample evidence that various properties of water can be computed quite reliably using gga  type functionals , see e.g. refs .",

    "how about other hydrogen bonded systems ?    among hydrogen ",
    "bonded dimers the ammonia dimer is peculiar since it features a rather unusual hydrogen bond , see refs .",
    "@xcite for an early and a very recent overview . instead of an essentially linear hydrogen bond , similar to the one of the water dimer",

    "[ fig1]c or d. furthermore , close in energy is the so  called cyclic structure where an even more pronounced bending of the hydrogen bond produces two equivalent `` hydrogen bonding contacts '' according to fig .",
    "[ fig1]e . as an interlude",
    "we stress that such strongly bent hydrogen bonds play an important role in many biological systems , in particular if the bending allows for more than one interaction of a donor with acceptor molecules which leads to so  called bifurcated or multifurcated hydrogen bonds  @xcite . in carbohydrates over 25% of the hydrogen bonds turn out",
    "to be multifurcated  @xcite and in proteins  @xcite about 40 and 90% of the hydrogen bonds in @xmath8sheet and @xmath9helix structures , respectively , are of this type . in this context",
    "the ammonia dimer could serve as a prototype system in order to investigate nonlinear hydrogen bonding on the level of a minimal model , i.e. a free dimer in the gas phase .",
    "guided by analogy or chemical intuition , one might guess that the ammonia dimer possesses a `` classical '' quasi ",
    "linear hydrogen bond similar to other dimers such as those of water or hydrogen fluoride .",
    "early calculations , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite and references cited therein , actually assumed from the outset a perfectly linear bond similar to the one shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1]a or b or predicted a quasi  linear hydrogen bond as depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig1]c or d , while others  @xcite favoured strongly bent up to cyclic dimers similar to figs .",
    "[ fig1]c  e .",
    "this controversy got fueled by microwave measurements  @xcite providing evidence for a quasi  rigid cyclic structure such as the one in fig .",
    "the issue of a quasi  linear hydrogen bond vs. a cyclic structure remained controversial ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) up to early nineties where both experiment and theory started to converge .",
    "thanks to sophisticated experiments  @xcite and extensive computations  @xcite there is now consensus  @xcite that the ammonia dimer is a _",
    "fluxional _ molecular complex with an _ equilibrium structure",
    "_ that is characterized by a bent hydrogen bond such as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]c . combining far  infrared spectra with static and dynamic calculations  @xcite , the h  n@xmath6n hydrogen bond angle ( between the n  h bond of the proton donor and the n@xmath6n axis ) was determined to be 26@xmath7 in the equilibrium structure with a n@xmath6n distance of @xmath10   .",
    "note , however , that this `` experimental '' structure of the ammonia dimer was deduced within the rigid monomer approximation  @xcite , which might introduce a systematic bias . in fact , a recent study  @xcite of the water dimer has shown that monomer flexibility is indeed important in determining its vibration  rotation  tunneling spectrum and thus `` experimental '' structures derived from it .",
    "it is expected that such monomer flexibility would also be important for the ammonia dimer .",
    "furthermore , the global potential energy surface is found to be very flat  @xcite , e.g. the cyclic c@xmath11 structure was estimated to be about only 7  @xmath12 higher in energy , which is qualitatively consistent with the observation that the dimer is a very fluxional complex .",
    "most interestingly , there is now experimental support  @xcite advocating a more cyclic equilibrium structure for ( nh@xmath0)@xmath1 in superfluid helium droplets at 0.4  k.    more recent wavefunction  based quantum chemical calculations  @xcite on the structure and energetics of the ammonia dimer support in some aspects the earlier conclusions  @xcite .",

    "most recently , another ( valence  only ) mp2 study  @xcite , this time near the one  particle basis set limit , was reported . at the mp2 limit ,",
    "the hydrogen bond angle of 23@xmath7 was closer to the recommended value  @xcite , but the barrier of 24  @xmath12 seems too high and the dissociation energy @xmath13 ( into separated and optimized monomer fragments ) was estimated to be @xmath14  kj / mol .",
    "this clearly hints to the importance of higher  order correlation effects and core  valence corrections , in particular since they account for 0.4  kj / mol in the case of the water dimer  @xcite ( which already exceeds the error bar given in ref .",
    "dft calculations of the ammonia dimer are both rather scarce  @xcite and somewhat inconclusive as to what level of accuracy dft methods describe this intermolecular interaction . in the following we",
    "will clearly demonstrate that none of the 14 widely used gga , meta  gga , and hybrid functionals checked by us lead to a satisfactory description of both the structure and relative energies of the ammonia dimer ( despite large basis sets being used and basis set superposition error being corrected for ) .",
    "thus , even at the level of the ammonia dimer there is still room for improvement based on purely theoretical grounds  !",
    "thus far we considered the behavior of ammonia in the limit of forming a dimer , e.g. in the very dilute gas phase .",
    "the question arises , if or how its peculiar behavior concerning hydrogen  bonding in the dimer is present in its condensed phases ?",
    "indeed , based on the _ apparent _ stability and rigidity of the _ cyclic _ dimer in the gas phase  @xcite it was concluded in quite general terms some time ago that nh@xmath0 might well be best described as a powerful hydrogen  bond acceptor with little propensity to donate hydrogen bonds  @xcite ; note that now it is however recognized that the ammonia dimer is non  rigid and non ",
    "cyclic  @xcite .",
    "the x  ray structure of _ crystalline _ ammonia at low temperatures  @xcite features a staggered , directed hydrogen bonded network , with the monomers being arranged like the dimer in fig .",
    "[ fig1]d . furthermore , based on neutron powder diffraction experiments",
    ", it was proposed that solid ammonia has an `` unusual shared  hydrogen bond geometry ''  @xcite and , in particular , the high  pressure phase nd@xmath0_iv _ contains bifurcated hydrogen bonds with bending angles as large as about 30@xmath7 .",
    "a most recent theoretical study  @xcite , however , did not support the presence of bifurcated hydrogen bonds in phase _ iv _ of solid ammonia .",
    "in this latter study , it was concluded through calculations of electron density between intermolecular nitrogen and hydrogen atoms that the apparent bifurcated hydrogen bond geometry in solid ammonia _ iv _ is actually a single hydrogen bond perturbed by a neighboring interacting atom . the structure of _ liquid _",
    "ammonia has been studied by x ",
    "ray  @xcite and neutron  @xcite diffraction for a long time . only the total structure factor and the total radial distribution function",
    "could be extracted in these early experiments and the presence of hydrogen bonds in liquid ammonia was inferred from a comparison of the experimental structure factor with the known structure of the solid .",
    "more recently , a set of neutron diffraction experiments was performed  @xcite on liquid nh@xmath15 , nd@xmath15 , and an isomolar nh@xmath15/nd@xmath15 mixture .",
    "the powerful isotopic substitution technique , in conjunction with sophisticated data analysis , allowed extraction of all partial radial distribution functions at 213 and 273  k. contrary to earlier conceptions ( as presented in many standard textbooks on that subject ) the spatial arrangement of nitrogen atoms showed that no extended hydrogen bonded network exists in liquid ammonia . nevertheless , some degree of hydrogen bonding was inferred from the temperature dependence of the n - h and h - h radial distribution functions .",
    "however , the hydrogen bond interaction in liquid ammonia proved to be much weaker than that in water and no clear hydrogen bond peak was observed in either n - h or h - h correlations , unlike the case of water .    due to the importance of liquid ammonia and in particular its metallic solutions ,",
    "also many theoretical attempts have been made in past two decades to understand its liquid phase .",
    "most of these studies are based on classical monte carlo ( mc ) or molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations using empirical site ",
    "site @xcite or _ ab initio _",
    "pair potentials @xcite which all lead to essentially linear hydrogen bonds in the limit of treating the ammonia dimer . a recent pioneering study @xcite investigated the structure of liquid ammonia through car  parrinello _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics @xcite , i.e. without resorting to any pre  determined ( pairwise ) potentials but using the full many  body interactions as obtained by `` on the fly '' dft ( blyp ) instead .",
    "it was found that the results of the n - n , n - h and h - h radial distribution functions are in better agreement with experimental results than previous ones relying on model potentials .",
    "some important differences , however , still remained .",
    "for example , the results of this study were found to overestimate the hydrogen bonded structure as revealed by the n - h correlations and predict a narrower first peak of the n - n distribution when compared with the corresponding experimental results .",
    "also , a later such study @xcite of liquid ammonia containing an ammonium or an amide solute reported somewhat different results for the n - n and n - h correlations between the bulk ammonia molecules compared to those of ref .",
    "besides , the nature of the hydrogen bonds in the liquid phase is not fully understood yet , in particular in view of the experimental situation . as discussed before , unlike water , the ammonia dimer has a bent hydrogen bond in its equilibrium geometry .",
    "if this bent character of the dimer hydrogen bond has the same significant effects on the liquid as in solid phases  @xcite is still an unresolved issue , in particular since all pair potentials by construction yield a quasi  linear hydrogen bond as do existing density functionals .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section  ii",
    ", we describe the details of the computational methodologies that we employ for the calculations of the dimer and the liquid phase . in section  iii , we present results for important dimer structures and their energies based on highly accurate _",

    "section  iv focuses in detail on the development of the novel hcth/407 + functional , on its performance in various systems , and on the improvement achieved on the dimer level . in section",
    "v , we compare the results of _ ab initio _ md simulations of liquid ammonia using hcth/407 + to those obtained from the widely used blyp functional for reference purposes , and to experimental data wherever available .",
    "we summarise and conclude in section  vi .",
    "in this contribution , we develop a new generalised gradient approximation ( gga ) functional  which will be termed hcth/407 +  that only involves the density @xmath16(*r * ) and its gradient @xmath17(*r * ) .",
    "the latter has been shown to be a necessary ingredient for the description of hydrogen bonds within dft , see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite . to the contrary of with the so  called hybrid functionals that involve `` hartree  fock exchange '' ( such as e.g. b3lyp@xcite ) ,",

    "thus , we opted for reparametrising the hamprecht - cohen - tozer - handy ( hcth ) form , which has been described in detail elsewhere @xcite and was originally used by becke for a hybrid functional @xcite . in general , hcth is a post - local spin density approximation ( post- lsda ) functional , meaning that it factorises the lsda functional forms ( @xmath18 ) @xmath19 here , @xmath20 denotes the perturbation from the uniform electron gas if @xmath21 is unity .",

    "we used the blyp functional in addition to the new functional because the former has been shown to provide a good description of hydrogen bonded liquids such as water  @xcite , methanol  @xcite and also ammonia  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is worthwhile to compare the results of the two functionals for various structural and dynamical properties of liquid ammonia .",
    "the initial configuration of ammonia molecules was generated by carrying out a classical molecular dynamics simulation using the empirical multi - site interaction potential of ref .",
    "then , for simulation with the hcth/407 + ( blyp ) functional , we equilibrated the system for 8.75 ( 10.1)ps at 273k in nvt ensemble using nose - hoover chain method and , thereafter , we continued the run in nve ensemble for another 9.30 ( 9.34)ps for calculation of the various structural and dynamical quantities ; the average temperatures of these microcanonical runs were about 275 ( 252 )  k. we note that the size of the simulation box used in the present simulations corresponds to the experimental density of liquid ammonia at 273  k which is @xmath42 molecules/  @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "in order to briefly validate the w2 method for some representative hydrogen bonded systems , ( hf)@xmath1 and ( h@xmath1o)@xmath1 , we compared the w2 results to mp2 basis set limit corrections applied to coupled cluster calculations@xcite , whereas the reference data was additionally empirically refined by scaling the calculations to certain quantum energy levels .",
    "moreover , to get an estimate of the accuracy of the basis set extrapolation , we compared with the more cost - effective alternative of w2 , which is w1 @xcite .",
    "when calculated at the same geometry as w2 , it usually yields a fair estimate as to how well the basis set limit is obtained in the extrapolation . in table",

    "all the w1 and w2 results are within the stated error margins of the reference data . while the dissociation energy of the hydrogen fluoride dimer is exactly the same , that of water dimer is slightly lower than predicted in reference @xcite . in the latter case , relativistic corrections",
    "were not included in their best estimate .",
    "this will reduce the energy somewhat ; however we would expect a geometry relaxation to lower the energy .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite used a ccsd(t)/aug - cc - pvtz geometry and estimated the geometry relaxation , whereas the w2 calculation is carried out at an ccsd(t)/apvqz geometry .",
    "nevertheless , the results show only 0.03 kj / mol difference between the w1 and w2 method for the hf dimer and 0.09 kj / mol for the water dimer , indicating the high accuracy of these methods for such interactions .",
    "finally , the ( h@xmath1o)(nh@xmath0 ) dissociation energy is predicted to be 26.8 kj / mol by w2 , compared to 27.4 kj / mol determined by experiment @xcite ; unfortunately no high - level _ ab initio _ data were found in the literature for this mixed dimer .",

    "as to the accuracy of the electron correlation methods underlying the w2 method , we can make the following observations :    * quasiperturbative connected triple excitations , i.e. , the ccsd(t )  ccsd difference , only contribute 0.5 @xmath12 to the c@xmath11 barrier with cp correction and 0.7 @xmath12 without ; * this has also been verified by ccsd(tq ) [ bd(tq ) ] calculations , where the contribution of the perturbative connected quadruples lowers the barrier by 0.2 @xmath12 [ 0.3 @xmath12 ] with the a@xmath34pvdz basis set ; * higher - order connected triples ( i.e. , ccsdt - ccsd(t ) ) additionally lower the barrier by 0.2 cm @xmath47 when using a@xmath34pvdz .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that not only has basis set convergence been achieved , but also that higher - order excitations beyond ccsd(t ) will contribute less than 1 @xmath12 ; * further optimisation of the c@xmath45 geometry at the mp2/apv5z level lowers the binding energy by only 0 .. 3 @xmath12 ( 0.004 kj / mol ) relative to mp2/a@xmath34pv5z//mp2/a@xmath34pvqz ; * we do not expect relaxation of the geometry at the core - valence level to make a significant contribution , since even for the monomer the core - valence correction to the geometry is very small @xcite .    still , the difference between the bsse - corrected and uncorrected results is rather large . based on these results , we suggest that the c@xmath45 to c@xmath11 energy difference is 3.5 @xmath48 3 @xmath12 , and we would expect the barriers between the linear and minimum geometries to be equally well described by w2 . for the slightly improved ccsd(t ) geometry , by correcting ccsd(t)/a@xmath34pvqz - mp2/a@xmath34pvqz + mp2/a@xmath34pv5z , we predict the hnn angle to be 20.7 degrees . as for the c@xmath11 barrier , the interaction energy is raised by 0.002 kj / mol when going from ccsd(t ) to ccsdt , showing that the quasiperturbative triples treatment ( and the quadruples estimation as well ) is quite accurate . using an a@xmath34pvdz basis set",
    ", the quasi - perturbative quadruples treatment lowers the binding energy by 0.092 kj / mol for the coupled cluster and 0.087 kj / mol when using the brueckner - doubles method . with the geometry relaxation contributing less than 0.005 kj / mol at mp2 level and the estimate of the higher order excitations",
    ", we predict the dissociation energy to be 13.1 @xmath48 0.2 kj / mol , since the main error is likely to come from the quadruple excitations .",
    "the results obtained using a selection of currently published functionals are shown in table [ tab3 ] .",
    "for comparison , the ccsd(t ) , ccsd , mp2 and hf values are given .",
    "it should be noted , however , that bsse for the coupled - cluster values is more than twice as high as for dft ( 0.9 compared to 0.4 kj / mol ) , and therefore we would expect the dft calculations to be closer to their respective basis set limits than the _ ab initio _ methods .",
    "nevertheless , their bsse is still larger than that at the hf level .",
    "as expected , the ccsd(t ) and w2 numbers are reasonably close to each other .",
    "most density functional methods reproduce the dissociation energy as listed in the first column , reasonably well .",
    "in general , the gga and meta - gga functionals tested give a good description of this interaction underestimate and pw91 overestimating the dissociation energy .",
    "the tested hybrid functionals are even more accurate , yet all of them underestimating the dissociation energy .",
    "however , if we consider the energy difference between the staggered and eclipsed conformation of the nh@xmath0-dimer ( see the data in the second column of table [ tab3 ] ) , it becomes obvious that available functionals are incapable of reproducing the effect of a bent hydrogen bond .",
    "it is found that density functionals typically underestimate the difference between the local and global minima by at least a factor of two .",
    "we note here that functionals other than those listed in our tables ( such as e.g. pw91 , b97 - 2 , pbe0 ) yield similar results which are therefore not displayed . on the other hand ,",

    "the same trends are seen in table [ tab4 ] , where the hnn angles of the two minimum structures are shown . here",
    ", available density functionals underestimate the bending of the hydrogen bond by almost a factor of two for the global minimum and by about 30% for the local ( staggered ) minimum , although the hydrogen bond distance itself is reasonably well reproduced .",

    "hcth/407 is the only functional which is somewhat capable of reproducing the effect , outperforming hartree - fock .    in summary ,",
    "although standard density functionals do yield a correct dissociation energy and a slightly nonlinear hydrogen bond , they completely overestimate the barrier towards the symmetrical c@xmath11 structure , thereby preferring a much more linear hydrogen - bonding configuration than our accurate reference methods . although the energy differences might be viewed as intrinsically too small to be accurately rendered by dft",
    ", the fact that even hf gives better results is somewhat disturbing .",
    "nevertheless , the observation that hartree - fock and hcth/407 are somewhat capable of properly predicting the structure and energetics of the ammonia dimer system suggests that the problem at hand is not beyond the grasp of density functional methods as such .",
    "considering that standard density functionals were shown to be unable to describe the energy difference between linear and bent hydrogen bonds and do not capture the large bending angle of the hydrogen bond , the most obvious remedy would be to change the functional form itself .",
    "however , if all tested functionals give such a bad description , this is unlikely to solve the problem .",
    "the culprit in this case , therefore , has to be the set of molecules which the hcth functionals are fit to , insofar as only linearly hydrogen - bonded systems have been included . nevertheless , including the minimum structure and energetics of the ammonia dimer determined in the previous section into the set",
    "probably only partly solves this problem .",
    "the main problem , as established before , is the energy difference between the linear and bent hydrogen bonds .",
    "in addition , the tz2p basis set commonly used in the fit set might not be appropriate . even when employing the a@xmath34pvtz basis set mentioned above , the basis set superposition error for the dimerisation energy is 29 @xmath12 , contributing 8 @xmath12 to the energy difference between the minimum and symmetric structure when using the b97 - 1 functional .",
    "in comparison , using the tz2p basis set , the bsse is 92 @xmath12 , contributing 33 @xmath12 to the energy difference . clearly , the tz2p basis set is inappropriate for this problem .",
    "the above numbers indicate that a counterpoise procedure has to be employed within the fit in order to get a good estimate .",
    "note that even when using an extrapolation to the full basis set limit ( in the case of w2 ) , the difference between the counterpoise corrected and uncorrected values is already 3 @xmath12 .",
    "all of the above issues were considered in the fit .. thus , we fit to all points shown in figure [ fig1 ] employing an a@xmath34pvtz basis set with counterpoise correction in the fit .",
    "this is the first time we are fitting to non - equilibrium structures , and we only fit to their energy differences and exchange - correlation potentials of these . due to the energy difference of only a couple of wavenumbers , an additional weight has to be employed for any change in the fit to be noticeable .",
    "thus , equation ( 3 ) now reads @xmath49 with @xmath50 since we do not want to fit to a given value of basis set superposition error , it is included in @xmath51 .",
    "the weights @xmath52 now also include the additional weights for the potential energy surface with the other weights defined as before @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath53 is composed of @xmath54 when determining the weights for the new members of the fit set , we need to consider both their a@xmath34pvtz optimised energies as well as their a@xmath34pvtz single - point energies at the ccsd(t)/a@xmath34pvqz optimised geometries .",
    "the latter is necessary since we can only fit to single points . as a result of the small energy differences ,",
    "the frozen - geometry single - point energies and optimised energies differ by a significant amount .",
    "the development procedure is similar to the one employed for the hcth/407 functional , and the set includes numerous atomisation energies , proton affinities , ionisation potentials , electron affinities , and dissociation energies of hydrogen - bonded dimers and transition metal complexes @xcite .",
    "first , we fit to a subset of the 407 molecules in order to get close to the global minimum , then we fit to the full set .",
    "the latter subset ( small set ) is the g2 - 1 set plus two hydrogen - bonded systems ( h@xmath1o)@xmath1 and ( hf)@xmath1 , and the additional structures on the potential energy surface , making 153 systems in all ( the 147 of the hcth/147 functional plus the five pes points , in addition to the nh@xmath0 dissociation energy at the tz2p basis ) . for each point on the pes ,",
    "the counterpoise correction was employed .",
    "the results using the newly determined functionals as a function of the weights have been determined in both the first fit ( to 153 systems ) and the second fit ( to 413 systems ) .",
    "thus , we obtained new functionals with weights ranging from 0/0 ( which corresponds to the hcth/407 functional ) to 200/200 .",
    "the first weight is the one used in the subset , while the second corresponds to the large fit .",
    "the importance of the weights in the first fit can be seen from the differences by using weight pairs of 30/80 and 80/80 - they differ by about a factor of two in the energy difference between the staggered and eclipsed geometry .",
    "hence , the minimum obtained by the second fit will of necessity be close to the global minimum obtained by the first one .",
    "when increasing these weights , we approach the reference values as expected , with the 200/200 functional rendering the closest values to the reference method . while not explicitly included in the fit , the bsse also increased from 0.444 kj / mol to 0.866 kj / mol .",
    "this resembles the tendency of the functional to have a larger intermolecular distance than the reference methods when increasing the weights , hence entering a regime where the bsse increases more rapidly than for the optimised structures . in comparison ,",
    "the largest bsse observed by the functionals tested in table [ tab3 ] is 0.48 kj / mol .",
    "however , for all the calculations in the fit we have performed only dft single - point energy calculations at the ccsd(t ) optimised geometries .",
    "another , more appropriate , point of comparison consists of the optimised structures of all the newly obtained functionals , as done in table [ tab3 ] for the contemporary functionals .",
    "since the energy differences in general are very small , these results differ significantly from the ones obtained by the single - point energies calculated at the coupled - cluster geometries . in addition",
    ", the c@xmath11 structure becomes the global minimum for the functionals with a weight of 80 or larger in the first fit .",
    "based on these results , the 30/80 functional appears to be the most reliable for this interaction , and hence will be denoted as the new hcth/407 + functional .",
    "this new functional ( compare to table [ tab3 ] ) now renders a dissociation energy of 13.18  kj / mol for the ammonia dimer , in much closer agreement to the reference values than any other method employed .",
    "the difference between the c@xmath45 minimum and the c@xmath11 structure is 4.0 @xmath12 for hcth/407 + , compared to our best estimate of 3.5 @xmath12 in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "the staggered c@xmath45 structure lies 18 @xmath12 above its eclipsed counterpart , which is about five wavenumbers higher than our best estimate but still within its error bars .",
    "the difference to the linear eclipsed and linear staggered structures are slightly underestimated at 51.5 and 53.5 @xmath12 respectively , but this is still a vast improvement over the other functionals . in figure [ fig2 ] , we compare the energies of the new hcth/407 + functional to w2 and one of the most commonly used gga functionals ( blyp ) .",
    "the bsse for the relaxed c@xmath45 structures does not increase as rapidly as for their ccsd(t ) optimised counterparts .",
    "it increases from 0.43 ( hcth/407 ) to 0.45 ( hcth/407 + ) to 0.61 kj / mol ( weight of 200 ) , and does not yield as unreasonably large values as the single - point calculations at the ccsd(t ) geometries .",
    "the hydrogen bond lengths of the c@xmath45 and c@xmath11 structures increase with larger weights , emphasising the importance of this analysis .",
    "generally , all hcth functionals are found to slightly overestimate this hydrogen bond length .",
    "the hnn angle of the hcth/407 + functional is 17 @xmath44 for the minimum geometry .",
    "this is within the accuracy that can be expected from contemporary density functionals ( @xmath48 2@xmath44 ) , showing a significant improvement over all other density functionals in table [ tab4 ] .",
    "the results for all functionals obtained with different weights ( from which we determined the hcth/407 + functional ) are given in the supplementary material .",
    "@xcite the parameters which define the hcth/407 + functional , compared to hcth/407 , are given in table [ tab5 ] .",
    "as might be expected , they differ only slightly from those for the standard hcth/407 functional ; only the correlation and higher - order coefficients have significantly been affected by the change .. nevertheless , the new functional should now be able to describe non - directed hydrogen bonds better than hcth/407 .",
    "on the level of the ammonia dimer , the improvement with respect to other density functionals becomes clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ; see table  [ tab3 ] for the corresponding numbers .",
    "it is seen that hcth/407 + describes the relative stability of all isomers much better with respect to the w2 reference data than blyp , which was selected as a prominent representative of the gga family .",
    "most importantly , the dramatic failure of blyp to capture the stability of the cyclic c@xmath11 isomer relative to all other isomers is cured .",
    "according to hcth/407 + , the two @xmath2 structures as well as the @xmath4 structure are essentially degenerate , which is in accord with the reference data .. apart from the energetics , also the structure of the ground state of the ammonia dimer , i.e. the eclipsed @xmath2 structure , is dramatically improved , see table  [ tab4 ] for details .",
    "in particular the hydrogen bond angle hnn is now much larger and thus closer to the reference value than _ any _ other density functional method ; note that also the functionals pw91 , b97 - 2 , and pbe0 were considered .",
    "the same is true for the hnn angle in the staggered variant of the @xmath2 symmetric structure .",
    "however , it is also clear from this table that the n@xmath6h distance is clearly overestimated : hcth/407 + yields a distance of about 2.5     instead of around 2.3     as required .",
    "this seems to be typical for the hcth family as both hcth/120 and hcth/407 yield similarly large values exceeding 2.4     ( and hcth/93 leads to 2.614   ) .",
    "in addition , the same trend of producing too long hydrogen bonds is found for the @xmath4 structure .",
    "this deficiency is corrected by both @xmath40-hcth and @xmath40-hcth hybrid functionals . here",
    "it should be noted that both blyp and pbe describe the hydrogen bond length quite well , however at the expense of making it much too linear and grossly disfavoring the cyclic structure energetically .",
    "furthermore , this significant improvement in describing non - directed hydrogen bonds , however , comes at the expense of a slightly increased error for the other molecules in the fit set .",
    "table [ tab6 ] shows the errors of the hcth/407 and hcth/407 + functionals to the fit set , summarising these as rms energy and geometry errors , together with the errors for the energies , geometry shifts and frequency shifts of nine hydrogen - bonded systems .",
    "the values for b3lyp , blyp and bp86 are included for comparison .",
    "the hydrogen - bonded systems are the ( hf)@xmath1 , ( hcl)@xmath1 , @xmath55 , ( co)(hf ) , ( oc)(hf ) , ( fh)(nh@xmath0 ) , ( clh)(nh@xmath0 ) , @xmath56 and @xmath57 complexes , but not the nh@xmath0 dimer itself .",
    "the performance of other functionals over all the sets has been discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "overall , errors for the hcth/407 + functional are quite similar to hcth/407 , which in turn means that they are still excellent compared to first - generation hybrid functionals like b3lyp and especially gga functionals like blyp or bp86 . although we expect the geometries to be still slightly worse than b3lyp ( although the gradient error is comparable ) , the energetic properties are better described , as are the hydrogen bonds .",
    "whereas the errors of the hcth/407 + functional for the fit set have barely changed compared to hcth/407 , the accuracy of the dissociation energies of the nine directed hydrogen bonds has actually decreased by about 20% .",
    "nonetheless , the accuracy of the frequency shifts of the h - x bond stretches has increased , indicating that we seem to have improved the description of the potential energy surface of these complexes .",
    "we have calculated the nitrogen - nitrogen , hydrogen - hydrogen and nitrogen - hydrogen radial distribution functions ( rdf ) from the atomic trajectories generated by _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics simulations ; note again that we used the mass of the deuteron instead of that of the proton but we still use the symbol h for convenience .",
    "the results for both hcth/407 + and blyp functionals are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . in this figure , we have also included the experimental results @xcite of the rdfs of liquid ammonia at 273  k ; note that the underlying experimental technique is based on the assumption that the structure of all isotopically substituted systems is identical . for the nitrogen - nitrogen rdf",
    ", it is seen that at the short distances the blyp @xmath58 is in better agreement with experimental results .",
    "the hcth/407 + peak is located at a distance of about 0.15     larger than the experimental peak position whereas the blyp peak appears at a somewhat shorter distance .",
    "we note in this context that the hcth/407 + functional gives an overestimated equilibrium n - n distance for the isolated dimer compared to the reference ccsd(t ) result as can be inferred from table  [ tab4 ] .",
    "the larger n - n distance seems to be translated to the liquid phase configurations and we observe a somewhat larger most probable n - n distance for the hcth/407 + functional than what is found in the experiments .",
    "still , the overall shape of the first peak is represented reasonably well by both the functionals .",
    "when the rdfs are integrated up to their first minimum to obtain the coordination number in the first solvation shell , we obtained the values of 13.2 and 12.1 for hcth/407 + and blyp functionals compared to an experimental value of 12.75 .",
    "clearly , the agreement with experimental results is found to be rather good .",
    "considering the results of the h - h and n - h rdfs , the positions of the calculated intramolecular h - h and n - h peaks for both the functionals agree rather well with experimental results as expected .",
    "for example , the liquid phase n - h bond length and intramolecular h - h distance for the hcth/407 + ( blyp ) functionals are 1.03 ( 1.03 )     and 1.63 ( 1.65 )     which can be compared with the experimental values of 1.04     and 1.60   , respectively . also , these intramolecular distances in the liquid phase are very close to their gas phase values .",
    "this was also noted earlier for the blyp functional @xcite .",
    "because of the quantum disperson effects which are present in real liquid but not in the current simulated systems , the experimental intramolecular peaks are found to be broader than the theoretical peaks .",
    "the somewhat higher value of the experimental h - h correlation at the first minimum at around 2     can also be attributed to such quantum dispersion effects .",
    "the intermolecular h - h peaks are found to be well represented by both functionals .",
    "the intermolecular part of the n - h rdf shows the presence of both h - bonded and non h - bonded h atoms in the first solvation shell .",
    "the shoulder up to about 2.7     can be attributed to hydrogen bonded h atoms , while the more pronounced peak at the larger distance at around 3.75     corresponds to the hydrogen atoms in the solvation shell which are not hydrogen bonded .",
    "again , both functionals are found to describe well the non - hydrogen bonded first solvation shell peak when compared with the corresponding experimental result .",
    "for the hydrogen bonded part , however , the hcth/407 + result is found to exhibit a less pronounced shoulder than what is found in the experiments and for the blyp functional .",
    "this is probably a result of the slight overestimation of the hydrogen bond length by hcth/407 + already on the level of the dimer , see table  [ tab4 ] . considering both hydrogen bonded and non - hydrogen bonded h atoms , a sphere of radius 5.3 ( 5 .. 2 )     around a central n atom is found to contain 34.1 ( 34 ) intermolecular h atoms for the hcth/407 + ( blyp ) functional .",
    "the radius of the sphere is set to 5.3 ( 5.2 )     because the first minimum of the intermolecular n - h rdf is located at this distance .",
    "the corresponding radius for the experimental n - h rdf is 5.0   , yielding the experimental value of 34.8 for the above coordination number .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the distribution of hydrogen bonds in liquid ammonia is given in the following subsection , and the dynamical aspects of hydrogen bonds are considered in sect .",
    "[ sec : hbdyn ] .",
    "the analysis of the hydrogen bond ( hb ) distribution among ammonia molecules is based on a calculation of the fractions @xmath59 of ammonia molecules that engage in @xmath60 hydrogen bonds and the average number of hydrogen bonds that an ammonia molecule donates and accepts  @xcite . following previous work on liquid ammonia , water and other hydrogen bonding liquids @xcite ,",
    "we have adopted a geometric definition of the hydrogen bonds where two ammonia molecules are assumed to be hydrogen bonded if they satisfy the following configurational criteria with respect to n - n and n - h distances @xmath61 and the values of these distance cut - offs are usually determined from the positions of the first minimum of the corresponding ( intermolecular ) rdfs . we have used a similar procedure where the n - n rdf gives a value of r@xmath62 = 5.25 ( 5.1 )     for the n - n cut - off for hcth/407 + ( blyp ) functionals .",
    "however , the procedure can not be applied unambiguously to determine the n - h cut - off because no clear minimum that separates the hydrogen bonded and nonbonded h atoms is found in the n - h rdf . in the latter case ,",
    "the shoulder which is assigned to hydrogen bonded h atoms merges into the broad and more intense peak corresponding to the h atoms of the first solvation shell which are not hydrogen bonded . since this shoulder  which corresponds to the hydrogen bonded h atoms  extends up to about 2.7     in the experimental and blyp rdfs",
    "we have taken this distance of 2.7     as the cutoff n - h distance . for hcth/407 + also",
    ", we have used the same cut - off of the n - h distance although the hydrogen bonded shoulder is less pronounced for this functional .",
    "still , variation of @xmath63 within reasonable bounds does not change qualitatively the result of this analysis .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we have shown the distribution of donor and acceptor hydrogen bonds for both hcth/407 + and blyp functionals . in this figure , panels ( a ) and ( b ) show the fraction of ammonia molecules that accept or donate @xmath60 hydrogen bonds and panel ( c ) shows the fraction of hydrogen atoms that donate @xmath60 hydrogen bonds .",
    "the majority of the ammonia molecules is found to accept one hydrogen bond and to donate one .",
    "also , the fraction of hydrogen atoms donating two or more hydrogen bonds is found to be negligibly small , which means that the bifurcated or multifurcated hydrogen bonds are practically absent in liquid ammonia .",
    "the average number of donor hydrogen bonds per ammonia molecule , which is also equal to the average number of acceptor hydrogen bonds per molecule , is found to be 0.93 ( 1.34 ) for the hcth/407 + ( blyp ) functional .",
    "given that there are as many as about 13 ammonia molecules in the first solvation shell , we conclude that non  hydrogen  bonded interactions , i.e. packing or steric effects , are crucial in determining the solvation behavior of ammonia in the liquid state .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the case of liquid water where the solvation structure of a water molecule is determined primarily by hydrogen bonding interactions @xcite .",
    "the ammonia dimer has a strongly bent hydrogen bond in its equilibrium geometry and it would be interesting to investigate whether the hydrogen bonds remain bent in the liquid phase .",
    "we have carried out such an analysis by calculating the distribution function of the cosine of the hydrogen bond angle @xmath64 , which is defined as the n@xmath6 n  h angle of a hydrogen bonded pair and the results are shown in fig ..  [ fig5]a for both the functionals .",
    "it is seen that , for both the functionals , the probability distribution @xmath65 is peaked at @xmath66 indicating that the _ preferred hydrogen bond geometry is linear in the liquid phase _ , see ref .",
    "the peak is somewhat more sharp and narrower for the blyp functional , which means a stronger preference for the linear hydrogen bonds for this functional as compared to that for the hcth/407 + functional .",
    "this preferential presence of linear hydrogen bonds in the liquid phase is indeed an interesting result given that the dimer has a bent hydrogen bond in the gas phase .",
    "we have also investigated the distribution of n@xmath6 n  h angle for h atoms that belong to nearest neighbours but are not hydrogen bonded , i.e. the n@xmath6h distance is greater than 2.7   .",

    "the results of @xmath94 are shown in fig ..  [ fig7]c .",
    "we used a least - squares fit of eq.(14 ) to the simulation results of the reactive flux , @xmath93 and @xmath94 to produce the forward and backward rate constants .",
    "we performed the fitting in the short time region @xmath101  ps to obtain the rate constants and the corresponding average hydrogen bond lifetime for the librational relaxation and we also carried out the fitting on the longer time region 0.25  ps @xmath67 t @xmath67 3  ps to calculate these quantities for slower rotational and translational diffusional relaxation .",
    "the inverses of the corresponding forward rate constants , which correspond to the average hydrogen bond lifetimes and which we denote as @xmath102 and @xmath103 , are included in table vii .",
    "we note that the value of @xmath102 is very close to average hydrogen bond lifetime @xmath84 obtained from the continuous hydrogen bond correlation function @xmath88 which is not unexpected because both @xmath88 and the short - time part of the ` reactive flux ' captures the hydrogen bond ` breaking ' dynamics due to fast librational motion .",
    "the hydrogen bond lifetime as given by @xmath104 is significantly longer because it excludes the fast librational relaxation .",
    "we have investigated the properties of ammonia from the gas phase dimer to the liquid state by means of wavefunction based quantum chemistry techniques , density functional theory , and _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics .",
    "the ammonia dimer is a particularly interesting hydrogen ",
    "bonded system , as it is known to feature a strongly bent hydrogen bond . in order to investigate possible consequences of this nonlinear hydrogen bond , important points on the potential energy surface",
    "were first investigated by means of _ ab initio _ methods up to w2extrapolated ccsd(t ) theory , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for the corresponding structures .",
    "the structure and energetics of important isomers are obtained up to unprecedented accuracy without resorting to experiment ; see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and table  [ tab4 ] for structures , and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and table  [ tab3 ] for energies .",
    "it is confirmed that the structure of the global minimum ( having eclipsed @xmath2 symmetry ) possesses a substantially nonlinear hydrogen bond with an h ",
    "n@xmath6n angle that is predicted to be 20.7@xmath7 ; note that the corresponding angle is predicted to be 5.5@xmath7 in the water dimer .",
    "the energy difference between the global minimum and the c@xmath11 transition state ( which is the famous `` cyclic structure '' ) is about 3.5  @xmath12 , and the energy penalty to make the hydrogen bond artificially linear amounts to only 70  @xmath12 , i.e. 0.2  kcal / mol or 0.009  ev .",
    "this implies that the potential energy surface is _ very _ flat .",
    "however , when investigating the ammonia dimer using a wide variety of available density functionals ( including important representatives of the gga , meta  gga and hybrid functional families ) it was found that _ none _ of the functionals checked by us describes the bent hydrogen bond in ( nh@xmath0)@xmath1 satisfactorily . typically , the hydrogen bond angle is too small by a factor of two and the energy of the cyclic @xmath4 structure w.r.t .",
    "the eclipsed @xmath2 global minimum is overestimated by a factor of 10 to 30 . since ammonia is an important hydrogen bonded liquid , a density functional",
    "was developed for studying this subtle system , with particular focus on its applicability for condensed phase simulations in the framework of car  parrinello molecular dynamics . to this end , a novel gga ",
    "type density functional , hcth/407 + , was developed , with special emphasis on the nonlinear hydrogen bond and potential energy surface of ( nh@xmath0)@xmath1 . this functional yields the bent hydrogen ",
    "bonded equilibrium structure of the ammonia dimer , as well as the correct energetics of the low  lying isomers including the energy barrier to a linear hydrogen  bond .",
    "the performance of the new functional in describing the structural and dynamical properties of liquid ammonia was investigated by carrying out car  parrinello molecular dynamics simulations of the liquid phase .",
    "in addition , simulations were carried out using a gga  type functional that is widely used for describing associated liquids , blyp , and the results of the two functionals are compared with experiments wherever available .",
    "in particular , we focused on the atom - atom radial distribution functions , on structure and dynamics of hydrogen bonds , and on diffusion as well as orientational relaxation processes .",
    "overall , both functionals are found to describe the structural and dynamical properties of the liquid phase reasonably well .",
    "importantly , it is shown that the propensity to form a strongly bent hydrogen bond  which is characteristic for the equilibrium structure of the gas  phase ammonia dimer   is overwhelmed by steric packing effects that clearly dominate the solvation shell structure in the liquid state .",
    "similarly , the propensity of ammonia molecules to form bifurcated and multifurcated hydrogen bonds in the liquid phase is found to be negligibly small .",
    "thus , even functionals that lead to unreasonably linear hydrogen bonds in the limiting case of the in vacuo ammonia dimer , such as blyp , yield a good description of _ liquid _ ammonia   albeit for the wrong reason !    we are grateful to professor martina havenith for pointing out the pecularities of the ammonia dimer and for stimulating discussions .",

    "<S> it is demonstrated that none of the currently available ( gga , meta  gga , and hybrid ) density functionals satisfactorily describe the structure and relative energies of this nonlinear hydrogen bond . </S>",
    "<S> we present a novel density functional , hcth/407 + , which is designed to describe this sort of hydrogen bond quantitatively on the level of the dimer , contrary to e.g. the widely used blyp functional . </S>",
    "<S> this improved generalised gradient approximation ( gga ) functional is employed in car  parrinello _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics simulations of liquid ammonia to judge its performance in describing the associated liquid . </S>",
    "<S> both the hcth/407 + and blyp functionals describe the properties of the liquid well as judged by analysis of radial distribution functions , hydrogen bonding structure and dynamics , translational diffusion , and orientational relaxation processes . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that the solvation shell of the ammonia molecule in the liquid phase is dominated by steric packing effects and not so much by directional hydrogen bonding interactions . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the propensity of ammonia molecules to form bifurcated and multifurcated hydrogen bonds in the liquid phase is found to be negligibly small .     </S>",
