    "this is facilitated by a geometric clock postulate that provides the proper time along the worldline @xmath0 of an observer , or massive particle , moving through the spacetime manifold  @xmath1 .",
    "the most general geometric clock postulate for which proper time  @xmath2 $ ] depends locally on the position and four - velocity is a reparametrization - invariant functional of the form @xmath3=\\int d\\tau \\ , f(x(\\tau),\\dot x(\\tau))\\,.\\ ] ] for time measurements in general relativity the function  @xmath4 is determined by a lorentzian metric @xmath5 as @xmath6 .",
    "more general @xmath4 are the basic ingredient of finsler geometry  @xcite , which generalizes riemannian geometry so that all geometric objects and fields depend not only on the points of the manifold but also on its tangent directions .    in physics ,",
    "the integral  @xmath2 $ ] in ( [ eqn : flength ] ) plays a fundamental role . on the one hand , it provides a definition of proper time that is independent of the actual clock used ; on the other hand , the worldlines of observers and massive particles are determined as the curves that extremize the integral .    because of the generality of the finsler clock postulate it is no surprise that finsler geometry has emerged in a number of different physical contexts in recent years . from the perspective of fundamental physical theory",
    "the importance of finsler geometry was realized : in various approaches to quantum gravity to describe the effective classical geometry of planck scale modified dispersion relations and the breaking of local lorentz invariance , e.g. in  @xcite ; for generalized backgrounds defined by hyperbolic polynomials  @xcite ; and for covariant formulations of electrodynamics in very general linear and non - linear optical media  @xcite . on a more phenomenological level ,",
    "simple finsler backgrounds allow fits of astronomical and cosmological data that are not satisfactorily explained by general relativity : the pioneer anomaly , dark matter and dark energy  @xcite .",
    "this appears very promising ; a closer inspection , however , reveals that it is not at all straightforward to describe the fundamental geometric structure of spacetime by finsler geometry . in order to do so",
    "a number of basic conceptual issues need to be resolved first :    * the mathematical foundations , including the construction of connections , covariant derivatives and curvature , are tailored for the case of definite finsler metrics that are a direct generalization of definite riemannian geometry .",
    "these constructions are not directly applicable to generalize the lorentzian signature case .",
    "previous work to remedy this situation turns out not to be sufficient : finsler metrics with globally lorentzian signature , e.g. in  @xcite , do not include the metric limit ; in certain finsler spaces  @xcite it is not possible to discuss the motion of light ; other definitions  @xcite exclude too many interesting applications like that to electrodynamics in optical media . *",
    "the causal structure of a finsler spacetime needs to be clarified , as has been observed in  @xcite .",
    "a good definition must provide a precise notion of timelike vectors , and hence a clear definition of observers .",
    "at the same time it must allow the discussion of null motion which is essential to describe the effective propagation of light .",
    "* action principles for the formulation of field theories on finsler spacetime should be available .",
    "previous work on this topic includes the osculating formalism  @xcite which , however , does not allow the full reconstruction of the fields from solutions of the equations of motion .",
    "other approaches use actions with divergency problems  @xcite that technically are not suited to derive equations of motion , or are not immediately related to standard finsler geometry formulations over the manifold and its tangent bundle  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we will develop solutions for these conceptual problems . through our results it becomes possible to use finsler spacetimes , instead of lorentzian manifolds , as consistent generalized geometric backgrounds for physics .",
    "in section  [ sec : spacetime ] we will provide a concise new definition of lorentzian finsler spacetimes , along with a discussion of the immediate physical implications . the standard mathematical technology used in finsler geometry",
    "is reviewed in section  [ sec : geometry ] , before we will prove the important result that finsler spacetimes in our sense allow a clean extension of the definition of connections , covariant derivatives and curvature to their null structure . in section  [ sec : causal ] we will demonstrate the existence of open convex cones of timelike vectors with null boundaries as in lorentzian metric geometry .",
    "we will then employ these results to describe the motion of observers and the effective motion of light by means of timelike and null finsler geodesics .",
    "the impact of our definition and the proven theorems on the causal structure will be illustrated by means of two examples in section  [ sec : examples ] .",
    "the first example discusses standard lorentzian metric spacetimes as a special case of finsler spacetimes .",
    "the second example goes beyond metric geometry ; it has a more complicated null structure with two cones of light propagation and is relevant for the description of birefringent optical media . in section  [ sec : actions ] we will present a new method for the formulation of well - defined action integrals on finsler spacetime .",
    "this method is based on the restriction of the tangent bundle to a subbundle on which homogeneous lagrangians can be integrated . with this formalism",
    "we will explicitly construct a generalized theory of electrodynamics on finsler spacetimes in section  [ sec : ed ] .",
    "we will study the propagation of singularities through the corresponding partial differential equations . as a result we can justify for the first time that light in a finsler spacetime",
    "indeed propagates along finsler null geodesics",
    ". we will conclude with a discussion and an outlook in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "as discussed above , the description of spacetime by finsler geometry is not straightforward and poses a number of open questions . in this section",
    "we will propose a new definition for finsler spacetimes to answer these .",
    "we will comment on the physical motivation and the immediate consequences of our definition , and on the interpretation of physical fields on finsler spacetime . then , in section  [ sec : geometry ] , we will introduce the mathematics of the cartan non - linear connection and curvature , before we exhibit the causal structure of finsler spacetimes in section  [ sec : causal ] .",

    "@xmath32    from the physical point of view finsler spacetimes guarantee the following desirable features :    a geometric clock postulate along observers worldlines can be defined by the finsler length integral  ( [ eqn : flength ] ) .",
    "this proper time measurement will be positive because of  ( b ) .",
    "moreover , the finsler length is reparametrization - invariant due to  ( c ) , which ensures that proper time is an intrinsic geometric quantity .",
    "finsler spacetimes are symmetric under time - reversal because proper time is in particular invariant under reparametrizations with orientation reversal . to see this ,",
    "consider a worldline @xmath0 in @xmath1 and a reparametrization @xmath33 with @xmath34 ; then @xmath35 so the proper time of a curve is indeed independent of the choice of orientation .",
    "we will see in section  [ sec : geometry ] that we can use @xmath4 to construct a connection , covariant derivative and the associated curvature on @xmath31 .",
    "this construction uses the standard mathematical tools of finsler geometry which are based on ( a ) and ( d ) .",
    "the relevance of @xmath23 and @xmath28 in the definition of finsler spacetimes @xmath20 is that they allow us to extend all necessary geometric objects to the larger domain @xmath36 .",
    "this extension covers the complete null structure of spacetime , which is of particular importance for physics :    all types of null and non - null finsler geodesics can be discussed on a finsler spacetime , so that we may obtain a clear understanding of its causal structure .    as part of the causal structure ,",
    "finsler spacetimes admit a clear definition of timelike vectors . these are needed as tangents of observer s worldlines .",
    "their existence at every point @xmath37 is guaranteed by the unit timelike condition  ( e ) that provides a shell @xmath38 of unit timelike vectors .",
    "indeed , @xmath39 is normalized by @xmath40 and is timelike with respect to the metric @xmath28 .",
    "this follows from ) is a consequence of euler s theorem for @xmath41-homogeneous functions @xmath42 .",
    "this theorem is used in several calculations in this article , and states that @xmath43 . ]",
    "@xmath44 which implies @xmath45 . on @xmath38 ,",
    "the signature of @xmath28 is @xmath46 and so the sign @xmath47 indeed defines the timelike direction . in section  [ sec : causal ] we will prove that the unit timelike condition implies that the timelike observer directions on a finsler spacetime form open convex cones .    in section [ sec :",
    "examples ] we will demonstrate in detail that a lorentzian metric manifold satisfies all requirements of our definition , and so is a special case of a finsler spacetime .",
    "we will see that it is not possible to model such a manifold using a finsler metric of globally constant signature , as prescribed in earlier definitions , e.g. in  @xcite . in the same section",
    "we will also discuss a more complicated example of a finsler spacetime where the full power of our new definition comes into play .",
    "this example could be of relevance for a covariant spacetime description for crystal optics ; it has @xmath48 and multiple signature changes in the finsler metric .",
    "again this is excluded by earlier definitions .",
    "finsler spacetimes in our sense are generalizations of lorentzian spacetimes .",
    "it is important to note that not all finsler functions discussed in the literature which have indefinite finsler metrics are covered by our definition of finsler spacetimes . as a specific example , consider the randers type finsler function @xmath49 which is often presented as a small departure from lorentzian metric geometry @xmath50 with non - vanishing one form @xmath51 .",
    "it is clear that no smooth function @xmath23 on @xmath52 and no real @xmath53 exist , so that @xmath54 . hence the above finsler function does not define a finsler spacetime in our sense . however , we can not regard this as a problem , because the finsler metric of the randers finsler function does not exist on the null cones of @xmath55 ; there , any finsler geometric description of physics , in particular of geodesic motion , will break down .    in contrast , the results of this paper will show that our definition of finsler spacetimes only admits those finsler functions for which we can control the physically relevant geometry . before we discuss this in detail in the following sections , we wish to comment on the interpretation of fields on finsler spacetime .      from the definition of finsler spacetime we immediately realize that the metric @xmath28 that appears as a generalization of the lorentzian metric depends on all tangent bundle coordinates @xmath9 , not only on the coordinates of the manifold .",
    "thus , in order to obtain consistent equations for physical fields @xmath56 on finsler spacetime , it is necessary that these fields also depend on all tangent bundle coordinates .",
    "we interpret @xmath57 as the field @xmath56 measured by an observer at the point @xmath37 with four - velocity @xmath58 , see figure  [ fig:0 ] . how fields @xmath57 are constructed as lifts from standard fields over @xmath1 is discussed in more detail in section  [ sec : actions ] .",
    ", width=288 ]    on lorentzian metric manifolds the observer s four velocity is responsible for the time  space split seen by the observer .",
    "with respect to this split the matter tensor field components are interpreted ; in electrodynamics , for instance , the components of the field strength are interpreted as the electric and magnetic fields .",
    "on finsler spacetimes the role played by the observer s four - velocity is more complicated : though it may still be responsible for a time ",
    "space split ( using orthogonality with respect to  @xmath28 ) , there is an additional dependence in the tensor field components .",
    "this implies a deformation of the definitions of fields for differently moving observers at the same spacetime point .",
    "in order to formulate physical theories on finsler spacetimes @xmath20 we need geometric objects such as connection , covariant derivative , curvature and tensor fields ; in this section we will briefly review the standard construction of these in finsler geometry  @xcite .",
    "these objects are immediately available on finsler spacetimes wherever the finsler metric exists and is non - degenerate ; according to our definition of the previous section this is the case on @xmath31 .",
    "the most important new result that we will prove here shows that all standard constructions can in fact be extended to the larger domain @xmath36 , which is a consequence of the existence of the smooth function @xmath23 with @xmath59 .",
    "in particular , this implies that all geometric objects are well - defined where @xmath60 , which will allow us to discuss null geodesics and light propagation .",
    "the finsler function @xmath4 is a function on the tangent bundle @xmath10 , but is supposed to describe the geometry of the manifold @xmath1 .",
    "we now wish to define distinguished tensor fields over @xmath10 , so - called d - tensors , that transform precisely like tensor fields over @xmath1 under induced coordinate transformations @xmath61 a d - tensor @xmath62 takes the general form @xmath63 in terms of the berwald basis of @xmath18 and the corresponding dual basis of @xmath64 , @xmath65 these bases split @xmath66 and @xmath67 into horizontal and vertical parts , respectively . in the definition of the berwald bases",

    "this connection is called the cartan non - linear connection and has coefficients @xmath74 where @xmath75 are the christoffel symbols calculated from the components @xmath76 of the finsler metric , using @xmath8-derivatives as usual .",

    "when we discuss lorentzian metric manifolds as a special case of finsler spacetimes in section  [ sec : examples ] , we will see that the cartan non - linear connection reduces to the levi - civita connection ; accordingly also the curvature is reduced to the usual riemann curvature .",

    "it will be shown that their definition implies a precise notion of timelike vectors that can be used to distinguish the tangents to observers worldlines .",

    "this immediately confirms the result @xmath128 .",
    "finally we will show the convexity of the set @xmath105 defined in the theorem .",
    "positivity of the normal curvatures implies positivity of the principal curvatures of @xmath38 .",
    "now the set @xmath129 is closed , connected and convex with boundary @xmath38 . because of the homogeneity of @xmath23 , we then conclude that for all @xmath130 the sets @xmath131 are closed , connected and convex .",

    "@xmath32    so finsler spacetimes provide a precise notion of timelike vectors : @xmath58 is called timelike if and only if @xmath133 .",
    "we will use these vectors in the following section to define timelike geodesics as the worldlines of observers .    since @xmath134 is an open convex cone",
    ", we may define the dual cone in @xmath135 by @xmath136 the dual cone is also open and convex , and clearly defines the set of physical momenta @xmath13 with positive energy with respect to an arbitrary observer , compare  @xcite .",
    "next we prove a result that characterizes in particular the boundary of the cone @xmath105 of timelike vectors . as in lorentzian metric geometry",

    "<S> we present a concise new definition of finsler spacetimes that generalize lorentzian metric manifolds and provide consistent backgrounds for physics . extending standard mathematical constructions known from finsler spaces </S>",
    "<S> we show that geometric objects like the cartan non - linear connection and its curvature are well - defined almost everywhere on finsler spacetimes , also on their null structure . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to describe the complete causal structure in terms of timelike and null curves ; these are essential to model physical observers and the propagation of light . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that the timelike directions form an open convex cone with null boundary as is the case in lorentzian geometry . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we develop action integrals for physical field theories on finsler spacetimes , and tools to deduce the corresponding equations of motion . these are applied to construct a theory of electrodynamics that confirms the claimed propagation of light along finsler null geodesics . </S>"
