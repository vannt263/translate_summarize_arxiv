    "the study of nonequilibrium phase transition universality classes is one of the most fundamental tasks of statistical physics @xcite .",
    "such phenomena may appear in models of population , epidemics , catalysis , cooperative transport @xcite and enzyme biology @xcite for example .",
    "for a long time only the universality class of the directed percolation ( dp ) @xcite has been known , but later it turned out that different classes may appear in other models ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the most prominent example occurs in one - dimensional systems exhibiting @xmath4 symmetrical absorbing states @xcite and parity conserving ( pc )  explicit or underlying  branching and annihilating random walk ( barwe ) dynamics ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) of the dual variables ( @xmath7 ) @xcite . for a review see @xcite .",
    "this class is also called as directed ising , dp2 or generalized voter model class .",
    "however understanding these phenomena involving a satisfying solution of the corresponding field theory is very rare . for barwe models field theory failed to give quantitatively precise results in one dimension @xcite because systematic epsilon expansion brakes down due to a second critical dimension at @xmath8 below @xmath9 .",
    "very recently an other field theory has been suggested and analyzed by numerical simulation of the langevin equation for systems exhibiting @xmath4 symmetric absorbing states @xcite .",
    "numerical approximations ranging from simulations @xcite to series expansions @xcite , cluster mean - field approximations @xcite and empty interval method @xcite established the values of critical exponents firmly .",
    "recently zhong et al.@xcite constructed a special parity conserving reaction - diffusion model ( hereafter we call it zam model ) . by studying it up to pair approximations they claimed , that cluster mean - field studies fail to reproduce the phase transition of the barwe model if one considers clusters which are not large enough .",
    "therefore one may arrive to the conclusion that cluster mean - field and especially the site mean - field solution break down generally in case of pc class transitions .",
    "however in that study the branching attempt probability ( @xmath10 ) was fixed to a finite value , so one should not expect to see the mean - field transition , which is known to occur at zero branching rate . in the present study",
    "we show that the cluster mean - field approximations can describe the the mean - field transition qualitatively well even for small cluster sizes if we do not exclude the neighborhood of the zero branching rate from the parameter space .",
    "these approximations are performed on one - dimensional clusters therefore for large cluster sizes @xmath0 one expects to see a convergence towards the pc class transition at @xmath11 .",
    "we apply coherent anomaly extrapolations for the sequence of cluster mean - field results and give estimates for some exponents of the critical behavior in one dimension .",
    "the interplay of diffusion and fluctuation has already been shown in many reaction - diffusion models ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "although the diffusion is unable to change the universal behavior it can affect the location of the transition and even more it can change the stability of a fixed point in case of competing reactions @xcite ) . to investigate the possible role of diffusion",
    "we also extend the parameter space by modifying the diffusion rate .",
    "the generalized ( cluster ) mean - field ( gmf ) method is an extension of the usual mean - field calculation by setting up master equations for @xmath12-point configuration probabilities of site variables @xmath13 @xmath14 where the function @xmath15 depends on the transition rules of @xmath16 `` block probabilities '' at time @xmath17 .    at the level of @xmath0-point approximation the correlations are neglected for @xmath18 , that is , @xmath19 is expressed by using the bayesian extension process @xcite , @xmath20 in principle , @xmath21 parameters are required to define the probability of all the @xmath0-point configurations .",
    "this number , however , is drastically reduced by the following conditions : in the stationary state the particle distribution is assumed to be symmetric with respect to translation and reflection .",
    "furthermore , the block probability consistency results in : @xmath22    here we apply gmf for one - dimensional , site restricted lattice versions of barwe . taking into account spatial the symmetries in case of the @xmath23 gmf approximation one has to find the solution of equations of 528 independent variables .",
    "this has been achieved with the help of mathematica software .",
    "we required 20 digit accuracy in the results and arbitrary precision during the calculations .",
    "it is well known that such approximations predict the phase structure qualitatively well in one dimension , provided @xmath0 is large enough to take into account the relevant interaction terms .",
    "for example @xmath24 is needed to take into account particle diffusion terms , while @xmath25 was found to be necessary in case of binary production processes involving pair induced reactions @xcite .",
    "the gmf is an efficient phase diagram exploration method and although it is set up for the @xmath26 lattice in previous cases it provided qualitatively good phase diagram for higher dimensional , mean - field versions as well ( see example @xcite ) .",
    "in @xcite zhong et al . defined a special , one - dimensional , parity conserving lattice model in which each site is either empty or singly occupied .",
    "the state of the lattice is updated asynchronously by the following rules : an occupied site is chosen randomly and it is tried for diffusion , at rate @xmath27 ( probability @xmath28 ) , or branching , at rate @xmath29 ( probability @xmath30 ) ; while the time is increased by @xmath31 , where @xmath0 is the number of occupied ( active ) sites . in a diffusion step the particle jumps to its randomly chosen nearest neighbor sites . if the site is occupied both particles are annihilated with probability @xmath32 . on the other hand",
    "the jump is rejected with probability @xmath33 .",
    "the branching process involves the creation of two new particles around the neighborhood .",
    "if either , or both neighboring sites is previously occupied the target site(s ) become empty with probability @xmath32 .",
    "otherwise the lattice remains unaltered with probability @xmath33 .",
    "the site mean - field equation for the concentration @xmath34 ( probability of site occupancy ) is @xmath35 where @xmath36 was taken , hence the branching probability is fixed to @xmath37 . similarly the @xmath38 pair mean - field approximation was solved and in both cases",
    "the system always evolves to an active phase with finite concentration @xmath39 ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "these results were compared with those of the @xmath40 rate model in one dimension , for which pc class continuous phase transition is known at @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the conclusion was drawn that cluster mean - field approximations of low orders fail to reproduce the phase diagram , the convergence is very slow and the calculations are complicated .",
    "however it is also known that in the mean - filed approximation  which is valid for @xmath42 dimensions  the phase transition occurs at zero branching rate @xcite , so it is not surprising that by fixing @xmath43 one does not see a phase transition in the corresponding mean - field approximations . on the other hand zhong",
    ". found a phase transition for @xmath44 by the parity interval method  which also involves a mean - field like approximation  set up for this one - dimensional model @xcite .",
    "the authors acknowledged that it had been possible to see the phase transition in related pc class models for larger ( @xmath25 ) cluster sizes @xcite .    to clarify this we extended the cluster mean - field method for higher orders and for other versions of this barwe model exhibiting pc class transition .",
    "we determined the steady state solutions of eq.([mastereq ] ) taking into account eqs.([eq : bayes],[eq : prob ] ) and calculated the corresponding steady state densities @xmath45 ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "indeed higher levels of approximations ( @xmath46 ) of the zam model result in phase transition with @xmath47 converging towards the simulations ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "as we saw in the preceding section cluster mean - field approximations of the zam model give qualitatively good phase diagram for @xmath49 and the steady state solutions converge to the mc simulations .",
    "however going much further with the gmf study of the zam model is time consuming especially because the numerical root finding of eq.([mastereq ] ) gets computationally demanding for large number of variables . on the other hand by modifying the zam model slightly in such a way that zero branching rate is allowed with the restriction @xmath50 ( zamb ) one immediately finds the expected mean - field transition at @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "the site approximation equation for the concentration is @xmath53 exhibiting the steady state solution @xmath54 for @xmath40 . for @xmath55 eq.([zambeq ] ) simplifies to @xmath56 resulting in @xmath57 particle density decay in agreement with the mean - field expectations .",
    "the supercritical behavior in the active phase can be characterized by @xmath58 leading order singularity for @xmath59 @xmath60 and @xmath61 correction to scaling exponent defined as @xmath62    the steady - state solution has been determined for @xmath63 ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "as one can see even the pair approximation gives @xmath64 , but for @xmath25 the transition point starts shifting towards the true transition point @xmath65 as expected in one dimension .",
    "one can also observe a concave shape of the curves corresponding to the corrections to scaling with @xmath61 exponent .",
    "in previous papers @xcite ) it was shown that the diffusion strength can cause relevant effects on the phase diagram of reaction - diffusion models when it competes with the reactions .",
    "this is reflected in the cluster mean - field approximations in such a way that stronger diffusion `` washes out '' fluctuations and causes a transition , which is more site mean - field like , while higher @xmath0 takes into account more fluctuations , hence opposes the effects of the diffusion .",
    "here we investigated the effect of diffusion by lowering the hopping probability of the zamb model to @xmath66 .",
    "the steady state results ( fig.[fig3 ] ) show that the concentration curves arrive with higher slopes to the @xmath67 axis than in case of @xmath68 .",
    "this permits us to obtain @xmath69 more precisely since the relative error of the amplitudes is smaller and the quadratic correction to scaling is weaker . as the consequence",
    "the numerical root finding is not so much affected by basin of attraction of the absorbing state fixed point solution .",
    "note that in the pair approximation the linear amplitudes @xmath70 are zero .",
    "by applying fitting with the expected scaling form @xmath71 to the gmf data one can determine the location of the transition and @xmath72 simultaneously . for @xmath68",
    "this gives @xmath73 , while for @xmath74 @xmath75 .",
    "however to obtain better critical value estimates we used more precise @xmath76 values in the fitting procedure , which can be deduced from simulations .",
    "the simulations were performed on one - dimensional lattices of sizes @xmath77 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the runs were started from half filled lattices with randomly distributed particles .",
    "one elementary monte carlo step ( mcs ) consists of the following processes .",
    "a particle and a direction are selected randomly . if the nearest neighbour ( nn ) in the selected direction was empty the particle moves to it ( with probability @xmath78 ) .",
    "if it was filled , both particles are removed ( with probability @xmath32 ) . the time  measured by mcs  is updated by @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the total particle number at time @xmath17 . to perform the branching another particle",
    "is selected randomly ( with probability @xmath33 ) .",
    "depending on the status of the two nn ( @xmath81,@xmath82 ) the following process may occur .",
    "\\a ) if @xmath83 , two new particles are created .",
    "\\b ) if @xmath84 the two nn particles are removed with probability @xmath32 .",
    "\\c ) if @xmath85 the nn are swapped with probability @xmath32 .",
    "the time ( @xmath17 ) is updated by @xmath79 again .",
    "the simulations were followed up to @xmath86 ( mcs ) or until @xmath87 ( absorbing state ) .",
    "the concentration of particles @xmath88 times the expected density decay power - law @xmath89 @xcite is plotted on fig.[figmc ] .",
    "one can read - off @xmath90 for @xmath68 and @xmath91 for @xmath92 . for @xmath68",
    "this agrees well with the extrapolation results of ( eq.([rcscale ] ) ) , but for @xmath92 the deviation is not negligible .",
    "according to scaling theory the location of the critical point for sizes @xmath0 ( @xmath93 ) scales ( in the large @xmath0 limit ) as eq.([rcscale ] ) .",
    "precise extrapolation can be obtained by applying the critical transition point values of simulation in the mentioned scaling form .",
    "the @xmath93 for the @xmath0-th level of approximations was determined by quadratic fitting for @xmath94 .",
    "figure [ figcam ] shows @xmath93 as the function of @xmath31 .",
    "the fit of form ( [ rcscale ] ) yields @xmath95 for @xmath68 and @xmath96 for @xmath92 ( see fig.[figcam ] ) .",
    "the value @xmath2 , agrees well with the value from the literature @xmath97 @xcite for this class .",
    "we applied the coherent anomaly method ( cam ) @xcite for the @xmath0-cluster gmf results to extrapolate to the @xmath98 behavior .",
    "this method has been proven to be successful for obtaining critical exponents of nonequilibrium absorbing phase transitions @xcite .",
    "earlier the gmf+cam method was already used for analyzing the pc class transition of the nekim @xcite up to @xmath99 cluster sizes .",
    "that study arrived to the rough estimate @xmath100 , which agrees with the the series expansion result @xmath101 @xcite and the simulation results marginally @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "now we apply this method for cluster sizes up to @xmath103 and improve the gmf+cam results @xcite for a model pc exhibiting pc class transition . according to cam the amplitudes @xmath69 of the cluster mean - field singularities @xmath104 scale in such a way @xmath105 that the exponent of the true singular behavior ( eq.([truebeta ] ) )",
    "can be estimated .",
    "the @xmath69 amplitudes were determined by linear fitting to the local slopes of the @xmath106 data in the neighborhood of @xmath93 .",
    "the amplitudes are shown in table [ tab ] and in the insert of fig .",
    "[ figcam ] .",
    "the fitting using form eq.([anoscal ] ) for @xmath25 data ( since @xmath107 ) results in @xmath108 for @xmath68 and @xmath3 for @xmath92 .",
    "the cam for @xmath68 results in bigger numerical error than for @xmath92 , because for @xmath68 the quadratic corrections to scaling are stronger and the @xmath45 numerical solutions are affected by the attractive basin of the neighboring absorbing state fixed point .",
    "these values agree well with the simulation results @xmath102 @xcite , @xmath109 @xcite as well as with that of the parity interval method @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "we showed that even low order gmf approximations can describe the phase transition of an even - offspringed barw model correctly if one allows appropriate parameterization .",
    "we applied gmf approximations for a one dimensional site restricted lattice model . by allowing to reach the zero branching rate in the zam model we showed that the site mean - field solution is in agreement with that of the field theory for this class @xcite .",
    "note that this kind of analysis resulted in similar steady - state solutions in case of an other pc class model @xcite , although there the branching rate ca nt be read - off explicitly .    the gmf approximations were determined up to @xmath111 and convergence towards the simulation results were shown . using scaling and cam theory we obtained @xmath2 and @xmath3 critical value estimates matching the best precision available in the literature for the pc universality class .",
