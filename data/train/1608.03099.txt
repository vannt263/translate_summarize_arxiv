    "during run i of the lhc , the modifications of jets due to re - scattering in the dense medium created in heavy ion collisions have been studied mostly in single - inclusive jet observables and di - jet events .",
    "they are dominated by pure qcd production processes , which have by far the largest cross sections . however , in these events it is practically impossible to determine the hard scattering kinematics , as all jets undergo quenching in the medium .",
    "this is different in @xmath2+jet processes , where a hard jet recoils against an electroweak gauge boson .",
    "the bosons  and in the cases of @xmath1 and @xmath3 production the leptonic decay products  do not interact strongly and thus escape unmodified from the medium .",
    "this has been confirmed by measurements of inclusive vector boson production in pb+pb collisions at the lhc  @xcite , which show that the observed rates are consistent with binary scaling and nuclear pdfs .",
    "the boson thus allows us to experimentally access the hard scattering kinematics .",
    "however , due to qcd corrections , in particular initial state radiation , the boson s and the parton s transverse momentum do not match exactly and the @xmath4 ratio fluctuates considerably from one event to another ( cf .",
    "[ fig : ypjet_xjy ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , since the initial parton @xmath4 is known on average , boson - jet processes provide valuable information that is complementary to pure qcd processes .",
    "first measurements  @xcite are still limited by statistics , but this will improve in future lhc running .",
    "there have also been attempts to study @xmath0-hadron correlations at rhic  @xcite , but these are much more sensitive to poorly constrained hadronisation effects as opposed to jets .",
    "the theoretical description of jet quenching in boson - jet events is the same as in pure jet events , in some approaches boson - jet  @xcite or @xmath0-hadron  @xcite observables have been discussed specifically .",
    "we here present an extension of jewel to boson - jet processes . after a summary of the new features , we compare jewel to boson - jet data from lhc run i and ii .",
    "jewel  @xcite is a fully dynamical perturbative framework for jet quenching .",
    "it describes the simultaneous scale evolution of hard partons giving rise to jets and res - scattering in the medium .",
    "partons belonging to the jet undergo collisions with partons from the thermal background .",
    "these interactions are described by @xmath5 matrix elements and parton showers and can thus be elastic or inelastic , where the two types of interactions occur with the ( leading log ) correct relative rates . whenever there are competing sources of radiation , the emission with the shorter formation time is realised .",
    "this means that only sufficiently hard re - scatterings can perturb the scale evolution of the hard jet production process and induce additional radiation . in this way",
    "hard structures inside jets remain unchanged .",
    "all scattering processes within the formation time of a medium - induced emission act coherently , which means that only the vectorial sum of the momentum transfers matters for the gluon emission .",
    "this is the qcd analogue of the landau - pomerantchuk - migdal effect , which is also implemented in jewel  @xcite .    for jet evolution in vacuum jewel",
    "reduces to a standard virtuality ordered final state parton shower .",
    "initial state parton showers , hard jet production matrix elements , hadronisation and hadron decays are generated by pythia6.4  @xcite .    in the extended version",
    "we have included processes with a jet recoiling against a vector boson .",
    "the corresponding diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : production ] .",
    "these correspond to either a quark scattering off a gluon ( compton scattering ) or a quark  anti - quark pair annihilating to produce a boson and a gluon . for photons ,",
    "the box diagram @xmath6 is also included .",
    "the leptonic decays of the heavy boson @xmath1 and @xmath3 are simulated as well .",
    "+ jet processes included in jewel , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    hard photons can also be radiated off quarks during jet evolution .",
    "these fragmentation photons are typically accompanied by hadronic activity and are suppressed by requiring the photon to be isolated .",
    "however , it is still possible that fragmentation photons pass the isolation criterion .",
    "the probability for this to happen is small and depends on the cuts .",
    "it has to the best of our knowledge not been quantified in a heavy ion environment in the presence of jet quenching . in the current jewel version fragmentation photons",
    "are also not included .",
    "for the analyses shown here the fragmentation component is expected to be small due to the applied photon isolation .",
    "jewel is a leading - order framework .",
    "while nlo corrections to @xmath2+jet processes can be sizeable , in the observables shown here corrections affecting only the cross section largely cancel due to the normalisation to number of bosons or number of boson - jet pairs .",
    "the corrections to differential distributions remain , but are typically smaller .",
