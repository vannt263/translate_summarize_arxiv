    "the interaction between electrons and ion vibrations is responsible for many fundamental phenomena in solids .",
    "for example , as shown in bcs theory in electron - phonon(ep ) interaction induces a weak attraction between electrons near fermi surface with opposite momenta and opposite spins and eventually leads to superconductivity@xcite . in quasi one - dimensional materials",
    "it is well known that ep coupling usually causes metal - insulator transition . in the insulating phase",
    "a band gap opens at the fermi energy and simultaneously lattice is distorted resulting in a larger unit cell .",
    "this transition is called peierls transition@xcite .    for simplicity",
    "most of theoretical works consider only harmonic ion vibration and in only a few works higher orders are taken into account .",
    "for example , the effect of anharmonicity on superconductivity was studied by freericks et al.@xcite more than ten years ago in infinite - dimensional limit .",
    "however , it seems that the anharmonicity represented by the quartic term does not enhance the superconductivity transition temperature as expected .",
    "another example is that polaronic properties with anharmonicity were investigated by chatterjee and takada@xcite some time ago .",
    "recently a renewed interest in anharmonic ion vibration was raised in @xmath0-pyrochlore oxides , especially in kos@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "experiments show that it has unusual behaviors in both normal state and superconductivity state@xcite .",
    "in kos@xmath1o@xmath2 an os - o network forms a oversized cage and k ion sits in the cage . as the mass of k ion is small compared with rb or cs it oscillates relatively far from the equilibrium position .",
    "density functional theory shows that this movement is highly anharmonic and the harmonic term of the potential can even be zero or negative@xcite .",
    "some of the anomalous behaviors observed in kos@xmath1o@xmath2 was explained by dahm and one of the present authors by treating the anharmonic ion vibration in a quasi - harmonic approximation with temperature - dependent frequency . @xcite .",
    "the spectral function and nmr relaxation rate have been discussed for a model with a general anharmonic potential@xcite .",
    "otsuka et al@xcite has consider the effect of static anharmonic potential on quasi - one - dimensional extended hubbard model and rich phase diagrams have been found at finite temperature .",
    "however , in quasi - one - dimensional materials , phonon fluctuation is usually important@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will use the one - dimensional spinfull holstein model as a prototypical model to study the effects of anharmonicity of ion vibrations .",
    "since here we are more interested in the anharmonicity the model we will study is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the momentum and position operator of ions at site @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the potential energy of ion vibration with @xmath8 being the lattice size .",
    "@xmath9 is always nonnegative so that the ion potential is bounded .",
    "@xmath10 is the hopping term of electrons onto nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "@xmath11 is the spin index and in our work we only consider spinful model and then @xmath11 takes two values @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 is the creation(annihilation ) operator for an electron at site @xmath6 with spin index @xmath11 , @xmath14 is the electron number operator at site @xmath6 for spin @xmath11 .",
    "the electrons couple locally with ions and the coupling constant is given by @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 is the chemical potential for controlling the electron number .",
    "if @xmath17 hamiltonian @xmath18 is invariant under the particle - hole transformation @xmath19 and thus it is always half - filled at @xmath17 .",
    "if @xmath20 hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) reduces to the _ standard holstein model_. in the past several decades it has been extensively studied by many authors . the mean - field theory and",
    "the expansion from the strong coupling limit predict that at half - filling for spinless case there is a phase transition from a disorder phase to a dimerized phase while for spinful case the ground state is dimerized for any finite ep coupling and any finite phonon frequency@xcite .",
    "however , the latter conclusion was challenged by wu et al@xcite .",
    "based on functional integral analysis they argued that the fluctuation of phonons could also destroy the dimerization for spinful case when @xmath15 is smaller than a critial @xmath21 . this conclusion was confirmed later by accurate density - matrix renormalization group calculations@xcite as well as quantum monte carlo simulations@xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear yet what is the effect of anharmonicity @xmath22 in one dimension . in particular ,",
    "if the harmonic term @xmath23 is zero or even negative , the ion potential becomes double - well .",
    "then a natural question is whether there are some fundamental changes compared with the harmonic case ? in the following we will clarify these issues by investegating the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) by using the determinant quantum monte carlo simulations@xcite .",
    "in this model the electrons of two spin species couple equally to ions , so there is no sign problem . in our simulations",
    "the largest lattice size is up to 32 and finite - size scaling is used to extrapolate our results to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the inverse temperature @xmath0 is up to 24 .",
    "we check our results with different @xmath0 to confirm that the temperature in our simulation is low enough to extract ground state properties .",
    "the time slice @xmath24 is used in most of our simulations and we also check the results carefully by calculations with smaller @xmath25 and confirm that the results are not sensitive to @xmath25 .    in this paper",
    "we consider only the half - filled case by putting @xmath17 .",
    "moreover for simplicity we also fix @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in section",
    "ii , firstly we will take @xmath28 , and show the results as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "we find that for both @xmath20 and finite @xmath9 there is a phase transition from the disordered phase to the dimerized phase .",
    "the dimerization occurs accompanied by the charge density wave(cdw ) transition simultaneously .",
    "secondly we show the phase diagram in @xmath29 plane .",
    "finally we show the order parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 as a function of @xmath23 with fixed @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "similarly , a transition from the dimerized cdw phase to the disordered phase is found . in section iii , we will present results on static charge structure factor and spin structure factor .",
    "these data confirm our previous conclusions . by calculating correlation exponents",
    ", we find that for any finite @xmath15 there is a spin gap .",
    "however , a charge gap opens only after @xmath34 , or @xmath35 . in section iv",
    ", we summarize our results .",
    "since hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) with @xmath20 has been extensively studied then we will focus on the case with a finite @xmath9 in this work .",
    "data for @xmath20 are calculated just for comparison with the dmrg results@xcite .",
    "when @xmath9 is larger than zero the anharmonic term increases the elastic energy of ion .",
    "therefore a straightforward conjecture is that it will suppress the dimerization as well as the cdw order . in the first step",
    "we examine how the order parameters change as a function of @xmath15 when the anharmonic term @xmath9 is introduced . for our purpose",
    "we define the staggered correlation function of lattice displacements @xmath36 and the staggered correlation function of the electron densities @xmath37 the order parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 are correspondingly defined as @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath40 is expected to be finite in the dimerized phase while it is zero in the disorder phase .",

    "in particular , @xmath54 is smaller than @xmath55 .",
    "it is plausible to say that the anharmonic potential @xmath9 has `` stronger '' suppression on the ion dimerization than on the cdw formation . in fig .",

    "[ fig4 ] . in this figure",
    "we see that when @xmath56 the ground state is in the dimerized cdw phase while for @xmath57 it is in the disorder phase .",

    "moreover , the height of the peak is found to be finite in both @xmath49 and @xmath66 .",
    "we then conclude that in this model there is a dominant short - range @xmath72 spin correlation in both the disorder phase and the dimerized phase .",
    "next we will analyse the charge and spin correlation exponents @xmath58 and @xmath59 . since our model is invariant under spin rotation , we expect that if it is in the tll phase @xmath59 is equal to 1 .",

    "this quantity is quite sensitive to the opening of a spin gap and therefore we use it as a criterion to determine whether there is a spin gap or not . in the top panel of fig .",
