    "first of all , the ultimate goal of this research was to correct one big error comming from the traders community : it s to trust the technical indicators like they trust there parents .",
    "they do nt understand that it s just a mathematical tool that they have to master ! for exemple , if the rsi is at the 90 level , that s not automatically the sign of a reversal price action .",
    "it s just the result of some arithmetic operations .",
    "the price action is a random walk ( the next price is not dependant of the historical data but he only depands of the actual price ) .",
    "+   + secondly , i analyzed the daily returns of two different stocks ( rimm and aapl ) .",
    "the importation and the analyze of data was with r because of the simplicity of that programmation language .",
    "i test the normality for the aapl density function to use it for evaluating the probability of gain . because we know that it s normally distributed",
    ", we can get a probability number going with the actual daily return of a stock ( with the standard score ) .",
    "+   + to understand my model , you have to know some basic concepts of statistics .",
    "after this , all you have to do is to apply what you learned to a time serie and the job is done !      if x and y are two random variables , then the variance of each variable is @xmath0 @xmath1  if we take the square root of both sides , we get the standard deviation",
    ".    @xmath2    @xmath3     +  the covariance between two jointly distributed real - valued random variables x and y is defined as @xmath4  then , the correlation factor is equal to @xmath5      let s define the standard score :  @xmath6  because we are using a sample , the formula will be a little bit different @xmath7  @xmath8 is the mean of the data for the sample and @xmath9 is the quantity of data we have .",
    "the returns of one stock are simply expressed by the next ratio @xmath10 +  @xmath11 is the yesterday s close and @xmath12 is the today s close because our primary interest is the daily returns .",
    "we are going to modelize the price action with r.      in statistics , the shapiro ",
    "wilk test tests the null hypothesis that a sample @xmath13 came from a normally distributed population .",
    "the test is : @xmath14 @xmath15  where @xmath16  and @xmath17 are the expected values of the order statistics of independent and identically distributed random variables sampled from the standard normal distribution , and @xmath18 is the covariance matrix of those order statistics .",
    "we may reject the null hypothesis if w is too small ( w @xmath19 )",
    "in this part , we are going to explain how can we forecast the absolute variation of two stocks . why apple and research in motion ?",
    "because they are relatively popular these days and the article will be more concrete .",
    "let s begin with getting data from the yahoo ! finance server . in r , we have to install the quantmod package .",
    "@xmath20  then , we have to require it @xmath21  we are now able to get our data . for the purpose of this example , we select the data from the beginning of the year .  @xmath22  @xmath23  from now , the data are loaded and we need to define two variables for the daily returns .",
    "@xmath24  @xmath25  to visualize the returns , we need to plot @xmath26 or @xmath27 .",
    "let s do it for @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath28    we can test the normality of that distribution with the shapiro  wilk test .",
    "the first thing we have to do is to plot the density of @xmath26 with r. @xmath29 +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +  to be able to test the normality of this time serie , we have to calculate @xmath30 .",
    "but , before the computation , we have to specify the vector we want to test .",
    "@xmath31  @xmath32 @xmath33    the qq plot graph gives us something like that",
    "+   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +  we can conclude that @xmath34 is normally distributed .  with this information",
    ", we can calculate the standard deviation with the formula @xmath35 .",
    "+  the standard deviation is @xmath36  the second standard deviation will be @xmath37  then , we add this number to the @xmath38 graph @xmath39 @xmath40     +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +  with the normal distribution , we know that approximately 5 % of the data is out of the region : @xmath41 . in this case , we can trade the stock when the actual return is out of this region with a very good probility of returning in the critical zone .",
    "the daily return function can be returning in the positive or negative zone .",
    "78.2 % of the tested stocks returned in the positive zone when they was not in the critical region .",
    "the concrete application is : when a stock is getting a high return one day above @xmath42@xmath43@xmath42 of the last year , there is a high probability that the next day , the return will be positive . for exemple ,",
    "rimm is 12.1 % today and @xmath43 of the last year is equal to 0.045 .",
    "then we should trade rimm tomorow and expect a return of something between 0 % and 4.5 % .",
    "+      to be sure that our data of returns is correct , let s check the correlation between the returns of our stock and the returns of nasdaq .",
    "all the steps will be with r again .",
    "@xmath44  @xmath45  @xmath46 + we get a correlation of 0.6587 .",
    "the result tells us that aapl and ixic are correlated at 65.87 % ( a regular result because aapl is a major stock in nasdaq and the correlation are supposed to be greater than 50 % ) .      in this section",
    ", we are going to define one differential equation that describe the momentum in the daily return graph .",
    "we know that , in physics @xmath47  in finance , the momentum ( acceleration in physics ) is described by @xmath48  we can solve this differential equation by integrating both sides @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51  if @xmath52 , then the daily return of the next day is equal to @xmath53  with this linear equation , we have to know the slope @xmath54 , the actual date ( @xmath55 ) and the today s return(@xmath56 ) .",
    "we can find @xmath54 by doing the next operation for previous points",
    "@xmath57  these informations are available in r with the function @xmath58",
    "i will devide the conclusion section in two parts : the first part will put some conclusions into my results and the second will give you a new idea to continue this algo with fastest and better results . +   +  first of all , i find two stocks who has normaly distributed daily returns and i prove it .",
    "it s a very important step ( to prove it ) because if you do nt , you ca nt put any probability law into it and you will not be able to estimate any probability number .",
    "we consider that our sample data is representative .",
    "we also consider that the daily returns we got has a markovian process ( a markov process can be thought of as memoryless : loosely speaking , a process satisfies the markov property if one can make predictions for the future of the process based solely on its present state just as well as one could knowing the process s full history .",
    "i.e. , conditional on the present state of the system , its future and past are independent ) ] .",
    "if we concretize all that : the daily return of tomorrow is only depends on the today s daily return with the initial conditions .",
    "we also talked about the standard score : to know what stock to trade if the initial conditions are respected , you have to take the double of standard deviation of the last year and apply it to this year . for exemple ,",
    "if yhoo have a daily return of @xmath59 today and @xmath60 of last year is @xmath61 , then , you have to take the trade tomorrow .",
    "the backtesting of 3 stocks in r shows us that with this algo , the probability of the daily return function for returning in a positive zone is 0.7820 ( witch is a pretty good probability ) .",
    "if the today s daily return of yhoo is @xmath62 , you have to do exactly the same thing that the positive case because we have a good probability of returning in positive zone .",
    "the expected daily return of this algo is between @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "i also have to specify that this algo was tested for day - trading . ]",
    "+   +  finally , i have one idea to optimize the algo .",
    "the idea is to test more than 500 stocks ( 3 years minimum of data for each stock witch include downtrend years and uptrend years ) to be very representative of the stock market .",
    "the more stocks you analyze , the better are your predictions and the more efficient you are .",
    "i think it s a good idea to program something that gives you the ticker of stocks that follow the initial conditions and the standard score condition . with that , you can filter the stocks that do not match with your own conditions and only trade the optimal stocks .    1 sheldon m. ross , _ introduction to probability models _ , academic press , 2010 .",
