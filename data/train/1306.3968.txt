    ", studies on the temporal evolution of the excited state population were developed @xcite , and the inclusion of the doppler broadening to this problem was also considered @xcite .",
    "aspects involving accumulation of coherence in atomic excitation due to the sequence of pulses from a mode - locked laser was investigated by felinto _",
    "this coherent accumulation process has been studied in the regimes of electromagnetically induced transparency and coherent population trapping @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the coherent accumulation on shape and number of pulses was also investigated @xcite , and a theory of doppler cooling with a train of short pulses has been developed @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , two - photon transitions in cold rubidium atoms @xcite and velocity selective optical pumping in rubidium vapor @xcite both using femtosecond pulses were observed and modeled .",
    "further , a general theory for pulses with arbitrary shape interacting with multilevel systems has also been reported @xcite .",
    "the works mentioned above focused on the time domain to study the problem in question . in some cases , it is more intuitive , simpler and more practical to work in the frequency domain .",
    "for example , the saturated absorption spectroscopy in rubidium vapor with 10 ghz ti : sapphire laser @xcite is easily understood in terms of the interaction between a single mode of the frequency comb and the atomic system .",
    "in fact , early @xcite and recent works @xcite have also examined the excitation of atoms by pulse trains in the frequency domain .    in this paper , we focus our studies in the frequency domain and investigate in detail the response of a two - level system due to the interaction with the modes of the frequency comb . first ,",
    "in section 2 , we present the pulse train in the frequency domain .",
    "next , in section 3 , we solve the bloch equations in the weak field regime , and obtain an analytical solution for the coherence and population that explicitly contains the contribution of each mode of the frequency comb ( or of each comb line ) . with this perturbative solution",
    "we are able to analyze the effects of the number of modes @xmath0 near or at resonance ( see section 3 ) on the temporal evolution of the atomic coherence .",
    "these results are extended to inhomogeneously broadened atoms .",
    "further , in section 4 , we investigate the influence of @xmath0 when the interaction occurs in the regime of high intensity fields .",
    "for this condition , saturation effects or stark shift are important and the atomic response is obtained in the steady - state regime using numerical calculations . finally , our concluding remarks are presented in section 5 .",
    "we start by considering the equation for the amplitude of the electric field of a train of @xmath1 pulses with repetition interval @xmath2 , carrier frequency @xmath3 and pulse - to - pulse phase difference @xmath4 @xcite :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 defines the pulse envelope . taking the fourier transform of eq .",

    "we will solve the bloch equations for the atom - field interaction taking the electric field as given by eq .",
    "to study the atomic excitation driven by the pulse train , we use the density matrix formalism . for simplicity",
    ", we consider a two - level system , although this approach is also holds for systems with three @xcite or more levels .",
    "the temporal evolution of the excited state population ( @xmath18 ) and the coherence ( @xmath19 ) are governed by the bloch equations :    @xmath20                  \\frac{\\partial\\rho_{22}}{\\partial t } & = \\left[\\,i\\,\\frac{\\mu_{12}e(t)}{\\hslash}\\,\\rho_{12 } + \\mbox{c.c.}\\ , \\right ] - \\gamma_{22}\\,\\rho_{22 } ,   % \\\\ [ 0.3cm]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the relaxation rates of population and coherence , respectively , @xmath23 is the frequency of the atomic resonance , and @xmath24 represents the electric dipole moment .    in the following we use perturbation theory to solve eq .",
