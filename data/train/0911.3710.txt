    "ribo - nucleic acid ( rna ) is the only known bio - molecule that plays the dual role of being a carrier of genetic information ( from deoxyribose - nucleic acid ( dna ) to proteins ) and an enzyme in important biological reactions @xcite .",
    "the secondary structure of rna , excluding pseudoknots , has been a central subject of study for understanding folding of rna @xcite",
    ". however , experimental studies @xcite have shown that tertiary structures of rna play pivotal role in determining their biological functions . therefore , in order to understand the role that rna s play in biological processes it becomes essential to understand their folded conformations .",
    "the rna folding problem has been studied using a number of statistical models @xcite . in this work",
    "we study the effect of introducing an external interaction in a random matrix model of rna as rna in a cell participates in important genetic processes like transcription and translation , is surrounded by ions , comes in contact with cell walls , other molecules and organelles .",
    "these models are inspired from a theoretical model of rna which maps the rna folding problem onto a large @xmath5 matrix field theory @xcite where @xmath6 limit gives secondary structures and tertiary structures ( pseudoknots @xcite ) are obtained by finding corrections to @xmath7 terms in the partition function .",
    "the partition function can be expanded in powers of @xmath8 which gives a topological expansion , originally observed by g t hooft @xcite where planar and tertiary structures can be identified as terms with @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively ( @xmath11 is the genus of rna structures ) .",
    "thus random matrices give a natural way of arranging the rna structures according to their topology which is crucial to study the genus distribution functions of the model . here",
    "it is natural to introduce the chemical potential @xmath12 via the activity @xmath13 , then @xmath14 gives the planar diagrams and @xmath15 yields the maximum possible average @xmath11 .",

    "this physical connection has been elaborated on recently in @xcite    the random matrix model of rna in @xcite enumerates all planar structures along with the pseudoknots by making the following simplifying assumptions in the model of @xcite : ( i ) base pairings are not complementary _",
    "i.e. , _ they do not depend on the type and location of a monomer in the chain and have the same strength @xmath17 ( homopolymer ) and ( ii ) the chain is infinitely flexible .",
    "this enables us to count the rna structures with pseudoknots and also to observe how they evolve as the length of the chain is increased .",

    "i.e. , _ exact combinatorics of rnas with pseudoknots @xcite of a structure and its length have a linear relationship .",
    "this result observed for the real rnas , has been found in @xcite after a detailed analysis of rna sequences in the data banks , wwpdb and pseudobase . ] .",
    "however , the number of structures that have been discovered are a very small subset of the vast number of structures given by the matrix model . therefore , in order to study the effect of the surrounding environment on rna and its conformations , addition of a perturbation in the action of the random matrix model partition function of @xcite and to observe the changes is important .    as a first step , section 2 discusses an external linear interaction in the action of the partition function of the random matrix model in @xcite .",

    "the numbers in bracket of the legend ( in each plot ) correspond to the numerical @xmath1 values for the particular length curves.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] +    therefore , it is observed that as the length is increased , the plots ( for both @xmath151 and @xmath167 ) become more sharply peaked near @xmath1 . it is expected that as one goes to very large lengths ( of the order of hundreds of bases ) , the derivatives with respect to @xmath2 as a function of @xmath2 will be discontinuous as they approach ( i ) . @xmath173 and @xmath174 for @xmath175 and ( ii ) .",
    "@xmath174 and @xmath173 for @xmath172 when @xmath176 and @xmath177 respectively ( for the odd lengths see also fig .",
    "the transition for the odd and even lengths seem to be different . in order to completely establish the phase transition in these matrix models of rna and to make the numerical results presented here more concrete , a detailed analytical study for small @xmath3 and near @xmath1 is required .",
    "moreover , the appearance of a small @xmath3 even and odd behavior in the distribution functions , free energy and specific heat needs further understanding since these matrix models are models of rna and hence this phenomena is a possible prediction for real very small rnas ( very little experimental work has been done in this direction ) .",
    "an analytic calculation of the partition function after introducing a linear external perturbation in the action of the partition function of the random matrix model of rna in @xcite is given .",
    "a perturbation parameter @xmath2 is found which can be tuned to different values to get two different structural regimes in the model .",
    "the presence of different regimes was seen in the study of ( secondary structures of the ) rna - like polymer models @xcite . in this work ,",
    "different regimes are found with tertiary structures taken into account in addition to the secondary structures .",
    "the structural changes between two regimes with respect to @xmath2 can be defined as comprising of ( i ) .",
    "unpaired and paired base structures , in the regime @xmath0 and ( ii ) . completely paired base structures when @xmath178 .",
    "the regime ( i ) is like the molten phase of the rna structures shown by many statistical models of rna ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the fully paired regime corresponds to a range of structures ( similar to the fully paired regime discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "the general form of @xmath78 has terms weighted by powers of @xmath91 .",
    "the linear perturbation @xmath27 introduced in the action of the partition function in eq . ( 2 ) thus alters the contribution of unpaired bases as compared to the paired ones . in the linear interacting model picture , a physical effect which gives rise",
    "to @xmath179 can be the different surroundings of the cell in which the rna lives such as the presence of ions or molecules @xcite , then @xmath91 represents this change .",
    "the interaction introduced here may have other concrete realizations , for example in the pulling experiments ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the genus distributions at different @xmath3 , @xmath2 and genus @xmath11 exhibit small differences for , even and odd , short lengths with these differences disappearing at long lengths in the partition function .",
    "it is observed that the linear interacting matrix model is related via a scaling expression to the random matrix model of rna where the base pairing interaction strength @xmath17 has been re - scaled by @xmath141 .",
    "the two approaches are equivalent in this sense .",
    "the thermodynamic variables ( free energy and specific heat ) as a function of ( i ) . @xmath3 show a different even and odd length character present in the model , which may be of interest in the stretching experiments , ( ii ) . @xmath4",
    "show a different low and high temperature behavior in the free energy .",
    "the analysis of the free energy of the interacting matrix model with respect to @xmath2 shows a phase transition for the odd lengths and a sharp transition is expected for the large even lengths .",
    "a detailed analytic study of the phase transition reported here ( found numerically ) in these matrix models of rna is for a future work .",
    "the formalism gives a systematic analytical method of studying the effect of external interactions on the number of the planar and non - planar diagrams for a given @xmath3 and on their thermodynamic properties .",
    "these models are matrix models of rna which enumerate structures of all types that are possible for a given length of the chain .",
    "so the characteristics observed in the distribution functions and the thermodynamics , like the small @xmath3 even and odd behavior , should be found in some real rna s such as the micro - rna which are small with only 21 - 23 nucleotides .",
    "the results found here are also interesting in their own right purely from the point of view of random matrix theory .",
