    "mass transfer from the optical companion to the neutron star takes place through the equatorial circumstellar disk around the be star . though the neutron star spends most of the time away from the be circumstellar disk , during the periastron passage , abrupt mass accretion takes place resulting in periodic x - ray outbursts , known as type  i outbursts .",
    "the peak luminosity during these periodic outbursts is moderate ( @xmath4 erg s@xmath5 ; stella , white & rosner 1986 ) .",
    "the duration of these outbursts is in the range of a few days to a few tens of days .",
    "the bexbs occasionally show giant outbursts , known as type  ii outbursts .",
    "these outbursts are caused by the enhanced episodic outflow of the be star .",

    "the peaks corresponding to the spin frequency of the pulsar and its harmonics were ignored while fitting the pds continuum .",
    "the fit clearly showed the presence of a gaussian feature at @xmath041 mhz ( shown in figures  [ 1999_qpo ] & [ 2004_qpo ] ) .",

    "we obtained the ratio of the amplitude and uncertainty of the gaussian component and found the qpo feature is more than 3@xmath28 detection level .",
    "it may be noted that the exposure of individual @xmath2/pca observations were not very large ( poor signal - to - noise ratio ) which enhanced the error in the gaussian component and degraded the significance level of the qpo feature .",
    "however , the feature can be clearly seen in the pds as shown in one of the observations ( figure  [ 1999_qpo ] ) . while careful examining this @xmath041 mhz qpo during the three outbursts , it is found that the qpo frequency is variable in the range of 27 - 46 mhz and the significance level of the qpo was always in the range of 3@xmath28 - 8@xmath28 .",

    "these findings i.e. presence of multiple qpos at a particular epoch and the detection of qpos and its harmonics are very rarely seen in accretion powered x - ray pulsars .",
    "we calculated the quality factor @xmath29 ( qpo central frequency @xmath30/fwhm ( full width at half maximum ) ) of the all three qpos detected during 1999 , 2004 and 2008 outbursts and found to be in the range of 3 - 12 apart from three cases where it is in the range of 15 - 20 .",
    "the estimated value of @xmath29 is comparable to that in other high mass x - ray binaries ( 4 - 10 ) .",

    "the high value of q ( @xmath312 ) for the peak at @xmath041 mhz in the pds of 4u  0115 + 634   also confirms the feature to be a qpo .",
    "the rms values of the detected qpos in the @xmath2/pca observations were estimated and found to be in the range of 4% to 8% except the two observation of 1999 outburst where the rms value of 2 mhz qpo is quite high @xmath017% .",

    "as majority of the observations are not long enough , data from hexte instruments were not used in our analysis .",
    "out of 33 , 33 and 26 pointed @xmath2 observations of the pulsar during 1999 , 2004 and 2008 outbursts , spectral analysis were carried out for 29 , 27 and 24 observations , respectively .",

    "standard procedures were applied for the data selection , background estimation and response matrix generation ( naik & paul 2003 ) .",
    "data from available pcus were added together and response matrices were generated accordingly .",
    "we restricted our analysis to the 3 - 30 kev energy range . though the @xmath2 observations of the pulsar during 1999 outburst were analyzed to investigate the luminosity dependence of cyclotron resonance scattering features ( crsf ; nakajima et al .",
    "2006 ) , we used these observations in the context of understanding the change in spectral parameters and also qpo parameters with source flux .",
    "we used same spectral continuum model as used by nakajima et al .",
    "( 2006 ) such as the negative and positive power - law with exponential cutoff ( npex ) model along with the crsf while fitting the pulsar spectra during all three outbursts .",
    "the npex model is known to be the approximation of the unsaturated thermally comptonized plasma ( makishima et al .",
    "1999 ) . as described by nakajima et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , a crsf at @xmath011 kev and its harmonic are seen in the 3 - 30 kev energy spectra of the pulsar .",
    "the crsf energy was found to vary inversely with the pulsar luminosity which was interpreted as a result of decrease in the accretion column height due to the decrease in mass accretion rate ( nakajima et al .",
    "2006 ) .    as a detailed study on the luminosity dependence of crsf",
    "is already done , we attempted to investigate the change in other parameters with the source flux during above three outbursts .",
    "a representative energy spectrum of the pulsar obtained from the @xmath2 observation on 1999 march 14 is shown in figure  [ spec ] along with the best - fitting model and the residuals .",
    "we estimated source flux in 3 - 30 kev energy range along with the power - law photon index , high energy cutoff and equivalent hydrogen column density ( @xmath33 ) for all the 80 observations during three outbursts .",
    "considering the energy range of spectral fitting ( i.e. 3 - 30 kev ) , the value of estimated hydrogen column density may not be accurate enough to draw any reliable conclusion .",
    "random variation was seen in the values of power - law photon index with 3 - 30 kev source flux during 1999 and 2008 outbursts .",
    "similar variation in the values of photon index with the pulsar luminosity was reported earlier during the 1999 outburst earlier ( see table  4 of nakajima et al .",
    "however , during 2004 outburst , the photon index was found to be high at low source flux level .",
    "this should be noted here that during 2004 outburst , the pulsar was monitored with @xmath2/pca even after the outburst ( quiescent phase ) .",
    "the high value of power law photon index during quiescent phase suggests that the pulsar spectrum was relatively hard compared to that during the outburst phase . in figure  [ fl_qpo ] , we plotted the values of power law photon index and the rms ( % ) of qpos with the estimated source flux in 3 - 30 kev energy range during all three outbursts .",
    "it was found that the rms ( % ) of the qpo was variable in 3 - 8% range during all three outbursts except @xmath017% rms value of 2 mhz strong qpos of 1999 outburst .",
    "however , there was no systematic variation in the values of qpo rms during all three outbursts .",
    "the frequency of the qpos detected in accretion powered x - ray pulsars generally falls in the range of @xmath01 mhz to @xmath040 hz ( psaltis 2006 ) . among these binary pulsars ,",
    "the qpo features are detected more in transient sources compared to the persistent ones . in most of the transient",
    "be / x - ray binary pulsars , the detected qpos are found to be transient in nature .",
    "for example - in case of ks  1947 + 300 , the qpo feature was not seen in the data during 2000 and 2002 outbursts whereas it appeared at the end of the 2001 outburst ( james et al .",

    "another unique thing we detected in this work is the presence of multiple qpos simultaneously in the same observation at three occasions .",
    "qpos in accretion powered x - ray binary pulsars are thought to be due to the motion of the inhomogeneously distributed matter in the inner part of the accretion disk .",
    "the detection of qpos , therefore , provides useful information on the radius of the inner accretion disk and the interaction between accretion disk and the neutron star .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain the qpo features in the pds of accretion powered x - ray pulsars . according to the magnetospheric beat frequency model , the observed qpo frequency ( @xmath34 ) represent the beat between the coherent spin frequency of the pulsar ( @xmath35 ) and the keplerian frequency ( @xmath36 ) at the inner disk radius i.e. @xmath34 = @xmath37(r@xmath38 ) - @xmath39 , at the magnetospheric boundary of the pulsar ( alpar & shaham , 1985 ; lamb et.al .",
    "according to this model , interactions between the neutron star magnetosphere and its accretion disk result in fluctuations in the plasma density at the inner edge of the disk which rotates with the local keplerian frequency @xmath36(r@xmath40 . as the magnetic field lines of the neutron star rotate with its spin frequency @xmath35 , the fluctuation in plasma reappears with a frequency that is the beat frequency as given above . in keplerian - frequency model , on the other hand , the qpos arise because of the modulation of the x - rays by inhomogeniously distributed matter in the inner accretion disk at the keplerian frequency ( van der klis et al .",
    "according to this model , the observed qpo frequency is same as the frequency of the keplerian motion at the inner accretion disk ( i.e. @xmath34 = @xmath37(r@xmath38 ) ) . when the spin frequency of the pulsar is higher than the keplerian frequency at the inner edge of the accretion disk , mass accretion on to the neutron star is stopped at the magnetospheric boundary by centrifugal inhibition of accretion ( stella , white & rosner 1986 ) resulting in the onset of propeller effect",
    ". keplerian - frequency model , therefore , can be applicable only when the qpo frequency is above the neutron star spin frequency , as seen in transient bexb pulsars such as exo  2030 + 375 ( angelini , stella & parmar 1989 ) , a0535 + 262 ( finger et al .",
    "1996 ) , xte  j0111.27317 ( kaur et al . 2007 ) etc .",
    "however , in case of 4u  0115 + 634 , frequency of all three qpos ( earlier reported qpos at @xmath02 mhz and @xmath062 mhz and newly detected qpo at @xmath041 mhz ) are found to be less than the spin frequency of the pulsar .",
    "therefore , the keplerian - frequency model is not suitable to explain the presence of qpo in the transient pulsar 4u  0115 + 634 .",
    "third model proposed to explain the low - frequency qpo features in strongly magnetized ( @xmath010@xmath41 gauss ) accretion powered x - ray pulsars is the magnetic disk precession model ( shirakawa & lai 2002 ) . according to this model",
    ", the presence of qpos in binary pulsars is due to the magnetically driven disk warping / precession near the inner edge of the disk at the magnetospheric boundary .",
    "the magnetic torques due to interactions of the stellar field and the induced electric currents in the disk is responsible for warping and precession of the disk .",
    "this model was used to explain the mhz qpo detected in the accretion - powered pulsar 4u  1626 - 67 along with several others ( shirakawa & lai 2002 ) .",
    "this model was also attempted to explain the qpos in the transient pulsar 4u  0115 + 634 in terms of the presence of magnetically driven disk warping / precession around the neutron star .",
    "we reported the detection of a @xmath041 mhz qpo for the first time in the transient pulsar 4u  0115 + 634 .",
    "these newly detected qpos were present more frequently in decline phase of outbursts as compare to the rising phase ( figure  [ fg2 ] ) .",
    "these @xmath041 mhz qpos were found to be variable in 27 - 46 mhz frequency range .",
    "apart from the newly detected @xmath041 mhz qpo , qpos at @xmath02 mhz and @xmath062 mhz were also detected at several other occasions . however , there was no correlation between the qpo parameters and source flux during above three outbursts in the pulsar . in this work ,",

    "<S> we report the detection of quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) at @xmath041 mhz in the transient high - mass be / x - ray binary pulsar 4u  0115 + 634 using data from the @xmath1 observatory . the observations used in the present work were carried out during x - ray outbursts in 1999 march - april , 2004 september - october and 2008 march - april . </S>",
    "<S> this frequency of the newly detected qpo was found to vary in 27 - 46 mhz range . </S>",
    "<S> this @xmath041 mhz qpo was detected in four of the 36 pointed @xmath2 proportional counter array ( pca ) observations during 1999 outburst where as during 2004 and 2008 outbursts , it was detected in four and three times out of 33 and 26 observations , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> though qpos at @xmath02 mhz , and @xmath062 mhz were reported earlier , the @xmath041 mhz qpo and its first harmonic were detected for the first time in this pulsar . </S>",
    "<S> there are three @xmath2/pca observations where multiple qpos were detected in the power density spectrum of 4u  0115 + 634 </S>",
    "<S> . simultaneous presence of multiple qpos is rarely seen in accretion powered x - ray pulsars . </S>",
    "<S> spectral analysis of all the pointed @xmath2/pca observations revealed that the 3 - 30 kev energy spectrum was well described by negative and positive power - law with exponential cutoff ( npex ) continuum model along with interstellar absorption and cyclotron absorption components . during the three x - ray outbursts , however , no systematic variation in any of the spectral parameters other than the earlier reported anti - correlation between cyclotron absorption energy and luminosity was seen . </S>",
    "<S> presence of any systematic variation of qpo frequency and rms of qpo with source flux were also investigated yielding negative results .    </S>",
