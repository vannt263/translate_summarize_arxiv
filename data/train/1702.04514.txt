    "the development of a method to stabilize mode - lock lasers @xcite has lead to significant advances in time and frequency metrology .",
    "the resulting frequency comb obtained from such a stabilized mode - locked system has subsequently found many applications @xcite .",
    "these applications include some that are related to quantum information technology @xcite .",
    "such quantum information applications have closed the circle , by being applied to synchronization in time and frequency metrology @xcite . to this end , an understanding of the quantum properties of frequency combs can benefit time and frequency metrology in the improvement of accuracy . for this reason we stife here to provide a better description of the quantum state of frequency combs .",
    "our main focus here is to consider the effects of uncertainties in the frequency parameters of a frequency comb on its quantum state . while the quantum state is often consider as a pure state ( see for example @xcite ) , the uncertainties in the parameters imply that the effective quantum state is a mixed state . these uncertainties are associated with the temporal degrees of freedom of the state .",
    "both the particle - number degrees of freedom , which govern the photon statistics of the frequency comb source , and the temporal degrees of freedom are necessary to provide an accurate representation of the quantum state of a frequency comb laser source .    the popular way to represent quantum states that consist of multiple photons is to use continuous variables @xcite , leading to the wigner @xcite , husimi @xcite and glauber - sudarshan @xcite representations . however , these representations only address the particle - number degree of freedom .",
    "when the quantum state also involves other degrees of freedom , such as the frequency , as in this case , the representation of the quantum state becomes more involved . for a pure state",
    ", one can generalize the notion of a coherent state to incorporate the extra degree of freedom and use this to formulate the pure state in terms of such a representations ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "however , for a mixed state that includes another continuous degree of freedom , in addition to the particle - number degree of freedom , these generalizations fail . as a result , the wigner , husimi and glauber - sudarshan representations are not suitable for mixed states that need to be specified in terms of another degree of freedom , in addition to the particle - number degree of freedom . for this reason ,",
    "we first need to develop a quantum formalism in terms of which we can express the general mixed multi - photon quantum state of a frequency comb laser .    here",
    "we assume that , in the absense of any uncertainties in the frequency parameters of the frequency comb , the quantum state of the laser can be expressed as a generalized coherent state .",
    "the generalization incorporates the temporal degrees of freedom into the definitions of the fock states in terms of which the coherent state is defined .",
    "the uncertainties in the frequency parameters of the frequency comb turns the generalized coherent state ino a mixed state .",
    "we show that the temporal degrees of freedom in this mixed state are represented in the form of the power spectral density of the frequency comb .",
    "a mixed state is a convex sum over pure states @xmath0 where @xmath1 , so that @xmath2 are interpreted as probabilities . in a more general formalism , one can replace the summation with an integral @xmath3 in which @xmath4 is a continuous random variable that parameterizes the elements of the ensemble and @xmath5 is a probability density function , such that @xmath6    to incorporate the frequency degree of freedom , we define the pure single - photon states by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the ( stochastic ) frequency spectrum of the state .",
    "it is a function of the frequency @xmath9 , which is related to the angular frequency by @xmath10 , as well as a random variable @xmath4 , which labels the elements of the ensemble .",
    "the bra- and ket - vectors @xmath11 and @xmath12 represent a one - dimensional frequency basis , which obeys the orthogonality condition @xmath13 . using these definitions",
    ", we obtain the density operator for a single - photon @xmath14 where @xmath15 is interpreted as an ensemble average that gives a two - point correlation function in fourier space .",
    "although @xmath4 is shown here as a single random variable , the expressions can be generalized to an arbitrary number of random variables .",
    "one can convert the density operator into a density ` matrix ' ( density ` function ' ) in the fourier basis by operating on both sides with the frequency basis states @xmath16 the result indicates that the density matrix for the mixed single - photon state in the fourier basis is precisely the two - point correlation function in the fourier domain , obtained from the ensemble average .",
    "the trace of the density operator @xmath17 represents the normalization condition for the stochastic spectra @xmath8 . if we assume that @xmath18 for all elements of the ensemble ( all values of @xmath4 ) , then it leads to ( [ pkon ] ) which satisfies the normalization requirement .",
    "the spectra @xmath8 are related to real - valued stochastic time signals @xmath19 via the fourier transform @xmath20 usually , the time signals are of infinite duration .",
    "however , this can lead to divergences in the calculations , because time signals of infinite duration are not finite energy signals . due to parseval s theorem",
    ", the spectra would therefore also not be finite energy functions . as a consequence ,",
    "the quantum states would not be normalizable ; the trace of the density operator would diverge .",
    "it also means that the fourier transforms of such functions , as given in ( [ ft ] ) , are not well defined .",
    "it turns out that , if the system is stationary , in that its statistical charateristics do not change with time , then the quantum states that are associated with time signals of infinite duration ( and the two - point functions on which their definition is based ) can be calculated in a well - defined manner .",
    "first , we define the time integrals through a limit process @xmath21 where we introduce a simplified notation to denote this limit process .",
    "the two - point function now becomes @xmath22\\ { \\rm d}t_1\\ { \\rm d}t_2 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath23 is the autocorrelation function .",
    "if the random process is stationary ( shift invariant ) , the autocorrelation function will only depend on the difference between the variables @xmath24 .",
    "let s redefine one of the variables by @xmath25 .",
    "then the expression becomes separable @xmath26\\ { \\rm d}\\tau\\ { \\rm d}t_2 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\int_t \\exp[-{{\\rm i}}2\\pi ( \\nu-\\nu ' ) t_2]\\ { \\rm d}t_2\\ \\int_t r_g(\\tau ) \\exp[-{{\\rm i}}2\\pi \\nu \\tau]\\",
    "{ \\rm d}\\tau \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\epsilon(\\nu-\\nu ' ) s(\\nu ) , \\label{korfdef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27\\ { \\rm d}\\tau \\label{psddef}\\ ] ] is the power spectral density , which ( thanks to the wiener khintchine theorem ) is given by the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function , and @xmath28\\ { \\rm d}t , \\label{epsdef}\\ ] ] is a special function , as defined through a limit process .",
    "the properties of @xmath29 are discussed in [ epsfunk ] .",
    "it then follows that the density matrix is diagonal in the fourier basis @xmath30 the lack of off - diagonal elements indicates that , as expected , there is no mutual coherence between different frequency components .",
    "the density operator is given by @xmath31 ( note that a density operator given by @xmath32 , does not have a well - defined trace . )    the single - photon quantum state of the frequency comb can now be obtained by substituting the power spectral density into ( [ eenmeng2 ] ) .",
    "however , before we compute the power spectral density of the frequency comb , we first consider the multi - photon case .",
    "a fock state can be expressed as a single - photon state , raised to a given integer power . using the definition of the general pure single - photon state given in ( [ intoes ] )",
    ", we express the general fock state by @xmath34 where the combinatoric factor in front is required for normalization .",
    "generalizing it to mixed states , we proceed as before by assuming that the fourier domain wave function depends on a random variable @xmath8 .",
    "the mixed @xmath33-photon state is then defined in an analogous way as before , by @xmath35    in terms of the definitions of the single - photon state in ( [ intoes ] ) and the fock state in ( [ genfock ] ) , the expression for the mixed @xmath33-photon state becomes @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a higher order correlation function .",
    "if we assume that @xmath5 is a normal distribution , then the ensemble average in ( [ npuntdef ] ) breaks up into a product of two - point functions .",
    "if we further assume that the only nonzero two - point functions are those that contain @xmath38 with its complex conjugate , then there would be @xmath39 different ways to combine the @xmath38s with their complex conjugates .",
    "this gives a numerical factor of @xmath39 , which cancels the factor of @xmath40 in ( [ mixdefn0 ] ) .",
    "all the two - point functions are equal and given by ( [ korfdef ] ) . in the end ,",
    "the expression becomes @xmath41^{\\otimes n } = \\left ( \\hat{\\rho}_1 \\right)^{\\otimes n } .",
    "\\label{rhondef}\\ ] ] so , under these circumstances , the density operator for the general @xmath33-photon mixed state is given by the tensor product of @xmath33 mixed single - photon state density operators .",
    "it is perhaps instructive to check that the trace of this density operator is 1 , which requires that each factor in the tensor product is traced independently .",
    "one can show that , due to the properties of @xmath29 , the trace over products of the single - photon density operator will give zero .",
    "( see [ epsfunk ] . )",
    "one may well ask , why should the @xmath4-parameter for the different single - photon factors in an @xmath33-photon state all be the same , as we tacitly assumed in ( [ mixdefn ] ) ? it could have been expressed more generally as @xmath42 where @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "the resulting density matrix would then be much more complicated , given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a @xmath33-dimensional joint probability density function , such that @xmath47    here one can consider different scenarios . in the first scenario the different @xmath48 s are all statistically independent . in this case",
    ", the @xmath33-dimensional joint probability density function becomes the product of @xmath33 separate one - dimensional probability density functions . as a result ,",
    "the integral breaks up into @xmath33 separate integrals , each representing a two - point correlation function .",
    "however , since each spectrum is only associated with one particular complex conjugate spectrum in this case , the combinatorics will not produce a factor of @xmath39 to cancel the factor of @xmath40 . by implication ,",
    "the result would be suppressed by a factor of @xmath40 .",
    "an alternative scenario , which is actually more natural , is where the different @xmath48 s are perfectly correlated . in this case , the joint probability density function would be zero unless all the @xmath48 s have the same value .",
    "this can be represented as a one - dimensional probability density function , multiplied by dirac delta functions that set all the @xmath48 s equal to each other .",
    "the result is precisely the case that we considered in the previous section with the @xmath49-point function depicted by ( [ npuntdef ] ) .",
    "the reason why this is more natural , is because photons tend to exist in the same state due to their bosonic nature .",
    "this is supported by the enhancement that this scenario receives due to the cancellation of the @xmath40-factor .",
    "we therefore assume that we have the latter scenario .      in terms of general fock states ,",
    "a coherent states can be expressed by @xmath50 again for the mixed case we assume that @xmath51 , leading to @xmath52 in terms of the expression for the coherent states . assuming , as before , that the only nonzero two - point functions are those that contain @xmath38 with its complex conjugate , we then have @xmath53 where @xmath54 is given in ( [ rhondef ] ) .",
    "hence , only the diagonal terms survive .",
    "the complete state then becomes @xmath55    in the end , one can write the density operator as an exponentiated operator . if we substitute ( [ rhondef ] ) into ( [ mixdefa ] ) , we obtain @xmath56^{\\otimes n } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\exp \\left(-|\\alpha|^2\\right ) \\exp_{\\otimes } \\left [ |\\alpha|^2 \\int\\!\\!\\!\\int { \\left|{\\nu}\\right\\rangle } \\epsilon(\\nu-\\nu ' ) s(\\nu ) { \\left\\langle{\\nu'}\\right|}\\ { \\rm d}\\nu\\ { \\rm d}\\nu ' \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\exp \\left(-|\\alpha|^2\\right ) \\exp_{\\otimes } \\left ( |\\alpha|^2 \\hat{\\rho}_1 \\right ) , \\label{kankwa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is defined such that all the operator products in its expansion are tensor products , so these operators do nt operator on each other .",
    "the quantum state of the frequency comb follows from the expression for the density operator in ( [ kankwa ] ) by substituting the expression of the power spectral density of the frequency comb into it .",
    "next , we compute power spectral density of the frequency comb .",
    "to calculate the power spectral density of a frequency comb , we start by considering the mechanism by which the laser light of a frequency comb is generated . for this purpose",
    "we consider the kerr - lens mode - locking process .",
    "the mechanism for the kerr - lens mode - locking is based on the principle that a laser cavity is designed such that loss in the cavity is minimized for high - intensity pulses that produce a kerr - lensing effect .",
    "the different cavity modes add in - phase at a particular point in the cavity and the difference in frequency of different cavity modes is therefore an integer multiple of the pulse repetition frequency @xmath58 .",
    "the latter places some requirements on the dispersion in the cavity , as determined by the wavenumber as a function of frequency @xmath59 . using a taylor series expansion of the wavenumber about the carrier frequency @xmath60",
    ", one can distinguish among the different types of contributions , respectively associated with the phase velocity , the group velocity , the group velocity dispersion , and so forth . to have a constant mode separation , the group velocity dispersion and all higher order terms need to be zero .",
    "for kerr - lens mode - locking , a special subsystem ( using for example , a pair of prisms @xcite ) is used to compensate for the group velocity dispersion .",
    "the effect of the remaining undesired terms could be reduced due to the effect of injection mode locking . here",
    "we ll simply assume that all these undesired terms are zero .",
    "the phase velocity and group velocity determine the mode spacing .",
    "they are also in part responsible for an offset between the lowest harmonic and zero that is not an integer multiple of @xmath58 .",
    "the spectrum that is thus produced can be expressed by @xmath61 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the envelop function representing the shape of the overall spectrum centered around the carrier frequency @xmath60 in both halves of the spectrum , @xmath63 is the carrier - envelop offset - frequency , which represents the offset between the comb frequencies and the harmonic grid frequencies , defined such that @xmath64 .",
    "here we also express the spectrum in terms of a comb - function given by @xmath65 and a convolution process denoted by @xmath66 .",
    "note that @xmath67 is a one - sided spectrum .",
    "the full spectrum is given by @xmath68 .",
    "\\label{volspek}\\ ] ] on both sides , one can let the summation run from @xmath69 to @xmath70 ( to get the comb - function ) , because the additional dirac delta functions will fall outside the region where @xmath71 is nonzero and thus wo nt contribute .",
    "since the time - signal associated with the full spectrum is a real valued function , we have that @xmath72 .    to obtain the time - signal in terms of a pulse train , we can perform an inverse fourier transform on the spectrum . however , here we are only interested in the spectrum .",
    "the power spectral density is the modulus square of the spectrum . for this purpose",
    "we need to add both sides of the spectrum as in ( [ volspek ] ) . however , to compute the power spectral density , we need to treat the dirac delta functions with care .",
    "one can assume that the pulse train is multiplied by an overall envelop function that limits the time duration of the pulse train on the time domain .",
    "this will convolve the comb spectrum with a narrow function @xmath73 , converting the dirac delta functions into narrow spectral component functions .",
    "we also assume that this envelop function and thus also its spectrum @xmath73 are finite energy functions . after taking the modulus square of the spectrum",
    ", one can convert the squares of the narrow functions back into dirac delta functions , with the understanding that one would in the process pick up a factor of an extra dimenson parameter @xmath74 .",
    "this dimension parameter can be absorbed into @xmath62 so that we do nt need to show it explicitly .",
    "the result can be expressed as @xmath75 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{4 } |p(\\nu-\\nu_c)|^2 \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty } \\delta(\\nu - \\nu_{\\rm ceo } - m \\nu_{\\rm rep } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{4 }   |p(\\nu+\\nu_c)|^2 \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty } \\delta(\\nu + \\nu_{\\rm ceo } + m \\nu_{\\rm rep } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{4 } \\left [ { \\cal s}(\\nu ) + { \\cal s}(-\\nu ) \\right ] . \\label{volspek0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the cross terms fall away , because they do nt overlap on the frequency domain .",
    "information about the coherence of a laser source is contained in its power spectral density .",
    "in fact , the inverse fourier transform of the power spectral density is the mutual coherence function .",
    "the coherence of the frequency comb laser light is affected by the statistical properties of the carrier - envelop offset frequency @xmath63 and the pulse - repetition frequency @xmath58 . to take the statistical properties of these quantities into account ,",
    "we need to treat them as random variables and evaluate the power spectral density as an ensemble average .",
    "we ll do this for the positive frequency term @xmath76 where @xmath77 represents the ensemble average . expressing the dirac delta function in terms of its fourier transform",

    "since the random variables only appear in the exponential function under the @xmath79 integral , one can restrict the ensemble averaging to this exponential function . by assuming that the two random variables are statistically independent , we can separate the ensemble average into the product of two ensemble averages @xmath80 \\rangle = \\langle \\exp ( - { { \\rm i}}2\\pi \\xi \\nu_{\\rm ceo } ) \\rangle \\langle \\exp ( - { { \\rm i}}2\\pi \\xi m \\nu_{\\rm rep } ) \\rangle .\\ ] ] we also assume that the random variables are normally distributed , so that one can express their probability density functions by @xmath81 , \\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the mean of the distribution and @xmath83 is its standard deviation . the subscript @xmath84 can either denote ` ceo ' or ` rep ' to represent the carrier - envelop offset frequency or the pulse - repetition frequency , respectively .",
