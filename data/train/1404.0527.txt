    "emission could at the most arise from sources near the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) for a keplerian disk around the smbh .",

    "in addition , we have the condition that the emitting region lie outside the event horizon of the hole given by , @xmath8 conditions ( [ eqn1 ] ) and ( [ eqn2 ] ) can be used together to place lower limits on the emission radius and upper limits on the black hole mass assuming that emission is from an orbital feature ( see fig [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "imprints of the isco would be left on outward bound emission .",
    "a high frequency break in the periodogram observed in black hole x - ray binaries ( eg .",

    "imprints on the emission due to time delay , gravitational and doppler shift , eclipsing and disk structure and intrinsic variability are cast in terms of an effective redshift factor @xmath20 , the ratio of observed to emitted energy of the photon and an integrated flux @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the bolometric emission intensity and @xmath23 is the solid angle of the source subtended at the observer .",
    "these models provide a reasonable match to observations : a high frequency power law region , a low frequency flattening possibly due to decrease in coherency of orbital features and a high frequency cut - off due to the presence of the disk inner edge ( assumed to be at the isco ) beyond which emission ceases as material enters the black hole .",

    "as perturbations produced on the disk can be advected into jets and amplified there by doppler boosting ( e.g. wiita 2006 ) , it is important to study the inner disk and developing jet with foot points on the disk .    here , we present preliminary results based on extensions of the model proposed by pechek et al .",

    "it can address variability induced features in lcs and periodograms and provide conditions for the presence and sustenance of an orbital motion ( source ) based qpo . with a keplerian azimuthal rotational velocity @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the cylindrical distance to the footpoint from which a test particle on the disk begins its motion , the parametrization : @xmath26",

    "camenzind & krockenberger 1992 ) .",
    "detailed future studies ( mohan & mangalam ; in preparation ) will include the treatment of jet launching and a self - consistent treatment of the magnetic field , inclusion of effects due to a spatially distributed source and the calculation of synthetic psds which can be compared with observations to determine limiting time - scales for orbital motion where the timescale @xmath39 hours .",
    "time series analysis of agn lcs using a combination of techniques reveals a wide range of properties such as variability characteristics and its correlation amongst different wavelengths , noise properties and the presence of a qpo and its evolution , thus aiding theoretical models .",
    "these techniques include : the periodogram , lomb - scargle periodogram ( lsp ) , multi - harmonic analysis of variance ( mhaov ) and wavelet analysis .",

    "it has been applied to detect a qpo in the x - ray lc of the blazar 3c 454.3 ( lachowicz et al .",

    "the power peak @xmath49 in all experiments for the mhaov and lsp techniques are consistently equal to or greater than the periodogram based peak .",
    "there is a power loss to other frequencies including harmonics of the primary frequency ( spectral leakage ) due to the finite length of the lc , the convolution of the lc with a rectangular window of duration equal to its length and sampling in the neighbourhood of @xmath19 .",
    "this loss is least in the mhaov technique in a majority of the experiments . a criteria for identifying a true periodicity",

    "the experiments show that the techniques add up in a complementary manner to the finally available information , which can not be obtained using any single technique .",
