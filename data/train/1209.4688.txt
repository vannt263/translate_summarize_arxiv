    "unlike with star formation in the galaxy today , there is little disagreement over the initial conditions of star formation in the primordial universe .",
    "the original numerical simulations suggested that pop iii stars formed in small pregalactic structures known as cosmological minihalos at @xmath0 20 - 30 , or @xmath1 200 myr after the big bang ( bromm , coppi & larson , 1999,2001 ; abel , bryan & norman , 2000 , 2002 ; nakamura & umemura , 2001 ) .",
    "these models predicted that the stars formed in isolation , one per halo , and that they were 100 - 500 m@xmath2 .",
    "pop iii stars profoundly transformed the halos that gave birth to them , expelling their baryons in supersonic ionized flows and later exploding as supernovae ( e.g. whalen , abel & norman , 2004 ; kitayama & yoshida 2005 ; whalen & norman 2008 ; whalen et al .",
    "radiation fronts from these stars also engulfed nearby halos , either promoting or suppressing star formation in them , thereby regulating the rise of the first stellar populations ( shapiro et al .",
    "2004 ; iliev et al . 2005 ; susa & umemura 2006 ; whalen et al . , 2008b,2010 ; hasegawa et al .",
    "2009 ; susa et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the original estimates of pop iii stellar masses were not obtained by modeling the actual formation and evolution of the stars .",
    "they were derived by comparing infall rates at the center of the halo at early stages of collapse to kelvin - helmholz contraction times to place upper limits on the final mass of the star . later",
    "simulation campaigns in the same vein revealed a much broader range of final masses for pop iii stars , 30 - 300 m@xmath2 ( oshea & norman , 2007 ) , and that they could form as binaries in a fraction of the halos ( turk et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "heroic numerical efforts have only recently achieved the formation of a hydrostatic protostar at the center of the halo ( yoshida et al . , 2008 ) and the collapse of the central flow into an accretion disk ( stacy et al . , 2010 ; clark et al . , 2011 ;",
    "smith et al . , 2011 ; greif et al . , 2011,2012 ) .",
    "in particular , the disk calculations indicate that they are unstable to fragmentation , raising the possibility that pop iii stars may have only been tens of solar masses , not hundreds , and that they may have formed in small swarms of up to a dozen at the centers of primeval halos .",
    "computer models of ionizing uv breakout in the final stages of pop iii protostellar disks have also found that the i - front of the nascent star exits the disk in bipolar outflows that terminate accretion onto the star and mostly evaporate the disk by the time the star reaches @xmath1 40 m@xmath2 ( hosokawa et al . , 2011 ) .",
    "this result reinforces the sentiments of some in the community that while the pop iii imf was top - heavy , primordial stars may only have been 10 - 40 m@xmath2 .      in spite of their increasing sophistication ,",
    "these simulations should be taken to be very preliminary for several reasons .",
    "first , pop iii accretion disks form in smoothed - particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) models but not in adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) simulations , although the amr models have not evolved the collapse of the halo to the times achieved by sph calculations .",
    "this raises the question of whether one technique better captures the transport of angular momentum out of the center of the cloud than the other , and whether accretion is ultimately spherical or through a disk .",
    "second , the stability of the disk itself remains an open question because although the simulations can now fully resolve the disk they do not yet incorporate all of its relevant physics .",
    "in particular , they lack high - order radiation transport , which regulates the thermal state of the disk and its tendency to fragment .",
    "furthermore , the role of primordial magnetic fields in the formation and evolution of the disk is not well understood ( turk et al . , 2012 ; widrow et al . ,",
    "2012 ) .    the use of sink particles to represent disk fragments in the original sph simulations of pop iii protostellar disk formation called into question the longevity of the fragments",
    "once they are created in the simulations they are never destroyed , unlike real fragments that could be torn apart by gravitational torques and viscous forces ( norman , 2010 ) .",
    "more recent moving mesh simulations performed with the arepo code that do not rely on sink particles find that the fragments persist but only evolve the disk for 10 - 20 yr ( greif et al . , 2012 ) .",
    "perhaps most importantly , no simulation has followed the disks for more than a few centuries , far short of the time required to assemble a massive star .",
    "thus , it remains unclear if the fragments in the disk remain distinct objects or merge with the largest one at the center , building it up into a very massive star over time through protracted , clumpy accretion .",
    "this latter point directly impacts estimates of final masses for pop iii stars inferred from numerical simulations that attempt to model how ionizing uv from the star reverses infall and evaporates the accretion disk . at the heart of such models",
    "is a simple recipe for the evolution of the protostar that provides a prescription for its radius and luminosity as a function of time and acquired mass .",
    "the hosokawa et al .",
    "( 2011 ) 2d calculations take the growth of the protostar to be relatively steady , in which case it contracts and settles onto the main sequence at @xmath3 m@xmath2 . at this point",
    "the star becomes extremely luminous in ionizing uv radiation that halts accretion onto the star in a few hundred kyr at a final mass of @xmath1 40 m@xmath2 .",
    "if accretion instead turns out to be clumpy , the protostar could remain puffy and cool and reach much larger masses before burning off the disk .",
    "a finer point is that all current accretion cutoff simulations evolve both radiation and hydrodynamics on the courant time , a practice which is known to lead to serious inaccuracies in i - front propagation in density gradients ( whalen & norman , 2006 ) .",
    "such coarse time steps may result in premature i - front breakout and accretion cutoff , and hence underestimates of the final mass of the star .",
    "three dimensional simulations with more accurate radiation  matter coupling schemes , both steady and clumpy accretion scenarios , more realistic prescriptions for protostellar evolution based on nucleosynthesis codes such as kepler ( weaver et al . , 1978 ; woosley et al . , 2002 ) and a variety of halo environments may better constrain the pop iii imf . however , in judging the power of such simulations to model the masses of the first stars , it should be remembered that no simulations realistically bridge the gap in time between the formation and fragmentation of a protostellar disk and its photoevaporation up to a myr later .",
    "we note in passing that fragments can also stop accreting if they are ejected from the disk by 3-body gravitational effects ( greif et al . , 2011 ;",
    "johnson & khochfar , 2011 ) .",
    "these fragments could become very low - mass pop iii stars ( @xmath1 1 m@xmath4 ) ; if so , some of them may live today .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     detection of pop iii sne would unambiguously probe the masses of primordial stars for the first time .",
    "since these explosions are 100,000 times brighter than either their progenitors or the primitive galaxies that host them , they could be found by jwst or the wide - field infrared survey telescope ( wfirst ) .",
    "however , unlike the type ia sne used to constrain cosmic acceleration , light from primeval supernovae must traverse the vast cosmic web of neutral hydrogen that filled the universe prior to the epoch of reionization .",
    "lyman absorption by this hydrogen removes or scatters most of the light from ancient supernovae out of our line of sight , obscuring them .",
    "whalen et al .",
    "( 2012a , b , c ) have calculated jwst nir light curves for pop iii pair - instability sne with the los alamos rage and spectrum codes ( gittings et al . , 2008 ; frey et al . , 2012 ) , which are shown for @xmath5 10 , 15 , 20 and 30 in figure [ fig : jwst_lc ] .",
    "these simulations include radiation hydrodynamical calculations of the sn light curve and spectra in the local frame , cosmological redshifting , and lyman absorption by intergalactic hydrogen .",
    "jwst detection limits at 2 - 4 @xmath6 m are ab magnitude 31 - 32 , so it is clear that jwst will be able to detect the first cosmic explosions in the universe if they are pi sne ( and even perform spectrometry on them ) . even given jwst s very narrow fields of view at high redshifts , recent calculations indicate that at least a few pi sne should be present in any given jwst survey ( hummel et al .",
    "2012 ) . also , because wfirst detection limits will be ab magnitude 26.5 at 2.2 @xmath6 m",
    ", it is clear from figure [ fig : jwst_lc ] that pop iii pi sne will be visible to wfirst out to @xmath0 15 - 20 . since it is an all - sky survey , and because this redshift range may favor the formation of very massive pop iii stars because of the rise of lyman - werner uv backgrounds ( oshea & norman , 2008 ) , wfirst will detect much larger numbers of pop iii sne .",
    "could pop iii sne be detected at later stages by other means ?",
    "whalen et al . , ( 2008b ) found that most of the energy of pop iii cc sne is eventually radiated away as h and he lines as the remnant sweeps up and shocks surrounding gas . at",
    "later epochs this energy would instead be lost to fine structure cooling by metals . in both cases",
    "the emission is too dim , redshifted and drawn out over time to be detected by any upcoming instruments .",
    "however , pi sne deposit up to half of their energy into the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by inverse compton scattering at @xmath0 20 ( kitayama & yoshida , 2005 ; whalen et al . , 2008b ) and could impose excess power on the cmb at small scales ( oh , cooray & kamionkowski , 2003 ) . the resolution of current ground - based cmb telescopes such as the _ atacama cosmology telescope _ and _ south pole telescope",
    "_ approaches that required to directly image sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) fluctuations from individual pop iii pi sn remnants , so future observatories may detect them . unlike pi sne ,",
    "cc sne deposit little of their energy into the cmb at @xmath0 20 , and even less at lower redshifts because the density of cmb photons falls with cosmological expansion .",
    "the extreme nir luminosities of primordial pi sne could contribute to a nir background excess , as has been suggested for pop iii stars themselves , i.e. kashlinsky ( 2005 ) .",
    "new calculations reveal that enough synchrotron emission from cc sn remnants is redshifted into the 21 cm band above @xmath0 10 to be directly detected by the _ square kilometer array _ ( _ ska _ ) ( meiksen & whalen 2012 ) .",
    "somewhat more energetic hypernovae could be detected by existing facilities such as the _ extended very - large array _",
    "( _ evla _ ) and _ emerlin_. pi sn remnants generally expand into ambient media that are too diffuse to generate a detectable synchrotron signal .",
    "pop iii sn event rates make it unlikely that they will be found in absorption at 21 cm at @xmath7 10",
    ".    the detection of the first cosmic explosions will be one of the most spectacular discoveries in extragalactic astronomy in the coming decade , opening our first observational window on the era of first light and the end of the cosmic dark ages at @xmath0 30 .",
    "they will unveil the nature of primordial stars and constrain scenarios for early cosmological reionization , the process whereby the universe was gradually transformed from a cold , dark , featureless void into the vast , hot , ionized expanse of galaxies we observe today . at somewhat lower redshifts ( @xmath0 10 - 15 ) , detections of pop iii supernovae will probe the era of primitive galaxy formation , marking the positions of nascent galaxies on the sky that might otherwise have eluded detection by jwst .",
    "finally , finding the first supernovae could also reveal the masses of the seeds of the supermassive black holes lurking at the centers of massive galaxies today .",

    "all numerical simulations were performed on institutional computing ( ic ) and yellow network platforms at lanl ( conejo , lobo and yellowrail ) .",
    "* daniel whalen : * this is an excellent question .",
    "we recently published a letter ( whalen & fryer 2012 ) in which we found that most 20 - 40 m@xmath2 pop iii black holes would be ejected from the cosmological halos that gave birth to them at velocities of 500 - 1000 km s@xmath9 by natal kicks due to asymmetries in the core - collapse engine .",
    "such velocities are far above the escape velocity of any halo they would encounter for over a hubble time , so there is a good chance that these black holes would be exiled to the voids between galaxies today .",
    "black holes above 40 m@xmath4 are unlikely to be born with kicks and remain in the halo , accreting and growing over cosmic time .",
    "these black holes are much more likely to reside in the galaxies into which their host halos were taken , a few of which could become the supermassive black holes found in the sdss quasars today .      *",
    "daniel whalen : * it is currently thought that the minimum halo mass for forming a pop iii star is @xmath1",
    "10@xmath10 m@xmath2 and that 1 - 10 stars are formed with masses of 30 - 300 m@xmath11 .",
    "thus , a conservative estimate is that 0.1 - 1% of the baryons in the halo are converted into stars , and that the rest are evicted from the halo by strong ionized flows over the life of the stars ."
