    "the current experimental data on neutrino mass differences and neutrino mixing angles clearly indicate new physics beyond the so far successful standard model of particle physics ( sm ) .",
    "in particular , neutrino oscillations imply that at least two generations of neutrinos must be massive .",
    "therefore , one needs to extend the sm to incorporate neutrino mass terms .",
    "we assume here the simplest version of a susy extension of the sm , the well known minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , extended by right - handed majorana neutrinos and their susy partners , and where the seesaw mechanism of type i  @xcite is implemented to generate the small neutrino masses . for simplicity , we focus here in the one generation case which already provides interesting results and allows for a clearer illustration of the most relevant behaviour of the radiative corrections with the majorana mass scale .",
    "the three generation case will be postponed for a later work .    on the other hand , it is well known that heavy majorana neutrinos , with @xmath7 gev , induce large lfv rates  @xcite , due to their potentially large yukawa couplings to the higgs sector .",
    "for the same reason , radiative corrections to higgs boson masses due to such heavy majorana neutrinos could also be relevant .",
    "consequently , our study has been focused on the radiative corrections to the lightest mssm cp - even @xmath8 boson mass , @xmath9 , due to the one - loop contributions from the neutrino / sneutrino sector within the mssm - seesaw framework .    in the following we briefly review the main relevant aspects of the calculation of the mass corrections and the numerical results . for further details",
    "we address the reader to the full version of our work  @xcite , where also an extensive list with references to related works can be found .",
    "the mssm - seesaw model with one neutrino / sneutrino generation is described in terms of the well known mssm superpotential plus the new relevant terms contained in : @xmath10\\,+\\ , { \\frac{1}{2}}\\,\\hat n \\,{m_m}\\,\\hat n \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the majorana mass and @xmath12 is the additional superfield that contains the right - handed neutrino @xmath13 and its scalar partner @xmath14 .",
    "there are also new relevant terms in the soft susy breaking potential : @xmath15    after electro - weak ( ew ) symmetry breaking , the charged lepton and dirac neutrino masses can be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 are the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the neutral higgs scalars , with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath20 neutrino mass matrix is given in terms of @xmath21 and @xmath11 by : @xmath22 diagonalization of @xmath23 leads to two mass eigenstates , @xmath24 , which are majorana fermions with the respective mass eigenvalues given by : @xmath25 the mixing angle that defines the mass eigenstates is given by , @xmath26 in the seesaw limit , i.e. when @xmath27 : @xmath28 and @xmath29 is small , therefore , @xmath30 is made predominantly of @xmath31 and its c - conjugate , @xmath32 , whereas @xmath33 is made predominantly of @xmath34 and its c - conjugate , @xmath35 .",
    "regarding the sneutrino sector , the sneutrino mass matrices for the cp - even , @xmath36 , and the cp - odd , @xmath37 , subsectors are given respectively by @xmath38 the diagonalization of these two matrices , @xmath39 , leads to four sneutrino mass eigenstates , @xmath40 . in the seesaw limit , where @xmath11 is much bigger than all the other mass scales",
    "the corresponding sneutrino masses are given by : @xmath41 the mixing angles defining the sneutrinos mass eigenstates , @xmath42 , are small in this limit and , therefore , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are made predominantly of @xmath45 and its c - conjugate , @xmath46 , whereas @xmath47 and @xmath48 are made predominantly of @xmath49 and its c - conjugate , @xmath50 .",
    "regarding the relevant interactions for the present work , there are pure gauge interactions between the left - handed neutrinos and the @xmath51  boson , those between the left - handed sneutrinos and the higgs bosons , and those between the left - handed sneutrinos and the @xmath51  bosons .",
    "all of these are common to the mssm .",
    "in addition , in this mssm - seesaw scenario , there are interactions driven by the neutrino yukawa couplings ( or equivalently @xmath21 since @xmath52 ) , as for instance @xmath53 , and new interactions due to the majorana nature driven by @xmath11 which are not present in the case of dirac fermions , as for instance @xmath54 .    finally , concerning the size of the new parameters that have been introduced in this model , in addition to those of the mssm , i.e. , @xmath11 , @xmath21 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , there are no significant constraints . in the literature",
    "it is often assumed that @xmath11 has a very large value , @xmath58 , in order to get small physical neutrino masses @xmath59 0.1 - 1 ev with large yukawa couplings @xmath60 .",
    "this is an interesting possibility since it can lead to important phenomenological implications due to the large size of the radiative corrections driven by these large yukawa couplings .",
    "we have explored , however , not only these extreme values but the full range for @xmath11 from the electroweak scale @xmath61 up to @xmath62 .",
    "in the feynman diagrammatic ( fd ) approach the higher - order corrected cp - even higgs boson masses in the mssm , denoted here as @xmath9 and @xmath63 , are derived by finding the poles of the @xmath64-propagator matrix , which is equivalent to solving the following equation @xcite : @xmath65 \\left[p^2 - m_{h}^2 + \\hsi_{hh}(p^2 ) \\right ] - \\left[\\hsi_{hh}(p^2)\\right]^2 = 0\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : proppole}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 are the tree level masses .",
    "the one loop renormalized self - energies , @xmath67 , in can be expressed in terms of the bare self - energies , @xmath68 , the field renormalization constants @xmath69 and the mass counter terms @xmath70 , where @xmath71 stands for @xmath72 .",
    "for example , the lightest higgs boson renormalized self energy reads :    @xmath73    regarding the renormalization prescription , we have used an on - shell renormalization scheme for @xmath74 and @xmath75 mass counterterms and @xmath76 tadpole counterterms . on the other hand , we have used a modified @xmath77 scheme @xmath78 for the renormalization of the wave function and @xmath79 .",
    "the m@xmath77 scheme is very similar to the well known @xmath77 scheme but instead of subtracting the usual @xmath80 one subtracts @xmath81 , hence , avoiding large logarithms of the large scale @xmath82 . as studied in other works  @xcite , this scheme minimizes higher order corrections when two very different scales are involved in a calculation of radiative corrections .",
    "since we are interested in exploring the relevance of the new radiative corrections to the lightest higgs mass from the neutrino / sneutrino sector , we will present here our results in terms of the mass difference with respect to the mssm prediction .",
    "consequently , we define , @xmath83 where @xmath84 denotes the pole for the light higgs mass including the @xmath85 corrections ( i.e.  in the mssm - seesaw model ) , and @xmath9 the corresponding pole in the mssm , i.e without the @xmath85 corrections . thus , for a given set of input parameters we first calculate @xmath9 in the mssm with the help of feynhiggs  @xcite , such that all relevant known higher - order corrections are included , and then we compute @xmath86 .",
    "the full one - loop neutrino / sneutrino corrections to the self - energies , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , entering in the evaluation of @xmath86 have been evaluated with the help of _ feynarts _  @xcite and _ formcalc _  @xcite .",
    "we have fully explored the dependence with all the new parameters in  @xcite and found that the radiative corrections to the higgs mass are mostly sensitive to @xmath11 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath55 .",
    "we focus here on @xmath11 , @xmath90 and @xmath55 leading to the largest corrections and address the reader to  @xcite for the complete study in terms of all the parameters .    first , in order to compare systematically our predictions of the neutrino / sneutrino sector in the mssm - seesaw with those in the mssm , we have split the full one - loop neutrino / sneutrino result into two parts : @xmath92 where @xmath93 means the contributions from pure gauge interactions and they are obtained by switching off the yukawa interactions , i.e.  by setting @xmath94 ( or equivalently @xmath95 ) .",
    "the remaining part is named here @xmath96 and refers to the contributions that are only present if @xmath97 . in other words ,",
    "this separation splits the full result into the common part with the mssm , given by @xmath93 , and the new contributions due to the presence of majorana neutrinos with non vanishing yukawa interactions , given by @xmath96 .",
    "thus , by comparing the size of these two parts , within the allowed parameter space region , we will localize the areas where @xmath98 , which will therefore indicate a significant departure from the mssm result .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : renseversusmm ] that the yukawa part clearly dominates for large @xmath99 gev and that it shows a relevant external momentum dependence .",
    "therefore , at large @xmath11 , to keep just the yukawa part is a good approximation , but to neglect the momentum dependence or to set the external momentum to zero are certainly not . in consequence ,",
    "the alternative effective potential method will not provide a realistic result for the radiative corrections to the higgs mass .",
    "second , in order to understand in simple terms the analytical behavior of our full numerical results we have expanded the renormalized self - energies in powers of the seesaw parameter @xmath100 : @xmath101 the zeroth order of this expansion corresponds to the gauge contribution and it does not depend on @xmath21 or @xmath11 .",
    "the rest of the expansion corresponds to the yukawa contribution .",
    "the leading term of this yukawa contribution is the @xmath102 term , because it is the only one not suppressed by the majorana scale .",
    "in fact it goes as @xmath103 , where @xmath104 denotes generically the electroweak scales involved , concretely , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 . in particular , the @xmath108 terms of the renormalized self - energy , which turn out to be among the most relevant leading contributions , separated into the neutrino and sneutrino contributions , are the following : @xmath109{$h$ } \\dashline(55,25)(70,25){3 } \\text(72,25)[l]{$h$ } \\arrowarc(40,25)(15,0,180 ) \\text(40,46)[b]{$\\nu_l$ } \\arrowarc(40,25)(15,-180,0 ) \\text(40,4)[t]{$\\nu_r$ } \\end{picture }   \\end{array } } + { \\begin{array}{c } \\begin{picture}(80,50 ) \\dashline(10,25)(25,25){3 } \\text(8,25)[r]{$h$ } \\dashline(55,25)(70,25){3 } \\text(72,25)[l]{$h$ } \\dasharrowarc(40,25)(15,0,180){3 } \\text(40,46)[b]{${\\tilde \\nu}_l$ } \\dasharrowarc(40,25)(15,-180,0){3 } \\text(40,4)[t]{${\\tilde \\nu}_r$ } \\end{picture }   \\end{array } } \\right|_{{m_d}^2 p^2}\\ ] ] @xmath110 notice that the above neutrino contributions come from the yukawa interaction @xmath111 , which is extremely suppressed in the dirac case but can be large in the present majorana case . on the other hand ,",
    "the above sneutrino contributions come from the new couplings @xmath112 , which are not present in the dirac case .",
    "it is also interesting to remark that these terms , being @xmath113 are absent in both the effective potential and the rge approaches .",
    "an useful formula for the higgs mass correction has then be derived , by keeping just the dominant @xmath102 contribution to the yukawa part of the renormalized self - energy : @xmath114}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have checked that this simple expression reproduces very accurately the full numerical result , for the region of our interest with large @xmath115 gev",
    ".    with respect to the numerical results , figure [ masscontours1 ] exemplifies the main features of the extra higgs mass corrections @xmath86 due to neutrinos and sneutrino loops in terms of the two physical majorana neutrino masses , @xmath116 and @xmath117 . for values of @xmath118 gev and @xmath119",
    "ev the corrections to @xmath120 are positive and smaller than 0.1 gev . in this region ,",
    "the gauge contribution dominates . in fact",
    ", the wider black contour line with fixed @xmath121 coincides with the prediction for the case where just the gauge part in the self - energies has been included .",
    "this means that the distance of any other contour - line with respect to this one represents the difference in the radiative corrections respect to the mssm prediction .    however , for larger values of @xmath116 and/or @xmath122 the yukawa part dominates , and the radiative corrections become negative and larger in absolute value , up to values of -5 gev in the right upper corner of fig .",
    "[ masscontours1 ] .",
    "these corrections grow in modulus proportionally to @xmath11 and @xmath117 , due to the fact that the seesaw mechanism imposes a relation between the three masses involved , @xmath123 .    c    finally , we plot in fig .",

    "@xmath11 is fixed here to the reference value , @xmath125 gev . for the interval studied here , we see again that the radiative corrections can be negative and as large as tens of gev in the upper right corner of the plot . for instance , @xmath126 for @xmath125 gev , @xmath127 ev and @xmath128 .",
    "we have used the feynman diagrammatic approach for the calculation of the radiative corrections to the lightest higgs boson mass of the mssm - seesaw .",
    "this method does not neglect the external momentum of the incoming and outgoing particles as it happens in the effective potential approach .",
    "we have performed a full calculation , obtaining not only the leading logarithmic terms as it would be the case in a rge computation but also the finite terms , that we have seen that can be sizable for heavy majorana neutrinos ( @xmath129 ) and the lightest neutrino mass within a range inspired by data ( @xmath130  ev ) .",
    "for some regions of the mssm - seesaw parameter space , the corrections to @xmath9 are substantially larger than the anticipated lhc precision ( @xmath131 )  @xcite . specifically they can be negative and up to -5 gev if @xmath132 gev and @xmath133 ev and up to minus tens of gev if in addition @xmath55 is also large and of similar size to @xmath11 .",
