    "the discovery of superconductivity in iron - based pnictides @xcite sparked a tremendous surge of interest and research activities .",
    "this class of materials displays a high structural and chemical flexibility comprising several closely related structure types based on common layered fe - pnictogen building blocks . depending on charge - carrier doping , external or chemical pressure",
    "they all show a subtle interplay among structural transitions , antiferromagnetism ( afm ) and superconductivity @xcite . the relevance of magnetic fluctuations for the stabilization of the superconducting state has been put forward for unconventional superconductors which are found among a wide range of compound families @xcite . their role in superconducting iron - pnictides",
    "are now subjected to intense scrutiny . in this context , the compound eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( with the body centered tetragonal thcr@xmath0si@xmath0- type of structure , where layers of fe@xmath0as@xmath0 alternate with eu layers along the c - axis ) was presented as an important model system to study the interplay between well defined 4@xmath2 magnetic states and the electronic properties of the iron - arsenide layer @xcite .",
    "eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 is an intermetallic compound which undergoes both a spin density wave ( sdw ) type antiferromagnetic phase transition at @xmath7 k , associated with the itinerant states of the feas subsystem , and a localized afm ordering taking place at @xmath8 k , associated with the eu 4@xmath2 local moments subsystem @xcite .",
    "the magnetic structure of the local moment subsystem consists of eu@xmath1 layers in a ferromagnetic order , stacked antiferromagnetically along the @xmath9-axis @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that upon substitution on any of the eu ( k substitution ) @xcite , fe ( co substitution ) @xcite and as ( p substitution ) sites @xcite , the itinerant afm state is suppressed and the onset of a superconducting phase is observed .",
    "similar behavior is also found when the host compound is subjected to external pressure , that is also claimed to lead to the appearance of reentrant superconductivity @xcite .    notwithstanding",
    "the large effects observed in the itinerant afm phase , the energy scale of the local moment interaction , as compared to the energy scale of the itinerant subsystem , has been observed to be only slightly modified in all of these substitutional studies .",
    "this suggests a weak coupling between the local 4@xmath2 electronic states and the electronic and magnetic properties of the feas layers .",
    "further indication in this direction is also drawn from the study of the rather weak suppression of the superconducting state by the inclusion of eu in optimally doped sr@xmath10eu@xmath11fe@xmath3co@xmath4as@xmath0 @xcite , from the lack of signatures on the electronic structure of eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 when the eu@xmath1 subsystem undergoes the afm transition @xcite and from magnetotransport studies @xcite .",
    "the nature of the local moment ordering , however , is changed from afm to ferromagnetic ( fm ) upon substitution of as by p @xcite and possibly also for fe by co @xcite . in the case of p substitution",
    ", it seems clear that the change from afm to fm order is related to both structural effects and substitutional effects @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the co substitution , where the change in the electron filling is supposed to be the dominant effect , allowing a more controlled investigation .    in searching a comprehensive description of the magnetic and electronic properties of the feas layers ,",
    "the electron spin resonance of eu@xmath1 has proven to be a suitable tool to provide information on the spin dynamics in eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "a proper understanding of the eu@xmath1 spin relaxation is essential , and especially needs to be considered for _ concentrated _ eu@xmath1 ions like in eufe@xmath3co@xmath4as@xmath0 . in case of eu@xmath1 ions",
    "_ diluted _ in a metallic environment , the spin relaxation is determined by the exchange scattering between the local and itinerant spins ( the korringa process ) and should be sensitive to the spin dynamics of both @xcite . however , in concentrated magnetic compounds , the electronic spin relaxation is expected to be determined more by the exchange coupling among the local spins @xcite which is sensitive to an externally applied magnetic field .",
    "therefore , a systematic investigation of the field dependence of the esr in eufe@xmath3co@xmath4as@xmath0 and an interpretation in terms of concentrated eu@xmath1 ions provide a unique tool to evaluate the relation between the local moment magnetism and the magnetic and electronic properties of the itinerant subsystem .    to this aim , along with dc - susceptibility measurements , we present the eu@xmath1 esr at three different magnetic fields , corresponding to resonance frequencies of @xmath12 ghz ( @xmath13-band ) , @xmath14 ghz ( @xmath15-band ) and @xmath16 ghz ( @xmath17-band )",
    ". we shall discuss a significant reinterpretation of the available esr data @xcite , that do not include an investigation on the field dependence of the relaxation .",
    "the field dependence of the relaxation is a strong piece of evidence that the eu 4@xmath2 local moments are coupled with the fe@xmath3co@xmath4as@xmath6 itinerant magnetic fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , we have also perfomed band structure calculations to guide our discussion on the nature of the eu@xmath1 spin relaxation .",
    "the local moment relaxation is sensitive to the exchange coupling between the local spins by virtue of the so - called bottleneck effect @xcite .",
    "it occurs when the conduction electron - lattice scattering rate ( @xmath18 ) is smaller than , or comparable to , the conduction electron - magnetic ion ( @xmath19 ) scattering rate .",
    "in this situation , after being scattered by the magnetic center ( the korringa process ) , the conduction electrons , instead of dissipating energy to the lattice , give this energy back to the magnetic ion system ( overhauser process ) .",
    "as a consequence , one may probe a suppressed korringa process @xcite , since the slow @xmath18 will modulate the korringa rate .",
    "however , it may also occur that the relaxation simply does not reflect the exchange scattering between the local moments and the conduction electrons , being determined primarily by the exchange coupling between the eu@xmath1 ions @xcite .    even in the latter scenario",
    "the properties of the fe@xmath3co@xmath4as@xmath6 itinerant subsystem can be deduced from the local moment relaxation , since the coupling among local spins is realized through the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) indirect exchange interaction .",
    "hence , while mediating the exchange coupling of the local subsystem , the itinerant subsystem manifest its properties in the local moment relaxation .",
    "this interplay qualifies the eu@xmath1 esr as a suitable probe for the spin dynamics taking place in the fe@xmath3co@xmath4as@xmath6 layers .",

    "in particular , this kind of relaxation mechanism is suggested by the opposing evolutions of the linewidth slope ( @xmath73 ) and the calculated dos at the fermi level along the series .",
    "the clear field dependence of the relaxation indicates the presence of magnetic fluctuations and provides a picture of how the relative strength of the itinerant magnetic fluctuations evolves along the series .",
    "interestingly , this field dependence is well pronounced for @xmath44 where the afm order of the itinerant subsystem is suppressed , indicating it is a property of the emerging itinerant magnetic fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , the field effect is visible even at @xmath113 which is far away from @xmath114 .",
    "the esr results add further evidence that the presence of the eu@xmath1 spins nearly does not affect the electronic or magnetic properties of the itinerant subsystem .",
    "therefore , one could expect that our picture on the evolution of the magnetic fluctuations is a general property of the fe@xmath3co@xmath4as@xmath6 layers .",
    "we are in great debt to deepa kasinathan for many discussions on the properties of the eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 system .",
