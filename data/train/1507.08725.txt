    "there are a number of strongly correlated materials that have charge - density - wave ( cdw ) behavior .",
    "static order occurs in the transition metal di- and trichalchogenides , which display either quasi one dimensional ( nbse@xmath0 ) or quasi two dimensional ( tase@xmath1 or tbte@xmath0 ) order  @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional charge - density - wave order is observed in ba@xmath2k@xmath3bio@xmath0 compounds  @xcite .",
    "there is a longstanding question concerning the nature of the cdw order , namely , whether the order is driven electronically , with a lattice instability following the electronic instability , or _ vice versa_. indeed , in real materials the charge and lattice degrees of freedom are usually strongly coupled , but recent time - resolved core - level photoemission spectroscopy experiments  @xcite for some cdw materials indicate an electronically driven nature to ordering .",
    "this makes it reasonable to study the cdw phase for strongly correlated electronic systems that do not include a coupling to the lattice .",
    "while most theoretical interests in strongly correlated systems have been concentrated on equilibrium behavior , recent experiments on pump - probe spectroscopy  @xcite have caused an increase of attention to nonequilibrium dynamics .",
    "these experiments display a nonequilibrium melting of the cdw state , which is manifested by a filling of the gap in the photoemission spectrum , while the order parameter remains nonzero .",
    "this phenomenon has been examined with an exactly solvable model  @xcite for a system starting at zero temperature .",
    "we use the falicov - kimball model in our analysis because it is one of the simplest models  @xcite which possesses static charge - density - wave ordering and has an exact solution within dmft  @xcite ( for a review see ref .",
    "the many - body formalism for nonequilibrium dynamical mean - field theory is straightforward to develop within the kadanoff - baym - keldysh formalism  @xcite . since the many - body perturbation theory diagrams are topologically identical for both equilibrium and nonequilibrium perturbation theories  @xcite , the perturbative analysis of metzner  @xcite guarantees that the nonequilibrium self - energy remains local .",
    "the basic structure of the iterative approach to solving the dmft equations  @xcite continues to hold .",
    "detailed development of the nonequilibrium dmft approach has been done for the case of the uniform phase of the falicov - kimball model  @xcite . here",
    "we generalize this method to the case of the cdw ordered phase .",
    "in order to describe the cdw ordered state , one has to rewrite the hamiltonian assuming the existence of the charge modulation .",
    "this can be done in two ways : by introducing two sublattices `` @xmath4 '' and `` @xmath5 '' in real space or by the nesting of the brillouin zone ( bz ) at the modulation vector @xmath6 in a reciprocal space .",
    "the modulation vector @xmath7 defines the sublattices by @xmath8 in the ordered phase , due to nesting of the fermi surface , the bz is reduced and instead of the annihilation ( creation ) operators with momentum @xmath9 defined in the initial bz by @xmath10 , one has to introduce two fermionic operators in momentum space in the reduced zone ( @xmath11 ) as @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "now , one can write down the relations between annihilation ( creation ) operators defined on the sublattices ( @xmath14 ) and in the rbz ( @xmath15 ) @xmath16 or in a matrix form as follows : @xmath17",
    "we use both sublattice ( @xmath14 ) and rbz ( @xmath15 ) bases . any two - operator - product - type quantity , _",
    "e.g. _ the one - particle green s function , can be defined with the additional sublattice indices @xmath18 @xmath19 , or with the rbz indices @xmath20 @xmath21 , and these representations are connected by the aforementioned unitary transformation @xmath22 we work in units where @xmath23 .",
    "the time - dependent hamiltonian of the spinless falicov - kimball model on a bipartite lattice has the form @xmath24 we consider the case when charged fermions interact with an external electric field which is spatially uniform .",
    "this allows us to describe the electric field via a time - dependent vector potential in the coulomb gauge as @xmath25 .",
    "interaction with this external field results in a peierls substitution to the kinetic term of the hamiltonian .    in the sublattice representation",
    "( @xmath14 ) , the local part of the hamiltonian is diagonal and the non - local kinetic one is off - diagonal in the case of the nearest - neighbor hopping . in the rbz representation ( @xmath15 )",
    "vice versa_.    the fourier transformation to momentum space gives the time - dependent kinetic term in the form @xmath26 where an extended band energy @xmath27@xcite in matrix form in the ( @xmath14 ) basis becomes @xmath28   \\scriptstyle \\epsilon(\\mathbf k)\\cos ( a(t))+\\bar{\\epsilon}(\\mathbf k)\\sin ( a(t ) ) & \\scriptstyle 0   \\end{vmatrix}.   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the rbz representation ( @xmath15 ) , an extended band energy matrix is diagonal . here",
    ", we introduced the band energies @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and we set @xmath31 as our energy unit .",
    "the key object of our interest is the time - dependent green s function that is defined on the keldysh - schwinger contour@xcite @xmath32 we start from a formal solution of dyson s equation for the lattice green s function : @xmath33}^{-1}(t , t').\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the two - sublattice representation ( @xmath14 ) , the self - energy @xmath34 is diagonal and the noninteracting green s function @xmath35 is non - diagonal [ because of extended band energy @xmath27 in eq .",

    "we discretize the contour with several different grids and then find the continuous matrix limit using lagrange s interpolation formula . to find the inverse matrix in eq .",
    "( [ mglat ] ) , where its components are matrices in time variables , we need to apply the block matrix pseudo - inverse formula .",
    "we have performed a transition onto the bz basis in order to find the lattice green s function in terms of the noninteracting green s function .",
    "further , we construct the other dmft equations to make the system of equations self - consistent . in our case of a cdw phase ,",
    "it is more convenient and clear how to do this in the sublattice basis ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "hence , at this point we apply an inverse transformation from eq .",
    "( [ transformation ] ) onto the sublattice basis and write down expressions for the components of the lattice green s function in the @xmath37 basis in terms of its components in the rbz basis .",
    "the next step in the dmft approach is to find the local green s function , which is further mapped onto a single impurity problem .",
    "since we are considering a two - sublattice system , we have two local green s functions for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 sublattices , respectively .",
    "to calculate the local green s functions , we need to sum over the reduced bz all @xmath38-dependent functions .",
    "because of presence of the time - dependent vector potential , one has to replace the summation over the bz by a double integration over the energies @xmath39 with a joint density of states which is a gaussian in each variable for the hypercubic lattice @xcite and is given by @xmath40 .",

    "the total concentration of localized electrons is fixed , and @xmath58 is defined from the initial equilibrium condition . in nonequilibrium , the order parameter remains the same as in equilibrium because the @xmath59-particles of the falicov - kimball model do not interact with the external field .",
    "we calculate the current in the hamiltonian gauge by evaluating the operator average @xmath61 where the lesser green s function @xmath62 is extracted from contour ordered green s function , and the velocity component is @xmath63 .",
    "the results of the numerical calculation depend strongly on the discretization of the time interval and we need to take the limit of @xmath64 . smaller @xmath44 results in larger matrices",
    "so we exploit an extrapolation procedure to get more accurate results . in fig .",
    "[ current ] , we present the results for the current at @xmath53 that corresponds to a metallic phase at temperature @xmath42 and order parameter @xmath43 .",
    "different curves correspond to different values of @xmath44 and we use a quadratic lagrange s interpolation formula to extrapolate the result to @xmath65 .",
    "these show the correct zero current before the field is turned on at @xmath66 ( we choose @xmath41 ) and their longer time behavior agrees with zero temperature calculations for the falicov - kimball model as well@xcite . similarly , in fig .",
    "[ conc ] , we show the results for concentration of @xmath67-electrons on the @xmath4-sublattice . here",
    ", extrapolation shows an even more significant shift of the nonzero @xmath44 results and its result is in a good agreement with the @xmath68 calculations@xcite .",
