    ". in particular , an anisotropic thermal conductivity , comparable in magnitude to that of metallic systems , was observed in quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) spin-@xmath8 chain and ladder compounds with a large part of the heat current attributed to magnetic excitations.@xcite in the quasi-2d and some quasi-1d materials various other effects were observed including strong increase of the thermal conductivity by a modest magnetic field@xcite and enhanced scattering due to suppression of the gap in the spin - gaped materials.@xcite the thermal transport anomalies in layered cuprates associated with the magnetic and/or stripe excitations have also been found.@xcite    both the strength and the temperature range for these new effects are very different from their counterparts in 3d magnetic materials , where the heat transport by well - defined magnetic excitations exist only well below the corresponding 3d ordering transition temperature.@xcite note that the thermal transport in low - dimensional magnets has been studied before@xcite and the qualitative reasons for that difference has been understood . in 2d systems",
    "magnetic excitations can be very well defined in a paramagnetic phase because of the large in - plane magnetic correlation length@xcite and in 1d systems the soliton - like excitations can exist without any long - range order.@xcite    _ theories .",
    "_  however , only recently a considerable progress in the theoretical understanding of the transport properties of 1d quantum spin systems has been made.@xcite the main focus of these recent studies has been on the relationship of the spin transport and conservation laws,@xcite specifically on the possibility of an ideal conducting state in one - dimensional integrable and non - integrable systems.@xcite while this problem is of significant interest , the importance of the spin - phonon and spin - impurity couplings , which break down the integrability of the underlying spin - only models , has also been discussed.@xcite in particular , it was obtained within the memory matrix formalism that the interplay of umklapp scattering and spin - phonon coupling leads to the exponential temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity @xmath9 , with @xmath10 proportional to the phonon s debye energy @xmath3.@xcite    _ boltzmann equation approach . _  in the present work@xcite we consider the problem of anomalous heat transport in quasi-1d spin - chain systems under a somewhat different prospective .",
    "first , we derive microscopically a model of 1d spin - boson excitations interacting with the 3d phonon environment and impurities , where the spin - boson representation of the 1d heisenberg model is obtained by performing the standard jordan - wigner transformation followed by bosonization.@xcite it is assumed that the spin - boson velocity is large in comparison with the phonon velocity , @xmath11 .",
    "the limit @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) corresponds to the experimental situation in sr@xmath0cuo@xmath1 , srcuo@xmath0 , ( la , ca , sr)@xmath14cu@xmath15o@xmath16 , and other cuprate materials@xcite where @xmath17k and @xmath18 . this large difference in spin and phonon energy scales is also responsible for the fact that , experimentally , the `` spin peak '' in thermal conductivity occurs at the temperatures well above the `` phonon peak''.@xcite with this assumption and in the limit of weak spin - lattice coupling we solve the boltzmann equation for the spin - boson distribution function and find the spin - phonon relaxation time @xmath19 .    _",
    "normal vs umklapp .",
    "_  why @xmath19 is important ?",
    "generally , the relaxation of the heat current and the resulting finite thermal conductivity should be due to the umklapp processes or any other processes which do not conserve momentum . since the characteristic `` bandwidth '' for the spin excitations in the real 1d spin chains materials of interest is very large ( @xmath17k ) in comparison with the experimental temperature range , the umklapp scattering of spin excitations on themselves is strongly suppressed ( as @xmath20 ) .",
    "instead , by considering the limit @xmath21 , we propose that the leading relaxation mechanism at not too low temperatures is the two - stage , bottle - neck process of _",
    "( i ) _ transferring momentum from the spin system to phonons , and _",
    "( ii ) _ subsequent dissipation of the phonon momentum via an umklapp process or impurity scattering .",
    "the central idea is that the excess momentum of a spin - boson waits the longest time to get transfered to phonons , but once it is transferred it relaxes quickly . in other words , the phonon relaxation time @xmath22 due to",
    "phonon - phonon scattering is much shorter than the spin - phonon relaxation time @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath23 . as a result , the relaxation rate of such a two - stage process is determined by the `` normal '' spin - phonon scattering rate @xmath24^{-1}\\approx\\tau_{sp}^{-1}$ ] .",
    "the inequality @xmath25 can be justified qualitatively with the help of the following argumentation .",
    "first , the spin - lattice coupling is weak .",
    "second , since @xmath26 the phonon states have a significant thermal population at the temperatures where the spin contribution to the transport is substantial .",
    "furthermore , there is also a kinematic argument in favor of @xmath23 that results from our analysis .",
    "the leading contribution to the transport comes from the spin bosons with a small momentum @xmath27 .",
    "we find that the most effective scattering mechanism for such bosons is an absorption of a `` thermal '' phonon , that is a phonon whose energy is of the order of @xmath28 and momentum is of the order @xmath29 . for finite @xmath28",
    "such phonons have finite relaxation time @xmath30 .",
    "we will show that the spin bosons in question have a divergent relaxation time @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , for spin bosons with sufficiently small @xmath32 s the relevant phonon relaxation time @xmath30 is shorter than the spin - phonon relaxation time @xmath19 not only because of the weak spin - phonon coupling , but also due to the smallness of the characteristic momentum of the spin - boson , @xmath33 .    we have performed a detailed study of the kinematics of the spin - phonon scattering processes and obtained the corresponding transport relaxation rate @xmath34 for @xmath35 , and @xmath36 for @xmath37 , @xmath38 is a constant related to the spin - phonon coupling , @xmath39 .",
    "the characteristic power of @xmath40 in the relaxation rate can be traced back to the fact that spin excitations are confined to lower dimensions than phonons .",
    "the latter implies that it is only the momentum along the chains which is conserved in the spin - phonon scattering .",
    "this , in turn , leads to a larger scattering space for phonons and makes relaxation rate of the spin bosons @xmath41 .",
    "note that for the problem of the phonon - phonon scattering in 3d the phonon scattering rate is @xmath42 because the scattering space is restricted by the momentum conservation in all three dimensions.@xcite the temperature dependence of the relaxation rate is due to the bosonic nature of both the spin excitations and the phonons .",
    "thus , the spin - phonon relaxation rate obtained in this work should apply to other low - dimensional spin systems as well .    _ infrared divergence . _  however",
    ", one can find that the considered scattering mechanism becomes too weak at low energy and ineffective for the dissipation of the low - energy spin bosons .",
    "namely , within the formalism of boltzmann equation , @xmath43 leads to the infrared diverging thermal conductivity @xmath44 , @xmath45 , the situation familiar from the phonon thermal conductivity in 3d insulators.@xcite in that latter 3d phonon problem the regularization of such a divergence is non - trivial and involves a consideration of the higher - order phonon processes,@xcite degeneracy of phonon branches at high symmetry points,@xcite or scattering on boundaries .",
    "_ impurities .",
    "_  what physical effect can render @xmath46 finite in our case ?",
    "in contrast with the 3d systems , @xcite because of the 1d nature of spins , even a weak impurity potential will have a dramatic effect on the low - energy spin bosons .",
    "the impurities generate a relevant interaction in the renormalization group ( rg ) sense .",
    "that is , they scatter low - energy excitations very well destroying their quasi - ballistic propagation .",
    "below the so - called kane - fisher scale @xmath47 the scattering is very strong and leads to the localization of 1d excitations.@xcite on the other hand , at the temperatures well above this scale @xmath48 the impurity scattering can be analyzed perturbatively . as a consequence of such an analysis we find that impurities result in the momentum - independent scattering rate @xmath49 , @xmath50 being the impurity concentration .",
    "total scattering rate @xmath51 is finite at @xmath52 , which makes @xmath46 finite .",

    "lines @xmath449 and @xmath450 are bisectors @xmath467.,width=226 ]    keeping in mind the above results we rewrite the collision integral in the following form : @xmath468 where @xmath469 the contour @xmath470 is the union @xmath471 . for @xmath460 we must integrate between @xmath472 . for @xmath473 we must integrate between @xmath474 and between @xmath475 . in both cases",
    "a window of the width @xmath476 centered around @xmath477 must be deleted from the integration interval . in fig .",
    "[ fig_app ] one can identify this window with the unshaded area around line @xmath450 .",
    "we start by making the following observation . in general , the intervals @xmath470 in ( [ sell ] ) differ for different polarizations @xmath478 : the size of the gap around @xmath477 depends on the value of @xmath101 , so do @xmath479 which specify the outer limits of the integration intervals .",
    "however , we will show later that these variations in @xmath470 do not change the integrals ( [ sell ] ) significantly .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to introduce @xmath480 and @xmath481 . using this notation we write : @xmath482 as it was mentioned the integrals over @xmath483 in the above expressions are small .",
    "hence , it is permissible to integrate over @xmath484 in both @xmath485 and @xmath486 . in such a situation",
    "the summation over polarization @xmath96 can be done easily since in both @xmath485 and @xmath486 only the product @xmath487 depends on polarization .",
    "thus : @xmath488 where @xmath489 and @xmath490 .",
    "therefore , the collision integral itself is equal to : @xmath491 the first term of this integral can be calculated for small @xmath492 : @xmath493 which gives the spin - boson transport relaxation time : @xmath494 @xmath495 where @xmath496 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ gamma0 ] ) .",
    "one can see from eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) that the dominant scattering process is the absorption of a phonon with the characteristic energy @xmath497 as this energy range provides the major contribution to the integral .",
    "if we neglect the second term of ( [ sapp ] ) as well as the corrections to the collision integral coming from @xmath483 the function @xmath143 can be found right away .",
    "for example , if @xmath498 : @xmath499 this is the expression for odd ( in @xmath32 ) part of the spin boson distribution function . using it",
    "we estimate the omitted term of ( [ sapp ] ) and show that this term is small : @xmath500 \\frac{e^{-|k'|/k_t } - 1}{e^{-|k|/k_t } -1}f_{k'}^1.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] of three terms in the square brackets only the second gives non - vanishing contribution to the integral .",
    "two others do not contribute because they are even in @xmath106 and function @xmath501 is odd .",
    "therefore : @xmath502 where @xmath503 .",
    "since the integral in ( [ ax ] ) diverges at small @xmath504 we must introduce small cut - off parameter @xmath505 .",
    "such a cut - off is associated with the impurity scattering .",
    "it is equal to the momentum at which the impurity scattering rate becomes comparable with @xmath506 .",
    "for now it is enough to assume that @xmath505 is not too small so we can neglect the logarithm in the above formula . the expression ( [ ax ] )",
    "is to be compared with ( [ tau ] ) . for @xmath498 :",
    "@xmath507 in other words , at low temperatures the second term of ( [ sapp ] ) is small as long as @xmath508 .",
    "the same is true for larger temperature ( @xmath509 ) as well .",
    "we also need to estimate the integrals over @xmath483 to demonstrate that they are small .",
    "first , let us consider the integral over @xmath510 .",
    "this interval is localized near @xmath477 : @xmath511 \\cup   [ -(1 - 2c_t / v)k , -(1 - 2c_l / v)k].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is non - vanishing as long as @xmath512 .",
    "it is necessary to perform the integral ( [ sell ] ) with @xmath513 over @xmath510 : @xmath514 the absolute value of the last expression can be bounded from above by the following : @xmath515 the latter expression can be estimated as @xmath516 as long as @xmath517 .",
    "second , we estimate the integral ( [ sell ] ) with @xmath518 over @xmath519 : @xmath520 \\cup [ -|k| - \\theta_{dt}/v , -|k| - \\theta_{dl}/v].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is clear without extensive calculations that both terms of ( [ sell ] ) are proportional to @xmath521 .",
    "thus , the integral over this interval does not contribute significantly to the collision integral of the spin bosons ."
