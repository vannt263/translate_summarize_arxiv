    "a magnetic domain wall ( dw ) in a ferromagnetic nanowire is an important subject in spintronics .",
    "a new type of logic device is proposed  @xcite based on the dw dynamics and a dw - based memory is also proposed  @xcite , which may have merits such as nonvolatility , high speed , high density , and low power consumption .    the dynamics of a dw varies considerably depending on the relative strength of dw driving forces ( such as a magnetic field and a current ) with respect to disorders , which tend to suppress the dw motion . if the forces are sufficiently strong or the disorders are sufficiently weak  @xcite , the dw dynamics does not deviate much from the ideal dynamics in the absence of disorders . while some experiments  @xcite are estimated to be in this regime",
    ", many other experiments  @xcite appear to be in the regime where the disorders are important .",
    "it is thus desired to understand the dw dynamics in the weak driving force regime where the competition between the dw driving forces and the disorders is significant .",
    "the dw motion in the weak driving force regime is an important example in the field of driven interfaces .",
    "the study on driven interfaces has a long history  @xcite and addresses many physical systems such as surface growth of a crystal  @xcite , vortex line motion in high temperature superconductors  @xcite , and fluid propagation in porous media  @xcite . through a long series of theoretical works  @xcite",
    ", a simple picture has emerged ; the interface motion becomes collective and the collective length scale @xmath0  @xcite , which characterizes the length scale of collectively moving interface segments , diverges in the weak driving force limit . due to the divergence of @xmath0 , the interface has to overcome an increasingly larger energy barrier as the driving force becomes weaker , with the energy barrier @xmath1 as a function of the driving force @xmath2 diverging as a power law , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "interestingly the creep exponent @xmath5 is universal in the sense that its value does not change continuously with variations of system details and is affected only by a small number of key features such as the system dimensionality .",
    "systems with the same exponent are said to be in the same universality class .    this prediction has been unambiguously confirmed for the field - driven dw motion in metallic ferromagnets  @xcite , where the dw velocity @xmath6 is proportional to @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath9 is the temperature , @xmath10 is the magnetic field strength , and @xmath11 is a constant .",
    "note that this behavior of @xmath6 is a combined result of the power law scaling of the energy barrier @xmath12 and the arrhenius law  @xcite @xmath13 .",
    "the creep exponent @xmath5 is found to be @xmath14 , which agrees with the theoretically predicted value @xmath15 in two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems  @xcite .",
    "a pioneering experiment  @xcite revealed interesting twists . for nanowires made of a ferromagnetic semiconductor (",
    "ga , mn)as , the energy barrier for the field - driven dw motion was found to scale as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 instead of @xmath15 .",
    "this difference was attributed to the different nature of disorders ; while disorder potential energy is short - range correlated in metallic ferromagnets , it was argued that in ferromagnetic semiconductors , disorder _ force _ is short - range correlated . since the disorder potential energy is obtained by integrating the disorder force , it implies that the disorder potential energy is then long - range correlated  @xcite . for such cases ,",
    "it is known  @xcite that the nature of the correlation along the dw segments is modified and the value of @xmath5 indeed changes .",
    "another interesting twist of the experiment  @xcite is that for the current - driven dw motion , the effective energy barrier was reported to scale as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the current density and @xmath20 rather than @xmath15 or @xmath21 .",
    "thus two different creep exponent values ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) were obtained from the _ same _ material , implying that the current - driven dw motion is qualitatively different from the field - driven dw motion .",
    "it is believed that the current induces the dw motion in a nanowire by generating the spin transfer torque ( stt ) .",
    "the stt has two mutually orthogonal vector components , the adiabatic stt and the nonadiabatic stt  @xcite .",
    "the nonadibatic stt has similar properties as the magnetic field while the adiabatic stt has very different properties .",
    "thus the experimental result  @xcite implies that the nonadiabatic stt can not be the main driving force of the dw motion .",
    "in fact the exponent @xmath20 has been interpreted  @xcite as an indication that the current - driven dw motion is mainly due to the adiabatic stt .",
    "this interpretation is at odds , though not contradictory , with other results . in metallic ferromagnets ,",
    "the onset of the adiabatic - stt - driven dw motion is estimated  @xcite to occur at the current density of @xmath23 a/@xmath24 , which is unendurably high for most experimental systems .",
    "thus the dw motion realized at lower current densities are usually attributed to the nonadibatic stt .",
    "this situation strongly motivates experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite studies of the current - driven dw motion in metallic ferromagnets .",
    "this paper aims at theoretical explorations of this issue based on the observation that the dw anisotropy , characterizing the energy cost associated with the change in the tilting angle of the magnetization inside a dw , is orders of magnitude larger in metallic ferromagnets than in ferromagnetic semiconductors .",
    "since the dw anisotropy tends to suppress variations of the tilting angle , we assume that the dw creep motion in metallic ferromagnets exhibits the below - the - walker - breakdown - like behavior in the sense that the amplitude of the tilting angle variations during the creep motion stays much smaller than @xmath25 . for the field - driven dw",
    "creep motion , this assumption is experimentally supported since the experimental value @xmath26 of the creep exponent agrees with the prediction @xmath15 of the theory  @xcite , in which the tilting angle dynamics is completely suppressed . for the current - driven dw",
    "creep motion , the assumption requires an experimental confirmation . a recent experiment  @xcite reports the purely current - driven dw creep motion in metallic ferromagnets . for ferromagnetic semiconductors , in contrast",
    ", it appears that the assumption may not be valid . for the current - driven dw creep motion ,",
    "it was argued  @xcite that each thermally - assisted tunneling event overcomes the energy barrier generated by the dw anisotropy , implying that each tunneling event is accompanied by the tilting angle change by @xmath27 .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:1d ] , we discuss the dw depinning from a single potential well in one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems .",
    "analysis of this relatively simple problem clearly illustrates separate roles of the magnetic field , the adiabatic stt , and the nonadiabatic stt on the thermally - assisted tunneling of a dw .",
    "it also allows one to identify relevant factors affecting the tunneling , which therefore should be included in the analysis . in this sense , sec .",
    "[ sec:1d ] is pedagogical .",
    "nevertheless predictions in sec .",
    "[ sec:1d ] can be tested in real experiments since a dw exhibits the 1d dynamics  @xcite when @xmath0 becomes larger than both the thickness and width of a nanowire .",
    "in particular , it is predicted that when the depinning rate is used as a tool to evaluate the nonadiabaticity parameter  @xcite , characterizing the strength of the nonadibatic stt , it may lead to incorrect values if disorders in a nanowire have certain features . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2d ] , the dw creep motion in 2d systems is analyzed .",
    "separate roles of the magnetic field , the adiabatic stt , and the nonadiabatic stt on the creep motion are clarified .",
    "in addition to the leading order contribution to the creep motion in the vanishing dw driving force limit , next leading order contributions are also obtained .",
    "although the next leading order contributions are irrelevant as far as the theoretical determination of the creep exponent and the universality class is concerned , they may nevertheless be relevant in _ experimental _ determination of the creep exponent since experiments are always performed at small but _ finite _ driving force strength . at the end of both secs .",
    "[ sec:1d ] and [ sec:2d ] , effects of the rashba spin - orbit coupling ( rsoc ) are discussed .",
    "the emergence of the rsoc in ferromagnetic nanowires is recently demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] concludes this paper .",
    "when both the thickness and the width of a magnetic nanowire are sufficiently smaller than the collective length @xmath28 , the system reduces to a 1d problem and the configuration of a dw can be described by two variables , the dw position @xmath29 and the tilting angle @xmath30 .",
    "this section examines the dw depinning from a potential well in this 1d regime .      in the 1d regime",
    ", the response of the dw collective coordinates @xmath31 to an external magnetic field @xmath10 and/or an electric current of density @xmath19 is described by the following equations , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the gilbert damping parameter , @xmath34 is the dw width , @xmath35 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath36 is the saturation magnetization , @xmath37 is the cross - sectional area of a nanowire , @xmath38 is the dw potential energy , and the dimensionless parameter @xmath39 is the nonadiabaticity coefficient  @xcite representing the strength of the nonadiabatic stt .",
    "@xmath40 @xmath41 is a constant with the dimension @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the spin - polarization of the current , and @xmath44 is the planck constant . in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1deom1 ] ) and ( [ eq:1deom2 ] ) , the sign convention of @xmath19 is chosen in such a way that positive @xmath19 drives the dw towards the positive @xmath29 direction . on the other hand , the sign convention of @xmath10 should depend on the types of the dw ; in nanowires with the in - plane anisotropy , for instance , opposite signs should be adopted for the head - to - head and tail - to - tail dws . below for simplicity , we consider one particular sign only , and assume that the positive @xmath10 tends to drive the dw towards the positive @xmath29 direction .",
    "the dw potential energy @xmath38 consists of the dw anisotropy energy @xmath45 and a disorder potential energy , where @xmath46 represents the strength of the dw anisotropy . here",
    "@xmath30 is defined in a way that @xmath47 for the tilting angle preferred by the dw anisotropy .",
    "when the disorder potential energy depends only on @xmath29 , eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1deom1 ] ) and ( [ eq:1deom2 ] ) become equivalent to eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) in ref .  .",
    "in general , however , the disorder potential energy may also depend on @xmath30 .",
    "such @xmath30 dependence of @xmath48 may arise in various ways .",
    "for instance , the value of @xmath36 may fluctuate from position to position . recalling that @xmath46 depends  @xcite on @xmath36 , @xmath46",
    "can then be decomposed into its spatial average part and the fluctuating part @xmath49 . the fluctuating part of the dw anisotropy energy [ @xmath50 may be absorbed to @xmath48 to generate its @xmath30 dependence",
    ". similar dependence may arise from the position - to - position fluctuation of @xmath37 . in these types of disorder ,",
    "the preferred tilting angle remains unaffected and only the strength of the dw anisotropy fluctuates .",
    "some types of disorder may generate opposite effects . in a magnetic nanowire with the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy ( pma ) ,",
    "the interface between the magnetic layer and the neighboring layer plays important roles for the anisotropy .",
    "when the interface is not perfectly flat and becomes rough@xcite , the preferred anisotropy direction fluctuates from position to position . in this case , the preferred tilting angle fluctuates while the strength of the dw anisotropy may not fluctuate .",
    "below we consider this general situation , in which the disorder potential energy depends both on @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in ref .",
    ", the @xmath30 dependence of the disorder potential energy is included in its initial formulation but ignored when the depinning rate is calculated .",
    "we demonstrate below that the @xmath30 dependence of @xmath48 generates interesting consequences .",
    "based on the lagrangian formulation , eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1deom1 ] ) and ( [ eq:1deom2 ] ) may be considered as the lagrange s equations of the lagrangian @xmath51 and the dissipation function @xmath52 , @xmath53 the lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) is then transformed to the hamiltonian _",

    "thus some care should be exercised when eq .",
    "( [ eq:1den ] ) is used to analyze the dw dynamics above the walker breakdown threshold , where @xmath30 changes more than @xmath25 . below the walker breakdown threshold ,",
    "on the other hand , the dynamics of @xmath30 is confined to a value range narrower than @xmath25 and @xmath58 can be regarded as a single valued function .",
    "figure  [ fig:1dmodel ] shows schematically the energy profile , to which the dw is subject .",
    "the dw has to overcome an energy barrier to get depinned from a given potential well . when the dw driving force ( @xmath10 or @xmath19 ) is small , the height of the energy barrier is sufficiently higher than the dw energy measured from the bottom of the potential well and the dw overcomes the large energy barrier by exploiting the thermal agitation .",
    "thus the depinning time from potential wells is governed ( within the exponential accuracy ) by the energy barrier via the arrhenius law .",
    "when the depinning time is much longer than the relaxation time inside potential wells , the energy barrier is defined as the difference between the saddle point energy and the local ground state energy .",
    "one remark is in order .",
    "while the arrhenius law is based on the fluctuation - dissipation theorem@xcite , the theorem does not generally hold when @xmath19 is finite and the system is thus in nonequilibrium situations .",
    "however it has been demonstrated that for small @xmath19  @xcite and below the walker breakdown regime  @xcite , thermal fluctuations still satisfy the theorem , justifying the use of the arrhenius law in this case .",

    "a possible way to avoid the incorrect evaluation of @xmath39 in this case is to take an average of @xmath104 for multiple potential wells .",
    "since the sign of @xmath93 is expected to fluctuate from potential wells to potential wells , this averaging process may be able to remove the second contribution of @xmath104 proportional to @xmath93 . by the way",
    ", the sign fluctuations of @xmath105 can be suppressed in this averaging process since the depinning to the right ( @xmath106 ) and to the left ( @xmath107 ) are distinguishable in experiments .",
    "lastly we compare two contributions [ third and fourth lines in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1deb ] ) ] , both of which generate the @xmath19-quadratic contributions to @xmath1 .",
    "they have one important difference ; the third line , which arises from the nonadiabatic stt , always enhance @xmath1 and thereby lower the depinning rate while the fourth line , which arises from the adiabatic stt , may either increase or decrease @xmath1 since @xmath94 can be positive or negative depending on the nature of disorders .",

    "has the same structure as eq .   except that the last term of eq .",
    "is multiplied by the extra factor @xmath334 , the energy barrier @xmath201 for the creep motion can be obtained straightforwardly from eq .  .",
    "for metallic ferromagnets with @xmath220 , the effective field for the bloch dw in the presence of the rsoc is given by the equation identical to eq .",
    "except @xmath335 is now replaced by @xmath336 .",
    "the leading correction due to the rsoc(@xmath337 ) appears in terms of cubic and higher orders of @xmath19 and thus , we conclude that the rsoc does not modify the dw creep motion qualitatively in small @xmath19 regime .      the magnetization direction at the center of the nel dw points along the nanowire direction ( @xmath174 direction ) .",

    "it is then evident that the rsoc renormalizes the adiabatic stt effect by the renormalization factor @xmath343 .    with this knowledge",
    ", the energy barrier @xmath201 can be obtained in a straightforward way . for metallic ferromagnets with @xmath220 , the effective field for the nel dw",
    "is given by the equation identical to eq .",
    "except replacing @xmath335 by @xmath344 .",
    "note that the correction by nonzero @xmath165 again appears in rather high order terms in @xmath19 .",
    "thus we conclude that the rsoc does not modify the creep motion of the nel dw qualitatively .",
    "magnetic dw motion in a nanowire was examined in the weak driving force regime with particular attention to metallic ferromagnets , where the dw anisotropy is very large .",
    "effects of the magnetic field , the adiabatic stt , and the nonadiabatic stt on the dw motion were examined under the assumption that the amplitude of the tilting angle dynamics is much smaller than @xmath25 . to be more specific , we examined two phenomena , the dw depinning from a single potential well in 1d systems , and the dw creep motion through a disordered potential profile in 2d systems .",
    "the analysis on the 1d depinning becomes relevant when both the width and the thickness of a nanowire are smaller than the collective length @xmath0 .",
    "the nonadiabatic stt has the same effect as the magnetic field , and together , they generate the leading order contribution to the depinning rate .",
    "we found that the way that the adiabatic stt affects the dw depinning depends on the nature of disorders .",
    "in particular , it was demonstrated that in certain types of disorders , the conventional ways to determine the nonadiabaticity parameter @xmath39 result in incorrect values .",
    "possible ways to avoid the incorrect evaluation have been proposed .",
    "the analysis on the 2d creep motion becomes relevant when the width of a nanowire is larger than @xmath0 while the thickness remains smaller than @xmath0 .",
    "a thermally - assisted dw velocity is determined by the energy barrier @xmath201 between two spatially adjacent local minimum configurations in the dw energy profile .",
    "the contribution of the non - adiabatic stt ( @xmath345 ) to @xmath201 is the same as that of the magnetic field .",
    "the role of the adiabatic stt , however , is qualitatively different from those of the non - adiabatic stt and the magnetic field . efficiencies of driving forces ( magnetic field and current ) are described in terms of the total effective magnetic field .",
    "both the magnetic field and the non - adiabatic stt generate linear contributions to the total effective magnetic field , implying that the purely field - driven and purely current - driven dw creep motions belong to the same universality class .",
    "the adiabatic stt , on the other hand , generates @xmath19-quadratic or higher order contributions to the total effective magnetic field , and thus its contributions constitute the next leading order contributions .",
    "although these contributions are irrelevant in the vanishing driving force limit , their effects may need to be taken into account in practical scaling analysis since experiments are always carried out at small but finite driving force strength .",
    "effects of the rashba spin - orbit coupling ( rsoc ) on the dw depinning in 1d systems and on the dw creep in 2d systems are also discussed . for a bloch wall in a nanowire with the pma , the rsoc effect appears in terms of cubic and higher orders of @xmath19 in the effective energy barrier .",
    "for a nel wall in a nanowire with the pma , the rsoc affects the effective energy barrier in a way similar to the adiabatic stt .",
    "thus , its contribution to the energy barrier appears in quadratic and higher orders of @xmath19 .",
