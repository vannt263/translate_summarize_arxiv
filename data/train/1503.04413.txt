    "the proof of theorem  [ thm_sampling ] is considered as an extension of lyapunov s direct method , where the decay condition for a lyapunov function is guaranteed by exploiting the volterra expansion instead of using the time derivative along the trajectories .",
    "although the exponential stability result is established for @xmath43-solutions under a sampling strategy , simulation results demonstrate the convergence of classical solutions of the closed - loop system to its equilibrium .",
