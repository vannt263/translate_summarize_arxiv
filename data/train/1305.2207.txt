    "the action is the most important quantity in classical physics .",
    "general relativity ( gr ) is the most important classical field theory . understanding the action of gr is therefore of the utmost interest .",
    "this is not diminished by the expectation that classical gr is just a limit of some quantum theory . indeed , whatever the underlying theory , we know that gr defines its effective large - distance action . as such , the gr action is the _ result _ of a quantum - gravitational path integral .",
    "thus , special properties of the gr action may tell us something about this path integral .",
    "such an approach has been successful in the euclidean derivation @xcite of black hole entropy @xcite .",
    "there , the bekenstein - hawking entropy was extracted from an imaginary euclidean action .",
    "recently , it was noticed @xcite that the gravitational action @xmath0 in a bounded _",
    "region generically has an imaginary part .",
    "this imaginary part arises from the action s boundary term , when the latter is integrated over `` flip surfaces '' - codimension-2 surfaces where the boundary flips its signature and becomes momentarily null .",
    "such flip surfaces are always present for a closed boundary , though they may be `` hidden '' at topological corners . as the normal becomes null at a flip surface , the boundary s extrinsic curvature diverges .",
    "the resulting divergence in the action s boundary term can be resolved by a deformation of the integration contour into the complex plane . in the process",
    ", an imaginary part is picked up .",
    "it has thus become clear that an imaginary gravitational action is a feature not just of euclidean spacetimes , but also of finite , non - stationary regions of realistic lorentzian solutions .",
    "moreover , it turns out that the imaginary part of the lorentzian action reproduces the black hole entropy formula , in the following precise way : @xmath1 here , the sum is over all the `` flip surfaces '' in the region s boundary .",
    "@xmath2 is the result of evaluating the black hole entropy formula on each flip surface .",
    "the relation was derived in @xcite by explicit calculation for gr with minimally - coupled matter and for lovelock gravity .",
    "the derivation can be trivially extended to e.g. scalar fields with non - minimal couplings of the form @xmath3 .",
    "for lovelock gravity or non - minimal couplings , one should use in not the bekenstein - hawking entropy , but its generalization due to wald @xcite .    in higher - derivative theories , the entropy formula for a stationary black hole does nt extend unambiguously to non - stationary geometries .",
    "in this case , eq . selects a particular non - stationary formula for @xmath2 . for lovelock gravity , a non - trivial calculation in @xcite results in a formula that depends solely on the intrinsic geometry of the flip surface .",
    "this is consistent with the non - stationary entropy formula proposed in @xcite .",
    "eq . can not be applied to general diff - invariant theories , since it requires knowledge of the action s boundary term .",
    "thus , the result s natural scope is the class of theories that contain no more than two time derivatives . in such theories ,",
    "the boundary term is determined by requiring a well - defined variational principle , with only the boundary metric ( along with other configuration fields ) held fixed . for pure gravity ,",
    "the only such theories are of the lovelock type .",
    "thus , the only cases not covered in @xcite are non - minimal matter couplings . in this paper",
    ", we will explicitly consider mostly lovelock gravity .",
    "we do so with the understanding that adding minimally - coupled matter is trivial , and with the expectation that the same principles should apply to all two - time - derivative theories .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the action s imaginary part does nt affect the action variations that one encounters in hamiltonian evolution .",
    "this is because such variations leave the intrinsic geometry of flip surfaces , and therefore @xmath4 , unchanged .",
    "we note here that one can also reverse that argument .",
    "having accepted a non - vanishing @xmath4 , one can use the reality of the action variations in hamiltonian evolution to _ explain _ the dependence of @xmath4 on only the intrinsic metric of the flip surfaces .    in this paper ,",
    "we continue to explore the imaginary part of the gravity action . in section [ sec :",
    "derive ] , we rederive @xmath4 for lovelock gravity , with gr as a special case . in the process , we draw a parallel with the euclidean calculation in @xcite .",
    "this enables us to explain the relation between @xmath4 and the entropy formula , as well as to elucidate the topological structure of @xmath4 in lovelock gravity . in section [ sec : gh ] , we focus on stationary black hole solutions , and evaluate the action for lorentzian regions that mimic the euclidean spacetimes of @xcite .",
    "the result , given in eq . , features a clean separation between the action s real and imaginary parts : while the real part consists of terms related to conserved charges , the imaginary part consists of terms related to the entropy .    in section [ sec : diamonds ] , we evaluate @xmath4 for causal - diamond - like boundaries that span a maximal portion of some symmetric spacetime .",
    "such boundaries coincide , in part or in full , with killing horizons and with the spacetime s asymptotic boundary .",
    "the geometries studied include minkowski space , the rindler wedge , pure ads , ds and ds@xmath5 spaces , as well as stationary black holes with either flat or ads asymptotics .",
    "for the regions examined , we find that @xmath4 agrees with the relevant horizon entropy , with the exception of the de - sitter example ( there is a factor - of-2 discrepancy , which disappears if one studies ds@xmath5 instead ) . in section [ sec : near_horizon ] , we examine local near - horizon regions for both stationary and non - stationary black holes .",
    "the imaginary action for such regions again agrees with the black hole entropy .",
    "we propose a heuristic interpretation of these local regions as `` effective '' asymptotic spacetimes for highly accelerated near - horizon observers . for non - stationary black holes ,",
    "the relevant horizon for this interpretation is the teleological event horizon .",
    "it should be kept in mind that the general physical meaning of the action s imaginary part is unclear . in a euclidean situation",
    ", it is usually understood that the imaginary action describes a partition function . in the lorentzian ,",
    "not much can be said with certainty . considering transition amplitudes @xmath6",
    ", one sees that while @xmath7 is a phase , @xmath4 determines the amplitude s absolute value @xmath8 .",
    "thus , a positive @xmath4 implies exponentially damped amplitudes , which one may associate with an exponentially large number @xmath9 of available states .    despite the lack of a detailed physical understanding ,",
    "two circumstances should be kept in mind .",
    "first , a nonvanishing @xmath4 does come out in an honest evaluation of the boundary - term integral , and should thus be taken seriously .",
    "second , the result refers primarily to finite spacetime regions , where the physical content of quantum gravity is itself unclear .",
    "indeed , the only well - understood quantum gravity observables @xcite are the s - matrix in asymptotically flat space and boundary cft correlators in asymptotically ads space @xcite . in ads",
    "/ cft , the relationship between cft observables and bounded regions in the bulk is not entirely clear .",
    "a notable exception is the poincare patch of ads , which is cleanly associated with observables on a conformal minkowski patch of the ads boundary . as for s - matrix elements in",
    "asymptotically flat space , they are associated with the conformally compact region containing the entire spacetime . in section [ sec : diamonds ] , we will argue that @xmath4 actually vanishes in these two special cases .",
    "thus , a generally non - vanishing @xmath4 does nt seem to contradict any existing knowledge , but may in fact further our understanding of observables in quantum gravity .    in the formulas and figures below",

    "let us specialize to a spacelike corner @xmath40 , which is the relevant case for signature flips .",
    "at each point of @xmath40 , the 1 + 1d plane orthogonal to it is spanned by two null vectors @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",

    "we can fix the scalar product @xmath56 , which leaves the relative scaling of @xmath54 and @xmath55 arbitrary .",
    "as we traverse the corner `` along the bend '' , the boundary normal @xmath27 gets rotated ( and rescaled ) in the plane spanned by @xmath57 .",
    "we can thus write @xmath27 as a linear combination of the two null vectors : @xmath58 we imagine @xmath59 changing continuously from an initial value @xmath60 on one side of the corner to a final value @xmath61 on the other side .",
    "@xmath62 may change as well , but this will have no effect on our calculation . the change in @xmath59",

    "the overall scaling of @xmath60 and @xmath61 depends on the arbitrary relative scaling of @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "now , the extrinsic curvature components @xmath50 in can be written as : @xmath66 where we used the fact that @xmath67 , since @xmath54 and @xmath55 are orthogonal to @xmath40 .",

    "consider now a corner @xmath40 at which the boundary changes its signature e.g. from spacelike to timelike .",
    "as explained in @xcite , the imaginary contribution to the action at flip surfaces can always be expressed in terms of such corners . in particular ,",
    "an apparently smooth signature flip ( figure [ fig : smooth_normal ] ) can be thought of as a limiting case of a corner , with the corner s angle not vanishing in the limit .",
    "this is possible because a fixed spacelike - timelike corner angle can be made to appear arbitrarily `` blunt '' by boosting the reference frame . as for corners containing more than one signature flip ,",
    "e.g. when the normal changes from past - pointing timelike to future - pointing timelike , their contribution to @xmath4 is a simple multiple of that from a single flip .",
    "let the corner @xmath40 , then , contain a single signature flip . in terms of the decomposition of the normal @xmath27",
    ", this means that the coefficient @xmath59 changes sign , passing through zero ( assuming without loss of generality that @xmath27 crosses through the null direction of @xmath54 ) . as was noticed in @xcite , the corner angle @xmath72 in this case has an imaginary part @xmath73 . in our present formalism , this can be seen as the result of deforming the @xmath74 integral to avoid the @xmath75 pole in @xmath76 .",
    "the angle s imaginary part can then be read off from the closed contour integral around the pole : @xmath77 in gr , this result translates immediately into the action s imaginary part . in more general theories",
    ", we must perform the same contour deformation on the @xmath74 integral in the corner contribution .",
    "the singularity at @xmath75 is no longer a simple pole , but the closed contour integral still picks out the @xmath78 term .",
    "this leads to the following imaginary part : @xmath79 summing over all flip surfaces , we express @xmath4 as : @xmath80    the overall sign in - depends on the orientation of the @xmath57 basis , as well as on the whether we bypass the @xmath75 singularity from above or from below .",
    "we choose the sign in such a way that ( at least in gr ) the action s imaginary part comes out positive .",
    "this prevents the transition amplitudes @xmath81 from becoming exponentially large .",
    "we note that this sign choice can be consistently maintained only for `` causally convex '' boundaries . for arbitrary jagged boundaries , some of the flip surfaces must give negative contributions , so that the net number of flips along a closed curve in 1 + 1d remains four .",
    "this is necessary",
    "e.g. to ensure that the total boost angle for a closed circuit in the lorentzian plane remains @xmath82 .",
    "non - convex boundaries can be accounted for in by inserting a factor of @xmath83 at each flip surface .",
    "corner contributions to the action with varying boundary signature have been considered before @xcite .",
    "the recipe given there differs from ours precisely by the absence of @xmath4 .",
    "this translates into taking the principal part of the @xmath74 integral through the @xmath75 pole . in terms of the complex @xmath59 plane ,",
    "this principal part is the average of two proper integrals - one along a contour bypassing @xmath75 from below , and the other bypassing from above .",
    "thus , a real action results from averaging over the two contours instead of choosing one , as we ve done above .",
    "we submit that this procedure is unnatural . to reiterate the argument from @xcite ,",
    "if both contour integrals counted as valid `` histories '' , quantum mechanics would tell us to sum ( or average ) their two amplitudes @xmath6 , rather than their actions @xmath0 .",
    "but then the contour with @xmath84 would dominate , leading to an exponentially exploding overall amplitude .",
    "we therefore believe that choosing the contour with @xmath85 is the more correct procedure .      in the above",
    ", we outlined the prescription @xcite for explicitly calculating the action s imaginary part .",
    "our present goal is to explain the structure of the result , in particular its relation to the entropy formula and the topological structure of @xmath4 . roughly speaking",
    ", we will do this by relating the closed integration contour in to a small circle in euclidean spacetime .",
    "consider a closed codimension-2 surface @xmath40 in a euclidean spacetime .",
    "around each point of @xmath40 , we draw a small circle @xmath86 in the orthogonal 2d plane .",
    "let @xmath87 be the disk bounded by the @xmath86 circle .",
    "let us now write down the gravitational action for the region @xmath88 , with boundary @xmath89 .",
    "as always in the euclidean , this action will be purely imaginary .    since the @xmath86 circle is small , the dominant curvature in the problem is the extrinsic curvature component @xmath41 along the circle .",
    "thus , the dominant contribution to the action comes from the pieces proportional to @xmath41 in the boundary term .",
    "we are thus led to euclidean analogues of eqs .",
    "- : @xmath90 the euclidean factor of @xmath91 can be seen as arising from the minus sign in the square root in .",
    "the overall sign follows the convention of @xcite , which makes the kinetic term in @xmath92 positive .",
    "now , the extrinsic curvature factors in can again be expressed in terms of a basis of null vectors .",
    "the 2d plane of the @xmath86 circle is spanned by two _ complex _ null vectors @xmath93 , which are complex - conjugate to each other .",
    "we again normalize so that @xmath94 , which leaves the phase of @xmath95 arbitrary .",
    "the boundary normal @xmath27 can be expressed as a linear combination of @xmath95 and @xmath96 as follows : @xmath97 with @xmath59 now a complex coefficient of unit norm ( the overall scaling @xmath62 can be complex as well ) .",
    "as the normal is transported along the @xmath86 circle , its rotation angle is given by : @xmath98 as @xmath27 goes once around the @xmath86 circle , @xmath59 goes _ twice _ around the unit circle in the complex plane .",
    "we are implicitly neglecting any deficit angle , since the @xmath86 circle is small .    as in eq . , the tangential components @xmath50 of the extrinsic curvature can now be expressed in terms of @xmath99 and @xmath100 : @xmath101 plugging into the action formula , we get : @xmath102    the formulas and are very similar .",
    "crucially , the function @xmath49 in both formulas is the same .",
    "we ve thus related the imaginary part of the action for an arbitrary lorentzian region to the full action for a special euclidean region .",
    "we can now give a topological reason for the result @xcite that @xmath4 depends only on the intrinsic metric of @xmath40 .",
    "for the euclidean action , this fact was understood in @xcite .",
    "the argument of @xcite is as follows .",

    "but the latter can be written as a local integral using only the intrinsic metric of @xmath40 .",
    "the same must be true for @xmath36 , since the only difference is the dimension of the integrals in .",

    "another important feature of the euclidean action is its direct relation to the black hole entropy formula .",
    "given a stationary black hole spacetime , one can wick - rotate its external region to a `` euclidean '' section @xcite .",

    "the @xmath116 coordinate becomes degenerate there , so that @xmath119 is not a codimension-1 hypersurface but a codimension-2 surface .",
    "this is just the bifurcation surface , which we used in section [ sec : derive : entropy ] .",
    "thus , the euclidean spacetime `` covers '' only the patch outside the horizon .",
    "consider now the action @xmath120 for the `` entire euclidean spacetime '' , i.e. for a region bounded by @xmath121 with @xmath122 very large .",
    "thermal qft suggests that @xmath123 should be interpreted as @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the partition function .",

    "the exterior cutoff will have the same effect as in the euclidean : it regularizes the divergent contribution associated with the `` baseline '' action of empty space . note that regardless of the radial cutoffs , our boundary must pass near the bifurcation surface .",

    "we can express them either by substituting into or by directly reading off the imaginary contribution at a flip surface from : @xmath163 here , @xmath114 is the entropy functional evaluated at the bifurcation surface .",

    "the result is unusual , in that it involves the smaller tip areas rather than the larger equator areas .",
    "as argued in @xcite , this can be understood in terms of the entropy available to an observer who starts and finishes his experiment at the tips , as opposed to the entropy that is `` potentially there in space '' .",

    "when discussing the action and entropy of stationary black holes , this indeed makes sense : asymptotically flat and ads spacetimes admit such solutions , while asymptotically de - sitter ones do not .",
    "it is also interesting to consider the analogue of figure [ fig : minkowski](a ) in pure de - sitter and ads spacetimes . unlike in minkowski space",

    ", two possible notions of a `` maximal diamond '' come to mind .",
    "the first of these is depicted in figure [ fig : ads](a ) .",

    "are related in the same way as the asymptotically flat diamonds in figures [ fig : minkowski](a ) and [ fig : kruskal](b ) .",
    "+    the other possible notion of a `` maximal diamond '' in ads is a poincare patch , depicted in figure [ fig : ads](b ) .",
    "the boundary of the poincare patch consists of the timelike ads boundary and two spacelike hypersurfaces , one initial and one final . at spatial infinity ,",
    "the two spacelike boundaries become asymptotically null .",
    "there is a @xmath202-parameter family of poincare patches , depending e.g. on the intersection point of the spacelike hypersurfaces at spatial infinity .",
    "the signature flips on the boundary of the poincare patch occur at the codimension-2 intersections between its spacelike and timelike components . while these intersections are not pointlike , they are null , and",
    "should thus be associated with a vanishing area ( in the conformal geometry of the ads boundary , they play the roles of past and future null infinity ) .",
    "thus , we again get @xmath192 , in accordance with the vanishing entropy of a poincare patch in ads .",
    "note that we used here the restriction to gr with minimal couplings : otherwise , it is nt obvious that @xmath185 vanishes for flip surfaces with vanishing area .    finally , let us turn to de - sitter space .",
    "there , the natural candidate for a `` maximal diamond '' is a null - bounded region whose equator is a codimension-2 equatorial sphere . without loss of generality",
    ", we can place this sphere at the center of the standard square penrose diagram .",
    "the two lightsheets passing through the equatorial sphere have a constant cross - section area @xmath190 .",
    "they never focus at a finite bulk point , but instead focus conformally at timelike infinity .",
    "one can define a maximal diamond by stretching two non - parallel lightsheet segments from the equator to timelike infinity , one past - going and the other future - going .",
    "the resulting shape is depicted as the shaded region in figure [ fig : ds](a ) .",
    "there is a @xmath203-parameter family of such diamonds , determined by the positions of the two tip points .     and ( b ) elliptic de - sitter space @xmath204 .",
    "every point in the penrose diagrams is a sphere @xmath205 in spacetime . in ( b ) , each sphere is identified with the sphere that lies opposite from it across the diagram s center .",

    "the numbered arrows trace a continuous null path along the diamond s boundary.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    along each of the two lightsheets in figure [ fig : ds](a ) , there is a spherical signature - flip surface .",
    "each of these flip surfaces contributes @xmath206 to @xmath4 .",
    "the imaginary part of the action thus evaluates to : @xmath207 which is _ half _ of the entropy @xmath195 usually associated with de - sitter space ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is a somewhat disappointing result , since it breaks the @xmath200 pattern .",
    "it turns out that the mismatch disappears if we consider not a standard de - sitter space @xmath208 , but an `` elliptical '' de - sitter space @xmath204 .",
    "this space is obtained by identifying antipodal points related through @xmath209 .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that @xmath204 is a more suitable arena for quantum gravity than @xmath208 .",
    "the `` maximal diamond '' in @xmath204 is depicted as the shaded region in figure [ fig : ds](b ) .",
    "each point on the penrose diagram is identified with the opposite point across the diagram s center . in particular",
    ", opposite corners of the square are identified .",
    "these identifications involve also passing to the antipodal point in the @xmath205 spheres that reside at each point of the 2d diagram .    the arrows in figure [ fig : ds](b ) trace a typical continuous null path around the boundary of the `` maximal diamond '' .",
    "the numbers indicate the order in which the four segments are traversed .",
    "segments 3 - 4 are at an antipodal point of the @xmath205 sphere from segments 1 - 2 .",
    "there is no global time orientation in @xmath204 , and the same is true of our `` maximal diamond '' .",
    "however , the local causal structure of the diamond s boundary is almost the same as the standard one in figure [ fig : null_boundary ] . in particular , the center of the penrose diagram functions as an equator , while the two inequivalent corners function as tips .",
    "the only local difference is that now at every equator point , all four transverse null directions belong to the boundary . as always in @xmath204 ,",
    "the overall inconsistency of the time orientation is apparent only to observers at timelike infinity .",
    "let us now calculate @xmath4 for the diamond in figure [ fig : ds](b ) .",
    "since antipodal points are identified , we may focus on e.g. the left half of the penrose diagram .",
    "there , we again have a single flip surface on each of the two lightsheets .",
    "each flip surface again contributes @xmath210 to the action s imaginary part .",
    "overall , we get : @xmath211 where @xmath212 is the area of the codimension-2 equator sphere after the @xmath213 identification . thus , the imaginary action coincides with the entropy @xmath214 of the `` halved '' de - sitter space @xmath204 .",
    "in sections [ sec : gh]-[sec : diamonds ] , we evaluated @xmath4 for a selection of regions .",
    "these regions were all situated in symmetric spacetimes and involved knowledge of asymptotic infinity .",
    "these are the contexts in which our understanding of quantum gravity and black hole entropy is at its firmest .",
    "thus , the analysis in sections [ sec : gh]-[sec : diamonds ] is essential in order to make contact with existing approaches .",
    "however , in some sense , this analysis misses the conceptual novelty of eq . .",
    "indeed , it s important that not only knows about the entropy formula , but is also very general : it applies to arbitrary regions , with no requirements of symmetry or asymptotics .",
    "it may therefore provide a window into the situations where quantum gravity is conceptually hard .",
    "thus , along with stationary asymptotic regions , it is important to also study regions that are more dynamical and local in nature .    the first item on this agenda should be to say something about non - stationary black holes .",
    "indeed , the discussion in section [ sec : diamonds : maximal ] ( as well as the examples in @xcite ) assumed perfect stationarity , including a bifurcate killing horizon .",
    "this is a very restrictive assumption , which excludes all astrophysical black holes - even ones that settle into stationarity after their formation .",
    "in addition , realistic black holes exist in a universe which , by our present understanding of cosmology , asymptotes in the future to de - sitter space .",
    "thus , the flat or ads asymptotics from figure [ fig : kruskal ] are most probably wrong . in any case ,",
    "accelerated - expansion cosmology renders spatial infinity inaccessible .",
    "therefore , in addition to non - stationarity , it is important to consider _ local _ regions in black hole spacetimes , without assuming knowledge of the asymptotics . in this section ,",
    "we make tentative steps in these directions .",
    "since we ll be considering boundaries with nearly constant cross - sections , we no longer require the area monotonicity results from gr .",
    "thus , the discussion below applies to general theories of gravity with two time derivatives .",
    "consider again a stationary black hole .",
    "a standard trick is to approximate the near - horizon region with a rindler geometry . in this picture , the accelerated observers outside the horizon get reinterpreted as accelerated rindler observers .",
    "the origin of the rindler wedge corresponds to the black hole s bifurcation surface .",
    "it is then interesting to ask , what does the asymptotic boundary of the rindler space correspond to ? clearly , it does nt exist anywhere in the original black hole spacetime , since the rindler approximation breaks down at large radii . however , we propose that it s useful to _ imagine _ the asymptotic boundary of the rindler space situated a small distance outside the black hole horizon .",
    "this encapsulates the notion of the rindler space being a near - horizon approximation : the farthest distances in the rindler space correspond to small finite distances in the black hole spacetime .",
    "pictorially , we propose to associate a small finite diamond as in figure [ fig : kruskal](a ) with the entire rindler wedge from figure [ fig : minkowski](c ) .",
    "the codimension-2 section @xmath189 of the rindler wedge is then identified with the bifurcation surface .",
    "the smallness of the finite diamond is expressed through the fact that this section remains approximately constant . in particular",
    ", it implies that @xmath215 in figure [ fig : kruskal](a ) .",
    "we note that a finite diamond can not capture the full domain of the near - horizon approximation , which is valid along the entire extent of the bifurcate horizon .",
    "however , the diamond can be made arbitrarily long in one of the null directions , while becoming narrower in the other . in this way",
    ", a single diamond can capture the near - horizon region arbitrarily far along one horizon branch , e.g. along the future horizon .",
    "now , as calculated in section [ sec : diamonds : maximal ] , the action s imaginary part for both the finite diamond and the infinite rindler wedge reproduces the black hole s",
    "entropy @xmath114 ( due to the constant cross - section , the generalization beyond gr is straightforward ) .",
    "we have , then , a physical picture that involves an agreement between @xmath4 and @xmath114 , but makes no mention of the asymptotics in the black hole spacetime .      the next step is to do away with the bifurcation surface .",
    "one way is to consider a rindler wedge centered at an arbitrary horizon slice .",
    "however , this construction is not very well - motivated .",
    "another approach is to draw a lesson from figures [ fig : minkowski](b , c ) .",
    "there , we ve seen that as far as @xmath4 is concerned , there is no difference between a rindler wedge and an entire @xmath188 spacetime .",
    "thus , it s not really necessary to fix an origin for a rindler wedge .",
    "consider , then , some slice @xmath40 of the event horizon for some non - eternal , non - stationary black hole ( figure [ fig : local ] ) . an observer that approaches @xmath40 from large radii and then escapes to infinity must be highly accelerated .",
    "one can imagine a set of such observers spanning the horizon slice , each with a worldline that is highly accelerated in the transverse 1 + 1d plane .",
    "the observers high acceleration defines a small distance scale .",
    "therefore , one may say that they see a `` zoomed - in '' version of the surrounding spacetime .",
    "since the observers acceleration is higher than any curvature in the spacetime itself , this `` zoomed - in '' spacetime is just @xmath216 , with @xmath191 a flat 1 + 1d minkowski space . as in section",
    "[ sec : near_horizon : bifurcation ] , we can visualize the asymptotic boundary of @xmath216 as occupying a small near - horizon diamond , depicted in figure [ fig : local ] .",
    "the precise size and location of this diamond are of course ill - defined .",
    "however , these details are irrelevant for calculating @xmath4 .",
    "we again find that for small diamonds , the value of @xmath4 coincides with the black hole s",
    "entropy @xmath114 .",
    "note that this @xmath114 is the _ instantaneous _ entropy , as evaluated on the chosen horizon slice using only its intrinsic geometry .",
    "+    the accelerated observers in the above argument do not need to be rindler observers .",
    "this means that an observer s distance from the horizon ( as measured in his reference frame ) need not coincide with the inverse of his acceleration .",
    "it is in this sense that we refer to an effective @xmath216 spacetime rather than to a rindler wedge .",
    "how much of the above picture is sensitive to asymptotic infinity ? in our physical justification for the highly accelerated observers , we used the notion of `` escaping to infinity '' .",
    "therefore , the relevant horizon in the discussion is the teleological event horizon , rather than some more local structure . of course",
    ", one could choose a different , finite , hypersurface as the criterion for `` escape '' .",
    "however , such a construction would still be teleological .",
    "in contrast , the actual calculation of @xmath4 in figure [ fig : local ] is completely local .",
    "in fact , @xmath4 for _ any _ small 1 + 1d region times a codimension-2 surface @xmath40 will give the entropy functional evaluated on @xmath40 .",
    "the challenge is to incorporate this fact into some physically compelling picture .",
    "in this paper , we expanded the study of the imaginary part of the lorentzian gravitational action .",
    "the surprising results of the brute - force calculations in @xcite were explained more abstractly , through a relation with euclidean geometries .",
    "we also turned around the discussion in @xcite concerning the reality of the hamiltonian , using it to _ explain _ the dependence of @xmath4 in lovelock gravity on only the intrinsic metric of the flip surfaces .",
    "we then evaluated @xmath4 for three classes of physically interesting regions .",
    "for spacelike - bounded regions describing time evolution outside a stationary black hole ( section [ sec : gh ] ) , we found that the black hole s entropy and conserved charges enter @xmath4 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "we also found that the `` transition probability '' @xmath217 is inversely proportional to the number of microstates @xmath9 implied by the black hole s entropy .",
    "it would be interesting to see if this can be fleshed out into a more detailed physical picture .    for null - bounded `` maximal diamonds '' in various symmetric spacetimes",
    ", we found that @xmath4 coincides with the entropy that is usually associated to each spacetime .",
    "this is an intriguing pattern that calls for a deeper understanding . in particular ,",
    "it can be taken to support the notion @xcite that null boundaries are best suited for the study of quantum gravity .",
    "standard de - sitter space poses an exception to the @xmath200 pattern , which is resolved if one considers the `` elliptical '' de - sitter space ds@xmath5 instead .",
    "if one takes @xmath4 seriously as a window into quantum gravity , this may serve as yet another argument favoring ds@xmath5 over ds as the more appropriate spacetime asymptotics .    finally , we discussed regions composed of small 1 + 1d diamonds times codimension-2 surfaces @xmath40 .",
    "for all such regions , @xmath4 evaluates to the entropy as calculated from @xmath40 .",
    "we proposed a physical interpretation for this calculation in two setups : a near - bifurcation - surface region in a stationary black hole spacetime and a near - event - horizon region for a non - stationary black hole .    in the future , it would be interesting to try and relate @xmath4 to the concept of entanglement entropy , both in ads / cft @xcite and more generally in quantum field theory .    on a more fundamental note , one would like to address the conceptual issues that arise from the non - unitarity of amplitudes @xmath6 for complex @xmath0 .",
    "this may serve as a concrete starting point on the broader mystery of the physical content of quantum gravity in finite regions .",
