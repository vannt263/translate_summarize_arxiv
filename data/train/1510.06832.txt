    "the galactic center diffuse x - rays ( gcdx ) were found as a flux peak having strong emission lines around 6.7 kev with a spatial width of @xmath18 @xcite in the galactic ridge x - ray emission ( grxe ) .",
    "the emission was resolved into three lines at 6.4 , 6.7 , and 7.0 kev arising from neutral , he - like , and h - like iron @xcite , respectively .",
    "the 6.7 kev k@xmath2 line from he - like iron ( fe ) is regarded as a pure thin thermal plasma component , and its spatial distribution has been studied by @xcite .",
    "the spatial profile in the grxe region ( @xmath19 1.@xmath205 ) was well fitted by a stellar mass distribution model , but the profile in the gcdx region ( 0.@xmath202 @xmath21 1.@xmath205 ) showed fourfold excess .",
    "@xcite therefore concluded that the fe k@xmath2 line in the gcdx could not be explained in the same way as the grxe .",
    "the grxe seems to be dominated by faint x - ray point sources such as coronally active binaries ( abs ) and cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) @xcite .",
    "these sources belong to the old ( @xmath22gyr ) stellar population , and their x - ray luminosity function normalized to the stellar mass is not expected to vary significantly across the galaxy @xcite .",
    "@xcite compared the spatial profile of the fe k@xmath2 line with the stellar mass distribution of the nuclear bulge ( nb ) of the galaxy , following @xcite ; they both employed the elaborate stellar mass distribution model of the nb ( distance from the galactic center @xmath23 or @xmath24 ) by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , together with additional information about the more extended part of the galactic bulge ( gb ; @xmath25 or @xmath26 ) and disk @xcite .",
    "the nb model is an empirical 3-d axisymmetric model consisting of a spherical nuclear stellar cluster and a nuclear stellar disk .",
    "it is mainly based on the cobe 4.9@xmath27 m surface brightness map with an angular resolution of 0.@xmath207 . since the nb is unresolved in galactic latitude , the scale height of warm dust derived from iras data",
    "was substituted for the stellar disk .",
    "@xcite and @xcite in turn integrated the nb ( and gb ) model along the line of sight toward the galactic center while tuning the relative weight of each component , and compared these model surface densities with the observed surface density of the fe k@xmath2 line .",
    "@xcite , however , estimated the overall uncertainty in building this model to be as large as 50% .    here",
    "we take another approach to this problem : directly comparing the observed surface density of the fe k@xmath2 line with the observed ( and extinction - corrected ) stellar number density @xmath28 in the @xmath1 band , without making use of of any models for the nb or gb . since the nb and gb are highly concentrated7 percent stars along the line of sight @xmath29 are located at a distance of 7.5kpc or less from the sun . ] toward the galactic center , the line of sight depth can be neglected , to 0th order . therefore",
    ", all the stars , as well as the fe k@xmath2 emission , can be considered to be located at a distance of 8kpc .",
    "then the absolute magnitude @xmath30 and extinction - corrected apparent magnitude @xmath31 of stars are related simply by @xmath32 , where 14.52 is the distance modulus .",
    "we aim to probe the ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) distribution of the old population to which the faint x - ray point sources belong , by counting stars more luminous than @xmath30 or , equivalently , brighter than the apparent magnitude @xmath31 . as a first assumption ,",
    "if we set the limiting magnitude to be reasonably faint , we will be able to detect a representative old red giant population and the derived ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) distribution @xmath7 should be similar to that of faint x - ray point sources .",
    "the earliest and faintest m giants have @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "we thus require a corresponding limiting magnitude of @xmath31 @xmath3410.4 .",
    "if we can not set the limiting magnitude faint enough , we will end up detecting only supergiants and other younger stars , whose spatial distribution can be very different . in this _ paper _ , employing large - scale near - infrared survey data with faint limiting magnitudes , we derive the number density map of stars to the extinction - corrected magnitude @xmath31 deep enough to detect the old red giant population , and estimate the ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) distribution of faint x - ray point sources .",
    "the central region of our galaxy @xmath35 @xmath36 and @xmath4 ( equivalent to 0.8kpc @xmath5 0.3kpc for @xmath6kpc ) was observed @xcite using the near - infrared camera sirius ( simultaneous infrared imager for unbiased survey ; @xcite ) on the 1.4 m irsf telescope .",
    "the sirius camera provides @xmath37 ( 1.25@xmath27 m ) , @xmath0 ( 1.63@xmath27 m ) , and @xmath1 ( 2.14@xmath27 m ) images simultaneously , with a field of view of 7@xmath38.7 @xmath5 7@xmath38.7 and a pixel scale of 0@xmath39.45 .",
    "the typical seeing was 1@xmath39.2 fwhm , and the averages of the 10-@xmath40 limiting magnitudes were @xmath37 = 17.1 , @xmath0 = 16.6 , and @xmath1 = 15.6 .",
    "we will employ only the @xmath0 and @xmath1 data because of heavy extinction toward the galactic center .",
    "we choose stars near the galactic center , and derive their extinction - free magnitudes from @xmath41 vs @xmath1 color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) .",
    "three by three fields of view were treated as one region of 20@xmath38 @xmath5 20@xmath38 .",
    "figure [ fig : cmd ] is the cmd of a region centered at @xmath42 , shown as an example .",
    "estimates based on a simple model @xcite show that the majority of detected stars are near the galactic center and reddened to the color corresponding to @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , the stars near the galactic center are selected by eye in the cmds , and then their @xmath1 magnitudes were corrected for extinction .",
    "the threshold of @xmath41 was 0.7 for the region shown in figure 1 , and was in the range of @xmath44 for each region of the whole observation .",
    "the average intrinsic color @xmath45 of the detected stars on the basis of calculations , considering the limiting magnitudes and using the @xcite model , is 0.203 ; its standard deviation is quite small because the intrinsic color @xmath45 of stars is 0.0 for the bluest ( rare ob stars ) and 0.4 for the reddest ( rare late m giants ) .",
    "therefore , we regard the intrinsic color @xmath45 of all stars as 0.203 , and corrected their @xmath1 magnitudes according to the reddening law by @xcite @xmath46 $ ] ; see the arrow in figure [ fig : cmd ] .",
    "thus we obtain the line - of - sight extinction @xmath47 and extinction - corrected magnitude @xmath31 of each star .",
    "( 80mm,100mm)color - mag_contour_gc1742 - 2900_rv_thesis.eps    there has been considerable work carried out on the near - ir extinction in the galactic bulge .",
    "some of the work indicates that the wavelength dependence of near - ir extinction varies sufficiently from one line of sight to another that the use of a single extinction law can lead to an incorrect stellar distribution .",
    "@xcite derived @xmath48-band extinction laws as a function of two colors of ( @xmath49 ) and ( @xmath50 ) , and concluded that the conversion from reddening to extinction can not be done accurately with a single law .",
    "@xcite found large variations in extinction over angular scales as small as @xmath51 .",
    "furthermore , they found ` grayer ' extinction coefficient @xmath52 toward the inner galaxy , where @xmath53 is the spitzer irac bands of 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0@xmath27 m",
    ". we have checked the impact of such a variation , assuming that the @xmath0-band extinction coefficient changes as much as the 3.6@xmath27 m coefficient . while the _ variation _ in @xmath54 over the central several degrees of longitude seems one percent at most ( see their fig.24(a ) ) , this variation affects the dereddening procedure and leads to a several percent change in the number count .",
    "thus we should be careful if we discuss more subtle differences .",
    "we set the limiting magnitude @xmath8 , and plotted the stellar number density profile @xmath12 .",
    "this corresponds to the absolute magnitude of @xmath55 , which includes all m - type giants at the galactic center .",
    "they are numerous enough ( nearly two orders of magnitude more than young supergiants in the @xcite model ) to probe the old stellar population , and we therefore assume that @xmath12 traces adequately the spatial distribution of faint x - ray point sources .",
    "in fact , @xcite use a synthetic cmd computation @xcite to estimate the fraction of the stars brighter than @xmath8 for several different models of star forming history ; they found that these bright stars trace the spatial distribution of the faint old stars very well , even in a conservative case .",
    "( 8cm,8cm)star_map_kaikai.eps    since our 10-@xmath40 limiting magnitudes are @xmath56 and the extinction is @xmath57mag even for the galactic center itself ( * ? ? ?",
    "* the 40@xmath39 @xmath5 40@xmath39 region around sgra@xmath58 ) , we can assume that our star list is nearly complete to the extinction - corrected magnitude @xmath8 over almost all the regions near the galactic center .",
    "first , we examine this assumption .",
    "we construct an extinction - free map of the stellar number density @xmath12 with a 1@xmath38 resolution in figure [ fig : map](a ) . using these bright stars of @xmath59",
    ", we can estimate the average extinction towards these stars at a resolution of 1@xmath38 as well . we can check if the extinction derived in this way is consistent with the extinction @xmath60 derived from spitzer / irac observation between 3.6 and 8.0@xmath27 m @xcite . since the spitzer / irac extinction values were derived from longer wavelength observations , they tend to represent the line - of - sight extinction to the galactic center better in more reddened regions .",
    "the comparison of these extinction values in figure [ fig : aks ] indicates that our estimates agree very well with those from spitzer / irac up to the extinction of @xmath61 . in some of the more reddened regions , however , our extinction is smaller than spitzer / irac",
    ". therefore , we mark the map pixels whose @xmath62 by gray squares in figure [ fig : map](b ) .",
    "figure [ fig : map](b ) has another type of squares : the black squares are the 2@xmath38 @xmath5 2@xmath38 regions ( four pixels combined ) where our stellar distribution evidently decreases from the adjacent regions . to select these pixels",
    ", we have calculated the running mean of the stellar density in 15 regions of 2@xmath38 @xmath5 2@xmath38 in @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "these lines of sight might suffer so great an extinction that even @xmath60 might have been underestimated .",
    "these two types of pixels tend to increase toward the central region , and this leads to underestimation of the stellar number density in the central region .",
    "the masked pixels were removed from further analysis , which amount to 18 percent of the area of figure [ fig : map](b ) .",
    "( 6cm,12cm)irsf_schultheis_kai.eps    second , we estimate the effect of confusion on finding stars .",
    "the stellar density increases by a factor of @xmath63 from the outer part of our data to the central @xmath64 .",
    "we computed the completeness of finding stars over the entire field .",
    "we added artificial sources of @xmath65 to the sirius images , and examined the recovery rate of these sources ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is generally quite high @xmath66 in the outer part , but drops to @xmath67 in the center .",
    "therefore , the stellar number density is slightly underestimated in the central part , and this distorts the profile slightly .",
    "we will correct for these completeness changes in the analysis in the next section .    to check further",
    "whether the stellar number density @xmath12 is not severely underestimated in the central part of our map , we constructed the number density @xmath68 of stars brighter than @xmath69 because brighter stars are less affected by confusion and extinction problems , which generally increases toward the center .",
    "we test if @xmath12 and @xmath68 show similar profiles . in the outer part ,",
    "the two generally agree within the poisson errors , although @xmath68 is sometimes too small to make any meaningful comparison . in the central part ,",
    "we calculate the averages of @xmath70 in the four 20@xmath38 @xmath5 20@xmath38 regions adjacent to the central 20@xmath38 @xmath5 20@xmath38 region .",

    "] , when we multiply @xmath68 by this ratio , the results are greater than @xmath12 by factors @xmath72 .",
    "the mean of these factors is 1.21 , i.e. , greater than 1.00 ; this could be due to 1 ) the extinction or confusion mentioned above , or 2 ) actual change in the bright - to - faint star ratio .",
    "the latter is possible if the central part of nb contains younger stars which are often more luminous .",
    "if we were affected by this effect , then we would overestimate the point - source - originated fe k@xmath2 emission from @xmath68 in the central region .",
    "however , we would certainly be able to determine reliable upper limits .",
    "therefore , we will use these corrected @xmath12 , derived from @xmath68 , in the central 20@xmath38 region in the next section .",
    "the stellar number density distribution is compared with that of the fe k@xmath2 line obtained with the x - ray imaging spectrometer onboard the suzaku satellite reported in @xcite .",
    "we will use the new coordinates whose origin is at sgr a@xmath58 , @xmath73 , following @xcite .",
    "the fe k@xmath2 intensity shows several tens of percent excess on the positive @xmath74 side ( east ) in comparison with the negative side ( west ) near the center @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "this asymmetry was also pointed out in the number of x - ray stars by @xcite .",
    "they suggest that the excess is due to young massive stars associated with the high activity of star formation in the positive @xmath74 part .",
    "in contrast , our measurement of the near - infrared stellar number density shows no significant asymmetry , as shown in figure [ fig : lprof](b ) .",
    "here we compare the fe k@xmath2 intensity and the near - infrared stellar number density on the negative @xmath74 side where the former increases towards the center at a slower rate .",
    "the number density @xmath76 in the same rectangular bins as @xcite , @xmath77 for the longitude distribution is plotted in figure [ fig : lprof](a ) , and @xmath78 for the latitude distribution , is in figure [ fig : lprof](b ) .",
    "the center of each rectangle is given as @xmath79 along the longitude , and @xmath80 along the latitude , where @xmath81 is a non - zero integer .",
    "the number density in each rectangular bin corresponds to the average in the unmasked @xmath82 pixels shown in figure [ fig : map](b ) , and the averaged location of them is also calculated for that specified rectangle . in figure",
    "[ fig : lprof](a ) and ( b ) , we normalize the stellar number density so that the ordinates agree in the grxe region @xmath83 , where @xcite found that the fe k@xmath2 line intensity can be explained by x - ray point sources .",
    "the fe k@xmath2 line intensity shows significant excess in comparison with the stellar number density in the central region , and the excess increases as we approach the center .",
    "the excess is @xmath84 at @xmath85 , and reaches @xmath86 at @xmath87 when normalized in the galactic ridge .",

    "the difference in these indices are independent of the region we choose for the normalization .",
    "therefore , the fe k@xmath2 line is likely to originate from emitters with different spatial distribution from the old population .",
    "our excess estimate is @xmath93 at @xmath87 , but @xcite concluded that the emissivity in the nb must be higher by a factor of @xmath94 than that in the grxe when fitted with stellar mass distribution models .",
    "if we look at their fig . 4 ( similarly the lower - right panel of fig . 7 of @xcite ) , the stellar mass distribution curve based mainly on @xcite seems to be very flat compared with the fe k@xmath2 distribution , especially in the range of @xmath95 .",
    "the stellar mass model assumes a nuclear stellar disk whose radius is about 150pc , and the projected surface density is rather flat .",
    "in contrast , our stellar number density increases gradually toward the center .",
    "its increase from @xmath96 to @xmath97 is about 1.4 times that of the flatter mass model by @xcite .",
    "this difference in the stellar number density profile likely explains part of the large emissivity difference derived from our analysis and that of @xcite .",

    "( data by @xcite ) .",
    "this leads to slightly smaller value in the current estimate than 3.8 in @xcite .",
    "another remarkable feature of figure [ fig : lprof](a ) is the apparent change in these slopes around @xmath100 both in @xmath88 and the fe k@xmath2 line intensity . within this galactic longitude",
    ", the nuclear disk component is dominant in the stellar mass distribution model of the nb @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the fe k@xmath2 line excess is related to the nuclear disk , and more concentrated to the center than its usual stellar component .",
    "finally , we discuss the possible systematic errors of the measured stellar number density .",
    "although we corrected for the change in star - finding completeness and adopted the larger @xmath88 derived from brighter stars of @xmath101 , the data point at @xmath87 shows a slight downward shift from the straight line in figure [ fig : lprof](a ) . to be conservative , we tried fitting without this data point , and obtained @xmath102 as the index of stellar number density distribution .",
    "when the point at @xmath87 is excluded , the index of the fe k@xmath2 distribution is @xmath103 .",
    "thus even with these exclusions , the slopes seem to be different .",
    "thus , the diffuse x - ray emission characterized by the fe k@xmath2 lines in the range of @xmath104 3.@xmath200 and @xmath105 1.@xmath200 most likely arises from 1 ) a point - source component which is detected as old red giants in our infrared survey and extends to the outer part of the gb , and 2 ) a more concentrated component which becomes prominent inside @xmath106 0.@xmath208 .",
    "the second component might be related to the nb of the galaxy , where active star formation takes place ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "supernova explosions of newly born stars might be able to provide hot plasma , but the confinement of such plasma is another difficult problem , which was discussed in @xcite .",
    "direct comparison of the observed surface density of the fe k@xmath2 line with the extinction - corrected stellar number density observed in the @xmath1 band yields different power - law indices @xmath92 and @xmath89 , respectively , in the range of @xmath91 .",
    "the fe k@xmath2 line intensity shows significant excess in comparison with the stellar number density in the central region : @xmath84 at @xmath85 , and reaches @xmath86 at @xmath87 when normalized in the galactic ridge .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the diffuse x - ray emission in the galactic center region can not be explained solely by a population of unresolved point - sources that is related to the old stellar population .",
