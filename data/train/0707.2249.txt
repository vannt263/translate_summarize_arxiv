    "clusters of galaxies represent the most massive bound systems in the cosmos .",
    "although they result from non - linear structure evolution , the departure from linear growth is modest compared to that for less massive objects . as a result",
    ", simple analytic models can provide an accurate indication of their expected number density at various redshifts .",
    "this is the primary reason why cluster of galaxies are considered to be valuable cosmological probes .",
    "cosmological attention has focused on the redshift - dependent number of clusters , @xmath1 , whose mass exceeds a certain threshold .",
    "this is one of the most straightforward observables , and is a function of the cluster mass function , @xmath2 , and the evolution of comoving volume @xmath3 .",
    "the mass function is obtained from the growth rate of density fluctuations , @xmath4 , numerically @xcite under the assumption of a particular theory of structure formation , e.g. the currently - popular cold dark matter ( cdm ) model . since",
    "both @xmath4 and @xmath3 are dependent on the cosmological model , useful constraints could be estimated by comparing @xmath1 with various model predictions . to make progress , e.g. on the dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath5 , data on several thousand clusters to @xmath61",
    "is thought to be required @xcite , and maintaining an accurate and uniform mass threshold is critical .",
    "most early work focused on selecting clusters optically , with detection techniques that have improved over the decades : e.g. matched - filter @xcite , red - sequence @xcite , cut - and - enhance @xcite .",
    "optically selected samples have traditionally suffered from uncertainties in the optical richness - mass relation , although there has been recent progress in calibrating the closely related richness - velocity dispersion relation using the large maxbcg sample of clusters identified in the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "so far , x - ray samples have been the most popular cosmological probes e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "luminosity ( @xmath7 ) or temperature ( @xmath8)-limited samples offer simpler selection functions because the observables , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , are a fair estimate of the cluster mass , calibrated through empirical scaling relations .",
    "the derived mass does depend , however , on the assumed dynamical state of the system .",
    "unrelaxed clusters , arising for example from recent mergers , will introduce scatter in the scaling relation .",
    "a recent study by @xcite points out that at least half of 10 z @xmath9 0.2 cluster cores show unrelaxed features and a scatter of @xmath10 around the mean scaling relation .",
    "weak gravitational lensing , which analyses the coherent shear pattern of background galaxies , can potentially provide estimates of the cluster mass _ regardless of its dynamical state or the properties of the constituent galaxies_. for some years , the method has been used to calibrate mass obtained from x - ray data @xcite .",
    "@xcite concluded that x - ray mass measurements are consistent with those from weak lensing , particularly for relaxed systems which thus offer a useful cosmological probe@xcite .",
    "a natural extension of this progress is thus to consider selecting clusters directly from weak lensing signals .",
    "the development of panoramic imaging surveys has now made this a practical proposition .",
    "@xcite reported the first discovery of a cluster located from a weak lensing convergence map , during the course of conducting the deep lens survey @xcite .",
    "@xcite later undertook a systematic search of mass concentrations on a 2 deg@xmath0 field using the suprime - cam imager on subaru .",
    "they detected several significant ( s / n@xmath11 ) candidates , one of which was later spectroscopically identified as a cluster at @xmath12 = 0.41 .",
    "@xcite investigated 50 randomly - selected vlt fors1 fields , spanning 0.64 deg@xmath0 in total , and found 5 shear - selected candidates , each associated with an overdensity in luminosity .",
    "the first results from the deep lens survey , based on an area of 8.6 deg@xmath0 have also recently emerged @xcite .",
    "the above pioneering studies have demonstrated that clusters can be located directly via weak lensing .",
    "however , key issues , including the optimum selection threshold , the rate of spurious detection and the degree of mass completeness at a given redshift , crucial for any eventual cosmological application , remain unresolved .    at the present time , theoretical studies offer the only insight into these issues .",
    "projection is one of the most troublesome aspects of a weak lensing survey , because of the relatively broad window function .",
    "unrelated structures contributing to the signal would lead to an overestimate of the cluster mass . moreover , as the noise in the convergence map arises largely from shot noise in the ellipticity distribution of background galaxies , some fraction of genuine clusters might be missed in a shear selected catalog .",
    "n - body and ray - tracing simulations @xcite have concluded that , for systems whose convergence signal lie above a 4 standard deviation ( @xmath13 ) threshold , 60 - 75% of clusters can reliably recovered ( completeness ) .",
    "likewise , for peaks detected in the simulated data using typically - used algorithms , 60 - 75 % represent genuine clusters ( efficiency ) .",
    "the difference in these figures between the various studies is largely due to differences in the lower mass limit adopted in the studies .",
    "this series of papers is motivated by the need to address these key issues observationally .",
    "the survey we describe is a natural and ongoing extension of the 2 deg@xmath0 survey of @xcite ; to date a total field of 21.82 deg@xmath0 has been imaged .",
    "this first paper describes the imaging survey and discusses the validation of the candidates found , both via spectroscopic verification and comparison with clusters located via x - ray techniques .",
    "later papers in the series will extend the spectroscopic follow - up to the full sample and will consider the feasibility of deriving cosmological constraints from both this survey and future enhanced versions .",
    "we note that a similary motivated program has been initiated by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , all of which made used of the imaging data taken by 2.5 m vlt survey telescope .",
    "we compare the their conclusions with our own in this paper .",
    "we note that a similarly motivated program has been initiated by @xcite and @xcite whose conclusions we compare with our own in this paper .    a plan of the paper follows .",
    "we discuss the imaging strategy and data analysis in  2 , including construction of the cluster catalog and its reliability . in  3 , we describe our initial spectroscopic follow - up with subaru and address the completeness by comparing x - ray selected clusters on one of our survey area where relevant x - ray data is available .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in  4 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in order to evaluate the efficiency of our weak lensing survey for locating cluster halos , we considered that a comparison with a sample of x - ray selected clusters would be highly advantageous @xcite .",
    "therefore , our survey fields were primarily selected to contain x - ray data as shown in table  [ tab : survey_field ] .",
    "we set a minimum rosat exposure time , @xmath14 , of 25 ksec ensuring a detection limit of @xmath15erg / s at @xmath60.5 ( for @xmath16,@xmath17 , @xmath18 ) .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath19 , which is well matched to the likely mass detection limit of our weak lensing survey @xcite .",
    "more sensitive x - ray missions , xmm - newton and chandra , have been surveying rosat fields , in part , to deeper limits . these include the `` lynx '' , `` lockman hole '' and `` uk 13 hr deep field '' in our target list .",
    "xmm is also actively involved in international campaigns of multi - wavelength wide field ( @xmath20 ) observations such as the `` cosmos '' , `` xmm - lss '' and `` sxds '' fields which we also included . among these ,",
    "the xmm - lss field @xcite is of particular interest given its panoramic area and published cluster catalogs @xcite .",
    "finally , we included the deimos deep2 survey fields @xcite where spectra of @xmath9 50,000 faint galaxies will eventually become available .",
    "this will enable close correlations of lensing mass and various measures of the luminosity density as was recently pioneered for the cosmos field @xcite .",
    "although x - ray data is not available for these deep fields at the current time , such observations are planned and will likely become available soon .",
    "the imaging observations were largely carried out on may 1 - 4 and september 27 , 2003 as part of an `` intensive program '' of subaru telescope .",
    "the lynx field was observed on january 29 - 30 , 2003 , sxds data was obtained from the public archive and the cosmos field observed on february 18 and 21 , 2004 .",
    "the suprime - cam field size is 0.25 deg@xmath0 and all observations were conducted with the @xmath21 filter ( except the cosmos field which was observed in @xmath22-band to enable direct comparison with acs@xmath23hst s f814w images ) .",
    "the total exposure time was 30 minutes for each pointing , taken via four 7.5 minute exposures in a dither pattern of spacing @xmath9 1 arcmin .",
    "[ fig : fwhmee ] ( top ) shows the seeing ( fwhm ) of each 7.5 minute exposure over a typical five night observing sequence .",
    "the bottom panel shows ellipticities of moderately bright unsaturated stars which provide a measure of the psf anisotropy ; the raw ellipticity is mostly 2 - 4 % ( and occasionally @xmath24 5 % ) .",
    "we discuss the question of the psf anisotropy in appendix  [ sec : imagequality ] .",
    "thus far , we have surveyed over 21.82 deg@xmath0 as summarized in table  [ tab : survey_field ] .",
    "the useful field area excludes the surroundings of bright stars and galaxies and field boundaries .",
    "individual pointings whose seeing was worse than 0.9 arcsec were also excluded ; this occurred for only 5 % of the clear time ( see section  [ sec : wlana ] ) .",
    "the data reduction procedures for the present survey closely followed those described in section 3.1 of @xcite , enhanced as discussed below .",
    "normally , with suprime - cam images , each ccd exposure is `` mosaic - stacked '' to yield a single image of a particular pointing .",
    "a simple geometrical model is used for the focal plane astrometry whose parameters include the effects of camera distortion , the displacement and rotation of each detector from a defined fiducial location and the offset and the rotation of the dithered exposures .",
    "the best fit parameters are obtained by minimizing the positional difference of control stars ( 70@xmath9100 stars per ccd ) held common for each exposure . the residual alignment error in this procedure is @xmath9 0.5 pixel rms ( 0.1 arcsec rms ) .",
    "such a residual is sufficiently small for most imaging applications .",
    "however , in seeing better than 0.6 arcsec ( fwhm ) , a misalignment of 0.1 arcsec between two images introduces a @xmath252 % ellipticity on the stacked image which is a serious issue for weak lensing studies .",
    "a further improvement is thus necessary .",
    "the residual @xmath26 from a reference frame is parameterized as a polynomial function of field position @xmath27 as :    @xmath28    pixel values are estimated via linear interpolation of neighboring four pixels .",
    "the coefficients @xmath29 and @xmath30 are then obtained by minimizing the variance of the residuals .",
    "a sixth order polynomial is usually sufficient for this purpose .",
    "each individual ccd image is ` warped ' using this polynomial correction prior to stacking .",
    "this process reduces the alignment error to @xmath9 0.07 pixel ( 0.014 arcsec ) and is similar to the `` jelly ccd '' model described in @xcite .",
    "although an external stellar catalog would ideally be used for accurate astrometry , no such data is available at the relevant faint limits ( r @xmath24 22 ) .",
    "we therefore employ the first exposure , corrected by the simple geometrical model discussed above , as the basic reference frame .",
    "we noticed that this refined procedure still introduces some artificial deformation .",
    "[ fig : warp](a ) represents the raw image of one ccd whereas fig .",
    "[ fig : warp](b ) is that slightly rotated by @xmath31 rad , a typical value , using the mapping described above . clearly some degree of artificial deformation is introduced .",
    "after some experimentation , we found this deformation arises from the undersampled nature of the suprime - cam images . by adopting 2@xmath322",
    "oversampling prior to rotation , the resulting ellipticity field shows no sign of image deformation .",
    "however , this is a computationally a very time - consuming solution .    accordingly , in our final analysis , instead of using oversampled images , we modified the mapping procedure itself .",
    "we estimate the pixel values of the target images from 3rd order bi - linear polynomial interpolation of 4@xmath324 source pixels rather than the linear interpolation four neighboring pixels in the previous procedure .",
    "this mapping process avoids introducing image deformation and is significantly quicker computationally .",
    "object finding and shape measurement was executed on the mosaic - stacked images using the _ imcat _ software suite developed by nick kaiser . a threshold _",
    "nu_=10 was adopted .",
    "photometric calibration used landolt standard stars @xcite and the faint standards of @xcite .",
    "we adopt the vega magnitude system in the following .",
    "galaxies are distinguished from stars via their half light radius , @xmath33 , viz :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the half light radius of a stellar image and its rms respectively .",

    "[ fig : seeing_gdens_pgamma](a ) ) .",
    "table  [ tab : survey_field ] lists the seeing and the galaxy density for each field .    finally , we masked all objects close to bright stars ( within 18 arcsec for @xmath39 , 90 arcsec for @xmath40 ) .",
    "light halos around bright stars can introduce spurious galaxies .",
    "object shapes are represented by the ellipticities , @xmath41 where @xmath42 are gaussian - weighted quadrupole moments of the surface brightness distribution .",
    "the point spread function ( psf ) of the images is usually smeared by various instrumental effects such as optical aberrations and the tracking error of the telescope .",
    "the psf anisotropy is estimated based on images of stars , and the galaxy images are corrected so that images of neighboring stars are re - circularized .",
    "galaxy ellipticities are then corrected as :    @xmath43    where the asterisk designates a stellar value , @xmath44 is the smear polarisability tensor and is mostly diagonal @xcite .",

    "this correction is carried out independently on each pointing .",
    "we further justify the correction procedure in appendix [ sec : imagequality ] .",
    "the shear induced by gravitational lensing , @xmath46 , is diluted by atmospheric seeing .",
    "@xcite developed a prescription to convert the observed ellipticities to a pre - seeing shear as    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the pre - seeing shear polarisability tensor defined as    @xmath49    @xmath50 is the shear polarisability tensor defined in @xcite , and @xmath51 is the stellar shear polarisability tensor .",

    "@xmath52 decreases slightly as the seeing worsens but the change is not very large ( 0.4 to 0.3 ) .",

    "the ellipticities observed by suprime - cam are in fact diluted by 36 % compared with those of acs , which is consistent with fig  [ fig : seeing_gdens_pgamma](b ) .    to calculate @xmath48 as a function of position we employed a `` smoothing '' scheme @xcite .",

    "more sophisticated methods have since been developed and the variants are summarized by @xcite . in their notation ,",
    "our method is very similar to the procedure termed `` lv '' .",
    "based on the results of the step simulation study , @xcite concluded that both the `` ksb+ '' method , modified by @xcite and implementations of `` bj02 '' method @xcite are able to reconstruct input shears to a few percent level . to calibrate our method",

    "for the model designated `` psf3 '' , we underestimate the input shear by 5% for @xmath62 = 0.1 and 0.05 , whereas for @xmath63 , the difference , @xmath64 is insignificant .",
    "an error of 5 % in the recovered shear is competitive with most of the methods discussed by @xcite ( @xmath9 7 % is a typical error ) .",

    "we repeated this randomization 100 times and computed the rms value at each grid point where @xmath70 is computed . assuming the @xmath70 error distribution is gaussian",
    ", this rms represents the 1-@xmath13 noise level , and thus the measured signal divided by the rms gives the signal / noise ratio , @xmath73 , of the @xmath70 map at that point .    the gaussian - smoothed signal / noise map",
    "is then searched for mass concentrations .",
    "@xcite concluded that a truncated nfw filter applied to the aperture mass map , @xmath74 , is the most efficient detection technique .",
    "such optimization may be necessary to improve the efficiency of future very wide field surveys where thousands of clusters are sought .",

    "while visually inspecting galaxy concentrations around the detected halos , we noticed that less concentrated halos tend to occur preferentially near bright stars and field boundaries .",
    "since regions near bright stars are masked ( section [ sec : galaxycatalogs ] ) conceivably the discontinuity in the faint background galaxy distribution could cause spurious peaks . to avoid this , we reject halos occurring within a 4 arcmin radius of bright stars ( @xmath76 @xmath77 11 ) and within 2.3 arcmin of the field boundary .",
    "these restrictions reduce the survey area by 23 % to what we will refer to as the _ secure survey area _",
    "( 16.72 deg@xmath0 ) .",
    "halos found within the secure area are termed the _",
    "secure sample_. it is certainly possible that a significant fraction of halos lying in the non - secure area are genuine clusters .",
    "we will discuss this further in a later paper concerned with their spectroscopic follow - up ( green et al , in preparation ) .",
    "detailed inspection of the halo candidates and the spectroscopic follow - up discussed below revealed our completeness is high to a limiting signal to noise in the convergence map of 3.69 .",

    "concerning the optimum threshold for the significance , decreasing it will increase the halo sample but likely introduce more false detections .",
    "the optimum value should be set based on the spectroscopically - observed true / false rate .",
    "investigating the rate is a major goal of our study . in this work ,",
    "the least significant spectroscopically - identified halos have s / n = 3.69 ( xmm - wide n=23 ) .",
    "we adopted the threshold of 3.69 for this work so that all the spectroscopically followed - up samples are included in the table .",
    "we adopted significance maps for the selection of candidates rather than kappa maps .",
    "this is because we would like to minimize contamination by the false peaks .",
    "however , the effective kappa threshold varies over the field , so we may encounter a `` completeness '' problem ; i.e. halos that have high kappa value are lost from the list .",
    "we investigated such omissions in the xmm - wide field ( figure  [ fig : saclay_halomap ] ) , and only one halo is found in this category , with @xmath80 & @xmath81 where the @xmath82 is calculated as @xmath83 .",
    "the `` @xmath84 '' is estimated globally over the entire xmm - wide field kappa map , and is 0.018 here .",
    "this halo is lost because the local noise is as high as 0.022 .    in practice",
    ", it will be very hard to generate completely uniform data sets over the entire field of a survey because weather and seeing conditions will vary . we will have to optimize the @xmath82 on a field by field basis based on the data quality of each field .",
    "therefore , our strategy is the following : at first , we collect reliable cluster samples based on the significance , and then users of the catalog can set their own kappa threshold or mass threshold to carry out their studies .",
    "this work represents the results of the first step above .",

    "figure  [ fig : seeingdens ] shows the halo density of our thirteen survey fields .",
    "the horizontal axis shows the density of faint galaxies ( @xmath87 ) used for weak lensing analysis .",
    "the error bars are based only on @xmath88 estimates and do not include the effects of cosmic variance .",
    "solid lines in figure  [ fig : seeingdens ] show the prediction of the simulation where three different mean redshifts for the background galaxies are assumed ( from bottom to top : 0.8 , 1.0 and 1.2 ) .    although the scatter is large , there is reasonable agreement between the observations and the prediction .",
    "we also see a gradual increase of the observed number density over the @xmath87 range sampled as expected .",
    "these comparisons validate our observational procedures .",
    "we have , however , two outliers in figure  [ fig : seeingdens ] . these could be caused by cosmic variance or may arise from some other reasons .",
    "further follow - up studies will be important to clarify the issue .",
    "armed with the shear - selected halo catalog , we now discuss the tests we have made to verify its reliability , using both spectroscopic observations and comparisons with x - ray data in the fields where the overlap of targets can be studied .",
    "because the lensing kernel ( or window function ) has a relatively broad redshift range , the superposition of multiple low mass halos with different redshifts could yield highly significant weak lensing signals .",
    "such ` superposition halos ' are unwelcome in a mass - selected cluster catalog . in order to identify such superposition halos we undertook a more comprehensive spectroscopic survey using a multi - object spectrograph for selected candidates .",
    "this also gives us the velocity dispersion of member galaxies , which is an estimate of dynamical mass of clusters . by comparing dynamical mass with weak lensing mass",
    "we will be able to discuss the dynamical state of the clusters ( hamana et al . in preparation ) .",
    "we used the focas spectrograph on subaru whose multi - object mode permits the simultaneous observation of 25 - 30 galaxies in the field of a particular halo .",
    "we used the 150/mm grating and a sy47 order sorting filter .",
    "this configuration spans the wavelength range @xmath89  @xcite .",
    "target selection was based primarily on apparent magnitude and the color information was used when available .",
    "the exposure time was 45 @xmath9 70 minutes depending on the magnitude of the selected galaxies and the observing conditions .",
    "the spectroscopic data was reduced using standard iraf procedures ( hamana et al . in preparation ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : focasobs ] shows a typical focas observation where the target is identified as a @xmath12 = 0.6 cluster .",
    "since may 2004 we have observed 26 halos from the secure sample with focas .",
    "higher priority was given to more significant halos , except in the early stages of program ( for example in the lynx and pg1159 - 035 fields ) when the follow - up strategy was still being evaluated .",
    "each of the 26 halos has been reliably identified with a cluster of galaxies .",
    "the redshift so determined is shown in the column labeled `` focas '' of table  [ tab : halocat],[tab : halocat2 ] .    in parallel with the focas follow - up ,",
    "long slit observations with keck / lris have been carried out to enlarge the sample of redshifts as quickly as possible .",
    "we have to keep in mind that this method can not discriminate the projected samples , and some statistical consideration is necessary in dealing with the data for further studies .",
    "a complete discussion of that aspect of our program is discussed in a separate paper ( green et al , in prep . ) . in the `` note '' column of table  [ tab : halocat],[tab : halocat2 ] , we list the preliminary keck / lris results as `` lris z = zvalue '' whose identification is already robust ( e.g. at least two galaxy redshifts agree ) including one of the halos in the xmm - wide field ( sl j0222.3 - 0446 , @xmath12=0.41 ) where we discuss the reliability of our catalog ( see section [ sec : reliability ] ) .",
    "in addition to undertaking our own spectroscopic observations , we also searched the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) for clusters and groups with published redshifts close to the position of our detected halos .",
    "we included recently - published cluster catalogs in the xmm - wide survey by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ( * vwp * data hereafter ) . in making assignments , we considered a cluster to be associated with a halo if the angular separation was less than 2 arcmin and the 3 dimensional distance less than 1 @xmath90 mpc .",
    "13 out of 100 halos can be identified in this way with rich clusters in the literature and the published redshift is shown in the column labeled `` known '' of table  [ tab : halocat],[tab : halocat2 ] .",
    "three of these thirteen clusters were also observed by focas in multi - object mode and we note that the mean focas redshift is different from the published value for these systems ( @xmath91 ) . these discrepancies can be explained by the fact that ned redshift of these clusters are all photometric , which have larger uncertainties .",
    "therefore , we adopted the focas redshifts for these three cases .",
    "we searched the ned galaxy group catalog in the same manner , but no group matched any of our halos .",
    "next , we searched for individual galaxies with published redshifts within 3 arcmin of our halos . if suitable data was found , we grouped them together using a `` friend of friend '' algorithm with a linking length of 1 @xmath90 mpc . if we found a clustering of more than two members , we calculated the average redshift and the mean astrometric position .",
    "using the same proximity criterion above , we assigned a redshift to 14 further halos .",
    "these are shown in the column labeled `` nedg '' .    in order to estimate the probability of a chance coincidence of the matching procedures , we first randomized the position of the detected halos in the field , and applied the same matching procedure described above to the randomized halo catalog .",
    "this process suggests that the probability of a chance coincidence is roughly 10 % and 25 % for the cluster and galaxy clustering searches , respectively .",
    "clearly care should be taken in analyzing such data .",
    "the total number of reliably identified clusters are 41 ( out of 100 in table  [ tab : halocat],[tab : halocat2 ] ) where we do not include those identified by `` nedg '' galaxies because the chance coincidence is not negligible .",
    "we assign i d labels only for these reliable halos in the tables .",
    "we now turn to the important question of the evaluating the reliability of our shear - selected catalog .",
    "we will do this by examining both the success rate of our identifications and by comparing with x - ray samples obtained via the xmm - wide field survey .",
    "vwp have confirmed spectroscopic redshifts for 28 x - ray selected clusters in the 3.5 deg@xmath0 survey field .",
    "their locations are plotted as squares on figure  [ fig : saclay_halomap ] .",
    "our secure sample of 15 shear - selected halos with s / n @xmath24 3.69 is plotted as solid circles .",
    "those we have spectroscopically confirmed using subaru s focas and/or keck lris are marked by large open circles .",
    "we find that three halos ( 1 , 16 and 23 ) are confirmed as clusters by focas and are not reported in vwp .",
    "among our 15 shear - selected halo samples , only three ( 4 , 10 and 20 ) have yet to be identified .",
    "this identification success rate ( 80 % ) can be regarded as a lower limit given future observations may yet locate an associated cluster . although affected by small number statistics , this minimum efficiency is already higher than expected by simulation studies@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to compare our identification success rate with those found in the _ gabods _ survey .",
    "@xcite found 14 significant halos in their 18 deg@xmath0 area . among them , 5 halos turn out to be _ known _ clusters of galaxies , 2 seem to have associated _ light _ concentrations but no spectroscopic confirmation , and the remaining _ uncertain _ 7 ( 50 % ) had no apparent counterpart in either optical nor x - ray data .",
    "@xcite undertook a search on the same data adopting a different peak selection algorithm and a lower detection threshold .",
    "they found 158 `` possible mass concentration '' on the 18 deg@xmath0 field . if those halos are divided into the same classes as above ( _ known , light , uncertain _ ) , the ratio is almost the same as @xcite .",
    "regardless , almost half of the _ gabods _ halos could be considered uncertain at this point",
    ".    meanwhile , we find 15 halos in a 2.24 deg@xmath0 field ( xmm - wide ) and show that 80 % of have been already identified as clusters .",
    "it is too early to make any definite conclusion because their spectroscopic is underway .",
    "however , our ( tentatively ) higher success rate could be explained at least in part by the larger number density of faint galaxies , @xmath87 , usable for the weak lensing analysis owing to larger aperture and better average seeing . in the case of _ gabods _ , @xmath87 spans from 6 to 28 arcmin@xmath37 depending on the field ; the average value is 11 arcmin@xmath37 .",
    "this is generally smaller than our @xmath87 shown in table  [ tab : survey_field ] . as a result one can expect a lower angular resolution of the @xmath70 map , reducing the s / n ratio for a fixed smoothing scale and possibly an increased degree of contamination in the resulting halo catalog .",
    "another possibility to explain the increased contamination is that their sample consists of a combination of different sets of catalogs , each of which is selected by different methods .",
    "this could decrease the significance threshold effectively , and could introduce more false peaks .",
    "@xcite estimated , based on their simulation , that the halo superposition rate in survey such as ours should be roughly 3 % - a small but not negligible effect",
    ". a longslit spectroscopic survey , such as that undertaken with lris ( green et al , in prep ) might be poorly - suited for locating such cases .",
    "however , the focas multi - object survey reported here should reliably find them .",
    "in fact , we have found three apparent superposition halos ( sl j0222.8 - 0416 , sl j1051.5 + 5456 and sl j1047.3 + 5700 ) out of 26 examined .",
    "the overlap rate is broadly consistent with expectation considering the small number so far sampled .",
    "we have introduced a new subaru imaging survey and described techniques for locating and verifying shear - selected halos . across a search area of 16.72 deg@xmath0",
    "we have found 100 halos whose @xmath70 s / n exceeds 3.69 .",
    "we have described the first phase of a detailed follow - up campaign based on multi - object spectroscopy of 26 halos using focas on the subaru telescope . a later paper in this series ( green et al , in prep ) will extend the spectroscopic survey to the full sample using a longslit approach .",
    "detailed studies on one of our fields , the xmm - wide field , show that 80% of the shear selected 15 halos in the 2.2 deg@xmath0 area can be confirmed as genuine clusters of galaxies .",
    "10 overlap with x - ray detections and two are new systems confirmed spectroscopically .",
    "the overall success rate and reliability of our sample provides convincing proof that , with care , a weak lensing survey can provide a large sample of mass - selected halos .",
    "we compare our success rate and the reliability of our catalog with that of the _ gabods _ survey and conclude a major advantage of our approach is the superior imaging depth which leads to a high surface density of usable galaxies .",
    "this suggests future , more ambitious , surveys for shear - selected halos will be more effective if undertaken with large aperture telescopes .",
    "it is interesting to use our results to estimate the requirements for a future survey motivated by the need to constrain dark energy .",
    "@xcite discuss hypothetical missions which would aim to analyze the redshift distribution @xmath1 of 10,000 clusters .",
    "figure  [ fig : seeingdens ] shows that our survey technique typically finds 5 halos deg@xmath37 . because the field size of suprime - cam is @xmath9 0.25 deg@xmath0 , it takes two hours to cover 1 deg@xmath0 assuming the exposure time of 30 minutes of each field as adopted in this study .",
    "a survey of 10,000 clusters would be prohibitive even in terms of imaging alone ( @xmath9 500 clear nights ) even before contemplating the follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "the hyper suprime - cam ( hsc ) project @xcite has been proposed to remedy this shortcoming .",
    "hsc is expected to have a field of view ten times larger than suprime - cam while maintaining the same image quality .",
    "this new facility will makes the 2000 deg@xmath0 scale imaging survey within a reasonable number of clear nights .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up might be enabled by the proposed prime focus multi object optical spectrograph wfmos ( wide field fiber multi object spectrograph ) whose field is 1.5 deg@xmath0 in diameter .",
    "typically we can expect @xmath2510 shear - selected clusters in each spectroscopic field . with only 20 targets per halo ,",
    "only a small fraction of the several thousand fibers envisaged for wfmos need be allocated to the halo verification program .",
    "we are very grateful to subaru astronomers : y. oyama , k. aoki and t. hattori for their dedicated supports of the focas observing .",
    "numerical computations presented in this paper were carried out at the astronomical data center ( adc ) and at the center for computational astrophysics ( cfca ) of the national astronomical observatory of japan . this work is supported in part by grant - in - aid for scientific research ( kaken - hi ) of japan society for the promotion of science ( jsps ) : project number 15340065 ( sm&th ) and 17740116 ( th ) .",

    "the shear induced by massive cluster of galaxies is expected to be 7@xmath9 10 % .",

    "fig : fwhmee ] ) , but the difference is not so significant .",
    "therefore , the correction of the anisotropy is very important to make a precise kappa map . here",
    ", we examine the psf anisotropy suprime - cam , and evaluate the effect of imperfect correction in this work .    in order to characterize the anisotropy of the suprime - cam images , we obtained sequences of i-band short exposures ( 1 min ) of dense stellar fields with various telescope pointings over one night long .",
    "the seeing was mostly @xmath9 0.65 arcsec ( fwhm ) .",
    "the psf anisotropy is approximated as an elliptical , and the field position dependence of the ellpticities are investigated .",
    "two examples of such ellipticity fields are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : starfield_e_examples ] . general tendency that we note is that the fields can be represented as a super - position of ( 1 ) the radial field at four corners ( almost invariant ) and ( 2 ) almost unidirectional field ( variable ) .",
    "the variable components is most likely due to the telescope shaking whereas the invariant component can be explained by the optical aberration of the corrector .",
    "slight asymmetry of the radial component is visible ( i.e. ellipticities near the lower left corner is larger than other corners ) , and this would be a sign of imperfect optical alignment",
    ".    we also note that the discontinuity of ellipticities is not visible across the boundary of the ccds , and the ellipticities can be represented as a single continuous function of field position .",
    "we adopt 5-th order polynomial function here . in order to simulate the actual science field analysis ,",
    "we randomly select controls stars and `` galaxy role '' stars from the star catalogs with an appropriate density ; 2 arcmin@xmath92 and 40 arcmin@xmath92 , respectively . using the control stars , we obtain the best fit coefficients of the polynomial , and the anisotropy of `` galaxy role '' stars is corrected using eqn .",
    "[ psmcorrection ] . because the intrinsic ellipticities of `` galaxy role '' stars is all zero , the residual ellipticities after the correction is a estimate of incompleteness of the correction .",

    "the ellipticities is reduced down to about 0.75 % after the correction . beyond the field angle of 18 arcmin ,",
    "the correction does not work fine and we decided to eliminate the field r @xmath24 18 from lensing analysis ; which , however , results in only a few percent loss of fov .    we estimated a psf anisotropy caused by the optical aberration using a ray - tracing code , _",
    "zemax_. the calculated psf is convolved with 0.65 arcsec fwhm gaussian , and the shape is evaluated by elliptical .",
    "the result is shown in filled square in fig  [ fig : radreal](a ) .",
    "compared with this ideal case , the observed ellipticities is large even after the correction .",
    "this shows a limit of the adoption of single polynomial function as a representatives of the psf anisotropy , where the residual is still locally correlated correlated and not completely random .",
    "we now want to evaluate the impact of the incompleteness onto the @xmath70 s / n map .",
    "the map is created based by the residual ellipticities after the correction .",
    "we simulate the galaxy ellipticities using the following `` conversion '' formula @xcite , @xmath93 which is essentially a sensitivity correction against the psf anisotropy .",
    "this is necessary because galaxies are larger and their shape is more insensitive to the deformation compared with stars .",
    "we evaluate @xmath94 with @xmath95 where we adopt @xmath96 which is a typical value under the typical 0.7 arcsec seeing . since the @xmath97 here , the conversion factor is roughly @xmath98 .",
    "we omit @xmath48 correction because it cancels out in this case when we calculate the s / n .",
    "we created twelve such maps from independent exposures , and co - added the peak distribution functions to obtain fig  [ fig : radreal](b ) .",
    "it is obvious that the incompleteness of the anisotropy correction is quite unlikely to create any significant ( say s / n @xmath24 3 ) fake peaks ."
