    "there is compelling evidence that massive black holes ( mbhs ) lie in the centers of all galaxies @xcite , including in the center of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "the mbh affects the dynamics and evolution of the galaxy s center as a whole ( e.g. @xcite ) and it also strongly affects individual stars or binaries that approach it . such close encounters , which may be extremely energetic , or involve non - gravitational interactions , or post - newtonian effects , have been the focus of many studies ( see review by @xcite ) .",
    "these processes include the destruction of stars by the mbh , either by falling whole through the event horizon , or by being first tidally disrupted and then accreted ( e.g. @xcite ) ; tidal scattering of stars on the mbh @xcite ; the capture and gradual inspiral of stars into the mbh , accompanied by the emission of gravitational waves or by tidal heating ( e.g. @xcite ) ; or dynamical exchange interactions in which incoming stars or binaries energetically eject a star tightly bound to the mbh and are captured in its place very near the mbh ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the interest in such processes is driven by their possible implications for the growth of mbhs , for the orbital decay of a mbh binary , for the detection of mbhs , for gravitational wave ( gw ) astronomy , as well as by observations of unusual stellar phenomena in our galaxy , e.g. the puzzling young population of b - star very near the galactic mbh @xcite , or the hyper - velocity b stars at the edge of the galaxy @xcite , possibly ejected by 3-body interactions of a binaries with the mbh @xcite .",
    "here we focus on close encounters with the mbh whose ultimate outcome ( `` event '' ) is the elimination of the incoming object from the system , whether on the short infall ( dynamical ) time , if the event is prompt ( e.g. tidal disruption or 3-body exchange between a binary and the mbh ) , or on the longer inspiral time , if the event progresses via orbital decay ( e.g. gw emission or tidal capture and heating ) .",
    "such processes are effective only when the incoming object follows an almost zero angular momentum ( `` loss - cone '' ) orbit with periapse closer to the mbh than some small distance @xmath5 . to reach the mbh , or to decay to a short period orbit",
    ", both the infall and inspiral times must be much shorter than the system s relaxation time @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the fraction of stars initially on loss - cone orbits is very small and they are rapidly eliminated .",
    "subsequently , the close encounter event rate is set by the dynamical processes that refill the loss - cone .    the loss - cone formalism used for estimating the event rate ( @xcite ) usually assumes that the system is isolated and that the refilling process is 2-body relaxation .",
    "this typically leads to a low event rate , set by the long 2-body relaxation time .",
    "two - body relaxation , which is inherent to stellar systems , ensures a minimal loss - cone refilling rate .",
    "other , more efficient but less general refilling mechanisms were also studied with the aim of explaining various open questions ( e.g. the stalling problem of mbh binary coalescence , @xcite , or mbh feeding , @xcite ) or in the hope that they may lead to significantly higher event rates for close encounter processes .",
    "these mechanisms include chaotic orbits in triaxial potentials @xcite ( the presence of a mbh may however destroy the triaxiality near the center ; @xcite ) ; increased fraction of low angular momentum orbits in non - spherical potentials @xcite ; accelerated resonant relaxation of angular momentum near the mbh where the orbits are keplerian @xcite ; perturbations by a massive accretion disk or an intermediate mass black hole ( imbh ) companion @xcite .",
    "most of these mechanisms require special circumstances to work ( e.g. specific asymmetries in the potential ) , or are short - lived ( e.g. the imbh will eventually coalesce with the mbh ) .    here",
    "we explore another possibility , which is more likely to apply generally : accelerated relaxation and enhanced rates of close encounters driven by massive perturbers ( mps ) .",
    "efficient relaxation by mps was first suggested by @xcite to explain stellar velocities in the galactic disk .",
    "mps remain an important component in modern models of galactic disk heating ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a similar mechanism was suggested to explain the spatial diffusion of stars in the inner galactic bulge @xcite .",
    "in addition to dynamical heating , efficient relaxation by mps was suggested as a mechanism for loss cone replenishment and relaxation , both in the context of scattering of oort cloud comets to the sun @xcite and the scattering of stars to a mbh in a galactic nucleus @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested mps as a mechanism for establishing the @xmath7 relation @xcite by fast accretion of stars and dark matter .",
    "they also noted the possibility of increased tidal disruption flares and accelerated mbh binary coalescence due to mps . in this study",
    "we investigate in detail the dynamical implications of loss - cone refilling by mps .",
    "we evaluate its effects on the different modes of close interactions with the mbh , in particular 3-body exchanges , which were not considered by @xcite , and apply our results to the galactic center ( gc ) , where observations indicate that dynamical relaxation is very likely dominated by mps .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  [ s : outline ] we present the main concepts and procedures of our calculations .",
    "the observational data and theoretical predictions about mps in the inner @xmath8 pc of the gc are reviewed in  [ s : gc_mps ] . in section ",
    "[ s : interact ] we explore the implications of relaxation by mps for various types of interactions with the mbh .",
    "we summarize our results in  [ s : summary ] .",
    "in addition to stars , galaxies contain persistent dense structures such as molecular clouds , open clusters and globular clusters with masses up to @xmath9@xmath10 .",
    "such structures can perturb stellar orbits around the mbh much faster than 2-body stellar relaxation ( hereafter `` stellar relaxation '' ) , provided they are numerous enough .",
    "this condition can be quantified by considering a test star randomly scattered by perturbers with masses in the interval ( @xmath11 ) and number density @xmath12 , approaching it with relative velocity @xmath13 on orbits with impact parameters in the interval ( @xmath14).@xmath15 the minimal impact parameter still consistent with a small angle deflection is @xmath16 ( the capture radius ) , where @xmath13 is of the order of the local velocity dispersion @xmath17 .",

    "mps with substantially larger impact parameters are much less efficient because their effect on the mbh - star pair is tidal rather than direct .",

    "recent observations of hvss @xcite are consistent with a gc origin and favor a steady state temporal distribution and an isotropic spatial distribution over a burst - like non - spherical distribution that is expected for hvss triggered by the infall of a cluster @xcite .    two of the recently observed hvss ( @xmath314@xmath315 , @xcite ) were spectrally identified as late bv young massive stars ( masses of @xmath208@xmath316 , ms lifespans of @xmath317@xmath318 yr and number fraction @xmath319 in the population ) , implying a total population of @xmath320 such hyper - velocity stars in the galaxy @xcite .",

    "taking only the gmcs into account , we predict that tens to hundreds such hvss exist in the galaxy , in agreement with the deduced hvs populations , whereas stellar relaxation predicts only 1.3 such stars ( see table [ t : bin ] ) .",
    "we note @xcite used the @xmath327 total rate of hyper - velocity star ejection calculated by @xcite ( including binaries of all stellar types , assuming stellar relaxation only and normalized to a fiducial 10% binary fraction ) to estimate the number of late bv hvss in a salpeter imf at @xmath145@xmath328 .",
    "this theoretical prediction seems in rough agreement with the observations ( and contradicts our much lower estimate of 1.3 hvss ) .",
    "however , the rates of yu & tremaine are inapplicable here and lead to a significant over - estimate of the number of hvss because their binary population model is not appropriate for massive binaries in the gc . on the one hand",

    "the binary fraction of young massive binaries is 70% rather than 10% (  [ sss : youngbin ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the agreement found by brown et al .",
    "is accidental , and that binary disruption by stellar relaxation is insufficient to explain the number of observed hvss , whereas mp - induced relaxation can reproduce the observations .",
    "relaxation by mps dominates relaxation by 2-body stellar interactions when the ratio between the 2nd moments of their respective mass functions satisfies @xmath330 .",
    "we show that galactic mps ( stellar clusters , gmcs and smaller molecular gas clumps that exist outside the inner few pc ) dominate and accelerate relaxation in the inner @xmath8 pc of the gc .",
    "this is plausibly the case in the centers of late - type galaxies in general .",
    "there is also evidence for molecular gas in the centers of late - type galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) , which suggests that mps may dominate relaxation there as well , and lead to the relaxation of the central regions of galactic bulges in general .",
    "relaxation determines the rate at which stars and binaries are deflected to near radial ( loss - cone ) orbits that bring them closer to the mbh than some critical periapse @xmath5 , where they undergo a strong destructive interaction with it .",
    "the size of @xmath5 depends on the nature of the interaction of interest ( e.g. tidal disruption , 3-body exchange ) .",
    "it is much larger for binaries than for single stars due to the binary s larger effective size .",
    "we extend loss - cone theory to approximately treat rare encounters with mps , and apply it to explore the implications of mps on the rates of different types of close encounters .",
    "the rate reaches its maximum when loss - cone orbits are replenished by scattering within an orbital time ( the full loss - cone regime ) .",
    "this is more easily achieved when the phase - space volume of the loss - cone is small , that is , when @xmath5 is small .",
    "mps thus affect only those processes with large @xmath5 whose loss - cone is too large to be efficiently replenished by stellar encounters ( the empty loss - cone regime ) .",
    "we show that mps will not contribute much to the disruption of single stars in the gc , whose loss - cone is efficiently replenished by stars outside the central @xmath169 pc ( mps may accelerate the consumption of stars by more massive mbhs , where @xmath5 is significantly larger , or the capture of stars in accretion disks ) .",
    "however , mps will enhance by factors of 101000 the tidal disruption rate of infalling binaries , which result in the capture of one of the stars on a tight orbit around the mbh , and the ejection at high velocity of the other star @xcite .",
    "the enhancement of the event rates is dominated by the innermost mps , and so the uncertainty in the mp distribution on the smallest scales dominates the uncertainties in the total event rate .",
    "detailed observations of mps in the inner gc allow us to robustly predict their effects in the galaxy .",
    "we show that mp - induced disruptions of relatively rare massive binaries can naturally explain the puzzling presence of normal - appearing main sequence b stars in the central @xmath307 pc of the gc @xcite , and at the same time can account for the observed hvss well on their way out of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "tidal disruptions of the many more faint low - mass binaries can efficiently supply single stars on very eccentric tight orbits near the mbh .",
