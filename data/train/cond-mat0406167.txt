    "quantum computation promises enormous technological advances in the field of information processing and the quest for its realization has attracted many strong contenders in the field of physics and engineering .",
    "this paper is concerned with a scheme for quantum computation put forward by barnes , shilton and robinson,@xcite which falls into the semiconductor quantum dot category.@xcite the proposal for quantum computation is based on the results of ongoing experiments that have demonstrated the capture and transport of single electrons in moving quantum dots .",
    "the dots are formed when a surface acoustic wave ( saw ) travels along the surface of a piezoelectric semiconductor containing a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ sawdevice ] for a schematic diagram of the device .",
    "when the saw is made to pass through a constriction in the form of a quasi - one - dimensional channel ( q1dc ) , the induced piezoelectric potential drags electrons into and along the q1dc . in certain parameter regimes",
    "the device transports one electron per potential minimum of the saw.@xcite the spin on the trapped electron represents the physical qubit .",
    "quantum computation involves performing qubit operations on the trapped electrons as they move with the speed of the saw .",
    "many schemes for quantum computation , such as conventional quantum dots , doped silicon,@xcite superconducting boxes,@xcite and ion traps,@xcite involve static qubits .",
    "the surface acoustic wave quantum computer on the other hand is of the `` flying qubit '' type , which include linear optics schemes,@xcite some ion trap schemes with ion shuttling@xcite and schemes based on coherent electron transport in quantum wires.@xcite all these have in common that the carriers of quantum information physically move through space during the computation . flying qubits have the advantage of being able to distribute information quickly over large distances across the quantum circuit when decoherence times are short and to interface with quantum memory registers at fixed locations .",
    "another advantage of the saw quantum computation scheme is its ensemble nature .",
    "it intrinsically performs time - ensemble computation , in much the same way nmr quantum computation performs molecular - ensemble computations.@xcite time - ensemble computation alleviates the demand for single - shot spin measurements and has the advantage of being robust against small random errors .",

    "detailed modeling of the gate operation has been accomplished by means of both analytic solutions and numerical simulations of the pauli equation .",
    "we show how electrostatically confined moving electrons behave under the influence of various magnetic fields and discuss the implications for quantum computing with surface acoustic wave electrons .",
    "the physics of the saw - guided qubit is explained in more detail in section [ section : qubit ] . in sections [ section : unitary ] and [ section :",
    "readout ] , we present results on single - qubit unitary gates and single - qubit readout gates based on the stern - gerlach effect . section [ section : neglect ] discusses some of the decoherence processes involved in quantum - dot based schemes .",
    "section [ section : summary ] is a summary of the results with parameter regimes of interest for future experiments .",
    "we begin by summarizing the quantum computation scheme proposed by barnes , shilton and robinson.@xcite figure [ sawdevice ] shows a schematic diagram of the experimental setup originally designed to demonstrate quantized currents in semiconductors .",
    "a nicr / al interdigitated transducer",
    "is patterned on a gaas / algaas heterostructure .",
    "a narrow depleted q1dc splits the 2deg into two regions , the source and drain .",
    "when a high frequency ac signal is applied to the transducer , a saw propagates through the 2deg , producing a periodic piezoelectric potential across the 2deg .",
    "the potential drags electrons in the source region through the narrow q1dc constriction into the drain .",
    "it has been shown experimentally that over a range of saw power and gate voltages , the current passing through the q1dc is quantized in units of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the electronic charge and @xmath2 is the frequency of the saw.@xcite the smallest quantized current observed corresponds to the transport of a single electron in each saw minimum .",
    "typically , the saw in gaas moves at @xmath3 at a frequency of around @xmath4 , with an applied power of @xmath5.@xcite these parameters produce currents in the range of nanoamps .",
    "given the ability to trap single electrons in the saw minima , the scheme for quantum computation is as follows .",
    "it is possible for an array of @xmath6 q1dcs in parallel to capture @xmath6 qubits in every @xmath7th minimum , with a single electron in each q1dc , producing a qubit register along the saw wavefront .",
    "@xmath7 can be chosen sufficiently large to ensure that the coulomb interaction between successive qubit registers do not interfere with each separate computation .",
    "the qubits move with the minima of the saw , passing through a sequence of static one- and two - qubit gates before arriving at an array of spin readout devices .",
    "one - qubit gates may be operated by nanoscale electromagnetic fields .",
    "where two - qubit gates are needed , neighboring q1dcs are allowed into a tunnel contact controlled by a potential on a surface gate.@xcite the use of the coulomb coupling between neighboring q1dcs is a common tool in spintronics which can be used to generate entangled states in dual - rail qubit representations.@xcite figure  [ sawnetwork ] illustrates the network of q1dcs and qubit gates envisaged for performing a particular quantum computation .     , width=325 ]",
    "the saw - trapped electron is well confined in all three spatial directions . in this paper",
    "we define cartesian coordinates such that the saw propagates along the @xmath8 axis with the @xmath9 axis normal to the 2deg .",
    "the 2deg is produced by a band - energy mismatch at the gaas / algaas interface which gives rise to a confining potential in the @xmath9 direction .",
    "the energy level spacings in the",
    "2deg well are on the order of @xmath10.@xcite further confinement in the @xmath11 direction is provided by an extended q1dc , etched into the surface so as to avoid screening the saw - induced potential with metallic surface gates.@xcite finally , the confinement in the @xmath8 direction is due to the saw potential minimum which is approximately sinusoidal .",
    "the saw amplitude is typically 40 mev,@xcite which is sufficiently large to prevent qubits being lost via tunneling into neighboring saw minima .",
    "there are two important aspects of the saw quantum computation scheme that distinguishes it from other similar quantum dot schemes .",
    "first , the scheme provides repetitions of the same quantum computation with each passing of a single wavefront of the saw .",
    "therefore , a statistical time - ensemble of identical computations can be read out at the end of the q1dcs as a measurable current , alleviating the need for single - electron measurements .",
    "two sources of noise in the measured current may be estimated as follows : the shot noise is largely determined by how well the current is quantized to @xmath12 and precisions of @xmath13 can be experimentally achieved.@xcite johnson noise arises from the resistance of the ohmic contacts and the 2deg which are on the order of @xmath14 . at temperatures of @xmath15",
    "they produce a rms voltage noise spectral density on the order of @xmath16 at most .",
    "this can not drive a current noise through the saw device since its effective intrinsic impedance of @xmath17 is comparatively very large .",
    "see experimental papers@xcite for more detailed discussions . the second key aspect of the scheme is the static nature of the gate components of the quantum circuit .",
    "this alleviates the need for strong , targeted and carefully - timed electromagnetic pulses that can be difficult and expensive to implement .",
    "the requirement of such expensive control resources often limit the scalability of most quantum computing implementations .",
    "it would certainly be convenient , though not essential , to have a means of preparing a pure fiducial qubit state . in nmr quantum computing ,",
    "operations are carried out on ensembles of replica qubits which remain close to a highly mixed state of thermal equilibrium .",
    "nevertheless , a successful readout of the computation is obtained because the sum over many identical computations provides a measurable signal .",
    "similarly in the saw quantum computing scheme , states close to the maximally - mixed state are still useful because of the time - ensemble nature of the scheme . however ,",
    "in contrast to nmr schemes , it is in principle possible to read out single electrons in the saw scheme",
    ". we will therefore begin with nonensemble quantum computation in mind and only later exploit the advantages of ensemble computation to deal with noise .",
    "of course , the more pure the qubit states remain , the faster the computation will converge to the result . for these reasons , we describe in this paper two simple methods for preparing pure fiducial qubit states .    in the original proposal for the saw quantum computer,@xcite",
    "it was noted that the application of an external magnetic field of about @xmath18 will influence which spin states of electrons are favored in the capture process.@xcite this polarized capture process can be summarized as follows .",
    "the saw is strongly screened in the bulk 2deg until it is raised above the fermi energy and the quantum dot begins to form . when the higher - energy minority quantum dot forms for the higher - energy sub - band of polarized electrons , the probability of capturing minority electrons is small ( see fig .",
    "[ bcapture ] ) , whilst the probability of capturing electrons from the lower - energy sub - band is large .",
    "once a cloud of approximately polarized electrons is captured , the exchange interaction will generally entangle electrons in the same dot together , so that the subsequent loss of electrons into the fermi sea will lead to a decoherent process that could relax the remaining electrons into the low - energy polarized state .",
    "a more detailed multiparticle analysis will be needed to determine the final state of the remaining single electron , but the combination of the above two processes is likely to lead to a high level of polarization .",
    "is the fermi energy .",
    "the saw is strongly screened in the bulk 2deg below the fermi energy .",
    "as the saw enters the q1dc constriction , the confining potential begins to form .",
    "the probability of capturing spin - down is small at the point the minority spin - type dot forms ( upper curve ) .",
    "in contrast , the probability of capturing spin - up electrons is high when the majority spin - type dot forms ( lower curve ) .",
    "[ bcapture ] , width=325 ]    the above method is conceptually simple and would be easy to implement in the laboratory .",
    "however , the macroscopic magnetic field required in the capture region will need to be shielded from the rest of the device where the quantum computation is to be carried out , and this may present a nontrivial problem .",
    "if we chose to drive spin flips using microwave pulses , then the macroscopic field is actually required across the whole device",
    ". however , the problem with using microwaves is their relatively long wavelength which tends to affect every part the computation .",
    "alternatively , we may use local , static magnetic fields to initialize , rotate and read out single qubits without a global magnetic field . in section  [ section :",
    "readout ] , it will be demonstrated that spin - polarized electrons can be prepared and measured using a gate driven by the stern - gerlach effect .",
    "first we turn to the implementation of single qubit rotations using local static magnetic gates .",
    "single - qubit unitary operations may be carried out , in principle , by allowing the trapped single electrons to pass through regions of uniform magnetic field .",
    "if there is no spin - orbit coupling effect , the spin state of the qubit will evolve according to the zeeman term in the hamiltonian : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the magnetic field , @xmath21 is the vector form of the 3 pauli operators and @xmath22 is a spinor .",
    "the bloch vector @xmath23,2\\ , \\mathrm{re}[\\alpha\\beta^*],|\\alpha|^2-|\\beta|^2\\right)$ ] precesses about the direction of the magnetic field with angular frequency @xmath24 .",
    "a local static magnet may be produced by a magnetic force microscope or by evaporative deposition of a ferromagnetic material such as cobalt , or a permalloy such as nife .",
    "inevitably , different samples will produce different strengths of magnetic field .",
    "but there are methods to vary the strength and pattern of the field once the sample has been fabricated .",
    "it has been demonstrated that ferromagnetic properties of thin - film 3d transition metals can be modified via ion irradiation.@xcite another method would be to use oxidation techniques with the atomic force microscope .",
    "only two independent directions of the b - field are necessary to produce an arbitrary single - qubit manipulation and we will choose these to be perpendicular to the direction of the saw , one aligned with and the other perpendicular to the 2deg .    for idealized qubits with no spatial degree of freedom ,",
    "the above model for single - qubit rotations is complete .",
    "however , the trapped electron is a charged particle with a spatial distribution within the dot . the fields couple to both the spatial and spin degrees of freedom , causing the electron to experience the lorentz force as well as spin - precession .",
    "it is therefore clear that one can not increase magnetic fields arbitrarily , since the lorentz force will upset the confinement properties of the electron .",
    "nor can the direction of the field be chosen arbitrarily without consequences for the robustness of the gate . to address these concerns",
    ", we analyze the behavior of the full wavefunction : a two - component spinor field defined over space and time , @xmath25 , under the action of gates operated by static magnets .      assuming a uniform magnetic field in the lab frame",
    ", we solve the pauli equation for the spin field from which the probability density field and the bloch vector field can be obtained .",
    "the qubit is trapped in a net electrostatic potential with contributions from the q1dc split gates , the 2deg confining potential and the saw piezoelectric potential .",

    "the appropriate nonrelativistic equation for the two - component spinor field is the schrdinger equation with a pauli hamiltonian . for an electron moving in an arbitrary vector potential @xmath38 and potential energy @xmath39 ,",
    "the pauli hamiltonian @xmath40 is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the electronic charge , @xmath43 is the land g - factor and @xmath44 is the effective mass in gaas . by simulating in the plane of the 2deg we simplify to a 2 + 1 dimensional model , with variables @xmath45 . if the particle were chargeless but with an anomalous magnetic moment , terms in @xmath40 that explicitly involve @xmath1 can be dropped .",
    "in such a case , there is no lorentz force acting on the particle , the schrdinger equation simplifies significantly and there would be no need to concern ourselves with the spatial behavior of the qubit .    before proceeding further ,",
    "it is convenient to transform into the rest frame of the electron moving with the saw speed @xmath46",
