    ", this approach is also not satisfactory as it has turned out that mpccs are in fact even more difficult to handle than mpvcs .",
    "this makes it necessary , both from a theoretical and numerical point of view , to consider special tailored algorithms for solving mpvcs .",
    "recent numerical methods follow different directions . a smoothing - continuation method and a regularization approach for mpccs",
    "are considered in @xcite and a combination of these techniques , a smoothing - regularization approach for mpvcs is investigated in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the relaxation method has been suggested in order to deal with the inherent difficulties of mpvcs .    in this paper",
    ", we carry over a well known sqp method from nonlinear programming to mpvcs .",
    "we proceed in a similar manner as in @xcite , where an sqp method for mpccs was introduced by benko and gfrerer .",
    "the main task of our method is to solve in each iteration step a quadratic program with linear vanishing constraints , a so - called auxiliary problem .",
    "then we compute the next iterate by reducing a certain merit function along some polygonal line which is given by the solution procedure for the auxiliary problem . to solve the auxiliary problem we exploit the new concept of _ @xmath1-stationarity _ introduced in the recent paper by benko and gfrerer @xcite .",
    "@xmath1-stationarity is in general stronger than m - stationarity and it turns out to be very suitable for a numerical approach as it allows to handle the program with vanishing constraints without relying on enumeration techniques .",
    "surprisingly , we compute at least a @xmath1-stationary solution of the auxiliary problem just by means of quadratic programming by solving appropriate convex subproblems .    next we study the convergence of the sqp method .",
    "we show that every limit point of the generated sequence is at least m - stationary .",
    "moreover , we consider the extended version of our sqp method , where at each iterate a correction of the iterate is made to prevent the method from converging to undesired points .",
    "consequently we show that under some additional assumptions all limit points are at least @xmath1-stationary .",
    "numerical tests indicate that our method behaves very reliably .",
    "a short outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we recall the basic stationarity concepts for mpvcs as well as the recently developed concepts of @xmath0- and @xmath1-stationarity .",
    "in section 3 we describe an algorithm based on quadratic programming for solving the auxiliary problem occurring in every iteration of our sqp method .",
    "we prove the finiteness and summarize some other properties of this algorithm . in section 4",
    "we propose the basic sqp method .",

    "we consider the extended version of the overall algorithm and we discuss its convergence .",

    "<S> we propose an sqp algorithm for mathematical programs with vanishing constraints which solves at each iteration a quadratic program with linear vanishing constraints . </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm is based on the newly developed concept of @xmath0-stationarity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate how @xmath1-stationary solutions of the quadratic program can be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> we show that all limit points of the sequence of iterates generated by the basic sqp method are at least m - stationary and by some extension of the method we also guarantee the stronger property of @xmath1-stationarity of the limit points .    * </S>",
