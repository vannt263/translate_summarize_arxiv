    "the dense regions can accelerate the formation of so via slow neutral - neutral reactions by increasing the collision rate between the reactants .        in order to investigate the detailed velocity structures of the cloud , unveil the presence or absence of velocity gradients , identify cores with large velocity dispersion ( @xmath30",
    ", @xmath30 is the one - dimensional velocity dispersion ) , we produced 1st and 2nd moment maps ( figure [ map2 ] ) . from the 1st moment image , cores @xmath19 to @xmath31 and @xmath23 have velocities of 0 to 40 km@xmath2s@xmath0 , and cores @xmath32 to @xmath21 and @xmath28 of the cloud have 40 to 100 km@xmath2s@xmath0 .",

    "we regard the above kinematic condition as being one of the key structures in massive cloud formation .",

    "if we apply the cloud size of 2.8  pc , the velocity gradient becomes to be 0.33  km  s@xmath0  pc@xmath0 , which is an order of magnitude smaller than our result of 20  km  s@xmath0  pc@xmath0 .",
    "such a large velocity gradient in the cloud is strange compared with the previous studies of the star forming regions .",
    "these observational results imply that these velocity structures are related to the initial conditions in the cloud , and must be preserved during the ages ( several 10@xmath13yr : kauffmann et al .",

    "the filamentary structures and cores of so in g0.25 cloud are very similar to results of cloud cloud collision simulations .",

    "they assumed that mass ratio of both clouds is 1:4 and the radius ratio is 1:2 .",
    "they considered internal random motions of clouds as the effective sound speeds .",
    "the clouds collided each other with mach numbers of the relative speeds , 5@xmath510 . since their simulation was carried out assuming the isothermal equation of state , we can change their physical parameters of the small cloud into the radius of @xmath51.5  pc , and mass of @xmath50.5@xmath52 , and the larger one into the radius of @xmath53  pc , and mass of @xmath52@xmath910@xmath13  m@xmath53 . their relative speeds are @xmath530 - 60  km  s@xmath0 , which are consistent with our result .",
    "they found that a gravitational instability is triggered by a non - identical cloud - cloud collision .",
    "they showed that the large cloud is disrupted and shell structures are formed by the bow shock induced by the collision with the small cloud , and that the small cloud is compressed by the shock induced by the collision with the large cloud and its gravitational collapse is triggered .",
    "anathpindika et al .",
    "( 2010 ) also discussed the stability of the bow - shock resulting from their simulation of head - on collision between clouds of different sizes .",
    "three - dimensional simulations of similar collisions between non - identical clouds were performed by takahira et al .",
    "( 2014 ) submitted that explored formation of filamentary structures and dense cores in the collision between clouds of different masses under varying collision velocities .",
    "they also show the formation of the bow shock at the collision interface , the inclusion of turbulence producing a jagged shell of shocked gas .",
    "this fragmented into multiple dense cores , which rapidly accreted while in the shocked gas to form objects that could be the precursors to massive stars .",
    "these features are very similar to our observation .",
    "inoue et al . ( 2013 ) demonstrate that massive and gravitationally unstable molecular cloud cores are formed behind the strong shock waves induced by cloud - cloud collision .",
    "the conclusions drawn here may also be relevant to the shells driven by powerful winds from young super star - clusters or expanding supernovae shells .",

    "( 2009 ) reported super - star cluster formation triggered by the cloud - cloud collision mechanism .",

    "they found three cores toward the m42 h ii region with velocity dispersions ( @xmath37 ) , significantly larger than those of the other cores , suggesting that the energy input from the h ii region increases the velocity dispersion .",
    "the large-@xmath37 cores have the potential to form the most massive stars because the mass infall rate is proportional to the third power of the velocity width ( @xmath55=0.975@xmath56/g : from mckee @xmath4 tan 2003 ) . from the 2nd moment map of so",
    ", we found that the areas of large velocity dispersion ( @xmath37@xmath5 30 to 40 km@xmath2s@xmath0 ) are distributed along the shell - like structure . from the above results , we consider that these regions possibly contain large-@xmath37 cores , which will form high - mass stars .",
