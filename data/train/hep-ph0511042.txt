    "high energy photon and neutrino and their scattering channels based on the standard model are currently of interest to many authors in astrophysics and cosmology @xcite-@xcite . in the low energy limit the elastic photon - neutrino scattering",
    "is strongly suppressed by yang s theorem in the lowest order @xcite . meanwhile , the inelastic scattering of photon - neutrino such as @xmath5 and its crossed processes are not subject to this suppression i.e. @xmath6 in comparison with @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in the high energy limit it is shown that @xcite @xmath8 while @xcite @xmath9",
    "in which the photon energy , @xmath10 , in the center of mass frame satisfies @xmath11 .",
    "obviously , with increasing @xmath10 the elastic cross section exceeds the inelastic one and it can be easily seen that the crossover occurs at @xmath12 . in the high energy limit the non - commutativity effects seem to be significant and therefore the new interactions of photon and neutrino in the non - commutative space and time can be potentially important to astrophysics .",
    "however , non - commutative field theory and its phenomenological aspects have been recently considered by many authors @xcite-@xcite .",
    "such theories are mostly characterized on a non - commutative space - time with the non - commutativity parameter @xmath13 . in the canonical version of the non - commutative space - time",
    "one has @xmath14,\\ ] ] where a hat indicates a non - commutative coordinate and @xmath13 is a real , constant and anti - symmetric matrix .",
    "the action for field theories on non - commutative spaces is then obtained by using the weyl - moyal correspondence ; accordingly , the usual product of fields should be replaced by the star product : @xmath15 in replacing the ordinary product with the star product there is an ambiguity in transcribing @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are coupling constant , gauge and particle fields , respectively , into non - commutative form that is : @xmath20 , @xmath21 or @xmath22 . in the commutative limit all the terms can be reduced to the same term while for the neutral particles , for example in qed , the third term in the non - commutative limit is essentially different from the other two . in fact",
    "this can bring about direct interaction of photon and neutral particles .    in section 2",
    "we give a brief review on the direct interaction of neutral particles with photon in the non - commutative qed and subsequently extend the non - commutative standard model ( ncsm ) based on @xmath23 gauge group to incorporate the direct interaction of photon with neutrino . in section 3",
    "we explore the photon - neutrino elastic scattering in the extended minimal ncsm as well as the non - minimal ncsm at the lowest order .",
    "finally , we compare our results with the results on the photon - neutrino scattering given in the literature .",
    "in the frame work of ncqed it is shown that the neutral particles interact with photons if they transform under u(1 ) in a similar way as in the adjoint representation of a non - abelian gauge theory .",
    "in fact , for this purpose @xmath24 should be added to ordinary derivative to construct the covariant derivative @xcite-@xcite . in the limit of @xmath25 , we have @xmath26 therefore the covariant derivative to the lowest order can be obtained as follows @xmath27 the fields themselves in the non - commutative space can be expanded by the seiberg - witten ( sw ) map @xcite up to the lowest order as @xmath28 @xmath29.\\label{a}\\ ] ] therefore the interaction term in terms of commutative fields is @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 it should be noted that for neutrino as a neutral particle in the ncqed , as well as qed , in contrast with the standard model , there is not any constraint on the mass or even the chirality of the neutrino . in the standard model ,",
    "neutrino is massless and only the left handed one has weak interaction while the right handed neutrino , if existing , has an expectator role in all reactions .",
    "however , there are two approaches to construct the standard model in the non commutative space . in the minimal extension",
    "the gauge group is @xmath23 in which the number of gauge fields , couplings and particles are the same as the ordinary one @xcite .",
    "although in this extension new interactions will appear due to the star product and the sw map , the photon - neutrino vertex is absent .",
    "in the second approach the gauge group is @xmath33 which is reduced to @xmath23 by an appropriate symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "however , in the latter approach , besides many new interaction like the former one , photon can interact with the left handed neutrino .    to introduce the neutrino - photon interaction in the minimal ncsm",
    ", one can define the adjoint representation in the covariant derivative for the neutral particle as is done in the ncqed .",
    "the main difference in the sm is @xmath34 instead of @xmath35 .",
    "therefore neutral hyper charge particle can only couple to the hyper gauge field in a gauge invariant manner .",
    "the only particle with zero hyper charge in the sm is the right handed neutrino therefore the covariant derivative for this particle can be written as follows @xmath36 in which @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively , denote the nc - fields of the right handed neutrino and the hyper charge with their own expansion in the nc - space as are given in eqs.([psi]-[a ] ) .",
    "consequently , lagrangian density for the right handed neutrino part of ncsm can be written as follows @xmath39\\label{lagden},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 in terms of the photon and the @xmath41-gauge boson fields is @xmath42 therefore the feynman rules for @xmath1 and @xmath43 vertices can be obtained from the lagrangian ( [ lagden ] ) as : @xmath44 and @xmath45 it should be noted here that in the minimal extension of the standard model to the non - commutative space - time ( mncsm ) there is not any @xmath1-vertex while the @xmath43-vertex has already existed for the left handed neutrino therefore @xmath46 for the right handed neutrino can be considered as a correction to the same vertex in the mncsm . since the other particles in the sm , even the left handed neutrino , all have nonzero hyper charge , the remaining parts of the sm in the noncommutative space do not change .",

    "in fact the freedom in the choice of the traces can be used to construct a new version of the ncsm which is called nmncsm .",
    "neutral triple - gauge boson vertices such as @xmath48 and @xmath49 in contrast to the mncsm as well as sm can arise within the framework of the nmncsm .",
    "these vertices can be extracted from the lagrangian of nmncsm which are given in @xcite as follows @xmath50 @xmath51,\\label{zgg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 @xmath55 the constants @xmath56 , @xmath57 and so on are functions of the coupling constants of the non - commutative electroweak sector up to the first order of @xmath58 .",
    "they can be obtained by matching the ncsm action with the sm action and their allowed range of values is given in @xcite . however , up to the first order of @xmath58 in the nmncsm , there is a feynman diagram which is shown in fig.(1 ) .",
    "the feynman rule for the @xmath59 vertex in the nmncsm can be easily derived from the lagrangian of eq.([zgg ] ) as follows +    ( 300,25)(0,0 ) ( 340,-17)(340,19)3 ( 300,-35)(340,-17)27.5(340,-17)(380,-35)27.5 ( 340,-17)3(57,-7)[c]@xmath60     + in which @xmath57 is the strength of the @xmath61 triple - gauge bosons and @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",

    "in contrast to the nmncsm in the mncsm there is not any triple gauge boson vertex in the electro - weak sector therefore we have not any diagram at the tree level for the elastic photon - neutrino scattering .",
    "but in the extended version of mncsm which is introduced in section 2 the photon can interact directly with right handed neutrino therefore at the tree level there are two feynman diagrams for the photon - neutrino elastic scattering which is shown in fig.2 .",

    "in this paper , we extended the non - commutative standard model based on the minimal @xmath0 gauge group to include the interaction of the neutral gauge bosons with the neutrino . since in the gauge invariant manner",
    "only the particle with neutral hyper - charge can couple to the hyper - gauge field , the right handed neutrino part of the ncsm lagrangian density changes as is given in eq.([lagden ] ) .",
    "consequently , we obtained the feynman rule for the @xmath1-vertex which does not exist in the minimal extension of the non - commutative standard model introduced in @xcite , while for the @xmath43-vertex we find some corrections given in eqs.([gnn]-[znn ] ) .",
    "we explored the photon - neutrino elastic scattering in both the nmncsm and the extended version of mncsm . in the former model , the left handed neutrino at the tree level can interact with photon via z - gauge boson exchange as is shown in fig.(1 ) .",
    "we showed that the cross section grows as @xmath118 in the center of mass and depends on the new undetermined constant , @xmath57 , as well as the parameter of non - commutativity , see eq.([cross - nm ] ) .",
    "the cross section for @xmath119 varies in the range @xmath80-@xmath81 @xmath82 for @xmath83 and @xmath84 which is comparable with its counterpart in the commutative space though @xmath57 varies in the range @xmath120 and it may be zero .",
    "nevertheless , the photon - neutrino elastic scattering is also examined in the extended version of mncsm where photon can interact directly with neutrino . in this case",
    "there are two feynman diagrams at the tree level which are presented in fig.(2 ) . since the parameter of non - commutativity is the only mass scale , the cross section should be proportional to @xmath121 which is explicitly obtained in eq.([sigma final0 ] ) .",
    "comparison of eq.([sigma final1 ] ) and eq.([elastic pn ] ) with eq.([inelastic pn ] ) shows that the three cross sections are equal for @xmath122 while the value of the photon - neutrino elastic scattering cross section in the non - commutative space at @xmath123 is about two times the value of its counterpart in the commutative space .",
    "therefore , at sufficiently high energies the process @xmath124 in the non - commutative space dominates the processes @xmath124 and @xmath125 in the commutative space . nonetheless , for the higher values of @xmath75 the elastic cross section in the nc - space will be comparable with the elastic one in the commutative space at the higher energies .",
    "for example for @xmath126 at @xmath127 it is still one percent of the cross section of @xmath124 in the sm while they are equal at @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , in the high energy limit the right handed neutrino has the same contribution to the photon - neutrino scattering as the left handed one and is not the expectator particle .    .",
