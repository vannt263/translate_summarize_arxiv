    "the nonrelativistic quantum mechanics solution of the four - nucleon scattering problem has , in the past five years , reached a level of sophistication and numerical accuracy that makes it a natural theoretical laboratory to study nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) force models with the same confidence as one has used the three - nucleon system in the past . this has been demonstrated in a recent benchmark for @xmath1 and @xmath2 elastic scattering observables @xcite , where three different theoretical frameworks have been compared , namely , the hyperspherical harmonics ( hh ) expansion method @xcite , the faddeev - yakubovsky ( fy ) equations @xcite for the wave function components in coordinate space @xcite , and the alt , grassberger and sandhas ( ags ) equations @xcite for transition matrices that were solved in the momentum space @xcite .",
    "all methods include not only the hadronic nn interaction , but also the coulomb repulsion between protons .",
    "while the first two methods have the advantage of being able to deal with charged - particle reactions at very low energies and include static three - nucleon forces ( 3nf ) , the third one is the only method so far to make predictions for multichannel reactions such as @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 ( and the corresponding inverse reactions ) @xcite .    in a previous publication @xcite a major step",
    "was taken in extending the ags calculations above three- and four - cluster breakup thresholds .",
    "owing to the complicated analytic structure of the four - body kernel above breakup threshold the calculations were performed using the complex energy method @xcite whose accuracy and practical applicability was greatly improved by a special integration method @xcite .",
    "this allowed us to achieve fully converged results for @xmath1 elastic scattering with realistic nn interactions .",
    "we note that the fy calculations of @xmath1 elastic scattering have been recently extended as well to energies above the four - nucleon breakup threshold @xcite , however , using a semi - realistic nn potential limited to @xmath7-waves .    in the present work",
    "we extend the method of ref .",
    "@xcite to calculate the neutron - neutron - deuteron @xmath8 recombination into @xmath9 and its time - reverse reaction , i.e. , the three - cluster breakup @xmath10 .",
    "although breakup reactions are usually measured in nuclear physics , the recombination has the advantage that its rate is finite at threshold where the breakup cross section vanishes due to phase - space factors .",
    "furthermore , @xmath11 is the only hadronic recombination reaction in the four - nucleon system that at threshold is not suppressed by the coulomb barrier ( like @xmath12 ) or pauli repulsion ( like @xmath13 ) .",
    "it can take place in any environment with neutrons and deuterons and , with respect to the tritium synthesis , it may be competitive to the electromagnetic capture reaction @xmath14 .",
    "thus , one may rise the question at what conditions the @xmath11 recombination would dominate over the @xmath14 radiative capture and to what extent it is relevant for astrophysical processes .",
    "in addition , we also present results for the @xmath9 elastic scattering and study the energy dependence of the total @xmath9 cross section .",
    "we use the time - reversal symmetry to relate the @xmath15 recombination amplitude to the three - cluster breakup amplitude of the initial @xmath1 state , i.e. , @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the @xmath1 channel state and @xmath18 is the @xmath15 channel state .",
    "the advantage is that the three - cluster breakup amplitude @xmath19 is more directly related to the ags transition operators @xmath20 calculated in our previous works @xcite .",
    "since we use the isospin formalism where the nucleons are treated as identical fermions , there are only two distinct two - cluster partitions , namely , @xmath21 corresponds to the @xmath22 partition ( 12,3)4 whereas @xmath23 corresponds to the @xmath24 partition ( 12)(34 ) . for the initial @xmath1 state",
    "we need only @xmath25 , i.e. , we solve the ags equations for the four - nucleon transition operators    [ eq : ags ] @xmath26    the free resolvent with the complex energy parameter @xmath27 and the free hamiltonian @xmath28 is @xmath29 whereas the pair ( 12 ) transition matrix @xmath30 is derived from the respective potential @xmath31 .",
    "the 3 + 1 and 2 + 2 subsystem transition operators are obtained from the integral equations @xmath32 the basis states are antisymmetric under exchange of the two nucleons ( 12 ) . in the @xmath24 partition",
    "the basis states have to be antisymmetric also under exchange of the two nucleons ( 34 ) .",
    "the full antisymmetry as required for the four - nucleon system is ensured by the permutation operators @xmath33 of nucleons",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    the @xmath1 elastic and inelastic reaction amplitudes at the available energy @xmath38 are obtained in the limit @xmath39 . here",
    "@xmath40 is the @xmath41 ground state energy , @xmath42 is the relative @xmath1 momentum , and @xmath43 , @xmath44 being the nucleon mass . the elastic scattering amplitude is calculated in refs .",

    "here @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are the four - particle jacobi momenta as given in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 are the corresponding orbital angular momenta , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the total angular momenta of pairs ( 12 ) and ( 34 ) , @xmath58 is the total angular momentum of the ( 123 ) subsystem , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the spins of nucleons 3 and 4 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 are the channel spins of two- , three- , and four - particle systems , and @xmath64 is the total angular momentum with the projection @xmath65 .",
    "we include a large number of four - nucleon partial waves , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , such that the results are well converged . the complex - energy method @xcite with special integration weights @xcite is used to treat the singularities of the ags equations . to obtain accurate results for the breakup amplitude @xmath19 near the @xmath15 threshold we had to use @xmath68 mev @xmath69 mev that are smaller than @xmath70 mev @xmath71 mev used in the elastic scattering calculations of ref .",
    "however , the need for relatively small @xmath72 values caused no technical problems since the integration with special weights @xcite provides very accurate treatment of the @xmath41 pole whereas the quasi - singularities due to deuteron pole are located in a very narrow region with very small weight , such that about 30 grid points for the discretization of each momentum variable were sufficient .",
    "the @xmath15 recombination rate @xmath73 is defined such that the number of recombination events per volume and time is @xmath74 with @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) being the density of neutrons ( deuterons ) . we calculate it as a function of the relative @xmath15 kinetic energy @xmath77 , i.e. , @xmath78 here @xmath79 mev is the deuteron bound state energy , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the reduced masses associated with the four - nucleon jacobi momenta @xmath82 and @xmath52 .",
    "for example , in the 2 + 2 configuration @xmath82 is the relative momentum of the two neutrons while @xmath52 is the relative momentum between the center of mass ( c.m . ) of the two - neutron subsystem and the deuteron .",
    "the @xmath15 state can be represented in both 3 + 1 and 2 + 2 configurations equally well ; @xmath83 .",
    "the sum in eq .",
    "runs over all initial and final spin projections @xmath84 that are not explicitly indicated in our notation for the channel states while @xmath85 takes care of the spin averaging in the initial @xmath15 state .",
    "the integral in eq .",
    ", up to a factor , determines also the total cross section @xmath86 for the three - cluster breakup of the initial @xmath1 state .",
    "thus , the @xmath15 recombination rate can be related to @xmath86 as @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the number of @xmath1 spin states .",
    "below the four - nucleon breakup threshold @xmath86 can be obtained via the optical theorem as a difference between the total and elastic cross sections .",
    "the equation can not be used right at the @xmath15 threshold where both @xmath89 and @xmath86 vanish .",
    "for @xmath90 the @xmath15 recombination rate becomes @xmath91 where for the channel state @xmath92 the relative momenta @xmath93 .",
    "the most convenient representation for @xmath92 is a single - component 2 + 2 state with @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "we study the four - nucleon system using realistic high - precision two - nucleon potentials , namely , the inside - nonlocal outside - yukawa ( inoy04 ) potential by doleschall @xcite , the argonne ( av18 ) potential @xcite , the charge - dependent bonn potential ( cd bonn ) @xcite , and its extension cd bonn + @xmath96 @xcite allowing for an excitation of a nucleon to a @xmath96 isobar and thereby yielding effective three- and four - nucleon forces . among these potentials",
    "only inoy04 nearly reproduces experimental binding energy of @xmath41 ( 8.48 mev ) , while av18 , cd bonn and cd bonn + @xmath96 underbind the @xmath41 nucleus by 0.86 , 0.48 and 0.20 mev , respectively .",
    "first we study the @xmath1 reactions for existing experimental data .",

    "@xcite , the total @xmath97-@xmath41 cross section around the low - energy peak is underpredicted by the traditional two - nucleon potentials while the low - momentum or chiral effective field theory potentials may provide a better description @xcite .",
    "although with increasing energy the predictions approach the experimental data , as already mentioned @xcite , the elastic and total cross section data may be inconsistent . in the low - energy regime where the inelastic cross section should vanish for",
    "@xmath102 mev and remain very small at @xmath103 mev , there is in general a better agreement between predictions and experiment for the elastic differential cross section than for the total cross section which is significantly underestimated by theory . a solution to this discrepancy may require new measurements in this energy regime .",

    "the number of events , i.e. , the number of produced @xmath41 nuclei per volume and time is @xmath119 with @xmath120 being the @xmath118 capture rate .",

    "this corresponds to the mass density of @xmath123 .",
    "thus , one may conclude that at the neutron density available in the laboratories ( such as national ignition facility with expected @xmath124 to @xmath125 @xcite ) the @xmath15 recombination is entirely irrelevant as well as for the big - bang nucleosynthesis where the estimated baryon density is even lower . on the other hand ,",
    "the neutron density in core - collapse supernova or neutron stars may be higher than @xmath126 by several orders of magnitude but the absence of deuterons renders @xmath127 and @xmath128 reactions irrelevant .",
    "however , based on our results one may conjecture that at such high densities the three - cluster recombination of two neutrons and a heavier nucleus @xmath129 , i.e. , @xmath130 might be as important as the corresponding radiative capture @xmath131 .",
    "for example , the above reactions with @xmath129 being @xmath132ne are relevant for the neon - burning process . +",
    "we have solved the four - nucleon ags equations in the energy regime above the three - cluster threshold and studied the rate for the recombination reaction @xmath11 .",
    "the obtained results show that the @xmath15 recombination is not competitive with the radiative @xmath118 capture for the production of tritium at neutron densities available in laboratory induced fusion or astrophysical processes .",
    "thus , one may conjecture with a confidence that other nucleon - nucleon - deuteron recombination reactions ( for example , @xmath133 that could contribute to the hydrogen burning process in stars ) , being in addition suppressed by the coulomb repulsion , are inferior to the respective nucleon - deuteron radiative capture reactions at realistic densities , and that four - nucleon recombination reactions are even far less relevant .",
    "in addition , we presented results for the @xmath1 elastic differential cross section at @xmath134 mev and the @xmath1 total cross section up to @xmath135 mev . while the elastic cross section agrees fairly well with the data , there is a disagreement for the total cross section , especially in the low - energy regime .",
    "this indicates a possible inconsistencies between the @xmath1 elastic and total cross section data and calls for new measurements ."
