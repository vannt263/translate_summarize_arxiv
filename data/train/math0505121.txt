    "the historical background for noncommutative index theory has two basic parts .",
    "the first one dates back to the nineteen fifties , when israel gelfand pointed out to sir michael atiyah that the index of a fredholm operator was stable under small perturbations .",
    "the ultimate consequence of this remark is quite famous : the atiyah - singer index theorem @xcite .",
    "the second part is development of noncommutative geometry by alain connes @xcite .",
    "in particular , two noncommutative versions of the chern character were developed .",
    "there is one due to connes @xcite and a more recent one due to connes and moscovici @xcite .",
    "we are interested in this more recent version , which is called the _ residue cocycle_. its individual terms are certain residues which are geometrically interesting , as pointed out by higson .",
    "however , they are not very well understood .    in the present paper",
    ", we shall prove a formula which resembles the formula of connes and moscovici in @xcite , albeit in a classical setting .",
    "suppose @xmath9 is a compact smooth manifold with no boundary .",
    "let @xmath10 be a @xmath1-graded complex vector bundle .",
    "let @xmath11 be an elliptic , odd , first - order , skew - adjoint differential operator on @xmath2 .",
    "finally , let @xmath12 be the standard projection map of the cotangent bundle . with this setup , we will establish a formula for the chern character of the symbol of @xmath11 which resembles the connes - moscovici chern character in noncommutative geometry .",
    "it is comprised of finitely many residues of zeta functions constructed from the symbol of @xmath11 and a connection on @xmath2 .",
    "we shall use quillen s formalism in which the symbol @xmath13 of @xmath11 , together with a connection on @xmath2 , determines a superconnection on @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "quillen s superconnection @xmath15 encodes all the information necessary to define the chern character in a single object .",
    "we shall denote it by @xmath16 .",
    "the supertrace of @xmath17 is a mixed differential form which enjoys the major properties of the ordinary chern character : it is closed and its cohomology class depends only on the underlying vector bundle , not on @xmath3 or @xmath13 .",
    "but rather than passing to its cohomology class on @xmath4 , we take advantage of the fact that this form is rapidly decreasing on the fibers of @xmath4 . we get this convenient property by sacrificing the traditional @xmath18 factor , an error which we shall also address .",
    "thus , we define a current on @xmath19 by the poincare duality formula @xmath20 if we expand this dual `` chern character current '' in the taylor series , we obtain :    @xmath21     = pd\\left[\\operatorname{tr_s}(1+\\nabla_l+{\\frac 1 { 2 ! } } \\nabla_l^2+\\ldots)\\right]\\ ] ] the terms on the right are closed forms and their cohomology classes depend on the isomorphism type of @xmath14 only",
    ". however , they are not rapidly decreasing and we can not form the dual currents by coupling them with the pullback of an arbitrary smooth form on @xmath9 .",
    "we resolve this issue through _ analytic regularization _",
    ", to be addressed in section [ section : form ] , and thus obtain a new formula for the dual chern character .",
    "briefly , our main result can be stated as follows :    * theorem . * for @xmath22 ,",
    "let @xmath23 be the @xmath24-tubular neighborhood of the zero section of @xmath4 . then : @xmath25.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the limit arises due to divergence of negative powers of @xmath13 near zero .",
    "we now proceed to briefly describe the connes - moscovici local chern character , i.e. , the noncommutative chern character .",
    "the chern character in @xcite is a periodic cyclic cohomology class in @xmath26 .",
    "this cohomology is constructed from spaces of multilinear functionals on @xmath27 .",
    "see @xcite , chapter 10 , for construction of @xmath26 .",
    "the connes - moscovici chern character is represented by a sequence of multilinear functionals on @xmath27 which we proceed to describe .",
    "the n - th term of the sequence is zero for @xmath28 ; for @xmath29 , let @xmath30 be the elements of @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath31 be the supertrace and let @xmath32 be the variable running through _ all _ @xmath33-multiindices with nonnegative integer entries .",

    "as it stands , the operators whose trace we are taking typically fail to be bounded , let alone trace class .    to us , the most important fact about the connes - moscovici formula is that this chern character is a sum of residues of @xmath36 times the gamma function .",
    "our main result expresses the quillen s representative of the ( classical ) chern character as a sum of very similar quantities .",
    "much like the proof in @xcite , our argument hinges on the mellin transform .",
    "in this section , we give an overview of superconnections according to quillen @xcite . this notion",
    "shall be used to define chern character in the spirit of chern - weil theory .",

    "observe that @xmath39 is naturally a left @xmath19-module .",
    "the definition [ section : grmult ] resembles the usual definition of multiplication on a tensor product of two algebras .",
    "however , it takes the @xmath1-grading into account .",
    "such products of superalgebras are called _ graded tensor products _ and are denoted by @xmath53 .    next , observe that the @xmath1-grading on @xmath2 naturally induces one on the space of sections @xmath45 , which makes it possible to speak of even and odd linear endomorphisms of this space .",
    "the even ones preserve the @xmath1 grading and the odd ones switch it .",

    "our result is motivated by the connes - moscovici formula .",
    "we express the right - hand side of the atiyah - singer index theorem in a way which resembles their residue cocycle .",

    "the factor of @xmath90 is to correct for the error introduced by leaving the @xmath91 out of quillen s definition of chern chracter .",
    "the right - hand side is really concerned with the poincare dual of @xmath89 , i.e. with the following linear functional @xmath92\\co\\eta\\mapsto\\int_{t^*m}\\pi^*(\\eta)ch(l).\\ ] ]    [ section : expdecr ] the quantity @xmath93 decays exponentially along the fibers of @xmath4 .",

    "the necessary estimates for this lemma are provided in section 3 of @xcite .",
    "essentially , it is true because @xmath11 is selfadjoint , so that @xmath13 is antiselfadjoint and @xmath99 is negative - definite , which is where the ellipticity of @xmath11 comes in . also , @xmath99 increases polynomially on the fibers of @xmath4 .",

    "in particular , this means that there is a fiberwise metric @xmath371 on @xmath176 .",
    "let @xmath495 be the associated spinor bundle .",

    "thus , the spin structure induces a @xmath1-grading of @xmath498 .    in order to form a chern character we need a connection @xmath86 on @xmath498 which respects that @xmath1-grading .",
    "we also need an odd antiselfadjoint endomorphism @xmath13 of @xmath505 .",
    "the spinor bundle setup in @xcite requires , among other things , that :    * @xmath13 be homogeneous of degree 1 in the radial coordinate @xmath97 of the fibers of @xmath176 .",

    "@xmath86 preserve the fiberwise metric @xmath507 which is induced on @xmath498 by the metric @xmath371 of @xmath176 .",
    "this means that for any two sections @xmath508 and @xmath210 of @xmath498 , @xmath509    the coordinate notation is the same as in the proof of theorem [ theorem:1 ] .",
    "the local coordinates on @xmath176 are the vertical ( fiberwise ) cartesian coordinates are @xmath510 , and the horizontal coordinates @xmath511 , which are also coordinates of @xmath9 .",
    "in fact , it makes sense to choose the @xmath371-orthonormal local frame @xmath512 of @xmath176 and to choose coordinates @xmath513 associated to that frame .",
    "they may be replaced by spherical coordinates @xmath97 and @xmath514 at our convenience",
    ".    to describe @xmath13 we recall that the spin structure of @xmath176 stems from the fiberwise metric @xmath371 . to begin with , we have the _ clifford action _ of @xmath176 on @xmath498 which is a fiberwise @xmath515-linear bundle map @xmath516 such that for any @xmath517 in @xmath504 , @xmath518 .",
    "it is one of the standard axioms for a clifford actions that @xmath519 be fiberwise anti - selfadjoint endomorphism .",
    "thus , each fiber @xmath504 is contained in a clifford algebra @xmath520 , which is a fiber of the bundle @xmath521 . also , there is a map @xmath522 which is an isomorphism of bundles and fiberwise an isomorphism of algebras .",
    "now , the pullback @xmath523 to the total space of @xmath176 is equipped with the clifford action on @xmath505 which we shall also denote @xmath524 instead of @xmath525 .",
    "let @xmath526 be the tautological section .",
    "then the endomorphism @xmath527 has all the required properties .",
    "its homogeneity in @xmath97 is obvious and it is antiselfadjoint by hypothesis .    abbreviating @xmath528 by @xmath529 , we may write @xmath530 . since the construction of the clifford action on spinors using an orthonormal basis is completely canonical , the coordinate expression for @xmath13 does not involve the @xmath231-variables .",
    "since , @xmath531 it follows that @xmath532 .",
    "next , to pick a connection on @xmath86 , we start with a connection on @xmath176 which is locally given by @xmath61 .",
    "the connection @xmath86 on @xmath498 is constructed from it ( see @xcite and @xcite ) . in order to describe the construction",
    ", we adopt the _ summation notation _ : we reserve the right to write any index as an upper or a lower index .",
    "( since we have chosen an orthonormal local frame , there is no difference at all ) .",
    "repetition of the same index on the top and on the bottom implies summation .",
    "repetition on the top only or on the bottom only does * not*. the connection on @xmath505 is given by @xmath533 where @xmath534 are just the matrix entries of the endomorphism - valued@xmath535-form @xmath60 .",
    "the connection @xmath536 on @xmath505 therefore makes sense .",
    "observe that since @xmath529 are odd , the local endomorphism @xmath537 of @xmath505 is even .",
    "moreover , it only depends on the variables @xmath538 and horizontal differentials @xmath539 , just as before .",
    "therefore , the curvature of the connection @xmath16 may be written as : @xmath540-\\rho^2\\\\\\nonumber & = \\nabla^2+d\\xi^j\\gamma_j+{\\frac { \\xi^k}4 } [ \\theta^{ij}\\gamma_i\\gamma_j,\\gamma_k]-\\rho^2\\\\\\nonumber & = \\nabla^2+(d\\xi^j)\\gamma_j+{\\frac { \\xi^j}4 } \\theta^{ij}\\gamma_i-\\rho^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , just as in the previous example , the fact that @xmath99 is a scalar is a tremendous simplification .",
    "we may use taylor series instead of cauchy integrals and we have the rule @xmath541      * @xmath543 are complementary ( strictly increasing ) multiindices over the set @xmath544 and @xmath545 is a certain combinatorial @xmath546-valued function of them , which shall not be relevant here .",
    "* @xmath547 is the pfaffian of the submatrix of @xmath548 determined by the multiindex @xmath549 . for an unfamiliar reader , it suffices to know that it is a certain polynomial in the matrix entries of @xmath325 which is just @xmath535 if @xmath549 is the empty multiindex .    for us , ( [ section : qmch ] ) is greatly simplified by the fact that we are only interested in the currents induced by this chern character on @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , as observed in theorem [ theorem:1 ] and lemma [ theorem : poles ] , we need only those terms of ( [ section : qmch ] ) which involve _ all _ the differentials @xmath550 , so the only relevant multiindex is @xmath551 , @xmath549 being empty and @xmath547 being @xmath535 .",

    "we now recall ( [ section : qmch ] ) .",
    "it involves the sum over multiindices @xmath558 and the only relevant multiindex was determined to be @xmath559 , where @xmath560 is the fiberwise dimension of @xmath176 .",
    "this means that in ( [ section : st3qm4 ] ) only the terms with @xmath561 contribute to the current induced by chern character on @xmath19 .",
    "we have seen a special case of this in the previous example , where a normal coordinates argument was used to show that only the terms which involve two copies of @xmath291 $ ] are relevant .",

    "contributing_. ) in particular , it means that @xmath291 $ ] contributes the vertical differentials and no other differentials .",
    "coming back to our computation , the right - hand side of ( [ section : st3qm4 ] ) is readily seen to be the taylor series for @xmath562 .",

    "it remains to determine the residues , using the procedure from theorem [ theorem:1 ] .",
    "just as in that theorem , we set @xmath566 and integrate from @xmath24 to @xmath567 with respect to @xmath97 .",
    "this , as we shall see , produces the residue at @xmath568 .",

    "we obtain : @xmath574 counting the differential form degrees , we see that if @xmath575 , then the only contributing term of ( [ section : st3qm4 ] ) is the @xmath576-th term . here",
    "@xmath32 satisfies @xmath577 .",
    "this term produces a residue at @xmath578 which is a current on @xmath143- forms .",
