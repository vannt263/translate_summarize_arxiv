    "for describing evolutionary dynamics the framework of fitness landscapes has been introduced , see for instance  @xcite .",
    "a fitness landscape formulates relationships between genetic specifications , individual instantiations , and their fitness .",
    "together with postulating differences in fitness over all possible genetic specifications and a moving bias towards higher fitness , the setup suggests the picture of an evolving population that is moving directedly on the landscape . on a conceptual level , this picture is based on the notion of evolutionary paths that are created by the topological features of the fitness landscape .",
    "evolutionary paths are a succession of moves on the landscape with persistently ascending fitness values .",
    "the existence and abundance of such evolutionary paths gives rise to estimates about how likely a transition from low  fitness regions to high  fitness regions in the landscape is .",
    "these transitions instantiate evolutionary dynamics .",
    "apart from fitness landscapes , another approach for specifying evolutionary dynamics is evolutionary games ,  @xcite .",
    "evolutionary games are mathematical models of dynamic interactions between individuals in a population and explain how their behavioral strategies ( for instance cooperation or competition ) spread in a population .",
    "the main question is how adoption of the strategies contributes to payoff collecting and consequently to the fitness characterizing the success of each individual .",
    "an evolutionary game becomes dynamic if it is played iteratively over several rounds and the individuals are allowed to change their strategies and/or to recast the network describing with whom they are interacting .",
    "such an iterated evolutionary game comprises of an evolving population of individuals acting as players and can be seen as an expression of evolutionary dynamics .",
    "given the fact that there are two frameworks for addressing evolutionary dynamics , it is natural to ask about their relationships .",
    "unfortunately , both frameworks are not immediately compatible .",
    "although it is acknowledged that evolutionary games cast fitness landscapes , it has become clear that such game landscapes change with an evolving population of players ,  @xcite .",
    "this is attributed to frequency  dependent selection . in other words ,",
    "game landscapes are dynamic .",
    "based on some earlier results on dynamic fitness landscapes , e.g.  @xcite , there are some first attempts at applying these ideas to games , for instance ,  @xcite . in this paper dynamic landscapes",
    "are employed for analyzing coevolutionary games by using and extending a framework introduced recently ,  @xcite .",
    "games are considered where the players may update their strategies ( evolutionary games ) , see e.g.  @xcite , but also games where the players may additionally change their network of interaction ( coevolutionary games ) , see e.g.  @xcite . in particular",
    ", it is shown that the proposed method makes it possible to model and analyze evolutionary games and coevolutionary games within the same framework .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : desc ] , some basic definitions are given , and evolutionary and coevolutionary games are briefly recalled .",
    "[ sec : gamedynamic ] reviews game dynamics , particularly the processes to update strategies and networks of interaction .",
    "dynamic landscape models of coevolutionary games are introduced and discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : land ] .",
    "the modeling procedure is demonstrated for prisoner s dilemma ( pd ) and snowdrift ( sd ) games that both use either birth  death ( bd ) or death  birth ( db ) strategy updating .",
    "it is further shown that bd and db updating yield landscapes with symmetry properties , and that replacement restrictions entail symmetry breaking .",
    "moreover , the local topological features of absorbing configurations of the games are interpreted as absorption structure .",
    "it is described how landscape properties may be linked to fixation via the absorption structure .",
    "[ sec : num ] reports numerical experiments on landscape measures such as modality , ruggedness and information content . fixation probabilities and fixation times are calculated as well as network measures characterizing the networks of interaction of the coevolutionary games . it is shown and discussed how the landscape measures relate to both fixation properties and network measures .",
    "[ sec : con ] closes the paper with a summary and conclusions .",
    "the coevolutionary dynamics of the games considered in this paper stems from three levels of activity : ( i ) game playing , ( ii ) updating the strategy , and ( iii ) updating the network of interaction .",
    "the game playing is done by a finite population of @xmath0 players @xmath1 that use one of two strategies @xmath2 during each round @xmath3 .",
    "a player @xmath4 , @xmath5 , can either cooperate ( @xmath6 ) or defect ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "a pairwise interaction between two players @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( which can be seen as player and coplayer ) yields rewards in form of payoff @xmath10 as given by the payoff matrix @xmath11 for player and coplayer using the same strategy , @xmath12 or @xmath13 , they both obtain the reward @xmath14 for mutual cooperation ( @xmath15 ) or the punishment @xmath16 for mutual defection ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "a mixed choice of strategy gives one of them the sucker payoff @xmath18 for cooperating with a defector , and the other one the temptation @xmath19 to defect while the coplayer is cooperating .",
    "hence , for @xmath20 , there is @xmath21 and @xmath22 , while for @xmath23 , there is @xmath24 and @xmath25 . depending on the numerical values of @xmath26 and their order , particular examples of the game",
    "are obtained , which have become metaphors for studying social dilemmas and discussing strategy selection along with the effect on short and long  term success in accumulating payoff ,  @xcite .",
    "most prominently , there are prisoner s dilemma ( pd ) games , where @xmath27 , and snowdrift ( sd ) games , where @xmath28 .",
    "the payoff @xmath29 of player @xmath8 in round @xmath30 depends not only on the player s strategy @xmath31 and the values of the payoff matrix ( [ eq : payoff ] ) , but also on who its coplayer is ( or more precisely as to what the coplayer s strategy is ) and how many coplayers there are .",
    "the question of who  plays  whom in a given round of the game is addressed by the network of interaction",
    ". a convenient way of expressing and visualizing the network of interaction is by using elements from evolutionary graph theory ,  @xcite .",
    "evolutionary graph theory places each player of the population on a vertex of an ( undirected ) graph .",
    "this graph describes the network of interaction and consequently it can be called an interaction graph . as there are no empty vertices and a vertex can only be occupied by one player , the number of vertices of the graph equals the number of players @xmath0 . for each player ,",
    "its coplayers are indicated by edges that connect the vertex of the player with the vertices of the coplayers .",
    "such an edge defines the connected players to be adjacent .",
    "each vertex can have up to @xmath32 edges ( self  play is not allowed ) . as the degree @xmath33 is the number of edges incident with a vertex ,",
    "the degrees of the interaction graph equal the number of coplayers that are engaged with each player in a single round .",
    "a graph is called regular if the degree is the same for all vertices .",
    "hence , a regular interaction graph means that all players have the same number of coplayers .",
    "the interaction graph can be described algebraically by its ( interaction ) adjacency matrix @xmath34 , which is also called an interaction matrix .",
    "the matrix @xmath35^{n \\times n}$ ] is a symmetric @xmath36 matrix with entries @xmath37 indicating an edge between vertex @xmath38 and @xmath39 and @xmath40 showing that players @xmath8 and @xmath9 are not adjacent .",
    "the diagonal elements @xmath41 because there is no self  play .",
    "the symmetry of @xmath34 reflects the fact that two players @xmath8 and @xmath9 mutually engage in the game . from the perspective of player @xmath8 , the player @xmath9 may be the coplayer .",
    "if so , then from the perspective of player @xmath9 , the player @xmath8 is the coplayer .",
    "consequently , @xmath42 in the adjacency matrix @xmath34 . if all @xmath37 ( except @xmath41 ) , the graph is complete , meaning that every player has all other players as coplayers and the evolutionary game is understood to be well  mixed ,  @xcite . to summarize , for describing completely and deterministically the game and the allocation of payoff , apart from the payoff matrix ( [ eq : payoff ] ) only two other entities are necessary : the strategy vector @xmath43 with @xmath44 $ ] and the adjacency matrix @xmath34 .",
    "this setting deterministically fixes the payoff @xmath45 for each player . for making payoff @xmath46 of a player @xmath8 interpretable as reproduction rate or survival probability ( and lastly as fitness @xmath47 ) , it has been suggested to rescale @xmath46 by a positive , increasing , differentiable function ,  @xcite . in the following the linear function @xmath48 is used with the intensity of selection @xmath49 .",
    "as the game is completely determined by fixing the payoff matrix ( [ eq : payoff ] ) , the strategy vector @xmath2 , and the adjacency matrix @xmath34 , the distribution of payoff @xmath29 amongst the players remains the same if the players were to engage in the game with the same entities for a second time in round @xmath50 .",
    "put another way for these entities being constant the game can be seen as static .",
    "consequently , making the evolutionary game dynamic requires updating either the players strategies or the network of interaction , or both .",
    "there is a huge amount of work devoted to the modes of updating the player strategies in evolutionary games ,  @xcite .",
    "most models use versions of stochastic strategy updating based on a moran process , but there are also works emphasizing limiting the effect of randomness and including the self ",
    "interest of players , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "according to a moran process , in each round a player @xmath8 ( or more precisely its strategy ) is replaced by ( the strategy of ) a player @xmath9 .",
    "the players @xmath8 and @xmath9 are selected at random , but the probabilities of the selection may not be uniform , for instance depending on the players fitness , which may vary .",
    "versions of stochastic updating rules differ in several respects .",
    "differences are , for example , the actual probabilities that given players @xmath8 and @xmath9 are selected or whether or not there is an order between selecting the player providing the strategy ( the source ) and selecting the player receiving the strategy ( the target ) .",
    "finally , there may be general restrictions as to which players are allowed to be a possible source and/or target of another player .",
    "such predetermined restrictions imply a replacement structure ,  @xcite . conceptually similar to interaction ,",
    "the question of who  may  replace  whom can be described by a network of replacement .",
    "this network is expressible by a replacement graph and consequently by a ( replacement ) adjacency matrix @xmath51 , which is called a replacement matrix .",
    "the matrix @xmath52 has entries @xmath53 , and @xmath54 indicates that player @xmath8 may provide its strategy for player @xmath9 to receive .",
    "the values of @xmath54 contribute to the probabilities that player @xmath8 is source and player @xmath39 is target . if all @xmath55 for a constant @xmath56 , every player @xmath8 may be the source to every target player @xmath9 with equal probability .",
    "consequently , if there are no restrictions , the replacement graph is fully connected with evenly weighted edges .    amongst strategy updating ,",
    "the following replacement rules are frequently studied : birth  death ( bd ) , death  birth ( db ) , imitation ( i m ) , and pair  wise comparison ( pc ) ,  @xcite . for all rules there may be restrictions with respect to replacement . the rules bd and db differ in the order with which source and target are selected , with bd selecting source before target and db target before source . the probability to become a source depends on the source s fitness .",
    "i m is similar to db but with the difference that the target itself can compete with other players to become a source . in pc",
    "( also known as link dynamics ) both players are selected simultaneously and the source is replaced by the target with a probability depending on the fitness difference between the players , for instance via a fermi function .",
    "hence , i m and pc share that the source can be its own target , meaning than the strategy remains the same . to summarize , all moran  based updating rules depend only on random ( and possibly on players fitness and replacement restrictions ) , but not on details of the interaction ( for instance who the source or target are actually interacting with and what those strategies are ) .",
    "therefore , they do not account for self  interested players ,  @xcite .",
    "these reasons make it possible to disentangle player and strategy in the sense that it makes no difference from which source the target receives its strategy updating . in other words , for all these updating rules it is possible to specify probabilities that the strategy of a source @xmath8 replaces the strategy of a target @xmath9 depending only on replacement matrix and fitness ,  @xcite .      if , in addition to the strategies , also the network of interactions can be updated in evolutionary games , the game is called coevolutionary .",
    "however , the players @xmath1 of the coevolutionary game are functionally alike and can hence be thought as belonging to the same species .",
    "therefore , coevolution takes place within a single population of players and is between different features of the players function , that is game strategy and interaction network .",
    "such a coevolution is hence methodologically different from an alternative understanding of coevolution , which is between different ecological functions ( and hence different species ) , for instance between predator and prey , or between host and parasite , see e.g.  @xcite .    with the players belonging to a single population and strategy updating already addressed , coevolution in evolutionary games",
    "is in essence considering the network of interaction as dynamic , from which follows that the interaction matrix @xmath34 must be time ",
    "there is a substantial variety of schemes and rules for coevolution ,  @xcite .",
    "these schemes can be categorized according to different criteria .",
    "a first criterion is the type of dynamics of @xmath34 , for which there can be three groups : ( i ) purely random updating , ( ii ) random updating with probabilities depending on fitness or current strategy or network properties , and ( iii ) deterministic updating .",
    "a second criterion is the effect which the dynamics has on graph  theoretical properties of the networks , for instance , the number of edges ( is the number of links in the network constant or growing / shrinking ) , or the regularity of the graph ( do all players have always the same number of coplayers , or are there rules that allow specific players to become super  connected ) , or network connectivity . finally , there is the question of time scale , that is how the cycles of strategy updating relate to the cycles of network updating , for instance if the edges have a life ",
    "time depending on the number of strategy updating that the players experienced .",
    "unfortunately , the topic of network updating has not yet matured as far as to express for a given coevolutionary rule the transitions from one network of interactions to another as a probabilistic function . whereas for strategy updating , there are replacement probabilities for different updating rules ,  @xcite , the same is not known for network updating",
    ". however , it might be reasonable to assume that network updating involves creating an interaction matrix @xmath57 at point in time @xmath58 from a matrix @xmath59 at the previous point @xmath60 , for an integer time variable @xmath61 .",
    "such a succession of interaction networks can be modelled by instances of an erds  rnyi graph . in this paper ,",
    "the discussion is restricted to the case where the number of coplayers is the same for all players and constant for all updating instances .",
    "employing such a model precludes situations where a more highly connected player possesses high fitness due to its connectedness , but not necessarily due to the effectiveness of its strategy . for @xmath33 coplayers ,",
    "such an interaction graph has degree @xmath33 and belongs to a special class of erds  rnyi graphs , namely random @xmath33regular graphs .",
    "modeling the interaction network by random @xmath33regular graphs makes it possible to systematically carry out numerical experiments because recently efficient algorithms for generating such graphs became available ,  @xcite . moreover , for random @xmath33regular graphs",
    ", some analytic results about the number of different graphs are known .",
    "this , in turn , corresponds to the number of possible player  coplayer combinations . as a @xmath33regular graph with @xmath0 vertices has @xmath62 edges , the number @xmath63 needs to be even",
    "employing such an interaction network model implies that we can not have an odd number of players with an odd number of coplayers",
    ".    for a small number of edges ( @xmath64 coplayers ) @xmath33 , the number @xmath65 of different @xmath33regular graphs on @xmath0 vertices ( @xmath64 players ) can be found by enumeration , see for instance the entries in the sloane encyclopedia of integer sequences ,  @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , while @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "note that @xmath74 for all @xmath0 , which means that a complete network of interactions representing a well  mixed population holds only one instance of the matrix @xmath34 .",
    "thus , for a complete network graph the game can not be coevolutionary .",
    "it is always static with respect to interaction because no dynamic changes can be cast out of a single instance of @xmath34 .",
    "further note that @xmath65 grows rapidly . for interaction networks with @xmath75 coplayers , the number of possible player ",
    "coplayer combinations @xmath76 can be calculated exactly , as there is a recursive formula for the number of @xmath77regular graphs ,  @xcite , p.56 : @xmath78 valid for @xmath79 , with @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 . for @xmath83 ,",
    "no formula is known to compute exactly the total number @xmath65 of @xmath33regular graphs on @xmath0 vertices , but asymptotic expressions have been found ,  @xcite .",
    "asymptotically , and for @xmath84 and @xmath63 even , the number is @xmath85 based on a collection of random @xmath33regular graphs the effect of different networks of interaction on payoff collecting and fitness can be analyzed , for which a landscape approach is proposed in the next section .",
    "a general definition of a ( static ) fitness landscape @xmath86 is the triple @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is a configuration space , @xmath89 is a neighborhood structure that assigns to every @xmath90 a set of direct neighbors , and @xmath91 is a fitness function that provides every @xmath90 with a proprietary quantity to be interpreted as a quality information or fitness ,  @xcite . in this definition ,",
    "the configuration space together with the neighborhood structure expresses a ( multi  dimensional ) location , while fitness is a property of this location .",
    "the configuration space itself can be seen as an unordered ( finite or infinite ) list of configurations that genetic specifications of biological systems can have .",
    "the neighborhood structure defines a ( possibly multi  dimensional ) order of this list by establishing what is directly next to each element of the configuration space .",
    "as direct neighbors of an element have a neighborhood structure themselves , this naturally establishes distant neighbors of the element as well .    the definition of a ( static ) landscape has the consequence of each configuration possessing a constant fitness value .",
    "for several reasons this might not realistically reflect the evolutionary scenario to be described and may generally restrict the descriptive power and versatility of the landscape model .",
    "hence , assuming that fitness may change over time , while configuration space and neighborhood structure remain constant , the definition above can be extended to a dynamic fitness landscape , which can be expressed as the quintuple @xmath92 ,  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the elements of the static landscape , there is the time set @xmath93 , the set of all fitness functions @xmath94 in time @xmath95 , and the transition map @xmath96 defining how the fitness function changes over time .",
    "it is noteworthy that for a discrete time set @xmath93 , for instance for the integer numbers @xmath97 , the notion of a dynamic landscape coincides with the notion of a series of static landscapes .",
    "hence , two static landscapes @xmath98 and @xmath99 can be reformulated as one dynamic landscape @xmath100 with @xmath101 and @xmath96 describing how @xmath102 changes into @xmath103 .",
    "such a dynamic landscape model implies the time variable @xmath95 to act as an integer counting and ordering scale for dynamic instances of a static landscape .",
    "hence , @xmath95 is numerically tantamount to yet conceptually different from counting the rounds of an coevolutionary game by @xmath3 .",
    "applying a landscape approach for describing evolutionary dynamics requires addressing what may constitute a configuration @xmath90 and its neighborhood @xmath89 , and also what defines fitness @xmath104 . for the coevolutionary games described in the previous sections ,",
    "there are several modeling options , which are reviewed in the following .",
    "the actual modeling choice of @xmath88 , @xmath105 and @xmath47 and their interdependencies may either result in a static landscape or entail a landscape that is dynamic and additionally requires @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath96 to be specified .",
    "the simplest modeling choice is to equate configurations with players @xmath1 , which for @xmath0 players leads to a player configuration space @xmath106 with @xmath0 elements .",
    "the neighborhood structure follows from the @xmath33 coplayers that each player has , which can be @xmath107 .",
    "thus , the neighborhood of a player consists of all the other players with which it is mutually engaged in a game according to the interaction matrix @xmath34 .",
    "hence , assuming that each player @xmath8 can be attributed with a fitness @xmath108 , such a player landscape @xmath109 could be specified by @xmath110 .",
    "a popular form of such player landscapes is to place the players on a two  dimensional square lattice and define the coplayers to be von neumann ( or moore ) neighborhoods , which consists of the lattices cells orthogonally ( or additionally diagonally  adjacent ) surrounding a central cell  @xcite .",
    "admittedly , such an arrangement fixes the number of direct neighbors to @xmath111 ( or @xmath112 , but yields a convenient way of visualizing the quality information over the resulting two  dimensional structure , which might be one reason for the popularity of these neighborhoods .",
    "the most obvious choice of the quality information is payoff @xmath113 or quantities directly derived from it such as the linear fitness @xmath48 introduced earlier .",
    "this has led to label such landscapes as payoff landscapes ,  @xcite .",
    "there are , however , several problems with such a player landscape model .",
    "the main problem is that the configuration is the player , not its strategy , nor the strategies of its coplayers .",
    "hence , with the player s and coplayers strategies , two quantities decisive for the amount of payoff , are not directly attached to the configuration .",
    "strategies can be seen as ambiguous and polyvalent properties of the configuration of players .",
    "this means that the payoff attributable to a configuration depends on both the player s strategy and also on the strategies of its neighboring coplayers .",
    "this aspect is known as frequency  dependence , as the payoff can be seen as to depend on how frequent the strategy that the player adopts also occurs in the coplayers .",
    "consequently , frequency  dependent fitness refutes the assumption that each player @xmath8 can be attributed with a unique and static fitness . in short ,",
    "fitness derived from payoff can be seen as dynamic so that the real player landscape can not be static , but should be dynamic : @xmath114 .",
    "moreover , the dynamics of @xmath115 is caused not only by frequency  dependence , but also by strategy updating for which the player landscape model does not directly account and both these causes can hardly be separated from each other . hence , the transition map @xmath96 describing how the fitness @xmath116 relates to @xmath115 is not straightforwardly definable .",
    "in addition , modeling configurations of a landscape by players means that the neighborhood structure is expressed by the adjacency matrix @xmath34 .",
    "a variable network of interaction , as in coevolutionary games , therefore implies a changing neighborhood structure . to conclude a player landscape of a coevolutionary game would involve changing neighborhood structure as well as dynamic fitness",
    "this may make analyzing such a landscape rather complicated .",
    "there is another reason for the difficulties to deduce meaningful conclusions from payoff  based fitness over a player landscape .",
    "topological features of the landscape can be used as a starting point for estimating how likely transitions from low ",
    "fitness configurations to high  fitness configuration are and also which configurations are most likely to be a steady state of evolutionary dynamics . however , which player in a symmetric game as specified by the payoff matrix ( [ eq : payoff ] ) exactly is a likely high  fitness outcome of an evolutionary process is not very relevant .",
    "a much more important question is what fraction of the players in the long run settles stably to one of the possible strategies . in pursuing this question ,",
    "there are several works that define the quality information of the landscape to be the strategy to which a player temporarily or finally settles .",
    "this means the fitness is expressed by the strategy vector @xmath117 .",
    "the results have been visualized by coloring the players according to their strategy ,  @xcite .",
    "such a model has the advantage that the spatial and temporal distribution of the strategy preferences can be visualized with respect to the player  coplayer structure . however , payoff  based fitness as the main drive of evolutionary game dynamics is not an explicit component of such a landscape and the number of coplayers is defined by the restrictions of the adjacency of the lattice grid .",
    "an alternative modeling choice is to equate configurations with all possible combinations of strategies that each player and its coplayers can have .",
    "an element @xmath118 of the strategy configuration space @xmath119 is comprised of the strategies of any player @xmath8 , @xmath5 , and its up to @xmath32 coplayers : @xmath120 . the strategy configuration space @xmath121 generalizes the time ",
    "dependent strategy vector @xmath117 towards all of its possible instances .",
    "hence , for @xmath0 players with two possible strategies , @xmath119 contains @xmath122 elements .",
    "if we binary code the strategies cooperation and defection ( for instance @xmath123 , @xmath124 ) , an element @xmath118 appears as binary string of length @xmath0 .",
    "note that for this case the bit  count of @xmath2 , @xmath125 , provides a simple way of expressing the fraction of cooperators @xmath126 .",
    "it is assumed that only one player or coplayer can change its strategy at a given point in time .",
    "this implies a neighborhood structure where each element @xmath2 has @xmath0 direct neighbors which are distanced by hamming distance of @xmath127 , which is denoted by @xmath128 .",
    "for instance , @xmath129 with such a model we obtain for payoff  based fitness @xmath47 a unique and static landscape @xmath130 for each player @xmath8 and each network of interaction .",
    "as the game specified by the payoff matrix ( [ eq : payoff ] ) is symmetric , the strategy landscapes @xmath131 are topologically alike for all players @xmath8 .",
    "the landscapes @xmath131 can be transformed into each other by shifting and reshuffling . for a landscape interpretation",
    "this topological likeness implies that landscape quantifiers such as the number of maxima , or correlation structure , or information content do not vary over the @xmath132 .    for @xmath133",
    ", the landscapes can be visualized in two dimensions , see fig .",
    "[ fig : n4 ] .",
    "it shows @xmath131 , @xmath134 , for the payoff matrix @xmath135 and the adjacency matrix @xmath136 specifying a pd game with a complete network of interaction and @xmath137 coplayers for each player @xmath8 .",
    "we find that @xmath67 and hence the game is static with respect to updating the network of interaction .",
    "observe that for each player there is only one maximum fitness value ( the player is defecting , while all coplayers cooperate ) and one minimum fitness value ( the player cooperates , while all coplayers defect ) .",
    "apart from the single maximum and the single minimum , there are several configurations that have the same fitness value .",
    "interestingly , these configurations do not form a neutral network ,  @xcite , as they have hamming distance of @xmath77 and hence are not direct neighbors . from the strategy landscape",
    "@xmath131 it can be concluded which strategy for the player @xmath8 ( with respect to the strategies of the coplayers ) yields the highest fitness and is therefore most desirable from the perspective of @xmath8 .",
    "nonetheless , the evolutionary path from a given initial configuration may depend on , and be influenced by , the strategies provided to and/or received from the coplayers .",
    "in addition , from the perspective of another player , another strategy configuration is best .",
    "best configurations for respective players , however , are mutually exclusive , which is a defining feature of social dilemma games such as the pd .",
    "consequently , each strategy landscape @xmath131 can be seen as a building block that constructs a strategy landscape of the game .",
    "such a game landscape would allow conclusions as to what strategy configurations are adopted if all players and their interactions are taken into account . in other words ,",
    "a game landscape may model the dynamics caused by the strategy updating processes discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : statupdate ] .",
    "reconsider the game with @xmath133 players , for which fig .",
    "[ fig : n4 ] depicts the player  wise strategy landscapes @xmath131 . at every point in time @xmath30 , the game can be seen as occupying one of its @xmath138 configurations .",
    "put another way , the actual strategy vector @xmath117 specifies an actual configuration on the landscapes @xmath131 . for each player @xmath8",
    ", its landscape @xmath131 gives its actual fitness @xmath139 .",
    "the strategy updating process means that one player provides its strategy for another player to receive .",
    "the receiving player changes its strategy . according to the landscape",
    "view this process corresponds with changing the actual configuration @xmath117 to a neighboring configuration @xmath140 .",
    "as the change of configuration affects all players ( and consequently all player  wise strategy landscapes ) , it entails that all players may experience a change of fitness as well .",
    "no player can hold onto its configuration as long as the strategy updating process is underway unless one of the two absorbing configurations @xmath141 are reached , namely @xmath142 or @xmath143 .    in the following , the strategy updating processes birth  death ( bd ) and death  birth ( db ) will be discussed .",
    "for these processes transition probabilities can be derived ,  @xcite , which can now be employed to define game landscapes .",

    "which one of the three players is the target to receive the strategy ( hence death ) is due to chance but influenced by possible restrictions regarding the replacement .",

    "[ sec : statupdate ] . note that the death probability is independent of fitness and hence the same for all configurations of each player .",
    "a bd ( and also a db ) updating does not envisage self ",
    "replacement and hence the replacement matrix @xmath51 must have diagonal elements @xmath154 . if , on the other hand , there are no replacement restrictions , then the death probability is invariant over players : @xmath155 for all players using a bd updating .",
    "assume that all players can be a target and @xmath156 is chosen .",
    "hence , the strategy configuration after the strategy updating is @xmath157 .",

    "we get the birth probability @xmath161 which is the same as the death probability ( [ eq : deathbd ] ) in bd , but the target and the source are switched in the elements of the replacement matrix .",
    "note that only if the player @xmath149 is chosen , a change in configuration takes place , that is the strategy configuration after the strategy updating is @xmath162 . put differently",
    ", the outcome of both a bd and a db updating may be the same , but the probabilities to reach it may be different .    for a sufficiently large number of strategy updating events ( and therefore changes of configuration ) , there may be some configurations that the game occupies more often than others .",
    "these may , for instance , be the absorbing configurations @xmath141 with a bit count @xmath163 and @xmath164 . analyzing whether or not these absorbing configurations are reached and how long this takes , gives rise to fixation probabilities and fixation times , which will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : fix ] . before , however , we focus on the question of how frequent any configuration is over strategy updating events .",
    "the frequency of reaching a configuration scales to the probabilities of birth and death discussed so far .",

    "the fitness of each configuration @xmath147 summarizes via a fermi function the probabilities to reach the configuration according to the birth and death events of the strategy updating process .",
    "the fitness of the game landscape therefore depends on the fitness of each player  wise landscape and possible replacement restrictions .",
    "moreover , different updating processes cast different game landscapes @xmath168 and @xmath169 out of the same strategy landscapes @xmath131 of the players @xmath8 . given that the @xmath131 are topological alike , and hence might be seen as possessing symmetry properties , different strategy updating rules break the symmetry of the player  wise strategy landscapes . at the same time , the bd and db updating processes themselves possess symmetry properties via the birth and death probabilities ( [ eq : birth ] ) and ( [ eq : death ] ) . consequently ( and in the absence of replacement restrictions ) , the game landscapes @xmath168 and @xmath169 retain symmetry properties .",
    "replacement restrictions induced by different @xmath51 , however , yield another symmetry breaking . these symmetries ( and broken symmetries ) are reflected by the landscape properties discussed in the next section .    the discussion so far has been for a constant network of interaction , that is for a specific matrix @xmath34 . as pointed out in sec .",
    "[ sec : netwupdate ] , network updating can be described by a series of adjacency matrices @xmath59 .",
    "hence , as the genetic description of the coevolutionary game comprises of the strategy vector _ and _ the network of interaction , the strategy configurations made up by the space @xmath119 could be augmented by interaction configurations built by all possible networks of interaction .",
    "consequently , the @xmath65 different interaction graphs enumerated approximately by eq .",

    "a consequence of such a modeling is that the timely order of the varying network of interaction could be interpreted as temporal neighborhoods according to the neighborhood structure inherent in landscapes . with",

    "the matrix pair @xmath176 of subsequent adjacency matrices specifies how the fitness @xmath177 relates to @xmath175 , thus constructing the transition map @xmath96 .",

    "[ fig : n5]b is for @xmath179 , and fig .",
    "[ fig : n5]c is for @xmath180 .",
    "it can be seen that the three different networks produce three different player  wise strategy landscapes for each player , which means that we indeed obtain dynamic changes over the three instances of @xmath77regular graphs on @xmath133 vertices .    comparing these strategy landscapes with those for the complete network of interactions ( see fig . [",
    "fig : n4 ] ) reveals differences .",
    "a first is that for each player , there are now two maxima and two minima .",
    "each player retains a maximum ( minimum ) if it itself defects ( cooperates ) , while its two coplayers cooperate ( defect ) .",
    "the two maxima ( minima ) come about as it makes no difference for the player s payoff whether the fourth player ( who is no coplayer as @xmath75 ) cooperates or defects .",
    "a second difference is that two neighboring configurations may build a block of equal fitness in connection with every configuration belonging to such a same  fitness block .",
    "consequently , there is neutrality in these fitness landscapes .",
    "moreover , these results suggest that the number of maxima and degree of neutrality scales to the number of coplayers , which can be confirmed by numerical experiments for landscapes with more than @xmath133 players .    within the given modeling framework of coevolutionary games , the timely order of the adjacency matrices",
    "is not associated with a particular updating process of the interaction network .",
    "the main reason is the general lack of established algebraic descriptions of network updating .",
    "the dynamic landscapes proposed may offer such an algebraic description as the transition map @xmath96 can be formulated uniquely for regular graphs , for instance for the transient between @xmath181 and @xmath182 of the example considered above as @xmath183 . for dynamic player  wise strategy landscapes @xmath184 , game landscapes for bd and db updating",
    "can be defined according to the probabilities of birth / death and expressed as dynamic counterparts of eqn .",

    "consequently , the static games landscapes ( [ eq : bd ] ) and ( [ eq : db ] ) become dynamic game landscapes : @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "these dynamic bd and db landscapes are the main topic of the numerical experiments reported in sec .",

    "[ sec : gamedynamic ] instantiate evolutionary dynamics describable by the game landscapes ( [ eq : bd ] ) and ( [ eq : db ] ) introduced above . as updating processes such as",
    "bd and db depend on random processes , the resulting game dynamics can also be seen as a stochastic process . consequently , stochastic properties such as fixation probability and fixation time have been suggested for evaluating and comparing the long  term outcome of evolutionary game dynamics , and studied widely in theory and numerical experiment , see , for instance ,  @xcite",
    ". these fixation properties particularly account for whether or not the game dynamics settles on a steady state , and if so , how long this takes on average , and how frequent it is .",
    "the fixation probability quantifies how likely it is that one of the two strategies that a player can use ( cooperate or defect ) spreads to the whole population of players , given that only one player started using this strategy .",
    "according to the landscape interpretation , this corresponds to reaching one of the two absorbing configurations @xmath141 with bit count @xmath163 and @xmath164 , given that the initial configuration @xmath191 had bit count @xmath192 and @xmath193 , respectively . for each absorbing configuration , there are @xmath0 different configurations that can possibly serve as an initial configuration .",
    "hence , as @xmath194 tends to zeros for @xmath0 getting larger , initial configurations getting scarce in the overall topological structure of the game landscape for a sufficiently large number of players . the same also applies to absorbing configurations .",
    "this is in agreement with the observation that fixation probabilities generally decrease while @xmath0 increases ( see also the results of numerical experiments in sec . [ sec : results ] ) . as there are two absorbing configurations , two distinct fixation probabilities can be defined , one for complete cooperation and another for complete defection .",
    "the probability to reach the configuration where all player cooperate , @xmath164 , is denoted by @xmath195 , while the probability of all players defecting , @xmath163 , is named @xmath196 .",
    "fixation probabilities can be analytically calculated for moran processes based on properties of markov chains for well  mixed populations ,  @xcite and numerically for games on graphs ,  @xcite . for games on graphs with replacement restrictions , estimates of the fixation probabilities using diffusion theory",
    "have been reported ,  @xcite . for coevolutionary games considering dynamic networks of interaction of varying degree ,",
    "numerical experiments can be carried out . following previous experimental works ,",
    "the fixation probabilities are approximated by the relative frequency of fixation .",
    "the fixation time quantifies how many changes in configuration it takes on average to reach an absorbing configuration @xmath141 .",
    "this corresponds with the average amount of time needed to achieve fixation .",
    "the notion of fixation time can be refined by distinguishing which one of the two absorbing configuration is reached , which gives rise to conditional fixation times ,  @xcite .",
    "the fixation times for the cooperative and defective absorbing configurations are denoted by @xmath197 and @xmath198 , respectively .    as fixation probability and fixation time are the most important quantities in stochastic game dynamics , these quantities are discussed next with respect to the landscape interpretation proposed in the previous sections .",
    "the fitness of the landscapes ( [ eq : bd ] ) and ( [ eq : db ] ) derives from payoffs of each player and summarizes the probabilities that a particular configuration is occupied by the game .",
    "hence , possible differences in fitness across neighborhoods generate topological features of the landscape .",
    "these topological features , in turn , create evolutionary paths on the landscape , which any evolutionary dynamics has to observe . however , the evolutionary dynamics is governed by a move bias towards higher fitness , which is not a move imperative . in other words",
    ", the landscape view implies that there are probabilities that the maxima are reached , but no certainties .",
    "moreover , these probabilities depend on what exactly the topological features of the landscape are , for instance , on the number of maxima , their distribution and their accessibility . for evaluating the effect of landscape features ,",
    "just focusing on the maxima is not sufficient .",
    "therefore , different types of landscape measures have been proposed which aim at reflecting , in a more general sense , the impact that landscape features have on evolutionary dynamics , see also the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : meas ] .",
    "fixation occurs if a succession of changes in configuration leads from prescribed initial configurations to the absorbing configurations .",
    "fixation probabilities @xmath199 , @xmath200 require evolutionary paths connecting initial configurations with respective absorbing configurations .",
    "the values of @xmath199 , @xmath200 scales to how easy or how difficult it is that these evolutionary paths can be accessed or distracted .",
    "the fixation time , on the other hand , varies with the length of the evolutionary path .",
    "consequently , by analyzing the topological structure of the game landscape , it may be feasible to infer fixation properties .",
    "this kind of analysis , however , is impeded by the fact that absorbing configurations in game landscapes are , topologically interpreted , non  passable points in the landscape",
    ". however , non  passable points are not a standard concept of landscapes .",
    "perhaps most similar are steady states of a landscape , but there is the difference that the evolutionary dynamics can , under certain conditions , leave a steady state and there is the even more fundamental difference that steady states are by definition maxima of the landscape .",
    "absorbing configurations may or may not be maxima of the game landscape . in the same way ,",
    "the initial configurations marking the origin of the evolutionary path may or may not be minima of the landscape . the numerical experiments discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] confirm such a characteristics for the game landscapes ( [ eq : bd ] ) and ( [ eq : db ] ) .",
    "this line of reasoning suggests that a landscape analysis should take into account that fixation properties are likely to be related to landscapes via the local ( and possibly also the global ) topological features of absorbing and initial configurations . in analogy to the landscape structure , which describes globally the topological features of the entire landscape , these topological features and their interdependences with fixation we may call absorption structure . the numerical experiments reported next section address not only topological features of the landscapes , but also the absorption structure , where the focus is on the local structures .",
    "game landscapes can only be visualized as two  dimensional projections up to @xmath133 players . for analyzing landscapes with more players , we need to resort to landscape measures . a first measure we look at",
    "is modality expressed by the number of local maxima @xmath201 . local maxima",
    "are potential steady states on the evolutionary path .",
    "hence , the number of local maxima relates to the variety of possible evolutionary paths and consequently to the complexity of the evolutionary dynamics displayed .",
    "if there is just one ( smoothly accessible ) maximum , then all evolutionary paths converge to it and the evolutionary dynamics displayed is rather simple . if , on the other hand , there is a large number of maxima , then the possible evolutionary paths may differ from each other massively resulting in more complex evolutionary dynamics . for a landscape",
    "@xmath202 a configuration @xmath2 is a local maximum @xmath203 , if @xmath204 , the fitness of this strategy configuration satisfies @xmath205 .",
    "moreover , if this condition holds @xmath206 , then @xmath203 is a global maximum .    for evaluating the local absorption structure , we need to consider three further local topological features : minimum , neutrality , and saddles .",
    "a local minimum @xmath207 has at least one neighbor that has a smaller fitness and no neighbors that have larger fitness than itself .",
    "a neutral configuration @xmath208 has only neighbors with the same fitness , which means that landscape area containing @xmath208 and its neighbors is flat .",
    "lastly , a saddle @xmath209 has some neighbors that are larger and some other neighbors that are smaller . in numerical experiments ,",
    "the number of local maxima @xmath201 can be computed for the game landscapes ( [ eq : bd ] ) and ( [ eq : db ] ) .",
    "the same applies to whether the absorbing configuration @xmath141 and its initial configurations @xmath210 are maxima , minima , neutral or saddles .",
    "consequently , for the dynamic instances of these landscapes , a time series containing the numbers of local maxima @xmath211 is obtained .",
    "the same applies to all other measures of dynamic landscapes .",
    "there are two immediate problems with analyzing landscapes by modality expressed by the number of local maxima @xmath201 .",
    "first , on a practical level , we find that @xmath201 can only be calculated by enumeration , which entails the proverbial curse of dimensionality .",
    "second , on a conceptual level , there is the fact that the pure number of local maxima is a decisive ( and arguable the most important ) factor defining evolutionary paths , but the distribution of the maxima and their accessibility is also profoundly influential . to overcome these issues , other types of measure have been proposed for quantifying smoothness , ruggedness , or neutrality of the landscape .",
    "two of them are studied here , correlation length @xmath212 and information content @xmath213 .",
    "the correlation length evaluates across the landscape how strongly the fitness of any configuration relates to the fitness of neighboring configurations and hence is a measure of the landscape s ruggedness ,  @xcite . for calculating the correlation length @xmath212 , a random walk on the landscape of length @xmath19",
    "the fitness values for each step on the walk are recorded by the sequence @xmath214 and thus a series of neighboring fitness relations is obtained .",
    "assuming that the landscape is isotropic , these neighboring fitness relations account for general changes in fitness across the landscape .",
    "hence , the autocorrelation of sequence ( [ eq : seq ] ) with time lag @xmath215 defines the landscape s random walk correlation function @xmath216 , where @xmath217 , @xmath218 and @xmath219 .",
    "the function @xmath220 measures the correlation between different regions of the fitness landscape and expresses a measure of how smooth or rugged the landscape is .",
    "the correlation length @xmath221 derives from the autocorrelation @xmath222 of time lag @xmath223 ,  @xcite .",
    "the information content @xmath213 ,  @xcite , is an entropic landscape measure , which also uses the fitness sequence ( [ eq : seq ] ) generated by a random walk on the landscape .",
    "it can be interpreted as a measure of the amount of information required to reconstruct the landscape structure . from the time series ( [ eq : seq ] ) , differences in fitness between two consecutive walking steps are coded by symbols @xmath224 , @xmath225 , taken from the set @xmath226 .",
    "these symbols are obtained by @xmath227 for a fixed @xmath228 $ ] , where @xmath229 is the maximum difference between two fitness values .",
    "the obtained symbols are concatenated to a string @xmath230 the parameter @xmath231 defines the sensitivity by which the string @xmath232 accounts for differences in the fitness values .",
    "for example , if @xmath233 , the string @xmath232 contains the symbol zero only for the random walk reaching a strictly flat area . hence , @xmath233 discriminates very sensitively between increasing and decreasing fitness values .",
    "by contrast , for @xmath234 , the string only contains the symbol zero , which makes evaluating the structure of the landscape pointless .",
    "a fixed value of @xmath231 with @xmath235 defines a level of detail with respect to the information gained about the landscape structure .",
    "the string ( [ eq : entstring ] ) represents this information depending on @xmath231 and codes it by subblocks over the set @xmath236 . in other words ,",

    "a main observation is that replacement restrictions modify the game landscapes , which is also shown by the landscape measures .",
    "for instance , the number of local maxima @xmath201 for the pd game with @xmath264 and db updating is no longer strictly unimodal ( compare figs . [",
    "fig : modal]a and [ fig : mod_rest]a ) .",
    "interestingly , for bd updating , even replacement restrictions do not alter unimodality .",
    "for the sd game , the inverse proportionality between @xmath201 and @xmath33 ceases , and generally the number of local maxima does vary more strongly for different networks of interaction .",
    "these characteristics can also be seen for the landscape measures correlation length @xmath212 ( see fig . [",

    "a first feature is that for both games , both parameter values of @xmath19 and both absorbing configurations , the absorption structure of bd updating generally differs from db updating .",
    "this may answer the question of why game landscapes that are symmetric with respect to bd and db for no replacement restrictions yield fixation properties that do differ from bd to db .",
    "a possible explanation is that while the game landscapes are topologically the same as shown by the landscape measures @xmath212 and @xmath213 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : correl ] and @xmath280 ) , their absorption structure is not .",
    "this suggests the absorption structure to be a determining factor in the relationships between game landscapes and fixation .",
    "a second feature is that for all settings tested there is rarely a variety over the number of players and coplayers . in other words , within a given game setting changing the number of players and coplayers does not alter the absorption structure .",
    "an exception to that rule is the initial structure of the defective configuration and @xmath265 , which intermixes a saddle and maximum / minimum .",
    "though , the maximum / minimum is only for two cases , namely @xmath133 with @xmath137 and @xmath285 with @xmath298 , that is the well  mixed cases for a rather small number of players .",
    "a third feature is a general absence of variety over different interaction matrices @xmath59 .",
    "at least for the interaction matrices tested , the absorption structure is largely invariant over interaction networks .",
    "there is an exception with the sd game , @xmath264 and db updating to be discussed later .",
    "before , two further features can be noted .",
    "the maxima / minima of the absorption structure are mostly global , with exception of the cooperative absorption structure and @xmath265 .",
    "finally , it can be observed that the absorption structure is inverse complementary for bd and db , the meaning of which is that if there is a maximum for bd , then db has a minimum , and vice versa , while a saddle remains a saddle .",
    "this follows from the symmetry properties via the birth and death probabilities ( [ eq : birth ] ) and ( [ eq : death ] ) as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : gameland ] .",
    "there is again , however , an interesting exception in form of the sd game with @xmath264 . for this game setting , we find that the cooperative final absorbing configuration is neutral for bd updating , and a combination of maximal , minimal and neutral for db updating .",
    "further analysis shows that these topological features vary over @xmath0 , @xmath33 and @xmath59 . for most @xmath0 and @xmath33 the absorbing configuration is neutral , while for a few @xmath0 and @xmath33",
    "it is either a maximum or a minimum . in these cases ,",
    "the topological features are fixed for varying interaction networks .",
    "in addition , there are @xmath0 and @xmath33 for which varying interaction networks give either a mixture of maxima and neutral , or a mixture of minima and neutral . for the defective absorbing structure ,",
    "the initial configurations vary over @xmath59 , where for most @xmath0 and @xmath33 we have neutrality , while for some other @xmath0 and @xmath33 there is a mix of neutral and maxima .",
    "numerical evaluation affirms that such a variety of the topological features of the absorption structure over interaction networks can be observed for other game settings as well , particularly those on the line @xmath299 .",

    "the lines connecting the markers are depicted to ease following trends .",
    "the pearson product  moment correlation coefficient is calculated to aggregate over interaction networks and the number of players @xmath0 for each number of coplayers @xmath33 .",
    "the advantages of such a mode of calculation are that the database for analyzing correlations becomes sufficiently large ( it comprised of data for the instance of interaction matrices @xmath59 times the number of players @xmath0 ) and that trends over a varying number of players are captured",
    ". however , there should be an awareness that the calculation implicitly assumes that fixation properties and landscape measures scale on @xmath0 in ways compatible with the dependence on @xmath59 .    comparing the results in figs .",
    "[ fig : corr_l_coop ] and [ fig : corr_i_coop ] tells us that the correlations between @xmath212 and either @xmath195 or @xmath197 are volatile and hardly evaluable , while for @xmath213 there are clear trends .",
    "the same can be said about the defective fixation , see figs .",
    "[ fig : corr_l_def ] and [ fig : corr_i_def ] for @xmath196 and @xmath198 .",
    "further analysis ( not shown in a figure ) confirms this to remain if the calculation is done for each @xmath0 and @xmath33 .",
    "hence , it appears to be justified to conclude that the information content @xmath213 correlates more clearly to fixation properties than the correlation length @xmath212 .",
    "another results ( also not shown in a figure for brevity reasons ) shows that the number of local maxima @xmath201 correlates poorly to fixation properties .",
    "apart from the fact that there is no correlation for the pd game , bd updating and the fixation of cooperation as @xmath303 , there are further results to note . for @xmath304 ,",
    "the correlations are always zeros .",
    "this is why : with the experimental setup employed ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : setup ] ) only for @xmath272 , there can be @xmath304 , with the additionally meaning that such a game is well  mixed with just one instance of the interaction matrix @xmath34 . as correlation",
    "can not be based on a single data pair , the correlation must be zero .",
    "furthermore , it can be seen that there is a negative correlation between @xmath213 and @xmath195 ( and @xmath196 ) , while the correlation between @xmath213 and @xmath197 ( and @xmath198 ) is positive .",
    "this appears reasonable as the fixation probabilities fall with increasing number of players @xmath0 , yet the fixation times grow .",
    "also , it can be observed that generally the correlations are strongest for small number of players and weaken before they reach zero for @xmath304 .    regarding the shaping and typifying effect of absorption ,",
    "the following can be observed comparing the local absorption structure in tab .",
    "[ tab : absorp ] with the correlations in figs .",
    "[ fig : corr_i_coop ] and [ fig : corr_i_def ] . from a topological point of view",
    "the correlation should be particularly strong if the absorbing configuration is a maximum and the initial configurations are all minima .",
    "for absorbing and initial configurations being minima and maxima , the opposite should apply . only for one example , the final absorbing configuration is a maximum and the initial configurations are minima for all @xmath0 , @xmath33 and @xmath59 : the defective absorption of the sd game with @xmath264 . for this case ,",
    "the correlation between @xmath213 and @xmath196 is indeed slightly stronger than for the other cases .",
    "however , for the correlation between @xmath213 and @xmath198 the opposite is true . in general",
    ", it can be noted that the correlations for all settings ( except pd - bd for the cooperative absorption ) are clearly visible and rather similar .",
    "it can be concluded that while there are some hints in the local absorption structure to clarify the correlations between landscape measures and fixation properties , the explanatory framework should not be overstretched .",
    "analogous to a landscape analysis that only focuses on selected points in the landscape ( for instance the maxima / minima ) , the local absorption structure only captures a subset of the topological structures that shape coevolutionary game dynamics .",
    "therefore , extensions toward a global absorption structure seem desirable",
    ".    a last set of experiments reports correlations between landscape measures and network measures of the interaction matrices @xmath59 . figs . [ fig : corr_matrix1][fig : corr_matrix3 ] give the correlations between information content @xmath213 and either graph energy , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ener ] ) , independence number , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ind ] ) , algebraic connectivity , eq .",
    "( [ eq : conn ] ) , or expander index , eq .",
    "( [ eq : expan ] ) .",
    "again , the pearson coefficient is used aggregating over interaction networks and the number of players @xmath0 for each number of coplayers @xmath33 .",
    "the same color code for the game settings as for the correlations with fixation properties is used .",
    "it can be seen that the information content correlates well to all networks measures , and there are small differences between the landscapes with @xmath264 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : corr_matrix1 ] ) and @xmath265 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : corr_matrix2 ] ) .",
    "it is conspicuous that the results are indistinguishable for bd and db landscapes , which fully reflects the symmetry properties of these landscapes .",
    "the symmetry is broken by replacements restrictions .",
    "the correlations between the network measures and @xmath213 for @xmath264 and replacement restrictions reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr_matrix3 ] confirm this as there are differences between bd and db .",
    "the correlations , however , are less smooth over @xmath33 as compared to the results in figs .",
    "[ fig : corr_matrix1 ] and [ fig : corr_matrix2 ] , which is most likely due to the additional stochastic nature of replacement restrictions .",
    "lastly , two more observations can be noted .",
    "a first is that the correlations between @xmath213 and the networks measures are negative for graphs energy , independence number and expander index , while they are positive for algebraic connectivity .",
    "the main reason is that amongst the network measures studied only algebraic connectivity increases continuously for @xmath33 getting larger in both mean and variance over instances of the interaction matrices @xmath59 .",
    "a second is that for the graph energy and the expander index the correlations are weak for both small numbers of coplayers ( @xmath305 ) before they get stronger to weaken again for larger number of players ( @xmath306 ) . for the other two network measures the weakening is only for @xmath306 , which is similar to the correlations with fixation properties .",
    "the results given above set out relationships between landscape measures and both fixation properties and network properties , and argue that dynamic landscape models of coevolutionary games are viable . in this section ,",
    "features and implications of such a modeling approach are discussed and some concluding observations are offered .    1 .   an essential part of the experimental study is the study of correlations between landscape measures and both fixation properties and quantifiers of the networks of interaction .",
    "the main results are that information content scales much better to fixation properties and network measures than the other landscape measures considered .",
    "particularly ruggedness as measured by the correlation length relates less clearly and much weaker to fixation properties than information content , which is understood to account not specifically for ruggedness , but more for the interplay between smooth , rugged and flat landscape areas .",
    "hence , a conclusion may be that also for game landscapes ruggedness alone is not a good predictor for evolutionary dynamics , as also reported for other types of fitness landscapes ,  @xcite .",
    "as there are additional entropic landscape measures based on the information content , for instance partial information content , information stability or density  basin information ,  @xcite , it might be interesting to study whether these measures also scale well for game landscapes and may offer further insight into game dynamics .",
    "regarding the correlations between landscape measures and quantifiers of interaction networks , the results are more consistent .",
    "there are clear correlations for all four of the network measures considered , with algebraic connectivity and independence number scaling slightly better than graph energy and expander index .",
    "however , it should be noted that the correlations established between the landscape measures and network measures are based on the laplacian or adjacency spectra of the adjacency matrix @xmath34 . as these spectra do not uniquely",
    "determine the interaction graph , there might be correlations between the graph structure of the interaction network and the game landscape that are not captured .",
    "the discussion might be extendable by considering alternatives , for instance generalized graph distance measures as reported by  @xcite .",
    "the experiments studying the effect of different networks of interaction with given @xmath0 and @xmath33 on fixation properties and landscape measures only report mean , maximum , and minimum values and their interdependencies .",
    "further statistical analysis , for instance considering variances , or higher  order moments , or estimates of the underlying distribution , are deliberately omitted .",
    "the main argument is that we should beware of drawing conclusions based on such a far  reaching statistical analysis as it is not clear what it might really signify .",
    "for instance , for @xmath75 coplayers , the number of different graphs can be enumerated exactly by eq .",
    "( [ eq:2regular ] ) .",
    "the experiments presented are for up to @xmath272 players .",
    "accordingly , at the upper limit of the experimental setup , we find @xmath307 . there is no alternative but to conclude that any number of numerically testable networks of interaction represents just a tiny subset of all interaction networks . at the same time it is far from being clear",
    "how well the finite number of graphs generated by the numerical procedures represent all possible different graphs for given @xmath0 and @xmath33 .",
    "thus , it might be possible that some trends are biased by the algorithmic process of numerically generating interaction networks @xmath34 .",
    "further work is needed to clarify these interdependencies .",
    "3 .   the experimental results showing landscape measures and their correlations to fixation properties as well as to graph  theoretical quantities of the interaction networks are for the specific algebraic description of the game landscapes ( [ eq : bd ] ) and ( [ eq : db ] ) .",
    "the algebraic form of how to cumulate death and birth probabilities from the player  wise strategy landscapes is definatory and was employed as it fitted well to fixation properties and previous results known about social dilemma game dynamics .",
    "it is an open question whether an alternative algebraic form of ( [ eq : bd ] ) and ( [ eq : db ] ) can achieve similar or even better results .",
    "similarly , the results obtained here are specific for the linear relation @xmath48 .",
    "hence , it might be interesting to analyze how different payoff  to  fitness relations modify the results , for instance the exponential relations @xmath308 or @xmath309 , as suggested by  @xcite .",
    "this may go along with experimental studies of different levels of the intensity of selection @xmath310 , which is also opened up by the game landscape approach proposed in this paper . in the case of weak selection , that is for @xmath311 , the player  wise strategy landscapes lose their distinct topological features , which yields ( in the absence of replacement restrictions ) a game landscape that is neutral .",
    "consequently , the game dynamics on this landscape would be random drift . for larger or large values of @xmath310",
    "the topological features of the player  wise strategy landscapes become more prominent , for which the game landscape is more rugged . from this line of argument",
    "it can be conjectured that there is a direct relation between the intensity of selection and the ruggedness of the game landscape , which might be verifiable by future studies .",
    "the results presented are for up to @xmath272 players .",
    "if the trends identified in these results remain valid for a larger number of players needs to be studied in future work .",
    "a limitation in these studies surely is that the number of configurations to be analyzed in the landscapes increases exponentially with the number of players , hence setting bounds as to how far such experiments might be extendable .",
    "therefore , with the computational resources currently available the modeling framework is likely to be confined to a moderate number of players .",
    "however , for an increased number of players there is the framework of replicator dynamics which sufficiently describes game dynamics for populations becoming large ,  @xcite .",
    "some primary experiments have shown that for replacement restrictions , the correlation between landscape measures on the one hand , and fixations and network properties on the other , cease .",
    "apparently , the replacement restrictions seriously modify the structure of the game landscapes .",
    "it is another open question if these relationships can be reestablished by taking into account properties of the replacement process , for instance the absorption structure of the restricted network .",
    "this may be extended by foregoing the setting that the degree of the replacement matrix @xmath51 matches the degree of the adjacency matrix @xmath34 .",
    "coevolutionary games cast players that update their strategies as well as their networks of interaction . in this study ,",
    "a reinterpretation of coevolutionary games as dynamic fitness landscapes is proposed .",
    "the dynamic landscapes are based on three major components : ( i ) a description of strategy updating as a moran process with definable probabilities of strategy transitions , ( ii ) a formulation of network of interaction updating as instances of random regular graphs , and ( iii ) a linear relation between payoff and fitness . using these components , payoff  related fitness landscapes",
    "can be defined for each player .",
    "it is further shown that coevolutionary game dynamics can be expressed by a game landscape derived from these player  wise landscapes by including the strategy updating process . moreover ,",
    "different strategy updating processes , such as death  birth ( db ) or birth  death ( bd ) produce different game landscapes , which can be seen as strategy updating breaking the symmetry of the play  wise landscapes . in numerical experiments",
    "it has been demonstrated that landscape measures such as modality , ruggedness and information content allow to differentiate between different game landscapes .",
    "fixation probabilities and fixation times have been calculated as well as network measures characterizing the networks of interaction of the coevolutionary games . by correlation analysis",
    "it has been shown how the landscape measures relate to both fixation properties and network measures .",
    "the approach presented is a technique for analyzing coevolutionary games by landscapes .",
    "moreover , the approach is not restricted to moran processes as long as strategy transition probabilities can be derived , at least approximately .",
    "finally , networks updating is currently modeled as a given sequence of random regular graphs , but should be understood as a transition process , for instance by using reproducing graphs ,  @xcite as a tool to refine the description of transitions between adjacency matrices .",
    "different settings of the game represented by the numeric values of the payoff matrix and different rules of the strategy updating result into a large variety of coevolutionary game dynamics .",
    "a considerable number of works have analyzed and discussed this game dynamics with respect to fixation properties such as fixation probability and fixation time from both a theoretical as well as an experimental point of view ,  @xcite .",
    "the results reported here contribute to this discussion by offering a fitness landscape view as an alternative explanatory framework .",
    "in other words , by the approach presented coevolutionary games may become amenable to be analyzed by dynamic landscapes .",
