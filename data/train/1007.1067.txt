    "heavy - ion reactions near the coulomb barrier provide a good opportunity to investigate an interplay between the reaction process and internal excitations in the colliding nuclei .",
    "for example , it is well known that subbarrier fusion cross sections are significantly enhanced as compared to a prediction of a simple barrier penetration model because of the couplings of the relative motion between the colliding nuclei to nuclear intrinsic degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "it has been well recognized by now that the enhancement of fusion cross sections can be explained in terms of a distribution of coulomb barrier heights originated from the couplings @xcite .",
    "the barrier distribution can be actually extracted directly from the experimental data by taking the second derivative of the product of fusion cross section @xmath2 and the center of mass energy @xmath3 with respect to @xmath3 , that is , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the experimental data have clearly shown that the barrier distribution makes a useful representation to understand the reaction dynamics of heavy - ion subbarrier fusion reactions @xcite .",
    "a similar concept of barrier distribution has been applied also to heavy - ion quasi - elastic scattering ( that is , a sum of elastic , inelastic scattering , and transfer reactions ) @xcite . in this case , the barrier distribution is defined as the first derivative of the ratio of the quasi - elastic scattering cross section at a backward angle @xmath5 to the rutherford cross section @xmath6 , that is , @xmath7 .",
    "the fusion and quasi - elastic barrier distributions have been found to behave similarly to each other at least in a qualitative way @xcite .    in order to analyse the subbarrier enhancement of fusion cross sections and fusion and quasi - elastic barrier distributions ,",
    "the coupled - channels method has been successfully employed .",
    "typically , a few low - lying collective excitations are taken into account in a calculation@xcite . with this approach ,",
    "the barrier distribution arises naturally through the eigen - channel representation @xcite .",
    "recently , however , a few experimental data which can not be accounted for by the conventional coupled - channels calculation have been obtained @xcite .",
    "one of these examples is the quasi - elastic scattering experiment for the @xmath8 systems @xcite .",
    "the experimental data show that the quasi - elastic barrier distribution for these systems behaves in a significantly different way from each other : the barrier distribution for the @xmath0ne+@xmath9 system is much more smeared than that for the @xmath0ne+@xmath10 system @xcite . on the other hand , the coupled - channels calculations that take into account the collective rotational excitations in @xmath0ne as well as the vibrational excitations in @xmath1zr lead to similar barrier distributions for both systems , because the strongly deformed @xmath11 nucleus mainly determines the barrier structure while the difference in the collective excitations in the two zr targets plays a minor role . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was suggested that single - particle excitations in the colliding nuclei are responsible for smearing the barrier distribution for the @xmath0ne + @xmath12zr system .",
    "notice that the single - particle excitations are expected to be much more important for the @xmath9 nucleus compared to the @xmath10 nucleus , which has the @xmath13 shell closure .",
    "in fact , while there are only 12 states in the @xmath14zr nucleus up to 4 mev , there are 53 known states in the @xmath12zr nucleus @xcite . for 5 mev ,",
    "the number of known states is 35 and 87 for @xmath14zr and @xmath12zr , respectively ( for another nucleus , @xmath15sn , there are 81 known levels up to 3.9 mev and 112 levels up to 4.3 mev @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of low - lying single - particle excitations on low - energy heavy - ion reactions , as conjectured in ref .",
    "@xcite . in order to understand qualitatively the effect of non - collective excitations , in this paper we shall use a schematic model , that is , one - dimensional barrier penetration in the presence of the couplings to intrinsic degrees of freedom .",
    "the single - particle degrees of freedom can be described in several ways @xcite .",
    "for instance , ref.@xcite used the lindblad approach to discuss the role of quantum decoherence in deep subbarier hinderance of fusion cross sections . in this paper",
    ", we employ the random matrix theory ( rmt ) to describe the single - particle excitations ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews on rmt ) . the random matrix approach for heavy - ion reactions has been developed in 1970 s by weidenmller and his collaborators in order to analyse heavy - ion deep inelastic collisions ( dic ) @xcite . at that time",
    ", they derived the transport coefficients based on rmt @xcite and solved the classical transport equations ( see also refs .",
    "the rmt has also been employed to discuss quantum dissipation @xcite . in this paper , instead of solving the classical equations , we directly solve the coupled - channels equations quantum mechanically by including the single - particle excitations described by rmt .",
    "our approach is therefore similar to that in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the coupled - channels equations with 200 dimension were solved for a one - dimensional model using a semi - classical approximation .",
    "in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , we apply our formalism to the subbarrier regime without using the semi - classical approximation .",
    "this will enable us to assess the effect of single - particle excitations on quantum tunneling and thus on the barrier distribution . by treating the single - particle states explicitly ,",
    "we can also discuss the excitation spectra as a function of incident energy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we detail the coupled - channels formalism with single - particle excitations described by rmt . in sec .",
    "iii , we apply the formalism to one - dimensional models for quantum tunneling .",
    "we discuss the effect of single - particle excitations on the barrier penetrability , the barrier distribution , and the excitation spectra . using the results for the one - dimensional model",
    ", we also discuss the effect of non - collective excitations on quasi - elastic barrier distribution for the @xmath0ne+@xmath12zr system .",
    "we then summarize the paper in sec .",
    "the aim of this paper is to discuss the effect of single - particle excitations on one - dimensional barrier penetrability . for this purpose , we assume the following hamiltonian : @xmath16 here , @xmath17 is the reduced mass and @xmath18 is a potential for the relative motion .",
    "@xmath19 is a hamiltonian for the intrinsic degrees of freedom of the colliding nuclei , and the last term , @xmath20 , is a coupling hamiltonian between the relative motion and the internal degrees of freedom .",
    "the coupled - channels equations for this hamiltonian are obtained by expanding the total wave function in terms of the eigen functions of @xmath19 and read , @xmath21 here , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the excitation energy and the wave function for the @xmath24-th channel , respectively .",
    "@xmath25 is a coupling matrix and is a function of the coordinate @xmath26 .",
    "the coupled - channels equations are solved by imposing the boundary conditions of @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the wave number for the @xmath24-th channel , and 0 represents the entrance channel .",
    "we have assumed that the projectile is incident from the right hand side of the potential barrier . with the transmission coefficients @xmath29 ,",
    "the penetration probability for the inclusive process is calculated as @xmath30 the barrier distribution is obtained by taking the derivative of @xmath31 , that is , @xmath32 @xcite .    in order to take into account the single - particle excitations , as we will show in the next section",
    ", one has to include a large number of channels .",
    "since it is time and memory consuming to solve the coupled - channels equations with a large dimensionality , in this paper we employ a constant coupling approximation @xcite . in this approximation ,",
    "the coupling matrix is assumed to be a constant over the whole range of @xmath26 .",
    "then , one can diagonalize the matrix @xmath33 with a coordinate independent unitary matrix @xmath34 , @xmath35 where , @xmath36 are the eigenvalues of @xmath37 . transforming the channel wave functions as @xmath38",
    "the coupled - channels equations are transformed to a set of the uncoupled equations , @xmath39 we call the transformed channels the eigen - channels and , for each eigen - channel , @xmath40 the eigen - potential .    the boundary conditions for @xmath41 are given by @xmath42 and @xmath43 where the reflection and transmission coefficients are related to the original coefficients in eqs .",
    "( [ bc1 ] ) and ( [ bc2 ] ) by @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively . here",

    "for the collective excitations , we assume either the vibrational or the rotational couplings .",
    "the coupling matrix for the vibrational coupling is given by @xmath53 if we truncate the phonon space up to 1-phonon state @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath54 is a coupling constant , and we have assumed the linear coupling . for the rotational coupling ,",
    "the coupling matrix is given by @xmath55 up to the @xmath56 state in the rotational band@xcite , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the quadrupole and hexadecapole coupling strengths , respectively .",
    "for the single - particle excitations , we consider an ensemble of coupling matrix elements based on the random matrix theory @xcite .",
    "we assume that the matrix elements are uncorrelated random numbers obeying a gaussian distribution with zero mean .",
    "that is , we require that the first and the second moments of the coupling matrix elements satisfy the following equations @xcite @xmath59 where the overbar denotes an ensemble average and @xmath60 is the nuclear level density . here",
    ", we have assumed the coordinate independent matrix elements according to the constant coupling approximation .    for the single - particle excitations , we generate the coupling matrix elements according to these equations many times . for each coupling matrix",
    ", we do not vary the matrix elements for the collective excitations , which are uniquely determined once the coupling is specified . for each coupling matrix , we solve the coupled - channels equations and calculate the penetrability and the reflection probability .",
    "the physical results are then obtained by taking an average of these quantities .    in the actual calculations shown in the next section , we discretize the quasi - continuum single - particle spectrum in the coupled - channels equations @xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) . introducing the level density @xmath60 ,    @xmath61    the coupled - channels equation can be written in the following form : @xmath62 in this equation , we assume a quasi - continuum spectrum for the single - particle excited states , and discretize the integral with a constant energy spacing , @xmath63 . for the ground state and the collective excitation channels ,",
    "we then obtain , @xmath64 while for the single - particle channels denoted by @xmath22 we obtain @xmath65 here , @xmath66 sp denotes a summation over the ground state and the collective channels , while @xmath67 sp a summation over the single - particle channels .",
    "these equations can be expressed in a simpler way by multiplying a factor @xmath68 for each index @xmath22 representing the single - particle channels .",
    "that is , @xmath69 with these wave functions and the coupling matrix elements , eqs . ( [ cceq3 ] ) and ( [ cceq4 ] ) read , @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively . from eqs .",
    "( [ bc1 ] ) and ( [ bc2 ] ) , the boundary conditions for @xmath72 are given by @xmath73 and @xmath74 where , @xmath75 and @xmath76 the penetrability is then given by @xmath77    this method with a constant energy step considerably reduces the computation time as compared to the case of treating the exponentially increasing number of single - particle levels as they are .",
    "it also validates the use of the random matrix theory .",
    "an important assumption in rmt is that the ensemble average of a quantity is equivalent to the energy average of that quantity over the spectrum @xcite . in our case",
    ", we expect that the ensemble average of the calculated results corresponds to the energy average of the same quantities within the energy spacing of @xmath63 .",
    "we now numerically solve the coupled - channels equations and discuss the effect of single - particle excitations on barrier penetrability .",
    "we first consider the vibrational coupling .",
    "we assume that there is a collective vibrational state at 1 mev , whose coupling to the ground state is given by eq .",
