    "understanding the sensitivity of outcomes to initial conditions in certain iterative algorithms is important for the design and analysis of many physical systems .",
    "example algorithms include iterative methods used in linear algebra , interior - point methods of convex optimization , and polynomial zero finding @xcite .",
    "various condition numbers have been defined as a measure of the sensitivity of the solutions with respect to small perturbations of the input .",
    "one of the earliest studies by turin @xcite on iterative algorithms related to matrix inversion and the solution of large systems of linear equations defined two such condition numbers as a measure of the degree of ill - conditioning in a matrix . in particular , for a matrix @xmath12 , the first was referred to as the @xmath13-condition number , defined as @xmath14 with @xmath15 representing the frobenius norm , whilst the second was referred to as the @xmath16-condition number , defined as @xmath17 with @xmath18 denoting the operator returning the largest absolute entry of the matrix .",
    "however , probably the best known condition number , introduced in @xcite , takes the form @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 denotes the 2-norm .",
    "this condition number , similar to the @xmath13-condition number and @xmath16-condition number , is important in problems involving matrix inversion and solutions of linear equations .    as conjectured in @xcite , the calculation of a condition number pertaining to a problem with a certain deterministic data set",
    "is as hard as solving the problem itself with the data set . whilst very difficult to prove in general , a proof of this conjecture has been established for _ conic _ condition numbers in @xcite . to gain further insights into the behavior of the condition number ,",
    "probabilistic analysis based on certain probability measures on the data has been employed ; see @xcite for a partial list .",
    "in general , most existing literature dealing with the probabilistic analysis of condition numbers has focused on one of two main perspectives .",
    "the first is to establish bounds on the tail of the distribution of @xmath22 , which is important for the geometrical characterization of the condition number @xcite .",
    "central to the geometric characterization is the fact that @xmath22 is proportional to the reciprocal of the distance to the set of ill - conditioned matrices @xcite .",
    "the second has been to establish bounds on the expectation of @xmath23 , which is important for characterizing the average loss of numerical precision and average running time @xcite of iterative algorithms . in general , the `` randomness '' of the condition number",
    "is introduced by selecting the elements of @xmath24 to be standard independent normal real / complex random variables @xcite .",
    "whilst in this paper we focus primarily on a probabilistic analysis , it is worth noting that a deterministic version of the problems considered above , related to the inversion of positive - definite hankel ( or moment ) matrices appearing naturally in random matrix theory , involves the determination of the smallest eigenvalues of hankel matrices of order @xmath8 .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for contributions dealing with this problem .",
    "demmel , in his seminal paper @xcite , introduced a new condition number of _ conic _ type , defined for square @xmath25 matrix * a * as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the frobenius norm .",
    "this , along with a theorem due to eckart and young @xcite , permits a geometrical characterization @xcite , which has enabled the calculation of bounds on the tail distribution of @xmath28 with the help of integral geometry .",
    "a random variable similar to @xmath29 also arises in problems dealing with the entanglement of a bi - partite quantum system @xcite . as demonstrated in @xcite ,",
    "the condition numbers arising in various contexts , including matrix inversion , eigenvalue calculation , polynomial zero finding , as well as pole assignment in linear control systems , can be bounded by @xmath28 .",
    "the definition ( [ dcn ] ) extends naturally to rectangular matrices by replacing @xmath30 in ( [ dcn ] ) with @xmath31 ( also known as the moore - penrose inverse or the pseudo - inverse ) to yield @xmath32 for @xmath0 with @xmath33 , ( [ dcn1 ] ) simplifies to @xmath34 where @xmath35 are the non - zero eigenvalues of @xmath36 ( or @xmath37 with @xmath4 denoting conjugate - transpose . in this paper",
    ", we deal exclusively with gaussian random matrices @xmath0 ( @xmath38 ) having independent complex standard normal entries .",
    "therefore , ( [ dcngen ] ) can be written as @xmath39 which follows from the fact that the matrix @xmath36 is positive - definite with probability one @xcite .",
    "this form of the demmel condition number was used by krishnaiah _ et .",
    "_ in a sequence of papers @xcite to derive the inferences on certain sub - hypotheses when the total hypothesis , which is composed of various component sub - hypotheses , is rejected .",
    "recently , it was shown in @xcite that the condition number of the form ( [ dcn1 ] ) is useful in analyzing the loss of precision in the computation of the solution to the classical linear least squares problem .",
    "also , the statistical properties of the demmel condition number @xmath28 ( for arbitrary @xmath9 and @xmath8 ) have recently found important applications in the design and analysis of contemporary wireless communication systems .",
    "specific examples include the design of adaptive multi - antenna transmission techniques @xcite , and the modeling of physical multi - antenna transmission channels @xcite .    from the discussion given above",
    ", there is clear motivation for studying the statistical properties of the demmel condition number of random matrices .",
    "here we review some of the key existing contributions dealing with this problem .",
    "these contributions include @xcite , which investigated the exact distributions as well as bounds on the tail probabilities over various regimes depending on the size of the random matrix .",
    "for instance , demmel showed that for gaussian matrices @xmath20 @xcite , @xmath40 while edelman concluded that as @xmath41 @xcite , @xmath42 for gaussian matrices @xmath43 with @xmath38 , one could also exploit the bound @xmath44 ( following from the fact that @xmath45 ) along with the upper bound on the distribution tail of @xmath22 given in ( * ? ? ? * theorem 4.6 ) to derive an upper bound on the distribution tail of @xmath28 .",
    "this , in turn , reveals that the @xmath46 asymptotic scaling order observed in @xcite for square gaussian matrices also serves as an upper bound on the scaling order for rectangular gaussian matrices .",
    "the exact scaling order , however , has yet to be determined .",
    "in addition to these results , more recently , various exact closed - form expressions for the distribution of the demmel condition number for gaussian matrices @xmath43 have been reported in @xcite . these results , however , are rather complicated and they become unwieldy computationally when the matrix dimensions are not small . moreover , the expressions in @xcite are not suitable for understanding the behavior of the scaled demmel condition number as the matrix dimensions grow large . in this respect , only for the case",
    "@xmath11 given in @xcite , the asymptotic behavior of the exact probability density function ( p.d.f . ) of the demmel condition number is known . establishing the asymptotic properties for more general @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) matrices is one of the key objectives to be addressed in this paper .",
    "in addition to @xmath28 , other related metrics of the form @xmath49 have been considered by krishnaiah _ et .",
    "_ @xcite in certain hypothesis testing problems .",
    "therein , they employed a result due to davis @xcite , which gives an expression for the p.d.f .",
    "of @xmath50 by establishing a laplace transform relationship with respect to the p.d.f .  of @xmath51",
    "however , the expressions obtained are very complicated , both analytically and numerically .",
    "this complexity , in turn , does not easily facilitate the understanding of the asymptotic behavior of the p.d.f .  as the matrix dimensions become large . in this paper",
    ", we tackle this problem by adopting a different approach , making use of techniques developed in @xcite .",
    "we focus our analysis on the quantities , @xmath52 and @xmath53 whilst noting that our approach may also pave the way for studying more generalized metrics of the form @xmath54 .",
    "we derive new expressions for the exact and asymptotic distributions of @xmath52 and @xmath55 for gaussian matrices @xmath43 ( @xmath38 ) by adopting a moment generating function ( m.g.f . )",
    "based approach .",
    "we show the interesting result that both @xmath52 and @xmath56 scale on the order of @xmath10 when @xmath9 and @xmath8 tend to infinity in such a way that @xmath57 remains a fixed integer .",
    "these results agree with and generalize the scaling behavior obtained previously by edelman in @xcite for @xmath58 gaussian matrices .",
    "the scaled asymptotic p.d.f .  which we derive for @xmath52",
    "is expressed in closed form for arbitrary @xmath59 , whilst for @xmath56 it involves a single finite - range integral for the general case and a closed - form solution for the scenario @xmath60 .",
    "to facilitate our main derivations , we will require the following preliminary results and definitions .",
    "let the elements of @xmath0 ( @xmath61 ) be independent and identically distributed complex standard normal variables .",
    "then the matrix @xmath62 is said to follow a complex wishart distribution , i.e. , @xmath63 .",
