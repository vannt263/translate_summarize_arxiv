    "class ii methanol masers are widespread in the regions of star formation @xcite",
    ". there are several hypotheses on the sites of the class ii methanol masers formation .",
    "first maser sources of this type were found toward ultra - compact hii regions @xcite and for some sources this association has been confirmed interferometrically ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . indeed , class ii methanol masers can be excited by emission of the youngest hii regions with high emission measure @xcite .",
    "another hypothesis about association of class ii methanol masers with accretion disks was suggested by @xcite and finds support in interferometric observations ( e.g. @xcite ) . actually , these two hypotheses are not in contradiction because photoevaporation of disks around massive stars can give birth to the youngest hii regions @xcite .",
    "in the case of disks the maser pumping is greatly influenced by the dust emission which has high potential to produce bright masers @xcite . according to the other hypothesis class ii methanol masers",
    "are formed in the outflows from the young stellar objects ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the masers in the outflows can be pumped by the heated dust .",
    "in fact it is often very difficult to discriminate between the disk and the outflow sites from the maser observations @xcite and even by combination of the maser and non - maser observations ( e.g. @xcite ) because the outflow forms at the disk surface .",
    "some of class ii methanol maser sources associated with massive star formation regions show periodic variability . there could be different mechanisms underlying variability of such kind ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "it is more likely that these mechanisms have radiative nature @xcite .",
    "one of such mechanisms is proposed by @xcite and it relates the maser variability with background variations .",
    "background variations itself are caused by the variability of colliding winds in a massive binary .",
    "other possible mechanism is related with variations of the dust infrared emission that is believed pumps class ii methanol masers @xcite .",
    "as it was shown by @xcite the brightness temperature of class ii methanol masers could be very sensitive to variations of temperature of the dust @xmath3 that is the source of pumping infrared emission .",
    "@xcite suggested that dust temperature variations could be caused by pulsations of a massive protostar growing under high accretion rates .",
    "@xcite explained @xmath3 variations by the variability of the accretion rate of the disk material onto a young binary system . @xcite",
    "also claims that maser flare properties could be explained by binarity of a star associated with variable maser sources .    at the moment",
    "there are no strong evidences that the class ii methanol masers in any variable source with confirmed periodicity reside in the circumstellar disk . however , number of indications on that increases . for example , periodic variability was recently found in cepheus a by @xcite . the class ii methanol masers in this source most probably reside in the ring that is perpendicular to the jet associated with the radio continuum source hw2 @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider possibility to explain periodic methanol maser phenomena in the model with the masers produced in accretion disk containing binary system and rotating spiral shocks in its central cavity .",
    "the structure of the circum - binary disk around low mass young binaries was studied by @xcite .",
    "we assume that the similar disk structure is possible in the case of a binary with massive components ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the considered accretion disk structure has the relatively small gap in the center that is filled by the low density very hot gas and rotating spiral shocks ( bow shocks ) formed due to supersonic motion of binary components .",
    "the rotation of the bow shock leads to periodical changes in the radiation field within parts of the disk illuminated by the shock .",
    "this in turn leads to dust temperature variations in these parts of the disk .",
    "we used the simple disk model to estimate how the brightness of class ii methanol masers in the accretion disk could be affected by the bow shock illumination .",
    "we consider the case when class ii methanol masers are formed in the accretion disk around the proto - binary star containing massive and intermediate mass stars .",
    "there is a gap in the disk center formed by rotating bow shocks .",
    "we assume that the gas in the accretion disk is in thermal and ionization equilibrium .",
    "luminosity and spectrum of the radiation in some radial direction are subject to variations due to the rotation of the bow shock .",
    "the material behind the bow shock is hot , dense and luminous in the uv and optical range , depending on the shock speed .",
    "the maximums of density and temperature of the material behind the bow shock are located in the bow shock base , i.e. the shocked region close to the surface of the massive proto - binary component .",
    "the value of gas column density , @xmath4 , computed along the line of sight between the disk center and the outer disk boundary ( excluding the stellar material ) attains its maximum when the bow shock base is on this line of sight @xcite .",
    "the luminosity of the radiation that strikes the inner accretion disk boundary is maximum when the boundary is illuminated by the material close to the bow shock base and this corresponds to the mmiss ( moment of maximum illumination by the spiral shock material ) .",
    "the rotation of the spiral shock wave material causes relevant change of @xmath3 in the disk .",
    "this change of @xmath3 affects the pumping of methanol maser and thus leads to the maser variability .    to estimate the maser brightness in the accretion disk under the miso and mmiss conditions we used two models .",
    "the first model includes the disk and the proto - binary stellar system that is in the disk central gap ( fig .",
    "[ modelscheme]a ) . in the second model",
    "we introduce a shocked gas layer that partially fills the space between the accretion disk inner boundary and the massive component ( fig .",
    "[ modelscheme]b ) .",
    "this gas layer modifies the massive star radiation before it strikes the inner disk boundary and produces great amount of radiation itself . the radiation of the intermediate mass component is not included in the second model because it is eclipsed by the massive component .",
    "these two models mimic binary and spiral shocks configurations similar to those presented in fig .",
    "[ modelschemewithshock ] .",
    "the eclipse of the massive proto - binary component by the intermediate mass component is not considered in this study .",
    "also we do not account for the bow shock borne by the intermediate mass component and for variations of dilution factors due to orbital motion of proto - binary components .      to estimate physical conditions in the circum - binary accretion disk and to compute the radiation intensity from the spiral shock material we used the photoionization code cloudy version c13.02 @xcite .",
    "to compute physical parameters of the accretion disk under the miso conditions we used following cloudy input parameters :    1 .",
    "central stars : the massive star and intermediate mass star .",
    "massive star has the mass @xmath5 , effective temperature @xmath6  k , surface gravity log@xmath7  dex , bolometric luminosity @xmath8 , solar metallicity @xcite .",
    "the atmosphere model for this star was taken from the @xcite grid of stellar atmosphere models .",
    "intermediate mass star has @xmath9 , @xmath10  k , log@xmath7  dex , @xmath11 , solar metallicity , atmosphere model from the @xcite grid .",
    "stellar luminosities and radii were obtained for the given log@xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 values .",
    "combined radiation of both stars is represented by the sum of their radiation fields from the central stellar source .",
    "2 .   geometry of the disk is flat .",
    "inner disk radius is assumed to be 1.9  au .",
    "this radius is roughly equal to the size of the central disk gap estimated for a binary with components mass ratio of 0.54 and semi - major axis of the binary equal to 1.145  au .",
    "the estimate was obtained by linear extrapolation of values calculated by @xcite in the framework of resonance theory .",
    "outer disk radius is 1000  au which is close to the value obtained by @xcite from their observations of the circumstellar disk around massive young stellar object in the carina nebula .",
    "disk semi - height is 0.38  au .",
    "this value was obtained with the ratio of the height of the disk to its inner radius equal to 0.2 , which corresponds to the estimate obtained by @xcite .",
    "chemical composition of the disk is the subjective mean of the orion nebula abundances determined by @xcite .",
    "we use the cloudy abundance set for hii regions .",
    "we assume that the dust has cloudy built - in grain properties that were obtained for the orion nebula by @xcite .",
    "grain physics described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "graphite and silicate grains distributed in 10 size bins are included in our calculations .",
    "the minimum radius of graphite and silicate grains is 0.03  @xmath15 m while the maximum radius is 0.25  @xmath15 m .",

    "the dependence of gas - to - dust ratio on the dust temperature was chosen to provide good convergence of cloudy calculations .",
    ".   additional heating due to the viscous dissipation @xmath18 is treated in the framework of @xmath19-disk model @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath19  dimensionless parameter of the @xmath19-disk model which is held constant over the disk ; @xmath21  local gas pressure ; @xmath22  gravitational constant ; @xmath14  total mass of the binary ; @xmath23  distance to the disk center .",
    "we made calculations with @xmath24 and @xmath25 which were , respectively , minimum and maximum values of @xmath19 obtained by @xcite by fitting spectral energy distributions of classical t  tauri stars .",
    "9 .   hydrogen number density ( the sum of number densities of ionized , neutral , molecular and other hydrogen varieties ) @xmath26 is proportional to inverse disk radius @xmath27 .",
    "this is consistent with the estimates of @xcite for the surface density distribution in the disks around massive stars under assumption that the surface density profile is close to the number density profile .",
    "the hydrogen number density at the inner disk edge is @xmath28  @xmath29 .",
    "such density distribution along with the chosen stellar parameters is allows to obtain high model brightness of 6.7 and 12.1  ghz class ii methanol masers ( see section  [ section : maser_calculation ] for details on maser brightness calculations ) .",
    "+ our assumption on the ionization equilibrium of the gas at the disk inner boundary is valid for the disk with the chosen parameters .",
    "this is realized due to the high hydrogen density at the inner disk edge which corresponds to the hydrogen recombination time of about tens of minutes which is small compared to the binary orbital period .",
    "stellar masses and semi - major axis of the binary were chosen to obtain supersonic velocity for the orbital motion of the massive component and the binary orbital period equal to 100 days .",
    "such period is close to observed values .",
    "cloudy input parameters to mimic physical state of the disk under the mmiss conditions are almost the same .",
    "the difference is that the disk is illuminated by combined emission of the shocked dust - free gas layer that is located in a central disk gap and the massive stellar component .",
    "this seed radiation is computed with cloudy assuming that the shocked gas layer has the constant density and temperature .",
    "the geometry of this layer is half of a flat disk with the inner radius and semi - height of 0.022  au ( radius of the massive star ) , outer radius of 0.2  au .",
    "we made calculations for two shocked gas layer densities @xmath30  @xmath29 and @xmath31  @xmath29 .",
    "along with the outer layer radius this increases @xmath4 by a factor of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively , compared to @xmath4 in the model without this layer .",
    "these column density jumps are consistent with those obtained by @xcite .",
    "the shocked gas layer temperature is 30222  k. this temperature equals the post - shock temperature @xmath34 calculated as @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36  hydrogen atom mass ; @xmath15  mean molecular weight ( for considered chemical composition it is @xmath37 assuming that the gas is ionized ) ; @xmath38  boltzmann constant ; @xmath39  shock velocity equal to 43.6  km  s@xmath40 corresponds to the linear velocity of the massive component motion on the circular orbit .",
    "it should be noted that in reality the gas temperature behind the bow shock is not constant .",
    "the dense gas behind the shock effectively and quickly cools by intense radiation .",
    "the cooling efficiency decreases as the gas density rapidly decreases behind the bow shock .",
    "the cooling rate also decreases with decreasing gas temperature .",
    "thus , the gas layer with temperature close to @xmath34 could be very narrow and located just immediately behind the moving bow shock .",
    "but the density and temperature of this layer are close to maximum and it should considerably affect the radiation that illuminates the inner disk boundary .    the approach of the hot shocked gas layer increases bolometric luminosity of the radiation which illuminates the inner boundary of the disk .",
    "the increase of the bolometric luminosity reaches @xmath41 times and @xmath42 times if the shocked gas densities are @xmath31  @xmath29 and @xmath30  @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "one can find more details of computational procedure and cloudy input scripts in the appendix .",
    "it follows from calculations of @xcite that the high brightness of class ii methanol masers could be attained only when the gas density is lower than @xmath43  @xmath29 and the pumping dust temperature exceeds 100  k. this dust temperature is close to a limit for methanol thermal desorption @xcite .",
    "the disk region with such dust temperature and gas density is located at the range of distances from 12  au to 120  au from the disk center under the miso conditions and from 12 to 400  au under the mmiss conditions .",
    "hereafter , we will call the latter disk region as the disk region with potential for maser formation .",

    "it is caused by the thermal front where the gas changes its ionization state and transits to a different branch of the cooling curve ( see cloudy documentation ) .",
    "when the the shocked gas density is equal to @xmath31  @xmath29 the thermal front is not so apparent .",
    "the temperature in this case is mostly the same as in the case of higher shocked gas density .",

    "the time of the dust temperature increase by 10  k is of the order of a few hours .",
    "the time of the gas temperature increase should be small compared to the binary orbital period as the thermal equilibrium between the dust and gas establishes quickly at high gas densities .",
    "thus , our assumption on thermal equilibrium of the disk material is valid .",
    "the dust temperature jump in the mmiss allows to preserve high methanol abundance even if the dust temperature falls below 100  k under the miso conditions .",
    "this is because the characteristic time of methanol abundance changes greatly exceeds the binary orbital period .",
    "the dust temperature is almost independent on the @xmath19 value .",
    "this means that in the case of low disk viscosity there could be a disk region where both low gas kinetic temperature and high dust temperature could be realized simultaneously .",
    "such conditions are preferable for creation of extremely bright masers because the greater the difference between gas and dust temperatures the higher the brightness of 6.7  ghz maser @xcite .",

    "using simple model we have shown that in the circum - binary accretion disk with the structure similar to the one presented by @xcite the illumination of the disk by the bow shock hot material led to the variation of the dust temperature in the disk and considerably increased probability of the maser flare in the disk .",
    "the influence of the disk illumination by bow shock material on the maser brightness in the disk depends on the density of the shocked material . in this study we considered the illumination by the material in the bow shock base originating close to the massive component surface .",
    "the appearance of the bow shock base in the line between considered position and the disk center corresponds to the maximum rise of column density @xmath4 ( given in section  [ section : general_description ] ) and leads to considerable increase of the radiation luminosity in the considered part of the disk .",

    "it is shown that the pattern of @xmath4 variation depends on inclination angle of the binary , and the maser flare pattern can change accordingly .    in our model the probability of the maser flare in the disk area close to its center depends on viscosity in the disk which is described by parameter @xmath19 . when the viscosity is relatively low ( @xmath24 ) in the narrow disk area ( 1550  au from the disk center ) the mmiss event can create a difference between the gas and dust temperatures up to @xmath72100 k. as a result , under the mmiss conditions the 6.7 and 12.1  ghz maser brightness in this disk area is much higher when the viscosity is low compared to the case when the viscosity is relatively high ( @xmath25 ) and the great temperature difference does not occur .",
    "when the disk viscosity is low the brightness of 107  ghz maser formed at impact parameters 1250  au under the mmiss conditions strongly depends on the shocked gas density .",
    "when shocked density is maximum among the considered in this study , the brightness of 107  ghz maser is lower compared to the case when the shocked gas density is lower .",
    "thus , while the spiral shock rotates and the column density increases there could be dips of the 107  ghz maser brightness under the mmiss conditions .",
    "the 9.9  ghz maser in our model attains its maximum brightness at greater distances from the disk center than other masers considered in this study .",
    "this means that the maser at 9.9  ghz can be observed at positions and velocities different from those of the 6.7 , 12.1 and 107  ghz masers formed in the same object .",
    "brightness of the 9.9  ghz maser formed at impact parameters 50200  au decreases under the mmiss conditions .",
    "the effect strongly depends on the shocked gas density and becomes less pronounced with the distance from the center , disappearing at 200  au .",
    "the period of maser flares in our model is equal to the binary orbital period .",
    "if the binary consists of two massive stars then one can expect that the period of maser flares will be a half of the orbital period .",
    "the amplitude of the periodic flares is sensitive to variations in the shocked gas density and local parameters in the disk region where the masers are formed .",
    "the 6.7  ghz and 12.1  ghz transitions show almost the same dependence of the maser brightness on the illumination ( mmiss or miso ) conditions .",
    "the 107  ghz and 9.9  ghz transitions can display flares or dips with the same period depending on the disk properties .    in this paper we considered stable axisymmetric disk model with monotonous dependence of parameters on the distance from the center .",
    "real disks are inhomogeneous .",
    "parameters of the disks around binary systems as well as those of the binary systems are subject to time variations .",
    "this can result in the changes of variability patterns of different transitions with time .",
    "episodic increases of accretion rate represent another cause of the increase of stellar luminosity and gas density in the spiral shock .",
    "this can produce an effect similar to the mmiss event . according to our calculations the variation of the luminosity by about one and",
    "a quarter order of magnitude causes considerable changes of the brightness of masers formed in the accretion disk .",
    "we did not consider changes of the accretion rate but one has to expect that similar variation of the luminosity due to episodic changes of accretion rate can lead to episodic flares / dips of masers .",

    "we have changed the standard behavior of two cloudy commands .",
    "the first command is `` hextra ss '' and it is used to include heating due to viscous dissipation .",
    "we made so that the heating rate introduced by this command is varied not only due to gas pressure variation but also with the radius from the disk center .",
