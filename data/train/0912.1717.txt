    "techniques using x - ray fluorescence are non - destructive methods to determine the elemental composition of material samples in a variety of applications , from planetary science to cultural heritage .",
    "software systems that deal with x - ray fluorescence , either for elemental analysis or monte carlo simulation , require accurate values of the physics parameters relevant for this process : the cross sections for the occurrence of the primary process creating a vacancy in the shell occupancy , the probability of radiative transitions once a vacancy has been created , and the energy of the emitted x - rays , which is determined by the binding energies of the atomic levels involved in the transition .",
    "these quantities usually derive from theoretical calculations , since experimental measurements can not practically cover the entire range of physics conditions ( target elements and incident particle characteristics ) required by general - purpose software systems .",
    "the results of theoretical calculations are often tabulated in data libraries to avoid time - consuming computations of complex analytical formulae in software applications .",
    "calculations of radiative transition probabilities according to two different approaches , based on the hartree - slater and hartree - fock methods , are documented in the literature @xcite .",
    "tabulations deriving from calculations with the hartree - slater method are collected in the evaluated atomic data library ( eadl ) @xcite , which is used by various monte carlo codes , including geant4 @xcite , for the simulation of x - ray fluorescence .",
    "gupix @xcite , a specialized software system which is widely used for elemental analysis with pixe ( particle induced x - ray emission ) techniques , instead uses a database of k and l x - ray intensities based on hartree - fock calculations ; however , this code and its databases are not freely available .",
    "a systematic and quantitative evaluation of the relative merits of the two theoretical methods with respect to an extensive data sample is not available yet .",
    "this issue has been addressed by the study documented in this paper .",
    "if one considers two energy levels in an atom , a perturbation to the system ( like excitation or ionization ) results in a superposition of the wavefunctions of the two levels ; this superposition manifests itself as a probability amplitude or a charge cloud .",
    "this charge cloud oscillates with a frequency that is equal to the energy difference between the two states , causing the emission of radiation .",
    "if this disturbed system consists of only one electron , there is only the interaction between the nucleus and the electron to consider , and this can be described by a @xmath0 potential ; for a many - electron system the repulsive force between the electron in question and the other electrons in the atom should also be included .",
    "this repulsive force is assumed to act centrally , like the @xmath0 force between the electron and the nuclues ; combining these two , one can define the central field .",
    "the structure of this field is a function of the effective charge z@xmath1 of the screened nucleus and this screening , hence z@xmath1 is a function of the effective distance @xmath2 of the electron from the nucleus .",
    "this field can be determined by what is called the `` self consistent field '' method : an initial guess about the form of this field is made , which is used in the time - dependent schrdinger equation to compute the wavefunctions ; these are then used to calculate the charge distribution , and finally the potential set up by the charge distribution is determined .",
    "if the initial guess and the computed value do not match , the process is iterated .",
    "this calculation was first made using the hartree - slater approach , where the electrons are assumed to move independently , with their mutual interaction accounted for by a mean field central potential ; electrons , moreover , are treated relativistically and the effect of retardation is included @xcite .",
    "however , within this approach initial and final wave functions are assumed to be identical , therefore missing some of the effects induced by the the fermi statistics .",
    "the restricted hartree - fock approach was an obvious correction , giving a more accurate estimate of matrix elements of the transition operator between different subshells @xcite : the improvement comes essentially because there is room for a non vanishing overlap integral between initial and final single particle wave functions , which now are not assumed to be identical .",
    "the validation study involved the comparison of fluorescence transition probabilities deriving from theoretical calculations against experimental measurements .",
    "the theoretical and experimental data relevant to this study are available under various forms in the literature :    * radiative emission rates , i.e. rates of decays of vacancies in a given shell accompanied by the emission of x - rays , * ratios of radiative emission rates , where the numerator and denominator in the ratios may concern an individual transition or a set of transitions , * probabilities of radiative transitions concerning individual shells , normalized over both radiative and non - radiative transitions .",
    "the various data references cover different sets of transitions .",
    "the different types of data were converted into a consistent representation to allow their comparison : transition probabilities over a common subset of transitions , listed in table [ tab_trans ] .",
    "the experimental data were extracted from the compilation of references in @xcite ; they were subject to selection and normalization procedures .",
    "theoretical values calculated according to the hartree - slater and hartree - fock approaches were taken from @xcite-@xcite ; the selected subset of theoretical values corresponds to the transitions for which experimental data are reported in @xcite .",
    "the radiative transition probabilities in eadl were processed similarly to the other theoretical tabulations .    for each transition , the theoretical and eadl transition probabilities as functions of the atomic number z",
    "were compared with the experimental references using statistical methods to estimate their compatibility .",
    "the @xmath3 @xcite test was performed to compare the data for each element .",
    "the null - hypothesis in the @xmath3 test assumed that the experimental data and those based on theoretical calculations derive from the same parent population ; a 0.05 significance level was set to define the critical region of rejection of the null hypothesis .",
    "contingency tables were exploited to analyze the data resulting from the outcome of the @xmath3 test for each category of theoretical data .",
    "they were built based on the number of transitions that pass or fail the @xmath3 test , i.e. for which the p - value resulting from the test is greater or smaller than 0.05 . in the analysis of the contingency tables the null hypothesis assumed the categories under evaluation to be equivalent regarding their accuracy to reproduce the experimental data .",
    "contingency tables were analyzed with fisher s exact test @xcite ; as a cross - check , a @xmath3 test was also performed on the contingency tables , applying yates correction @xcite to account for the small number of entries in the tables .",
    "an extensive compilation of experimental emission rates ratios for the k and l shell transitions is documented in @xcite .",
    "to date it is still the most complete source of k and l shell experimental transition probability ratios ; its relevance is confirmed by the fact that a recent database for x - ray spectroscopy @xcite , available from the nist ( national institute of standards ) @xcite , is based on it for what concerns k and l radiative transition probabilities .",
    "later measurements @xcite have been found consistent with the content of @xcite .",
    ".radiative transition probabilities examined in this study [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     assuming a confidence level of 95% , one can observe in table [ tab_chi2 ] that the @xmath3 test rejects the null hypothesis of equivalence of the distributions subject to the test for a larger number of cases when comparing hartree - slater calculations to experimental data , with respect to comparisons involving hartee - fock ones . for transitions directly compared to experimental data ( i.e. those listed in the left column of table [ tab_trans ] ) ,",
    "the null hypothesis is rejected in 53% of the test cases for the hartree - slater calculations , while it is rejected in 6% of the cases for the hartree - fock ones .",
    "the rejection of the null hypothesis occurs in a slightly larger number of the test cases ( 59% ) for eadl with respect to hartree - slater calculations .",
    "an analysis based on contingency tables was performed to estimate the statistical significance of the different accuracy observed with hartree - slater and eadl theoretical transition probabilities with respect to the hartree - fock ones .",
    "the contingency tables were based on the number of test cases which pass or fail the @xmath3 test , assuming a 95% confidence level for the rejection of the null hypothesis .",
    "the transitions involving direct comparisons to experimental data and the whole set of transitions were examined separately , to avoid introducing a possible bias in the conclusions due to different treatments of the data .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ tab_cont ] .",

    "the statistical results reported in the previous section are the basis for comparative evaluations .      the results of the statistical analysis in the previous section highlight a significant difference in the overall accuracy of the hartree - slater and hartree - fock calculations of radiative transition probabilities .",
    "while the more refined nature of the hartree - fock approach has been known from a theoretical perspective , this study provides a quantitative appraisal of the relative merits of the two calculations with respect to a large experimental sample .",
    "more precise experimental data over a large number of elements would be needed to achieve firm conclusions of the relative accuracy of the two methods for individual atomic transitions .",
    "some differences are observed in table [ tab_chi2 ] regarding the p - values related to the comparison of hartree - slater calculations and eadl against the experimental references .",
    "small differences in the test statistics could derive from the data treatment described in the previous sections , which involves various manipulations to normalize the data to common references ; however , large observed discrepancies should be ascribed to other reasons , which can not be elucidated based on eadl documentation @xcite .",
    "one can observe significant differences between the eadl values and the hartree - slater calculations for the l@xmath4-m@xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - l2m1 ] ) , l@xmath4-m@xmath6 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - l2m4 ] ) , l@xmath7-m@xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - l3m1 ] ) and l@xmath7-m@xmath8 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - l3m5 ] ) transitions ; some discrepancies are also visible for l@xmath7-m@xmath6 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - l3m4 ] ) and l@xmath7-n@xmath9 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - l3n45 ] ) .",
    "discrepancies against experimental data were observed for some of these transitions in @xcite .",
    "similar differences were observed @xcite between transition probabilities calculated by geant4 , which uses eadl in its atomic relaxation package @xcite , and the fitted data in @xcite .",
    "apart from these inconsistencies , the eadl content appears to reflect the hartree - slater calculations in @xcite ; therefore the comments about the overall relative accuracy of hartree - slater calculations in the previous section hold for eadl too .",
    "the results of this study suggest that a revision of eadl would be desirable to include more accurate radiative transition probabilities based on hartree - fock calculations .",
    "a systematic and quantitative validation of the existing theoretical models for computing k and",
    "l shell fluorescence transition probabilities was performed against an extensive collection of experimental data .",
    "the results , based on statistical methods , show that transition probabilities derived from hartree - fock calculations better represent the experimental measurements .",
    "the eadl data library has been found not to represent the state - of - the - art for what concerns radiative transition probabilities .",
    "based on the quantitative evidence obtained from this study , tabulations of hartree - fock values can be recommended as a replacement for the current radiative transition probabilities in eadl .",
    "such an update of eadl would contribute to improve the accuracy of the monte carlo codes which use this data library for the simulation of x - ray fluorescence .",
