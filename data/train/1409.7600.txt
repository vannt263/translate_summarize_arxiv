    "the caccioppoli inequality @xmath21 was established in @xcite for general bounded and strongly elliptic coefficients .",
    "it would of course be preferable to establish this bound with only a norm of @xmath12 , and not of  @xmath22 , on the right - hand side . in @xcite , the authors established the bound @xmath23 for solutions @xmath12 to the equation @xmath24 in @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is an arbitrary positive number and @xmath27 a constant depending on @xmath26 .",
    "either of the bounds or suffices to generalize meyers s estimate to the higher - order case , and in fact this is done in both @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the boundary caccioppoli inequality in the case of rough domains has not been established ; we mention that some pointwise estimates were established in @xcite in the case where @xmath28 is the biharmonic operator .    in section  [ sec : caccioppoli ]",
    ", we will establish the higher - order caccioppoli inequality with no terms involving derivatives of  @xmath12 on the right - hand side ; we will also establish this inequality in the dirichlet and neumann boundary cases .",

    "this solution has been used extensively in the theory of biharmonic and polyharmonic functions . the fundamental solution in the case of general constant coefficients has also been used ; see , for example , @xcite . in the case of variable analytic coefficients",
    "the fundamental solution was constructed in @xcite , and in the case of smooth coefficients the green s function in domains was constructed in @xcite .",
    "we will initially construct the fundamental solution for higher - order systems only in the case where solutions are continuous and satisfy the local bound  . again by morrey s inequality and the higher - order generalizations of the caccioppoli inequality  , this is true whenever the elliptic operator @xmath0 is of order @xmath45 .",
    "thus , we will begin by constructing the fundamental solution in the case of low dimension or high order .",
    "then , given an operator @xmath0 of order @xmath46 , we will construct an appropriate auxiliary operator @xmath47 of order @xmath48 and construct the fundamental solution @xmath49 for @xmath0 from the fundamental solution  @xmath50 for  @xmath47 .",
