    "molecular modeling and simulation is a progressive approach for describing and predicting thermophysical properties of both pure substances and mixtures of technical interest .",
    "many authors have shown the excellent capabilities of this molecular approach for different applications @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the more widespread use of molecular methods for engineering applications is still restricted by the scarcity of suitable molecular models .    for many substances ,",
    "transferable molecular models have been developed , i.e. force fields for classes of compounds like alkanes or alcohols .",
    "thereby , it is assumed that the parameters for functional groups are valid for different molecular species .",
    "the main disadvantage of transferable models is that their parameters were adjusted for the whole substance class and may not be optimal for a specific substance .",
    "furthermore , they do not cover substances outside the modeled class .",
    "an overview and assessment of some commonly used transferable potentials can be found in @xcite .",
    "molecular models that were optimized for specific substances are available only for selected compounds and , particularly older ones , sometimes do not show the desired quality .",
    "therefore , from an engineering point of view , a method for the rapid development of new molecular models for specific substances is of great interest .",
    "moreover , the molecular models should be accurate , simple , and computationally efficient . in the present paper , a systematic strategy",
    "is proposed to develop such models .",
    "the present work is restricted to rigid , non - polarizable models for comparatively small molecules .",
    "the models have state - independent parameters throughout . for computational efficiency",
    ", the united - atom approach is used , i.e. hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon are not modeled explicitly .",
    "the proposed strategy uses information determined by quantum mechanical ( qm ) _ ab initio _ calculations to include physically sound molecular properties and to reduce the number of adjustable parameters .",
    "a remaining subset of model parameters  typically two to four  is subsequently optimized by adjustment to experimental data on vapor - liquid equilibria ( vle ) of the pure substances . the aim is to achieve deviations to experimental values for the vapor pressure , saturated liquid density , and enthalpy of vaporization in the range from triple point to critical point of below 5 , 1 , and 5% , respectively .",
    "such accurate models are known to have an excellent extrapolative and predictive power .",
    "this was recently shown , e.g. , by the prediction of 17 different thermophysical properties for ethylene oxide , covering phase equilibria , thermal , caloric , transport properties , and surface tension @xcite , or for ammonia including structural quantities @xcite .",
    "molecular models that were developed on the basis of qm calculations stand between strictly _ ab initio _ models and fully empirical models .",
    "the present strategy is based on the idea to include substantial _ ab initio _ information without giving up the freedom to reasonably optimize the model to important macroscopic thermodynamic properties .",
    "thus , for the modeling process some experimental data is needed for optimization .",
    "all three chosen properties , mentioned above , have the advantage to be well available for numerous engineering fluids and to represent dominant features of the fluid state .",
    "the parameters of a molecular model can be separated into three groups .",
    "firstly , geometric parameters specify the locations of the different interaction sites of the molecular model .",
    "secondly , electrostatic parameters define the interactions of static polarities of the single molecules . and",
    "finally , dispersive and repulsive parameters determine the attraction by london forces and the repulsion by overlaps of the electronic orbitals . here , the lennard - jones 12 - 6 ( lj ) potential @xcite was used to assure straightforward compatibility with the overwhelming majority of the molecular models in the literature .    to describe the intermolecular interactions ,",
    "a varying number of lj sites and superimposed ideal point dipoles and/or ideal linear point quadrupoles were used .",
    "point dipoles or quadrupoles were employed for the description of the electrostatic interactions to reduce the computational effort significantly .",
    "a point dipole may , e.g. when a simulation program does not support this interaction site type , be approximated by two point charges @xmath0 separated by a distance @xmath1 .",
    "limited to small @xmath1 , one is free to choose this distance as long as @xmath2 holds .",
    "analogously , a point quadrupole can be approximated by three collinear point charges @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath3 separated by @xmath1 each , where @xmath5 .",
    "the total intermolecular interaction energy writes as    @xmath6 \\right . +",

    "interactions between lj sites of different type are determined by applying the standard lorentz - berthelot combining rules @xcite    @xmath24    and    @xmath25",
    "in a recent publication , sandler et al . @xcite gives a brief overview on the use of qm for the calculation of thermophysical properties . by numerically solving schrdinger s equation ,",
    "it is nowadays possible to calculate different molecular properties for technically relevant components in a quite standardized way .",
    "many different qm codes are available for this task . for license reasons , the open source code gamess(us ) @xcite",
    "was used in the present work .",
    "all geometric data of the molecular models , i.e. bond lengths , angles , and dihedrals , were directly taken from qm calculations .",
    "therefore , a geometry optimization , i.e. an energy minimization , was initially performed using gamess(us ) @xcite .",
    "the hartree - fock level of theory was applied with a relatively small ( 6 - 31 g ) basis set . alternatively ,",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) methods , e.g. bly3p , can be used , as they are known to give reasonable results for the molecular structure @xcite .",
    "the resulting configuration of the atoms was taken without subsequent modification to specify the position of the lj sites in space , except for the hydrogen atoms .",
    "as the united atom approach was used to obtain computationally efficient molecular models , the hydrogen atoms were modeled together with the carbon atom they are bonded to . for the methylene ( ch@xmath26 ) and methyl ( ch@xmath27 ) united atom sites ,",
    "the lj potential was located at the geometric mean of the nuclei , while the methine ( ch ) united atom site was located at 0.4 of the distance between carbon and hydrogen atom , cf .",
    "figure  [ fig_united_atom ] .",
    "these empirical offsets are in good agreement with the results of ungerer et al .",
    "@xcite , which were found by optimization of transferable molecular models for n - alkanes .",
    "intermolecular electrostatic interactions mainly occur due to static polarities of single molecules that can well be obtained by qm . here",
    ", the mller - plesset 2 level was used that considers electron correlation in combination with the polarizable 6 - 311g(d , p ) basis set .",
    "the purpose of the present work is the development of effective pair potentials with a state - independent set of model parameters .",
    "obviously , the electrostatic interactions are stronger in the liquid state than in the gaseous state due to the higher density .",
    "furthermore , the mutual polarization raises their magnitude in the liquid .",
    "thus , for the calculation of the electrostatic moments by qm a liquid - like state should be considered .",
    "this was done here by placing the molecule within a dielectric continuum and assigning the experimental dielectric constant of the liquid to it , as in the cosmo method @xcite .    from the resulting electron density distribution for the small symmetric molecules regarded here ,",
    "ideal point dipoles and ideal linear point quadrupoles were estimated by simple integration over the orbitals .",
    "magnitudes and orientations of these electrostatic interaction sites were used in the molecular models without any modification .    for other , more complex molecules , more sophisticated methods like chelp @xcite , chelpg @xcite , or the distributed multipole analysis @xcite are available in the literature .",
    "these methods adjust a set of partial charges or higher order electrostatic sites to the electrostatic potential around the molecule calculated by qm .",
    "although they are able to reflect the electrostatic interactions with higher accuracy , they are not considered here . they always yield a larger number of interaction sites if they are not co - located with other sites and would thus lead to computationally more expensive molecular models",
    ".      it would be highly desirable to also calculate the dispersive and repulsive interactions using _ ab initio _ methods as well .",
    "this approach was followed by different authors in the past , e.g. for neon @xcite , argon @xcite , krypton @xcite , nitrogen @xcite , carbon dioxide @xcite , hydrogen chloride @xcite , acetonitrile @xcite , methanol @xcite , acetylene @xcite , and methanethiol @xcite . however , from an engineering point of view , this leads to difficulties .    for an estimation of dispersive and repulsive interactions at least two molecules",
    "must be taken into account . to properly scan the energy hyper surface ,",
    "many qm calculations at different distances and orientations of the molecules have to be performed . as the dispersive , and partly also the repulsive ,",
    "interactions are just a very small fraction of the total energy calculated by qm , highly accurate methods like coupled cluster ( cc ) with large basis sets or even extrapolations to the basis set limit must be used for this task @xcite .    due to the fact that this is computationally too expensive for engineering purposes , we used the parameters for the dispersive and repulsive interactions for an initial model from similar sites of other molecular models .",
    "some of these parameters were subsequently fitted in the optimization process to yield the correct vle behavior of the modeled substance .",
    "the optimization was performed using a newton scheme as proposed by stoll @xcite .",
    "the applied method has many similarities with the one published by ungerer et al .",
    "@xcite and later on modified by bourasseau et al .",
    "it relies on a least - square minimization of a weighted fitness function @xmath28 that quantifies the deviations of simulation results from a given molecular model compared to experimental data .",
    "the weighted fitness function writes as    @xmath29    wherein the @xmath30-dimensional vector @xmath31 represents the set of @xmath30 model parameters @xmath32 to be optimized .",
    "the deviations of results from simulation @xmath33 to experimental data @xmath34 are weighted with the expected simulation uncertainties @xmath35 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq_fitness ] ) allows simultaneous adjustment of the model parameters to different thermophysical properties @xmath36 ( saturated liquid densities @xmath37 , vapor pressures @xmath38 , and enthalpies of vaporization @xmath39 at various temperatures in the present work ) .",
    "the unknown functional dependence of the property @xmath36 on the model parameters is approximated by a first order taylor series developed in the vicinity of the initial parameter set @xmath40    @xmath41    therein , the partial derivatives of @xmath36 with respect to each model parameter @xmath42 , i.e. the sensitivities , are calculated from difference quotients    @xmath43    assuming a sound choice of the model parameter variations @xmath44 , i.e. small enough to ensure linearity and large enough to yield differences in the simulation results significantly above the statistical uncertainties , this method allows a step - wise optimization of the molecular model by minimization of the fitness function @xmath28 .",
    "experience shows that an optimized set of model parameters was usually found within a few iterative steps when starting from a reasonable initial model .",
    "correlations for vapor pressure , saturated liquid density , and enthalpy of vaporization , taken from the dippr database @xcite , were used as `` experimental data '' for model adjustment and evaluation .",
    "this was done even in cases where the correlation is based on no or only few true experimental data points , as the correlations were regarded best practice .",
    "the comparison between simulation results and experiment was done by applying fits to the simulation data according to lotfi et al . @xcite .",
    "the relative deviation between fit and correlation was calculated in steps of 1  k from 55 to 97% of the critical temperature and is denoted by `` mean unsigned error '' in the following .",
    "vapor - liquid equilibrium simulations were performed using the grand equilibrium method by vrabec et al .",
    "@xcite , technical simulation details are given in the appendix .",
    "the selected ten molecules belong to different substance classes to show the wide applicability of the proposed strategy . in the present work , we restricted ourselves to small molecules , where the internal degrees of freedom may be neglected . thus , the molecular models are rigid , using the most stable configuration determined by qm .",
    "the optimized parameter sets of the new molecular models are summarized in table  [ tab_parameter ] .",
    "table  [ tab_critical ] compares the critical properties from simulation to experimental data .",
    "the critical properties from simulation were obtained through fits to vle simulation results as suggested by lotfi et al . @xcite .",
    "the estimated uncertainties of critical temperature , critical density , and critical pressure from simulation are 0.5 , 2 , and 2% , respectively . a very good agreement between simulation and experiment",
    "was reached , being predominantly within the combined error bars .    in the following sections , substance specific details",
    "are briefly discussed .",
    "furthermore , references to alternative models from the literature are given and the simulation results from the present models are compared to simulation data from the literature where available .",
    "numerical vle simulation results are given as supplemtary material .",
    "the branched alkane iso - butane and the cyclic alkane cyclohexane show only very weak static polarities . here , the main contributions to the intermolecular interaction are dispersion and repulsion .",
    "the electrostatic interactions have only a minor influence but should not be neglected completely .    in the literature different molecular models for iso - butane",
    "can be found , which are mostly based on force fields for branched alkanes . the well - known opls force field by jorgensen et al .",
    "is available in two versions for iso - butane , one using the united - atom approach @xcite and one using an all - atom description @xcite .",

    "the polarity was modeled by a single ( weak ) dipole ( 0.1347  d ) located in the center of mass .",
    "orientation and magnitude of the dipole were taken from the qm calculation .",
    "for the initial model , the lj parameters were taken from ungerer et al .",

    "a very good agreement was obtained for the present model yielding mean unsigned errors in vapor pressure , saturated liquid density , and enthalpy of vaporization of 4.2 , 0.6 , and 1.8% , respectively , in the temperature range from 55 to 97% of the critical temperature , which is about 225 to 395  k. for vapor pressure , the present model yields significantly better results than the trappe force field , while no simulation data is available from nath and de pablo for this property . for saturated liquid density ,",

    "all parameters of the molecular model are given in table  [ tab_parameter ] .",
    "simulation results for acetonitrile are compared to experimental vle data in figures  [ fig_vle3_rho ] to [ fig_vle3_dhv ] .",
    "the relative deviations between simulation and experiment are shown in figure  [ fig_vle_acetonitril_dev ] next to results of the opls - ua force field by jorgensen and briggs @xcite and the trappe force field by wick et al . , which were reported for both models in @xcite . despite the good experimental data base ,",
    "the desired quality was not achieved by the present optimization .",
    "only a fair description of the experimental vle was reached .",
    "mean unsigned errors in vapor pressure , saturated liquid density , and enthalpy of vaporization are 19.7 , 0.9 , and 5.4% , respectively .",
    "the large relative deviations in vapor pressure result from systematic underestimations at low temperatures . in this region also difficulties were encountered in the simulative calculation of the chemical potential in the liquid phase to determine the phase equilibrium .",
    "this was even the case when the more sophisticated gradual insertion method @xcite was used , as described in the appendix in greater detail .",
    "the opls - ua force field by jorgensen and briggs @xcite significantly overestimates the vapor pressure of acetonitrile and shows deviations in the saturated liquid density up to 4% , cf .",
    "figure  [ fig_vle_acetonitril_dev ] .",
    "simulation results for vapor pressure obtained with the trappe force field by wick et al .",
    "@xcite show a very good agreement with the dippr correlation , while the saturated density is slightly overpredicted towards the critical point .",
    "no comparison of the literature models for acetonitrile is possible regarding the enthalpy of vaporization due to the lack of numerical simulation results .    the present molecular model for nitromethane consists of four lj sites , one for the methyl group , one for the nitrogen atom , and one for the two oxygen atoms each .",
    "the electrostatic interactions were modeled by one dipole and one quadrupole oriented along the symmetry axis , where the parameters were specified according to qm results .",
    "all six lj parameters were adjusted to experimental vle data .",
    "alternative models are available in the literature @xcite .",
    "figures  [ fig_vle2_rho ] to [ fig_vle2_dhv ] compare the present simulation results for nitromethane with experimental vle data .",
    "figure  [ fig_vle_nitromethan_dev ] shows the relative deviations obtained with the present model , the opls - aa force field by price et al .",
    "@xcite , and the trappe force field by wick et al .",
    "for the present model of nitromethane , mean unsigned errors in vapor pressure , saturated liquid density , and enthalpy of vaporization are 18.7 , 0.2 , and 7.0% , respectively .",
    "again , a systematic underprediction of the vapor pressure at low temperatures was found , leading to the high relative deviations , as for acetonitrile .",
    "the opls - aa force field overpredicts the vapor pressure by about 80% and underpredicts the saturated liquid density by up to 6% .",
    "the trappe force field of wick et al .",
    "that was optimized to experimental vle data , yields very good results in vapor pressure for low temperatures while the result for the highest simulated temperature deviates by + 34% from the dippr correlation .",
    "regarding saturated liquid density , strong scatter and large statistical uncertainties of the simulation results are observed for both literature models .",
    "a strategy was proposed for the rapid development of molecular models for engineering applications .",
    "the strategy relies on results from qm _ ab initio _ calculations to include physically sound molecular properties and to reduce the number of adjustable parameters .",
    "dispersive and repulsive interactions were modeled by lj sites .",
    "thus , the lj interaction sites were located according to atom positions obtained by qm energy minimization on hartree - fock level . for the parameterization of the electrostatic interactions ,",
    "qm calculations were performed using the mller - plesset  2 level of theory and the cosmo method .",
    "the resulting electron density distribution was reduced to ideal point dipoles and ideal linear point quadrupoles located in the center of mass .",
    "the moments and orientations of the dipoles and quadrupoles were passed on to the molecular models without any modification .",
    "a united - atom approach was used for methine , methylene , and methyl groups to reduce the total number of interaction sites .",
    "the parameters of the lj sites were initially taken from similar sites of other molecular models and were subsequently optimized to reproduce experimental vle data , i.e. vapor pressure , saturated liquid density , and enthalpy of vaporization .",
    "it was aimed to achieve deviations between simulation and experiment of below 5 , 1 , and 5% in vapor pressure , saturated liquid density , and enthalpy of vaporization , respectively .",
    "the new modeling strategy was successfully applied to ten molecules from different substances classes , i.e. iso - butane , cyclohexane , formaldehyde , dimethyl ether , sulfur dioxide , dimethyl sulfide , thiophene , hydrogen cyanide , acetonitrile , and nitromethane .",
    "simulation results for the different substances agree well with correlations of experimental data taken from the dippr database @xcite , with noticeable deviations in the vapor pressure at low temperatures for acetonitrile and nitromethane .",
    "for the two elongated molecules acetonitrile and nitromethane , the reduction of the electrostatic interactions to sites located in the center of mass seems to be an over - simplification , as the optimization of the molecular models was not fully successful .",
    "also an adjustment of the electrostatic parameters , while keeping the ratio of the polar moments constant ( not reported here in detail ) , did not yield significant improvements in the quality of the molecular models .",
    "a further study , e.g. using two or more spatially distributed electrostatic sites , is beyond the scope of this paper .    for all other molecules",
    "a significant improvement compared to available molecular models from the literature was achieved . through an optimization to substance specific experimental vle data , a very good description of the phase equilibria was obtained .",
    "furthermore , in case of dimethyl ether it was shown that with the proposed modeling strategy it was possible to reach the same model quality by optimization of just two model parameters compared to five optimized parameters for the model by ketko and potoff @xcite .",

    "<S> a parameterization strategy for molecular models on the basis of force fields is proposed , which allows a rapid development of models for small molecules by using results from quantum mechanical ( qm ) _ ab initio _ calculations and thermodynamic data . </S>",
    "<S> the geometry of the molecular models is specified according to the atom positions determined by qm energy minimization . </S>",
    "<S> the electrostatic interactions are modeled by reducing the electron density distribution to point dipoles and point quadrupoles located in the center of mass of the molecules . </S>",
    "<S> dispersive and repulsive interactions are described by lennard - jones sites , for which the parameters are iteratively optimized to experimental vapor - liquid equilibrium ( vle ) data , i.e. vapor pressure , saturated liquid density , and enthalpy of vaporization of the considered substance . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed modeling strategy was applied to a sample set of ten molecules from different substance classes . </S>",
    "<S> new molecular models are presented for iso - butane , cyclohexane , formaldehyde , dimethyl ether , sulfur dioxide , dimethyl sulfide , thiophene , hydrogen cyanide , acetonitrile , and nitromethane . </S>",
    "<S> most of the models are able to describe the experimental vle data with deviations of a few percent .    </S>",
