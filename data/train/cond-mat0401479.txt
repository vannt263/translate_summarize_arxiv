    "reaction - diffusion systems , is a well - studied area .",
    "people have studied reaction - diffusion systems , using analytical techniques , approximation methods , and simulation .",
    "the approximation methods may be different in different dimensions , as for example the mean field techniques , good for high dimensions , generally do not give correct results for low - dimensional systems .",
    "a large fraction of analytical studies , belong to low - dimensional ( specially one - dimensional ) systems , as solving low - dimensional systems should in principle be easier .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one of the reasons people want to find and solve exactly - solvable systems , is that one can use perturbative methods to investigate other systems , which are not exactly solvable but _ near _ some exactly - solvable systems .",
    "the term exactly - solvable have been used with different meanings .",
    "for example , in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , solvability ( or integrability ) means that the @xmath0-particle conditional probabilities s - matrix is factorized into a product of 2-particle s - matrices ; while in @xcite , solvability means closedness of the evolution equation of the empty intervals ( or their generalization ) .    in @xcite , a ten - parameter family of reaction - diffusion processes",
    "was introduced for the systems among which , the evolution equation of @xmath1-point functions contains only @xmath1- or less- point functions .",
    "we call such systems autonomous . there , for these models the average particle - number in each site was obtained exactly . in @xcite ,",
    "this has been generalized to multi - species systems and more - than - two - site interactions .    among the important aspects of reaction - diffusion systems ,",
    "is the phase structure of the system . the static phase structure concerns with the time - independent profiles of the system , while the dynamical phase structure concerns with the evolution of the system , specially its relaxation behavior . in @xcite ,",
    "the phase structures of some classes of single- or multiple - species autonomous reaction - diffusion systems have been investigated .",
    "these investigations were based on the one - point functions of the systems .    in @xcite , the two - point functions of autonomous single - species translationally - invariant one - dimensional reaction - diffusion systems were studied .",
    "the two - point function for such systems was obtained , and it was shown that it exhibits a non - trivial dynamical phase structure .",
    "the dynamical phase structure of the system was also investigated .    in this article",
    ", we want to use perturbation to study systems which are not exactly autonomous , but _",
    "nearly _ autonomous . by this , it is meant that the rates of these systems are equal to those of an autonomous system , plus a small perturbation .",
    "the scheme of the paper is the following . in section 2 ,",
    "autonomous systems are briefly introduced . in section 3 ,",
    "non - autonomous perturbations around autonomous systems are considered , and their effect on the evolution of one - point functions is investigated . from this investigation ,",
    "it turns out that some of the autonomous systems are unstable with respect to perturbations , in the sense that any small perturbation drastically modifies the large - time relaxation of the one - point functions .",
    "section 4 is devoted to a concrete example .",
    "to fix notation , let s briefly introduce the autonomous systems . consider a one - dimensional periodic lattice , every point of which either is empty or contains one particle .",
    "let the lattice have @xmath2 sites .",
    "the observables of such a system are the operators @xmath3 , where @xmath4 with @xmath5 denotes the site number , and @xmath6 denotes the hole or the particle : @xmath7 is the hole ( vacancy ) number operator at site @xmath4 , and @xmath8 is the particle number operator at site @xmath4 .",
    "one has obviously the constraint @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a covector the components of which ( @xmath11 s ) are all equal to one .",
    "the constraint , simply says that every site is either occupied by one particle or empty .",
    "a representation for these observables is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a diagonal @xmath14 matrix the only nonzero element of which is the @xmath15th diagonal element , and the operators 1 in the above expression are also @xmath14 matrices .",
    "it is seen that the constraint can be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a vector the components of which are @xmath13 s .",
    "the state of the system is characterized by a vector @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a @xmath20-dimensional vector space .",
    "all the elements of the vector @xmath21 are nonnegative , and @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the tensor - product of @xmath2 covectors @xmath10 .",
    "as the eigenvalues of the number operators @xmath24 are zero or one ( and hence these operators are idempotent ) , the most general observable of such a system is the product of some of these number operators , or a sum of such terms .",
    "also , the constraint shows that the two components of @xmath25 are not independent .",
    "so , one can express any function of @xmath26 in terms of @xmath27 where @xmath28 is an arbitrary covector not parallel to @xmath10 .",
    "our aim is to study the evolution of the one - point functions ( @xmath29 s ) .",
    "the evolution of the state of the system is given by @xmath30 where the hamiltonian @xmath31 is stochastic , by which it is meant that its nondiagonal elements are nonnegative and @xmath32 the interaction is nearest - neighbor , iff the hamiltonian is of the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 ( it has been assumed that the sites of the system are identical , that is , the system is translation - invariant .",
    "otherwise @xmath35 in the right - hand side of would depend on @xmath4 . )",
    "the two - site hamiltonian @xmath35 is stochastic , that is , its non - diagonal elements are nonnegative , and the sum of the elements of each of its columns vanishes : @xmath36    using @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are arbitrary covectors , one can write down the evolution equations of the one- , two- , or more- point functions of @xmath40 s .",
    "the evolution equation for the one - point function is @xmath41 it is seen that the right - hand side of the above equation , contains two - point functions .",
    "in fact , in the evolution equation of @xmath1-point functions , there are generally up to @xmath42-point functions .",
    "however , there are systems for them in the evolution equation of @xmath1-point functions , only up to @xmath1-point functions arise .",
    "these are the autonomous systems . for a system with the hamiltonian @xmath43 to be autonomous ,",
    "following constraints hold among the reaction rates nd their reaction rates  @xcite .",
    "@xmath44 where @xmath45 it is not difficult to see that the constraints are equivalent to @xmath46 where @xmath47 and it is obvious that @xmath48    now , consider an autonomous system satisfying the constraints ( or equivalently ) , and take the vector @xmath49 satisfying @xmath50 and the covector @xmath28 such that @xmath51 that is , the basis @xmath52 is dual to @xmath53 . in @xcite , it is shown that the matrix in the left - hand side of the first equation in , has a left eigenvector with the eigenvalue zero .",
    "( this left eigenvector is @xmath10 . )",
    "so it does have a right eigenvector with the eigenvalue zero as well . that is ,",
    "there does exist a vector @xmath54 satisfying .",
    "in fact , one can even find a real vector @xmath54 satisfying .",
    "from now on , @xmath28 in is assumed to satisfy .",
    "consider a system with the hamiltonian @xmath35 as @xmath55 where @xmath43 is the hamiltonian of an autonomous system , and the rates corresponding to @xmath56 are small compared to those corresponding to @xmath43 .",
    "our task is to investigate the evolution one - point functions corresponding to @xmath35 , using perturbation . as @xmath35 is not necessarily autonomous",
    ", the evolution equation of the one - point function may contain two - point functions as well .",
    "however , the terms containing the two - point functions are proportional to the rates corresponding to @xmath56 , and hence are small .",
    "so , one can calculate the two - point function corresponding to the unperturbed system , and use it in the evolution equation of the one - point function of the perturbed system , to obtain up - to - first - order evolution of the one - point function of the perturbed system .",
    "assuming that the initial condition is translationally - invariant , it is seen that the one - point function is independent of the site , and the two - point function depends on only the difference of the sites numbers .",
    "so , the evolution equation for the one - point function of the unperturbed system is @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 the one - point function @xmath60 , is easily seen to be    @xmath61.\\ ] ]    also , taking @xmath62 ( the two - point function of the unperturbed system ) one arrives at @xmath63 where @xmath64 it is seen that only five parameters enter the evolution equation of the up - to - two - point functions , and all of these can be expressed in terms of the matrix elements of @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the permutation matrix .",
    "these parameters can be rewritten as @xmath67    taking a solution like @xmath68 it was shown in @xcite that , the values of @xmath69 ( energy - values ) entering the two - point function are @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and any number in the interval @xmath72 $ ] , and possibly @xmath73 @xmath74 is among the possible values of @xmath69 , iff latexmath:[\\[\\label{33 }    @xmath74 , and @xmath76 , determines the relaxation behavior of the two - point function ( its dynamical phase ) .",
    "depending on the reaction rates several phases may occur @xcite :    * @xmath77 , and @xmath74 is not an energy .",
    "this is the slower phase , and the longest relaxation time is @xmath78^{-1}$ ] .",
    "* @xmath77 , and @xmath74 is an energy , in fact the largest one .",
    "this is the slowest phase , and the longest relaxation time is @xmath79\\}^{-1}$ ] . *",
    "@xmath80 , and @xmath74 is not an energy .",
    "this is the fastest phase , and the longest relaxation time is @xmath81^{-1}$ ] . *",
    "@xmath80 , @xmath74 is an energy , and @xmath82 .",
    "this is the fast phase , and the longest relaxation time is @xmath81^{-1}$ ] .",
    "* @xmath80 , @xmath74 is an energy , and @xmath83 .",
    "this is the slow phase , and the longest relaxation time is @xmath79\\}^{-1}$ ] .",
    "now consider the hamiltonian @xmath35 , defined through , which is not necessarily autonomous .",
    "then defining @xmath84 like but with @xmath35 instead of @xmath43 , it is seen that the evolution equation of the one - point function is @xmath85 however , one can not necessarily decompose @xmath84 like . assuming translational invariance of the initial conditions , one arrives at @xmath86 where @xmath87 as @xmath88 is a basis ,",
    "one can write @xmath89 in terms of the tensor products of @xmath90 and @xmath91 . the corresponding coefficients can be found by multiplying the tensor products of @xmath92 and @xmath93 by @xmath89 .",
    "the result is @xmath94 so , @xmath95.\\ ] ] defining @xmath96 recasts to @xmath97\\nonumber\\\\ = & ( \\mu^0+\\nu^0)f+(\\sideset{^1}{{}_{\\gamma\\delta}}{\\operatorname{\\mathnormal{b}}}+ \\sideset{^2}{{}_{\\gamma\\delta}}{\\operatorname{\\mathnormal{b } } } ) \\left[f_1 u^\\gamma u^\\delta+f ( u^\\gamma v^\\delta + v^\\gamma u^\\delta ) + v^\\gamma v^\\delta\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 as expected , the coefficients of @xmath89 in the right - hand side are small ( first order in terms of the perturbation @xmath56 ) .",
    "so , one can use the zeroth - order value of @xmath89 in the right - hand side , to obtain the first - order value of @xmath99 .    from and , it is seen that if @xmath100 , then one can write @xmath101 where @xmath102 satisfies @xmath103 and its modulus is less than 1 , and @xmath104 is like , but without a term corresponding to the energy - value @xmath105 .",
    "so , one can write like @xmath106 this means that the energy - values entering @xmath99 , are those entering @xmath104 , and @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 this shows that if @xmath110 is the largest nonzero energy - value entering @xmath111 , then @xmath112 is the largest nonzero energy - value entering @xmath99 .",
    "otherwise , the largest nonzero energy - value entering @xmath99 is the largest nonzero energy - value entering @xmath111 .",
    "so the relaxation behavior of @xmath99 , can be deduced from that of @xmath111 as follows :    * in this phase the largest nonzero energy - value of @xmath99 is @xmath113 , and the perturbation causes a discontinuous change of the largest nonzero energy - value , from @xmath105 to @xmath113 . * in this phase the largest nonzero energy - value of @xmath99 is @xmath74 , and the perturbation causes a discontinuous change of the largest nonzero energy - value , from @xmath105 to @xmath74 . * in this phase the largest nonzero energy - value of @xmath99 is @xmath112 , and the perturbation causes a continuous change of the largest nonzero energy - value , from @xmath110 to @xmath112 .",
    "it is seen that the perturbation causes two different changes in the relaxation behavior of @xmath99 ( the one - point function ) . in the regions * i * , * ii * , and * v * , the perturbation causes a discontinuous change in the relaxation behavior , which means that the autonomous system is unstable with respect to perturbations . in the regions * iii * and * iv * , however , the relaxation behavior of @xmath99 is continuous with respect to the perturbations , which means that the autonomous system is stable with respect to the perturbations , at least as long as first - order perturbations of the one - point function are considered .",
    "mentioning one other thing is also in order : @xmath111 enters the evolution equation of @xmath99 , iff @xmath114 .",
    "if @xmath115 , then @xmath99 would contain only one ( nonzero ) energy - value , which is the one expected from changing one autonomous system to another .",
    "( only @xmath116 is replaced by @xmath117 and @xmath118 is replaced by @xmath119 . )    a real autonomous system , would in fact be only approximately autonomous .",
    "this means that there are always perturbations around the autonomous system .",
    "the above argument shows that only autonomous systems in the regions * iii * and * iv * can be effectively autonomous .",
    "the parameter space corresponding to the effectively - autonomous systems is @xmath120[1-(-\\mu^0/\\nu^0)]}}{2}.\\ ] ] figure 1 shows the regions corresponding to the autonomous system .",
    "( this is identical to figure 1 in @xcite . )",
    "consider an hamiltonian @xmath43 corresponding to an autonomous system : @xmath121 the reactions of the corresponding system are @xmath122$},\\nonumber\\\\ \\emptyset\\emptyset&\\to a\\emptyset,\\qquad\\hbox{with the rate $ r+[(1-\\omega)/4]$},\\nonumber\\\\ \\emptyset\\emptyset&\\to aa,\\qquad\\hbox{with the rate $ ( 1-\\omega)/4$},\\nonumber\\\\ aa&\\to\\emptyset a,\\qquad\\hbox{with the rate $ ( 1-\\omega)/4$},\\nonumber\\\\ aa&\\to a\\emptyset,\\qquad\\hbox{with the rate $ ( 1-\\omega)/4$},\\nonumber\\\\ aa&\\to\\emptyset\\emptyset,\\qquad\\hbox{with the rate $ r+[(1-\\omega)/4]$}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for this hamiltonian , one has @xmath123 and @xmath124 for the perturbation , consider the hamiltonian @xmath125 it is easy to see that this hamiltonian does not correspond to an autonomous system .",
    "this hamiltonian only increases the rate of the reaction @xmath126 by @xmath127 . using this hamiltonian",
    ", it is seen that @xmath128 from , it is seen that @xmath129 comparing this with , it is seen that the system is effectively autonomous , iff @xmath130    as a special case of the above example , let us put @xmath131 . in this case , for the nonperturbed system we have the following reactions .",
    "@xmath132 in this case , the system is effectively autonomous iff @xmath133 it is seen that changing the value of @xmath134 from @xmath70 to @xmath135 , the system starts from phase * iii * , passes through the phases * iv * , * v * , and * ii * , and finally reaches the phase * i*. at @xmath136 , the system goes from the phase * iv * to the phase * v * , which means that the system is no longer effectively autonomous .",
