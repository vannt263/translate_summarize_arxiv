    "high @xmath2 superconductivity in intermetallic layered structures attracted much attention since the discovery of superconductivity in magnesium diboride ( mgb@xmath0 ) in 2001 @xcite .",
    "however , mgb@xmath0 keeps being the intermetallic material with the highest superconducting temperature ( @xmath7 k ) and even is well known that this property is based on the strong coupling of its covalent b sigma bands with b bond - stretching modes @xcite , it has not been possible to predict a new diboride type to enhance it . on the other hand , it is widely accepted that the superconductivity on intercalated systems as cac@xmath8 is dominated by the interaction of free - electron - like interlayer states with soft intercalant modes . lately , in this context , new proposals for the quest of layered intercalated superconductors are being merged .",
    "the most recent theoretical study reports that , by decorating graphene with li atoms , a superconductor at a much higher temperature with respect to ca - covered graphene is obtained @xcite .",
    "the li - be layered compounds with a low - dimensional electronic structure and strong electron - phonon ( e - ph ) coupling , are another family of li - based compounds with possible superconducting properties under high pressure @xcite .",
    "more recently , there has been considerable interest in the structural stability , electronic band structure and chemical bond of li - b compounds under high pressures @xcite .",
    "layered li - based materials with a quasi - two - dimensional electronic structure and high dynamical energy scales resulting from the li - atom motion are potential candidates for high @xmath2 superconductors . in that direction ,",
    "first - principles calculations using data - mining approach have predicted new hypothetical intermetallic materials @xcite called metal - sandwich ( ms ) structures ms1(mb ) and ms2(m@xmath0b@xmath0 ) , which also have @xmath9-layers of boron as in mgb@xmath0 but separated by two metal layers _",
    "particularly , lib and li@xmath0b@xmath0 resulted marginally stable under ambient conditions and they become favored over the known stoichiometric compounds under pressure @xcite . both compounds resulted remarkly interesting since the @xmath4- and @xmath10-bands derived from its boron @xmath11- and @xmath12-orbitals were similars to those in mgb@xmath0 @xcite and therefore a similar superconductor mechanism based on the electron - phonon coupling between the @xmath4- and @xmath10-bands and the @xmath5 phonon mode in the boron planes was expected .",
    "recent calculations revealed that the electron - phonon coupling ( @xmath6 ) in li@xmath0b@xmath0 was weaker than in mgb@xmath0 , estimated about @xmath13 @xcite in comparison to those reported for magnesium diboride ranging from @xmath14 to @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "thus , the transition temperature of li@xmath0b@xmath0 was reported to be around 7 k @xcite .",
    "now it is also widely accepted that in mgb@xmath0 the electron - phonon coupling take a large contribution from @xmath4-bands but also a small participation from @xmath10-bands@xcite .",
    "therefore the seemingly unimportant @xmath10-electrons at @xmath16 could be determinant to increase the transition temperature of li@xmath0b@xmath0 .",
    "thus , an appropiate doping of li@xmath0b@xmath0 , in which @xmath10-electrons are increased , could result in a higher @xmath2 than in mgb@xmath0 .",
    "this hypothesis was tested by calandra _",
    "_ @xcite substituting li atoms with mg or al .",
    "nevertheless , the tests showed that it was difficult to induce a significant amount of @xmath10-states at @xmath16 with small doping because the band crossing in li@xmath0b@xmath0 happens to be exactly at @xmath16 , around @xmath17 ev lower than in mgb@xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , even from a thermodynamical stand point , doping li2b2 might be as difficult as it is for mgb@xmath19 .    from the mcmillan equation @xcite ( eq .",
    "[ eq : lambda ] ) , li@xmath0b@xmath0 would be optimistic compared to mgb@xmath0 , because li@xmath0b@xmath0 ( 0.48 states / ev ) has a higher density of states of b atoms than mgb@xmath0(0.39 states / ev ) at @xmath16 and this could enhance the electron - phonon coupling constant . however , this is not enough for arising t@xmath20 .",
    "one interesting case is represented by cabesi @xcite , a material with @xmath4- and @xmath10-bands at the fermi level and density of states twice higher than in mgb@xmath0 , but with a very low critical temperature t@xmath20= @xmath21 k. thus , while the band structure can present strong similarities with both @xmath4- and @xmath10-bands crossing the fermi level , the phonon structure and the e - ph interaction could differ substantially .    in this paper , we have analyzed why the t@xmath20 of li@xmath0b@xmath0(7 k ) has been reported lower than for mgb@xmath0(39 k ) and if it was possible to enhance the e - ph coupling of li@xmath0b@xmath0 and consequently , the superconducting temperature by applying hydrostatic pressure . since the in - plane motion of the boron atoms changes the boron orbitals overlap , an important electron - phonon coupling could be expected mainly for the @xmath4- bands at @xmath16 and the @xmath5 phonon mode . after a careful analysis of the pressure effects on the band structure and the @xmath5 phonon frequency",
    ", we found that the electron - phonon coupling and t@xmath20 decrease with pressure as a result of the strong reduction of the boron-@xmath11 states contribution to the density of states at fermi level and the hardening of the @xmath5 phonon frequency as pressure was applied .",
    "we studied the li@xmath0b@xmath0 compound ( crystal structure : ms2 ) as model of layered lithium borides .",
    "li@xmath0b@xmath0 has eight atoms in the primitive unit cell and a space group p6@xmath22/mmc ( no.194 ) .",
    "wickoff positions : li1(4f ) ( @xmath23 ) , b1(2b ) ( @xmath24 ) and b2(2d ) ( @xmath25 ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the structural parameters were fully relaxed through a molecular dynamics scheme : @xmath26=@xmath27=@xmath28  , @xmath29=@xmath30  ; @xmath31=@xmath32=@xmath33 , @xmath34=@xmath35 .",
    "the total energy calculations were performed with siesta ( spanish initiative for electronic simulations with thousands of atoms ) code @xcite based on density functional theory with exchange - correlation functionals as parametrized by perdew , burke , and ernzerhof @xcite for the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite .",
    "this code is implemented with pseudopotentials to describe electron - ion interactions and numerical atomic orbitals to expand the valence wavefunctions .",
    "pseudopotentials were generated according to the troullier - martins procedure @xcite using the atomic configurations 1@xmath362@xmath37 for li and 1@xmath362@xmath362@xmath38 for b with a core radii of 2.49 and 1.24 atomic units ( a.u . ) for li and b , respectively . as the basis set for the valence wavefunctions we have employed a double-@xmath39 basis .",
    "to calculate the integrals of the khon - sham hamiltonian , we have used a * k*-space sampling via the monkhorst - pack matrix ( @xmath40 ) with a meshcutoff of @xmath41 ry @xcite .",
    "all calculations were numerically converged when interatomic forces were less than @xmath42 mev /  .",
    "li@xmath0b@xmath0 phase was calculated as a function of cell volume @xmath43 and @xmath44 ratio .",
    "we performed total energy calculations for fifteen volumes and seven @xmath44 ratios in order to optimize both .",
    "subsequently , the total energy was fitted to the murnaghan equation of state @xcite to obtain the equilibrium volume @xmath45 and the @xmath46 equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "thus , from the @xmath46 eos the unit cell volume and @xmath44 ratio were estimated from @xmath47-@xmath48 gpa .",
    "the @xmath5-phonon mode was calculated using the frozen - phonon model @xcite that , even is a very simple model , it is still a suitable and useful approach @xcite .",
    "this approach is a direct method in which the distorted li@xmath0b@xmath0 is treated as a crystal of a lower symmetry than the non - distorted li@xmath0b@xmath0 .",
    "thus , total energy calculations of distorted crystals were performed to simulate the dynamics of the @xmath5 phonon mode .",
    "the oscillating pattern of the @xmath5 mode corresponds to boron ions in opposite directions along @xmath49- or @xmath50-axis , with li ions stationary ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) . for this , we have simulated the @xmath5-phonon mode as a composition of two modes : @xmath5(a ) and @xmath5(b ) .",
    "figure 2 represents the vibration pattern of these modes . to implement the displacement pattern of these modes , we defined an adimensional distortion parameter @xmath51 related to the boron bond , where @xmath52 is the magnitude of the distortion and @xmath26 the in - plane lattice parameter , using the unit cell volume and @xmath44 ratio for @xmath47 , @xmath53 and @xmath48 gpa previously optimized .",
    "these distortions simulated expansions and contractions of @xmath5 phonon mode as a function of the @xmath52 parameter .",
    "thus , to calculate the effective potential due to boron atoms oscillation we use a maximum adimensional displacement of @xmath54=@xmath55 and steps of @xmath56=@xmath57 .",
    "eight different displacements were calculated to simulate the vibrational dynamics of the @xmath58 and @xmath59 component modes and the total energy values of these configurations were substracted to the total energy of non - distorted li@xmath0b@xmath0 when its boron atoms are on its equilibrium positions .",
    "the energy differences determined the restitutive potential of each oscillator and they were used to solve numerically the schr@xmath60dinger equation and obtain the characteristic frequency of each mode .",
    "the superconducting critical temperature of li@xmath0b@xmath0 under pressure was evaluated using the mcmillan s relation @xcite , @xmath61,\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the coupling constant between @xmath4-band and the @xmath5 mode , @xmath63 is the average frequency of the @xmath58 and @xmath59 component modes and @xmath64 is an adimensional empirical value which represents the repulsive force between cooper pairs . to determine the coupling constant ( @xmath62 ) quantitatively , we evaluated the deformation potential @xmath65 for @xmath5(a ) and @xmath5(b ) modes under each distortion and used the isotropic limit from the eliashberg theory @xcite with the mcmillan s formula @xcite , @xmath66d^2,\\ ] ] where , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the average of the phonon frequency of the @xmath5(a ) and @xmath5(b ) modes , the deformation potential of the @xmath4-band due to @xmath5 mode , the density of states of boron atoms at fermi level and total mass of boron atoms inside unit cell , respectively .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : fig3 ] , we show the results for the @xmath26 and @xmath29 lattice parameters , and the @xmath71 ratio for li@xmath0b@xmath0 as a function of pressure for @xmath72 gpa .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath26 parameter decreases from 3.087 to 3.071  while @xmath29 parameter from 11.187 to 8.0  in the range of 20 gpa .",
    "although both , @xmath26 and @xmath29 parameters decreases , it is important to note that the slope for @xmath29 parameter as a function of pressure is higher than for @xmath26 parameter , that is , it would be easier to compress li@xmath0b@xmath0 through @xmath73-direction than in plane direction .",
    "conversely , @xmath71 decreases non - linearly and li@xmath0b@xmath0 could be compressed about @xmath74 when it is applied over 20 gpa .    the band structure of mgb@xmath0 and li@xmath0b@xmath0",
    "are shown in fig .",

    "li@xmath0b@xmath0 presents the @xmath10- and @xmath4-bands which are coupled with @xmath5 phonon mode to induce superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 .",
    "however , in li@xmath0b@xmath0 the sigma band is shifted up by 0.23 ev and the pi - band is shifted down by 1.31 ev , with respect to mgb@xmath0 .",
    "this shifting produces that the @xmath10-@xmath75 crossing occurs practically at fermi level , resulting in a small density of states from @xmath10-band at @xmath16 .",

    "<S> we present the structural , electronic and superconducting properties of li@xmath0b@xmath0 under pressure within the framework of the density functional theory . </S>",
    "<S> the structural parameters , electronic band structure , phonon frequency of the @xmath1 phonon mode and superconducting critical temperature @xmath2 were calculated for pressures up to 20 gpa . </S>",
    "<S> we predicted that the superconducting critical temperature of li@xmath0b@xmath0 is about 11 @xmath3 and this decreases as pressure increases . </S>",
    "<S> we found that even though the lattice dynamics of the @xmath1 phonon mode is similar to mgb@xmath0 , the reduction of the @xmath4-band density of states at fermi level and the raising of the @xmath5 phonon frequency with pressure were determinant to decrease @xmath6 and consequently @xmath2 . </S>"
