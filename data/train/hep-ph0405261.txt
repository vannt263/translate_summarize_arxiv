    "the exploration of neutrino masses and mixing has made tremendous progress in recent years  for a review see , e.g. , ref .  @xcite .",
    "it has turned out that lepton mixing is very different from quark mixing , with two angles of the @xmath11 mixing matrix @xmath12 being large .",
    "these angles are the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle @xmath13 with @xmath14 ( 90% cl ) or @xmath15 , and the solar mixing angle @xmath16 , which is large but significantly smaller ( at the @xmath17 level ) than @xmath18 . on the other hand ,",
    "the third angle @xmath5 is small , with @xmath19 ( @xmath20 level ) . though the data do not show _ compelling _ evidence for maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing , they nevertheless warrant the search for models where @xmath21 is enforced by symmetries and the features of small @xmath5 and large but non - maximal solar mixing come out in a natural way . for a general assessment of neutrino physics with respect to experiment and theory see ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this report",
    "we discuss models which are `` simple '' extensions of the standard model ( sm ) in the sense that the gauge group remains the same , but some multiplets of the sm gauge group are added and the seesaw mechanism @xcite is incorporated .",
    "we consider only the lepton sector , though there might be interesting relations between mixing in the lepton and quark sectors @xcite .",
    "enforcement of exact ( or near exact ) maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing suggests to make use of a non - abelian family symmetry group @xmath22 @xcite . in this report",
    "we discuss two models , one based on @xmath23 , which we call @xmath24 model @xcite for reasons to become clear in section [ z2model ] , and another one based on @xmath1 @xcite , which is discussed in section [ d4model ] . for a review on those models",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite . in section [ leptogenesis ] ,",
    "we focus on leptogenesis in these models .",
    "other non - abelian family symmetries which have been considered are @xmath25 @xcite and @xmath26 @xcite . for a general review on models for neutrino masses and mixing see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we want to stress the difference between the effect of non - abelian and abelian family symmetries . considering any entry of a yukawa coupling matrix ,",
    "the latter ones allow this entry to be either arbitrary or zero .",
    "moreover , given any distribution of `` texture zeros '' in fermion mass matrices , there is always an abelian family symmetry and a scalar sector such that this distribution of `` texture zeros '' is reproduced by a symmetry @xcite . though exact maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing can not be enforced by abelian family symmetries , interesting models with @xmath27 can be produced @xcite .",
    "a suitable framework for constructing models with maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing is given by the sm supplemented by the seesaw mechanism and soft family - lepton number breaking @xcite .",
    "we denote these lepton numbers by @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "we allow for an arbitrary number @xmath30 of higgs doublets",
    ". then the lagrangian is given by @xmath31   + \\left ( \\frac{1}{2}\\ , \\nu_r^t c^{-1 } \\ !",
    "m_r^ * \\nu_r + \\mbox{h.c . }",
    "\\label{l}\\ ] ] the charged - lepton singlets are denoted by @xmath32 and the lepton doublets by @xmath33 .",
    "we have three right - handed neutrino singlets @xmath34 whose majorana mass matrix @xmath35 must be symmetric .",
    "the seesaw mechanism assumes that the scale @xmath36 of the mass eigenvalues of @xmath35 is much higher than the electroweak scale . with the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) @xmath37 , the mass matrix of the charged leptons and the so - called dirac mass matrix in the neutrino sector are , respectively , given by @xmath38 and the mass matrix of the light neutrinos is given by the seesaw formula @xcite @xmath39 the main points in our framework are the following :    * @xmath28-conservation @xmath40 @xmath41 , @xmath42 diagonal @xmath43 ; * soft @xmath28-breaking by terms of dimension three in @xmath44 , i.e. , by a non - diagonal @xmath35 .",
    "several remarks are at order :    1 .",
    "the theory introduced here is _",
    "renormalizable _ and all flavour - changing 1-loop amplitudes are finite .",
    "2 .   since the yukawa coupling matrices are diagonal , the mass matrices @xmath45 , @xmath2 are diagonal as well",
    "; therefore , @xmath35 is the only source of neutrino mixing .",
    "the soft @xmath28-breaking by @xmath34 mass terms occurs at the _ high _ scale @xmath36 , nevertheless this theory is in perfect agreement with the data , as shown in @xcite .",
    "this last point is connected with an interesting non - decoupling property @xcite in the scalar sector for @xmath46 in the limit @xmath47 : flavour - changing vertices @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is any neutral physical scalar of the theory , do not vanish in that limit , a property which stems from charged - scalar vertex corrections . as a consequence , the amplitude of , e.g. ,",
    "@xmath50 approaches a constant for large @xmath36 , suppressed by a product of four yukawa couplings ; though small , it might be within the reach of future experiment .",
    "on the other hand , amplitudes of @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , etc .",
    ", drop like @xmath54 and are completely inaccessible experimentally .",
    "the same happens for _ all _ flavour - changing amplitudes if @xmath55 .",
    "details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath24 model of @xcite is a model of the type described in the previous section , with three higgs doublets .",
    "the model is defined via the following family symmetries :    * @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) ; * @xmath58 : @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 ; * @xmath63    the groups @xmath56 are the groups associated with the lepton numbers , broken softly by the majorana mass terms of @xmath34 , which also break the total lepton number @xmath64 . the @xmath3@xmath4 `` interchange symmetry '' @xmath58 is broken by the vev of @xmath65 ; this breaking is necessary to allow for @xmath66 .",
    "the symmetry @xmath67 is an auxiliary symmetry which ensures that @xmath58 is intact in the neutrino sector at tree level .",
    "the model is dubbed @xmath24 model because of the @xmath58 symmetry .",
    "the yukawa lagrangian which follows from the above symmetries is given by @xmath68 for the problem of obtaining `` naturally '' @xmath69 with this @xmath70 see ref .",
    "@xcite .    as discussed before",
    ", an abelian group can not enforce _ exact _ maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing .",
    "indeed the symmetries listed in the beginning of this section generate a symmetry group which contains a non - abelian part because @xmath71 and @xmath58 do not commute and together these symmetries generate @xmath0 .",
    "the full symmetry group is given by @xcite @xmath72 in this equation the lepton numbers associated with the groups are indicated by subscripts .",
    "now the mass matrices in the neutrino sector of the @xmath24 model are readily found to be @xmath73 note the @xmath58 symmetry in these matrices , which via eq .",
    "( [ mnu ] ) is transferred to the mass matrix @xmath74 of the light neutrinos .",
    "the neutrino mixing matrix is found by the diagonalization procedure @xmath75 with positive neutrino masses @xmath76 .",
    "the key to the determination of @xmath12 is the observation that @xmath77 is an eigenvector of @xmath78 of eq .",
    "( [ mnuz2 ] ) , whence we also obtain @xmath79",

    "the phase @xmath86 is non - physical and can be absorbed into the charged lepton fields .",
    "there is no prediction for the masses from eq .",
    "( [ mnuz2 ] ) . however , by convention we always assume @xmath87 for the masses involved in solar neutrino oscillations .",
    "that the mass matrix ( [ mnuz2 ] ) does not predict the neutrino masses , follows easily from parameter counting .",
    "taking into account that two unphysical phases can be removed from eq .",
    "( [ mnuz2 ] ) , while preserving its form , we see that the matrix ( [ mnuz2 ] ) has six real physical parameters . on the other hand , we have three neutrino masses , three mixing angles and three physical phases , thus eq .",
    "( [ mnuz2 ] ) has three predictions , namely those for @xmath5 , @xmath13 and the ckm phase which vanishes by virtue of @xmath88 .",
    "consequently , parameter counting does not allow further relations .",

    "the family symmetry is the discrete group @xmath1 and the pairs @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 transform according to its 2-dimensional irreducible represenation .",
    "the auxiliary symmetry @xmath67 here is the same as for the @xmath24 model , however , we have a discrete @xmath94 version of the lepton numbers , such that @xmath95 together with the @xmath3@xmath4 interchange symmetry generate the @xmath1 .",

    "@xcite , from @xmath103 it follows that only the normal spectrum with @xmath104 is allowed .",
    "furthermore , @xmath103 induces two more relations among the physical quantities , namely the two majorana phases are determined by the light neutrino masses and the solar mixing angle .",
