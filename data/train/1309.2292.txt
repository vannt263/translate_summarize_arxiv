    "<S> we propose a theory of optical absorption in monolayer graphene - hexagonal boron nitride ( hbn ) heterostructures . in highly oriented heterostructures , </S>",
    "<S> the hbn underlay produces a long - range moir superlattice potential for the graphene electrons which modifies the selection rules for absorption of incoming photons in the infrared to visible frequency range . </S>",
    "<S> the details of the absorption spectrum modification depend on the relative strength of the various symmetry - allowed couplings between the graphene electrons and the hbn , and the resulting nature of the reconstructed band structure .    </S>",
    "<S> heterostructures of graphene with hexagonal boron nitride ( hbn ) feature moir patterns @xcite which are the result of the slight incommensurability of the periods of these two crystals , or of their misalignment . for dirac electrons in graphene , </S>",
    "<S> a periodic geometrical pattern in the atomic arrangement of the two superimposed honeycomb lattices translates into a hexagonal superlattice with the period @xmath0 , determined by the lattice constants @xmath1 of graphene and @xmath2 of hbn ( @xmath3 ) , and the misalignment angle @xmath4 . due to the bragg scattering from this long - period superlattice , dirac electrons in graphene </S>",
    "<S> acquire a miniband spectrum , which is reflected in tunneling @xcite and magnetotransport characteristics , including the recent observation of a fractal hofstadter spectrum in such heterostructures subjected to a strong magnetic field @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in general , there are three characteristic types of moir miniband structures for graphene electrons predicted by recent theories @xcite : miniband spectra without a distinct separation between the lowest and other minibands ; quite exceptionally , a case where the first miniband is separated from the next miniband by a triplet of secondary dirac points ( sdps ) in both of the graphene valleys ; and more generically , the case where a single sdp in the first miniband appears in one of the two inequivalent corners of hexagonal miniature brollouin zone ( mbz ) of moir superlattice . </S>",
    "<S> also , a generic moir superlattice potential violates the electron - hole symmetry in the otherwise symmetric dirac spectrum of graphene electrons , making the appearance of minibands different in the valence and conduction band sides of the graphene spectrum @xcite . in this paper , we investigate how these three chracteristic moir miniband types are reflected in the absorption spectra in the infrared to visible optical range . </S>",
    "<S> it has been noticed in recent tight - binding model studies @xcite that , as compared to the universal absorption coefficient @xmath5 per graphene layer , the absorption of light by dirac electrons in twisted two - layer graphenes ( which also feature a moir superlattice ) acquires the most robust features due to the edges and van hove singularities of the first minibands . </S>",
    "<S> these are affected by both the modulation of the density of states and the sublattice structure of the electron bloch states in graphene modified by the superlattice . here </S>",
    "<S> , we employ the recently proposed phenomenological theory of generic moir superlattices in graphene on hexagonal substrates @xcite to analyse the absorption spectrum of the modified dirac electrons , with a view to using optical transmission spectroscopy to narrow down the parameter set describing the moir superlattice in graphene - hbn heterostructures .    the phenomenological model for moir superlattices in graphene - hbn heterostructures is described by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath6   \\cdot { { \\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}\\xspace}}\\label{eq : ham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 the reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath8 are related by @xmath9 rotations , and @xmath10 . this hamiltonian acts on four - component wavefunctions @xmath11 describing the electron amplitudes on graphene sublattices @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( acted upon by pauli matrices @xmath14 ) and in the two principal valleys @xmath15 and @xmath16 , accounted for by @xmath17 respectively in </S>",
    "<S> the first term in is the unperturbed hamiltonian of graphene where @xmath18 is the momentum of the electron . among the other three contributions towards @xmath19 , </S>",
    "<S> the first describes a simple potential modulation ; the second the @xmath12-@xmath13 sublattice asymmetry , locally imposed by the substrate ; and the third the modulation of @xmath12-@xmath13 hopping associated with a pseudo - magnetic field . in each of these contributions , the first and second terms inside the round brackets </S>",
    "<S> respectively describe the inversion symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the moir perturbation . here </S>",
    "<S> , we use the energy scale @xmath20 , so that @xmath21 are dimensionless parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> the inversion - symmetric perturbation in determines a gapless miniband spectrum , with the sdp singularities either at the edge of the first miniband , or embedded into a continuous spectrum at higher energies , whereas the asymmetric part opens a ` zero - energy ' gap @xmath22 and gaps @xmath23 at the secondary dirac points in the conduction and valence bands ( @xmath24 respectively ) , @xmath25 however , recent transport experiments @xcite did not show any pronounced gap at the miniband edges , and either no gap @xcite or a small gap @xcite at zero energy ( @xmath26 ) , telling us that the inversion - asymmetric part of the moir superlattice potential is weak . </S>",
    "<S> this agrees with the ansatz made in reference @xcite that only one out of the two sublattices ( either n or b atoms ) of the honeycomb lattice of hbn top layer dominates in the coupling with the graphene electrons , thus making the effective lattice of the hbn perturbation simple hexagonal and prescribing inversion symmetry to the moir potential . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the following we assume that @xmath27 and neglect the inversion asymmetric terms in the analysis of optical absorption in the infrared - to - visible range .    </S>",
    "<S> besides the above described dominance of the inversion - symmetric part in the moir superlattice potential , very little is known for definite about the values of the superlattice parameters in . </S>",
    "<S> two microscopic models , based on either hopping between the graphene carbon atoms and the hbn atoms @xcite , or on scattering of graphene electrons by the quadropole electric moments of nitrogen atoms @xcite predict similar a relationship between coupling constants @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 in , @xmath31 with @xmath32 , to compare with @xmath33 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> however , rather simplistic approximations are used in these models , and one must assume much larger values of superlattice potential parameters to relate the theory to the recent magneto - transport data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that what these models show is that all three inversion - symmetric interaction terms in the hamiltonian in should be taken into account in a comprehensive phenomenological theory of moir superlattice in graphene - hbn heterostructures . </S>",
    "<S> having all this in mind , the purpose of the following analysis is to establish what characteristic features in the heterostructure absorption spectrum can be attributed to one or another combination of moir parameters , with a view to narrowing down their choice based on the combination of the transport data with the forthcoming optical studies . </S>",
    "<S> note that the deviation of the optical absorption by electrons in a heterostructure from the universal graphene absorption coefficient @xmath37 would be most pronounced in a spectral range around @xmath38 ( from infrared at @xmath39 to visible at @xmath40 ) : for much lower photon frequencies , electron states are almost the same as in the unperturbed dirac spectrum @xcite , whereas photons of much higher energies involve transitions between numerous overlapping minibands such that individual spectral features would be smeared out by the faster inelastic relaxation of photoexcited electrons and holes .    </S>",
    "<S> the coefficient of absorption of light described by energy @xmath41 and polarization @xmath42 is @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 stands for the miniband energy found by diagonalization of the hamiltonian in , @xmath46 are the occupation numbers , @xmath47 is the normalization area of the miniband plane wave states , and @xmath48 is the broadening of the energy states ( we take @xmath49 unless otherwise stated ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also find numerically the eigenstates of @xmath50 to calculate the matrix elements of the current operator , @xmath51 where @xmath52 are dirac current operators . </S>",
    "<S> the above equation gives the selection rules for optical transitions between the miniband states ( we neglect the momentum transfer due to absorption of the photon ) , and take into account the spin and valley degeneracy . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath53 symmetry of the moir pattern implies that there is no dependence of @xmath54 on the polarization angle of the light , and after taking into account the fact that the two valleys in the graphene spectrum are related by time - inversion symmetry , we conclude that the absorption spectrum is independent of the polarization state of photons .    , @xmath55 , and various misalignment angles . </S>",
    "<S> ( b)(d ) band structures corresponding to each of the spectra in ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have marked transitions responsible for the absorption maxima in ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : realpars ] ]    \\(a ) shows the features of the absorption spectrum when the fermi energy @xmath56 is at the dirac point , calculated for the realization of the moir superlattice with substantially sizeable amplitudes and the weight of parameters @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 set in . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the electron spectrum belongs to the most generic type : it features a sdp at the corner of the first miniband on the valence band side and overlapping bands on the conduction band side . </S>",
    "<S> it is strongly electron - hole asymmetric , which makes the spectral features of the superlattice less pronounced . </S>",
    "<S> the optically active transitions which provide the deviation from the standard absorption @xmath57 come from the edge of the mbz , as shown by the arrow in ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this figure also shows the tendency of the spectral features to stretch into higher energies and gradually decrease in size with increasing misalignment angle .    . </S>",
    "<S> ( b)(d ) the corresponding band structures with the transitions that make the strongest contribution to the labelled peaks in ( a ) marked with vertical arrows . </S>",
    "<S> ( e ) the change in the @xmath58 , @xmath59 double peak at @xmath60 with addition of weak @xmath29 and @xmath30 interaction terms . </S>",
    "<S> ( f ) the change in the @xmath61 , @xmath62 peak at @xmath63 due to the addition of strong electron - hole symmetry - breaking terms @xmath28 and @xmath30 . in ( e ) and </S>",
    "<S> ( f ) , we have @xmath64 . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : spectra ] ]    it is also instructive to analyse spectra for more peculiar realizations of moir superlattice , starting only with one of the three terms in the perturbation , and then increasing the size of the others . the corresponding evolution of the absorption spectra for @xmath65 is shown in ( a ) for each of the three interaction terms . </S>",
    "<S> the distinctive feature of a pure @xmath28 interaction [ black line , band structure shown in ( b ) ] is the double peak structure near @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> ( e ) shows the spectra for the same @xmath28 interaction with a small @xmath29 or @xmath30 interaction added for the frequency interval near the double peak . for both added interactions , each part of the double peak </S>",
    "<S> is split in two destroying this simple structure . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the most obvious identifying feature of a strong @xmath28 interaction is masked by even weak additions of the other two interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the red line in ( a ) is the spectrum for the @xmath61 interaction , with the associated band structure in ( c ) . </S>",
    "<S> there are two key features to this spectrum , the first being that the initial deviation from the standard @xmath57 result for low @xmath41 is downwards , not upwards as for the pure @xmath28 and @xmath30 interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the second key feature is the strong single peak at @xmath60 due to the electron - hole symmetry of the @xmath29 interaction allowing van hove singularities in both the valence and conduction bands to contribute to the absorption simultaneously , as indicated by the double arrow marked ` ( 1 ) ' in ( c ) . in ( f ) </S>",
    "<S> we show this peak with a strong mixture of the @xmath28 and @xmath30 interactions [ compare the size of the perturbation to that in ( e ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> for both additional interactions , the position of the peak has shifted a little and decreased slightly in height , but the peak is still clearly identifiable indicating that this spectral feature is rather robust against perturbation by the other two interactions . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the @xmath66 interaction is shown by the green line in ( a ) and the band structure in ( d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the identifying feature in this case is the small peak followed by a large frequency range where the absorption is suppressed substantially below the value of @xmath67 .    . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) optical absorption spectra when the conduction band has three sdps at the mbz edge . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) optical absorption spectra when the valence band has one sdp at the mbz corner . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) and ( d ) band structures associated with ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the horizontal coloured lines show the fermi energy for each of the spectra in ( a ) and ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : muvary ] ]    illustrates several examples of how the absorption spectrum would be modified by change in the carrier density ( and fermi energy @xmath56 ) in the heterostructure . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to unperturbed graphene ( where pauli blocking simply suppresses absorption at @xmath68 ) here , due to bragg scattering of electrons by the superlattice potential , empty states in higher minibands of the valence band or filled states in higher minibands of the conduction band open new absoption channels .    in conclusion , we have demonstrated that optical spectroscopy with infra - red and visible radiation may be used to gain insight into the detailed characterization of the interaction between layers in graphene - hbn heterostructures with a small misalignment angle . since the exact parameters of this interaction are unknown , we have described the general features of optical spectroscopy due to each of the interaction terms allowed by symmetry , and linked these parameters to the formation of secondary dirac points in the heterostructure spectrum and nearby van hove singularities in the moir miniband spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the modification of the optical transitions rules , due to the bragg scattering of graphene electrons off the moir superlattice , modify the doping dependence of graphene absorption spectrum , in a manner very sensitive to the detailed structure of moir superlattice potential .    </S>",
