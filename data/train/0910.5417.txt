    "precision measurements have played an important role in our understanding of the subatomic world .",
    "the discovery of anomalous magnetic moments is one early example , where the hyperfine structure of hydrogen ( hhfs ) was found to be too large for the standard theory to be correct  @xcite .",
    "the dirac equation  @xcite @xmath0 predicted a magnetic dipole moment ( mdm ) for the electron @xmath1 with the factor @xmath2 ( and @xmath3 ) .",
    "the increase in the hydrogen hyperfine levels could be interpreted as coming from an additional magnetic moment .",
    "motivated by the hhfs dilemma , schwinger  @xcite carried out the first `` loop '' calculation , and predicted that the electron had an additional ( anomalous ) magnetic moment @xmath4 the subsequent precision spectroscopy measurements of kusch and foley  @xcite obtained a measurement of @xmath5 that was in good agreement with schwinger s prediction .    in 1950 ,",
    "purcell and ramsey suggested that an electric dipole moment ( edm ) would violate parity invariance _",
    "p _ , and proposed to search for the neutron electric dipole moment  @xcite .",
    "this was of course the correct new - physics effect to look for , but in the wrong place .",
    "their initial experiment  @xcite achieved a limit of @xmath6 cm , a null result which has been pushed down to @xmath7 cm during the subsequent fifty - some years .",
    "it was realized in 1957  @xcite that an edm would also violate time - reversal symmetry , _ t _ , and by implication _",
    "cp_. presumably , new , as yet undiscovered sources of _ cp _ violation are responsible for the matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe , and would partially explain why we are here .",
    "other important examples of precision measurements are the search for charged lepton flavor violation ( neutrino mixing having already been discovered ) , precision mller scattering , neutron beta decay , rare or forbidden kaon decays , and the precision measurements of the muon anomalous magnetic moment .    in this paper",
    "i focus on magnetic and electric dipole moments , and on searches for charged lepton flavor violation ( clfv ) in the muon sector , which also may go though a dipole interaction .",
    "related papers at this conference are those by tom browder on _ cp _ violation and by dave hitlin , who discussed searches for clfv in the @xmath8 sector .",
    "as mentioned above , the dirac equation is inadequate to describe the measured magnetic moment of the electron . it is necessary to add a `` pauli '' term @xmath9 which in modern language is a dimension 5 operator that must arise from loops in a renormalizable theory .",
    "new physics ( np ) can also contribute through loops , with @xmath10 where @xmath11 , or @xmath12 in weak coupling loop scenarios .",
    "in the same spirit , one could add the following pauli - like term @xmath13 which represents the electric dipole moment interaction , where @xmath14 and the quantity @xmath15 plays the role for the edm that @xmath16 plays for the mdm .",
    "one way to parameterize the effects of np on @xmath17 and @xmath18 is by @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic current is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are dirac spinor fields and @xmath23 has the general lorentz structure @xmath24 with @xmath25 the electric charge , @xmath26 the anomalous magnetic moment , and @xmath27 the electric dipole moment .",
    "i will ignore the last term , the anapole moment .",
    "the anomalous part of the dipole moment interaction @xmath28u_{\\mu } \\label{eq : blr - dipole}\\ ] ] connects states of opposite helicity , i.e. it is chiral changing , giving it a unique sensitivity to np interactions , e.g. the sensitivity to @xmath29 in supersymmetric ( susy ) theories . in most susy models ,",
    "the contribution to @xmath30 depends on the susy mass scale , the sign of the @xmath31 parameter , and @xmath29 .",
    "a simple susy model with equal masses  @xcite gives the susy contribution as : @xmath32      the electron anomaly has been measured to a precision of 0.24 parts billion by storing a single electron in a quantum cyclotron and measuring the quantum cyclotron and spin levels in this system  @xcite . were an independent measurement of the fine - structure constant @xmath33 available at this precision , this impressively precise measurement could provide a testing ground for the validity of qed down to the five - loop level , and present an opportunity to search for effects of new physics .",
    "at present the best independent measurements of @xmath33 have a precision of @xmath34  ppb  @xcite . in the absence of such an independent measurement ,",
    "the electron @xmath35 value has been used , along with the qed theory ( assumed to be valid ) , to give the most precise value of @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "the muon anomaly , while only measured to an accuracy of 0.54 parts per million ( ppm )  @xcite , nevertheless has an increased sensitivity to heavier physics that scales as @xmath36 .",
    "this means that at a measurable level the standard - model contributions to the muon anomaly come from qed ; from virtual hadrons in vacuum polarization or hadronic light - by - light scattering loops ; and from loops involving the electroweak gauge bosons .    in principle",
    "the technique is similar to the measurement of the electron anomaly , where muons are stored in a `` trap '' consisting of a dipole magnetic field plus an electrostatic quadrupole field . in the muon experiment , an ensemble of muons",
    "is injected into a precision storage ring .",

    "there is a difference of @xmath42 between the two . if hadronic @xmath8 decays are used to determine the lowest - order hadronic contribution ( a determination that relies on significant isospin corrections ) the difference drops to @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "such a deviation could fit well with the expectations of supersymmetry in the few - hundred gev mass region , as shown in eq .",

    "the precision of the e821 @xmath35 measurement was limited by the statistical error of 0.46  ppm , compared to the systematic error of 0.28  ppm .",
    "a new experiment has been proposed for fermilab , p989",
    "@xcite with the goal of equal statistical and systematic errors , and a total error of 0.14 ppm , a factor of four improvement over e821 .    significant work on different aspects of the hadronic contribution are in progress , both on the experimental side to measure the hadronic electroproduction cross sections better , and on theoretical efforts to improve on the hadronic light - by - light contribution  @xcite .    the supersymmetry community has chosen a number of possible scenarios that might be discovered at lhc , the snowmass points and slopes  @xcite , which serve as benchmarks for determining the sensitivity to the susy parameters . since @xmath30 has significant sensitivity to @xmath29 ( see eq .",

    "the non - observation of a neutron edm restricts the value of @xmath49 : @xmath51 which for a quantity that could be order one is anomalously small , and is often referred to as the strong _ cp _ problem .",
    "while supersymmetry , or other models of new physics can easily contain new sources of _ cp _ violation , the absence of any observation of an edm , with a significant fraction of the `` natural '' part of the susy _",
    "cp_-violating parameter space already eliminated , is sometimes called the susy _ cp _ problem .",
    "the isovector and isoscalar combinations of the magnetic dipole moments are : @xmath52 we conclude that the isovector dominates the anomalous mdm .",
    "both isoscalar and isovector edms are predicted by various models  @xcite , so measuring both the proton and neutron edms would help disentangle these two possibilities .    in the traditional edm experiment , the system is placed in a region of parallel ( anti - parallel ) electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the larmor frequency is measured , and then the electric field direction is flipped .",
    "an edm would cause the larmor frequency to be higher / lower depending on the direction of the electric field .",
    "the edm is determined by the frequency difference between these two configurations : @xmath53    a new result from the seattle group places the limit on the edm of the mercury atom  @xcite : @xmath54 giving the limit above in table  [ tb : blr - edm ] .",

    "the motional electric field is proportional to @xmath61 , so the edm results in an out - of - plane component of the spin , where the ( very small ) tipping angle relative to @xmath62 is @xmath63 for spin @xmath64 , @xmath15 is related to the edm , @xmath18 , by the relationship @xmath65    in the @xmath35 experiments , @xmath66 and the resulting motion is an up - down oscillation with frequency @xmath67 , _ out of phase _ with the @xmath35 oscillation .",
    "such an experiment is largely limited by systematic errors  @xcite , since the out - of - plane motion is masked by the large - amplitude spin precession from the magnetic moment .",
    "nevertheless , the new fermilab effort hopes to achieve one to two orders of magnitude improvement in the muon edm as a by - product of the improved @xmath35 measurement .",
    "significant progress beyond that goal would need to reduce the large background caused by the @xmath67 precession .    to achieve this reduction ,",
    "the `` frozen spin '' technique has been proposed  @xcite .",
    "recall the point of choosing the magic @xmath68 in eq .",
    "[ eq : blr - omega ] was to eliminate the effect of the focusing electric field on the spin precession . if however , a storage ring were to be operated at a different momentum , then a _ radial _ electric field could be used to counter the the spin precession from the magnetic moment ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : blr - omega ] , _ viz . _",

    "the frozen spin technique , along with a very high - flux facility could permit a sensitivity of @xmath77 cm or better for the muon edm , providing a unique opportunity to measure the edm of a second generation particle .",
    "the error on such a measurement is given by  @xcite @xmath78 which implies that one needs @xmath79 for @xmath80  cm .",
    "the polarization enters directly into the asymmetry @xmath81 , thus the muon beam for the edm experiment must have high polarization .",

    "( modified from a figure courtesy of thomas schietinger),width=302 ]    in closing this section , one additional point needs to be made .",
    "should convincing evidence for any edm be found , it will be imperative that as many other edms as possible be measured to help sort out the source of this new _ cp _ violation .",
    "one of the most important discoveries in the past decade was the definitive evidence that neutrinos mix . in the standard model",
    ", this implies that charged leptons will also mix , and when one calculates the transition rate for @xmath82 one finds : @xmath83 which is immeasurable under the most optimistic scenario .",
    "thus the observation of any process that violates lepton flavor would herald the discovery of new physics .",

    "i confine myself to the muon sector , where possible reactions include : @xmath93    there is a long experimental history of searches for these reactions , going back to the search for @xmath91 in 1947 by hinks and pontecorvo  @xcite , who showed the branching ratio was less than 10% . in the intervening years",
    ", the limits for all these processes have been lowered to @xmath94 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : blr - limits ] .",
    "ambitious experiments planned or in preparation have goals of @xmath95 or below .",
    "a wide range of np could produce such transitions .",

    "[ eq : blr - mec ] . if negative muons are stopped in matter , they come to rest and get captured into atomic orbits in the stopping material .",
    "they then cascade down to the atomic @xmath96 state .",
    "ordinarily the @xmath97 either decay in orbit , or are captured weakly on the atomic nucleus , which is analogous to k capture of atomic electrons . in the coherent conversion to an electron with no neutrinos , the signal is a mono - energetic electron with an energy equal to the muon mass less the atomic binding energy of the muon in the ground state of the muonic atom .",
    "while this process is forbidden in the standard model , it is possible in a large number of standard - model extensions , some of which are shown diagrammatically in fig .",
    "[ fg : blr - mec ]        the muon - electron conversion ( mec ) is especially interesting because of the broad range of physics which it addresses .",

    "if the dipole dominates , then muon - electron conversion is suppressed by @xmath100 relative to @xmath91 , however , for the other operators , mec is much more sensitive .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fg : blr - mass - limits ] , where the sensitivity to different mass scales @xmath101 is shown as a function of the amount of the non - dipole contribution @xmath102  @xcite . while @xmath91 is much more sensitive if the dipole contribution dominates , for non - dipole interactions , the conversion experiment has an enormous mass reach , well beyond what could be imagined at colliders .",
    "the muon - electron conversion rate depends both on the operator , and on the nucleus  @xcite .",
    "if it becomes possible to measure mec for a range of nuclei , the @xmath103 dependence will help disentangle which operators are responsible .",
    "furthermore , the observation of several clfv processes will help further , perhaps along with the electric and magnetic dipole moment information .        at present",
    "there is one running experiment in the muon sector , the meg experiment at the paul scherrer institut , which aims for a sensitivity of @xmath104 for the process @xmath105 . of course , experimentally , this channel is quite challenging .",
    "the two - body final state uniquely determines the kinematics , so at rest the photon and electron are back - to - back , sharing the muon mass energy .",
    "however , photons in the 50  mev energy region are difficult to detect with good position and directional information on the photon .",
    "a preliminary result from meg reported a @xmath106 90% confidence level limit  @xcite , which is not yet competitive with the present limit of @xmath107  @xcite .",
    "the muon - electron conversion experiment is rather special , since the signal of a single mono - energetic electron is unique , and in principle resolved from background . the two proposals to study this process , mu2e at fermilab which advertises a first phase 90% cl limit @xmath108 , and comet at j - parc which proposes to reach a sensitivity of @xmath109 for its first phase .",

    "i have described a set of experiments from the precision / intensity frontier which have the potential impact equal to the discoveries we hope for , and expect to find at the lhc .",
    "the discovery of a permanent electric dipole moment would herald , at long last , a new source of _ cp _ violation that might explain the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe , and partially explain why we are here .",
    "the discovery of charged lepton flavor violation would also herald new physics at work in the lepton sector .",
    "a confirmation of the muon @xmath35 discrepancy would also signify new physics at the loop level .",
    "all of these experiments will help guide our interpretation of the new phenomena which we hope to discover at lhc .",
    "perhaps the most important message from this talk is that many different additional experimental results will be necessary to help guide our interpretation of the discoveries made at the lhc .",
