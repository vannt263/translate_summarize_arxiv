    "exciting prospects arise when photonic structures are switched on ultrafast timescales . for example , switching would allow the capture or release of photons from photonic band gap cavities @xcite , which is relevant to solid - state slow - light schemes @xcite . switching the directional properties of photonic crystals",
    "also leads to fast changes in the reflectivity , where interesting changes have been reported for bragg stacks @xcite , 2d photonic crystals @xcite , and first - order stop bands of 3d opaline crystals @xcite .",
    "ultrafast control of the propagation of light is essential to applications in active photonic integrated circuits @xcite .",
    "different mechanisms are possible for switching photonic structures . the switching of photonic structures with free carriers @xcite and a phase transition of @xmath1 @xcite have been reported recently .",
    "the disadvantage of a phase transition is that the material changes from a transparent material to a metal , which absorbs light . on the other hand",
    "free carrier excitation is ultrafast , but the recombination of the carriers is limited to a picosecond time scale .    with instantaneous switching it would be possible to ultimately control the on- and off - time of the switching event",
    "this is possible with the optical kerr effect , where the on- and off - time are determined by the pulse duration .",
    "this extreme of fast switching can be used for capturing and releasing photons on demand for example in a vertical - cavity surface emitting laser @xcite .    in order to release photons from cavity , the refractive index change induced with the optical kerr effect should be large enough . to shift the cavity resonance by one linewidth the refractive index change should be equal to @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "thus for an experiment with a cavity having a quality factor q of 1000 , this means a refractive index change of 0.1% .",
    "it is well known ( see @xcite ) that the magnitude of the refractive index change by the kerr effect is much smaller than the change due to a free carrier switch .",
    "a problem which occurs at coincidence of pump and probe pulse is non - degenerate two - photon absorption @xcite . here , a probe photon is absorbed together with a pump photon when the summed energy of the pump and probe exceed the bandgap energy .",
    "the change in imaginary part of the refractive index can be large compared to the change in the real part , giving rise to absorptive changes in the optical properties .    in this work",
    "we propose a method to decrease non - degenerate two photon absorption at pump and probe coincidence . because of this , we are able to show that the optical kerr effect is large enough to switch a cavity resonance with a moderate q of 1000 or higher .",
    "we derive the kerr coefficient and the three photon absorption coefficient over a broad wavelength range .",
    "our structure consists of a gaas @xmath3 thick layer ( 277 nm thick ) sandwiched between two bragg stacks consisting of 12 and 16 pairs of @xmath4 thick layers of nominally pure gaas or alas . the sample is grown with molecular beam epitaxy at 550@xmath5c to optimize the optical quality @xcite . for experiments outside the present scope",
    "the sample was doped with @xmath6@xmath7 ingaas / gaas quantum dots , which hardly influence our experiment @xcite .",
    "our setup consists of two independently tunable optical parametric amplifiers ( opa , topas ) , that are the sources of the pump and probe beams .",
    "the setup has been described in @xcite therefore we present only a brief outline here .",
    "the opas have pulse durations @xmath8 fs .",
    "the pump beam has a much larger gaussian focus of 113 @xmath9 m full width at half maximum than the probe beam ( 28 @xmath9 m ) , ensuring that only the central flat part of the pump focus is probed .",
    "a versatile measurement scheme was developed to subtract the pump background from the probe signal , and to compensate for possible pulse - to - pulse variations in the output of our laser @xcite .",
    "separately , continuous - wave ( cw ) reflectivity was measured with a broad band white light setup with a resolution of @xmath10 nm @xcite .    in this work we varied the pump wavelength from 2000 nm to 2400 nm in steps of 200 nm .",
    "the probe wavelength was varied independently of the pump wavelength between 1150 nm and 1650 nm , with steps of 5 nm .",
    "measured data was corrected for dispersion in the system .",
    "figure [ reflvsfreqbiorad]c shows the measured linear reflectivity spectrum of our sample and a transfer matrix ( tm ) calculation @xcite .",
    "the transfer matrix calculation including the dispersion of gaas @xcite and alas @xcite reproduces the experimental resonance , stopband , and fabry- prot fringes .",
    "the only free parameters in the model were the thicknesses of the gaas ( dgaas = 69.2 nm ) and alas ( dalas = 81.0 nm ) , which agree to the measured values .",
    "is the electronic bandgap of gaas , @xmath11 is the probe wavelength and @xmath12 is the pump wavelength .",
    "the edge between diagram a and b is at a probe wavelength of 1510 nm and 1340 nm at pump wavelengths of 2000 nm and 2400 nm respectively . in the dispersive spectral region",
    "the summed energy of a pump and a probe photon is smaller than the bandgap , while the summed energy is larger in the absorptive spectral region .",
    "we present measurements in the spectral region indicated with a square , to obtain a change in the real part of the refractive index .",
    "( c ) linear reflectivity spectrum and transfer matrix calculation of the gaas / alas structure . the trough at 980 nm is due to the cavity resonance of the lambda thick gaas layer .",
    "the hatched regions are based on a pump wavelength of 2400 nm .",
    "the slight difference in amplitude of the measured and calculated reflectivity on the red side of the stopband is caused by a small error in the normalization measurement.__,width=453 ]    the reflectivity spectrum shows the stopband with cavity resonance and fabry - prot fringes .",
    "the spectrum can be divided into two spectral regions , namely absorptive ( right , densely hatched ) and dispersive ( left , hatched ) , referring to the expected behavior if pump and probe coincide .",
    "the origin of the absorption is explained in figure [ reflvsfreqbiorad]a and [ reflvsfreqbiorad]b , which show schematic energy diagrams at coincidence of pump and probe .",
    "the regions are separated at a wavelength which corresponds to the bandgap at a pump wavelength of 2400 nm . in the densely hatched spectral region ,",
    "the pump and probe photon will be absorbed since the sum of the photon energies is higher than the bandgap of gaas . in the sparsely hatched ( dispersive ) spectral region",
    "however , the sum of pump and probe photon energies is not larger than the bandgap of gaas",
    ". therefore absorption is low in this region and behavior at coincidence is therefore mainly dispersive . only the real part of the refractive index _",
    "n _ changes .",
    "the origin of the dispersion is the optical kerr effect .",
    "there will be a change in the real part of the refractive index ( _ n _ ) , due to the pump field . the edge of the hatched regions in figure [ reflvsfreqbiorad]c will shift to the red at a pump wavelength of 2000 nm , indicating that we expect absorption in a large part of the spectrum .",
    "the behavior at coincidence is therefore mainly absorptive , meaning a change in the imaginary part of the refractive index , ( _ n  _ ) .",
    "we focus in this work on the spectral region indicated by the black rectangle . in this region",
    "we expect to observe effects of the optical kerr effect but only little absorption at 2400 nm pump wavelength , while we expect mainly absorption at 2000 nm pump wavelength .",
    "the two plots in figure [ fullrefl ] show the differential reflectivity measured at 2000 nm , @xmath13 = 90 @xmath14 ( a ) and 2400 nm , @xmath13 = 95 @xmath14 ( c ) pump wavelength as a function of probe wavelength and delay .",

    "cross cuts indicated by dashed lines in a and c are shown in figure b and d respectively .",
    "figure a and c show a fringe pattern indicating a shift of the fabry - prot fringes .",
    "the cross sections b and d show that the sign of the differential reflectivity at coincidence is different from the sign at positive delay.__,width=453 ]    a fringe pattern is visible in figure [ fullrefl]a and c for coincidence of pump and probe and for positive delay . figure [ fullrefl]b and d show cross sections of [ fullrefl]a and c. the sign difference of differential reflectivity between pump and probe overlap and positive delay is apparent and is a result from the fringe patterns at coincidence and positive delay , which are spectrally shifted with respect to each other .",
    "this indicates that the switch mechanism at coincidence is different from the free - carrier mechanism at positive delay .    at a pump wavelength of 2000",
    "nm we expect a change in _",
    "_ , since we are in the absorptive regime . at 2400 nm pump wavelength",
    "we expect a change in _",
    "n _ and a negligible change in _",
    "_ , since we are in the dispersive region ( see figure [ reflvsfreqbiorad ] ) .",
    "the differential reflectivity at positive delay is caused by excited free carriers .",
    "figure [ 3photonabs ] shows the power dependence of differential reflectivity ( @xmath16 ) at positive delay .        there is a linear relation between the differential reflectivity and the power cubed , as shown in figure [ 3photonabs ] .",
    "we therefore conclude that the differential reflectivity is caused by free carriers generated by a three photon absorption process .      the fringe pattern in figure [ fullrefl]a and [ fullrefl]c results from fabry - prot interferences within the stack forming the optical microcavity . a change in _",
    "n _ modifies the optical thickness of the gaas layers ; it induces a spectral shift of the fabry - prot fringes , which results in a periodic differential reflectivity . a change in _",
    "n  _ decreases the modulation depth of the fabry - prot fringes .",
    "the differential reflectivity due to a change in the real part of the refractive index depends on measured intensities as follows : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the differential reflectivity , @xmath19 is the delay between pump and probe , @xmath20 is the probe frequency , @xmath21 is the pump frequency , @xmath22 is the reflectance measured if the structure is unpumped and @xmath23 is the reflectance measured if the structure is pumped .    in case of a change in the real part of the refractive index , the fringe pattern shifts spectrally @xmath24 , with @xmath25 a proportionality constant that depends on the exact structure of the fringe pattern .",
    "@xmath23 is then given by : @xmath26 which can be written as @xmath27 which yields a differential reflectivity : @xmath28 equation [ eq : drrindepthnreal ] shows that in the case of a change in the real part of the refractive index a large differential reflectivity will be measured where the unpumped reflectivity has a large derivative , which is spectrally between successive maxima and minima of the fabry - prot fringes .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ 080610explaindrr ] .        in the case of a change in _",
    "n  _ the modulation depth of the fringe pattern is affected , while in the case of a change in _ n _ the position of the fringe pattern is shifted .",
    "for this reason the differential reflectivity has maxima at different positions making it possible to distinguish between a purely dispersive and a purely absorptive regime .",
    "figure [ drrvslambdainclureim ] shows a tm calculation of the differential reflectivity spectrum of the planar microcavity .",
    "the intensity profile in the structure is homogeneous , leading to a homogeneous refractive index change .",
    "the intensity profile is homogenous since we pump at a long wavelength in the three photon absorption regime .",
    "the homogeneity length ( @xcite ) is longer than our sample .",
    "( black solid circles ) showing the differential reflectivity @xmath16 as a function of probe wavelength at pump - probe coincidence ( @xmath29 ps ) .",
    "the structure was pumped at 2000 nm ( a ) and 2400 nm ( b ) .",
    "the solid and dashed lines are results from transfer matrix calculations . in (",
    "a ) the dashed line represents a change in the real part of the refractive index while the solid line represents a change in the imaginary part of the refractive index .",
    "this is the other way around in ( b ) : dashed represents a change in imaginary part , while solid represents a change in the real part of refractive index .",
    "as expected we see mainly a change in the imaginary part of the refractive index at 2000 nm pump and a change in _ n _ at 2400 nm .",
    "furthermore our model slightly deviates near the blue side of the spectrum .",
    "_ , width=302 ]    figure [ drrvslambdainclureim ] shows a comparison between the measured and calculated differential reflectivity pattern . comparing the measured and calculated patterns",
    "shows that the positions of the peaks and troughs in the differential reflectivity pattern near zero delay , are caused by a change in the imaginary part of the refractive index ( _ n  _ ) in the case of 2000 nm pump and a change in the real part of the refractive index ( _ n _ ) in the case of 2400 nm pump .",
    "we conclude that in the case of 2400 nm pump wavelength the fringe pattern near zero delay in the differential reflectivity originates from a kerr switch , since the process is ultrafast , instantaneous with the laser pulse and is dispersive . in case of 2000 nm",
    "pump wavelength the fringe pattern originates from non - degenerate two photon absorption .",
    "furthermore we see a slight deviation of our model near the blue side of the spectrum , indicating some dispersion in the nonlinear effect .",
    "we further conclude from figure [ drrvslambdainclureim ] that absorption can be neglected at 2400 nm pump wavelength , while dispersion can be neglected at 2000 nm pump wavelength .        by varying the size of the change in _",
    "n _ we extracted the change in refractive index at each wavelength .",
    "the results are plotted together with dispersion curves in figure [ dnnvslambdainclkerrdrude ] .",
    "figure [ dnnvslambdainclkerrdrude ] shows no change in refractive index for a negative delay ( a ) , a positive change for zero delay ( b ) and a negative change for positive delay ( c ) . furthermore there is a good agreement between the data and the dispersion of the optical kerr effect @xcite and the dispersion of the free carrier excitation @xcite .",
    "the scattered symbols deviating strongly from the theoretical model can be attributed to small differences in shape of the measured and calculated reflectivity spectrum .",
    "a slight deviation is amplified by the fitting procedure since we extract the refractive index change by fitting the differential reflectivity at one wavelength position .",
    "figure [ dnnvslambdainclkerrdrude]b shows that the change in refractive index induced by the optical kerr effect is in the order of 0.1% .",
    "this is large enough to switch a cavity with a moderate q of 1000 .",
    "the non - degenerate kerr coefficient @xmath30 can directly be extracted from the data @xmath31 in figure [ dnnvslambdainclkerrdrude ] using the relation @xcite , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the pump intensity .",
    "since @xmath34 scales with @xmath35 @xcite , the contribution of alas is only 20% of the total @xmath34 . for simplicity",
    "we therefore assume that mainly the gaas is switched .",
    "the resulting kerr coefficients are plotted in figure [ n2vsprobepump ] .     as a function of probe wavelength ( open circles ) .",
    "we averaged the data over the period of one fringe , since the coefficients are correlated within this fringe period ( solid squares ) .",

    "this dispersive behavior was already observed in figure [ drrvslambdainclureim ] .",
    "the values of @xmath34 measured in our non - degenerate pump - probe experiment are similar to the ones reported in the literature for degenerate pump - probe experiments @xcite .",
    "we find this surprising since we pump at a wavelength twice as long as in the degenerate case .",
    "this result enables us to modify efficiently the refractive index with a far detuned pump wavelength .",

    "our data are two orders of magnitude smaller than the values reported in the literature @xcite , measured with the z - scan method .",
    "we attribute this difference to the fact that our data have been obtained on an epitaxially - grown gaas / alas heterostructure , instead of a gaas wafer obtained with a different technique .",
