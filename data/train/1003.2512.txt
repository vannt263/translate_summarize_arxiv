    "we are mainly interested in compact connected oriented surfaces @xmath0 without boundary ( referred to , below , as the _ closed case _ ) or with connected boundary ( the _ bordered case _ ) . indeed ,",
    "when the surface @xmath0 has more than one boundary component , the study of homology cobordisms of @xmath0 by means of finite - type invariants is still possible , but it gets a little bit more complicated . since closed oriented @xmath4-manifolds can be presented by heegaard splittings ( or , alternatively , by open book decompositions with connected binding ) , the interactions between @xmath4-dimensional topology and mapping class groups are somehow contained in the closed case ( or in the bordered case ) .",
