    "the alice @xcite experiment at the lhc @xcite aims at studying the behaviour of nuclear matter at high energy densities and the transition to the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , expected to occur in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "cross section measurements in pp collisions are essential for the alice physics program : particle production in heavy - ion ( a  a ) collisions is often compared with the extrapolation from elementary pp collisions via binary scaling ( nuclear modification factor , @xmath0 ) .",
    "the precision on @xmath0 needed to quantify the importance of nuclear effects is typically @xmath110% .",
    "thus , a precision on the order of 5% or better on the pp cross section ( including luminosity normalisation ) is desired in order not to be dominant in the overall uncertainty .",
    "although it is not involved in @xmath0 , luminosity normalisation in pb ",
    "pb collisions is crucial for the measurement of other physics observables , e.g. in ultra - peripheral interactions .",
    "measurement of the cross section @xmath2 for a chosen reference process is a prerequisite for luminosity normalisation : for a given data sample , the corresponding integrated luminosity can be obtained from the number of reference process events @xmath3 in the sample as .",
    "reference cross sections can be measured in van der meer ( vdm ) scans @xcite , where the two beams are moved one across the other in the transverse direction .",
    "measurement of the rate @xmath4 of a given process as a function of the beam separation @xmath5 , @xmath6 allows one to determine the head - on luminosity @xmath7 as : @xmath8 where : @xmath9 is the number of colliding bunches ; @xmath10 is the number of protons per bunch in the two beams ; @xmath11 is the accelerator revolution frequency ; is the head - on rate ; @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the scan areas , defined as the area below the curve and the area below the curve , respectively . in the assumption that the beam profiles are gaussian",
    ", the scan area can be obtained via a fit .",
    "however , the gaussian assumption is not necessary for the validity of the method : thus , the scan areas can simply be obtained via numerical integration . the cross section @xmath2 for the chosen reference process",
    "can be obtained as .",
    "in this section , we report about three pp scans carried out at the lhc .",
    "the colliding system details for all scans are specified in table  [ tab : scans ] .    .colliding system details , measured vband cross sections and uncertainty sources for three pp vdm scans at the lhc .",
    "values in italic are preliminary . the different fill reproducibility uncertainty assigned to the may 2010 result originates from the discrepancy with the preliminary october 2010 result @xcite ( now obsolete ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the measured cross sections @xmath15 and @xmath16 are linear combinations of the hadronic and mutual electromagnetic dissociation cross sections : the coefficients , related to the zem efficiency for detecting mutual electromagnetic and hadronic interactions , have been estimated by simulation using hijing and reldis @xcite for the hadronic and the electromagnetic part respectively . using all the above information , @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be extracted : they are reported in table  [ tab : emd ] , compared to the reldis predictions , which are found to be in good agreement with our results .",
    "reference cross sections for luminosity normalisation have been measured by the experiment in van der meer scans at the lhc , in both pp and pb  pb collisions .",
    "the achieved precision is as good as 4% in pp collisions .",
    "such measurements allowed alice to obtain preliminary results for physical observables such as the pp inelastic cross section and the pb  pb electromagnetic dissociation cross sections .    9 k.  aamodt et al .",
