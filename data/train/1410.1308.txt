    "defect induced magnetism in carbon based materials gives many attractive perspectives in the fundamental understanding of magnetism as well as in future spintronic applications .",
    "as early as 2003 highly ordered pyrolytic graphite ( hopg ) was reported to be ferromagnetic after proton irradiation @xcite , which provides an approach to control the defect - induced magnetism in graphite both concerning strength and in lateral distribution .",
    "after that , successive investigations were performed for testing the reliability of the ferromagnetism in graphite @xcite and for finding other carbon - based ferromagnetic materials @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the investigation on defect induced magnetism in semiconductors has been greatly stimulated @xcite .",
    "so far experiments and theory show the following common features :    1 .",
    "paramagnetism can be greatly enhanced by introducing defects in graphite or graphene @xcite .",
    "some research groups conclude that these paramagnetic centers do not show any magnetic ordering down to 1.8 or 2 k @xcite .",
    "ferromagnetism only appears under certain defect concentrations , i.e. , in a narrow ion fluence window , and the magnetization is weak @xcite .",
    "3 .   in a microscopic picture , it has been found both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite that defect - induced or disturbed electron states play an important role in generating local moments in graphite .",
    "foreign ( or impurity ) atoms , particularly , hydrogen and nitrogen , are helpful in establishing the ferromagnetic coupling between defects @xcite .",
    "however , as to our knowledge , the research has focused mostly on thin - film like samples : ion implanted graphite with nm@xmath0 m affected thickness or graphene flakes .",
    "the as - measured magnetization is always in the range of 10@xmath110@xmath2 emu per sample @xcite .",
    "the small magnetization renders data interpretation controversial as shown in a recent intensive discussion on the potential contamination in graphite @xcite as well as on artificial effects in magnetometry @xcite .",
    "moreover , the implanted ions , especially those that differ chemically from the substrate , will stay in the matrix as foreign atoms and an interface will naturally form between the implanted region and the untouched substrate .",
    "both the interface and the implanted ions will make it difficult to unambiguously identify the defect type and hamper the interpretation of the mechanism for the observed magnetization . to avoid these problems we use neutron irradiation .",
    "neutrons have a much stronger penetrating capability than ions and will generate defects throughout the whole sample . in this way ,",
    "the foreign ion effect and the interface effect can be excluded in the present study .",
    "therefore , the application of neutron irradiation could be a promising method to clarify the long standing question regarding the origin of the defect induced magnetism in graphite in the following aspects .    *",
    "to verify whether the defect induced paramagnetism or ferromagnetism is a bulk effect or only a surface effect ; * to make a correlation between magnetism and defects based on the strong magnetic signal and results from various structural analysis techniques .",
    "accordingly , our work has been performed in the following way .",
    "hopg specimens were subjected to neutron irradiation , whereby the irradiation fluence is varied to induce defects in graphite from slight damage to near amorphization .",
    "the magnetic and structural properties have been measured by various techniques .",
    "the results were complemented with a theoretical interpretation of the role of in - plane defects from literature and from new first - principles calculations of magnetic states of trans - planar divacancy configurations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii all experimental methods employed will be described .",
    "then the results will be presented in three sub - sections . in section iii.a , we present the large paramagnetism induced by irradiation and its dependence on the neutron fluence . in section iii.b and c , the defect type and its concentration evolution will be discussed based on raman and x - ray absorption spectroscopy , respectively . in section iv",
    ", we attempt to correlate the induced paramagnetic centers with in - plane vacancies and trans - planar defects by reviewing the literature data as well as by first - principles calculations . in the end of the discussion section , we also explain why the magnetic coupling between the induced moments is missing .",
    "the paper is finished with a short conclusion .",
    "in the experiment , the used graphite samples were highly oriented pyrolytic graphite ( hopg ) with a grade of zya , which are generally referred as graphite in this manuscript .",
    "neutron irradiation was performed at the reactor ber ii ( position dbvk ) at helmholtz - zentrum berlin @xcite . during irradiation",
    "the temperature of the samples was less than 50 @xmath3c ( see ref . ) .",
    "four samples were irradiated with the fluences of 6.24@xmath410@xmath5 , 1.25@xmath410@xmath6 , 6.24@xmath410@xmath6 , and 3.12@xmath410@xmath7 @xmath8 , which are named as 3h , 6h , 30h and 150h according to the irradiation time of 3 hours , 6 hours , 30 hours , 150 hours , respectively .",
    "the mechanism to produce crystal lattice defects by neutron irradiation is the elastic or inelastic scattering between neutrons and target nuclei .",
    "if the target nucleus gets enough energy after scattering , it will irreversibly displace the lattice atom from its original site , resulting in vacancies and interstitials .",
    "the minimum energy required to displace a carbon atom in graphite is around 25 ev @xcite .",
    "therefore , we only consider the epithermal ( 0.5 ev  100 kev ) and fast neutrons ( 100 kev  20 mev ) @xcite in calculating the fluence .",
    "the elastic scattering dominates when the energy is below 5.5 mev in carbon and the nuclear reaction ( inelastic scattering ) only becomes appreciable when the energy is above 9 mev @xcite .",
    "magnetometry was performed using a squid - vsm ( quantum design ) .",
    "the magnetic properties were measured regarding their dependences on magnetic field and on temperature .",
    "the structure change is characterized by raman spectroscopy which is sensitive to defects in the aromatic ring , the edge state , the hybridization type , the interstitial ions , and also to the stacking orders , etc @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-raman system is equipped with a 532 nm wavelength laser and a liquid nitrogen cooled ccd detector working in backscattering geometry .",
    "x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) will further detect the bonding state change resulting from neutron irradiation .",
    "the variations of the magnetization , the raman scattering and the x - ray absorption at the carbon k - edge depending on the irradiation fluence allow us to clearly correlate the density of vacancies interstitials with the magnetism in the neutron irradiated graphite .",
    "figure [ figfm_graphite ] shows the magnetization measurements at 300 k and 1.8 k for the virgin and irradiated graphite without any background correction . for the virgin graphite ,",
    "the diamagnetic background dominates the magnetic properties .",
    "a weak ferromagnetic hysteresis is observed already in the virgin graphite .",
    "it is probably caused by intrinsic defects @xcite or by fe contamination @xcite .",
    "moreover , the ferromagnetic contribution is not changed significantly upon neutron irradiation .",
    "therefore , this weak ferromagnetism is not the topic of our study in this manuscript . besides the marginal change in the ferromagnetic component , there is a huge increment of the magnetization at low temperature .",
    "figure [ figfm_graphite](b ) shows the comparison of the magnetization measurement at 1.8 k for the virgin graphite and sample 150h .",
    "sample 150h shows a large paramagnetic component which will be discussed in detail later .",
    "note that the change in the slope of the mh curves in fig .",
    "[ figfm_graphite](a ) is due to the large increase of the paramagnetism upon irradiation as shown . at low temperature ,",
    "the weak ferromagnetism in the irradiated samples is dominated by the paramagnetism and not resolvable .",
    "the field dependence of the magnetization at 1.8 k for all samples is shown in fig .",
    "[ figmh_graphite ] .",
    "neutron irradiation leads to strong paramagnetism .",
    "the graphite sample is changed completely from diamagnetic - like to paramagnetic - like with increasing neutron fluence . however , even for the sample with the highest neutron fluence , the magnetization is not saturated at 1.8 k up to a field of 50000 oe . in our experiment ,",
    "the measured absolute magnetic moment for a graphite sample of around 4@xmath44 mm@xmath9 is in the range of 0.001 - 0.01 emu at 1.8 or 5 k. this value is much larger than the previously reported ion implanted samples with a magnetic moment of around 10@xmath210@xmath1 emu @xcite and is far above the sensitivity of squid - vsm . as shown in fig .",

    "the brillouin function provides excellent fits for j = 0.5 , which corresponds to single electrons as charge carries and @xmath15 = 8@xmath410@xmath7 @xmath12/mg for sample 150h . the fits using larger _",
    "j _ unequivocally deviate from the shape of the measured m - h curves , as they give significantly different , sharper changes with faster saturation .    the curie law @xmath16 with @xmath17 = 0.5 and @xmath18 = 8@xmath410@xmath7 @xmath12/mg inferred from fig .",

    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2fit_graphite](b ) shows the inverse susceptibility versus temperature , revealing a linear , purely paramagnetic behavior with no indication of magnetic ordering .",
    "figure [ fig5mvsraman ] ( shown later in the paper ) shows the density of paramagnetic centers obtained by fitting the magnetization measured at 1.8 k for different samples as a function of neutron fluence in double logarithmic scale . with increasing neutron fluence , i.e. the amount of defects , more and more paramagnetic centers are generated",
    "this indicates that even the most strongly irradiated sample is still not totally amorphous .",
    "we also noted the work by ramos et al .",
    "@xcite using ion implantation to introduce defects into graphite , they reported an anomalous paramagnetic contribution .",
    "this contribution remains independent of temperature up to 100 k , whereas the field dependent magnetization shows neither saturation nor any nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "meanwhile theoretical calculations also pointed out that if sufficient carbon adatoms were available , they could weakly agglomerate in graphene and superparamagnetism can be finally observed @xcite . however , in our experiment the magnetic properties for all samples can be well described by spin 1/2 paramagnetism without superparamagnetic contributions .",
    "as expected if the whole volume contributes , in our experiment the as - measured magnetization signal is as large as 0.0010.01 emu per sample .",
    "the large magnetization signal allows us to draw reliable conclusions and to exclude any spurious and anomalous paramagnetic contribution .         versus@xmath19 .",
    "the lines with different color correspond to the measurements in the temperature range 1.8 to 20 k. ]    to further exclude a possible ferromagnetic ordering in our sample we measured the magnetization vs. field at different temperature to perform an arrott plot analysis @xcite .",
    "this method is usually used to accurately determine the curie temperature @xmath20 and to verify the paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition .",
    "such an analysis is based on the relationship derived by wohlfarth @xcite @xmath21^{2 } = [ m(0,0)]^{2}[1-(t / t_c)^{2}+2\\chi_0h / m(h , t)]\\ ] ] note that this relationship results in parallel lines of the isothermal @xmath22 which cross zero ( @xmath23 ) in the vicinity of @xmath24 .",
    "figure [ figarr ] shows the isothermal magnetization arrott plot for sample 150h ( irradiated up to the highest fluence ) .",
    "the measurement temperatures range from 1.8 k to 20 k. with increasing temperature , the magnetization decreases , but none of the lines crosses the zero point ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "it confirms that down to 1.8 k no magnetic order appears in this sample .",
    "it is purely paramagnetic .",
    "figure [ fig4raman ] shows the raman spectra of graphite samples after neutron irradiation . from top to bottom are the virgin sample and samples 3h ... 150h , respectively .",
    "a linear background has been removed .",
    "the reference sample shows the peaks typical for the high - quality hopg @xcite .",
    "peak located at around 1590 @xmath25 corresponds to the inherent _ _ e__@xmath26 mode of the aromatic ring .",
    "peak around 1360 @xmath25 represents an elastic scattering at defects in crystal @xcite .    upon neutron irradiation ,",
    "the most pronounced changes occur in the _ d _ peak and in its overtone _",
    "g _ peak ( 2d peak ) : the _ d _ peak rises with irradiation fluence and becomes as strong as the _ g _ peak .",
    "two pronounced changes will be described in the following .",
    "the increase of peak _ d _ is generally attributed to the in - plane vacancies in graphite @xcite . by independent methods such as x - ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy , the intensity ratio between _ d _ and _",
    "g _ peaks has been confirmed as a measure of the in - plane grain size .",
    "neutron irradiation induces a large number of interstitial and vacancy pairs ( _ i - v _ ) .",
    "most of _ i - v _ defects will recombine simultaneously and the remaining species can form various defects . since a high energy barrier blocks the diffusion of vacancies , most vacancies become in - plane vacancies or form vacancy clusters .",
    "the interstitial atoms prefer staying in the region between the layers owing to the energetically highly unfavorable interstitial in - plane position @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig5mvsraman ] , we plot the fluence dependent i@xmath27/i@xmath28 ( the intensity ratio between _ d _ and _ g _ peaks ) . in our samples , the strength of the _ d _ peak increases with the neutron fluence when the irradiation time is less than 30 hours .",
    "further increasing the neutron fluence , i@xmath27/i@xmath28 reaches a saturation value .",
    "it indicates that with increasing the irradiation time from 3 hours to 30 hours the density of vacancies is continuously increasing until the vacancies reach a saturation density . such behavior was observed in ion irradiated or ball milled graphite @xcite .",

    "g1 _ and _ g2_. when the irradiation time is less than 6 hours , two peaks can fit the spectra , but their strength becomes weak with increasing irradiation fluence .",
    "this indicates a slight crystalline damage in the graphene sheet stacking .",
    "the influence of shear moments caused by the interstitial atoms between the two sheets is less notable for irradiation times of less than 6 hours . when the irradiation time is over 30 hours , _",
    "g1 _ and _ g2 _ peaks decease strongly and mix into a single weak peak .",
    "this is attributed to the out - of - plane defects in graphite @xcite . with increasing neutron fluence ,",
    "more interstitial atoms are assumed to diffuse into regions between the graphene sheets so that the distance between the sheets increases strongly enough , such that the graphene sheets behave like an isolated single graphene sheet .",

    "interestingly , these transplanar defects seem also contribute to the total magnetization .      to further probe the change in the electronic state in graphite after neutron irradiation from a microscopic point of view",
    ", we performed near - edge x - ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy ( nexafs , beamline 6.3.1 at the advanced light source in berkeley ) .",

    ", there is no significant change either in the peak intensity or in the peak shape compared with the virgin sample .",
    "after the irradiation over 30 hours , the intensity of the @xmath32 peak decreases , which indicates that the aromatic @xmath34 system is severely perturbed . at the same time",
    ", the @xmath32 and @xmath33 features are becoming broader .",
    "in previous literature , it has been shown that the @xmath32 and @xmath33 resonances of carbon are much more broadened in proton implanted graphite than our case @xcite .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig6xas ] shows a zoom into the energy range 280284 ev .",

    ", a new small , but sizeable peak in the pre - edge region ( 281.5 ev to 284.5 ev ) , has been reported in ion implanted ferromagnetic graphite .",
    "this new peak was attributed to be closely related with defect states near the fermi energy level , and it was temporarily assigned to rehybridized c - h bonds .",
    "the lack of rehybridized c - h bonds in our samples may explain the absence of ferromagnetism , which will be discussed later .",
    "we have investigated the magnetic and structural properties of graphite after neutron irradiation .",
    "different from ion implantation , neutron irradiation can introduce defects in the whole graphite sample .",
    "the resulting magnetization is very large and allows one to draw a reliable conclusion free of the influence of contamination .",
    "our experimental results lead to two conclusions : ( 1 ) only spin 1/2 paramagnetism is induced in graphite by neutron irradiation ; and ( 2 ) both in - plane vacancies and out - of - plane defects appear after irradiation . in this discussion , we attempt to correlate the magnetization and defects and to understand why the magnetic ordering is lacking .      defect induced magnetism in both graphite and graphene has been intensively investigated theoretically .",
    "structural defects , in general , can give rise to localized electronic states .",
    "it is well accepted that the in - plane vacancies are the origin of local magnetic moments @xcite . upon removal of one atom ,",
    "each of the three neighboring atoms has one @xmath35 dangling bond .",
    "two of the c atoms can form a pentagon , leaving one bond unsaturated .",
    "this remaining dangling bond is responsible for the magnetic moment .",
    "moreover , the flat bands associated with defects lead to an increase in the density of states at the fermi level .",
    "lehtinen et al . , used spin - polarized dft and demonstrated that vacancies in graphite are magnetic @xcite .",

    "zhang et al .",
    "@xcite have confirmed that the local moments appear near the vacancies and with increasing vacancy accumulation the magnetization decreases non - monotonically . using a combination of a mean - field hubbard model and first principles calculations , yazyev also confirmed that vacancies in graphite and graphene can result in net magnetic moments @xcite , while the preserved stacking order of graphene layers is shown to be a necessary condition for achieving a finite net magnetic moment of irradiated graphite . in most calculations ,",

    "@xcite who firstly propose the trans - planar divacancy configurations ( see figure [ figdft ] ) that breaks the symmetry rules in graphite .",
    "interestingly , the spin - polarized states for these defects was discussed in the paper but never assessed . in order to answer this question without any artifacts",
    "we have decided to run additional spin - polarized calculations in a super - cell which is large enough to avoid elastic effects between neighboring defect images ( in - plane ) .",

    "the distance between the two sheets was fixed to 6.45 bohr radii ( @xmath39 ) for simplifying the treatment of the interlayer .",
    "this is achieved by the freezing of the perpendicular displacements in a band close to the edges of the super - cell ( pink area in fig .",
    "[ figdft ] ) .",
    "this treatment allows for a full relaxation both in - plane and out - of - plane of the central part of the super - cell where the defect sits .",
    "the pbe exchange and correlation function was chosen as it was found to well reproduce the in - plane relaxations @xcite .",
    "the bigdft @xcite code was used to perform dft calculations within surface boundary conditions @xcite .",

    "this situation is different for the v@xmath41 divacancy : the inter - planar c - c bond is longer and more twisted , thus preventing further hybridization between the two carbon atoms . as a consequence",

    "after irradiation even to the largest fluence , the samples are not fully amorphous and @xmath36/@xmath37 of around 1.2 corresponds to a planar grain size of 3.5 nm @xcite",
    ". why is the magnetic interaction between the generated paramagnetic centers then missing ? to answer this question , we first need to estimate the density of defects , i.e. the average distance between adjacent local moments .    assuming the defects are homogeneously distributed in the sample matrix",
    ", we estimate the average distances ( @xmath45 ) between local moments in our irradiated graphite samples .",
    "this value amounts to 2.2 nm for the sample with the largest neutron fluence .",
    "the nearest average distance between two spins is around 16@xmath46 ( @xmath46 = 0.14 nm is the c - c bond length ) .",
    "therefore , the direct coupling between the localized spins at the vacancies is nearly negligible .",
    "alternatively , the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) coupling is suggested to appear in defective graphite and graphene @xcite .",

    "all these moments may tend to be ferromagnetically coupled via the rkky coupling , although the curie temperature can be very low @xcite .",

    "it is not practical to further increase the defect density , since the stacking order of graphenes plane must be preserved @xcite .",
    "our sample with the highest neutron fluence is already at the verge of amorphization .",
    "a larger irradiation fluence will perturb the graphene lattice too much and destroy the necessary band structure and carrier density .",
    "both published theory and experimental results suggest a crucial role of hydrogen or nitrogen chemisorption in enhancing the spin density and in establishing the magnetic coupling @xcite .",
    "all these moments from chemisorption will tend to be ferromagnetically coupled , enhancing the curie temperature by the rkky coupling .",

    "neutron irradiation in graphite can induce a large amount of defects throughout the bulk specimens , consequently leading to a large measurable magnetization .",
    "this approach allows for a revisiting of defect induced magnetism in graphite by eliminating the influence of contamination or artificial effects .",

    "<S> we have investigated the variation in the magnetization of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite ( hopg ) after neutron irradiation , which introduces defects in the bulk sample and consequently gives rise to a large magnetic signal . </S>",
    "<S> we observe strong paramagnetism in hopg , increasing with the neutron fluence . </S>",
    "<S> the induced paramagnetism can be well correlated with structural defects by comparison with density - functional theory calculations . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the in - plane vacancies , the trans - planar defects also contribute to the magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of any magnetic order between the local moments is possibly due to the absence of hydrogen / nitrogen chemisorption , or the magnetic order can not be established at all in the bulk form . </S>"
