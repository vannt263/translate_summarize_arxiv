    "motivated by this discovery that satellite galaxies appear to preferentially live in phase - space correlated structures , @xcite set out to search for similar structures on a lg scale .",
    "they have discovered that all but one of the 15 lg dwarf galaxies more distant than 300kpc from the mw and m31 are confined to two narrow ( short - to - long axis ratios of @xmath2 ) and highly symmetric planes , termed lgp1 and lgp2 .",

    "is perseus i a member of one of the two non - satellite galaxy planes in the lg ?    to determine whether perseus i lies close to one of the two lg planes as reported by @xcite ( see for example their table 3 ) , we adopt the position and distance modulus of perseus i from table 1 of @xcite . in the cartesian coordinate system of @xcite , this places persues i at @xmath21kpc , with a position - uncertainty along the line connecting perseus i and the sun of 65kpc .",
    "perseus i indeed lies in the vicinity of one of the planes , lgp1 ( offset by @xmath22kpc , compared to the plane s root - mean - square [ rms ] height of @xmath23kpc ) , as defined by the dwarf galaxies ugc 4879 , leo a , leo t , phoenix , tucana , wlm , cetus , ic 1613 and andromeda xvi .",

    "it is therefore more likely that andromeda xvi belongs to the gpoa rather than the lgp1 . removing it from the plane - fit results in a rms height of @xmath26kpc ; short - to - long axis ratio of @xmath27  and intermediate - to - long axis ratio of @xmath28 ; offset from mw of @xmath29kpc and from m31 of @xmath30kpc .",

    "perseus i is at a considerably smaller offset ( @xmath34kpc ) from this plane fit than from the one including andromeda xvi .",

    "[ fig : lgplanes ] , while those at the top and bottom are offset to the left .    the significance of a satellite galaxy plane can be tested by comparing the observed distribution with an expected one , which in most cases is assumed to be isotropic . due to the existence of a preferred axis in the lg ( the mw ",
    "m31 line ) , this comparison can not be easily adopted for planes spanning the whole lg .",
    "a proper determination of the plane significance therefore requires an expected model for the distribution of the non - satellite galaxies in the lg , which is not available .",
    "furthermore , such a test has to take observational biases like the sky coverage of surveys searching for lg dwarf galaxies into account . due to the very inhomogeneous nature of the galaxy data ,",
    "this is currently not feasible .",
    "we nevertheless try to get a rough estimate for how likely it is to find two similarly thin planes of non - satellite galaxies in the lg . assuming that andromeda xvi is part of the gpoa , we use the following 15 lg dwarf galaxies for this test : andromeda xviii , andromeda xxviii , aquarius , cetus , ic 1613 , leo a , leo t , ngc 6822 , pegasus dirr , perseus i , phoenix , sagittarius dirr , tucana , ugc 4879 and wlm . instead of assuming a model for the expected galaxy distribution , we generate 1000 randomised realisations by rotating each of the dwarf galaxy positions by individual random angles around the mw  m31 axis .",
    "this preserves their distances from both the mw and from m31 . for each realisation , we then proceed as follows .",
    "ignoring one of the lg galaxies ( analogously to ignoring the pegasus dirr galaxy which is neither part of lgp1@xmath5  consisting of 9 dwarf galaxies nor of lgp2 consisting of 5 dwarf galaxies ) , we split the remaining galaxies into two samples , constructing all possible combinations of 9:5 objects .",
    "planes are then fitted to both samples for each of these combinations .",
    "both planes rms heights @xmath17  and axis ratios @xmath18  are recorded for all 30030 possible combinations for each of the 1000 realisations . due to the large number of possible combinations we refrain from varying the observed galaxy distances within their uncertainties and only use the most - likely values .",
    "we then test how many of the randomised galaxy distributions contain planes which are similarly thin ( @xmath45kpc ) or have similar axis ratios ( @xmath46 ) as the observed lgp1@xmath5 .",
    "the mean of the minimum rms height for the 9-galaxy combinations over all realisations is 83 kpc , with a standard deviation of 22 kpc , while the mean minimum axis ratio is 0.140 , with a standard deviation of 0.037 .",
    "thus , on average a plane of galaxies as narrow as the lgp1@xmath5  is not expected .",
    "of the 1000 realisations , 29 ( 2.9 per cent ) contain a group of 9 galaxies which can be fitted by a plane with a rms height at least as small as that of lgp1@xmath5 . only 10 ( 1.0 per cent ) can be fitted by a plane with a sufficiently small axis ratio .",
    "if we simultaneously require that five out of the remaining six galaxies can be fitted by a plane having a similar rms height or axis ratio as lgp2 ( @xmath47kpc , @xmath48 ; @xcite ) , a situation similar to the one observed in the lg occurs in only 13 ( 1.3 per cent , rms height criterion ) or three ( 0.3 per cent , axis - ratio criterion ) of the 1000 random realisations .",
    "this test demonstrates that the lg planes are unexpected .",
    "we have not tested for the symmetry of the planes and their alignments , and varying the galaxy positions by only rotating them around the mw ",
    "m31 axis has a large chance of preserving information on the possible lg planes because they are parallel to the mw  m31 line .",
    "our results should therefore be considered as upper limits .",
    "in addition to the structures that dwarf galaxies trace in the lg , their internal kinematics are also of interest .",
    "these objects are generally inferred to be dark matter dominated , though there was no reason to anticipate this a priori .",
    "lcdm models can be constructed to match this observation , but do not provide the ability to predict the velocity dispersion of any particular dwarf .",
    "in contrast , it is possible to predict a dwarf s velocity dispersion given its photometric properties using mond .",
    "we employ here the method described by @xcite .",
    "being quite remote from m31 ( 374kpc ) , perseus i is well into the isolated deep mond regime for which the characteristic velocity dispersion follows directly from the stellar mass ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "this makes it one of the best test cases among the dwarfs of andromeda .",
    "most ( though not all ) of the other dwarfs are in the regime dominated by the external field effect so that the predicted velocity dispersions are less certain as they depend on the properties of m31 as well as those of the dwarfs themselves ( see * ? ? ? * ) .    given the luminosity reported by @xcite , we predict that perseus i should have a velocity dispersion of @xmath50 . for consistency with @xcite",
    "we assume a stellar mass - to - light ratio of @xmath51 , the first uncertainty reflects a factor of two variation in mass - to - light ratio while the second propagates the stated observational uncertainties .",
    "predictions of this type have proven largely successful so far @xcite ; perseus i provides another opportunity to test this a priori prediction of mond .",
    "there exist two other dwarf spheroidals in the local group that are far removed from both the milky way and andromeda : cetus and tucana .",
    "being far from major perturbers , they should also be in the isolated mond regime , and provide correspondingly good tests .",
    "however , they tend to be overlooked since they are not grouped together with the dwarfs that are obvious satellites . applying the same procedure described above given the luminosities and most - likely distances tabulated by @xcite",
    ", we predict for cetus @xmath52 and for tucana @xmath53 .",
    "as before , the first uncertainty represents the range of mass - to - light ratios @xmath54 .",
    "the second uncertainty represents the effect of the stated uncertainty in luminosity on the velocity dispersion for the nominal assumed mass - to - light ratio of @xmath55 . any systematic error in distance",
    "will have a strong effect , since @xmath56 .",
    "the predicted velocity dispersions of both cetus and tucana compare poorly with observed values .",
    "@xcite observe @xmath57 for cetus and measure @xmath58 for tucana .",
    "the observed values are a factor of @xmath59 and 3 higher than predicted , respectively . in terms of formal significance ,",
    "the observed velocity dispersions are @xmath60 ( cetus ) and @xmath61 ( tucana ) above the predicted range .",
    "the velocity distributions of cetus and tucana are not particularly well described as gaussians , so it is not obvious how to interpret their fitted velocity dispersions and uncertainties .",
    "the errors on the velocities of individual stars are typically @xmath62 , so the velocity dispersions predicted here would not be resolved : improved observations are warranted . nevertheless , in the absence of systematic errors , either in the overestimation of the velocity dispersion or the underestimation of the luminosity , these two dwarfs are problematic for mond .    after the above text was written but shortly before we submitted this paper , @xcite reported new observations of cetus .",
    "they measure a velocity dispersion of @xmath63 .",
    "this agrees well with our prediction of @xmath64 .",
    "the dwarf galaxy leo p has recently been discovered in the vicinity of the lg by the alfalfa survey @xcite . it can be considered to be a member of the ngc 3109 association of galaxies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , consisting of ngc 3109 , antlia , sextans a and sextans b. @xcite have shown that leo p s position and velocity is consistent with it belonging to the highly elongated , essentially linear association , as was also noted by @xcite .",
    "given the existence of correlated satellite galaxy planes and the recent discovery that essentially all lg dwarf galaxies are confined to one of two thin and highly symmetric planes @xcite , it it worthwhile to investigate how the ngc 3109 association relates to these structures .      in the following ,",
    "we use the galaxy positions as compiled by @xcite .",
    "however , like @xcite we use the homogeneous set of tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) distance moduli from @xcite for the members of the ngc 3109 association . for leo p",
    ", we adopt the recent trgb distance modulus by @xcite , according to which the galaxy is at a distance of @xmath65mpc from the sun .",
    "the galaxies in the ngc 3109 association all have similar galactocentric distances of 1.31.4mpc , and leo p is also consistent with this distance range .",
    "the association is therefore oriented approximately perpendicular to our the line - of sight , the angle between the long axis of the association and the line connecting the associations centroid with the position of the mw is @xmath66 .",
    "the galaxies also have very similar distances from m31 and from the center of the lg , such that the association is also oriented approximately perpendicular as seen from those points ( 85 and @xmath67 , respectively ) .",
    "the ngc 3109 association is therefore almost perpendicular from the line connecting its centroid with the position of m31 .",
    "we have determined the associations s orientation in the same cartesian coordinate system used previously by employing the method used in @xcite .",
    "this effectively fits an ellipsoid to the points by determining the eigenvectors of the moments of inertia tensor defined by the non - mass - weighted galaxy positions .",
    "this gives the orientations of the major , intermediate and minor axes and the root - mean - square ( rms ) heights of the distribution along these axes .",
    "the resulting rms axis ratios of the ngc 3109 association are indicative for a very elongated distribution which is extremely flat in one direction ( short - to - long axis ratio @xmath68 ) and a bit more extended along the intermediate axis ( @xmath69 , still narrow compared to the long axis ) , like a ruler .",
    "the long axis points to @xmath70  or @xmath71 , with an uncertainty of @xmath72 .",
    "the association therefore aligns ( being only @xmath73  inclined ) with the supergalactic plane @xcite .",
    "it is also almost parallel to lgp1@xmath5  ( @xmath74  inclined ) , but offset by 0.3 ( leo p ) to 0.5 mpc ( antlia and ngc 3109 ) , as can be seen in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lgplanes ] .",
    "the lg is the closest major galaxy group to the ngc 3109 association and none of the other nearby galaxy groups listed in are well aligned with the line defined by the main axis of the ngc 3109 association . the closest alignment , at an angle of @xmath75 ,",
    "is found for the m 81 group , but at a distance of @xmath76mpc from the association , two times as distant as the lg , this is most likely a chance alignment .    the short axis ( normal direction if it were a plane ) of the ellipsoid describing the ngc 3109 association points to @xmath77  and @xmath78 .",
    "this is extremely close to the pole of the supergalactic plane ( @xmath41 = [ 47^\\circ.4 , 6^\\circ.3]$ ] ) and also similar to the normal to the lgp1@xmath5  pointing to @xmath40 .",
    "intriguingly , the normal to the gpoa has a similar orientation as well ( @xmath41 = [ 206^\\circ , 8^\\circ]$ ] , @xcite ) , even though it is defined by the co - orbiting satellite galaxies of m31 on the opposite side of the mw than the ngc 3109 association .",
    "however , the mw is offset by 0.8mpc and m31 by 0.9mpc from the ngc 3109 association along this short axis direction .",
    "thus , while some hints for a connection exist it is not immediately obvious whether the ngc 3109 association is related to the dwarf galaxy planes in the lg . in the following",
    "we will discuss additional indications why it might be part of the lg and its dwarf galaxy geometry .",
    "@xcite mention several types of possible origins of the alignment of the ngc 3109 association .",
    "these include a tidal encounter with the mw which has stretched a pre - existing group of dwarf galaxies along its orbital plane , the formation of the galaxies as phase - space correlated tdgs , or the formation of the ngc 3109 association in a thin and cold cosmological filament which is just now starting to fall towards the lg . here",
    "we discuss these suggestions in more detail .      assuming the ngc 3109 association to be bound and spherically symmetric , @xcite estimate that it would have to have a mass of @xmath79 .",
    "this is a significant fraction ( up to one third ) of the total mass of @xmath80  currently estimated for the mw halo @xcite .",
    "if the ngc 3109 association were embedded in such a massive dark matter halo , this halo should significantly influence the dynamics of the lg .",
    "in addition , a past interaction with the massive dark matter content of the association would have likely lead to it merging with the mw because dynamical friction must be significant in this mass range . a spherical dark matter halo encompassing the whole association would furthermore have to have a radius of at least 600 kpc , half the associations diameter .",
    "this is twice as much as the virial radii assumed for the mw and m31 and would almost reach leo a at a distance of about 800kpc from the ngc 3109 association .",
    "we therefore deem it unlikely that the ngc 3109 association is a distinct gravitationally bound entity .",
    "@xcite suggest a cosmological accretion scenario in which the ngc 3109 association is a `` thin and cold cosmological filament '' , assuming that the galaxies in the association have recently left the hubble flow and are currently falling into the lg for the very first time . however , simulated dark matter filaments around mw - like haloes today have diameters which are larger than the virial radii of the major haloes they feed @xcite . due to its much more narrow configuration",
    ", the ngc 3109 association can not be identified with such a major dark matter filament .",
    "the dark matter hypothesis does , however , allow the freedom to propose that the ngc 3109 association is embedded in a dark matter `` sub - filament '' , which would have to be oriented almost perpendicular to its closest major mass concentration .",
    "while cosmological simulations might be searched for the existence of thin sub - filaments of this kind , as of now such a suggestion unfortunately remains non - testable via observations .",
    "however , one wonders how such a dark matter filament in the vicinity of the major dark matter halo potentials of the mw and m31 could have remained essentially a straight line over a length of 1.2mpc without being aligned towards the mass concentration .",
    "the interpretation that the association is a filament falling towards the lg is in conflict with the orientation of the ngc 3109 association being almost perpendicular to the direction towards the mw or the lg barycenter .",
    "simulated filaments of cold gas , which would be narrow enough to accommodate the thin association , point towards the central galaxy and are considered to be important at high redshifts of @xmath81  only ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more importantly , the ngc 3109 association does not fall towards but recedes from the mw with @xmath82 , a velocity similar to those of galaxies at larger distances of 1.6 to 2.2 mpc ( see e.g. fig .",
    "5 of @xcite ) .",
    "the association appears to be situated beyond the zero - velocity surface of the lg ( @xmath83  1 to 1.5mpc ) and therefore should follow the hubble flow .",
    "if it follows the hubble flow , the galaxies should never have been close to the lg ( except during the big bang ) .",
    "however , the members of the ngc 3109 association appear to recede faster than the expected hubble flow velocity at their distance ( see e.g. figure 6 of @xcite ) .",
    "if this is the case and if they are on radial orbits ( otherwise their motion is even faster ) , the galaxies must have been close to the mw in the past .",
    "assuming that all galaxies in the ngc 3109 association are receding on radial orbits from the mw ( i.e. the tangential velocity is zero ) , and that they have been travelling with their current galactocentric velocity ( no acceleration ) gives a rough estimate for their travel time .",
    "if we transform the measured heliocentric velocities to galactocentric ones by assuming a circular velocity of the local standard of rest ( lsr ) of 220 km / s and a peculiar motion of the sun as measured by @xcite , the travel times are @xmath84gyr for ngc 3109 , @xmath85 gyr for sextans b , @xmath86gyr for antlia and @xmath87gyr for sextans a. due to the large distance uncertainty for leo p its travel time is in the range of 7.6 to 10.6 gyr .",
    "the stated uncertainties are based on the distance uncertainties and an assumed uncertainty in the line - of - sight velocities of the galaxies of 2 kms@xmath88 .",
    "of course , the major inaccuracy comes from the over - simplified assumption of radial orbits without acceleration .",
    "another major source of uncertainty is the lsr velocity .",
    "if we assume a lsr velocity of 240 kms@xmath88 , instead of the previously used 220 kms@xmath88 , the travel times become 0.75 gyr longer on average .",
    "if the galaxies in the ngc 3109 association do not have a significant tangential velocity , this timing estimate demonstrates that they have been close to the mw in the past .",
    "more importantly , the galaxies are consistent with all having been nearby at about the same time , @xmath89gyr ago . only ngc",
    "3109 s timing appears to be off by 1.52 gyr , but unaccounted - for tangential motion , gravitational acceleration by the lg galaxies and others and the possible interaction between members of the ngc 3109 association make this estimate unreliable on such time scales .    that the ngc 3109 members have been close to the mw at a similar time in the past is also consistent with results by @xcite . in their model of the dynamical history of the lg ,",
    "the ngc 3109 association members had a close passage ( pericenter @xmath90kpc ) with the mw about 7gyr ago .",
    "however , at such a distance dynamical friction , in particular for massive objects such as ngc 3109 or the putative dark matter halo needed if one requires that the association as a whole is gravitationally bound , can not be neglected .",
    "as @xcite do not consider dynamical friction in their study , the orbit of the association s members as derived from their study becomes unreliable as soon as they come close to the mw halo .",
    "another independent indication that the members of the ngc 3109 association have been close to the lg before is their identification as probable backsplash galaxies , galaxies which have passed through the virial volume of the mw in the past but are now situated outside of it . by comparing the distances and line - of - sight velocities of lg galaxies with sub - haloes in the via lactea ii simulation , @xcite identify all four of the then - known galaxies in the ngc 3109 association as likely backsplash haloes that have interacted with the mw before .",
    "it therefore appears likely that the ngc 3109 association had a past encounter with the mw , in conflict with the interpretation as an infalling dark matter filament .",
    "a scenario in which a pre - existing group of dwarf galaxies collided with the mw and was tidally stretched along its orbit appears plausible , but the effects of dynamical friction in such a scenario will need to be assessed .",
    "it is currently not possible to discriminate such a scenario from one in which the galaxies were formed as tdgs in a past encounter in the lg , but there are additional coincidences which make a tdg origin look more appealing .      as shown before , given their current distances and line - of - sight velocities , the galaxies in the ngc 3109 association are consistent with having been in the vicinity of the mw at roughly the same time about 7 to 9 gyr ago .",
    "this leads us to the other possible origin of the association discussed by @xcite : the galaxies might have been expelled as tdgs in a galaxy encounter .",
    "interestingly , the estimated travel times are in good agreement with independent estimates for the timing of major galaxy encounters suggested as the origin of a population of tdgs in the lg :    * based on the ages of the young halo globular clusters , the vpos around the mw was estimated to have formed 912gyr ago @xcite . *",
    "a major merger might have formed m31 89gyr ago .",
    "this event must have produced tdgs , some of which would constitute the gpoa today while others would have been expelled towards the mw , maybe forming the vpos @xcite . * in mond",
    "the observed baryonic masses of the mw and m31 and their relative velocity require a past encounter between the two major galaxies to have happened 711gyr ago .",
    "the ngc 3109 association is therefore consistent with having formed in the same major galaxy encounter and thus such an origin can not be ruled out at present .",
    "the sfhs of the non - satellite galaxies do not provide conclusive information either , because most non - satellite galaxies in the lg are dirrs which show ongoing star formation , consistent with expectations for gas - rich tdgs if the present high - resolution simulations of tdg formation and early evolution can be extrapolated to many gyr .",
    "differing environmental effects will furthermore diversify the evolutionary histories of tdgs born in the same event over time .",
    "the apparent dark matter content of some of these galaxies , unexpected for tdgs in a cold dark matter universe , is not a conclusive argument against the possible tdg nature of the ngc 3109 association either , as inflated velocity dispersions are expected in mond as exemplified in sect .",
    "[ sect : mond ] .    to be consistent with a scenario in which a major fraction of the lg galaxies was formed in one common major encounter",
    ", the members of the ngc 3109 association must show signs of being related to the other dwarf galaxy structures known in the lg , in particular the vpos , the gpoa and potentially the lg dwarf galaxy planes , because tdgs form as a phase - space correlated population , i.e. in a highly flattened tidal tail .",
    "if the ngc 3109 association shows alignments with other lg dwarf galaxies , this might indicate that the ngc 3109 association is , contrary to current belief , not an isolated entity and might share a common origin with other dwarf galaxy structures .",
    "given that the total extent of the ngc 3109 association ( the distance between leo p and antlia ) is 1.2 mpc , while the three lgp1 members ugc 4879 , leo a and leo t are at distances of only 0.81 mpc from their respectively closest member of the ngc 3109 association , these eight galaxies might well constitute one common structure of square - megaparsec size .",
    "the difference in the galactocentric line - of - sight velocities between the ngc 3109 association ( receding ) and the other three galaxies ( slowly approaching ) might then be simply due to the stronger gravitational attraction acting on the more nearby galaxies .",
    "indeed , as seen from the center of the lg the members of the ngc 3109 association align along a similar band as defined by ugc 4879 , leo a and leo t ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : asp ] ) .",
    "this indicates that they are in a common plane running through the center of the lg .",

    "there is no other known dwarf galaxy in the northern hemisphere of the mw and between galactocentric distances of 0.3 to 1.7 mpc from the mw , such that all currently known nearby non - satellite dwarf galaxies to the north of the mw are confined to this one common plane .    to determine how significant this planar alignment is , we follow the same principle as in sect .",
    "[ sect : perseus ] ( thus the same caveats apply here ) .",

    "the first method draws the galaxy positions randomly from an isotropic distribution , but we force the galaxies to be confined to @xmath97 .",

    "this method conserves the distances from the mw , but not from m31 . in this case",

    "again they are required to be at @xmath97 . in this case only seven ( 0.007 per cent ) of the realisations result in sufficiently thin best - fit planes .",
    "however , antlia might be interpreted as a satellite of ngc 3109 @xcite , such that these two galaxies might not be treated as two independent systems . if we exclude antlia from this analysis ( thus using only seven instead of eight galaxies ) , the probabilities to find a plane at least as narrow as the observed one increase to 0.079 per cent if the galaxy positions are chosen from an isotropic distribution and to 0.037 per cent if the galaxy positions are individually rotated by a random angle around the mw ",
    "a plane as narrow as the observed great northern plane is therefore very unlikely to occur by pure chance .",

    "according to @xcite , overall only 13 per cent of all sub - haloes between 300 and 1500kpc from the mw should be backsplash haloes .",
    "this can be expressed in another way , which might highlight a more curious coincidence : all galaxies in the great northern plane except for ugc 4879 are possible backsplash objects , posing the question why they should all be in the same thin , planar structure . even more puzzling",
    "is that most of the remaining five likely backsplash galaxies of @xcite situated in the southern hemisphere of the mw are also close to the great northern plane defined by the northern non - satellite galaxies only : ngc 185 at a distance of 45kpc from the best - fit plane , phoenix at 87kpc , whereas more recent measurements yield @xmath106kms@xmath88  @xcite or even @xmath107kms@xmath88 @xcite .",

    "might be more than a lucky coincidence .",
    "the study by @xcite , according to which the distance and the line - of - sight velocity makes five out of seven of these galaxies more consistent with being backsplash galaxies than infalling ones , whereas the latter type should be seven times more abundant , might indicate another small - scale problem for the current @xmath1cdm cosmology .",
    "to find at least 5 out of 7 galaxies to be backsplash objects if only 13 per cent of all galaxies in this distance range should be backsplash objects has a likelihood of only 0.12 per cent .",
    "even if half of the candidates are false positives , i.e. we would expect to find that 26 per cent of all galaxies are identified as candidates , the chance to draw 5 out of 7 candidates is still only 3 per cent . if leo p is included as a backsplash object , these likeliehoods drop even more . unless cosmological simulations can show that there is a large excess of backsplash haloes in one hemisphere from a central galaxy , the @xmath1cdm model will face an `` overabundant backsplash problem '' in the lg .",
    "already now we have to wonder how , in a whole hemisphere , there can be more galaxies which have been close to the mw before and escaped to large distances than there are galaxies which are falling in , unless at least some of them have formed in and been expelled from the lg as tdgs .",
    "in addition , if the identification as backsplash galaxies by @xcite is confirmed by other studies , we might even face a `` planar backsplash problem '' as almost all of the current backsplash candidates lie within about 100 kpc of the same plane , which is defined by only the northern non - satellite galaxies and measures more than 1mpc in diameter .",
    "again , this might be well understood in a tdg scenario where new galaxies form in a tidal tail as a phase - space correlated population , but there is no reason to anticipate a planar configuration among backsplash galaxies .    as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : backsplashdebris ] , tdgs expelled from a major galaxy encounter will have similar orbital properties as backsplash - sub - haloes .",

    "we have predicted perseus i s velocity dispersion to be @xmath120 .",
    "the corresponding prediction for cetus ( @xmath121 ) is in much better agreement with the more recent observational value ( @xmath122 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than with the previous measurement ( @xmath123 : * ? ? ?",
    "the prediction for tucana ( @xmath124 ) is in conflict with the available measurement .",

    "the orientation of the ngc 3109 association consisting of the dwarf galaxies ngc 3109 , antlia , sextans a , sextans b and leo p has been determined in the same coordinate system used to review the planes of co - orbiting satellite galaxies around the mw and m31 and the symmetric larger - scale dwarf galaxy structure in the lg @xcite . the association aligns with the supergalactic plane , is almost perpendicular to our line - of - sight and parallel but offset by 300 - 500kpc to lgp1@xmath5 .",
    "4 .   the members of the ngc 3109 association have large receding velocities which indicate that they have been close to the mw in the past , possibly at the same time about 79gyr ago .",
    "this is consistent with their orbits passing within @xmath90kpc of the mw suggested by @xcite and the identification as likely backsplash galaxies by @xcite .",
    "together with the association s extremely narrow extent and perpendicular orientation this argues against the association tracing a thin and cold cosmological filament .",
    "the timing is consistent with independent timing estimates for several suggested major galaxy encounter scenarios in the lg , during which phase - space correlated populations of tdgs could have formed that would today give rise to the observed dwarf galaxy structures .",
    "the association aligns with the other three distant ( @xmath125kpc ) lg galaxies in the northern hemisphere of the mw in a narrow plane ( rms height of @xmath126kpc and axis ratios of @xmath127  and @xmath128 ) .",
    "this `` great northern plane '' passes through the center of the lg , is inclined to lgp1@xmath5  by only @xmath6 and to the gpoa by @xmath101 and is consistent with being aligned with the preferred orbital plane of the mw satellites in the vpos .",
    "five out of seven ( 6 of 8 if the later discovered leo p would be included ) of the galaxies in the great northern plane have been identified as likely backsplash objects by @xcite , and most of the remaining five backsplash candidates in the southern galactic hemisphere are also situated close to the same plane . as only a small fraction of sub - haloes in simulations",
    "are identified as backsplash objects the finding of a majority of such galaxies in one hemisphere is extremely unlikely ( @xmath2  per cent ) and might constitute an `` overabundant backsplash problem '' for @xmath1cdm .",
    "it would mean that more galaxies are receding in one direction from the mw than are being accreted onto the mw from that direction . a natural explanation for this would be the local formation of galaxies as tdgs , which , if expelled to large distances , have very similar orbital properties like cosmological backsplash galaxies .",
    "that the backsplash candidates preferentially lie in a common plane is also consistent with an interpretation as phase - space correlated tdgs .",
    "lg galaxies are found to be preferentially infalling in the galactic south and receding in the galactic north , which possibly indicates that the mw is moving through a stream of dwarf galaxies .",
    "this would be in qualitative agreement with the m31-merger scenario by @xcite , in which our galaxy passes through the tidal debris expelled in a past merger forming m31 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the tdg origin would be in m31 , such that the galaxies move away from m31 sufficiently fast which would imply that they have a tangential velocity component relative to the mw , rendering the timing estimate of sect .",
    "[ sect : timing ] somewhat useless .",
    "the scenario should however be testable on lg scales if proper motion measurements of the distant dwarf galaxies could be obtained .",
