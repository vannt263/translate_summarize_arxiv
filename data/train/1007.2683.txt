    "however working in the ( completed ) free associative algebra over @xmath17 on two variables one finds that if @xmath24 and @xmath25 do nt commute , then one has the fundamental baker - campbell - hausdorff identity : @xmath27 + \\frac{1}{12}[x,[x , y ] ] - \\frac{1}{12}[y,[x , y ] ] + \\dots } = e^{x+y+i}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is an infinite sum of iterated brackets of @xmath24 and @xmath25 with rational coefficients and where @xmath29=ab - ba$ ] . due to this ,",
    "whenever @xmath30 , we can associate a formal group @xmath31 to every @xmath11-lie algebra @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath32 and the usual euclidean metric is used , the defining series converge and one recovers the classical `` exponential - log '' correspondence between lie algebras and lie groups .    over the @xmath0-adic integers",
    "@xmath18 with the @xmath0-adic metric , and @xmath0 an odd prime , @xmath33 can be shown to converge for every @xmath34 . thus if we let @xmath35 be the lie algebra of @xmath36 , @xmath0-adic matrices with the bracket @xmath37 = \\mathbb{a}\\mathbb{b}-\\mathbb{b}\\mathbb{a}$ ] , one has that @xmath38 is a group .",
    "in fact since @xmath39 , it is not hard to show that @xmath38 is the group of @xmath0-adic matrices which are congruent to the identity matrix mod @xmath0 , which is called the @xmath0-congruence subgroup @xmath40 of @xmath41 .",
    "( see exponential - log correspondence in @xcite ) . from this formal group",
    ", one can form a tower of finite @xmath0-groups @xmath42 mod @xmath43 for @xmath44 for which @xmath38 is the inverse limit .",
    "it is not hard to see that @xmath45 is elementary abelian and can be identified naturally with the residue lie algebra of the @xmath0-adic lie algebra @xmath2 i.e. , @xmath46 .",
    "in fact @xmath47",
    "so @xmath48 corresponds to @xmath49 .",
    "a little more analysis shows that we have a central short exact sequence @xmath50 and so @xmath51 is a @xmath0-group given by a central extension of an elementary abelian @xmath0-group by itself .",
    "more generally , for @xmath0 odd , one can show given any @xmath52-lie algebra @xmath53 ( whether it lifts to the @xmath0-adics or not ) there exists a unique @xmath0-power exact sequence @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a @xmath0-group of order @xmath56 .",
    "in fact the construction @xmath57 is part of a covariant functor from the category of @xmath52-lie algebras to the category of @xmath0-groups .",

    "quadratic forms arise and the correspondence needs to be modified ( see @xcite and @xcite ) . due to this , throughout this paper , @xmath0 denotes an odd prime .    in @xcite it was shown that if @xmath59 is the dimension of @xmath53 , then @xmath60\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the dual of @xmath53 . here @xmath62 denotes the exterior algebra on the vector space @xmath63 where @xmath63 is given grading 1 while @xmath64 $ ] denotes the polynomial algebra on @xmath63 where @xmath63 is given grading 2 .",
    "furthermore the differential provided by the bockstein @xmath65 was shown to be the same as the differential that makes this algebra into the koszul resolution computing @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the dual adjoint representation of @xmath53 on @xmath61 and the action of @xmath53 is extended to @xmath68 by declaring it to act via derivations .",
    "thus the @xmath65-cohomology of these @xmath0-groups was shown to be @xmath66 and this is interesting as this cohomology gives the 2nd page of the bockstein spectral sequence used to analyze the integral cohomology @xmath69 .",
    "explicitly if we decompose the polynomial algebra @xmath68 into its homogeneous components ( hodge decomposition ) @xmath70 we have @xmath71 and so the higher torsion in the integral cohomology of the @xmath0-group @xmath55 is reflected in these lie algebra cohomology groups .",
    "in fact an analysis of the integral cohomology of @xmath72 using these techniques was used to provide a counterexample in @xcite to a conjecture of adem ( see @xcite ) at odd primes .    in this paper , we study a fundamental differential graded algebra ( dga ) associated to any lie algebra @xmath53 given by the koszul resolution whose underlying algebra is @xmath73 with a differential such that the cohomology calculates @xmath66 . while our motivation is to calculate higher torsion in the integral cohomology of @xmath0-groups and hence primarily concerns lie algebras over @xmath52 , our basic technique is to relate these lie algebras to lie algebras defined over @xmath4 and to then compare these to the corresponding lie algebras defined over @xmath17 or @xmath5 where classical results can be appealed to .",
    "this translates then to results which hold for `` all but finitely many primes '' when studying the corresponding @xmath0-groups .",
    "this philosophy was motivated by previous work with a. adem in @xcite , though the implementation is quite different here .",

    "interestingly enough , this seemingly specialized dga carries a lot of structure . over fields of characteristic zero and for nondegenerate lie algebras ( killing form nondegenerate ) , one has an isomorphism of @xmath53-modules between @xmath76 and @xmath67 . furthermore using the poincare - birkoff - witt theorem",
    "one can identify @xmath77 with @xmath78 as filtered modules and @xmath68 with @xmath79 as graded modules where @xmath78 is the universal enveloping algebra of @xmath53 equipped with the * adjoint * action .",
    "( throughout this paper @xmath78 and its dual will always be equipped with the adjoint action and not the left or right translation action ! ) thus @xmath74 $ ] as a dga is nothing other than the canonical koszul complex computing @xmath80 . in this context",
    "it is important to point out that over fields of characteristic zero , @xmath80 can be identified with the cohomology of the free loop space of @xmath81 in the case that @xmath9 is a compact , connected lie group with lie algebra a real form for @xmath53 as we will see in this paper in the case that @xmath9 is semisimple as a byproduct of our analysis of this spectral sequence .",
    "the cohomology of the free loop space @xmath82 on a manifold @xmath83 has been an object of intense study in the last decade due to the existence of a `` string multiplication '' introduced by chas and sullivan ( see @xcite ) and the structure of a batalin - vilkovisky algebra with string theoretic interpretations , ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore @xmath84 consists of the central elements of @xmath78 , the so called `` casimir ring '' which is very important in the representation theory of @xmath53 .",
    "we will see that their dual elements , the `` dual casimirs '' in @xmath85 play an important role in the higher torsion of @xmath0-groups .    as one of the main tools of this paper ,",
    "we construct a spectral sequence whose @xmath86 term is this dga and whose @xmath87 term is the cohomology of a point which gives a lot of structure to the underlying dga .",
    "though this spectral sequence is defined over any coefficient @xmath11 , over @xmath52 it models the associated bockstein spectral sequence of the corresponding @xmath0-group mentioned above .",
    "more precisely we show that the @xmath88 term of this spectral sequence is identical to the @xmath89 term of the bockstein spectral sequence of the @xmath0-group @xmath55 .",
    "though both spectral sequences converge to the cohomology of a point , it is unknown if the higher pages coincide .",
    "nevertheless , using the structure theorems available for both spectral sequences , and that the first one can be used to compare the situation for the @xmath52-lie algebra with that of corresponding integral and complex lie algebras , one can obtain results . throughout this paper @xmath90",
    "will always refer to the algebraic spectral sequence constructed in the appendix and @xmath91 will denote the bockstein spectral sequence of the group @xmath55 in the case that @xmath53 is a @xmath52-lie algebra .    the spectral sequence @xmath92 carries a lot of information , indeed even over @xmath5 it can be used to recover harish - chandra s calculation of the casimir ring of @xmath93 among many other results .",

    "when @xmath122 , we can define the highest dimension of an element in the finite graded group @xmath123 as the `` exceptional dimension '' of @xmath9 .",

    "moreover by the calculations above , for any @xmath111 , for all but a finite number of primes @xmath0 , the exceptional dimension of @xmath72 is bigger than @xmath111 .",
    "thus for every odd prime there are exceptional elements of order @xmath126 in the reduced integral cohomology of @xmath72 , but there is no bound on the exceptional dimension that holds for all primes .",
    "thus by suitable choice of primes @xmath0 , one can find elements of order @xmath126 in as high a dimension as one likes .",

    "+ ( 2 ) since each piece in the hodge decomposition of the dga of the corresponding integral lie algebra is of finite type , when looking at a chunk corresponding to terms with hodge degree @xmath111 or less , one can use the universal coefficient theorems to say that for all but a finite number of primes , the corresponding dga over @xmath52 will look similar to the one over @xmath5 . +",
    "( 3 ) in every case though there is a breakdown in the dga over @xmath52 when the hodge degree becomes close to @xmath128 and there is generally a phase transition between characteristic zero behaviour and characteristic @xmath0 behaviour .",
    "+ ( 4 ) in many cases we find that the `` exceptional torsion '' is created by the part which corresponds to the characteristic zero case and the transition to characteristic @xmath0 kills this exceptional torsion and is signaled by a divided power issue in the dga for the integral lie algebra .",
    "for example for @xmath129 we prove the key identity @xmath130 in the @xmath52-dga as the left hand side of the identity is @xmath0 times a generator in the corresponding @xmath4-dga .",
    "detailed pictures of the algebraic ss are available in the paper to show how this identity helps cause a `` phase - transition '' between the char 0 and char @xmath0 behaviour in the case of @xmath129 .    in the paper , all semisimple lie algebras are studied , including @xmath131 for @xmath132 , and the exceptional lie algebra @xmath133 .",

    "in addition we show that if @xmath151 is a field of characteristic zero then the @xmath153-page and beyond only has contributions from the weight @xmath154 term while for a field of characteristic @xmath0 , the `` polynomial line '' @xmath155 has contributions only from weights which are zero modulo @xmath0 .    in sections  [ section : derham ] and [ section : modp ] , using a derham complex and d - module language together with the weight stratification mentioned above , explicit mod @xmath0 calculations are performed for the spectral sequence @xmath156 $ ] and the `` almost all '' caveat is removed in a range of hodge degrees :    ( @xmath102-computation ) @xmath157= h^*(\\mathfrak{sl}_2(\\mathbb{f}_p ) , poly(ad^ * ) ) \\sim \\lambda^*(u ) \\otimes \\mathbb{f}_p[\\kappa]\\ ] ] where @xmath109 indicates isomorphism for * all odd primes * in the range of hodge degrees strictly less than @xmath128 .",
