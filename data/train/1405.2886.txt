    "the folding mechanisms of water - soluble proteins from primary to secondary and higher - order structures has been thoroughly investigated over many years . in the study of protein translocation pathways into and across cell membranes , which is a very important active area of current research ,",
    "one important problem requiring further elucidation is the coil - helix transition that accompanies the insertion of a polypeptide into a lipid bilayer .",
    "the theoretical modeling of this ubiquitous process in biological matter is fairly complex due to the heterogeneous environment in which conformational changes occur and the simultaneity or rapid succession of conformational change and translocation .",
    "experimental studies are limited to the small selection of polypeptides that are water soluble and undergo controllable insertion / folding and exit / unfolding processes .",
    "the folding of all helical membrane proteins / peptides , independent of the insertion mechanism , is governed by the formation of helical segments in the lipid bilayer environment .",
    "this process is driven by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding @xcite .",
    "its two main steps are the transformation from coil to interfacial helix and the insertion of the helix into the membrane with transmembrane orientation",
    ". variants of the _ ph low insertion peptide _ ( phlip ) family are water soluble and prove to be well suited for the investigation of membrane - associated folding and unfolding @xcite , reversibly driven by changes in ph . a drop in ph leads to the protonation of negatively charged side chains , which enhances the hydrophobicity of the peptide and initiates the aforementioned two - step process of folding and insertion .",
    "a subsequent rise in ph reverses the process : the peptide unfolds and exits .",
    "recent experimental studies have already established important thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of the peptide - membrane interaction @xcite .",
    "what has been lacking for these and related experiments is a microscopic statistical mechanical model with experimentally testable attributes that is amenable to an exact analysis .",
    "our goal is to construct , solve , develop , and test such a model in three successive stages . the first stage , which is theme of this paper , involves the design and solution of a microscopic model that describes the coil - helix transformation of a long polypeptide adsorbed to the lipid bilayer of a membrane membrane ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : wat - lip - pep ] ) .",
    "such a model is an indispensable part of a theory of membrane - associated folding and will be used as the foundation for the next two stages .",
    "they include ( a ) the investigation of profiles of local attributes for generic polypeptides and landscapes of global attributes for short peptides such as phlip in the heterogeneous water / lipid environment and ( b ) the kinetics of insertion and exit as can be inferred from the landscapes of free energy and conformational attributes .",
    "the pioneering theoretical studies of coil - helix transformations and related phenomena that appeared throughout 1960s were admirably compiled and reviewed in a monograph by poland and scheraga @xcite .",
    "a series of model systems were introduced at that time .",
    "many of them are still being used today in textbooks and research papers .",
    "this includes the familiar zimm - bragg model @xcite and generalizations thereof , all amenable to the transfer matrix method of analysis . also emerging at that time was the highly original lifson method of statistical mechanical analysis @xcite , the scope of which includes ( smooth ) crossovers and ( sharp ) transitions @xcite . the need at this time for yet another model solved by yet a different method is dictated by the three stages of our project as will become apparent in what follows .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : micmod ] we present the microscopic model of our design as a system of statistically interacting links and describe the method of its exact analysis .",
    "depending on the parameter settings the exact solution produces a conformational change in the form of a crossover or a transition ( sec .",
    "[ sec : strusol ] ) .",
    "the transition may be of first or second order as we discuss in sec .",

    "[ sec : con - out ] we summarize the main advances of this work and point out their role as the foundation for the continuation of this project in two different directions in the arenas of biological physics and statistical mechanics .",
    "we also discuss how this work connects to recent studies by other researchers and how the continuation of this project can benefit from those studies .",
    "the microscopic model that we present here is a system of statistically interacting quasiparticles with shapes .",
    "the methodology employed for its exact statistical mechanical analysis is built on the concept of fractional statistics , invented by haldane @xcite , and developed by wu @xcite , isakov @xcite , anghel @xcite , and others @xcite in the context of quantum many - body systems .",
    "the adaptation of this approach to classical statistical mechanical systems of particles with shapes was developed in a recent series of studies with applications to ising spins @xcite , jammed granular matter @xcite , lattice gases with long - range interactions @xcite , and dna under tension @xcite .",
    "the application to the coil - helix transition of a long polypeptide adsorbed to a water - lipid interface worked out in the following is conceptually simple but surprisingly rich in scope .",
    "the reference state ( pseudo - vacuum ) of our model system is the ordered helix conformation of @xmath1 residues bound by peptide bonds into @xmath2 links and stabilized by internal hydrogen bonds along the backbone .",
    "thermal fluctuations or environmental change cause the nucleation of disordered coil segments , which then grow by unravelling adjacent helical order .    in our model the coil segments are represented by thermally activated links that combine to form a self - avoiding random walk between the ends of successive helical segments .",
    "both coil and helix segments are confined to the water - lipid interface ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wat - lip - pep ] ) .",
    "coil segments carry configurational entropy that grows with their size and range in the interfacial plane . that range is controllable at a microscopic level by the integer - valued model parameter @xmath3 , henceforth called range parameter .",
    "each residue can be in @xmath4 states , of which one ( denoted ) represents the helix conformation and @xmath3 ( numbered , ",

[ fig : links ] ) in the plane of the water - lipid interface .",
    "coil links are more extended and directed either horizontally ( ) or vertically ( ) .",
    "our model allows each coil segment to randomly explore the interface on one side of the helical direction without intersecting itself .",
    "that space is discretized and constrained by the length of the segment and by the number of distinct coil states .",
    "we assign different activation energies to coil links relative to links depending on whether they contribute to nucleation or to growth . to the former we assign the activation energy @xmath7 and to the latter @xmath8 ( two model parameters ) .",
    "nucleation of one coil link requires the simultaneous break - up of several internal hydrogen bonds whereas growth proceeds by the break - up of one bond per link ( two bonds shared by different pairs of residues ) . on our way to calculating a partition function",
    "we now face the task of counting microstates of given link content .      for the combinatorial analysis we introduce a set of statistically interacting quasiparticles that contain individual links or pairs of links .",
