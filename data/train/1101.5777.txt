    "nongaussianity ( ng ) is a resource for the implementation of continuous variable quantum information in bosonic systems @xcite .",
    "several schemes to generate nongaussian states from gaussian ones have been proposed , either based on nonlinear interactions or on conditional measurements @xcite . in many cases",
    "the effective nonlinearity is small , and so it is the resulting ng .",
    "it is thus of interest to investigate the ng of states in the neighbourhood of a gaussian state , i.e. the ng of slightly perturbed gaussian states . besides the fundamental interest @xcite this also provides a way to assess different degaussification mechanisms , as well as ng itself as a resource for quantum estimation .",
    "indeed , in an estimation problem where the variation of a parameter affects the gaussian character of the involved states one may expect the amount of ng to play a role in determining the estimation precision .    quantum estimation deals with situations where one tries to infer the value of a parameter @xmath0 by measuring a different quantity @xmath1 , which is somehow related to @xmath0 .",
    "this often happens in quantum mechanics and quantum information where many quantities of interest , e.g. entanglement @xcite , do not correspond to a proper observable and should be estimated from the measurement of one or more observable quantities @xcite .",
    "given a set @xmath2 of quantum states parametrized by the value of the quantity of interest , an estimator @xmath3 for @xmath0 is a real function of the outcomes of the measurements performed on @xmath4 .",
    "the quantum cramer - rao theorem @xcite establishes a lower bound for the variance @xmath5 of any unbiased estimator , i.e. for the estimation precision , @xmath6 in terms of the number of measurements @xmath7 and the so - called quantum fisher information ( qfi ) , which captures the statistical distinguishability of the states within the set .",
    "indeed , the qfi distance itself is proportional to the bures distance @xmath8 $ ] , @xmath9 $ ] being the fidelity , between states corresponding to infinitesimally close values of the parameter , i.e. , in terms of metrics , @xmath10 where @xmath11 , and we have used the eigenbasis @xmath12 gaussian states and a measure of non gaussianity ------------------------------------------------    let us consider a single - mode bosonic system described by the mode operator @xmath13 with commutation relations @xmath14=1 $ ] .",

    "a quantum state is said to be gaussian if its characteristic function has a gaussian form .",
    "once the cm and the vectors of mean values are given , a gaussian state is fully determined .",
    "the amount of ng @xmath28 $ ] of a quantum state @xmath15 may be quantified by the quantum relative entropy @xcite @xmath29 $ ] between @xmath15 and its reference gaussian state @xmath30 , which is a gaussian state with the same covariance matrix @xmath31 as @xmath15 . as for its classical counterpart , the kullback - leibler divergence",

    "the first term is the fisher information of the probability distribution @xmath59 , which coincides with the classical part of the bures distance in the hilbert space .",

    "when traveling on surfaces at constant energy the amount of ng coincides with a proper distance in the hilbert space and , in this case , it has a geometrical interpretation as the infinitesimal bures distance . at the same time , since bures distance is proportional to the qfi one , it expresses the statistical distinguishability of states , and we conclude that moving out from a gaussian state towards its nongaussian neighbours is a resource for estimation purposes .",
    "similar conclusions can be made when comparing families of perturbations @xmath60 corresponding to the same infinitesimal change of energy @xmath61 : in this case the different amounts of ng induced by the perturbations are quantified by the bures distance minus a constant term depending on @xmath61 and the initial thermal energy @xmath62 , i.e. the intial purity @xmath63 = \\hbox{tr}[\\tau^2]= ( 2 n_\\nu + 1)^{-1}$ ] we summarize the above statements in the following    if @xmath64 is a gaussian state and an infinitesimal variation of the value of @xmath0 drives it into a state @xmath65 with the same eigenvectors , then the qfi distance is equal to the ng @xmath66 $ ] plus a term depending both on the infinitesimal variation of energy @xmath61 and on the initial purity @xmath67 +   \\frac{2\\ ,",

    "again we exploit invariance of @xmath28 $ ] under symplectic operations and focus attention to the diagonal state @xmath75 which has the same ng of @xmath15 .",
    "this is the generalization to a finite perturbation of the analysis reported in the previous section , and it is intended as a mean to find the maximally nongaussian state obtainable starting from a given gaussian .",
    "nongaussianity of this kind of states can be written as @xmath58 = s(\\tau_\\eta ) - s(\\eta )   = h[n_\\eta + 1/2 ] - h[q^{(\\epsilon ) } ]   $ ] , where @xmath76=-\\sum_k q^{(\\epsilon)}_k \\log q^{(\\epsilon)}_k$ ] denotes the shannon entropy of the distribution @xmath77 and @xmath78= ( 1-\\epsilon ) n_t + \\epsilon\\ , n_\\mu$ ] is the average number of quanta of @xmath56 .",
    "notice that for a thermal state with @xmath79 quanta we have @xmath80 = h[n_t + 1/2]$ ] . by using the concavity of the shannon entropy",
    "we obtain an upper bound for the ng",
    "@xmath81 \\leq h[n_\\eta + 1/2 ] - h[n_t + 1/2 ] + \\epsilon \\big ( h[n_t + 1/2 ] - h[\\mu ] \\big)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in particular , if the two distributions have the same number of quanta , @xmath82 , and thus @xmath83 , the bound on @xmath58 $ ] only depends on the difference between the entropy of the initial and target distributions .",
    "let us now consider perturbations towards some relevant distributions i.e. poissonian @xmath84 , thermal @xmath85 , and fock @xmath86 and evaluate the ng of states obtained as convex combination of a thermal state with @xmath79 quanta and a diagonal quantum state with a poissonian , thermal or fock distributions and @xmath87 quanta .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ f:1n ] we plot the ng of the convex combination @xmath15 as a function of @xmath87 for different values of @xmath88 : if we consider the convex combination with a fock state , the ng simply increases monotonically with the energy of the added state . for combinations with poissonian and thermal distributions",
    "we have a maximum for @xmath89 , then a local minimum ( which for the thermal distribution corresponds trivially to @xmath28=0 $ ] ) for @xmath82 , and then the nong increases again for higher values of @xmath90 .",
    "this implies that in order to increase ng the best thing to do is to perturb the initial gaussian either with a highly excited state @xmath91 or with the vacuum state @xmath92 . if we choose @xmath93 we know from eq .",
    "( [ eq : nongbures ] ) that ng for small perturbations is equivalent to the bures infinitesimal distance between the two probability distributions @xmath94 and @xmath95 . in fig .",
    "[ f:1n]d we show the ng as a function of @xmath88 : as it is apparent from the plot the ng obtained by adding a fock state is always much larger that the one for a poissonian profile .",
    "we observe that in the latter case the expansion at the second order obtained in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nongexp ] ) is still accurate for values of @xmath88 approaching @xmath96 , while it fails to be accurate for @xmath97 for a fock state , becoming an upper bound on the exact amount of ng .",
    "we have also investigated what happens by considering a target distribution randomly chosen on a finite subspace of the infinite hilbert space : again we have obtained that , at fixed energy of the target state , perturbing with a fock state yields the biggest increase of ng .",
    "this may be easily generalized to a system of @xmath98 bosonic modes , where the most general gaussian state is described by @xmath99 independent parameters .",
    "gaussian states are known to be extremal state at fixed covariance matrix for several relevant quantities , e.g. channel capacities and entanglement measures @xcite .",
    "therefore , one may wonder whether perturbing a gaussian state at fixed covariance matrix may be quantified in convenient way for the purposes of quantum estimation .",
    "this indeed the case : the ng provides an upper bound to the qfi distance at fixed covariance matrix and thus have an operational interpretation in terms of statistical distinguishability . this is more precisely expressed by the following theorem @xcite    if @xmath64 is a gaussian state and an infinitesimal variation of the value of @xmath0 drives it into a state @xmath65 with the same covariance matrix , then the ng @xmath66 $ ] provides an upper bound to the qfi distance @xmath100 \\:.\\ ] ]    * proof * : if @xmath65 and @xmath64 have the same cm then the ng of @xmath65 , @xmath66 = \\s(\\varrho_{\\lambda+d\\lambda}||\\tau_\\lambda)=\\widetilde h(\\lambda)d\\lambda^2 $ ] , where the so - called kubo - mori - bogolubov information @xmath101 @xcite provides an upper bound for the quantum fisher information @xmath102 @xcite , thus proving the theorem .",
    "@xmath68 + @xmath103    the above theorem says that a larger ng of the perturbed state may correspond to a greater distinguishability from the original one , thus allowing a more precise estimation . of course",
    ", this is not ensured by the theorem , which only provides an upper bound to the qfi .",
    "one may wonder that when @xmath65 is itself a gaussian state the theorem requires @xmath104 , i.e. no reliable estimation is possible .",
    "indeed , this should be the case , since gaussian states are uniquely determined by the first two moments and thus the requirement that the perturbed @xmath105 and the original state @xmath106 are both gaussian and have the same covariance matrix implies that they are actually the same quantum state .",
    "in conclusion , we have addressed the ng of states obtained by weakly perturbing a gaussian states and have investigated the relationships with quantum estimation .",
    "we found that ng provides a lower bound to the qfi distance for classical perturbations , i.e. perturbations to eigenvalues leaving the eigenvectors unperturbed , and an upper bound for perturbations leaving the covariance matrix unperturbed . for situations where",
    "the cm is changed by the perturbation we have no general results . on the other hand",
    ", it has been already shown that non - gaussian states improve quantum estimation of both unitary perturbations as the displacement and the squeezing parameters @xcite and nonunitary ones as the loss parameter of a dissipative channel @xcite .",
    "overall , our results show that the geometry of nongaussian states in the neighbourhood of a gaussian state is definitely not trivial and can not be subsumed by a differential structure . despite this fact ,",
    "the analysis of perturbations to a gaussian state may help in revealing when , and to which extent , ng is a resource for quantum estimation .",
    "we have also analyzed the ng of specific families of perturbed gaussian states with the aim of finding the maximally non gaussian state obtainable from a given gaussian one .",
