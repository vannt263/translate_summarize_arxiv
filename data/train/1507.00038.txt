    "real - space renormalization group ( rg ) methods have a long and successful history in the study of critical behavior in quantum many - body systems  @xcite .",
    "research into such methods remains very active , as new innovations seek a delicate balance : to be tractable , the exponential size of the state space for large quantum many - body systems requires an extreme truncation of degrees of freedom , yet discarding too much can lead to inaccurate predictions .",
    "real - space rg methods beyond the original blocking approach of kadanoff  @xcite include the density matrix renormalization group  @xcite , projected entangled pair states  @xcite , the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz ( mera )  @xcite , and tensor network renormalization  @xcite , among others .",
    "in contrast to these sophisticated techniques , it has recently been shown that a very simple real - space rg map can be used to accurately predict some of the critical behavior of the quantum transverse - field ising model  @xcite .",
    "rather than requiring intensive numerical calculations , this method can be solved analytically and gives closed - form expressions for rg fixed points and critical exponents .",
    "this simple method exactly predicts the correlation - length critical exponent @xmath0 for the one - dimensional model , and is surprisingly accurate for higher - dimensional models on a variety of lattices  @xcite .",
    "the method is shown to yield accurate results for the potts model as well  @xcite .",
    "it is unclear , however , whether this success is particular to the ising model ( and variants , like the potts model ) or can be applied to a wider range of models and more general studies of criticality .    in this paper , we formalize and generalize this simple real - space rg technique to preserve on - site symmetries under blocking ; we refer to this method as the _ symmetry - respecting real - space renormalization group ( srs rg)_. we then apply the srs rg to the quantum ashkin - teller ( at ) model  @xcite .",
    "this one - dimensional quantum spin lattice model has several properties that make it desirable for an investigation into the general efficacy of the srs rg map .",
    "first , it includes many features of the ising model , such as the on - site symmetry that has been argued to be a key component of the success of this simple technique  @xcite .",
    "in fact , for a particular choice of hamiltonian parameters , the at model reduces to two uncoupled ising models .",
    "the at model has a much richer structure , however .",
    "most notably , it possesses a line of criticality , along which the correlation length critical exponent is expected to vary continuously .",
    "therefore , calculating this critical exponent using the srs rg along this line is a useful test of the method s performance .",
    "we note that the at model along this line of criticality is equivalent to the exactly - solvable six - vertex model  @xcite , and is expected to be described by a conformal field theory ( cft ) with central charge @xmath1 , specifically the so - called _",
    "@xmath1 orbifold boson cft_. we can compare the calculated critical exponents from srs rg with those obtained from the six - vertex model  @xcite as well as the known behavior of the cft .",
    "a recent study of the critical behavior of the at model and a detailed comparison with the @xmath1 orbifold boson cft predictions was performed using mera  @xcite ( a much more sophisticated and numerically - intensive real - space rg method ) , and this provides a useful benchmark .",
    "our analysis shows that this symmetry - respecting real - space rg scheme can quantitatively capture aspects of the critical behaviour for the at model , and performs reasonably compared with more sophisticated numerical methods especially given its simplicity . by focussing on preserving the symmetry at each blocking",
    ", the srs rg captures many of the important features of the rg flow and behavior along the critical line .",
    "although this technique may be of limited use as an accurate numerical simulation method , its simplicity and analytical form may allow this method to play a role analogous to mean - field theory for critical rg flows .    specifically , when applied to the at model , we find that the srs rg identifies fixed points on the critical line .",
    "although the scaling field associated with flow along this line is predicted from the cft to be marginal , we find that the srs rg scheme does not exactly reproduce this marginal behavior and instead yields two rg fixed points on the critical line . nonetheless , the rg flow can be used to calculate the correlation length critical exponent along the entire line of criticality , and gives a simple closed form expression for this exponent that is in broad agreement with the cft behavior .",
    "the calculated exponent is exact at the ising decoupling point ( the point in parameter space where the at model reduces to two uncoupled ising models ) and the relative error in this calculated exponent is comparable to the numerically - intensive mera simulations performed in ref .",
    "specifically , the srs rg gives a relative error in the prediction of @xmath2 in the range @xmath3 $ ] , and much small error for @xmath4 , compared with @xmath5 error in ref .",
    "the accuracy decreases significantly towards the endpoints of the critical line .",
    "while the simplest srs rg is obtained using the smallest blocking size of @xmath6 to @xmath7 , we also explore alternate larger blocking schemes , which yield similar results .",
    "our paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rgtheory ] we introduce the srs rg scheme in terms of a tree tensor network , focussing on the construction of the basic isometry defining the rg map through properties of the hamiltonian and its on - site symmetries . in sec .",
    "[ sec : at ] we apply the srs rg to the quantum ashkin - teller model , constructing this rg map and using it to determine the fixed points and critical behavior of this model along its line of criticality .",
