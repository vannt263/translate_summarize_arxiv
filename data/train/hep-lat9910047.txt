    "the balls in boxes model is a simple statistical model describing an ensemble of balls distributed in boxes subject only to a single global constraint . in some circumstances the model undergoes a phase transition driven by a condensation of the balls into a single box .",
    "the model has been introduced as a mean field approximation to lattice gravity @xcite . despite its simplicity",
    ", the model captures the main features of the phase transition observed in lattice euclidean quantum gravity models ( _ ie _ dynamical triangulations ) such as the discontinuity of the transition @xcite and the appearance of singular structures @xcite .",
    "variations of the phase transition of the balls in boxes type can be found in many areas of physics like the thermodynamics of hadrons or strings @xcite , branched polymers @xcite or percolation .",
    "the balls in boxes model is also closely related to urn models @xcite and the spherical model @xcite .",
    "it is thus a rather generic type of phase transition .",
    "the model has an interesting phase structure  : by tuning a single parameter one can change the order of the transition or make the transition disappear entirely @xcite .",
    "this sort of phase transition was discovered in the spherical model by berlin and kac @xcite .",
    "the nature of the transition is quite different from more standard phase transitions in the theory of critical phenomena which result from the appearance of long range spatial correlations . here",
    "the transition does not refer to any correlations in space .",
    "instead , it is a kinematic condensation which comes about when a fugacity of the series representing the partition function hits the radius of convergence of the series .",
    "this fugacity sticks to the radius of convergence and can not move . at this point",
    "the corresponding physical system enters the condensed phase . from this point of view",
    "the mechanism of the transition is very similar to bose ",
    "einstein condensation .",
    "the basic difference between the balls in boxes type of condensation and the bose - einstein one is that in the latter the system condenses into an energetically favoured ground state , while in the former balls condense into a box which is indistinguishable from the remaining ones .",
    "the balls in box condensation thus spontaneously breaks the permutation symmetry of the boxes .    the thermodynamic limit of the balls in boxes model and the relation to lattice gravity has been discussed in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "here we discuss finite size effects and confront theoretical predictions with the numerical analysis .",
    "the numerical analysis is done using an exact algorithm which recursively generates partition functions for systems of moderate size _",
    "ie _ up to a few thousand boxes .",
    "in this section we briefly recall the model @xcite .",
    "the model describes @xmath0 balls distributed in @xmath1 boxes .",
    "each box has a certain weight @xmath2 which depends only on the number @xmath3 , of balls in it .",
    "the weights @xmath2 are the same for all boxes . for a given partition of balls in boxes @xmath4 ,",
    "the total weight of the configuration is equal to the product @xmath5 ",
    "_ ie _ the boxes are almost independent .",
    "they are not entirely independent because of the constraint @xmath6 .",
    "it is this constraint which makes the model nontrivial .",
    "the model is defined as a sum over all partitions of @xmath0 balls in @xmath1 boxes weighted by the product weight .",
    "this is a fixed density ensemble , with density @xmath7 . in the thermodynamic limit @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , the behaviour of the system depends on the density @xmath10 .",
    "for some choices of weights @xmath2 , there exists a critical value @xmath11 above which the condensation of balls takes place , which means that a box appears in the system which contains a finite fraction of the balls .",
    "the phase transition in @xmath10 corresponding to this condensation is of third or higher order @xcite .",
    "the fixed @xmath10 ensemble is a kind of microcanonical ensemble .",
    "one can also consider ensembles with varying density .",
    "there are two natural candidates for such `` canonical '' ensembles  : for a fixed @xmath1 one can allow for varying @xmath0 by introducing a conjugate coupling to @xmath0 . in this",
    "formulation boxes decouple and we are left with @xmath1 copies of the urn model .",
    "alternatively for fixed @xmath0 one can allow for varying @xmath1 .",
    "this corresponds to the ensembles studied in lattice gravity @xcite and will be the subject of our investigations .",
    "the partition function for this canonical ensemble reads  : @xmath12 the canonical function can formally be treated as a discrete laplace transform of the microcanonical partition function @xmath13 as the second line of the equation above shows .",
    "analogously , in the same language , we can introduce the grand ",
    "canonical partition function as the laplace transform of the canonical one  : @xmath14 each box is assumed to contain at least one ball .",
    "therefore the sum in the last equation starts from @xmath15 .",
    "the weights @xmath2 are a priori independent parameters that we assume to be non  negative . in order that the large @xmath0 limit be well defined the weights can not grow faster than exponentially with @xmath3 . on the other hand",
    "the exponential growth factor is irrelevant from the point of view of the critical behaviour of the model , as can be seen below .",
    "namely , if one changes weights as  : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are some constants , the partition functions change as  : @xmath19 thus the change of the exponential factor in the weights merely causes a redefinition of the coupling constants @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "so from the point of view of the phase structure of the model , only the sub - exponential factors of weights matter . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to the power like weights  : @xmath22 which capture a variety of essential phase transitions in the model .",
    "some remarks on the behaviour for weights of general form can be found in @xcite .    in the large @xmath0 limit",
    "the model can be solved analytically @xcite . the free energy  : @xmath23 has a singularity in @xmath21 at @xmath24 , for @xmath25 and has no singularity otherwise .",
    "@xmath26 is the riemann zeta function .",
    "the phase for @xmath27 is called fluid , and for @xmath28 condensed .",
    "the order parameter for the transition is the first derivative of the free energy with respect to @xmath21 which corresponds to the inverse average density of balls per box  : @xmath29 it vanishes in the condensed phase _",
    "ie _ for @xmath30 .",
    "the average @xmath31 is taken with respect to the canonical ensemble ( [ z ] ) .",
    "the order of the transition depends on @xmath32 . for @xmath32 in the range @xmath33",
    "the transition is first order .",
    "when @xmath34 approaches the critical point the order parameter goes to a nonzero constant @xmath35 corresponding to the discontinuity of the order parameter at the critical point .",
    "if one treats @xmath1 in the partition function ( [ z ] ) as the energy of the system , then the discontinuity of @xmath36 corresponds to the latent heat .",
    "for @xmath37 the latent heat vanishes and the transition becomes continuous . for @xmath32 in the range",
    "@xmath38 $ ] , @xmath36 has a branch point singularity at @xmath39 . in this case",
    ", the order parameter vanishes when one approaches the critical point @xmath40  : @xmath41{where } x_1 = \\frac{2-\\beta}{\\beta-1 } \\quad .",
    "\\label{x}\\ ] ] the transition is @xmath42-th order for @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "when @xmath32 approaches one ( @xmath44 ) the transition becomes softer and softer ( @xmath45 ) and eventually disappears at @xmath46 . for @xmath32",
    "smaller than one the system has only a fluid phase and displays no phase transition .",
    "let us denote the most singular term in the free energy by @xmath47 and the related exponent by @xmath48  : @xmath49 to match it with the scaling ( [ x ] ) for @xmath50 , we must have  : @xmath51    for large but finite @xmath0 one expects that this behaviour gets substituted by the double scaling law with two exponents which we denote by @xmath52 and @xmath53(see @xcite and reference therein )  : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a certain universal function of one argument @xmath56 . when @xmath57 is fixed and @xmath0 goes to infinity one expects to asymptotically recover the singularity of the thermodynamic limit @xmath58 independent of @xmath0 .",
    "this means that the universal function must have the following large @xmath59 behaviour  : @xmath60 and  : @xmath61    the singular part of the free energy is mixed with less singular and analytic parts . while for @xmath62 the @xmath63 will eventually dominate over less singular parts it can still itself be dominated by the analytic part .",
    "it is therefore difficult to extract the scaling part @xmath63 directly from the function @xmath64 .",
    "instead , one does it by calculating the @xmath42-th derivative of @xmath64 for @xmath42 large enough that the exponent @xmath65 is negative .",
    "we use the convention that the exponent @xmath65 is the power @xmath66 of the most singular part of the @xmath42-th derivative .",
    "thus we trivially have @xmath67 .",
    "the first value of @xmath68 for which @xmath65 is negative , gives the order of the transition .",
    "for this @xmath42 , the singular part of the @xmath42-th derivative blows up at @xmath39 and dominates the analytic part .",
    "therefore in this case one can skip the subscript @xmath69 when writing a scaling formula analogous to ( [ fss ] ) for divergent derivatives  : @xmath70 keeping in mind that there are corrections , ( denoted by dots ) which may be important for finite @xmath0 .",
    "asymptotically , for @xmath71 they are , however , negligible in comparison to the displayed part .",
    "the knowledge of the exponent @xmath48 does not suffice to calculate @xmath52 and @xmath53 . in the standard finite size scaling analysis the value of the exponent @xmath53",
    "can be obtained by a simple argument @xcite .",
    "there are two relevant length scales in a @xmath72dimensional system undergoing a continuous phase transition  : the linear extension @xmath73 and the correlation length @xmath59 , diverging as @xmath74 , when @xmath75 goes to zero . the critical behaviour sets in when the lengths become comparable  : @xmath76 giving  : @xmath77 alternatively one can say that critical properties of the system depend on the dimensionless ratio  : @xmath78 . we use here a similar reasoning .",
    "namely , we extract characteristic scales from the distribution of the box occupancy number @xmath79 _ ie _ the probability that a box has @xmath3 balls  : @xmath80 in the large @xmath0 limit the distribution has the form  : @xmath81 as can be seen from ( [ phi ] ) .",
    "there are two scales which govern this distribution when the critical point is approached from the fluid phase  : the damping scale factor @xmath82^{-1}$ ] and the system size @xmath0 .",
    "thus , in analogy to ( [ fisher_crit ] ) one expects that the dimensionless combination of the scales which defines universal critical properties of the system is  : @xmath83^{-1}/n$ ] . using the relation ( [ phi_sing ] ) we eventually get  : @xmath84 inserting this into ( [ fss ] ) we obtain @xmath85 .",
    "this is a sort of fisher scaling relation and @xmath86 , the exponent @xmath87 is the heat capacity exponent _ ie _ the second cumulant of energy .",
    "thus , the relation @xmath88 corresponds to @xmath89 , known as josephson s or fisher s law . ] .",
    "there are some thermodynamic inequalities which follow directly from the fisher relation .",
    "firstly , one can see that @xmath53 must be greater than zero , @xmath90 , in order that there exist @xmath42 such that @xmath91 .",
    "otherwise there were no transition .",
    "this inequality is in accordance with the inequality @xmath92 which gives the condition for existence of the transition in this model , as discussed in the text after the equation ( [ x ] ) .",
    "secondly , @xmath93 must be smaller than one @xmath94 which amounts to @xmath95 .",
    "this is because the second cumulant may not grow faster than @xmath96 as can be seen from ( [ f2 ] ) by taking into account the fact that values of @xmath1 lie in the range @xmath97 $ ] .",
    "in fact the limiting value @xmath98 corresponds to the first order transition scaling which follows from the presence of a non  vanishing latent heat gives the canonical exponent @xmath99 . ]",
    "_ ie _ @xmath100 .",
    "this holds for all @xmath101 . in this range of @xmath32",
    "the exponents @xmath102 are constant , while the discontinuity @xmath103 changes with @xmath32 .    formula ( [ fssn ] ) gives a practical way of computing the most relevant singularity of the partition function from the finite size analysis of numerical data .",

    "the universal scaling properties are obtained from comparing two scales present in the model  : the inverse of an exponential fall ",
    "off parameter of the effective probability distribution @xmath79 and the system size @xmath0 .",
    "the former one measures the extent of fluctuations of the number balls in a box and the latter one serves as a natural cut - off of those fluctuations . as mentioned in the introduction this type of transition plays an important role in many physical systems .",
    "in particular it is relevant for understanding the transition in lattice gravity models .",
    "the model provides a nice example of the finite size pattern for a first order phase transition .",
    "the results for the distribution are exact and easily reproducible so one can measure all relevant quantities and quickly test any new ideas .",
    "thus , we hope , the model may also prove useful for studying generic properties of first order transitions .",
