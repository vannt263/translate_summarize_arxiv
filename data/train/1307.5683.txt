    "a positive @xmath341 means that @xmath34 should be enhanced ( more negative ) , whereas a negative @xmath341 requires @xmath34 to be reduced in magnitude ( less negative ) .",
    "several comments are in order .",
    "first , one can see that the region between 1 and 6 gev@xmath22 is little affected by the long - distance contribution , and gets either an enhancement of np effects in @xmath34 ( for @xmath342 gev ) or a very small depletion ( for @xmath343 gev ) from the short - distance part .",
    "in the case of the [ 4.3,8.68 ] bin , one has to remember that the negative contribution @xmath344 when varying @xmath316 from 1.27 to 1.4 gev has to be integrated over the whole bin , leading to a shift of at most @xmath86 for @xmath34 from this bin ( one finds a contribution of similar size for the imaginary part of @xmath5 , which is however more difficult to interpret directly in terms of a shift of @xmath34 , taken real here ) .",
    "we see therefore that _ a ) _ charm - loop effects affect very marginally our analysis using @xmath222 observables in the [ 1,6 ] bin only , and _ b _ ) these long - distance charm contributions will tend to enhance ( rather than reduce ) the need for a negative @xmath34 for the analysis including thinner bins , closer to the photon and @xmath329 poles .",
    "we have checked the sensitivity of our analysis to these effects ( charm - loop effects and charm - mass dependence ) by considering the least favourable situation for np , where the charm quark mass is shifted from 1.27 gev to 1.4 gev and long - distance contributions are neglected . the need for @xmath345 remains , with a slight decrease in significance ( by less than @xmath276 ) and a small shift of the best - fit value for @xmath34 ( by @xmath346 , in agreement with our previous discussion ) .",
    "a second issue consists in the sensitivity to the framework used to describe @xmath222 form factors and amplitudes . following refs .",
    "@xcite , we have adopted the qcd factorisation framework .",
    "one issue still under discussion is the uncertainty coming from @xmath347 corrections . as a check of the robustness of our results with respect to this issue ,",
    "we have increased the uncertainties coming from @xmath347 corrections by 3 , resulting in a slight decrease of the pull for the sm hypothesis in the @xmath348 scenario from @xmath349 to @xmath350 for the analysis based on the 3 large - recoil bins of @xmath222 ( multiplying the same uncertainties by 6 decreases the significance down to @xmath351 ) .    if our uncertainties stemming from refs .",
    "@xcite are fairly standard , one can find alternative estimates for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite , where larger uncertainties for @xmath352 at large recoil are obtained due to significantly larger power - suppressed corrections .",
    "the size of these power corrections and their @xmath17-dependence was obtained from the spread between different estimates of the form factors ( several sum - rule computations in different settings and dyson - schwinger equations ) . if this approach is certainly conservative , it mixes frameworks with very different levels of accuracy , @xmath17 ranges of validity , and correlations between the various form factors . indeed , as noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the form factors are estimated in a conventional basis which is different from the helicity basis needed for the computation of the transversity amplitudes .",
    "our lack of knowledge concerning the correlations among these form factors increases the uncertainties on the helicity form factors very significantly . in our mind , averaging different parametrisations ( some of them not being updated to their latest values ) given in this conventional basis tends to overestimate the power - suppressed corrections in the helicity form factors .",
    "however , we agree with ref .",
    "@xcite that a first - principle computation of the helicity form factors would be the best way to improve the accuracy on this type of systematics .",
    "one could also consider the alternative approach of naive factorisation following , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite : the form factors are then treated as independent and not reduced to two form factors @xmath353 , and contributions to the transversity amplitudes from hard - gluon interactions ( in particular , spectator interaction ) are neglected . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , these two approaches yield slightly shifted results for the @xmath17 dependence of some observables , but they agree on their qualitative variations .",
    "we have performed fits identical to the ones presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : c7c9 ] , with very similar results [ preference for @xmath29 , sm hypothesis with a large pull but less significance for the large - recoil data ] , indicating that our results are robust with respect to the use of naive or nlo qcd factorisation .",
    "we have combined the recent lhcb measurements of @xmath222 observables  @xcite with other radiative modes in a fit to wilson coefficients , using the framework of our previous works  @xcite .",
    "we have found a strong indication for a negative np contribution to the coefficient @xmath5 , at @xmath354 using large - recoil data ( @xmath355 using both large- and low - recoil data ) .",
    "our results correspond to @xmath5 inside a 68 % c.l .",
    "range @xmath356 to be compared with @xmath357 at the scale @xmath14 gev .",
    "this is the main conclusion of our analysis of lhcb @xmath222 measurements .",
    "we also observe a slight preference for negative values in @xmath33 ( mainly driven by radiative constraints ) , but no clear - cut evidence for @xmath358 .",
    "the situation for @xmath359 could be clarified with a substantial reduction of error bars in @xmath25 , whereas the case for @xmath360 is supported by the data at large recoil , but not at low recoil ( an illustration of the improvement brought by @xmath360 at large recoil is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : p2c9c9prime ] ) .",
    "we emphasise that the same mechanism @xmath29 ( @xmath361 ) is remarkably efficient and economical in explaining the whole pattern of deviations indicated by the recent lhcb results  @xcite : small discrepancies in @xmath19 , tensions in @xmath24 and @xmath298 , preference for a higher position of the zero of @xmath19 and @xmath24 .",
    "if this pattern is confirmed , it remains to determine what kind of np could accommodate a situation where @xmath29 is large , with the possibility of additional contributions to @xmath33 and @xmath362 .",
    "a natural possibility would consist in a @xmath363 gauge boson  @xcite , coupling to left - handed quarks only but equally to left- and right - handed charged leptons , and with flavour - changing couplings to down - type quarks .",
    "this category of models and the flavour constraints set on them were discussed in ref .",

    "it is essential that the lhcb experiment provides future results for @xmath222 with a finer @xmath17 binning , with several narrow bins between 1 and 6 gev@xmath22 , and a summary of the correlations among the various measurements . on the theoretical side ,",
    "since @xmath5 seems to be the main wilson coefficient affected by np , charm - loop effects become a very important issue , with several questions left open",
    ". it would be very useful for the theorists to converge on the scheme and the scale of the perturbative charm - quark contribution , as well as to provide alternative and/or improved estimates of the long - distance contribution obtained in ref .",

    "<S> we present a global analysis of the @xmath0 decay using the recent lhcb measurements of the primary observables @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> some of them exhibit large deviations with respect to the sm predictions . </S>",
    "<S> we explain the observed pattern of deviations through a large new physics contribution to the wilson coefficient of the semileptonic operator @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this contribution has an opposite sign to the sm one , i.e. , reduces the size of this coefficient significantly . </S>",
    "<S> a good description of data is achieved by allowing for new physics contributions to the wilson coefficients @xmath4 and @xmath5 only . </S>",
    "<S> we find a 4.5@xmath6 deviation with respect to the sm prediction , combining the large - recoil @xmath0 observables with other radiative processes . </S>",
    "<S> once low - recoil observables are included the significance gets reduced to 3.9@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we have tested different sources of systematics , none of them modifying our conclusions significantly . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we propose additional ways of measuring the primary observables through new foldings .    </S>",
    "<S> the four - body @xmath7 decay and its plethora of different observables  @xcite is becoming one of the key players not only in our search for new physics ( np ) in the flavour sector but also to guide us in the construction of viable new models , which explains the remarkable experimental effort devoted to its precise measurement  @xcite . in the effective hamiltonian approach used to analyse radiative decays at low energies , one of the most prominent virtues of this decay is the capacity to unveil np contributions inside the short - distance wilson coefficients , denoted @xmath8 , not only for the standard model ( sm ) electromagnetic and dileptonic operators @xmath9 ( with the usual @xmath10 chirality projection operators ) but also for the chirally - flipped operators @xmath11 as well as the scalar and pseudoscalar operators @xmath12 . among these , </S>",
    "<S> the only non - negligible wilson coefficients in the sm are @xmath13 at @xmath14  gev . </S>",
    "<S> the correlations between the wilson coefficients constitute a unique test ground to find consistent patterns pointing towards specific np models .    however , the presence of hadronic effects can easily hide a np signal . for this reason , </S>",
    "<S> it is essential to design an optimised basis of observables , easy to measure , with low hadronic and high np sensitivities . in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we proposed such a basis , consisting of @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( primary observables with a low sensitivity to form - factor uncertainties at low dilepton invariant mass @xmath17 ) , together with @xmath18 ( or @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 ( containing large uncertainties but required to complete the basis ) .    </S>",
    "<S> there has been an evolution in the type of observables measured by lhcb . </S>",
    "<S> it started with the set of observables @xmath19 , @xmath18 and @xmath21  @xcite , all of them rather sensitive to hadronic uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results pointed towards a scenario consistent with the sm , but with small deviations in @xmath19 ( in both the @xmath17 bin [ 2 - 4.3 ] gev@xmath22 and the position of the zero ) . </S>",
    "<S> the next generation of measurements included a theoretically - controlled version of @xmath19 called @xmath23  @xcite or @xmath24  @xcite , and @xmath25 , which are both less sensitive to hadronic effects and able to magnify deviations due to np . </S>",
    "<S> finally , lhcb has issued very recent results  @xcite completing the basis of @xmath26 and @xmath27 primary observables  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these observables , with little sensitivity to hadronic uncertainties at low @xmath17 , have unveiled a set of tensions with respect to the sm that have to be understood from the theoretical point of view . </S>",
    "<S> this paper aims at providing such a consistent picture , where the wilson coefficient @xmath5 plays an essential role .    in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ s1 ] we discuss the experimental evidence , i.e. , the pattern of deviations observed at lhcb . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec:2 ] , we present the main results and the details of our analysis of data using our basis of observables . finally , in sec .  [ sec:3 ] </S>",
    "<S> we explore the robustness of these results analysing different sources of uncertainty , namely , their sensitivity to perturbative and non - perturbative charm effects , large power - suppressed corrections as well as the comparison between naive and nlo qcd factorisations . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss possible improvements on the control of the s - wave pollution in an appendix . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude by suggesting cross - checks of our findings and further prospects for similar analyses . </S>"
