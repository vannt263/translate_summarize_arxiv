    "dimensions can be seen as a tool for measuring the non - regularity , or fractality , of a given object .",
    "non - integrality of the dimension is a first sign of non - regularity . a second kind of non - regularity is related to the fact that the dimension is not a global constant",
    "this may happen in two ways : either the dimension varies from point to point , or it has an oscillating behavior at a point . indeed dimensions are often defined as limits , and an oscillating behavior means that the upper and lower versions of the considered dimension are different .",
    "our main goal here is to introduce a local dimension that is able to maximally detect such an oscillating behavior , namely for which the upper and lower determinations form a maximal dimensional interval . with this aim",
    ", we shall define the upper and lower tangential dimension for a metric space .",
    "we mention at this point that such dimensions , which are presented here in a completely `` classic '' way , have been introduced first for noncommutative spaces @xcite , where their definition is purely noncommutative , depending on the oscillating behavior of the eigenvalues of the dirac operator , which may imply that the ( singular ) traceability exponents form an interval , rather than a singleton .",
    "the name tangential is motivated here by the fact that , under suitable hypotheses , such dimensions are the supremum , resp .",
    "infimum , of the local dimensions of the tangent sets for the given space .",
    "the notion of tangent set ( or rather tangent cone , cf .",
    "remark [ rem : tangenti ] ) for a metric space is due to gromov @xcite .",
    "a tangent set of a metric space @xmath0 at a point @xmath1 is any limit point of the family of its dilations , for the dilation parameter going to infinity , taken in the pointed gromov - hausdorff topology .    as an example we mention some fractals considered in @xcite .",
    "they are constructed as follows . at each step",
    "the sides of an equilateral triangle are divided in @xmath2 equal parts , so as to obtain @xmath3 equal equilateral triangles , and then all downward pointing triangles are removed , so that @xmath4 triangles are left . setting @xmath5 if @xmath6 and @xmath7 if @xmath8 , @xmath9 , we get a translation fractal with dimensions given by @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 denote the lower tangential , the upper tangential , the lower local and the upper local dimensions . the first four steps ( @xmath12 ) of the procedure above",
    "are shown in figure [ fig : sierp ] .    the procedure considered above",
    "can , of course , be applied also to other shapes .",
    "for example , at each step the sides of a square are divided in @xmath13 , @xmath2 , equal parts , so as to obtain @xmath14 equal squares , and then @xmath15 squares are removed , so that to remain with a chessboard . in particular , we may set @xmath5 if @xmath16 and @xmath17 if @xmath18 , @xmath19 , getting a translation fractal with dimensions given by @xcite @xmath20    the first three steps ( @xmath21 ) of this procedure are shown in figure [ fig : vics ] .",
    "the fractals considered above belong to a general class of fractals , called translation fractals . in a forthcoming paper @xcite , we shall show that for such fractals the metric tangential dimensions coincide with the tangential dimensions of an invariant measure , in this way obtaining an explicit formula for the dimensions .",
    "translation fractals can also be studied from a noncommutative point of view , and commutative and noncommutative tangential dimensions coincide .",
