    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the fundamental theory of the strong interaction .",
    "qcd is an asymptotically free theory @xcite , i.e. , interactions between quarks and gluons become weaker as the mutual distance decreases or as the exchanged momentum increases . consequently , at very large temperatures and/or densities , the interactions which confine quarks and gluons inside hadrons should become sufficiently weak to release them @xcite .",
    "the phase where quarks and gluons are deconfined is termed the _ quark - gluon plasma _ ( qgp ) .",
    "lattice qcd calculations have established the existence of such a phase of strongly interacting matter at temperatures larger than @xmath0 mev and zero net - baryon density .",
    "depending on the number of quark flavors and the masses of the quarks , the transition between ordinary hadronic matter and the qgp could be a thermodynamic phase transition of first order , of second order , or simply a crossover transition .",
    "the qgp was certainly present in the evolution of the early universe .",
    "the early universe was very hot , but close to net - baryon free . in the opposite limit of small temperature and large baryon density",
    ", the qgp may exist even nowadays in the interior of compact stellar objects such as neutron stars .",
    "the main effort in present - day nuclear physics is to create the qgp under controlled conditions in the laboratory via collisions of heavy nuclei at ultrarelativistic energies @xcite .",
    "the temperatures and net - baryon densities reached in nuclear collisions depend on the bombarding energy .",
    "they interpolate between the extreme conditions of the early universe on one side and compact stellar objects on the other .",
    "if at all , the qgp is only transiently created in a nuclear collision ; free quarks and gluons will not be released .",
    "therefore , deciding whether a qgp was formed or not is not easy .",
    "detectors in the laboratory can only measure hadrons , leptons , or photons .",
    "the bulk of the particles emerging from a nuclear collision are hadrons with transverse momenta of order @xmath1 gev .",
    "they carry information about the final stage of the collision after hadronization of the qgp .",
    "the formation of the latter can only indirectly influence this final stage , for instance by modifying the collective dynamics of the system through a softening of the equation of state in the hadronization transition @xcite .",
    "very few hadrons are emitted with transverse momenta of the order of several gev .",
    "they arise from the fragmentation of jets and may carry information also about the earlier stages of the collision . of particular interest",
    "is the situation where the jet has to traverse hot and dense matter possibly formed in the collision and is quenched by multiple rescattering in the medium @xcite . from this `` jet - quenching '' process one",

    "finally , leptons and photons only interact electromagnetically .",
    "once formed in the early stage of the collision , they leave the system unimpededly and carry information about this stage to the detector @xcite .",
    "the difficulty is to disentangle the thermal radiation from a hot , equilibrated qgp @xcite from the initial production of leptons and photons in the very first , highly energetic partonic collisions and from the thermal radiation of hot hadronic matter @xcite .    in order to decide whether a qgp was formed , one has to have detailed knowledge about its properties .",

    "section  [ seciii ] gives an overview of what is known about the qgp from analytic calculations .",
    "the most simple approach from a conceptual ( albeit not technical ) point of view is to determine the thermodynamical properties of the qgp by a perturbative computation of the qcd partition function in terms of a power series in the strong coupling constant , @xmath13 .",
    "this can be done up to terms of order @xmath14 . at order @xmath15 ,",
    "the perturbative series breaks down @xcite , and the remaining nonperturbative contribution has to be determined , for instance , from a lattice qcd calculation .",
    "those terms of the perturbative series , which are analytically computable , are rapidly decreasing in magnitude at high temperatures where the strong coupling constant is small , @xmath16 .",
    "this gives rise to the hope that only the first few terms of the perturbative series are actually necessary to obtain physically reasonable values for the qcd partition function . for temperatures of order @xmath0 mev ,",
    "however , @xmath17 and the perturbative series is obviously not convergent .",
    "therefore , one has tried other ways to compute the partition function , either by expanding around a nonperturbative ground state or by resumming certain classes of diagrams to improve the convergence properties of the perturbative series . in both approaches ,",
    "quarks and gluons are considered as quasiparticles with a dispersion relation which is modified as compared to the one in the vacuum .",

    "two examples for this behavior , the liquid - gas transition in nuclear matter and the quark - hadron transition , have already been seen in the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter , fig .",
    "[ phasediagramnm ] , and will be discussed in more detail in the following .",
    "the liquid - gas transition in nuclear matter is a consequence of the fact that nuclear matter assumes its ground state at a nonvanishing baryon density @xmath68 at zero temperature @xmath69 .",
    "the underlying microscopic mechanism for this phenomenon is a competition between attractive and repulsive forces among nucleons , with the attraction winning at this particular value of the baryon density .",
    "( this is good , because otherwise there would be no stable atomic nuclei , precluding the existence of our universe as we know it . ) in infinite , isospin - symmetric nuclear matter , nucleons in the ground state are bound by @xmath70 mev ( if one neglects the coulomb repulsion ) , i.e. , the energy per baryon is @xmath71 mev , where @xmath72 is the energy density , @xmath73 the baryon density , and @xmath74 mev is the rest mass of the nucleon .",
    "nuclear matter is mechanically stable in the ground state , such that the pressure vanishes , @xmath75 .",
    "from the fundamental relation of thermodynamics , @xmath76 , one then concludes that the baryon chemical potential in the ground state is identical to the energy per baryon , @xmath77 mev . since a baryon consists of three quarks , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "hence , the ground state of nuclear matter is the point @xmath80 mev in the nuclear matter phase diagram .    obviously , it costs energy to compress nuclear matter to baryon densities @xmath81 .",
    "such an increase in energy leads to an increase in pressure . at zero temperature , this can be immediately seen from the identity @xmath82 . since the pressure is a monotonous function of the thermodynamic variables , and since it vanishes in the ground state , there are only two possibilities for the behavior of @xmath66 for densities @xmath83 : either the pressure remains zero as the density decreases , @xmath84 , or the pressure further decreases such that @xmath85 .",
    "the latter possibility implies that the system becomes mechanically unstable .",
    "this can be prevented by fragmenting nuclear matter into droplets .",
    "these droplets are mechanically stable , i.e. , the density inside each droplet is equal to @xmath86 and the pressure vanishes .",
    "the total baryon density in the system can be further reduced by simply decreasing the droplet density .",
    "the pressure in such a system remains zero down to arbitrarily small densities , because compression just results in a decrease of the space between droplets .",
    "thus , @xmath84 from @xmath87 to @xmath88 , and then @xmath89 for @xmath90 .    at small , but nonzero temperatures ,",
    "this picture remains valid , with the additional possibility to thermally evaporate single nucleons from the surface of the droplets . at small temperatures and densities below the ground state density ,",
    "one thus has a mixed phase of nucleons and droplets of nuclear matter .",
    "this is reminiscent of water which , at room temperature and normal pressure , consists of a mixed phase of water molecules and water droplets . changing the density one can alter the relative fraction of molecules and droplets . beyond the density where droplets fill the entire volume one enters the liquid phase , while below the density where the last droplet fragments into molecules one enters the gas phase .",
    "this behavior is typical for a first - order phase transition . in this case , this is the so - called liquid - gas transition in water .",
    "nuclear matter shows a similar behavior , featuring a `` gaseous '' phase of nucleons at small chemical potentials ( densities ) and a `` liquid '' phase of nuclear matter at large chemical potentials ( densities ) , cf .",
    "[ phasediagramnm ] . at small temperatures",
    "the transition between the two phases is of first order .",
    "thus , in the @xmath64 phase diagram there is a line of first - order phase transitions extending from the nuclear ground state @xmath91 mev up towards larger values of @xmath2 and smaller values of @xmath3 .",
    "as for water , this line terminates at a critical point where the transition becomes of second order .",
    "the critical temperature is of the order of 10 mev . as for water",
    ", one can not distinguish between the gaseous and the liquid phase for temperatures above this critical temperature .",
    "the existence of the liquid - gas phase transition has been confirmed in heavy - ion collision experiments at bevalac and gsi energies ( @xmath9 agev ) , although the precise value for the critical temperature and the critical exponents remain a matter of debate @xcite .",
    "the liquid - gas transition is also a feature of phenomenological models for the nuclear interaction , for instance , the walecka model @xcite . in the following section another phase transition in strongly interacting matter",
    "is discussed , which very much resembles the liquid - gas transition in that it ( most likely ) is of first order for small temperatures and terminates in a critical point where the transition becomes of second order .",
    "this transition is the so - called quark - hadron transition .        for a non - interacting , translationally invariant system a convenient basis of states",
    "are the single - particle momentum eigenstates . due to the pauli principle",
    ", the density in a fermionic system can only be increased by successively filling states with higher momentum .",
    "the highest filled state defines the fermi surface of the system , and the corresponding momentum is the fermi momentum , @xmath92 . for non - interacting systems at zero temperature , the single - particle density @xmath22 is given in terms of the fermi momentum as @xmath93 where @xmath94 counts the internal degrees of freedom of the fermion ( like spin , color , flavor , etc . ) .",
    "thus , at large densities the fermi momentum becomes large .    in a cold",
    ", dense fermionic system particles can only scatter elastically if their momenta lie on the fermi surface , as states below the fermi surface are not accessible due to the pauli principle ( the so called `` pauli - blocking '' phenomenon ) , and states above the fermi surface are not accessible due to energy conservation .",
    "if the fermi momentum exceeds the qcd scale parameter @xmath95 mev , scattering events between nucleons start to probe distances of the order 1 fm or less , i.e. , the nucleonic substructure of quarks and gluons becomes visible .",
    "the fermi momentum in the ground state of nuclear matter can be inferred from eq .",
    "( [ density ] ) to be @xmath96 mev .",
    "this is already of the order of @xmath97 .",
    "nevertheless , a description of nuclear matter in terms of nucleonic degrees of freedom is certainly feasible around the ground state . at which densities",
    "does a description in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom become more appropriate ?",
    "the `` volume '' occupied by a single nucleon can be estimated from its charge radius to be @xmath98 .",
    "on the other hand , the specific volume of the system in the ground state is @xmath99 . in this sense ,",
    "nuclear matter in the ground state is dilute .",
    "however , increasing the density to about @xmath100 , the system becomes densely packed with nucleons . at larger densities",
    ", they will even start to overlap .",
    "therefore , around densities of a few times nuclear matter ground state density , one expects that a description of the system in terms of quarks and gluons is more appropriate",
    ".    similar arguments also apply to a system at nonzero temperature , even when the net - baryon number density is small . at nonzero temperature ,",
    "nuclear matter consists not only of nucleons but also of other , thermally excited hadrons . for a non - interacting system in thermodynamical equilibrium and neglecting quantum statistics ,",
    "the hadron number densities are proportional to @xmath101 , where @xmath102 labels the hadron species , @xmath103 is their mass , @xmath104 is their chemical potential , and @xmath105 is a modified bessel function of the second kind . for nonzero temperature and small net - baryon number density ,",
    "the lightest hadrons , the pions , are most abundant . at nonzero temperature and small baryon chemical potential ,",
    "the typical momentum scale for scattering events between hadrons is set by the temperature @xmath2 .",
    "if the temperature is on the order of or larger than @xmath97 , scattering between hadrons starts to probe their quark - gluon substructure .",
    "moreover , since the particle density increases with the temperature , the hadronic wave functions will start to overlap for large temperatures .",
    "consequently , above a certain temperature one expects a description of nuclear matter in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom to be more appropriate .",
    "the picture which emerges from these considerations is the following : for quark chemical potentials @xmath3 which are on the order of 350 mev or smaller , and for temperatures @xmath106 mev , nuclear matter is a gas of hadrons .",
    "( at very small temperatures @xmath107 mev , there is a gaseous and a liquid nucleonic phase , cf .",
    "[ lgtrans ] . ) on the other hand , for @xmath108 , nuclear matter consists of quarks and gluons .",
    "the natural question which emerges is , whether the `` hadron phase '' and the `` quark - gluon phase '' ( the qgp ) are separated by a phase transition in the thermodynamic sense .",
    "the rigorous way to decide this question is by identifying an order parameter which is nonzero in one phase and zero in the other . this will be discussed in more detail in the following .",
    "let us first study the pure @xmath109 $ ] gauge theory , i.e. , qcd without dynamical quarks ( sometimes also termed the @xmath110 case ) .",
    "in this theory , there is a phase transition between a low - temperature and a high - temperature phase , cf .",

    "this indicates the liberation of colored degrees of freedom , i.e. , deconfinement .",
    "the expectation value of the polyakov loop is therefore the order parameter for the deconfinement transition .    for an @xmath109 $ ] gauge theory",
    "the action has a global @xmath120 symmetry : the action does not change when multiplying all time - like links at a given spatial position @xmath121 by an element @xmath122 of the center @xmath120 of the gauge group @xmath109 $ ] . in the high - temperature phase ,",
    "the nonzero expectation value of the polyakov loop breaks this symmetry spontaneously .",
    "in the low - temperature phase , @xmath118 , and this symmetry is restored . for two colors , @xmath123 , the effective theory in the critical region around the phase transition is given by a @xmath124 spin model , i.e. , it is in the same universality class as the ising model @xcite .",

    "the condensate is still invariant under vector transformations in color and flavor space , or in other words , a transformation in color requires a simultaneous transformation in flavor to preserve the invariance of the condensate .",
    "therefore , the discoverers @xcite of this 3-flavor color - superconducting state termed it the `` * c*olor-*f*lavor-*l*ocked '' , or short , `` cfl '' state .",
    "the residual @xmath285 symmetry is no longer a local symmetry , so that there are no massless gluons . the complete pattern of symmetry breaking , including the @xmath144 symmetry of baryon number and the @xmath261 $ ] symmetry of electromagnetism is @xmath238 \\times su(3)_v \\times u(1)_v \\times [ u(1)_{\\rm em } ] \\rightarrow su(3)_{c+v } \\times [ \\tilde{u}(1)]$ ] .",
    "( this notation is slightly ambiguous : the @xmath261 $ ] symmetry is generated by the quark charge operator @xmath286 which is traceless .",

    "in addition to the eight massive gluons , there are also ten real goldstone bosons , eight from the breaking of the @xmath289 chiral symmetry , and one each from the breaking of @xmath144 and @xmath146 .",
    "closer inspection @xcite shows that the excitation spectrum in the cfl state bears a striking resemblance to the one in the hadronic phase .",
    "let us first focus on the fermionic sector . in the cfl phase , there are nine gapped fermionic quasiparticles ( cf .",
    "also sec .",
    "[ secexspec ] ) , eight of which are degenerate in mass .",
    "these correspond to the baryon octet in the qcd vacuum .",

    "the ninth quasiparticle is twice as heavy and does not have a counterpart in hadronic matter , but this is not a reason to worry , as such a particle would have a large decay width into lighter particles . in the bosonic sector , there are nine goldstone bosons from the breaking of the axial @xmath290 symmetry , which correspond to the pseudoscalar nonet in the hadronic phase .",
    "only the tenth goldstone boson from the breaking of @xmath144 does not have a counterpart in the qcd vacuum .",
    "such a boson exists , however , in dense nuclear matter , where a superfluid @xmath291 condensate may form , which also breaks the @xmath144 baryon number symmetry .",
    "the preceding arguments have led to the conjecture of `` continuity '' between hadron and quark matter @xcite .",
    "this conjecture states that , since there is no difference in symmetry between quark matter in the cfl state and ( @xmath271 flavor - symmetric ) hadronic matter , there need not be any phase boundary between these two phases at all .",
    "of course , this requires that there is no other color - superconducting phase , for instance the 2sc state , which separates cfl matter from hadronic matter .    for @xmath202 ,",

    "consequently , like in the 2sc case only five gluons become massive , and blue up , down , and strange quarks do not participate in the formation of cooper pairs . additionally , there are also five goldstone bosons from the breaking of the flavor symmetry .",
    "there is a more technical and a more physical argument , why the cfl state is most likely realized in nature . from the more technical point of view",
    ", one can show @xcite that , to one - loop order , in qcd @xmath293 and @xmath200 . from the more physical point of view",
    ", the cfl state is energetically favored because _ all _ quark colors and flavors ( instead of just a few ) acquire a gap at the fermi surface .",
    "the gain in condensation energy is thus expected to be larger than for a state with a condensate of the form  ( [ 3sc ] ) .",

    "if one still assumes pairing to occur in the color @xmath256_a^c$ ] channel , the cooper pair wave function is , as required , overall antisymmetric . the condensate is a 3-vector in space which points in the direction of the spin of the cooper pair .",

    "only the eighth gluon mixes with the photon , this diagonalization is achieved by a simple orthogonal rotation in the @xmath305 block corresponding to the indices @xmath306 .",
    "the resulting diagonal ( squared ) debye masses @xmath307 and ( squared ) meissner masses @xmath308 , as well as the ( square of the ) cosine of the rotation angles @xmath309 , @xmath310 are shown in table  [ tableunmix ] . in the case of an unbroken @xmath264 $ ] symmetry , cf .",
    "table  [ table1 ] , the `` rotated '' ( magnetic ) photon is massless .",
    "the `` rotated '' gluon remains massive , but its degeneracy with the other massive gluons is lifted .",

    "however , in the case of two or more quark flavors with different electric charges , the results change @xcite .",

    "consequently , spin - one color - superconducting quark matter exhibits a meissner effect , while color superconductors with spin - zero cooper pairs do not .",
    "due to the smallness of the ratio @xmath315 for spin - one color superconductors , these are very likely of type i , i.e. , the magnetic field is completely expelled .",
    "this is in contrast to the standard model of a neutron star , where the core is assumed to be a type - ii superconductor and thus threaded by magnetic flux tubes .",
    "it was recently argued in ref .",

    "in this review , i have presented the current knowledge of the equilibrium properties of strongly interacting matter at large temperatures and/or densities . in particular , i have qualitatively discussed the phase diagram .",
    "i have presented calculations of thermodynamic properties of strongly interacting matter , both via lattice qcd , as well as within analytic approaches .",
    "finally , i have given an overview of color superconductivity in weak coupling .",
    "our knowledge of the qcd phase transition and the qgp at zero quark chemical potential has tremendously increased over the last few years .",
    "lattice qcd calculations are well under control for the pure @xmath238 $ ] gauge theory , and the quality of the data is such that an extrapolation to the continuum limit as well as to the thermodynamic limit has become possible .",
    "lattice calculations with dynamical fermions are more challenging and , consequently , the data are not of the same quality as for the pure gauge theory .",
    "the main problem is that , with present methods of putting fermions on the lattice , the pion comes out too heavy .",
    "since pions dominate the equation of state in the hadronic phase , calculations of the pressure below the chiral restoration temperature do not yet reflect the correct physics .",
    "the challenge for the future is to improve the methods such that the pion mass on the lattice is close to the value in nature . besides a reliable computation of the equation of state",
    ", this will also allow to decide the question about the order of the qcd phase transition in nature .    another important development in lattice",
    "qcd is to extend the investigation of thermodynamic properties to nonzero quark chemical potentials . for many years",
    ", the fermion sign problem has impeded progress in this direction .",
    "recent attempts , like multiparameter reweighting , taylor expansion around @xmath225 , or analytic continuation from imaginary values of @xmath3 , have made an attempt to work around this problem .",
    "much work remains to be done to improve these methods in order to correctly determine the location of the critical point in the @xmath64 plane .",
    "this is of great phenomenological importance : in order to find a signal for the first - order phase transition to the qgp in nuclear collisions , one has to tune the bombarding energy such that one probes the region of the phase diagram , which is to the right of the critical point .",
    "nuclear collisions at very high energies most likely probe the region to the left , i.e. , the crossover region of the quark - hadron transition . by definition",
    ", there is no qualitative difference between hadronic and qgp phase in this region , and a clear signal for the qgp will be hard to identify .",
    "although the question about the location of the critical point is important and can be investigated with the above mentioned lattice methods , these methods circumvent the fermion sign problem rather than solving it . moreover , they are only applicable for quark chemical potentials",
    "@xmath3 from zero up to values of order @xmath2 . therefore , one will ultimately have to find a true solution which also works at small temperatures and large chemical potential , so that the color - superconducting quark matter phase can be explored .",
    "analytic approaches to compute the equation of state of strongly interacting matter at high temperature have advanced rapidly in recent years .",
    "the equation of state is now known to all orders which are perturbatively computable .",
    "work is in progress to determine the remaining nonperturbative contribution of order @xmath15 .",
    "resummation techniques have been applied to compute the thermodynamic properties of strongly interacting matter . at large temperatures",
    "@xmath316 , they suggest that the qgp is a gas of weakly interacting quasiparticles . however , when approaching the critical temperature from above , the approaches based on resummation techniques fail to describe lattice qcd data . at the moment , one seems to be forced to either abandon field - theoretical rigor in favor of simple quasiparticle models with sufficiently many fit parameters to reproduce the data , or turn to an alternative description , such as the polyakov loop model , which is physically less intuitive .",
    "it remains to be shown how this model is related to the quasiparticle picture at large temperatures .",
    "color superconductivity is a rapidly evolving field .",
    "it is fairly likely that color - superconducting quark matter can be found in the core of compact stellar objects .",
    "it remains to explore how this phase influences the properties of the star .",
    "much work has still to be done , for instance to compute the transport properties of color - superconducting matter and the phase diagram under the conditions of electric and color neutrality .",
    "although njl - type models may give a qualitative picture of possible scenarios , they are unreliable when one wants to draw quantitative conclusions .",
