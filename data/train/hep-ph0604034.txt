    "the gauge sector of electroweak interactions has been checked to coincide with the standard model ( sm ) prediction to the per - mil level , at lep and slc . on the contrary , there is no direct experimental evidence for the higgs mechanism , supposed to be responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking and the generation of masses .",
    "direct search of the higgs boson at lep yields the lower limit @xcite : @xmath2 gev / c@xmath1 at @xmath3 cl .",
    "precision measurements on the other hand give @xcite : @xmath4 gev / c@xmath1 at @xmath5 cl . once a higgs particle is found , if ever , all its properties should be measured precisely to completely characterise the higgs mechanism . among those ,",
    "the coupling of the higgs boson to fermions ( the yukawa coupling ) , which is supposed to scale with the fermion mass :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the yukawa coupling of a fermion f of mass @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field , @xmath10 gev .",
    "the top quark is the heaviest fermion , thus the top - higgs yukawa coupling should be the easiest to measure . if @xmath11 , this parameter can be measured through the branching ratio of the higgs boson decay into a pair of top quarks .",
    "otherwise , i.e. for lower values of the higgs boson mass , the process @xmath0 allows in principle a direct measurement of this coupling .",
    "feasibility studies of the measurement of the top - higgs yukawa coupling via the process @xmath0 at a linear collider have already been performed  @xcite  @xcite for a higgs boson mass of 120 - 130 gev / c@xmath1 .",
    "this is the most favourable case ( taking into account the lower mass bound ) as the cross - section of this process decreases with increasing higgs boson mass and as a higgs boson of such a mass decays predominantly to a pair of b quarks , allowing a very effective signal and background separation using b - tagging algorithms .",
    "one of the studies ( @xcite ) showed that a neural network analysis was essential to get a precise result .",
    "we repeated this work and extended it up to @xmath12 150 gev / c@xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath13 135 gev / c@xmath1 , the @xmath14 decay mode dominates .",
    "this channel was also studied , for masses up to 200 gev / c@xmath1 .",
    "the lowest order feynman diagrams contributing to the @xmath0 process are shown in figure  [ diagrammetth ] . the amplitude of the diagram where the higgs boson is radiated from the z boson is not expressing the top - higgs yukawa coupling .",
    "however , since it modifies only slightly the cross - section of the process , it can safely be neglected . the cross - section and",
    "the top - higgs yukawa coupling thus verify to a good approximation : @xmath15 .    for this work ,",
    "the following assumptions were made : @xmath16 gev / c@xmath1 and @xmath17 .",
    "the higgs branching ratios were calculated with the hdecay  @xcite program .",
