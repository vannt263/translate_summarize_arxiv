    "the collision of two high - energy photons can lead to the creation of an electron - positron ( @xmath0 ) pair and is referred to as breit - wheeler process @xcite .",
    "studies of breit - wheeler pair production via multiphoton absorption in the strong electromagnetic fields of intense laser waves started in the 1960s @xcite . here ,",
    "the energy threshold for pair production is overcome by the combination of a high - energy @xmath1 photon and several laser photons , according to the reaction @xmath2 due to a remarkable and still ongoing progress in high - power laser technology , there is a clear perspective for corresponding experimental studies in the near future .",
    "petawatt - class laser systems reach field intensities well above 10@xmath3w/@xmath4 in many laboratories worldwide , and an increase towards 10@xmath5w/@xmath4 is envisaged within the extreme light infrastructure ( eli ) @xcite and the exawatt center for extreme light studies ( xcels ) @xcite .",
    "besides , x - ray free - electron laser facilities can generate brilliant kiloelectronvolt photon beams beyond 10@xmath3w/@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "these technological developments have triggered substantial theoretical efforts on @xmath0 pair production and other quantum electrodynamic processes in high - intensity laser fields during the last decade @xcite .",
    "operating modern technologies in a suitable conjunction allows for experimental studies on @xmath0 pair production in strong laser fields already at present .",
    "indeed , the first ( and so far unique ) experimental observation of multiphoton breit - wheeler pair production was accomplished in the 1990s by utilizing ultrarelativistic electron - laser collisions at the stanford linear accelerator center ( slac ) @xcite . in the rest frame of the projectile electrons ,",
    "the laser field strength and frequency were largely amplified to the required level by the relativistic lorentz boost .",
    "the resulting pair creation was attributed to processes involving on average four to five laser photons and a high - energy @xmath1 photon which originated from compton backscattering off the electron beam .",
    "we note that @xmath0 pairs can also be generated when intense laser pulses interact with solid targets @xcite . here , however , the pair production is not caused by multiphoton absorption , but rather by a chain of reactions involving emission of bremsstrahlung and ( bethe - heitler ) pair production in the coulomb fields of atomic nuclei in the target .    while the seminal works @xcite were based on the assumption of an infinitely extended , monochromatic laser wave , in recent years theoreticians have considered refined aspects of laser - induced pair production in more complex field geometries .",
    "two main lines of development may be distinguished .",
    "on the one hand , processes in bichromatic laser fields have been investigated @xcite .",
    "these fields facilitate interferences between pair creation channels of different photon number combinations , which can be modulated by the relative phase shift between the laser modes .",
    "furthermore , suitable combinations of a strong , low - frequency and a weak , high - frequency field mode were shown to enhance the pair creation yield significantly @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in view of the experimental prospects for @xmath0 pair production in strong laser fields , theoretical treatments have started to account for the actual shape of finite laser pulses @xcite .",
    "the broad spectrum of a short pulse was shown to facilitate a multitude of pair creation channels and to strongly modify the created particle spectra . the latter exhibit a quite complicated structure which can also be affected by the carrier - envelope phase ( cep ) of the pulse .",
    "in addition , characteristic enhancements of the pair production probability were found in certain laser parameter regimes .    in this paper ,",
    "@xmath0 pair creation by the multiphoton breit - wheeler process in an intense laser pulse is examined .",
    "laser fields with a moderate value of the normalized vector potential , @xmath6 , will be considered [ see eq .",
    "we shall combine concepts from both theoretical approaches mentioned above in order to show how the energy spectrum of the created particles can be understood in terms of multiphoton processes originating from the continuous pulse spectrum .",
    "the origins of cep effects in the particle spectra shall be classified and essentially traced back to interferences between these channels , which this way can be identified and understood .",
    "our analysis is based on an intuitive model which accounts for the probability of multiphoton events driven by the laser pulse .",
    "it also allows us to identify combined emission - absorption processes of laser photons in the particle spectra .",
    "we note that another simplified model of multiphoton breit - wheeler pair production has been developed in @xcite which , however , conceptually differs from our approach , as will be discussed below .",
    "the present study , moreover , complements a recent article @xcite , where interference processes in a laser field with @xmath7 are interpreted on the basis of a semiclassical model .",
    "we point out that the breit - wheeler process under consideration here is related , by a crossing symmetry of the underlying furry - feynman diagrams , to nonlinear compton scattering . for the latter process , signatures of short laser pulses  including interference and cep effects  have also been studied in recent years ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "besides , it is worth mentioning that interesting analogies of strong - field @xmath0 pair production exist in other areas of physics",
    ". they have been theoretically predicted in various systems , such as graphene layers in external electric fields @xcite or ultracold atoms in optical lattices @xcite , where the dynamics of quasiparticle and hole states can resemble the @xmath0 pair creation .",

    "this behavior follows directly from the fact that emitting instead of absorbing one photon changes the resulting energy by two photon energies .    for the parameters used in fig .",
    "[ fig : em ] , the pair creation process at small energies is clearly not predominantly caused by a one - photon process , but by a two- ( or four- ) photon process , where one ( or two ) of the photons are emitted into the laser wave .",
    "the enormous laser frequency enables even smallest fractions of the central frequency to produce a pair .",

    ", we will investigate the finestructure further and detect cep and interference effects .",
    "in this section , we investigate how the carrier - envelope phase enters the pair creation probability in the multiphoton regime .",
    "the first subsection contains an analytical approach for a general pulse shape , while the second subsection contains numerical examples and shows how our model can be used to identify interference effects .      in the first part ,",
    "we establish a connection between the phase shifts @xmath84 of eq . and the spectral phase of a finite pulse . in the second part",
    ", we will investigate how the pulse spectrum and the spectral phase are affected by the cep .",
    "the third part applies these findings to the pair creation process .",
    "let us regard a plane - wave fronted pulse which is determined by its vector potential @xmath185 .",
    "we regard the fourier decomposition in the form @xmath186 where the spectral phase @xmath187 has been introduced . a comparison with the multichromatic field eq .",
    "shows that the phase shift @xmath84 can be associated with the spectral phase @xmath188 of the corresponding frequency mode .",
    "the latter can equally be expressed by the spectral phase of the electric field @xmath189 , such that we obtain @xmath190 which determines the relevant components in the phase of eq . .",
    "let us assume , for symmetry reasons , the electric field of a plane - wave fronted pulse to be given by @xmath191 with an arbitrary envelope @xmath192 that does not depend on the cep @xmath26 .",
    "the fourier transform has the form @xmath193 revealing the structure of the pulse spectrum and its explicit dependence on the cep .    the cep dependence becomes particularly straightforward , if the first term can be neglected , which requires the following conditions : ( i ) the spectral width of the envelope needs to be small , as for not - too - short pulses ; ( ii ) we restrict ourselves to the most dominant frequency components @xmath148 which are close to the central frequency @xmath169 . under these assumptions ,",
    "the resulting photon density does not depend on the cep , while the spectral phase reveals a linear dependence on the cep .",
    "if one of these conditions is not fulfilled , such as in the high - energy part of the spectrum , the photon density and the spectral phase possess a more complicated cep - dependence .      combining the previous findings",
    ", we can understand the influence of the cep on the pair creation process as seen in the corresponding energy spectra of the particles .    for the following discussion ,",
    "the pulse shape is not specified but assumed to be in accordance with condition ( i ) .",
    "the simplified cep dependence on the pulse spectrum therefore applies for those processes which are mainly induced by photons with frequencies around @xmath169 . for a typical particle energy spectrum",
    ", this condition holds in the interval comprising several multiphoton peaks , starting at energies around @xmath169 ( when emission processes are negligble ) , and extending to the energy at which the one - photon process becomes noticeable again .    in this inner part of the particle spectrum ,",
    "the relevant multiphoton finding probabilities @xmath194 are insensitive to the cep . on the other hand ,",
    "the cep dependence of the spectral phase is conveyed to the phase shifts , which determine the interference phases .",
    "let us further assume the envelope function to be symmetric under time - reversal , such that the complex phase of its fourier transform does not obtain a physically relevant continuous frequency dependence .",
    "thus , for interference terms between ( absorption - only ) processes with @xmath96 and @xmath195 photons , the interference phase obtains a @xmath196 dependence [ cp .",
    "this phase can lead to pronounced interference effects , whose visibility is determined by the probabilities of the underlying channels .- dependence of emission processes , recall eq . .",
    "] we note that our pulse [ cp .",
    "eq . ] as employed in the numerical examples fulfills both criteria .    in the outer part of the particle spectrum , both the multiphoton finding probabilities and the interference phases have more complicated cep dependences .",
    "in this section , we will demonstrate and explain cep effects occuring in the particle energy spectra for our specific choice of the pulse shape [ cp .",
    "eq . ] . to this end , we present numerically computed particle spectra in fig . [",
    "fig : cep ] for various values of the cep @xmath26 while the maximum pulse amplitude @xmath138 is kept constant .",
    "this normalization simplifies the analysis , since , in the spirit of the p - model , the probabilities of the dominant pair production channels are kept constant .",
    "note , however , that the corresponding pulse energy is not constant but depends on @xmath26 .",
    "the pulse amplitude is varied in the panels with @xmath197 ( left ) , @xmath198 ( center ) and @xmath199 ( right ) .",

    "the cep is found to modify the particle spectra locally , while their general structure as determined by the multiphoton peaks and the one - photon tail is preserved . between neighboring multiphoton peaks , quantitatively strong cep effects",
    "are found that can change the pair creation probability by more than one order of magnitude . for a given value of @xmath26 , especially the peak associated with @xmath202 ( as depicted in the inlets )",
    "is modulated by small oscillations with a scale given by the laser basis frequency @xmath15 .",
    "these modulations reveal a strong dependence on @xmath26 .",
    "the one - photon tail exhibits a strong dependence on @xmath26 as well .    in order to understand these effects ,",

    "the pulse shape is chosen in accordance with condition ( i ) from sec .",
    "[ sec : cep_in_pulse_spectrum ] . condition ( ii ) is fulfilled for all processes which are not affected by the high - energy cep - dependence of the photon finding probability @xmath203 .",

    "the distinct cep effects can be attributed to interference effects . at energies in - between multiphoton peaks ,",
    "neighboring photon - number channels are of the same order and can induce strong interference terms , with an interference phase being proportional to @xmath26 .",
    "this effect is the main origin of the cep - dependences which can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cep ] at @xmath207 in all panels , at @xmath208 in the center and right panel and at @xmath209 in the right panel .",
    "the cep dependence was analyzed by means of a fourier decomposition of @xmath210 for fixed values of @xmath124 .",
    "we further note that the cep effects can become more involved when interferences between other photon number channels contribute noticeably to the pair creation probability .",
    "the multiphoton peaks are also subject to interference effects .",
    "the difference between the probabilities of the interfering channels generally decreases as the number of photons is increased ( cp .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) and gives rise to the most prominent interference effects in the peak associated with @xmath202 .",
    "conversely , for a given multiphoton peak , this difference grows with @xmath138 and weakens the interference effects .",
    "the small spectral oscillations disappear simultaneously , leading to the conclusion that they are mainly caused by interferences .",

    "we have not found signatures of self - interferences .",

    "let us deepen the discussion by analyzing the peak associated with @xmath202 . here",
    ", interferences can be expected to happen predominantly between the channels involving @xmath202 photons and the one - photon channel .",
    "the corresponding interference phases have a periodicity of @xmath211 in @xmath26 .",
    "these interferences are the main reason for the @xmath26-dependence of the spectral oscillations as depicted in the inlets of fig .",

    "the moderate @xmath26-dependence of the one - photon channel additionally enhances the pair creation probability for @xmath212 as compared to @xmath213 . for this reason ,",

    "they almost vanish for @xmath215 and @xmath216 . while their original periodicity is @xmath217 , the remaining oscillatory structure has a periodicity of @xmath15 . in the center panel ,",
    "a similar behavior is found , with smallest deviations from the original shape of the multiphoton peak for @xmath212 . in the right panel ,",
    "the corresponding behavior would appear for @xmath218 ( not shown ) .",
    "considering additional properties of the pulse shape under investigation , these observations can be explained .",
    "the pulse spectrum contains strong signatures of the finite temporal length of the pulse .",
    "the fourier transform of the characteristic function is of the form @xmath219 . as a consequence ,",
    "the pulse spectrum contains zeros at integer values of @xmath220 ( except for energies in the main central peak , cp .",
    "[ fig : em ] ) , where the spectral phase jumps by @xmath221 . the particle spectrum and in particular the spectral oscillations",
    "are affected by both effects : while the characteristic zeros determine the energy dependence of the one - photon process , the phase jumps lead to a discrete energy dependence of the interference phases ( see appendix for further details ) .",
    "accordingly , the shape of the spectral oscillations is determined by the one - photon - process and additionally modulated by the energy - dependent interference phase .",
    "the latter is given by @xmath222 where the integer @xmath223 is increased when @xmath124 passes integer multiples of @xmath15 .",
    "when the interference terms vanish due to a specific choice of @xmath26 , the remaining oscillatory structure results from the ( incoherent ) addition of the one - photon process on top of the multiphoton peak .",
    "the one - photon tail lies in the outer part and reveals further cep effects which are mainly determined by the high - energy cep - dependence of @xmath203 .",
    "additionally , they can be caused by interferences involving e.g. the ( weak ) channel with @xmath224 photons .    before proceeding to the conclusion",
    ", we would like to draw a brief comparison between our model and a related model which was presented in @xcite . both approaches",
    "decompose the pair creation process into contributions of different photon numbers .",
    "the model in @xcite applies exactly determined pair production cross sections ( integrated over the emission angles ) in monochromatic fields which are , as an approximation , convoluted with the pulse profile .",
    "contrary to that , in our model an approximation to the pair production probability is used while the emphasize is laid on the spectral properties of the laser pulse .",
    "hence , both models possess a conceptually different structure .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the strong - field breit - wheeler process in short laser pulses with intermediate intensities @xmath6 . employing detailed @xmath11 matrix calculations ,",
    "the energy spectra of emitted particles have been investigated , which exhibit a rich structure .",
    "generalizing concepts from a bichromatic to a multichromatic laser field and regarding the finite laser pulse as a limiting case , our approach is based on the spectral properties of the laser pulse .",
    "this approach enabled us to understand the structure of the energy spectra as well as the effects of the laser carrier - envelope phase .",
    "the carrier - envelope phase was found to have a two - fold impact on the particle spectra .",
    "first , it influences the probabilities of multiphoton process .",
    "second , it directly affects the interference phase between different pair production channels .",
    "the latter effect clearly reflects the analogy to the role of the relative phase shift in a bichromatic field of orthogonal polarization ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the combination of both effects leads to distinct signatures of multiphoton interferences in the particle spectra .",
    "our approach has led to an intuitive model based on the probabilities of multiphoton processes .",
    "the model has supported the analysis of the particle spectra with quantitative estimates for the magnitudes of different production channels , and has additionally allowed to detect combined emission - absorption processes .",
    "it can easily be extended to include high photon numbers and can further be applied to gain insights into other multiphoton qed processes in intense laser pulses as well .",

    "this study has been performed within project b11 of sfb - tr18 funded by the german research foundation ( dfg ) .",
    "in this appendix , we shall give further details on the dependence of the amplitude phase , as briefly described in sec .",

    "let us regard the interference terms in eq . .",
    "the phases @xmath225 are determined by the spectral phases @xmath188 of the participating photons [ cp .",
    "let us further regard processes in the inner part of the particle s energy spectrum as defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : cep_analytical ] , such that the spectral phase of a relevant photon with frequency @xmath226 is given by @xmath227 the integer @xmath228 is zero if @xmath83 is equal ( or close to ) @xmath169 .",
    "it is increased by one whenever @xmath83 passes integer multiples of @xmath15 outside the main spectral peak , which is located within the interval @xmath229 , cp . figs .",
    "[ fig : em ] and [ fig : fig1 ] . the constant in eq .",
    "does neither depend on the frequency @xmath83 nor on @xmath26 .",
    "for a given photon combination @xmath105 , we introduce the total number of sign - changes @xmath230 .",
    "now we can decompose the full interference term in eq . into contributions from certain photon combinations",
    "@xmath231 being sorted by the number of sign - changes @xmath232 . at this point , we can also account for sign - changes induced by @xmath233 [ cp . eq . ] .",
    "since all these sign - changes affect the global sign of a given interference process between two photon combinations @xmath105 and @xmath234 , we end up with the full interference term @xmath235 being divided in two addends : one with a constructive interference , the other one with destructive interference . with @xmath236 being independent of @xmath26 in the inner part of the spectrum , and assuming the same for @xmath233 , both interference terms have an effective interference phase of @xmath237 .",
    "second , for interference processes being affected by the high - energy cep - dependence ( see e.g. the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cep ] ) , the interference phase may be more complicated than @xmath238 .",
    "in fact , when the first term in eq . has to be taken into account , the resulting spectral phase deviates from the linear dependence on @xmath26 .",
    "still , these deviations are found to have only small impact on the appearance of the corresponding @xmath239-term in our numerical computations .",
