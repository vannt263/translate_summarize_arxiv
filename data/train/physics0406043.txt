    "ligand binding at the iron porphyrin active sites of heme proteins are fundamental for oxygen transport and aerobic metabolism @xcite .",
    "many of these reactions involve nonradiative transitions between different spin states and require spin - orbit coupling .",
    "this interaction occurs primarily on the tm atom due to the localized nature of the 3@xmath0 valence electrons and most quantum chemistry codes do not incorporate the small ( @xmath30.05 - 0.1 ev ) energy - scale coupling .",
    "+ in general , treatment of open - shell tm atoms is difficult and many of the standard density - functional theory ( dft ) model chemistries such as the local density or gradient - corrected approximations ( lda and gga , respectively ) are known to give erroneous qualitative results in some cases @xcite . the primary source of these problems are _ non - dynamical correlations _ associated with the near - degeneracy of configurations with the hartree - fock single - slater determinant groundstate @xcite . in fact , it is clear that in the vicinity of the transition state of a charge transfer complex such _ non - dynamical correlations _ may be very important , much as they are in chemical bond breaking .",
    "one may incorporate these effects by higher - order corrections such as moller - plesset perturbation theory ( mp2,mp4 ) or configuration interaction ( ci ) methods such as complete active space self - consistent field ( casscf ) , or , especially for non - dynamical correlations , multireference configuration interaction approaches@xcite , but these methods are computationally prohibitive for tm molecules containing @xmath350 atoms .",
    "in many cases the ci must be limited to single excitations , which may be insufficient@xcite .    while the addition of some amount of non - local exchange used in the hybrid hartree - fock / dft methods such as b3lyp seems to capture some of the multi - determinantal character of tm systems @xcite , the minimal local gaussian basis sets required for quantitative accuracy are very large and",
    "the sampling required for dynamics and the calculation of excited states is not yet affordable for most processors .    in this paper",
    "we introduce an effective semi - empirical model hamiltonian that is well - suited for ( @xmath350 - 100 atoms ) tm molecules .",
    "the problematic aspect of strongly correlated tm systems , the ( @xmath0-@xmath0 coulomb interaction ) , leads to a physically - motivated reduction of the many - body basis set required by limiting the number of @xmath4 configurations that must be considered .",

    "we also include the 3@xmath0 spin - orbit ( s.o . ) in its first - order perturbative form .",
    "the inclusion of the tm s.o . is significant for processes that involve changes in the total spin of the electrons in the 3@xmath0 shell .",
    "given the large changes in reorganization energy that can accompany these processes , we need to couple our model , which deals only with the valence electronic sector , to a relevant reaction coordinate , such as bond length change .",
    "this is especially vital for biomolecules where function is modulated by structural changes @xcite .",
    "the simplest way to couple the tm molecule to the environment is via the terms in eqn.(4 ) : the term @xmath15 provides a ( holstein ) linear coupling of the @xmath0-level charge occupancy of the tm atom and the reaction coordinate , the change in metal - ligand bond distance , @xmath16 . at lowest order , the potential energy surfaces are harmonic and so we can add an energy term that is parabolic in @xmath16 : @xmath17 . the linear coupling and the parabolic energy term",

    "we refer to experimental metal - ligand vibrational data @xcite .",
    "we now show how we apply this model to a particular system , the self - exchange electron - transfer in the cobalt hexaammines , @xmath28 .",
    "we would like to examine how effects arising from strong correlations manifest in the general problem of electron transfer between solvated 1@xmath29-row transition metal ions that are mediated by a ligand bridge .",
    "in particular , we focus on the electron self - exchange rate in the cobalt hexaammine system @xmath28 , which is given by the following reaction : @xmath30 and the reasons why @xmath31 is two orders of magnitude larger than predicted",
    ". experimental measurements of the rate ( @xmath3210@xmath33 - 10@xmath34 m@xmath35s@xmath35 ) @xcite deem the reaction adiabatic , i.e. where the electron transmission coefficient @xmath36 , while previous theoretical efforts ( @xmath3210@xmath37 m@xmath35s@xmath35 ) yield @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "electronic structure effects can be important for et between small tm complexes in solution ( which we define to be the metal ion and the six coordinating ligands of the first solvation shell ) that are in contact with each other . in the case of the hexaammines , the salient feature appears to be a `` spin barrier '' , ( first pointed out by orgel @xcite ) .",
    "during the course of the transfer process , each cobalt ion must change its spin by @xmath39 . strictly speaking ,",
    "@xmath31 should be zero , but various schemes have been proposed to show why the rate is , in fact , almost adiabatic .    the model for the electron - transfer process is usually treated as two cobalt ions ( one co(ii ) valence , the other co(iii ) ) that are each surrounded by their primary solvation shells which consist of six octahedrally - coordinated nh@xmath27 groups .",
    "the et between the co(nh@xmath27)@xmath40 complexes is generally believed to be an outer - sphere process , so the ligands act as a bridge that the tunnelling electron delocalizes over during the reaction .",
    "the redox - active orbitals of the ammine ligands are the highest occupied molecular orbitals ( homos ) of the ammines which have @xmath13 symmetry and hybridize strongly with the cobalt @xmath41 orbitals @xcite .",
    "the strong @xmath13-donating ability of the ammine ligand has been confirmed by nmr studies which observe the kinetic stability of this complex through the rate of water exchange of co(nh@xmath27)@xmath40 .",
    "this rate for co(nh@xmath27)@xmath40 is a factor of @xmath310@xmath42 slower than for co(h@xmath43o)@xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the et reaction can be reduced to a unimolecular process by consideration of the encounter complex , which is formed by the van der waals contact of the two primary coordination shells of the metal ions .",
    "this can be done in a variety of orientations @xcite .",
    "the two most commonly considered are the ( 1 ) apex - to - apex , which involves contact along the @xmath44 axis , and is the most optimal bridge since the 1@xmath45 orbitals of the hydrogen atoms of the two ammines in close - contact show large mixing , and ( 2 ) face - to - face , which has two faces perpendicular to the @xmath46 body - diagonal .",
    "the ammine contact is probably not as good here but there are 6 ammines in contact instead of 2 . for calculation of @xmath31 and @xmath47 ,",
    "some averaging over different orientations should be done to give a more realistic estimates of these quantities .",
    "we do not do that here , only focusing on the most optimal geometry , apex - to - apex . given this fixed geometry , we investigate electronic structure effects .",
    "buhks et al .",
    "@xcite first noted that the groundstate - to - groundstate electron - transfer between the low - spin co(iii ) ion ( 3@xmath48)(@xmath49a@xmath50 ) and the high - spin co(ii ) ion ( 3@xmath51)(@xmath52t@xmath50 ) is spin - forbidden and the reaction must proceed through the @xmath53 @xmath54e excited state for co(ii ) or the @xmath55 @xmath56t@xmath50 and @xmath56t@xmath43 of co(iii ) .",
    "they also showed that there is a non - zero s.o . coupling matrix element between these ground and excited states , so the groundstates are not single - determinant but show small admixture to these excited states .",
    "thermal population of these excited configurations is an open issue @xcite .",
    "the vertical energy separation between @xmath49a@xmath50 and @xmath56t@xmath50 for co(iii ) is very large ( @xmath314,000 cm@xmath35 ) and well - established by experiment . on the other hand ,",
    "the separation between @xmath52t@xmath50 and @xmath54e for co(ii ) has been estimated from semi - empirical indo / ci calculations to be 3000 - 9000 cm@xmath35 @xcite . while the existence of low - spin co(iii ) has been experimentally verified , no such confirmation exists for high - spin co(ii ) .",
    "thus , appreciable population of the @xmath54e may yet be a viable possibility .",
    "also , it should be noted that these values have been estimated for the equilibrium configuration .",
    "the relevant values for the energy separation should be made at the transition state , where they will be significantly reduced .",
    "this discussion is summarized in fig.(1 ) .     and co@xmath58 valences .",
    "these are the relevant electronic states for the self - exchange electron transfer reaction between cobalt atoms in co(nh@xmath27)@xmath40 .",

    "newton obtained a value of 940 cm@xmath35 for the spin - allowed electron transfer .",
    "he then used a reduction factor of 2 x 10@xmath60 to account for the 2@xmath61-order spin - orbit coupling , obtaining a value of 20 cm@xmath35 for the @xmath52t@xmath50 to @xmath49a@xmath50 process which corresponds to a @xmath62 4.0 x 10@xmath63 .",
    "furthermore , newton considered different orientations for the encounter complex , such as apex - to - apex , edge - to - edge , and face - to - face , which will alter hybridization - matrix elements and differ in the number of bridging ligands ( 2 , 4 , 6 , respectively ) .",
    "newton , in a more recent paper @xcite , calculated the relative energies of @xmath52t@xmath50 and @xmath54e electronic configurations of co(ii ) and the @xmath49a@xmath50 , @xmath56t@xmath50 of co(iii ) using unrestricted hartree - fock ( uhf ) and second - order mller - plesset ( ump2 ) .",
    "he recalculated @xmath47 and @xmath64 for the apex - to - apex geometry using these semi - empirical ci methods that take into account electron correlations at the level of 2nd - order brillouin - wigner perturbation theory .",
    "for the groundstate pathway , @xmath52t@xmath50/@xmath49a@xmath65a@xmath50/@xmath52t@xmath50 he obtains a values ( @xmath47 = 9.5 cm@xmath35 , @xmath64 = 1.2 x 10@xmath63 ) which are optimal in the sense that the @xmath66 - nh@xmath27 @xmath13-homo hybridization can only decrease in other geometries .",
    "he estimates the effect of orientational averaging by taking into account a multiplicative factor 0.1 ; @xmath670.1(@xmath68)@xmath69 so @xmath6710@xmath70 , still falling 2 orders of magnitude short of explaining the observed results .",
    "we use the model hamiltonian of eqn.(1 ) , which involves use of an _ ansatz _ for the groundstate wavefunction with the coefficients to be determined variationally .",
    "the wavefunction is composed of the lowest - lying single - determinants in the many - electron hilbert space , where the truncation of the space is dictated by energetics .",
    "our problem therefore reduces to diagonalizing the model hamiltonian in a restricted hilbert space .",
    "we first considered the two nominal valences for each cobalt hexammine reactant . in each case",

    "we briefly want to introduce this code .",
    "nevertheless we want to stress that our way of determining the parameters is quite general and independent of the code one uses as long as it has certain features such as a local atomic basis set and the projected density of states ( pdos ) .",
    "in running siesta we used troullier - martins norm - conserving pseudo potentials @xcite in the kleinman - bylander form @xcite . for cobalt",

    "relativistic effects are included for the core electrons in the usual scalar - relativistic approximation ( mass - velocity and darwin terms ) and by averaging over spin - orbit coupling terms , while no spin - orbit coupling is included for the 4s and 3d valence electrons .",
    "hence spin stays a good quantum number .",
    "siesta uses a local basis set of pseudo atomic orbitals ( pao ) of multiple @xmath80-type .",

    "ab initio _ calculations .    for co(nh@xmath56)@xmath76",
    ", the vertical energy separation @xmath126 is too small ( @xmath30.5 ev ) when compared with experiment ( @xmath31.7 ev ) for the set of parameters .",
    "a parameter that we have some freedom with is the ligand - field splitting 10@xmath119 .",
    "the lack of constraint on 10@xmath119 emerges from the model not taking proper account of all of the contributions to the ligand - field energy splitting .",
    "10@xmath119 is composed of the point - charge ligand - field @xmath103 and a contribution due to the hybridization of the cobalt and ligand orbitals .",
    "while the model does take into account the most important hybridization between the @xmath98 and ammine homo , it _ does not _ actually form bonding / anti - bonding pairs since the 3@xmath0 electron sector of our basis set is represented in the atomic orbital basis , i.e. the @xmath98 levels are just the atomic orbitals , so in the current treatment we can not accurately predict the hybridization contribution .",
    "therefore , we treat the ligand - field splitting as a free - parameter in our model .",
    "while the 10@xmath119 value seems to work well for co(nh@xmath56)@xmath71 it does not reproduce the correct vertical energy separation between low - spin and @xmath55 3@xmath48 , so by increasing it by 1 ev to 3.55 ev , we recover the vertical energy from experiment .",
    "the effect on the weights is to shift @xmath35@xmath127 from @xmath73 - 3@xmath51 to @xmath73 - 3@xmath48 , as would be expected .",
    "we now need to determine if and how the effects of correlation between the @xmath0 electrons manifest in this system . for co(nh@xmath56)@xmath76 , the hole seems nearly fully delocalized between the first coordination sphere of ammines and the cobalt 3@xmath0 shell with 51% in the @xmath73 - 3@xmath48 ( @xmath49a@xmath50 ) configuration and 42% in the @xmath73 - 3@xmath77 states .",
    "this weight is divided up with @xmath37% per state with a hole localized in one of the six nh@xmath27 homo s . at first glance , the physical picture appears to be very much like the screening cloud associated with the kondo effect . in the case of cerium materials ,",
    "the hole left behind from an electron hopping from the conduction band to the 4@xmath128 impurity delocalizes over the entire continuum of conduction states , dynamically screening the local moment and leading to the formation of the singlet bound state .",
    "we can not say if the appreciable hole - weight delocalized over the ligands is due to mixed valence state or not .",
    "both the @xmath73 - 3@xmath48(@xmath49a@xmath50 ) and @xmath73 - 3@xmath51(@xmath54e ) states possess filled diamagnetic @xmath88 shells , so the hund s rule exchange contribution to the @xmath0-@xmath0 coulomb interaction is equal in each case .",
    "since we only have two configurations , we may shift the fermi level to correspond with the @xmath73 - 3@xmath51 , therefore we do not have to refer to @xmath1 . from this perspective ,",
    "the delocalization of the hole between metal 3@xmath0 and the ammine orbital looks simply like the consequence of single - particle covalency .",
    "this interpretation is also consistent with the composition of molecular orbitals from our _ ab initio _ calculations which show nearly equal contributions from metal and ligand orbitals in the ( @xmath98-@xmath13 ) bonding / anti - bonding pair .",
    "however , there does seem to be an analogy between the @xmath48 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 configurations of co(nh@xmath27)@xmath76 and the configurations @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 of the mixed valence rare - earth compounds such as ceo@xmath43 and metallic @xmath132-ce , where mixed valence has been established . in both the transition metal and lanthanide cases these multiple configurations mix into the groundstate because of their near - degeneracy .",
    "in both cases there is also large suppression of the two ligand - hole states due to the hubbard-@xmath133 coulomb repulsion of electrons on the localized impurity levels . in the cerium materials the @xmath134 electron and the ligand hole @xmath135 can form an exciton - like boundstate that preserves the symmetry of the diamagnetic @xmath129 state , i.e. a spin - singlet state with no orbital moment . in co(nh@xmath27)@xmath76 , we would have a similar energy lowering associated with freezing out the 2-fold orbital degeneracy of the @xmath98 shell and the spin - degree of freedom , antiferromagnetically coupled to the hole delocalized over the six nh@xmath27 homo levels .",
    "such a state usually forms if the singly - occupied configuration is slightly lower in energy than the empty level .",
    "this requirement is not satisfied in co(nh@xmath27)@xmath76 since the diamagnetic 3@xmath48 state is stabilized by 1.6 ev with respect to the @xmath73 - 3@xmath51 configuration .",
    "however , the hybridization between the @xmath98 and ammine homo s are large enough ( @xmath32 - 3 ev ) to mitigate this energy gap . in ceo@xmath43 the partial occupancy of the 4@xmath128-level",
    "is observed to be @xmath30.6 , consistent with the lattice volumes that are somewhat shorter than expected for ce@xmath58 compounds . in co(nh@xmath27)@xmath76 , if this type of partial occupancy exists ( @xmath30.5 from our model calculation ) , experimentalists should observe bond lengths that are somewhere intermediate between those expected for co(nh@xmath27)@xmath71 and co(nh@xmath27)@xmath76 .",
    "for co(nh@xmath27)@xmath71 , as stated above , the values for the single - particle co 3@xmath0 and ammine homo energies are such that there is almost complete resonance , and molecular orbitals are constructed with @xmath350% of each type of orbital .",
    "we observe in our calculated result the effect of the large @xmath1 in suppressing the 3@xmath74 weight so the admixture is now on the order of @xmath370@xmath127 of the hole is localized in the @xmath0 shell , while @xmath330@xmath127 is delocalized over the ammine ligands .",
    "this suppression of 3@xmath74 configurations is expected .",
    "the question is what consequence do these effects have on the electron transfer matrix element @xmath47 .",
    "we performed calculations of the groundstates for the single co(nh@xmath27)@xmath71 and co(nh@xmath27)@xmath76 complexes .",
    "we would now like to use the basis sets of both of these complexes to form an encounter complex that represents the reactants in the electron - transfer process .",
    "we connect the single 2+/3 + complexes in the apex - to - apex orientation through a bridge composed of ammines from each molecule , which gives us the hamiltonian @xmath136 both h@xmath50 and h@xmath43 refer to the identical model hamiltonian for each single complex given by eqn.(1 ) .",

    "the hopping integral @xmath139 can be estimated by noting that 2@xmath139 is approximately the energy splitting between the bonding / anti - bonding orbitals formed from the homo of each of the two bridging nh@xmath27 , oriented by close contact of the hydrogen atoms of each ammine .",
    "we must now solve for the groundstate using the appropriate basis set .",
    "we construct this by taking a tensor product of our basis sets for co(nh@xmath27)@xmath71 and co(nh@xmath27)@xmath76 .",
    "the basis set is doubled to account for exchanging co(nh@xmath27)@xmath71 and co(nh@xmath27)@xmath76 in space .",
    "there is then another multiplication by two in order to treat the hermitian matrix in order to use diagonalization routines suited for real , symmetric matrices @xcite .",

    "we have essentially reproduced this calculation from our simpler model .",
    "what the reduction of @xmath152 implies is that the correlation effects we have observed in the single complexes of cobalt hexaammine do not seem to enhance the et rate .",

    "the quantum weight of this state in the groundstate is not increased by the correlation - induced suppresion of 3@xmath74 occupancy .",
    "in fact , this suppression tends to reduce the magnitude of @xmath47 .",
    "the arrows in fig.(2 ) indicate that the 3@xmath74 states of both co(nh@xmath27)@xmath71 and co(nh@xmath27)@xmath76 couple through the bridge term of @xmath161 .",

    "the single - particle hybridizations @xmath162 were extracted directly and the coulomb parameters ( @xmath100,@xmath1,@xmath79 ) were obtained from mapping to a mean - field solution of our model . using these parameters , we found the groundstates of both 2 + and 3 + nominal valences .",
    "for the co(nh@xmath27)@xmath76 state we find strong configurational admixture between the 3@xmath48 and 3@xmath77 states .",
    "the hole @xmath135 is fully delocalized between the cobalt atom and the first coordination sphere of ammines . while this resembles the screening cloud and partial occupancy of the impurity level seen in mixed valent compounds like ceo@xmath43 , the large 3@xmath77 weight could simply be a purely single - particle effect since the delocalization is consistent with the equal metal and ligand orbital composition of molecular orbitals near the fermi level from the dft calculation .",
    "for co(nh@xmath27)@xmath71 there is an obvious signature of the effect of large @xmath1 , with a suppression of @xmath320@xmath127 of the quantum weight on 3@xmath78 states .",
    "we couple the complexes together by a bridging hamiltonian to form the encounter complex and generate a basis set by using the tensor product of the single hexaammine basis states .",

    "the groundstate energy surface is plotted , resolving the two minima of the electron transfer process .",
    "we are able to extract the electronic coupling @xmath47 as the energy lowering at the transition state , relative to the diabatic surfaces .",
    "what we found is that configurational admixture does not enhance @xmath47 and we get a result @xmath34 cm@xmath35 , that is within a factor of 5 of newton s original calculation .",
    "it appears that the disparity of two orders of magnitude in the self - exchange electron transfer rate of co(nh@xmath27)@xmath40 can not be explained on the basis of the electronic structure of a single complex .",
    "one aspect that has been completely ignored in this calculation are solvation effects beyond the first coordination shell . while one would expect , in the gas phase , that the single , symmetric breathing coordinate would be an excellent approximation to the breathing coordinate , solvent effects could significantly change the heigth of the barrier by adding anharmonicity to the potential wells .",
    "this could contribute to the adiabatic nature of the reaction .",
    "another possible source of enhancement for the et rate could be through _ dynamical _ effects .",
    "the dynamical prefactor depends on the details of how the system crosses and recrosses the thermal barrier .",
    "the presence of the low - lying spin - orbit states that are separated from the groundstate by very small ( @xmath31 cm@xmath35 ) energies could give the vibronic wavepacket multiple channels for reaching the other minimum .",
    "this is a possibility that can be explored with our model , which provides fast `` on - the - fly '' sampling of the correct electronic structure .",
    "excited state calculations of the bimetallic tm active site involving open - shell states , coupled by the tm atom spin - orbit interaction , would be very difficult to do with state - of - the - art quantum chemistry codes .",
    "finally , it is possible that the relevant born - oppenheimer surfaces at the transition state are different from those at equilibrium , which we have explored elsewhere within dft theory@xcite . in particular",
    ", an intermediate spin surface appears to be thermally accessible and favorable at the transition state . in that paper",
    "we actually found a rate two orders of magnitude _",
    "faster _ than experiment .",
    "it is interesting to note that within our calculation and newton s ump2 calculationi@xcite the electron correlation effects actually _ reduce _ the transition rate . within our variational state treatment",
    "the reason is clear : coulombic blocking effects eliminate a class of determinants which can facilitate charge transfer",

    "the method proposed in this paper could be applied to other tm systems such as the active sites in metalloproteins .",

    "<S> we present a model intended for rapid sampling of ground and excited state potential energy surfaces for first - row transition metal active sites . </S>",
    "<S> the method is computationally inexpensive and is suited for dynamics simulations where ( 1 ) adiabatic states are required `` on - the - fly '' and ( 2 ) the primary source of the electronic coupling between the diabatic states is the perturbative spin - orbit interaction among the 3@xmath0 electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the model hamiltonian we develop is a variant of the anderson impurity model and achieves efficiency through a physically motivated basis set reduction based on the large value of the @xmath0-@xmath0 coulomb interaction @xmath1 and a l@xmath2nczos matrix diagonalization routine to solve for eigenvalues . </S>",
    "<S> the model parameters are constrained by fits to the partial density of states ( pdos ) obtained from _ ab initio _ density functional theory calculations . for a particular application of our model </S>",
    "<S> we focus on electron - transfer occuring between cobalt ions solvated by ammonium , incorporating configuration interaction between multiplet states for both metal ions . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the capability of the method to efficiently calculate adiabatic potential energy surfaces and the electronic coupling factor we have calculated compares well to previous calculations and experiment . </S>"
