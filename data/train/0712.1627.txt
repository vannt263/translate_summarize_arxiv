    "in the euclidean setting , extension theorems ( or restriction theorems ) address the problem of finding the exponents @xmath0 and @xmath1 such that the estimate @xmath2 holds , where @xmath3 is a hypersurface of @xmath4 and @xmath5 is a surface measure on @xmath3 .",
    "since this problem was introduced by e. m. stein in 1967 , it has been extensively studied .",
    "see , for example , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "a comprehensive survey of this problem is given in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , mockenhaupt and tao ( @xcite ) recently studied extension theorems in the finite field setting for various algebraic varieties @xmath3 .",
    "their work was mostly restricted to cones and paraboloids in vector spaces over finite fields and they point out that the fourier transform of surface measure on spheres is not as easy to compute in the finite field case .",
    "the authors of this paper obtained in @xcite the sharp decay of fourier transform of non - degenerate quadratic surfaces and used it to obtain the tomas - stein exponents for the corresponding extension problems . here and throughout , the tomas - stein exponents are pairs @xmath6 such that the following two inequalities hold : @xmath7 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "however this result seems to be far from the best one we can expect .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to significantly improve the tomas - stein exponents in the specific case when the non - degenerate quadratic surfaces under consideration are spheres in even dimensional vector spaces over finite fields .",
    "we begin by recalling some notation and fourier analytic machinery in the finite field setting .",
    "we denote by @xmath8 a d - dimensional vector space over the finite field , @xmath9 , with @xmath10 elements .",
    "we assume that the characteristic of @xmath9 is greater than two .",
    "in other words , @xmath10 is a power of an odd prime . for each @xmath11",
    "we define the sphere @xmath12 in @xmath13 by the relation @xmath14 where the notation @xmath15 is defined by the relation @xmath16 . in the sense of analysis ,",
    "the @xmath15 is not a norm since it is not real - valued , but it can be a norm in the sense of algebra ( see , for example , @xcite , p.356 ) .",
    "we fix @xmath17 to be a non - trivial additive character of @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath10 is a prime , we may choose @xmath19 and the exact choice of the non - trivial character is independent of the results in this paper .",
    "given a complex - valued function @xmath20 on @xmath13 , @xmath21 we define the fourier transform of @xmath20 by the formula @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the usual dot product of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "similarly , we define the fourier transform of the measure @xmath26 by the relation @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the number of elements in an algebraic variety @xmath3 in @xmath13 , and @xmath5 denotes normalized surface measure on @xmath3 . using the orthogonality relations for non - trivial characters , we obtain the fourier inversion theorem , that is , @xmath29 given complex - valued functions @xmath30 on @xmath13 , the plancherel theorem is given by @xmath31 note that the plancherel theorem says in this context that @xmath32 endow the measure on the `` space '' variables , dx , with the normalized counting measure given by dividing the counting measure by @xmath33 , and the measure on the `` phase '' variables , dm , with the usual counting measure .",
    "then we obtain the following definitions : for @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 and @xmath37 similarly , denote by @xmath38 the maximum value of @xmath20 .      given an algebraic variety @xmath3 in @xmath13 and the surface measure on @xmath3 denoted by @xmath5 , the extension theorem asks us to determine the exponents @xmath0 and @xmath1 such that @xmath39 where @xmath40 is defined by the best constant such that the extension estimate @xmath41 holds for all functions @xmath20 on @xmath3 . recall that @xmath42 denotes the estimate @xmath43 where the constant @xmath44 is independent of @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath45 means that both @xmath42 and @xmath46 hold .",
    "we also recall that @xmath47 is used if @xmath48 for all @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is independent of @xmath10 .    in two dimensions ,",
    "the extension theorems for the parabolas and the circles in @xmath13 were completely solved by the authors in @xcite and the authors in @xcite respectively . in higher dimensions ,",
    "@xmath51 , mockenhaupt and tao ( @xcite ) also obtained the tomas - stein exponents by showing that @xmath52 whenever @xmath53 if @xmath54 , an analog of the euclidean paraboloid .",
    "in particular , when @xmath55 and @xmath56 is not a square in @xmath18 , they improved the @xmath57 index of @xmath58 result from the tomas - stein exponents by showing that @xmath59 .",
    "the main idea for the improvement was the incidence theorem between lines and points in @xmath60 .",
    "however , it could be difficult to improve the tomas - stein exponents in higher dimensions , in part , because it is not easy to get good incidence theorems in higher dimensions . in this paper",
    ", we discuss this issue by studying the extension theorem for spheres in vector spaces over finite fields . in higher even dimensions ,",
    "@xmath61 , we give the @xmath62 index improvement of the tomas - stein exponents @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",
    "moreover , we show that in higher odd dimensions , @xmath65 it is impossible to improve the @xmath57 index of the tomas - stein exponents @xmath66    our main result is the following .    [ mainthm ]",
    "let @xmath12 be a sphere in @xmath13 defined as in ( [ defofsphere ] ) .",

    ", we may identify the non - degenerate quadratic surface in @xmath13 with the set of the form @xmath69 where all @xmath70 are not zero in @xmath18 . using the same argument as in the proof of theorem [ mainthm ] , we can also obtain the same result as theorem [ mainthm ] in the case when the sphere is replaced by the set @xmath71 above . thus theorem [ mainthm ] can be extended to the extension theorems for non - degenerate quadratic surfaces in @xmath13 .",
    "let us visualize the results of theorem [ mainthm ] ( see figure [ figure1 ] below ) . from hlder s inequality and the nesting properties of @xmath72-norms",
    ", we see that @xmath73 and @xmath74 in particular , ( [ smallgood ] ) implies that our result @xmath75 in theorem [ mainthm ] improves the tomas - stein exponent @xmath76 , because the number @xmath77 is less than @xmath78 in addition , note that @xmath79 which is the trivial estimate . using these facts and interpolation theorems",

    ", we shall establish the estimates related to dot products determined by a subset of sphere @xmath12 , which can be used to obtain the key estimate for the proof of theorem [ mainthm ] . in section 5 , we complete the proof of theorem [ mainthm ] by giving the proof of theorem [ long ] .",
    "in the last section , we shall study the necessary conditions for @xmath39 related to spheres . as a result",
    ", we shall see that , in odd dimensions , @xmath51 , one can not expect the @xmath57 index improvement of tomas - stein exponents @xmath39 for each @xmath81 without any restrictions .",
    "in this section , we introduce the consequences driven by using classical bounds for exponential sums , such as gauss sums and generalized kloosterman sums . in the remainder of this paper , we identify sets with their characteristic functions . for instance , we write @xmath82 and @xmath83 for @xmath84 and @xmath85 respectively .",
    "we also assume that @xmath86 denotes the non - trivial additive character of @xmath9 , and we denote by @xmath87 a multiplicative character of @xmath88 of order two , that is , @xmath89 and @xmath90 for all @xmath91 .",
