    "the structure of such sets has attracted much attention in the mathematics and physics literature .",
    "model sets , which satisfy @xmath12 , have been introduced by meyer @xcite in the context of number theory and harmonic analysis .",
    "after the discovery of quasicrystal alloys , model sets as a mathematical abstraction of these structures have been advertised and developed by moody , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we also mention the recent comprehensive monograph by baake and grimm @xcite .",
    "the name _ weak model set _ was coined by moody @xcite .",
    "in fact weak model sets have been initially studied by schreiber @xcite , see also @xcite for background .    for a given cut - and - project scheme @xmath13 with window @xmath6 ,",
    "the torus @xmath14 associated with the lattice @xmath11 may be used to parametrise model sets arising from translations in @xmath0 and shifts of the window .",
    "this is named the _ torus parametrisation _ in @xcite , which was also studied in @xcite .",
    "for weighted model sets with continuous compactly supported weight functions , it was investigated in @xcite .",
    "some results about the torus parametrisation of general weak model sets appear in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider weak model sets with compact windows , along with their associated dynamical systems , also called their hulls .",
    "the hull is the vague translation orbit closure of the weak model set , if one identifies the point set with a measure which puts unit mass to every point .",
    "in contrast to previous approaches , we will study hulls in the space @xmath15 of locally finite measures on @xmath16 instead of @xmath0 and in an even larger space , namely on the graph of the torus parametrisation , which takes values in @xmath17 .",
    "this highlights connections with the dynamics of skew - product dynamical systems with monotone fibre maps , because the latter system is of this type .",
    "our approach simplifies many arguments and makes the origin of certain standard assumptions on model sets more transparent , which only enter when projecting from @xmath16 to @xmath0 .",
    "extensions to relatively compact windows are discussed as well .",
    "a central result in the theory of model sets with topologically regular windows is almost automorphy of their hull , if the window boundaries have empty intersection with the projected lattice , see robinson @xcite and also @xcite .",
    "we give an alternative proof of this result by our abstract dynamical systems approach .",
    "we will however not investigate in this paper how almost automorphy characterises certain classes of model sets , compare ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm .  3.16 ) .",
    "on the measure theoretic side , a central result by schlottmann  @xcite relates to so - called regular model sets .",
    "these are weak model sets whose window boundaries have vanishing haar measure .",
    "schlottmann s result expresses that the hull of a regular model set has pure point dynamical spectrum .",
    "this , in turn , implies that any regular model set has pure point diffraction spectrum @xcite .",
    "a generalisation for weak model sets was obtained by moody @xcite .",
    "his result , when restricted to weak model sets with compact window , states that `` almost all '' weak model sets have pure point diffraction spectrum and so - called maximal density .",
    "the importance of weak model sets of maximal density was realised recently by strungaru @xcite , who argued that such model sets have pure point diffraction spectrum . within our setup",
    ", we can prove that the hull of any weak model set of maximal density , equipped with the push forward of the torus haar measure by the torus parametrisation , has pure point dynamical spectrum .",
    "our arguments follow from structural assumptions on the torus parametrisation and from a careful revision of moody s arguments .",
    "they crucially rely on dynamical properties of weak model sets of maximal density .",
    "this will be compared to the recent work by baake , huck and strungaru @xcite , who obtain similar dynamical results for weak model sets with a non - empty relatively compact window , which are of maximal or minimal density .",
    "their approach is approximation with regular model sets .",
    "there are many examples of point sets in @xmath0 that have a - sometimes hidden - description as weak model set , see e.g.  the monograph @xcite .",
    "we do not consider here the important question of reconstructing the internal space , the lattice and the window from the point set , but refer to the results meyer ( * ? ? ?",

    "compare the approach by baake and moody @xcite , which is based on the autocorrelation of the point set , and which has recently been revisited by strungaru @xcite .",
    "in fact certain such weak model sets of maximal density have recently attracted attention due to their intimate connection with the mbius function from number theory .",
    "these are the @xmath18-free lattice points and , more generally , the @xmath19-free systems , see @xcite and references therein . for the visible lattice points ,",
    "pure point diffraction spectrum was shown already in @xcite .",
    "pure point dynamical spectrum for the hull of the square - free integers was shown only recently in @xcite without referring to weak model sets , and in @xcite using weak model sets .",
    "whereas these results were obtained by explicit calculation , pure point dynamical spectrum follows from structural arguments within our approach .",
    "this indicates that one may take advantage of the underlying weak model set structure in order to further analyse the simplex of invariant probability measures for these systems .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is the systematic use of the dynamical system that arises from the graph of the torus parametrisation @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the configuration on @xmath16 defined by the window @xmath6 and the lattice @xmath11 shifted by @xmath22 .",

    "we thus obtain @xmath947     + for any given point @xmath76 and any nonempty finite set @xmath948 , let @xmath949 and @xmath950 .",
    "then , for any @xmath415 , @xmath951 as @xmath952 , we thus have @xmath953 `` @xmath954 '' suppose that @xmath284 .",
    "define @xmath955 as in ( [ eq : o - def ] ) .",
    "as @xmath956 is open and as @xmath957 by definition of this set , we have @xmath958 , which implies in view of ( [ eq : revised-1 ] ) and ( [ eq : revised-3 ] ) that @xmath959 `` @xmath960 '' suppose that @xmath280 .",
    "then there is an open neighbourhood @xmath961 of @xmath21 such that @xmath962 .",
    "there are finite disjoint sets @xmath928 , not both empty , such that the open set @xmath955 is contained in @xmath963 , with @xmath964 and @xmath965 a sufficiently small open zero neighborhood , compare ( [ eq : o - def ] ) .",
    "hence , in view of ( [ eq : revised-1 ] ) and ( [ eq : revised-3 ] ) , @xmath966",
    "[ [ the - topological - theory ] ] the topological theory + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    theorem  [ theo : projection - top ] shows that the notion of a maximal equicontinuous factor is of no help for studying the system @xmath173 , when @xmath967 , the interior of the window , is empty , because then this factor is trivial .",
    "this holds , a fortiori , for the system @xmath175 which is a factor of @xmath173 . on the other hand , in view of proposition  [ prop : projection - homeo ] , the system @xmath127 has always the maximal equicontinuous factor @xmath126 , and in view of lemma  [ lemma : proj - homeo-1 ] the same is true for the system @xmath177 .",
    "this means that , if we want to study more general transitive subsystems @xmath968 of @xmath969 , where @xmath72 denotes the space of all locally finite measures on @xmath0 endowed with the topology of vague convergence , one should look for a way to extend @xmath968 ( which generalises @xmath175 ) in a natural way to a system that plays the role of @xmath177 ( and hence has a maximal equicontinuous factor ) . a hint how to accomplish this is given in the proof of theorem  [ theo : projection - top]b .",
    "it is shown there that @xmath737 is a nontrivial joining between these two systems , except if @xmath176 .",
    "so one might attempt to look for maximal equicontinuous systems that can be joined in a nontrivial and non - redundant way to a general transitive system @xmath968 . by _ non - redundant _ we mean that the joining is such that for a dense @xmath149-set of points in @xmath970 the @xmath971-section of the joining consists of just one point and that the joining itself is the closure of the set of all these points .",
    "observe that the joining @xmath972 does have this property , because the zero - measure , if it belongs to @xmath87 , is the only element in @xmath87 that is joined to more than one point in @xmath14 and @xmath973 is dense in @xmath89 .",
    "an equivalent but more appealing way to approach this problem would be to investigate existence and properties of a _ generic maximal equicontinuous factor _ of @xmath968 ( see @xcite for the notion of generic factors ) .",
    "systems @xmath968 generated by relatively compact but non - compact windows might be first candidates to test such ideas .",
    "if @xmath74 is an @xmath103-invariant probability measure on @xmath89 , then the system @xmath974 has the structure of a fibred random dynamical system over the base @xmath192 with fibres which are subsets of copies of @xmath975 .",
    "this sets the scene to study entropy properties of such systems along the lines developed e.g.  in @xcite , and @xcite can be the starting point for a thermodynamic formalism - at least when @xmath437 .",
    "recent results on @xmath976-free systems such as @xcite might provide a good testing ground for such ideas .",
    "our analysis carries over to the non - abelian case , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch .  7 ) for the basic setting .",
    "concerning topological results , note that the compact minimal left coset dynamical system @xmath126 might no longer be equicontinuous , but remains distal .",
    "we can then still consider the graph dynamical system @xmath977 , and the results of sections  [ sec : in ] , [ subsec : top - reg - wind ] and section  [ sec : top ] remain true , the latter with `` equicontinuous '' replaced by `` distal '' .",
    "for measure theoretic results , note that the left invariant quotient measure @xmath978 on @xmath14 remains unique up to normalisation ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.4 ) . hence @xmath14 together with its natural left action is strictly ergodic .",
    "( this is true without cocompactness of the discrete group @xmath11 . )",
    "thus theorem  [ theo : projection - mth ] still holds  up to the spectral statement in part a ) .",
    "also theorems [ theo : moody ] , [ theo : moody - extension ] , [ theo : moody - topogical ] remain true with minor adjustments , compare the proof of theorem  [ theo : moody - extension ] .",
    "this implies that the entropy estimate for weak model sets @xcite , together with its proof , continues to hold in that case .",
    "note however that the latter results rely on the existence of a van hove sequence , see @xcite for a discussion of this strong form of amenability in the non - abelian setting .    in the recent work @xcite",
    ", schlottmann s approach to the torus parametrisation @xcite is revisited for non - abelian regular model sets , with a measure theoretic focus . then diffraction theory is developed in a very general setting , which does not assume amenability nor cocompactness . in the cocompact case , a pure point diffraction result is obtained for groups @xmath0 admitting a gelfand pair .",
    "it might be interesting to further explore the relation between suitable types of dynamical and diffraction spectrum for model sets , thereby extending the pure point result of the abelian case as in @xcite .",
