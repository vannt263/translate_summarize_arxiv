    "radio jets from an x - ray binary were first discovered from ss433 by spencer @xcite and subsequently mapped by hjellming & johnston @xcite with the vla .",
    "the jets had earlier been predicted on the basis of doppler - shifting emission lines ( e.g. @xcite ) .    over the past fifteen years",
    "the class of radio - jet x - ray binaries ( rjxrb ) has expanded slowly to include approximately eight sources for which there is direct observational evidence of jet formation .",
    "these systems , in approximate order of jet discovery , are :    * cyg x-3 , for which an expansion velocity of @xmath0c has been repeatedly measured during outbursts ( e.g. @xcite ) but in which no observations have to date been able to resolve the motion of individual plasmons . * 1e1740.7 - 2942 & grs 1758 - 258 , which while not definitely established as x - ray binaries , are bright hard x - ray sources near the galactic centre with spectacular arcmin - scale radio jets @xcite .",
    "* lsi+61@xmath1 303 , a periodic radio flaring source with measured expansion following outburst @xcite . *",
    "cir x-1 , another periodic flaring source which is embedded in a synchrotron structure with associated radio jets @xcite .",
    "* grs 1915 + 105 , a spectacular x - ray and radio transient which mapping with vla has revealed to possess relativistic jets with apparent superluminal motion , implying true velocities of @xmath2c @xcite . *",
    "gro j1655 - 40 , a second superluminal x - ray transient , with @xmath3c jets resolved by southern hemisphere vlbi @xcite and the vla @xcite .    only ss 433 and the two superluminal transients indisputably possess collimated outflows , while 1e 1740.7 - 2942 & grs 1758 - 258 are not actually established as binary systems ( the binarity of grs 1915 + 105 has not been definitively established but seems highly likely )  in our opinion the order of reality of the rjxrb classification ( with the first three beyond doubt ) is : ss 433 , grs 1915 + 105 , gro j1655 - 40 , cyg x-3 , cir x-1 , lsi+61@xmath1 303 , 1e 1740.7 - 2942 & grs 1758 - 258 .",
    "we do not include in the list the sources gt 2318 + 620 @xcite and gx 1 + 4 @xcite for which rjxrb status has been claimed but the evidence is at present uncertain .",
    "table 1 summarises the overall properties of the rjxrbs . in the following sections we review the observational properties of these sources , looking for any common properties which might link them .",

    "however , while the brightness and flux variations of the source may not be very dramatic , it does possess spectacular x - ray jets from which up to 10% of the soft x - ray emission of the source may arise , which appear to confirm the connection with the surrounding snr w50 and place a lower limit on the lifetime of the jet phenomenon of several 1000 yr @xcite .",
    "grs 1915 + 105 & gro j1655 - 40 share many similar x - ray properties as bright transient sources . both tend to rise from obscurity to amongst the most luminous x - ray sources in the galaxy on short timescales ( see fig 2 for a nice example of gro j1655 - 40 ` switching on ' ) .",
    "asca x - ray spectra of both sources also reveal iron absorption features in the range 6  8 kev @xcite .",

    "both soft and hard x - rays are modulated at the 4.8 h period , _ in phase _ with the infrared modulation @xcite .",
    "x - ray spectra of the source reveal a host of emission features , some of which modulate in strength and width in _ antiphase _ with the continuum @xcite , and which require a nebular origin for much of the x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "rosat observations have revealed a dust scattering halo around cyg x-3 @xcite , and a larger x - ray scattering structure may also exist @xcite .",
    "cir x-1 is another persistent bright source , displaying type i bursts , qpo and movement in the x - ray colour - colour diagram characteristic of an ` atoll ' low - mass xrb ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the unusual x - ray behaviour of cir x-1 has been theorised by oosterbrook et al @xcite to arise as a result of near - supercritical accretion onto a _ low magnetic field _",

    "lsi+61@xmath1 303 , like ss 433 , is a weak x - ray source by comparison with the other x - ray binaries , with a luminosity of @xmath8 erg s@xmath7 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray flaring once per 26.5 d orbit is interpreted as being due to supercritical accretion during periastron passage of the compact object .",
    "high time resolution observations reveal no evidence for x - ray pulsations in the system @xcite .",
    "1e 1740.7 - 2942 & grs 1758 - 258 are relatively weak soft x - ray sources but dominate the galactic centre region at energies above several hundred kev @xcite .",
    "1e 1740.7 - 2942 is in fact the hardest x - ray source within 1@xmath1 of the galactic centre and may be associated with 511 kev e@xmath9e@xmath10 emission , hence its popular name ` the great annihilator ' .",
    "the 2 - 500 kev spectrum of 1e 1740.7 - 2942 is very similar to that of the black hole candidate cyg x-1 @xcite .",
    "lack of space precludes an in - depth discussion of the nature and observational properties of the rjxrbs .",
    "while the ` class ' contains a highly varied and seemingly disparate group of systems , it should be borne in mind that it may only be the environment in the _ inner region of the accretion disc _ which allows / forces the formation of a radio - jet , and that jet formation may be to a large extent independent of the properties of the individual components of the binary .",
    "we choose to briefly highlight three properties which may be common to ( are at least _ consistent with _ ) all the rjxrb :    * presence of an accretion disc during jet formation : long required by many theoretical models , much of the spectroscopic and photometric evidence is consistent with this scenario . * correlated radio  x - ray behaviour : in all sources there seems to be at least some degree of radio  x - ray correlation , though properties such as lags between flaring in the two regimes do vary . * low magnetic field compact object : many of the rjxrb are convincing black - hole candidates , illustrating that the compact object does not supply the magnetic field required for the synchrotron emission ( it most likely originating in material in the accretion disc ) .",
    "the only source for which there is direct evidence of a neutron star is cir x-1 , a source in which the unusual x - ray properties have been modelled as arising from a high rate of accretion onto a _ low magnetic field _ neutron star . combined with a lack of detected radio emission from _ any _",
    "x - ray pulsar , the implication is that a strong compact object magnetic field inhibits jet formation , possibly by preventing formation of a stable inner accretion disc region .",
    "we have presented a review of the observational properties of the eight sources we consider to be radio - jet x - ray binaries .",
    "we note that while the sources vary widely in systems parameters , all data is consistent with the formation of an accretion disc during jet formation ( at least ) , some degree of correlated radio ",
    "x - ray behaviour , and a low or non - existent ( i.e. black hole ) compact object magnetic field .",
    "we would like to thank the nrl - gbi and asm / rxte teams for providing a wealth of superb data to the astronomical community .",
    "we would also like to thank all the people at the jodrell bank workshop , plus dick hunstead , carole haswell , george nicholson and many others for useful discussions ."
