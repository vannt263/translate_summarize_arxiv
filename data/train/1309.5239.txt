    "only a handful of central stars of planetary nebulae ( cspn ) have been shown to be binaries in which the dominant component at optical wavelengths is a sub - giant or giant star enriched in carbon and slow neutron capture process ( s - process ) elements ( bond , ciardullo & meakes 1993 ; thvenin & jasniewicz 1997 ; bond , pollacco & webbink 2003 ; miszalski et al .",
    "2012 ; siegel et al .",
    "these binary cspn are the progenitors of barium stars whose standard formation scenario ( bidelman & keenan 1951 ) involves the companion accreting a carbon and s - process enhanced wind ( boffin & jorissen 1988 ) from the pre - wd progenitor when it experiences thermal pulses during its asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase ( busso et al . 1999 ; herwig 2005 ) .",
    "those barium stars with the shortest orbital periods may also have experienced mass transfer via roche - lobe overflow ( e.g. han et al . 1995 ) or wind roche - lobe overflow ( e.g. mohamed & podsiadlowski 2007 , 2011 ; abate et al . 2013 ) .",
    "mcclure , fletcher & nemec ( 1980 ) found all barium stars to have wd companions , however directly observing them is difficult against the glare of the typically luminous giant secondary even at ultraviolet ( uv ) wavelengths .",
    "recent direct uv detections include the wd companions of main - sequence barium stars ( gray et al .",
    "2011 ) and the evolved pre - wd components of barium cspn ( miszalski et al . 2012 ; siegel et al .",
    "there is now no doubt that barium stars form via binary interactions , although the real challenge at present lies in reproducing the orbital parameters ( period and eccentricity ) using population synthesis models ( e.g. izzard et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "most barium cspn will have orbital periods of several hundred days or longer , in line with other barium stars ( jorissen et al .",
    "1998 ) , but none have yet been measured for the small sample known .",
    "an orbital period of 1.16 d was , however , measured in the post - common - envelope nucleus of pn g054.2@xmath003.4 ( the necklace , corradi et al .",
    "2011 ) , notable for its unique carbon dwarf secondary ( c / o@xmath81 ; miszalski , boffin & corradi 2013 ) . in this case",
    "the mass transfer process may have also produced an accretion disk from which the observed collimated outflows or jets were launched .",
    "the short time spent during the pn phase ( @xmath9 years ) makes barium cspn a potentially very powerful platform for studying agb nucleosynthesis in that we simultaneously see both the polluted s - process rich cool star and the nebula ejected by the polluting star . in recent years",
    "nebular s - process abundance measurements have also become possible ( e.g. sterling & dinerstein 2008 ) .",
    "when combined with traditional nebular abundance analysis , they too will allow for new insights into agb nucleosynthesis models ( karakas & lugaro 2010 ) .",
    "sterling & dinerstein ( 2008 ) and karakas et al . ( 2009 ) found a tendency for type i pne ( peimbert & torres - peimbert 1983 ; kingsburgh & barlow 1994 ) , i.e. those pne that show high n / o and he / h abundance ratios traditionally thought to originate from intermediate - mass agb stars ( @xmath10 @xmath6 , kingsburgh & barlow 1994 ) , to be less s - process enhanced than non - type i pne .",
    "barium cspn offer a complementary or even preferred platform for this work , with stellar abundance analysis of the cool star potentially providing both low and high s - process elements ( e.g. abia et al . 2002 ) and a direct measurement of the metallicity via [ fe / h ] rather than potentially problematic nebular metallicity indicators ( e.g. [ o / h ] , see karakas et al .",
    "it is therefore essential to find new examples of these rare objects to realise their unique capabilities .    as part of an ongoing campaign to study relatively faint cspn with 810 m class telescopes",
    "we have continued with the strategy outlined in miszalski et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , namely to identify similar binaries by selecting for near - infrared ( nir ) colours that suggest the presence of a cool star .",
    "one object that stood out in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 colour - colour space of the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) was the previously unstudied central star of hen  2 - 39 ( pn g283.8@xmath004.2 , henize 1967 ) .",

    "wavelength calibration of arc lamp exposures was performed using standard iraf tasks identify , reidentify , fitcoords and transform by identfying the arc lines in each row and applying a geometric transformation to the data frames .",

    "sec : neb ] ) .",
    "this cleaned nebular spectrum was also rescaled and then subtracted from the cspn spectrum to isolate the cspn spectrum with only large subtraction residuals on the brightest lines ( that were also interpolated over ) .",

    "< , < \" , ]     so can we explain the hen  2 - 39 pollution by such models and realistic mass transfer ?",
    "the pollution level in hen  2 - 39 is [ c / h]=0.42 , and [ ba / fe]=1.5 . to achieve this level of enrichment we require [ c / h ] 2.6 times higher than in the original ( solar ) material of the star , and a [ ba / fe ] enrichment of a factor 30 .",
    "initially , we have a red giant with solar composition and envelope mass @xmath18 which accretes @xmath19 from its agb companion .",
    "the latter is enriched in carbon over solar abundance by a factor @xmath20 and in barium by a factor @xmath21 .",
    "this material is then diluted into the red giant envelope whose final mass is @xmath22 and the final overabundance is @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "this gives    @xmath25 which can be rearranged as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is c or ba and @xmath28 is the amount of enrichment of @xmath27 required .",
    "taking the 1.8 m@xmath29 model , where at the final tp carbon is increased by 0.77 dex , i.e. @xmath30 = 5.89 , we would therefore need to have @xmath31 . in order to reproduce the observed value of @xmath32 , such a value of @xmath28",
    "would then impose @xmath33 @xmath790 .",
    "this is easily reproduced by the final amount of barium produced by the 1.8 m@xmath29 model with a pocket size of @xmath34 m@xmath29 .    if we were to take the 3.0 m@xmath29 model with a pocket size of @xmath35 m@xmath29 instead",
    ", its identical level of carbon enrichment implies the same value of @xmath28 as the 1.8 m@xmath29 model .",
    "therefore , to reproduce the observed @xmath24 we would also require @xmath33 @xmath790 , however the 3.0 m@xmath29 model only produces about half this amount .",
    "this significant difference demonstrates that reproducing hen  2 - 39 would be more straightforward with lower mass agb models .",
    "we have made experiments following binary systems of various masses using the binary star evolution code ( hurley , tout & pols 2002 ) .",
    "if the agb star mass is assumed to be in the 1.82.0 m@xmath29 range , then we conclude that the present red giant must have had an initial mass which is smaller by about 20% that of the initial mass of the agb star , after having accreted some material from its companion , in order for it to currently be a red giant .",
    "so we assume @xmath36 m@xmath29 .",
    "such a star has a convective envelope of about 1.0 m@xmath29 , so this means that it must have accreted @xmath28 times 1.0 @xmath6 = 0.48 @xmath6 from the agb during the last phase .",
    "this is an upper limit , as the agb star lost smaller amounts of mass prior to the last tp that were also enriched to a lesser degree in c and s - process elements , and the giant was thus already partially contaminated . as the agb star lost 0.49 m@xmath29 during the last tp according to the model , it is thus possible for the giant to have accreted 0.48 m@xmath29 , provided the mass transfer was quasi - conservative .",
    "such a quasi - conservative mass transfer could be the result of stable rlof if the primary fills its roche lobe just at the tip of the agb phase and during the last tp , such that all the remaining mass of the agb star is transferred onto the companion .",
    "alternatively , in the case where no formal rlof happened , wind rlof , which is also thought to be quasi - conservative , could be sufficient ( mohamed & podsiadlowski 2007 , 2011 ) .",
    "further detailed simulations are required to address the full history of this interesting system . the 1.8 @xmath6 model or one similar to it with a large pocket size is therefore a reasonable explanation for the progenitor of the pre - wd component likely present in hen  2 - 39 .    although we have shown above that a 3.0 m@xmath29 agb star would have more difficulty to reproduce the level of barium enhancement observed in hen  2 - 39 , we have also looked at the mass transfer expected from such a massive agb star . here , again , we would need to have an accreting companion with a final mass close to 3.0 m@xmath29 to be now seen as a red giant while the former agb star is going through the pn phase .",
    "the limit seems to be @xmath37 m@xmath29 , which we adopt in the following .",
    "this mass is the result of accreting @xmath19 to an existing @xmath38 star , where as shown above , we need @xmath39 .",
    "as the mass of the envelope of the accretor can be assumed to be , roughly , @xmath40 , we are thus led to @xmath41 , or @xmath42 .",
    "the companion has then accreted about 0.8 m@xmath29 of the material produced by the agb star during the last tp . as a 3.0 m@xmath29 agb star looses 0.9 m@xmath29 during this last tp  and will still loose as much material before finishing up as a wd  there is again , in principle , plenty of material to accrete from to explain the final pollution .",
    "the level of pollution experienced by the agb star in hen  2 - 39 is consistent with the abundances observed in the polluted giant companion , although we do not claim this is a unique or final solution . a detailed study of the evolution of the binary system , whose orbital period and mass function is currently unknown , is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the abundance analysis results for hen  2 - 39 may be compared to those obtained in a similar fashion for a  70 ( miszalski et al . 2012 ) .",
    "there are no published nebular abundances for other pne with barium cspne , a difficult task given their low nebular surface brightnesses . despite the very small sample of two , we can see where each fits in the nebular s - process studies of sterling & dinerstein ( 2008 ) and karakas et al .",
    "the [ ba / fe ] estimates for the type - i pn a  70 of @xmath70.5 dex and the non - type i pn hen  2 - 39 of 1.50@xmath430.25 dex are consistent with the trend found in these studies , namely that type - i pne are s - process poor .",
    "an additional object that could be considered , but does not seem to fit the trend , is me  1 - 1 which appears to be a non - type i bipolar pn ( shen , liu & danziger 2004 ) with a k12 bright giant that is not s - process enhanced ( [ ba / fe]=0.0 dex , pereira et al .",
    "2008 ) .    with a larger sample it may be possible to meaningfully address the enigma surrounding type - i pne . while it may be that some type - i pne are be formed from single intermediate mass agb stars , stars with m@xmath444.5 @xmath6 required for hot bottom burning at solar metallicities ( karakas 2010 ) are short - lived and rare according to the initial mass function . some may be formed via rapidly rotating stars of @xmath72.53.0 m@xmath29 ( e.g. lagarde et al . 2012 ) , in which case their tendency for low s - process enhancement may be explained by rotation suppressing the s - process ( herwig et al . 2003 ) .",
    "this may help explain the type - i abundances of a  70 at the large height of @xmath72 kpc below the galactic disk ( miszalski et al .",
    "binary stellar evolution provides one pathway to inducing rapid rotation via accretion , as observed in barium cspne , but there may be many other possibilities in binaries given the large parameter space of binary evolution .    without uv spectroscopy we are limited to a nebular carbon abundance that is enhanced 0.79 dex relative to solar .",
    "further uv observations are therefore needed to say whether the stellar [ c / h]=0.42@xmath430.02 dex enhancement matches that seen in the nebula .",
    "we have presented evidence that reveal a barium central star binary in hen  2 - 39 , only the fourth known bona - fide case of a barium star surrounded by a pn .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    * the observed nucleus of hen  2 - 39 is a @xmath45 mag red giant with a cool atmosphere @xmath2 k with enhanced carbon ( [ c / h]=@xmath3 dex ) and the s - process element barium ( [ ba / fe]=@xmath4 dex ) .",
    "a spectral class of c - r3 c@xmath54 was determined according to the barnbaum et al .",
    "( 1996 ) carbon star atlas and no lithium @xmath466707.83 was detected . as observed in other barium cspne , low - amplitude photometric variability with a possible period of 5.46",
    "d was detected , most likely due to a fast rotation period caused by spin - up after mass accretion .",
    "this is also supported by the detection of weak chromospheric ca  ii k emission . * an agb star model with an initial mass of 1.8",
    "@xmath6 and a relatively large carbon pocket size of @xmath34 @xmath6 produced sufficient amounts of carbon and barium that could plausibly produce the observed properties of hen  2 - 39 .",
    "the larger mass 3.0 @xmath6 model may also work , however this may be easily hampered by the greater degree of dilution of s - process material into the larger stellar envelope .",
    "nevertheless , a lower mass agb star offers a more straightforward solution to the problem .",
    "more detailed modelling is certainly warranted when the critical parameters of orbital period and mass function are measured .",
    "* the nucleus shares many properties with early r - type carbon stars , whose origin is poorly understood and may involve a binary merger , the s - process enhancement and highly probable binary nature of hen  2 - 39 suggest it may just be a barium star overlapping the parameter space of these peculiar stars . *",
    "the nebula shows an apparent ring - like morphology as also seen in the other pne with barium cspne , webo  1 and a  70 .",
    "a distance estimate of 5.7 kpc was made based on the nebular properties . at this distance",
    "the @xmath47 kk pre - wd ionizing source of the nebula has an estimated luminosity of @xmath48 @xmath49 .",
    "future uv observations are expected to reveal this component as already proven for a  70 ( miszalski et al . 2012 ) and webo  1 ( siegel et al . 2012 ) . *",
    "the nebular abundance pattern of hen  2 - 39 is close to that of the sun and the average non - type i pn .",
    "while hen  2 - 39 is not a type - i pn but is s - process rich , a  70 is a type - i pn but less s - process rich ) .",
