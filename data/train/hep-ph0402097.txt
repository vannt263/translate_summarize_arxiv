    "recent years have seen a large amount of new experimental information on the phenomena of @xmath3 violation , one of the least well understood aspects of the standard model of particle physics .",
    "the observation of mixing - induced @xmath3 violation in decays  @xcite and the observation of direct @xmath3 violation in the neutral kaon system  @xcite are both in agreement with the predictions of the kobayashi - maskawa theory  @xcite .",
    "the km mechanism is thus established as an effective and elegant description of the weak interactions of the standard model quarks .",
    "nonetheless , it would be premature to claim that @xmath3 violation is understood .",
    "internationally , a large number of experiments , at various stages from planning to running , are intended to elucidate further information on this most mysterious of phenomena .",
    "testing the validity of the km mechanism as the sole source of @xmath3 violation is one of the major experimental challenges in high energy physics today .",
    "already , there are some tantalizing hints that @xmath3 violating observables may provide evidence for physics beyond the standard model . in particular",
    ", the world average for the mixing - induced @xmath3 violation parameter in @xmath6 decays ( @xmath7 ; _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath8 ) , is only marginally consistent with that measured in @xmath9 decays ( _ e.g. _ @xmath10 )  @xcite , whereas they are predicted to be equal to within a few percent in the standard model  @xcite .",
    "since the former decays are predominantly governed by flavour changing neutral current penguin amplitudes , they are commonly believed to be sensitive to new physics contributions  @xcite .",
    "the significance of the deviation from the standard model prediction will be clarified once more data has been accumulated and the statistical precision of the measurements improved .",
    "however , it is essential to try to find additional modes which may be sensitive to the same effect , in order to corroborate the evidence and/or investigate which underlying interaction is responsible . in this spirit",
    ", experimental results using the decay modes , and have already been produced  @xcite , alongside those for @xmath8 .",
    "additional modes sensitive to the @xmath11 penguin amplitude would make extremely welcome additions to this set of measurements .",
    "it is not only the @xmath11 penguin transition which is of interest . in general",
    "any decay mode which is sensitive to @xmath3 violation , which to date has only been observed in a handful of decay modes , is certainly worth pursuing .",
    "furthermore , any model which proposes new physics effects in @xmath11 amplitudes via the introduction of a new heavy particle in the loop , may also have an effect on the phase of other `` loop '' amplitudes , such as the @xmath12 penguin or @xmath13 mixing .",
    "so , we are interested in any @xmath14 meson decay mode in which @xmath3 violation , and/or new physics contributions may be investigated . as has been known for some time , neutral @xmath14 decays to @xmath3 eigenstates can exhibit @xmath3 violation with rather straightforward phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "we are also interested in non-@xmath3 eigenstate final states , where new physics contributions have a relatively clean signal , such as radiative @xmath14 decays . in this article we present some examples of final states which we hope may provide fertile ground for investigating these effects at current and future @xmath14 factories",
    "we are considering decays of the form @xmath0 . here",
    "@xmath15 represents a neutral @xmath14 meson ( which can actually be either @xmath15 or @xmath16 ) ; @xmath1 represents any spin-0 neutral particle ( we use @xmath1 since this particle will typically be a pseudo - scalar ( @xmath17 ) , but scalar particles ( @xmath18 ) are also allowed ) .",

    "therefore , we can write down the @xmath3 of the @xmath20 system : @xmath22 where we have assumed that @xmath1 is a @xmath3 eigenstate ( _ i.e. _ @xmath23 ) in the last step .    by conservation of angular momentum in the decay @xmath0 , we obtain @xmath24 since the neutral @xmath14 meson is a spin-0 particle , as are @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in the above equations , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 represent the total , orbital and intrinsic angular momentum , respectively ( and elsewhere @xmath28 , @xmath19 and @xmath29 represent their magnitudes ) .",
    "therefore , the angular momentum between the @xmath20 system and @xmath2 ( @xmath21 ) must be equal to @xmath19 , and we can write down the @xmath3 of the @xmath30 system : @xmath31    therefore , provided that both @xmath1 and @xmath2 are @xmath3 eigenstates , the @xmath30 system will also be a @xmath3 eigenstate , with the same @xmath3 as the @xmath2 .",
    "the possible @xmath1 are @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 ; the possible @xmath2 include all the @xmath1 candidates , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "note that although @xmath37 and @xmath38 are not actually @xmath3 eigenstates , the @xmath3 violation effect in the neutral kaon system is small enough to be ignored .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath37 would be reconstructed via its decay to @xmath42 ( or possibly @xmath43 ) , the final state is actually @xmath44 , which _ is _ a @xmath3 eigenstate . using this rationale",

    ". however , we must also include the possibility that @xmath51 , where the final state contains both @xmath3 even and @xmath3 odd components .",
    "although states with large values of @xmath19 are suppressed due to the angular momentum barrier , some experimental study is required in order to determine the @xmath3 composition in these final states . in the case",
    "that the spin-0 state of @xmath20 is dominant , these modes will be particularly worthy of further study .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    we also consider the special case where @xmath52 . since the photon is a massless vector particle , @xmath53 is forbidden .",
    "therefore , spin-2 is the lowest spin state possible for the @xmath20 system .",
    "decays of the form @xmath54 are of considerable theoretical interest  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath55 can be any hadronic self - conjugate @xmath3 eigenstate , and @xmath56 is not required to be a @xmath3 eigenstate since this does not affect the time - dependent asymmetry .",
    "since the @xmath20 system must contain an even number ( 0 , 2 or 4 ) of each quark + anti - quark flavour , decays of the form @xmath57 can only occur via @xmath58 transitions .",
    "other decay modes sensitive to the same amplitude ( typically @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) suffer from considerable experimental difficulties .",
    "for that reason , modes such as @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 may be useful to study mixing - induced asymmetries in @xmath58 decays .",
    "since the @xmath20 system must have spin of at least two , decays of this form may be suppressed due to the angular momentum barrier . however , evidence for a radiative transition resulting in a tensor meson , has been observed with a branching fraction of @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "thus , observation of similar decays mediated by the @xmath12 transition ( _ e.g. _ @xmath65 ) via @xmath66 final states may soon be within reach of the @xmath14 factories .      it may be noted that the use of bose - einstein statistics in the above argument is , in fact , not necessary . if we consider decays of the type @xmath67  @xcite , where the three final state particles are different @xmath3 eigenstate spin-0 neutral particles , eq .",

    "we can then write down the @xmath3 of the final state ,",
    "@xmath73    this realisation greatly increases the number of possible final states .",
    "however , in many cases , decays with three different final state particles may have contributions from a number of different amplitudes , complicating the phenomenological interpretation of their time - dependence .",
    "exceptions may arise in the case that two or more of the particles are from the set @xmath74 , or when the final state includes @xmath37 and @xmath38 ; nevertheless , we restrict ourselves to the case @xmath75 in the main part of this paper .",
    "note however one useful consequence of this observation : in the case of studying time - dependent @xmath3 violation in a decay such as @xmath76 with @xmath77 , any background from @xmath78 , either non - resonant or produced via some other intermediate state , can be treated as signal since it has the same @xmath3 eigenstate .",
    "( possible contributions from different amplitudes may however pollute the interpretation of the result . )",
    "in the remainder of this article , we consider specific decays of the form @xmath0 where both @xmath1 and @xmath2 are spin-0 neutral particles .",
    "as is clear from table  [ tab : p0p0x0 ] , there are an enormous number of modes of this type .",
    "we should consider which of these are most likely to be useful , in terms of both a clean phenomenological interpretation , and of the possibility of obtaining a sufficiently large sample to study @xmath3 violating effects .",

    "time - dependent studies of many of these modes appear experimentally feasible with the large data samples which can be obtained at a `` super @xmath14 factory '' . for modes which use multiple photons in the reconstruction , the environment at @xmath226 machines is preferable to that at hadron colliders .",
    "furthermore , it is only at @xmath226 machines that precise knowledge of the interaction point can be obtained to allow the @xmath14 vertex to be reconstructed from a single @xmath37 meson .",
    "reconstruction of the @xmath14 vertex from multiple @xmath37 mesons ( _ e.g. _ in @xmath4 ) at hadron colliders , appears experimentally challenging , but not impossible .    of the possible @xmath0 decays",
    ", @xmath4 appears to be an extremely promising mode to study the @xmath227 transition and search for phases from new physics .",
    "first results with this mode may be obtained at the present @xmath14 factories in the near future .",
    "in addition , @xmath94 , @xmath181 , @xmath228 and @xmath229 appear deserving of further study .",
