    "for example , spin - orbit interaction couples the orbital motion of electrons to the exchange field of the magnet , causing an anomalously strong dependence of the conductivity on magnetization direction.@xcite also electronic scattering from spatial or temporal inhomogeneities of the magnetization in space and time , such as domain walls and spin waves , can lead to dephasing@xcite and it can qualitatively affect the metallic resistivity.@xcite    in this article we address the tunneling density of states , which is a key property in devices in which metallic and insulating layers alternate .",
    "for a normal metal , the interplay of disorder and coulomb interaction effects causes the tunneling density of states to deviate from the thermodynamic density of states for low temperatures and excitation energies.@xcite in three dimensions , the temperature dependence of the correction to the density of states follows a square - root power law .",
    "while it is clear that for a weakly disordered ferromagnet the same effects modify electronic density of states , in a ferromagnet fluctuations of the magnetic order may cause an additional correction to the density of states .",

    "we take the viewpoint that the emission and absorption of spin waves leads to an effective interaction between the electrons ( in the same way as that the emission and absorption of phonons leads to an effective electronic interaction in the theory of superconductivity ) , and consider the resulting correction to the density of states for a disordered ferromagnet , analogous to the coulomb - interaction induced correction to the density of states of a normal metal .",
