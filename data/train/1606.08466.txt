    "finally , the light which passes through the atoms @xmath2 and the light which does not pass through @xmath3 are interfered and photons are counted to obtain a signal @xmath4 . ]",
    "we previously developed a theory of pci measurements at the single shot level in ref .",
    "the basic idea of the method is to first explicitly calculate the entangled state between the atoms and the light induced by the ac stark shift .",
    "projecting the photons on the interference basis , we were able to relate the difference of the photon counts to the average @xmath5 spin of the bec by a simple expression .",
    "the method both yields the amount of information about the quantum state that can be obtained , and the backaction on the state . in this paper",
    ", we give an extended treatment of the single shot pci theory developed in ref .",
    ". we derive expression for the measurement operator that embodies both the information and the backaction due to the measurement .",
    "we show that the backaction due to the measurement scrambles and shifts the relative phase of the atomic condensates , but is controllable by the degree of atom - light interaction .",
    "we demonstrate that the measurement has the best performance for the dimensionless atom - light interaction time being of the order @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the total number of atoms .",
    "our findings complements earlier works that studied the limits on sensitivity @xcite of nondestructive measurement , and the backaction @xcite due to pci measurement .",
    "in particular , refs . @xcite calculated the backaction of pci measurement in a continuous measurement model by deriving an effective master equation , in which the degrees of freedom of probe is traced out .",

    "in addition to the above works , we note that refs .",
    "@xcite studied interactions between atomic ensemble and coherent light in a polarization measurement that is related to pci .",
    "these works used the spectral density of the probe beam that has interacted with an atomic ensemble to estimate the degree of squeezing and entanglement resulting in the states of atomic ensemble .",
    "our work is distinct from such works where the spin ensembles are treated in the continuous variables ( cv ) approximation . in this approach ,",
    "the spins are considered to be polarized in a particular spin direction ( say @xmath8 ) , and the remaining total spin degrees of freedom ( @xmath9 ) are used as the quadrature variables @xcite . in the approach presented in this paper , this approximation is not performed and thereby we are able to go beyond the cv regime . for example , our constructed measurement operator can be applied to any state , not only spin coherent states in the vicinity of polarized states . also it predicts the evolution of an initial spin coherent state into highly non - gaussian states . such result obviously can not be obtained in the cv approximations used in these works  @xcite .",
    "additionally , we aim to estimate the optimum scaling of atom - light interactions such that the measurement of the atomic condensates or ensemble is still minimally - destructive .",
    "we show that to calculate this one requires a beyond - cv analysis , as there is a fidelity loss that is not present in a cv approximation .",

    "the information - disturbance tradeoff was calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite and was found to have a universal behavior . to determine the effect of the backaction on the initial state @xmath191 it is instructive to plot the @xmath193-distribution , which in our case is @xmath194 this is more representative than alternative measures of the backaction such as the fidelity ( i.e. @xmath195 ) , as for many - particle states such as those that we deal here",
    ", there is an exponential suppression of the fidelity with the particle number .",
    "for example , for two spin coherent states that deviate by an angle @xmath196 @xcite , @xmath197 thus a fidelity becomes exponentially sensitive to small angular deviations on the bloch sphere .",
    "for an initial spin coherent state @xmath198 , we may use similar approximations to that discussed in the previous section .",
    "the _ q_-function may be estimated analytically , giving @xmath199 where @xmath200 and @xmath201 is as given in ( [ eq : add01 ] ) .",
    "the analytical expression shows that the measurements affects only the phase @xmath202 of the atomic condensates . in fig .",
    "[ fig : qfunction ] we directly calculate the @xmath193 function numerically using ( [ eq : bck51 ] ) , which shows the same general behavior , a broadening in the @xmath203 direction . from the analytical form ,",
    "we see the measurement causes a drift in the phase of the atomic condensate , @xmath204 .",
    "this can be understood to be an average phase drift given by the light on the bec .",
    "the other effect is the increase in the width of the relative phase to width @xmath205 .",
    "both effects are proportional to the atom - light interaction time , @xmath96 .",
    "weak measurements with the interaction times @xmath111 as described above , tend to preserve the coherent properties of the state @xmath206 of atomic condensate , namely @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",
    "this is true provided that effect of photon statistics on the measurement is small @xmath209 , as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : qfunction](a)(b ) .",
    "however , as the atom - light interaction time increases the relative phase of state @xmath206 is shifted by an amount proportional to the atom - light interaction time @xmath96 .",
    "the growth of @xmath210 is due to a scrambling of the relative phase that causes loss of coherence as shown in fig [ fig : qfunction](c)(d)(e ) .",
    "this is a similar effect to phase diffusion due to atom - atom interaction , which causes each atomic number state to evolve at different rate around the bloch sphere , thereby scrambling the phase @xcite .",
    "the fidelity of the states @xmath211 ( [ eq : bck02 ] ) and @xmath206 ( [ eq : bck50])(not keeping the measurement record ) is @xmath212 where it easily shown that @xmath213 where @xmath214 and @xmath215 is as defined in ( [ eq : add01 ] ) . comparing ( [ eq : add02 ] ) and ( [ eq : bck52 ] ) , it is evident that setting @xmath216 and @xmath217 in ( [ eq : bck52 ] ) and ignoring the normalisation constant gives the fidelity @xmath177 . for @xmath218 ,",
    "the fidelity is unity for all initial value as expected .",
    "however , the fidelity decreases with increasing values of @xmath96 and is vanishingly small for all values of @xmath158 except for @xmath219 . to understand this",
    ", we turn to the _ q_-function where it is easily understood that for the atomic coherent state , the states @xmath219 is a well defined number state with zero phase and are not affected by the fluctuation in phase .",
    "in fact , whereas the _ q_-function shows that the changes in the states of the atoms are due to distortion in the phase of the atomic state , the fidelity for a given initial amplitude @xmath158 measures the resemblance between the initial state and the final state . from the outset , it easily understood that the resemblance of the final state to the initial state is remarkably similar and the fidelity is close to unity if the phase is relatively unscrambled as discussed in the _ q_-function section above .",
    "hence , the fidelity indirectly measures the distortions in the phase of a given amplitude of atomic states , and the distortion proves to be roughly same amount for every initial amplitude @xmath158 .",
    "lastly , we provide estimates for parameters appearing in our model .",
    "the interaction frequency @xmath220 is @xmath221  @xcite , where the average field @xmath222 in terms of the average intensity @xmath223 is @xmath224 . for definiteness",
    ", we consider the @xmath225 line transition of @xmath226 atoms where only the @xmath227 ( @xmath228 ) states are occupied . for pci imaging of @xmath226 atomic bec using @xmath229 polarised laser light of average intensity @xmath230  @xcite and detuning of @xmath231  mhz  @xcite , @xmath232 . to estimate the interaction time @xmath233 , we calculate the time taken by light to traverse the atomic cloud . in ref  @xcite ,",
    "pci laser light was applied to bec along the axis of tightest confinement .",
    "the radius of the cloud along this axis is @xmath234 , giving @xmath235 , where @xmath236 is the refractive index at the peak density of the atoms , @xmath237 is the chemical potential of the bec , @xmath238 is the trap frequency along the axis of tightest confinement , and @xmath176 is the mass of the atom . thus the coupling strength @xmath96 using parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite is @xmath239 .",
    "compared with @xmath240 affirms that the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite was performed in the minimally - destructive regime .    to enter the non - gaussian regime , we require coupling strength in the region of @xmath241 .",
    "this thus requires a further increase of the dimensionless coupling @xmath242 by a factor @xmath243 . for small ensembles",
    "this may readily be achieved by increasing the laser intensity .",
    "alternatively , cavities may be used to enhance the coupling .",
    "enhancements of @xmath244 by factors over @xmath245 are readily obtainable  @xcite , and hence the non - gaussian regime should be reachable using current experimental technology .",
    "in summary , we have presented a theory of single - shot phase contrast imaging of atomic bose - einstein condensates , extending upon the initial work presented in ref .",
    "we derived a measurement operator that fully describes the information obtained from the measurement , as well as the backaction due to the measurement . using the measurement operator , we calculated the probability density and its characteristic features such as the mean , standard deviation , estimation error and fisher information . for the measurement to be described as non - destructive , we found that there is an optimum atom - light interaction time , which scales inversely with the population of atoms in the condensates , @xmath246 . beyond this atom - light interaction time @xmath247 ,",
    "the signal starts to deteriorate until no significant information can be inferred from the measurement .",
    "we showed using the _ q_-function that the state of the atomic condensates suffers significant back - action due to the measurement for times @xmath248 , but is fairly minimal for @xmath246 .",
    "in particular , the back - action shifts and scrambles the relative phase of atomic bec states by an amount proportional to the atom - light interaction time , assuming that the photon statistics plays limited role @xmath249 ( i.e. the total number of atoms @xmath7 in the atomic condensate is greater than the combined average photon number @xmath250 used in the measurement ) .    in this work",
    "we did not take into account the backaction resulting from dephasing due to residual absorption as done in refs .",
    "although light used in the measurement is far - detuned from atomic resonance transition , a small number of atoms are excited .",
    "these atoms decay by spontaneous emission , and do not return to the atomic condensate . because the spontaneous decay process is uncontrolled and random , it leads to the heating of the atomic samples .",
    "recently , it was found that narrow linewidth lasers are highly effective at suppressing the ac stark shift scattering rate due to non - markovian effects @xcite , hence we expect that this can be reduced to a very low level in practice .",
    "we have also assumed that the particle number in the bec is a constant @xmath59 , which may appear to be a strong assumption , as typically shot to shot the particle number in an experiment will vary .",
    "however we point out that we consider a single - shot scenario where the number of atoms in the trap , including both the condensed and thermal fractions , is to a good approximation fixed to @xmath59 .",
    "as long as the light is applied to the atoms in a symmetric way , our theory applies to both becs and ensembles , hence to first order we expect that both the condensed and uncondensed parts contribute in the same way . a full calculation taking these effects into account",
    "is left as future work .",
