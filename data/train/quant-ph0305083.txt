    "in polarimetric experiments , a superposition of internal quantal states evolves in a single spatial beam under a single hamiltonian .",
    "information about the pancharatnam relative phase @xcite is then inferred from projection measurements on the final superposition .",
    "it is thus possible to measure the relative phase without using spatially separated beams , as in interferometry .",
    "this advantage with polarimetry has proved useful in measurements of phases of quantal states .",
    "indeed , this technique was used in the first experiments that measured the cyclic adiabatic berry phase @xcite for two - level systems in terms of polarization of light @xcite and neutron spin @xcite . later",
    ", a test of pancharatnam s relative phase in noncyclic spin@xmath0 polarimetry was put forward @xcite and carried out @xcite . in this paper , we demonstrate that the polarimetric scheme for spin@xmath0 proposed in @xcite may be extended to spin @xmath3 states in noncyclic so(3 ) evolution .",
    "the polarimetric advantage translates into higher precision when working with matter waves .",
    "this comes from a better utilization of the particle source in the polarimetric setup , which allows more of the incoming particles to be used in the experiment @xcite .",
    "the higher effective intensity improves the precision and enables experiments with low - flux particle sources @xcite .",
    "moreover , polarimetry is a more robust method , less sensitive to spatial , mechanical , and thermal disturbances than interferometry .",
    "however , the relative phases can only be measured indirectly in polarimetry , which complicates the theoretical analysis of the measured data . here ,",
    "we show how this complication can be overcome in so(3 ) polarimetry and propose a general method to extract the relative phase and visibility in such experiments .",
    "polarimetric tests of noncyclic relative phases for higher spin states may in practice be done with polarized atomic beams .",
    "an interesting application for such systems could be to verify the noncyclic geometric phase @xcite formula @xmath4 for spin projections @xmath5 subtending the geodesically closed solid angle @xmath6 in the space of directions in ordinary three dimensional space .",
    "such an experiment would extend on the atom interferometry test of the @xmath7 dependence of the cyclic berry phase carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the following section , pancharatnam s relative phase is analyzed for spin@xmath8 in so(3 ) evolutions .",
    "iii describes the noncyclic relative phase in spin@xmath0 polarimetry and in sec .",
    "iv it is extended to @xmath1 .",
    "the paper ends with the conclusions .",
    "the euler representation of so(3 ) evolutions may be expressed in terms of the unitarity ( @xmath9 from now on ) @xmath10 here , for notational convenience we have expressed @xmath11 in terms of the su(2 ) parameters @xmath12 @xcite that are related to the standard euler angles @xmath13 as @xmath14 .",
    "any @xmath15 eigenket @xmath16 undergoes the so(3 ) evolution @xmath17 yielding the pancharatnam relative phase @xmath18 between @xmath16 and @xmath19 as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is real valued ( see , e.g. , eq .",
    "( 6.2.16 ) of ref .",
    "this latter property implies that @xmath22 only takes the values 0 or @xmath23 .",
    "thus , for @xmath24 spin projections these are the only possible values of pancharatnam s relative phase in so(3 ) evolution .",
    "the amount of interference is measured by the visibility @xmath25 , which in the so(3 ) case reads @xmath26 for cyclic evolution where @xmath27 ( modulo @xmath23 ) , we have maximal interference contrast @xmath28 . in the case where @xmath29 , the angle @xmath30 corresponds to the spin flip @xmath31 for which @xmath32 . depending upon the explicit functional form of @xmath33 , there may exist further @xmath34 values for which the visibility vanishes .",
    "we notice that if @xmath35 is parallel transporting , the pancharatnam relative phase can be identified with the noncyclic geometric phase . in such a case @xmath36 ,",
    "@xmath6 being the solid angle enclosed by the path and its shortest geodesic closure in the space of directions in ordinary three dimensional space .",
    "for example , such a parallel transporting unitarity could be realized by a sequence of so(3 ) rotations along great circles in this space .",
    "consider the wagh - rakhecha setup @xcite sketched in fig .",
    "a single beam of spin polarized particles with @xmath37 and magnetic moment @xmath38 is sent through a series of devices .",
    "a superposition of the two orthogonal states @xmath39 is created by rotating @xmath40 around an axis perpendicular to the quantization axis of the initial state . under the influence of the unitarity",
    "@xmath11 the components of the superposition acquire opposite pancharatnam relative phases .",
    "another @xmath41 rotation is applied and the output intensity is subsequently measured along the initial quantization axis .",
    "direction and carrying a magnetic moment @xmath38 are sent through an so(3 ) unitarity , surrounded by two @xmath2 spin flippers . by rigid translation of the spin flippers at relative distance @xmath42 , @xmath43 integer and @xmath44 the particle speed , the noncyclic relative phase is extracted from the output intensities registered at the analyzer.,width=8 ]    for a cyclic evolution , the output state differs from the initial state by a rotation of @xmath45 about the initial quantization axis . for a noncyclic spinor evolution , however , an extra phase shift @xmath46 must be applied to the spin eigenkets @xmath47 and the relative phase can thereafter be inferred from the oscillations of the intensity as measured along the initial quantization axis , when @xmath48 varies .",
    "the extra phase shift @xmath48 is implemented by a guiding magnetic field @xmath49 put over the entire setup and the variation of @xmath48 is achieved by translating the pair of flippers , keeping their relative distance @xmath50 fixed . by choosing @xmath42 , @xmath43 integer and @xmath44 the particle speed ,",
    "one obtains the output intensity @xcite @xmath51 this yields the extreme values @xmath52 at @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively , upon translation of the flippers .",
    "now , up to a sign , the pancharatnam relative phase modulo @xmath23 may be obtained as @xmath55   \\nonumber \\\\    & = & \\cos^2 \\delta = \\frac{i_{\\textrm{\\small{min}}}^{(\\frac{1}{2 } ) } } { 1-i_{\\textrm{\\small{max}}}^{(\\frac{1}{2 } ) } +   i_{\\textrm{\\small{min}}}^{(\\frac{1}{2 } ) } } , \\label{eq : wrpanch}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used that @xmath56 is an integer multiple of @xmath23 .",
    "similarly , we obtain the visibility as @xmath57 thus , a cyclic evolution is characterized by @xmath58 and spin flip corresponds to the case where @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the practical advantage of polarimetry may be limited by the modulo @xmath23 property of the phase measurement , as is clear from the appearance of @xmath61 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wrpanch ] ) .",
    "physically , this arises from the final @xmath62 projection in polarimetry : states with opposite phases give the same @xmath63-intensity .",
    "interferometric experiments , on the other hand , measure modulo @xmath64 , which in particular allows verification of the pauli anticommutation @xcite as well as the @xmath23 phase shift associated with the sign of @xmath65 .",
    "consider the wagh - rakhecha setup @xcite shown in fig .",
    "1 , now for spin @xmath1 associated with a magnetic moment @xmath38 and undergoing an arbitrary so(3 ) evolution . prepare a @xmath15 eigenket @xmath16 as input and apply a @xmath40 flip around the @xmath66 axis .",
    "each component of the resulting superposition of @xmath67 states acquires an extra variable phase shift @xmath68 implemented by the zeeman split due to a guiding magnetic field @xmath69 put over the entire setup .",
    "the so(3 ) evolution is followed by a @xmath41 flip around the @xmath66 axis , and the output intensity in the @xmath70 channel is detected .",
    "this prescription corresponds to the output intensity @xmath71 @xmath72 may be evaluated by introducing a decomposition of the @xmath73 state into spin@xmath0 states @xmath74 and @xmath75 according to ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath76 with the normalization constant @xmath77 and by treating the operator @xmath78 as a product of @xmath79 operators , each rotating the spin-@xmath80 subspace @xmath81 separately , as @xmath82 the summation sign @xmath83 in eq .",

    "terms in the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sum ] ) . however , it is not necessary to work with a fully symmetrized state since the symmetrization deals only with the labeling of the @xmath85 states , while the number of @xmath74 and @xmath75 states remains the same .",
    "the transformation properties are thus unaffected by the symmetrization .",
    "we only need to consider simplified states of the form @xmath86 from the spin@xmath0 case we already know that @xmath79 acts upon @xmath87 and @xmath88 as @xmath89 where @xmath90 now , @xmath78 applied to the state in eq .",
    "( [ eq : simply ] ) yields @xmath91 where we have used binomial expansion and the summation range of the integer @xmath92 is chosen so that the arguments of all factorials are positive .",
    "thus , the intensity @xmath72 for an incident @xmath16 state analyzed in the @xmath70 channel reads @xmath93 where we have used the identities @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "notice that , changing the sign of one of @xmath96 is equivalent to the change of variables @xmath97 . changing the sign of both @xmath7 and @xmath98 yields the same intensity due to the rotational symmetry of the setup .",
    "we proceed by looking for extreme points by solving @xmath99 from this it is evident that all @xmath100 have extreme points at @xmath53 or @xmath54 corresponding to those in the spin-@xmath80 case .",

    "the first few cases are @xmath109 notice here that for all @xmath24 , the noncyclic relative phase is trivially 0 or @xmath23 independent of @xmath110 .",
    "thus , although the intensity and @xmath111 can be calculated for the @xmath24 cases , they are unrelated to the pancharatnam relative phase because @xmath110 does not appear in the phase expression .    we may also obtain the visibility as a function of @xmath102 from the standard expression of the matrix elements @xmath112 .",
    "it yields @xcite @xmath113 the first few cases are @xmath114 notice here that the visibilities for @xmath24 are well - defined in terms of @xmath102 .    in general",
    ", it is impossible to find closed expressions for @xmath101 in terms of the measured intensities .",
    "an interesting exception , however , is the case of spin - coherent states @xcite , characterized by @xmath115 . for such states ,",
    "the intensity reads @xmath116 which allows a direct evaluation of @xmath105 and @xmath117 in terms of the extreme values of @xmath118 according to @xmath119{i_{j , j;\\textrm{\\small{min}}}^{(j ) } } }   { 1-\\sqrt[2j]{i_{j , j;\\textrm{\\small{max}}}^{(j ) } } +   \\sqrt[2j]{i_{j , j;\\textrm{\\small{min}}}^{(j ) } } } ,    \\nonumber \\\\",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the reason for this is that when @xmath115 the state in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sum ] ) consists of a term with all spin components in the same direction , i.e. , @xmath120 this implies that the intensity for the @xmath121 state is nothing but the product of @xmath122 spin-@xmath80 intensities .     as a function of the phase shift @xmath48 that is varied upon translation of the spin flippers .",
    "the phase shifts @xmath123 and @xmath124 are detected by looking for pairs of extreme points at mutual distance @xmath2.,width=8 ]     ( thick curve ) and @xmath125 ( thin curve ) for the input state @xmath126 , as a function of the spin@xmath0 intensity .",
    "the two pairs of horizontal lines correspond to the extreme values for @xmath127 ( dashed line ) and @xmath128 ( dotted line ) at phase shifts @xmath53 and @xmath54 shown in fig .",

    "thus , there is in general many possible @xmath132 values for a given measured intensity . to remove this ambiguity",
    "we may use several intensity profiles . to illustrate this point",
    "let us consider the @xmath133 case , where we have @xmath134 both these intensities have extreme values at @xmath135 and @xmath54 , as shown in fig . 2 for @xmath136 .",
    "these extreme values correspond to the horizontal lines in fig .",
    "3 whose intersections with the theoretical curves in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tc ] ) can be matched to give the solutions @xmath137 and @xmath138 from which we obtain @xmath139 and @xmath140 by using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : wrpanch ] ) and ( [ eq : wrvis ] ) .",
    "the latter value may be used to compute the visibility as @xmath141 .",
    "we finally notice that there might be cases where the problem in assigning unique extreme spin@xmath0 values can not be resolved , because of low visibility and the finite precision in the experimental data .",
    "for example , due to the almost vanishing visibility in the @xmath142 case discussed above , there are crossings near @xmath143 in fig .",
    "3 that in any real experiment would potentially be difficult to tell that they in fact correspond to a spurious solution .",
    "this problem may be overcome either by increasing the resolution of the experiment or by looking at the intensity in more than two output channels .",
    "it is likely that in most cases , any ambiguity of this kind can be resolved in this way .",
    "we have extended the polarimetric setup proposed for spin@xmath0 in ref .",
    "@xcite and implemented in ref .",
    "@xcite for the same case , to spin @xmath1 in noncyclic so(3 ) evolution .",
    "the key feature that makes it possible to extract the noncyclic relative phase and visibility in such experiments is that the output intensity for any spin value is a polynomial function of the corresponding spin@xmath0 intensity .",
    "this entails that the existence of phase shifts at distance @xmath2 corresponding to extreme intensities is general , and these extreme values can in turn be used to extract the desired quantities .",
    "this procedure becomes particularly simple in the case of spin - coherent states , where the noncyclic relative phase and visibility can be expressed directly in terms of the measured intensities .",
    "however , in the general case , such closed expressions do not exist and measurements in several output channels is needed .",
    "an apparent extension of the present work is to consider polarimetric tests of the noncyclic relative phase for spin @xmath1 in su(@xmath144 ) evolution .",
    "previously , the phase in the su(3 ) case has been analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite and a three - channel optical interferometry experiment of the cyclic su(3 ) geometric phase has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . from the perspective of the special unitary group",
    ", it is indeed expected that the wagh - rakhecha setup @xcite should be possible to extend to higher spin in so(3 ) evolution since the su(2 ) group is locally isomorphic to the group of rotations in three dimensional space . however , no such isomorphism exists for higher @xmath145 and thus there is no simple way to extend the su(2 ) method to higher su(@xmath144 ) evolutions using the wagh - rakhecha setup , because an su(@xmath146 ) operator does not work only as a rotation operator .",
    "we hope that the present work will lead to further considerations of polarimetric phase measurements , in particular in connection to special unitary transformations on finite dimensional hilbert spaces , as well as to experiments that tests the pancharatnam relative phase using , e.g. , polarized atomic beams .",
