    "structure of neutron - rich nuclei is one of the frontiers in nuclear physics . in such nuclei",
    ", several exotic phenomena like a halo  @xcite or skin  @xcite structure and disappearance of the traditional magic numbers  @xcite have been discovered with the advance of experimental techniques and accelerators .",
    "these findings are unexpected by the standard nuclear structure model and precede the development of the theory .",
    "recently , we reported another exotic phenomenon of extremely suppressed @xmath3(@xmath12 )  value for the transition between the first @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) state to the ground ( @xmath15 ) state in neutron - rich @xmath7c  @xcite . the @xmath3(@xmath12 )  was obtained by measuring the mean lifetime of the @xmath14 state ( @xmath16 ) using a new experimental technique . in general",
    ", an even - even atomic nucleus has properties as a quantum liquid drop . in the liquid - drop model , the @xmath3(@xmath12 )  value is inversely proportional to the excitation energy of the @xmath14 state ( @xmath17(2@xmath18 ) )  @xcite .",
    "however , the measured @xmath3(@xmath12 )  of @xmath7c  was found to deviate greatly from the value expected by the empirical formula  @xcite of the @xmath17(2@xmath18 ) , indicating a suppressed proton collectivity in @xmath7c .",
    "contrary to the suppressed proton collectivity , a large neutron collectivity was suggested based on the measurement of the interference between the nuclear and electromagnetic interactions in the excitation from the ground state to the @xmath14 state  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the large quadrupole deformation length of @xmath7c  extracted from the proton inelastic scattering also indicates that the neutrons contribute predominantly to the strength of the excitation to the @xmath14 state , whereas the protons seem to be frozen  @xcite .",
    "the suppressed @xmath3(@xmath12 )  may indicate quenched effective charges and/or the emergence of a new magic number @xmath19 in the light neutron - rich carbon isotopes . for neutron - rich nuclei ,",
    "the isovector quadrupole mode is likely to be enhanced owing to the large isospin",
    ". such enhancement will give rise to quenched isovector effective charges  @xcite , in particular , a small neutron effective charge that reduces the contribution of the valence neutron(s ) to the @xmath3(@xmath12 )  value .",
    "indeed , the quenched effective charges have been observed in the neighboring @xmath20b nuclei  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the case of the closed shell nuclei , the isoscalar polarization will also be reduced  @xcite . in this light ,",
    "the emergence of the proton magic number @xmath19 has been suggested by a shell model calculation  @xcite .    besides the shell model calculation",
    ", several other microscopic models have also been proposed to explain the mechanism of the small @xmath3(@xmath12 )  value for @xmath7c . a calculation using antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd )",
    "has attributed the anomalous feature to the opposite deformations in the proton and the neutron matters  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that calculations assuming a simple structure that @xmath7c is composed of @xmath21c + @xmath22+@xmath22 have also reproduced the @xmath17(2@xmath18 )  and the @xmath3(@xmath12 )  of this nucleus  @xcite . to shed light on the exotic phenomenon exhibited by @xmath7c and to scrutinize the claim for the emergence of the @xmath19 magic number in the neutron - rich c isotope , more experimental information",
    "specifically the information on the neighboring @xmath1c  isotope is needed .    in this article ,",
    "we report the lifetime measurement of the @xmath14 state in the @xmath1c  nucleus by means of an upgraded recoil shadow method .",
    "the remeasurement of the lifetime of the @xmath14 state in @xmath7c  is also reported .",
    "the @xmath16 of @xmath1c  is expected to be as long as that for @xmath7c  since the energy level schemes of the nuclei are almost identical .",
    "specifically , the @xmath17(2@xmath18 )  values are 1766  @xcite and 1585(10 )  kev  @xcite ; the one - neutron separation energies ( @xmath23 ) are 4250(4 ) and 4180(30 )  kev , for @xmath7c  and @xmath1c , respectively  @xcite . in addition , we have measured the lifetimes of the @xmath24 state in @xmath25be and the @xmath26 state in @xmath7n to verify the method .",
    "for earlier works on the recoil shadow method ( rsm ) , we refer the readers to ref .  @xcite . in both the previous  @xcite and the present work",
    ", we applied the rsm to @xmath9 decays from the excited radioactive nuclei .",
    "the rsm makes use of the shadow effect of a lead shield placed around a reaction target on nai(tl ) detectors of a highly segmented @xmath9-ray detector array . in this method ,",
    "excited nuclei are produced via inelastic scattering or fragmentation reaction of an intermediate - energy radioactive nuclear beam ( rnb ) in the reaction target .",
    "each nucleus then travels a certain distance before decaying through emission of a @xmath9 ray , which is detected by the nai(tl ) detector array .",
    "the yield of the @xmath9 rays detected by each nai(tl ) detector depends on the emission point and the @xmath9-ray angular distribution ; the latter is governed by the alignment produced by the nuclear reaction  @xcite . since the flight length ,",
    "i.e. the emission point of the de - excitation @xmath9 ray depends on the velocity of the ejectile ( which is known ) and the lifetime of the excited state , assuming that we know the angular distribution of the @xmath9 rays , the lifetime can be determined , in principle , by observing the yield distribution of the @xmath9 rays . for lifetimes of as short as a few tens of picoseconds , however , the yield distribution is not sensitive to the small variation of the emission point . hence , determination of such lifetimes is achieved with the presence of the lead shield , which enhances the lifetime dependence of the yield distribution .    in the previous work  @xcite , we bombarded a @xmath27be target with a 40-mev / nucleon @xmath7c  beam and detected the de - excitation @xmath9 rays with only two layers of nai(tl ) detectors placed cylindrically around the beam axis .",
    "the mean lifetime was determined by comparing the ratio between the @xmath9-ray yields detected in the two layers with a calculated ratio function , which was obtained for several mean lifetimes through simulations .",
    "however , the angular distribution of the @xmath9 rays was not measured , and thus we had assumed the angular distribution obtained by a theoretical calculation .    in this work ,",
    "we have made three improvements to the rsm .",
    "first , we determined the lifetimes independent of the angular distribution . for the determination of each lifetime , two measurements of the @xmath9-ray yields",
    "were performed : one with the lead shield installed , and the other without the lead shield .",
    "the @xmath9-ray yield from the former measurement carries the information of both the lifetime and the @xmath9-ray angular distribution , while that from the latter measurement carries mainly the information of the angular distribution .",
    "hence , we can determine the lifetime by comparing the ratio of the two @xmath9-ray yields to a simulated ratio function .",
    "second , we compensated the drop ( by almost two orders of magnitude ) in the beam intensity from @xmath7c  to @xmath1c  by increasing the number of detectors from 32 in the previous setup to 130 .",
    "the last improvement was achieved by using a fast @xmath1c  beam at an energy of about 79 mev / nucleon , thus increasing the flight length by a factor of about 1.4 .    as will be shown later",
    ", the results for @xmath25be and @xmath7n demonstrate that the present rsm is a reliable and powerful means to determine the lifetimes of nuclear excited states with simple or known @xmath9-decay schemes .",
    "because the present rsm is independent of the @xmath9-ray angular distribution , it is applicable to any type of nuclear reaction that produces excited nuclei . and",
    "as such , one can measure the lifetimes of excited states produced by any kind of reaction channels with the intermediate - energy rnb in a single experiment .",
    "in fact , we have also successfully measured the lifetimes of excited states in @xmath28c , produced by one - neutron knockout reaction of @xmath1c  @xcite .",
    "in the experiment , we measured the lifetime of the @xmath14 state of @xmath1c  populated via inelastic scattering of the @xmath1c beam at 79  mev / nucleon and those of the excited states in @xmath25be and @xmath7n produced through breakup reaction of the @xmath1c  beam .",
    "we also measured the lifetime of the @xmath14 state of @xmath7c  populated via two reactions , namely the inelastic scattering of a 72-mev / nucleon @xmath7c beam and the breakup reaction of the 79-mev / nucleon @xmath1c  beam .",
    "furthermore , we measured the angular distribution of the @xmath9 rays for the @xmath14 state of @xmath7c  inelastically excited at 40  mev / nucleon in order to incorporate it into the experiment data in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the experiment was performed at the riken accelerator research facility .",
    "secondary beams of @xmath29c were produced in two separate measurements through projectile fragmentation of an 110-mev / nucleon @xmath30ne primary beam , and separated by the rips beam line  @xcite .",
    "particle identification of the secondary beam was performed event - by - event by means of the time - of - flight ( tof)-@xmath31 method using two 1.0-mm - thick plastic scintillation counters located at the second and final focal planes of rips .",
    "the beams were directed at a 370-mg/@xmath32 @xmath33be target placed at the exit of the rips beam line .",
    "two sets of parallel plate avalanche counters ( ppacs ) were placed upstream of the target to measure the position and angle of the projectile incident upon the target .",
    "the @xmath29c beam had typical intensities of @xmath34 and @xmath35 particles per second , respectively .",
    "outgoing particles from the target were identified by the @xmath31-@xmath17-tof method using a plastic scintillator hodoscope  @xcite located 3.8  m downstream of the target .",
    "the hodoscope , with an active area of 1.0@xmath361.0  m@xmath37 , consisted of thirteen vertical @xmath31-scintillator slats and sixteen horizontal @xmath17-scintillator bars with 5.0 mm and 60.0 mm thicknesses , respectively .",
    "the scattering angles were determined by combining the hit position information on the hodoscope with the incident angles and hit positions on the target obtained by the ppacs .",
    "-ray detectors .",
    "a beryllium target is surrounded by a 5  cm - thick lead shield , and 10 layers of nai(tl ) scintillators ( l1 @xmath38 l10 ) placed cylindrically around the beam axis . for clarity ,",
    "only part of the detectors and lead shield is shown in the inset.,width=302 ]    in order to implement the rsm concept , a thick @xmath9-ray shield was placed around the target , as shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "the shield was a 5  cm - thick lead block with an outer frame of 24@xmath3624  @xmath32 and an inner hole of 5.4  cm in diameter .",
    "the inner hole surrounded the beam tube housing the @xmath33be target .",
    "we removed the lead shield during measurement of the angular distribution of @xmath9 rays .",
    "for the sake of later discussion , the @xmath39-axis is defined as the beam direction , which is close to the flight direction of the de - exciting nucleus .",
    "the origin of the @xmath39-axis , @xmath40  cm , was taken at the upstream edge of the lead shield .",
    "we have carried out both measurements , namely the measurements with and without the lead shield , with the target placed at @xmath41  cm and @xmath42  cm .",
    "we refer to these setups as the `` upstream setup '' and the `` center setup '' hereinafter .    the @xmath9-rays from the excited nuclei in - flight were detected by an array of 130 nai(tl ) detectors , which form part of the dali1  @xcite and the dali2  @xcite .",
    "the nai(tl ) detectors , all of which are rectangular in shape , are of three different sizes : @xmath43  @xmath44 , @xmath45  @xmath44 , @xmath46  @xmath44 .",

    "the layers are closely packed to cover polar angular ranges of @xmath48 and @xmath49 in the laboratory frame .",
    "the detectors were mounted on and supported by nine 3-mm - thick aluminum plates .",
    "the distances of the center of the detectors from the center of the be target ranged from 28  cm to 56  cm .    in the present work",
    ", we counted the number of full - energy - peak events detected by each layer during the measurements with and without the lead shield .",
    "for convenience , the numbers obtained with the @xmath50-th layer during the former and the latter measurements are denoted by @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the @xmath51 and @xmath52 were obtained by fitting the measured @xmath9-ray energy spectra with response functions obtained with simulations , plus @xmath9-ray spectra for the @xmath21c isotope as backgrounds .",
    "the spectra for @xmath21c were selected because ( i ) all excited states in @xmath21c lie at energies above 6 mev , and there is no significant @xmath9 line around 1.6 mev , ( ii ) the @xmath21c isotope was produced through projectile fragmentation reaction of the @xmath1c  ( or @xmath7c ) in the secondary target , and as such its `` background spectrum '' resembles that of for @xmath1c  ( or @xmath7c ) .",
    "as mentioned earlier , a key point of the present work is the elimination of the dependence of the measured lifetime on the @xmath9-ray angular distribution . for this purpose",
    ", we determined the deficiency of the @xmath9-ray yields due to the lead shield .",
    "the deficiency ( @xmath53 ) of the @xmath50-th layer detectors is defined as the ratio between the yields detected with and without the shield , i.e. @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the normalization factor for different total number of beam particles in the two measurements .",
    "the lifetime was determined by comparison of the measured deficiency ( @xmath56 ) with the simulated one ( @xmath57 ) .",

    "the deficiencies of all layers measured for the respective target position were reproduced by the simulation within accuracies of @xmath60  3% and @xmath60  7% for layers with @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively .",

    "<S> the electric quadrupole transition from the first 2@xmath0 state to the ground 0@xmath0 state in @xmath1c was studied through lifetime measurement by an upgraded recoil shadow method applied to inelastically scattered radioactive @xmath1c nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the measured mean lifetime is @xmath2  ps , corresponding to a @xmath3(@xmath4 ) value of @xmath5@xmath6 , or about 1.5 weisskopf units . </S>",
    "<S> the mean lifetime of the first 2@xmath0 state in @xmath7c was remeasured to be @xmath8  ps , about four times shorter than the value reported previously . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy between the two results was resolved by incorporating the @xmath9-ray angular distribution measured in this work into the previous measurement . </S>",
