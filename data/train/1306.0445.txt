    "secondly , the analytic maps arising from theorem  [ thm : main ] yield interval maps which provide counterexamples to the following conjecture .",
    "[ conj : levinmayer ] let @xmath23 be a bounded domain with @xmath24 and @xmath25 contracting holomorphic mappings with their unique fixed points @xmath26 in @xmath27 .",

    "mayer  @xcite originally conjectured that transfer operators satisfying the hypotheses of the above conjecture have real spectra .",
    "counterexamples to mayer s conjecture were given by levin in  @xcite which led to the above weakening of mayer s conjecture .    before proceeding to definitions and rigorous proofs",
    ", we shall briefly explain the genesis of our result . turning the classical question of finding eigenvalues of @xmath30 for a given map on its head",
    ", we attempt to construct a map for which the transfer operator has a given eigenvalue and a given eigenfunction . considering an analytic expanding map on the interval @xmath31 with two full branches ,",
    "the eigenvalue problem of the transfer operator formally reads @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are an eigenvalue and eigenfunction of @xmath30 .",
    "given an analytic invariant density @xmath35 one may consider for @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 as an equation to compute suitable inverse branches @xmath39 and @xmath40 of the map .",
    "this setup is a particularly simple case of the so called inverse perron - frobenius problem @xcite , which has been applied in various guises to taylor - make chaotic maps with given stationary properties ( see , for example , @xcite ) . as we are attempting to construct a map with two branches we are at liberty to specify a nontrivial eigenvalue and corresponding eigenfunction .",
    "thus , given an invariant density @xmath35 , a real number @xmath2 with @xmath1 , and a potential eigenfunction @xmath41 , we seek to solve @xmath42 for the inverse branches @xmath39 and @xmath40 . here",
    "p and u denote suitable antiderivatives of @xmath35 and @xmath41 , respectively . a priori",
    ", there is no guarantee that admits a real solution for @xmath39 and @xmath40 and that such a solution actually determines an analytic full branch interval map . developing conditions under which this is the case seems to be a challenging task .",
    "nevertheless , if we fix the interval @xmath43 $ ] , take @xmath35 to be the uniform density , and @xmath44 for the eigenfunction with eigenvalue @xmath2 , then leads to @xmath45 after a short calculation it is possible to deduce from an explicit expression for @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and , as we shall see in section  [ sec : circle ] , this indeed determines an analytic full branch map .",
    "it turns out that for this particular example the complete spectrum can be obtained , an observation that provides the main content of theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "certainly , this reasoning does not generally provide examples with fully prescribed spectrum .",
    "however , the method deserves further exploration , as it furnishes maps with given partial spectral information .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : rigorous ] we introduce analytic expanding circle maps , and define banach spaces of holomorphic functions on which the associated transfer operators @xmath5 are compact .",

    "the main purpose of this section is to define suitable function spaces on which transfer operators induced by analytic expanding circle maps are compact .",
