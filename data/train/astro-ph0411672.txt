    "in a previous paper , harries , hilditch & howarth ( 2003 , hereinafter h@xmath803 ) reported the first results of an observational programme to determine the fundamental parameters of stars in eclipsing binaries in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) .",
    "the rationale for this programme was fully described in h@xmath803 , so it suffices to state here that the twin aims of this investigation are to provide tests of evolutionary models for high - mass binary stars , including those that undergo mass - exchanging interactions at early stages in their evolution ; and to provide a set of primary distance indicators to determine the distance to , and line - of - sight depth of , the smc , independently of all other distance calibrators . since publication of h@xmath803 , a joint discussion on ` extragalactic binaries ' was held at the 2003 iau general assembly , and the papers presented there by many authors provide a broad overview of recent progress in this field ( cf .",
    "ribas & gimnez 2004 ) .",
    "h@xmath803 reported combined spectroscopic and photometric analyses of 10 relatively bright binaries ; we now present follow - up observations and analyses of 40 additional targets .",
    "with such a large sample we are insensitive to anomalous individual results ( whether they arise from astrophysical effects or from problems with data , such as unresolved blending in the photometry ) , as well as gaining from simple statistical leverage that gives our results ( and particularly our distance determination ) very high weight .",
    "furthermore , by introducing radial - velocity data , albeit of modest quality , we gain enormously over analyses based solely on light - curve solutions .",
    "we summarize our observing programme in section  [ spobs ] , and the spectroscopic and light - curve analyses in section  [ datanal ] .",
    "section  [ params ] describes comparisons between the derived fundamental astrophysical parameters and evolutionary models for single stars and interacting binary stars , while section  [ dists ] reviews distance determinations .",
    "our programme was devised in 2000 , aiming to exploit both the publication of the optical gravitational lens experiment photometric survey ( ogle - ii ; udalski _ et al . _",
    "1998 ) and the commissioning of the two - degree - field ( 2df ) multi - object spectrograph on the 3.9-m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) .",
    "extensive simulations for realistic expectations of time allocations showed that satisfactory orbital solutions should be obtainable for systems with @xmath9 mag and orbital periods @xmath5 days  constraints ensuring both adequate phase coverage for a reasonable sample , and sufficient signal - to - noise ratio on the faintest targets ( target @xmath10 per wavelength sample per observation ) . with these boundary conditions ( and some further limitations introduced by practical constraints on the positioning of the 2df optical fibres ) we identified an initial sample of 169 smc eclipsing binaries .    our spectroscopy of these targets was obtained in two overlapping 2@xmath11-diameter fields in the central regions of the smc ; details of the field centres , and checks on the astrometry , are described in h@xmath803 .",
    "the data were taken using 2df , in service mode ( as is standard for this instrument ) .",
    "each full observation consisted of two 1800-s integrations ( on , typically , 100 targets simultaneously ) , plus arc and flat - field frames .",
    "integration times of 1800s were used for the target exposures , in seeing of typically 1.52@xmath12 ( cp .",
    "fibre diameters of 2@xmath12 ) .",
    "we used the marginally better - performing of the two spectrographs , with a 1200b grating providing a mean reciprocal dispersion of 1.1px@xmath13 and a resolution of 2  ( the best available with this instrument ) .",
    "the wavelength range of the data is 38554910 , which ensures excellent coverage of the h , he@xmath14i and he@xmath14ii lines that dominate the blue spectra of o and early b stars .",
    "the 2dfdr package ( lewis et al .  2002 ) was used with default settings to reduce all the data .",
    "the resultant spectra have @xmath15 values ranging from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .    from allocations of 12 nights over the 20012003 smc observing seasons",
    ", worthwhile observations were secured on only @xmath18 nights . in consequence ,",
    "the orbital phase coverage is generally poorer than planned , and for any given target depends on the orbital ephemeris and location ( in the field overlap region or otherwise ) .",
    "the final database has a total of more than 5200 spectra of 169 systems , with from 5 to 55 observations per target .",
    "of these 169 systems , @xmath1940%  do not have observations at or near quadrature phases ( even in some cases with 55 spectra ! ) .",
    "the remaining @xmath19100 stars were studied in greater detail , using the procedures described in section  [ datanal ] .",
    "the spectra were normalized by using an interactively defined spline fit to line - free continuum regions .",
    "( in examining each spectrum , any remaining noise spikes caused by cosmic rays etc . could be removed . )",
    "the spectra were then velocity - corrected to the heliocentric reference frame , and ` windowed ' to isolate specific regions which include strong absorption lines , such as 43004500  ( h@xmath20 , he@xmath14i @xmath214388 , @xmath214471 ) .",
    "orbital phases were calculated from photometric ephemerides published by wyrzykowski et al .",
    "( 2004 , based on 4 seasons of ogle - ii photometry ) , where available ; otherwise we adopted results from udalski et al .",
    "( 1998 ; @xmath22 seasons ) .",
    "h@xmath803 described in detail the implementation of spectral disentangling codes which permit precise and direct determinations of the orbital parameters of the binary components , without the need for intermediate steps ( i.e. , measurement of velocities for each component for every observation ) .",
    "we demonstrated that our codes , which implement the algorithm described by simon & sturm ( 1994 ) , give results that agree well with orbital solutions based on the cross - correlation methods previously more frequently used for measuring radial velocities .",
    "compared to these ` traditional ' methods , spectral disentangling not only yields orbital solutions of better precision ( or , indeed , orbital solutions from data that would not be amenable to cross - correlation analyses ) , but also gives disentangled average spectra for each binary component ( at the expense of not returning ` per observation ' velocity measurements ) .",
    "some excellent review papers on the successes of spectral disentangling procedures are given by hadrava ( 2004 ) , hensberge & pavlovski ( 2004 ) , holmgren ( 2004 ) and ilijic ( 2004 ) .",
    "for each system we searched for the best ( least - squares ) orbital solution by conducting grid searches in orbital semi - amplitudes ( @xmath23 ) , given the period and reference epoch .",
    "circular orbits were assumed unless the light curve demonstrated eccentricity . )",
    "the orbits are , however , detectably eccentric , with secondary eclipses displaced from phase 0.50 by up to 0.10 .",
    "] it was found that using data in the phase ranges 0.200.30 and 0.700.80 gave the most reliable and consistent results ; as necessary , wider phase ranges were employed ( 0.150.35 and 0.650.85 ) , but observations closer to conjunctions offer no useful leverage on orbital - velocity amplitudes .    at our spectral resolution ,",
    "many binaries are clearly double - lined at quadrature phases , and well - defined orbital solutions are then readily obtained .",
    "however , the disentangling procedure is somewhat sensitive to the combination of orbital phase coverage and @xmath15 in the data  important limiting factors in our sample . where the grid search yielded multiple @xmath24 minima , the consequent ambiguity",
    "could sometimes be safely resolved by further investigation ( identifying prefered solutions on physical grounds ) . in all cases ,",
    "sequentially finer grid searches were used to refine the solution .",
    "the outcome of this survey was that , of the @xmath19100 systems examined in detail , 40 yielded reliable orbital parameters ( in addition to the 10 systems already discussed in h@xmath803 ) .",
    "the remainder did not provide sensible solutions , in that derived masses and distances were obviously discrepant ( typically by factors of 2 or more ) .",
    "spectroscopic solutions for the 40 ` good ' systems are given in table  [ circorb ] for circular orbits , and table  [ eccorb ] for eccentric orbits .",
    "as the disentangling procedure returns only the semi - amplitudes , the tabulated systemic velocities were determined separately , from a cross - correlation analysis of the disentangled mean spectra against a template spectrum of the o9@xmath14v star 10  lac , using the vcross code ( hill 1982 ) .",
    "the values reported for each binary are the flux - weighted means of the two components .",
    "for eccentric orbits , values of eccentricity , @xmath25 , and longitude of periastron , @xmath26 , were determined from the light - curve solutions ( from the position of secondary eclipse and the durations of the two eclipses ) , and then held fixed in the spectroscopic solutions ( because of selective phase coverage of the spectroscopy ) . and @xmath26 ) from the light - curve solutions .",
    "the velocity corrections rarely exceed 5  km@xmath14s@xmath13and a single iteration between light - curve and spectroscopic solutions gave convergence ( including any adjustments to @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) . ]    the published velocity semi - amplitudes of the 10 systems studied by h@xmath803 were derived from spectra obtained only in the first , 2001 , observing session . since the numbers of useable spectra of these 10 systems has subsequently increased ( and the original data have been re - reduced ) , new orbital solutions were conducted . the mean difference between the published and new semi - amplitudes is @xmath27  km@xmath14s@xmath13  ( s.e . ) , and in no case",
    "did the original and new semi - amplitudes differ by more than the joint 1-@xmath28 uncertainties .",
    "the mean difference in systemic velocities is @xmath29  km@xmath14s@xmath13  ( s.e .",
    ", h@xmath803 minus this paper ) .",
    "this difference reflects the fact that in h@xmath803 , the heliocentric velocity corrections ( @xmath30  km@xmath14s@xmath13 ) were inadvertently applied with the incorrect sign , such that the previously published @xmath20  velocities should be corrected by + 12  km@xmath14s@xmath13 .",
    "it is pleasing that this known mistake should be recovered in the data analysis , and that the expected uncertainties in the velocities ( @xmath31  km@xmath14s@xmath13 ) should be consistent with the dispersion in the results .",
    "other than the correction to the @xmath20  velocities , there is clearly no need to replace the h@xmath803 orbital solutions .",
    "[ cols=\">,^,>,^,>,^,>,>,^,>,>,^ , > \" , ]     results are summarized in table  [ dm_tab ] .",
    "the mean true distance modulus for this sample is @xmath32 ( s.d . ) , ranging 18.2919.48 , and the mean extinction is @xmath33 @xmath34 .",
    "the mean dm may be compared with the value of @xmath35 ( range 18.7119.13 ) obtained from 10 stars by h@xmath803 .    in the present sample , there is no correlation of dm with @xmath36 , @xmath37 , or @xmath20 velocity , but there _ is _ a modest correlation with @xmath38 ( pearson and spearman correlation coefficients indicating that the null hypothesis of no correlation can be rejected with @xmath1999.5%  confidence ) .",
    "[ figdm ] shows that this correlation arises from a simple selection effect : the sample omits intrinsically faint systems with large derived dm , simply because such systems are excluded by our apparent - magnitude cutoff .",
    "this biases the mean dm towards a too - small value .",
    "restricting the sample to @xmath38 brighter than @xmath39 removes any correlation and gives a mean dm of @xmath40 from 29 stars , which we adopt as the best estimate from the present sample .",
    "our results also show no statistically significant correlation of dm with celestial co - ordinates .",
    "however , groenewegen ( 2000 ) has recently analysed the intrinsic structure of the magellanic clouds , using cepheid photometry and adopting a simple triaxial model . for the smc ,",
    "he finds a @xmath192kpc variation in mean distance ( @xmath190.07 in dm ) over the @xmath192@xmath11 spatial extent of our sample .",
    "our results are consistent with this , a linear fit of distance along the projected ` axis ' of the smc suggesting that the ne extreme is @xmath190.1 m closer than the sw .",
    "groenewegen also discusses the line - of - sight depth of the smc , finding an rms depth of 0.11 m ( 3  kpc ) for cepheids .",
    "while the distance moduli from h@xmath803 and the present sample are consistent with a single mean value , the present sample has a significantly larger dispersion ( with 95%  confidence ) .",
    "if the dispersion in the h@xmath803 sample ( for which internal and external error estimates were in close agreement ) were representative of the stochastic errors in the present sample , then the residual dispersion of @xmath190.28m(@xmath198kpc ) in the present sample would reflect astrophysical effects .",
    "however , this is surely a substantial overestimate of the true dispersion in our parent population , given the significantly larger observational uncertainties in the current dataset .",
    "we consider that our results are therefore again consistent with the cepheid studies in this respect .    taking the weighted mean of the two eclipsing - binary samples ( h@xmath803 and the present paper ) ,",
    "our best estimate of the true distance modulus to the smc is @xmath41 ( @xmath42  kpc ) , where the quoted s.e .",
    "is , of course , an _",
    "internal _ error ; the result is subject to systematic uncertainties at the @xmath190.1  mag level , as discussed in detail by h@xmath803 .",
    "much work on the extragalactic distance scale is tied to the lmc distance modulus ( e.g. , the hst hubble constant key project ; freedman et al .",
    "2001 ) , because the structure of that galaxy has historically been regarded as better understood .",
    "we intend to address lmc binaries directly in future work , but the difference in distance moduli , smc@xmath43lmc , is quite well documented as + 0.5 m ( e.g. , udalski et al.1999 , groenewegen 2000 ) .",
    "our smc results therefore imply an lmc dm of @xmath44 , as compared with a value of 18.50 adopted in the key project work .",
    "together with results from h@xmath803 , our sample of smc binaries includes 50 systems . with only two or three obvious exceptions ,",
    "the typical uncertainties are @xmath4510%  on masses , @xmath454%  on radii , and @xmath450.07 on @xmath46  remarkably good values considering the limited spectral resolution and data quality available for this study , and the use only of single - passband light curves . for comparison ,",
    "in a recent review of the observed properties of high - mass eclipsing binaries , hilditch ( 2004 ) adopted similar upper limits for the uncertainties on these quantities derived for galactic o , b binaries , and found only 22 systems that satisfied these criteria .",
    "the aims of this project have thus clearly been realised , in that we have provided good determinations of fundamental parameters for the largest sample of o , b type eclipsing binaries achieved for any galaxy ( including the milky way ) , and have made a direct determination of the smc distance modulus that has exceptionally high precision ( and very good accuracy ) .",
    "we find good agreement between our observations and the evolutionary models , with no evidence for a ` mass discrepancy ' in the models .",
    "this paper is based largely on data obtained at the anglo - australian observatory , and we thank dr terry bridges , in particular , for obtaining the service observations for us in 2001 and 2003 , and for providing much helpful advice in the 2dfdr data - reduction procedures .",
    "we also thank dr elizabeth corbett for obtaining the 2002 data .",
    "we are grateful to the ogle team for making their excellent photometric database publicly available , and to dr graham hill for the use of his light2 code .",
    "this research benefitted from a pparc short - term visitor grant , ppa / v / s/2001/00550 , awarded to the department of physics , university of exeter .",
