    "the dynamics of higher - dimensional hamiltonian systems is of interest to many fields from physics , mathematics , and chemistry .",
    "such systems occur on scales ranging from atoms and molecules  @xcite , over chemical reactions  @xcite and particle accelerators  @xcite to the solar system and galaxies  @xcite . moreover , they exhibit new transport phenomena like arnold diffusion  @xcite .",
    "many of these examples are time - continuous systems , which can be reduced to discrete - time maps : for example , an autonomous hamiltonian system with @xmath0 degrees of freedom leads to a @xmath1-dimensional continuous system that can be reduced using energy conservation and a poincar section to a @xmath2-dimensional symplectic map . moreover , in some cases the dynamics is directly described by such maps  @xcite .",
    "thus , studying generic symplectic maps , which are numerically much more convenient , helps to understand the dynamics of a wide range of systems .     and @xmath3 emanate from the ee fixed point @xmath4 at the center @xmath5 .",
    "specific bifurcations are marked by blue boxed numbers and are discussed in detail in . for a rotating view see http://www.comp-phys.tu-dresden.de/supp/ [ http://www.comp-phys.tu-dresden.de/supp/ ] . ]",
    "symplectic maps of dimension two are well understood , and generically possess a mixed phase space in which regular and chaotic motion coexist .",
    "the dynamics in the 2d phase space is organized by elliptic and hyperbolic periodic orbits .",
    "the local behavior around these points is described by the eigenvalues of the linearized dynamics .",
    "they contain either the frequency @xmath6 describing the regular motion on 1d - tori around an elliptic periodic orbit or the lyapunov exponents of the stable and unstable directions of a hyperbolic periodic orbit .",
    "if a parameter of the map is varied , the frequency of an elliptic fixed point usually changes and crosses rational values , @xmath7 .",
    "depending on @xmath8 different types of bifurcations occur , namely period - doubling ( @xmath9 ) , touch - and - go ( @xmath10 ) , and @xmath8-tupling ( @xmath11 ) bifurcations  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics in maps of dimension four and higher has completely new features as invariant regular tori have an insufficient dimension to be barriers for the chaotic transport in phase space .",
    "this leads to new effects like arnold diffusion  @xcite along so - called resonance channels .",
    "in addition , the organization of the phase space of higher - dimensional maps is more complicated  @xcite : in general , in a @xmath1-dimensional map elliptic @xmath12-dimensional tori  @xcite are surrounded by ( cantor ) families of elliptic @xmath13-dimensional tori  @xcite with @xmath14 .",
    "lower - dimensional tori can additionally originate from bifurcations of other lower - dimensional tori due to resonances  @xcite or the break - up of resonant higher - dimensional tori  @xcite .",
    "moreover , such bifurcations give rise to families of hyperbolic lower - dimensional tori , also called whiskered tori  @xcite , which are part of the so - called normally hyperbolic manifolds ( nhims ) .",
    "they play an important role for chaotic transport  @xcite .",
    "note that the families of lower - dimensional tori are rather cantor families as they are interrupted by infinitely many gaps on finer and finer scales due to resonances and their corresponding bifurcations .",
    "we focus on 4d symplectic maps in the generic regime far from integrability which occur in many practical applications  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , many former studies cover near - integrable systems , in which normal form tools  @xcite can be used . in order to visualize such a generic 4d phase space ,",
    "we employ 3d phase - space slices  @xcite , i.e.  for every point of an orbit the three remaining coordinates inside the slice are considered in a 3d plot , see for an example and for a brief introduction . in a 4d map the regular motion takes place on 2d - tori , some of which are shown as gray rings in . in addition , there are 1d - tori , also called invariant circles or fixed lines , which can be either elliptic or hyperbolic  @xcite . in the 3d phase - space slice",
    "they correspond to single points , which occur in one - parameter families and thus lead to continuous looking lines .",
    "such families of elliptic 1d - tori are either attached to elliptic - elliptic fixed points or arise from bifurcations , see orange and red lines in , respectively .",
    "these families are the skeleton of the regular motion as each 1d - torus is surrounded by 2d - tori and the families of 1d - tori form a hierarchy  @xcite analogously to the island - around - island hierarchy in 2d maps .",
    "the hyperbolic 1d - tori occur in families as well , see green lines in .",
    "furthermore , there are 0d periodic orbits , which can have stabilities elliptic - elliptic ( ee ) , elliptic - hyperbolic ( eh ) , hyperbolic - hyperbolic ( hh ) , and complex - unstable ( cu ) .",
    "they can also undergo bifurcations under parameter variation  @xcite , which , however , is not the subject of this study .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explain the characteristics of the families of elliptic 1d - tori in detail , namely their gaps , bends , and branches as visible in .",
    "it turns out that these structures can be understood as bifurcations of the families caused by crossing resonances .",
    "while bifurcations usually arise under parameter variation , we observe all stages of a bifurcation in a single phase space without varying any parameter .",
    "this is possible because the longitudinal , or intrinsic , frequency of the 1d - tori varies smoothly along the family and plays the role of the bifurcation parameter .",
    "we observe that local 2d projections of the bifurcations in 3d phase - space slices remarkably resemble phase - space plots of bifurcations of periodic orbits in 2d maps .",
    "this is consistent with normal form results for quasi - periodically forced oscillators  @xcite and investigations in 3d volume - preserving maps  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the families of 1d - tori arising from a bifurcation due to a crossing resonance are also the skeleton of this resonance channel .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in we introduce as generic example system two coupled standard maps and give a short review of its dynamics . in bifurcations of families of 1d - tori",
    "are categorized and illustrated in detail .",
    "this local behavior is complemented by an investigation of global properties in .",
    "finally , gives a summary and an outlook .",
    "the special case of symmetry breaking bifurcations is described in and a short review of the used algorithm to compute elliptic and hyperbolic 1d - tori is given in .",
    "we consider as a generic example two coupled standard maps  @xcite , @xmath15 , @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 and periodic boundary conditions are imposed in each coordinate .",
    "the resulting map is symplectic .",
    "the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 control the nonlinearity of the individual 2d standard maps in @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",

    "the eigenvalues @xmath28 of the linearized dynamics around @xmath4 are @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "the mapping has been the subject of several studies  @xcite .",
    "an orbit started at some initial point in the 4d phase space leads to a sequence of points @xmath31 under the map . to visualize such an orbit we use a 3d phase - space slice  @xcite , defined by thickening a 3d hyperplane @xmath32 in the 4d phase space .",
    "explicitly , we consider the slice defined by @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 as it provides a good view of most structures of the map . whenever a point of an orbit lies within @xmath36 , the remaining coordinates",
    "@xmath37 are displayed in a 3d plot , see .",
    "objects of the 4d phase space typically appear in the 3d phase - space slice with a dimension reduced by one like sketched in , provided the object intersects with the slice .",
    "thus , a typical 2d - torus ( gray ) leads to two or more 1d lines ( black ) .",
    "a typical 1d - torus ( blue line ) leads to two or more points ( orange spheres ) . as 1d - tori occur in families ,",

    "is described by only one longitudinal frequency @xmath55 which is also called intrinsic or internal frequency or rotation number .",
    "if the 1d - torus is elliptic , it is surrounded by 2d - tori . for a sequence of such 2d - tori converging to a 1d - torus , one of the two frequencies @xmath48 converges towards the longitudinal frequency @xmath55 , see .",
    "the limit of the other frequency corresponds to the normal frequency @xmath38 describing the rotation of points normal to the elliptic 1d - torus  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the families of 1d - tori are represented by the edges in frequency space , see .",

    "these bifurcations occur as the frequencies @xmath55 and @xmath38 , which vary smoothly along every family , cross resonance lines , see . to study the structures at a bifurcation we compute the newly emerging elliptic and hyperbolic families of 1d - tori , see for details , and relate all involved objects in phase space and in frequency space .",
    "bifurcations of 1d - tori were also investigated for quasi - periodically forced oscillators  @xcite and 3d volume - preserving maps  @xcite , and it was found that the normal coefficient @xmath64 of the crossing resonance is the relevant parameter to categorize such bifurcations . in the following , we discuss the different cases of @xmath64 to explain the structures in phase space starting with the generic case @xmath66 ( branches ) and then continue with @xmath67 ( branches ) , @xmath68 ( gaps ) , @xmath69 ( bends ) and @xmath70 ( gaps ) .",

    "it turns out that for @xmath72 the features of the bifurcations of families of 1d - tori in 4d maps resemble bifurcations of fixed points in 2d maps .    in the following we refer to the family of 1d - tori which is crossed by a resonance as _",
    "main family_. families of elliptic 1d - tori created in a bifurcation also undergo bifurcations which leads to a whole hierarchy  @xcite .",
    "all bifurcations occur independent of the hierarchy and of the origin of the family , i.e.  whether they arise from fixed points or from other bifurcations .",
    "thus , without loss of generality we concentrate on the first level of the hierarchy , i.e.  in the following the main family is always either @xmath50 or @xmath3 indicated in orange .    in the visualizations we observe that the gaps within the families of 1d - tori created in a bifurcation get very small close to the main family .",
    "it is known that for elliptic families of 1d - tori attached at ee fixed points these gaps get exponentially small with the distance to the fixed point  @xcite .",
    "thus , we conjecture that also the gaps in the families of 1d - tori arising from a bifurcation get exponentially small close to the main family .    to visualize and analyze the bifurcations , we use in addition to the frequency space and the 3d phase - space slice also local 2d projections of the 3d phase - space slice .",
    "they are useful to relate the results to both 2d bifurcations and normal form results .",
    "the basic methods and concepts are introduced in detail in the following section .      for @xmath74",
    "one obtains generic bifurcations of a family of 1d - tori in which one elliptic and one hyperbolic family of 1d - tori are created . as the geometry of the 1d - tori",
    "is dictated  @xcite by the crossing resonance condition @xmath75 , each 1d - torus consists of @xmath76 disjoint but dynamically connected loops .",
    "furthermore , the families of 1d - tori appear in a typical 3d phase - space slice as alternating @xmath52 elliptic and @xmath52 hyperbolic branches .    as an example we discuss in detail the @xmath77 resonance intersecting @xmath50 ,",
    "i.e.  @xmath78 , see .",
    "this resonance causes the red and green branches in phase space marked by in .",
    "this example is visualized in several ways in : figure [ fig : res_5_-5_1_fs ] shows a zoom of the frequency space of close to the crossing point of the resonance and the main family  @xmath50 . in the structure is shown in a 3d phase - space slice , which is a rotated magnification of .",
    "there one can see five hyperbolic ( green ) and five elliptic ( red ) branches emerging out of the main family @xmath50 ( orange ) .",
    "note that the branches consist of individual points , where each point corresponds to an intersection of a 1d - torus with the 3d phase - space slice .",

    "the resulting 2d plots look remarkably similar to a period-5-tupling bifurcation in 2d maps .",
    "however , the interpretation is different : an isolated point in the local 2d projections corresponds to a 1d - torus while a closed line corresponds to a 2d - torus . for a 2d map",
    "these objects would correspond to a periodic point and a regular torus , respectively .",
    "these observations are consistent with normal form results obtained for parametrized families of quasi - periodically forced hamiltonian oscillators  @xcite .",

    "note that the normal form does not describe any gaps in the arising families , which are visible in .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the new elliptic and hyperbolic families of 1d - tori shown in and their surrounding form the resonance channel in phase space . in frequency space in this whole phase - space region collapses to the resonance line @xmath77 .    in and chaotic orbits with initial conditions inside the resonance channel",

    "bifurcations with @xmath68 cause gaps in the main family of elliptic 1d - tori in the sense that the family contains a segment of hyperbolic 1d - tori : firstly , the main family of elliptic 1d - tori changes its stability to hyperbolic while one elliptic family emerges , appearing as two branches in the 3d phase - space slice .",
    "secondly , the main family of now hyperbolic 1d - tori becomes elliptic again and a hyperbolic family emerges , also appearing as two branches in the 3d phase - space slice .",

    "hence , the coefficients @xmath111 exchange their roles along the family of 1d - tori .",
    "this implies , that the longitudinal and the normal radius , see , of the original , resonant 2d - tori interchange along the resonance , i.e.  the normal radius increases and the longitudinal radius decreases .",
    "we now illustrate the geometry of this connection by a visualization in phase space .",
    "for this we use the 3d phase - space slice , which in case of the considered @xmath112 resonance can be reduced further to a plot in the @xmath113-plane .",

    "the change in geometry of the 1d - tori when going from @xmath50 to @xmath3 along the resonance is illustrated in ( b)(f ) by color projections , i.e.  the fourth coordinate @xmath116 is encoded in color .",

    "one of the two elliptic families is embedded in @xmath50 , see fig .",

    "@xcite , while the other elliptic family of 1d - tori is , as in , the counterpart to the hyperbolic family of 1d - tori . following the hyperbolic family away from the bifurcation the geometry of the broken",
    "2d - torus becomes visible .",
    "for instance , the 1d - torus shown in ( c ) consists of ten disjoint rings , which are arranged like an orbit on a 2d - torus with resonant longitudinal frequency @xmath117 .    with increasing distance from the family @xmath50 the rings",
    "get larger and start to overlap in the 3d projection , see ( d ) .",
    "this continues until the ten rings are oriented in the longitudinal direction like an orbit on a 2d - torus with resonant normal frequency @xmath118 , see ( e ) . finally , all rings collapse onto one 1d - torus of @xmath3 , see ( f ) .",
    "this corresponds to a type @xmath119 bifurcation caused by the @xmath115 resonance crossing @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the connection between @xmath50 and @xmath3 along the resonance can be seen as exchange of the longitudinal and the normal radius of the original 2d - tori .",
    "note that we observe a surprising change of stability along the connection shown in .",
    "the connecting family starts hyperbolic ( green ) at the eh periodic orbit ( b ) and later changes stability to elliptic ( red ) . at the same point",
    "the corresponding elliptic family of 1d - tori turns hyperbolic .",
    "thus one could call this a transcritical bifurcation of a 1d - torus because an exchange of stability occurs along the family . whether this is a generic phenomenon for such connections or specific to the investigated resonance and system",
    "requires further investigation .",
    "in this paper we investigate the bifurcations of families of elliptic 1d - tori which occur when they cross resonances .",
    "we observe all stages of the bifurcations in the phase space of one 4d map without varying any parameter .",
    "this is possible because the longitudinal and normal frequencies of the families vary smoothly along a family . as regular 2d - tori",
    "are arranged around the skeleton of families of elliptic 1d - tori their bifurcations leading to gaps , bends , and new branches crucially determine the organization of the regular structures in phase space .",
    "to visualize the structures we use the frequency space , 3d phase - space slices , and local 2d projections of the 3d phase - space slices .",
    "on a resonance the longitudinal and the normal frequency fulfill a condition @xmath120 .",
    "the crucial number determining the type of the bifurcation is @xmath64 .",
    "if a family of elliptic 1d - tori crosses a resonance with @xmath69 , it will form prominent bends .",
    "a @xmath68 bifurcation leads to an intermediate change of stability and hence to a gap in the regular structures . at each end of the gap a new family emerges .",
    "the most complicated structure is caused by @xmath67 bifurcations . before the bifurcation a pair of families of elliptic and hyperbolic 1d - tori is created from which the hyperbolic family collapses onto the main family and re - emerges afterwards with opposite orientation .",
    "for generic bifurcations with @xmath74 one elliptic and one hyperbolic family of 1d - tori emerges directly from the main family . in the 3d phase - space slice",
    "the new families appear as @xmath121 branches of alternating stability . using local 2d projections",
    "we demonstrate that all the results are consistent with normal form predictions and numerically support the conjecture that they are also valid for generic 4d maps  @xcite . in terms of these 2d projections",
    "the bifurcations in 4d maps resemble bifurcations of fixed points in 2d maps .",
    "the families of 1d - tori emerging from a bifurcation form the skeleton of the corresponding resonance channel .",
    "we investigate the families along a resonance channel even far away from the bifurcation . for bifurcations with @xmath74",
    "we find an interesting relation between the new elliptic and hyperbolic families : for each pair of elliptic and hyperbolic 1d - tori the normal frequency @xmath38 and the lyapunov exponent @xmath105 match surprisingly well , @xmath122 .",
    "thus , based on the elliptic family it is possible to gain information on the hyperbolic family , which is numerically much harder to find and to compute . moreover , for resonances intersecting the two main families of 1d - tori an interesting , non - trivial geometric connection is observed .",
    "there are also several interesting open questions and future applications : where and why do families of elliptic and hyperbolic 1d - tori end ?",
    "how do bifurcations of periodic points connect with the picture obtained from the bifurcations of families of 1d - tori ?",
    "furthermore , based on the skeleton of a resonance channel one can investigate how the stable and unstable manifolds of the families of hyperbolic 1d - tori govern the chaotic transport .",
    "moreover , understanding the geometry of junctions of resonance channels is of importance as they play an important role for chaotic transport in the arnold web .",
    "we are grateful for discussions with henk broer , holger dullin , lex haro , ngel jorba , srihari keshavamurthy , alejandro luque , and jim meiss .",

    "for bifurcations of periodic orbits in 2d area - preserving maps it is well - known that the presence of symmetries leads to additional types of bifurcations  @xcite . in this section",
    "we demonstrate that symmetries also cause new types of bifurcations of families of 1d - tori in addition to the ones described in .",
    "moreover , we discuss further implications of the presence of symmetries for families of 1d - tori .",
    "the symmetries of a variant of the reversible  @xcite 4d map , were already studied  @xcite . from this one obtains the reversing symmetry operator @xmath123 with @xmath124 , @xmath125 , for the map .",
    "a reversing symmetry  @xcite is an involution , @xmath126 , and allows for a simple expression of the inverse map , @xmath127 .",
    "using an inversion , i.e.  changing the sign of all coordinates , one obtains a further reversing symmetry  @xcite @xmath128 as an example we explain the unusual bifurcations corresponding to the resonances @xmath129 and @xmath130 shown in by these two symmetries .    for the @xmath129",
    "resonance intersecting @xmath3 with @xmath131 one would expect , according to , a strong bend of the family in phase space . instead , in phase space",
    "a large gap with new branches at each end and in frequency space prominent bends are observed .",
    "thus , this corresponds to the geometry found for the case @xmath132 , see .",
    "however , for the @xmath129 resonance the new branches are not dynamically connected , i.e.  twice the number of families arise .",
    "the symmetry operator @xmath133 provides the mapping between these two families .",
    "this demonstrates the symmetry - breaking nature of this bifurcation , similar to the symmetry - breaking period - doubling of periodic orbits in area - preserving maps .",
    "note that for @xmath131 we only observe symmetry breaking when @xmath134 is even .    for the @xmath130 resonance intersecting @xmath3 one would also expect the @xmath131 behavior .",
    "instead , the geometry in phase space even looks like a @xmath135 bifurcation , i.e.  in a 3d phase - space slice four elliptic branches emerge directly from the main family .",
    "again these branches are not dynamically connected : one pair of them is related by @xmath133 , while the other pair is related by @xmath136 . hence , this is a double symmetry breaking bifurcation of a family of 1d - tori .",
    "note that the corresponding four families of hyperbolic 1d - tori were not found due to technical difficulties .",
    "the presence of symmetries has further implications for families of 1d - tori : consider a 1d - torus with longitudinal frequency @xmath137 , which can be represented by @xmath138 with @xmath139 and @xmath140 , see .",
    "such a 1d - torus is mapped by a symmetry @xmath141 to a 1d - torus with same frequency , as from @xmath142 and @xmath143 follows @xmath144 .",
    "for instance , each of the families @xmath50 and @xmath3 is mapped by a symmetry to a family of 1d - tori . as the families @xmath50 and @xmath3 are the only families which contain the ee fixed point @xmath145 , which is invariant under the symmetries @xmath133 and @xmath136 , there are only two options : either @xmath146 and @xmath147 , or @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "as the range of frequencies @xmath137 of these families @xmath50 and @xmath3 does not coincide , see , the first option holds , i.e.  the families @xmath50 and @xmath3 are invariant under @xmath133 and @xmath136 .",
    "furthermore , we observe that every 1d - torus of these families has exactly two intersection points @xmath150 with the 3d slice @xmath151 . the points @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 also have @xmath156 , since @xmath157 is conserved under @xmath133 and @xmath136 , see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : s1 ] ) and ( [ eq : s2 ] ) .",
    "thus , this set of points has to coincide with the set of points @xmath158 .",
    "this is only possible if the intersection points are of the form @xmath159 , @xmath160 .",
    "for this reason the families @xmath50 and @xmath3 intersect with the 2d plane defined by @xmath161 on a line rather than just in a point . to show this for other families of 1d - tori",
    "similar arguments may be applied .",
    "to compute invariant 1d - tori we use a fourier expansion method  @xcite . in the following",
    "we will give a brief review  @xcite to comment on specific choices of parameters used in this paper .",
    "the basic idea of the method is to describe a 1d - torus by a finite fourier series @xmath162 with @xmath163-dimensional coefficients @xmath164 , @xmath165 and an angle @xmath166 . for highly deformed 1d - tori",
    "we used up to @xmath167 coefficients .    on every invariant 1d curve with longitudinal frequency @xmath168 one",
    "has @xmath169 where @xmath0 denotes the map  .",
    "thus one can define an error of the approximation by @xmath170 which is evaluated on the grid @xmath171 , @xmath172 . for a fixed @xmath137 a high - dimensional newton search in the coefficients @xmath164 and @xmath165",
    "is used to find zeros of @xmath173 .",
    "we stop the search if an error of @xmath174 is reached where @xmath175 denotes a 10 times finer grid than @xmath176 .",
    "note that the invariant curve described by @xmath138 is the same object as @xmath177 for any @xmath178 .",
    "to get rid of this freedom , one needs to add a uniqueness condition .",
    "as we want to visualize the 1d - tori in a 3d phase - space slice with @xmath34 , we use @xmath151 as this condition .    for the newton search an initial guess for the coefficients @xmath164 , @xmath165 and the longitudinal frequency @xmath137",
    "is needed .",
    "if at least one 1d - torus of a family of 1d - tori is known , an initial guess for a close - by 1d - torus of this family can be obtained by extrapolating within the ( @xmath179)-dimensional space spanned by @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath137 . as continuation parameter the euclidian distance in this space",
    "is used  @xcite .",
    "then , the whole family can be computed using a predictor - corrector continuation .",
    "thus , the crucial task is to either find an initial 1d - torus of the family and compute its fourier coefficients or to obtain a guess for the fourier coefficients from geometric considerations .",
    "this is described in the following by three approaches :    \\(i ) the first approach is to start from 2d - tori and apply the geometric contraction method  @xcite to obtain elliptic 1d - tori .",
    "this is particularly useful as it allows for obtaining 1d - tori beyond bends and large gaps where a direct continuation method usually fails .",
    "\\(ii ) for families attached at ee or eh periodic points @xmath180 one can use each pair of elliptic eigenvalues @xmath181 and the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath182 of the linearized map at the periodic point to define an initial guess , i.e.  @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath186 with small @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "\\(iii ) the previous two approaches do not work for families of hyperbolic 1d - tori arising from bifurcations . for bifurcations with odd @xmath189 these families",
    "are computed by extrapolating the elliptic branches through the main family , see .",
    "for even @xmath189 we use the following approach  @xcite : from it is known that the longitudinal frequencies of the new elliptic and hyperbolic families match .",
    "thus , we can choose a rational value @xmath190 in their frequency range and find the corresponding eh or hh @xmath8-periodic orbit which is embedded in the hyperbolic family according to . as these periodic orbits roughly lie on a 1d - torus , we approximate a nearby 1d - torus by an ellipse using the mean of the periodic points @xmath191 and two of the periodic points @xmath192 and @xmath193 , i.e.  @xmath194 , @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 with small @xmath198 , @xmath199 , and @xmath200 .",
