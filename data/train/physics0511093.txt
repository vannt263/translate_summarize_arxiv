    "ardm detector currently under construction is a wimp detector prototype based on argon bi - phase technology , see @xcite . in this detector ,",
    "the detection of the 128 nm argon scintillation light as well as a localized charge readout allow discrimination against gamma / beta backgrounds .",
    "a major goal of the project is the proof of scalability of such technology to large target masses .",
    "ardm is aiming to be among the first large direct dark matter detectors , with a target mass of the order of one metric ton . in the last two years",
    "extensive r@xmath2d has been conducted towards the achievement of this goal .",
    "this included investigation of the possibility to reflect vuv photons on al coated mylar foils as a means of light collection . for light detection purposes , the feasibility of using large area avalanche photodiodes ( laapd ) for light",
    "read - out was analyzed .",
    "this talk presents the results of the measurement of the quantum efficiency of such devices .",
    "noble gases are known to provide scintillation light with high yield , up to about 50 photons per kev electron equivalent .",
    "detection of this light proves fundamental in many applications in which noble gas is used as medium .",
    "difficulties arise from the fact that noble gas emission is peaked in the vacuum ultraviolet ( vuv ) range .",
    "to detect such light , wavelength shifter - coated photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) have often been used , resulting in a low global quantum efficiency , typically @xmath3 .",
    "there is interest in knowing if laapds could be a viable alternative , in particular in applications where the radiopurity is a concern .",
    "the presented results show that it is in principle possible both to collect vuv light using mirrors , as well as to detect gas scintillation from kr , xe and ar with apds at a quantum efficiency significantly higher than with pmts .",
    "the issues related to the signal to noise of apds , to the parallel operation of a large number of apds to increase the sensitive area , and the mechanical problems at potential cryogenic temperatures are not addressed in this paper .",
    "in our experimental setup ( see figure  [ fig : setup ] ) , we detect argon gas scintillation light with an laapd mounted on an axis perpendicular to the trajectory of alpha particles .",
    "the alpha particles pass from the open @xmath4am source to a second apd employed as a trigger .",
    "the setup for quantum efficiency measurements is described in more detail in  @xcite .",
    "alpha particles pass from the source to an apd serving as trigger .",
    "a laterally mounted apd measures the scintillation light emitted along the trajectory .",
    "a vuv reflecting mirror may be placed at a desired angle , enhancing the signal.,width=240 ]    the apds are advanced photonix laapds with an active diameter of 16 mm @xcite . for scintillation light detection",
    "a windowless , duv - enhanced device was used primarily , cross - checked against a windowless red / ir - enhanced device .    at the gas pressures used ,",
    "the decay time of the argon scintillation signal is of the order of several microseconds  @xcite .",
    "long shaping times allow full integration of the complete signal .    measuring the current flowing through the apd",
    "allows the gain to be monitored according to the method described in @xcite , where a led situated inside the dewar serves as a continuous light source .    for the reflectivity measurements presented in section  [ refl ] , a vuv reflecting mirror ( also shown in figure  [ fig : setup ] ) may be placed at a desired angle , enhancing the signal . via a mechanical feed - through ,",
    "the mirror angle may be set to values between @xmath5 and @xmath6 degrees , where @xmath7 is defined as the angle between the mirror plane and the alpha trajectory .",
    "the setup for reflectivity measurements is described in more detail in  @xcite .",
    "the gases used in this work- ar , kr , and xe- emit photons around 128 nm , 150 nm , and 175 nm , respectively . the vuv photon production mechanism in argon and other noble gases",
    "is known , see for example  @xcite and citations therein / thereof .",
    "accordingly , the average energy expenditure for the emission of a vuv scintillation photon in pure argon gas is @xmath8 67.9  ev .",
    "similarly , for krypton and xenon , @xmath8 61.2  ev and 55.9  ev , respectively ( see appendix ) .    the @xmath9 s trajectory in our setup is well defined due to collimation .",
    "given the gas temperature and pressure , the energy loss of the @xmath9 along its trajectory can then computed  @xcite .",
    "the number of vuv photons created and emitted into the solid angle subtended by the laapd can be simulated for an @xmath9 following its trajectory . in the following ,",
    "this number is referred to as @xmath10 .    for the reflectivity measurements of section  [ refl ]",
    ", the simulation additionally computes the number of photons reaching the apd indirectly through specular reflection by the mirror placed at a variable angle @xmath7 .",
    "this value is referred to as @xmath11 .",
    "the simulated ratio of indirect i.e. reflected to direct light is @xmath12 this can then be compared to the measured values .",
    "a number of measurements were performed in argon , krypton , and xenon gas .",
    "the gas pressures were chosen to ensure the alphas depositing sufficient energy in the trigger apd .",
    ".the gain - independent signal normalized to the expected number of vuv photons in argon .",
    "measurements performed using duv - enhanced laapd .",
    "all data was acquired using a shaping time of 10 @xmath13s .",
    "the last line gives the average value of the measurements . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the obtained values agree well with the data given by the manufacturer for xenon and krypton emission wavelengths , see figure  [ qeffdec ] .",
    "in our search for efficient light collection techniques , we included a variable angle vuv reflector in our setup , see figure  [ fig : setup ] .",
    "the reflector consists of a 125  @xmath13 m mylar foil overcoated with 85  nm aluminum and 25  nm mgf@xmath0 to prevent aluminum oxidation .",
    "the aluminum reflector evaporated on flexible mylar foil is overcoated with a 20 nm @xmath14 film to prevent oxidation .",
    "reflectivity measurements were performed by measuring the apd signal height at different mirror angles .",
    "each such measurement was normalized by the signal height at @xmath6 degrees where no reflected light contributes to the signal .",
    "these ratios were compared to the simulated ratios @xmath15 , see figure  [ arefl ] .",
    "foil is in good agreement with simulation for a specular reflectivity of 90@xmath16 at 128 nm.,width=240 ]     foil is in good agreement with the literature value of 90@xmath16 at 128 nm.,width=240 ]    our measured values are consistent with those of @xcite , stating a specular reflectivity of @xmath17 at 128 nm for @xmath18 on a glass substrate ( see figure  [ fig : refl1 ] ) .",
    "vacuum ultraviolet light can be detected by laapds with improved quantum efficiency compared to other means such as wavelength - shifter coated photomultipliers .",
    "figure  [ qeffdec ] summarizes the obtained results for argon , krypton , and xenon .",
    "our measurements are consistent with the manufacturer s data where it is available .",
    "the non - uv correction was only measured for argon . for xenon and krypton",
    "this correction is of illustrative nature only .",
    "since light quenching by remnant impurities in the gas or by remnant air / water in the volume was not considered , the lower limit of @xmath19 is strict while the upper limit is not .    at room temperature ,",
    "single photon counting was not achieved with the device used .",
    "preliminary tests suggest that even at low temperatures the noise associated with this particular device s high capacitance makes single photon detection difficult .",
    "this renders it impractical for the use in ardm .",
    "we do not exclude photon counting possibility with smaller devices of lower capacitance from the same manufacturer , operated at lar temperatures .",
    "the principle of vuv light collection by means of reflecting foils has been shown to work .",
    "the fact that the foils are flexible makes them a very handy tool for all liquid noble gas experiments .",
    "applications include the construction of winston cones or other light concentrators .",
    "the average energy expended per ion pair @xmath21 can be related to the ionization potential @xmath22 @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the number of ions produced at an average energy expenditure of @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the number of excited atoms produced at an average expenditure of @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the average kinetic energy of escape electrons",
    ".    equation [ eq : wgi ] is energy dependent in all four terms , however , for @xmath29 this dependence is weak . for @xmath9-particles in argon , @xmath30  ev at energies @xmath31  mev . for @xmath32  mev ,",
    "the value is only somewhat higher at @xmath33  ev , increasing further as the kinetic energy is reduced .",
    "our measurements were performed in a pressure range where the scintillation is brought forth by @xmath9 particles with at least 0.5  mev kinetic energy .    assuming no ionization contribution to uv scintillation light , justified at the low pressures used in this work  @xcite , the average energy expenditure per photon is @xmath34 electron volts . substituting equation  [ eq : wgi ] in equation",
    "[ eq : wg ] gives @xmath35 the values of @xmath21 and @xmath36 can be obtained from  @xcite , giving @xmath37 ev , @xmath38 ev , and @xmath39 ev for ar , kr , and xe , respectively .",
    "using the data listed in table [ tab : arir ] , we can give a strict lower limit for the branching ratio @xmath41 of the emission of non - uv photons in argon .",
    "the number of non - uv photons impinging on the red / ir - enhanced laapd relates to the detected charge signal in linear dependence of gain and quantum efficiency : @xmath42 the expression is minimized by the maximum quantum efficiency of the red / ir - enhanced apd , giving the expression @xmath43 where @xmath44 was used .    by comparison with @xmath20 ( see equation  [ eq : wgtr ] ) , the obtained value can be translated into @xmath45 a strict upper limit for the average amount of energy needed to produce a non - uv photon in argon gas around this pressure .",
    "with the data in table [ tab : arir ] , the quantum efficiency of the duv - enhanced laapd for radiation at 128 nm can be calculated more precisely . in equation",
    "[ eq : eqcal ] , the measured charge signal @xmath47 ( see table [ tab : ar ] ) is actually the sum @xmath48 of the vuv contribution and of the non - uv contribution , both weighted with the quantum efficiency of the duv - enhanced apd at the respective wavelength .",
    "the equation can be rewritten as @xmath49 and @xmath50    the value of the ratio @xmath51 is contained in an interval given by the measurements in table  [ tab : arir ] in a similar way as was done in equation  [ eq : ir ] .",
    "thus , a strict lower limit , @xmath52 and , as an upper limit @xmath53 can be given , superindices denoting which apd the quantum efficiency refers to , subindices labelling measurements from the right most column of tables  [ tab : ar ]  and  [ tab : arir ] . in the above equations ,",
    "the extrema of the ratio @xmath54 of the quantum efficiencies of the two laapd types used can be obtained from the manufacturer s data sheet on an interval from 270 nm to 1050 nm .",
    "this gives @xmath55 where the upper limit is not rigorous as quenching effects due to gas impurities have not been accounted for .",
    "if argon non - uv emission is centered around 940 nm as measured by @xcite , this would result in an in - between value of @xmath56 .",
    "note that over a large region of the ir spectrum , the ratio of @xmath57 is relatively constant , making @xmath58 relatively insensitive to the exact wavelength of peak ir emission .",
