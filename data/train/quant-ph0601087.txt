    "entangled photon - pairs are a critical resource for realizing various quantum information protocols , such as quantum teleportation , quantum cryptography , database searching , clock synchronization , and quantum computing  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the efficient generation and distribution of quantum entanglement is of prime importance .",
    "the vast majority of entangled - photon sources that are in use in various laboratories around the world today rely on spontaneous parametric down conversion in @xmath1 crystals  @xcite .",
    "however , formidable engineering challenges remain in coupling the entangled photons into standard optical fibers  @xcite for transmission , storage , and manipulation over long distances .",
    "therefore , an efficient and compact entangled photon - pair source created from the fiber itself and emitting entangled photon - pairs in the low - loss 1550 nm telecom band is desirable .",
    "recently , fiber based sources of entangled photon - pairs have been developed by exploiting the @xmath2 ( kerr ) nonlinearity of the fiber  @xcite .",
    "when the pump wavelength is close to the zero - dispersion wavelength of the fiber , phase - matching is achieved and the probability amplitude for inelastic four - photon scattering ( fps ) is significantly enhanced . in this process ,",
    "two pump photons at frequency @xmath3 scatter through the kerr nonlinearity of the fiber to create an energy - time entangled signal and idler photon - pair at frequencies @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , such that @xmath6 .",
    "because of the isotropic nature of the kerr nonlinearity in fused - silica - glass fiber , the scattered , correlated photon - pairs are predominantly co - polarized with the pump photons . by coherently adding two such orthogonally - polarized fps processes ,",
    "polarization entanglement has been created as well  @xcite .",
    "using such a fiber based source , storage and long - distance distribution of polarization entanglement over 50 km of standard single - mode fiber with negligible decoherence has also been recently presented  @xcite , which demonstrates the viability of all - fiber sources for use in quantum memories and quantum logic gates . however , for the polarization entangled photon - pair source reported in ref .  , the relative phase between the two relatively delayed pump pulses needed to be tracked and locked in order to obtain a stable entangled state for the photon - pairs , which made the system somewhat complicated . on the other hand , such phase locking is not needed for the source reported in refs .   and  , in which a loop of dispersion - shifted fiber ( dsf ) connected to the two output ports of a polarization beam splitter ( pbs ) is simultaneously pumped from clockwise ( cw ) and counter - clockwise ( ccw ) directions with two orthogonally - polarized pump pulses . in this scheme ,",
    "polarization entanglement is produced by a coherent combination of the two fps processes induced by the cw and ccw propagating pump pulses .",
    "more importantly , this setup has two additional advantages : i ) the cross - polarized spontaneous raman scattering ( rs ) , which is a source of background photons , is automatically suppressed  @xcite and ii ) the correlated photon - pairs generated via fps from both the cw and ccw pumps emerge in the forward direction , whereas half of the photon - pairs generated by each of the two pump pulses are lost in the backward direction in the sagnac - loop scheme of ref .  .",
    "despite the relative pros and cons of the two schemes  @xcite , the fiber - based sources demonstrated thus far have been quite inefficient for several reasons .",
    "firstly , the quality of the generated entanglement  @xcite has been limited by the extraneously scattered background photons , whose origin is two - fold : i ) spontaneous raman scattering from the pump pulses causes uncorrelated stokes ( anti - stokes ) photons to be emitted in the signal ( idler ) bands ; ii ) broadening of the pump - pulse spectrum due to self - phase modulation ( spm ) in the fiber causes pump photons to leak into the signal / idler bands .",
    "secondly , the quantum correlation of the photon - pairs produced via fps has not been maximized for lack of careful consideration of the differences in the spectral shape of the pulsed pump and that of the filters used in the signal and idler bands  @xcite .",
    "finally , the filters used to isolate the pumps [ free - space gratings , fiber bragg gratings ( fbgs ) , and array waveguide gratings ( awgs ) ] , have been quite lossy resulting in a low rate for the generated entangled photon - pairs .    in this paper",
    ", using a scheme similar to that reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , we demonstrate an optical - fiber source of polarization entangled photon - pairs with improved quality and efficiency , which has been integrated with off - the - shelf telecom components and is , therefore , well suited for quantum communication applications in the 1550 nm telecom band .",
    "the quality of the source is improved by carefully optimizing the experimental parameters in order to suppress the contamination due to rs and spm of the pump pulses and to maximize the correlation of the signal - idler photon - pairs produced via fps .",
    "the efficiency of the source is improved by using cascaded wdm filters ( cwdmf ) that not only isolate the pump with lesser loss but also improve the correlation of the generated signal - idler photon - pairs because of their squarish ( super - gaussian ) shape .",
    "we characterize the source by experimentally investigating two - photon interference ( tpi ) between the generated signal - idler photon - pairs under various conditions .",
    "tpi with visibility @xmath0% is obtained without subtracting counts caused by the background photons ( only dark counts of the detectors are subtracted ) , while no interference is observed in direct detection of either the signal or the idler photons .",
    "all four bell states can be created with our source .",
    "a schematic of our experimental setup is shown in fig .  [ setup](a ) .",
    "signal and idler photon - pairs at wavelengths of 1533.9 nm and 1543.5 nm , respectively , are produced via the fps process in a 300 m piece of dsf having a zero - dispersion wavelength at @xmath7 nm .",
    "pump pulses with a central wavelength of 1538.7 nm are decomposed into horizontally and vertically polarized components , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , by use of a polarization beam splitter ( pbs ) p@xmath10 and launched into the dsf .",
    "@xmath8 propagates cw in the dsf producing correlated photon - pairs @xmath11 , whereas @xmath9 propagates ccw producing @xmath12 . a fiber polarization controller ( fpc )",
    "is used with the dsf to compensate the birefringence introduced by bending and coiling of the fiber on a spool .",
    "it takes about 2@xmath13s for a pump pulse to propagate through the loop formed by the dsf and p@xmath10 .",
    "for such a short time period , the pump pulses @xmath8 and @xmath9 , launched simultaneously into the loop in cw and ccw directions , can be viewed as propagating along a frozen path , irrespective of the local environmental perturbations , acoustic and thermal , which occur on millisecond time scales .",
    "the correlated wave packets @xmath14 and @xmath15 also see a similar frozen path and are coherently superimposed upon arrival at p@xmath10 . for a photon - pair emerging at the output port of p@xmath10 , there is no way to determine whether it was created by the cw ( horizontally polarized ) or the ccw ( vertically polarized ) pulse [ see fig .  [ setup](a ) ] .",
    "this indistinguishability gives rise to polarization entanglement , resulting in the output state @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the relative phase difference between the wave packets @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in our experiment @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the relative phase between @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "this source can produce all four polarization - entangled bell states . when @xmath22 , the states @xmath23 are created",
    ". in our setup , @xmath24 is obtained by launching a linearly polarized pump pulse and then using a half - wave plate ( hwp@xmath25 ) to rotate the polarization direction to @xmath26 relative to p@xmath10 .",
    "additionally , when a quarter - wave plate ( qwp@xmath25 ) with its axis parallel to p@xmath10 is placed right after hwp@xmath25 , then @xmath27 is achieved . the other two bell states latexmath:[$|\\phi^\\pm\\rangle",
    "= |h\\rangle_s |v\\rangle_i \\pm    oriented hwp in the idler channel .",
    "non - maximally entangled pure states having an arbitrary degree of polarization entanglement can also be created with this setup by choosing the two pump pulses ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) to have unequal powers , which can be accomplished by rotating the hwp@xmath25 .",
    "polarization entanglement is measured by using polarization analyzers ( pas ) [ each composed of a rotatable half - wave plate ( hwp ) and a pbs , see fig .",
    "[ setup](b ) ] in the signal and idler channels . for the state @xmath29 ,",
    "when the polarization analyzers in the signal and idler channels are set to @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , the single - count probability for the signal and idler photons is @xmath32 @xmath33 .",
    "the coincidence - count probability @xmath34 can then be expressed as @xmath35 $ ] , where @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) is the total detection efficiency , @xmath38 ( @xmath37 ) is the angle of the pa in each channel , @xmath39 is the photon - pair production rate , and @xmath40 is a coefficient determined by the spectrum of the pump pulse and that of the filters in the signal and idler bands .    to detect the scattered photon - pairs with good signal - to - noise ,",
    "an isolation of the pump photons in excess of 100db is required . because of the non - zero response time of the kerr nonlinearity  @xcite , there are actually three kinds of photons that emerge from the output port [ see fig .",
    "[ setup](a ) ] : ( i ) entangled signal and idler photon - pairs produced by the fps process ; ( ii ) photons in the signal and idler bands produced by the rs process ; and ( iii ) residual pump photons that leak into the signal and idler bands because of spectral broadening caused by spm .",
    "since the kerr nonlinearity is relatively weak , for 300 m of dsf only about 0.1 photons on average are scattered by a typical 5-ps - duration pump pulse containing approximately @xmath41 photons .",
    "we achieve the required isolation by sending all the photons emerging from the output port through a specially made filter f , which is realized in two ways .",
    "in one configuration ( dgfawg ) , f is composed of a double - grating filter ( dgf ) , providing an isolation greater than 75db  @xcite , followed by array - waveguide - gratings ( awgs ) ( wavesplitter , model wam-10 - 40-g ) , providing isolation greater than 40db  @xcite , wherein the passband of the dgfawg is determined by both the passband of the dgf and that of the channel used in the awg .",
    "the second configuration of f ( cwdmf ) is composed of two cascaded wdm filters ( jdsu , models dws-2f2863p90 and dws-2f3353p90 ) , each one providing an isolation greater than 70db in each channel .",
    "the two configurations are schematically shown in figs .",
    "[ setup](b ) and  [ setup](c ) , respectively , and their transmission spectra are plotted in fig .",
    "[ spectra](a ) .",
    "each passband of dgfawg fits a gaussian function well with a full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 0.4 nm , as shown in fig .",
    "[ spectra](b ) .",
    "in contrast , each passband of cwdmf is well fitted with a forth - order super - gaussian function having a fwhm of 1 nm , as shown in fig .",
    "[ spectra](c ) . the dynamic range of the spectra shown in fig .  [ spectra ] is limited by the intrinsic noise of the optical spectrum analyzer ( osa ) used to make the measurements .",
    "the total isolation to out - of - band pump photons provided by the filter f in both configurations is greater than 110db .",
    "the pump is a 5-ps - duration mode - locked pulse train with a repetition rate of @xmath42mhz , obtained by spatially dispersing the output of an optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) ( coherent , model mira - opo ) with a diffraction grating  @xcite . to achieve the required power ,",
    "the pump pulses are then amplified by an erbium - doped fiber amplifier ( edfa ) .",
    "photons at the signal and idler wavelengths  from the opo that leak through the spectral - dispersion optics and from the amplified spontaneous emission in the edfa  are suppressed by passing the pump through a 1nm - bandwidth tunable filter ( newport , model tbf-1550 - 1.0 ) . in our experiment , the spectrum of pump pulses is well fitted with a gaussian function of 0.8 nm fwhm , as shown in fig .  [ spectra](d ) .",
    "the signal and idler photons are detected with photon counters consisting of ingaas / inp avalanche photodiodes ( apds ) ( epitaxx , model epm 239ba ) operated in a gated - geiger mode  @xcite .",
    "the 1-ns - wide gate pulses arrive at a rate of @xmath43khz , which is @xmath44 of the repetition rate of the pump pulses .",
    "the quantum efficiency for one detector is @xmath45 , for the other is 20% .",
    "the total detection efficiencies for the signal and idler photons are about @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 with cwdmf ) , respectively , when the efficiencies of the dsf ( @xmath50 ) , dgfawg ( @xmath51 ) [ cwdmf ( @xmath52 ) ] , and other transmission components ( about @xmath50 ) are included . for the cwdmf , an efficiency of @xmath53",
    "should also be included when pas are inserted .",
    "our first measurement for characterizing the polarization correlation of the source involves setting both pas at @xmath54 and slowly scanning the relative phase @xmath21 between @xmath8 and @xmath9 while observing the photon counts , both singles and coincidences .",
    "phase scanning is accomplished by adding separate free - space propagation paths for @xmath8 and @xmath9 with use of a pbs ( p@xmath55 ) , two quarter - wave plates ( qwp@xmath56 and qwp@xmath57 ) , and two mirrors ( m@xmath56 and m@xmath57 ) [ see fig .",
    "[ setup](d ) ] .",
    "m@xmath57 is mounted on a piezoelectric - transducer-(pzt)-driven translation stage , which allows us to precisely adjust the free - space path difference and hence the relative phase @xmath21 .",
    "for this measurement , the pump powers for both @xmath8 and @xmath9 are about 0.3mw and the dgfawg is used to reject the pump . during the measurement , the phase @xmath21 is simultaneously monitored by tapping off the rejected pump with a mirror m@xmath10 placed after the grating g@xmath10 and measuring it with a low - bandwidth photodetector d@xmath10 placed behind a polarizer p@xmath56 .",
    "this arrangement is equivalent to monitoring one output port of the polarization interferometer formed between p@xmath10 and p@xmath56 [ see fig .  [ setup](b ) ] .",
    "the fringe contrast of the interfering @xmath8 and @xmath9 pulses is maximized by appropriately adjusting the position of m@xmath57 ( by applying an appropriate voltage on the pzt ) and the orientations of hwp@xmath10 and qwp@xmath10 .",
    "this ensures that @xmath8 and @xmath9 arrive at @xmath58 simultaneously , and that the rejected @xmath8 and @xmath9 are oriented at @xmath59 relative to the axis of p@xmath56 .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ interference1](a ) , where one sees good interference in the coincidence counts whereas no interference is observed in the single counts . in plotting the coincidence",
    "counts only the dark counts of the detectors have been subtracted . by fitting the plotted coincidence counts with a cosine function",
    ", we obtain a tpi visibility of @xmath60 .",
    "these results are obtained at a production rate of 0.1 photons / pulse , which is deduced from the detected single counts , and among them the photon - pair production rate is about 0.07 pairs / pulse .",
    "the output of d@xmath10 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ interference1](b ) , which when compared with the tpi result shown in fig .",
    "[ interference1](a ) clearly shows that the relative phase @xmath17 between the wave packets @xmath14 and @xmath61 is twice the pump phase @xmath62 , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "it is worth noting that when the pump power is higher , slight variations also begin to appear in the single counts , with the variation in signal band being more than that in idler band .",
    "this is also shown in fig .",
    "[ interference1](b ) , which was obtained with pump powers for both @xmath8 and @xmath9 to be about @xmath63mw . fitting the single counts with a cosine function , we find that the periodicity in the single - count variations is the same as that of the pump , but the phases are different . for the signal counts the fringe maximum occurs behind that of the pump by about 2 radians , while for the idler counts it is ahead of the pump maximum by the same amount of phase shift .",
    "we see a similar behavior upon further increasing the pump power ; only the magnitude of the variations in the single counts is increased .",
    "we believe that the spm of the pump is responsible for the observed variations in the single counts .",
    "although the isolation provided by the filter f ( dgfawg for the data in fig .  [ interference1 ] ) is good enough to effectively reject the pump photons at the central wavelength , the spm induced spectral broadening of the pump pulses at higher powers causes pump photons at the signal and idler passband frequencies to leak through the filter f. these leakage photons give rise to first - order interference observed in the single counts .",
    "one way to reduce the influence of the spm , is to increase the detuning of the signal band from the pump .",
    "however , the detuning needs to be decreased to suppress the rs in the dsf  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we improve the quality of our source by optimizing the system parameters such that the rs and spm are suppressed while the correlation of the photon - pairs produced by the fps is maximized , in accordance with our measurements of these effects in refs .  , and  .",
    "thus , we replace the gaussian - shaped dgfawg with a fwhm of 0.4 nm by the supper - gaussian  shaped cwdmf with a fwhm of 1 nm . additionally , because the loss of each wdm used to construct the cwdmf is only about 0.5db , the efficiency of the source is significantly improved .    with the optimized configuration of the system , we measure the tpi again with pump powers of @xmath8 and @xmath9 at about @xmath64mw each . blocking the light reflected from m@xmath56 and adjusting hwp@xmath25 to @xmath65",
    "relative to p@xmath10 ( see fig .  [ setup ] ) , we obtain a pump which is linearly polarized with an angle of @xmath26 relative to p@xmath10 . in making the measurement , the qwp@xmath25 is either taken out or oriented with its axis parallel to that of the hwp@xmath25 . in this way we set @xmath66 so that the two - particle quantum state emerging from the output port is @xmath67 .",
    "tpi measurements are made by fixing the pa in the signal channel at @xmath26 while rotating the pa in the idler channel .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ interference2 ] , wherein only the dark counts of the detectors have been subtracted .",
    "these results are obtained for a production rate of about 0.02 photons / pulse ( deduced from the single - count measurements ) , among which the photon - pair production rate is about 0.006 pairs / pulse .",
    "clearly , we observe much improved tpi , while the single counts in both the channels remain constant . again by fitting the coincidence counts with a cosine function , a tpi visibility of @xmath68 is obtained .    for comparison",
    ", we increase the pump powers of @xmath8 and @xmath9 to about 0.15mw and make the tpi measurement again . under this condition , we obtain a deduced production rate of about 0.13 photons / pulse , among which the photon - pair production rate is about 0.07 pairs / pulse .",
    "thus , at the same photon - pair production rate as in fig .  [ interference1 ] , the rs in this case is larger . and",
    "yet , we observe tpi with a higher visibility of about 78% than the visibility of 71% in fig .",
    "[ interference1 ] .",
    "this increase in visibility is because the correlation of the detected photons produced via fps is maximized by using a super - gaussian filter such as the cwdmf with a wider and flat passband .",
    "we have demonstrated a high - quality source of polarization entangled photon - pairs by using a counter propagating scheme in which an optical - fiber loop is simultaneously pumped with orthogonally polarized pulses in clockwise and counter - clockwise directions .",
    "we produce high - quality photon - pairs by carefully optimizing the system parameters in order to suppress the negative effects of raman scattering and self - phase modulation of the pump pulses , and to maximize the photon - pair correlation through the four - photon scattering process .",
    "the source is integrated with off - the - shelf telecom components and is , therefore , well suited for quantum communication applications in the 1550 nm telecom band .",
    "we have characterized the source by investigating two - photon interference between the generated signal - idler photon - pairs under various experimental conditions . at a production rate of about 0.02 photons / pulse in the signal ( idler ) channel , two - photon interference with visibility @xmath0%",
    "is obtained without subtracting counts caused by the background photons ( only dark counts of the detectors are subtracted ) , while no interference is observed in direct detection of either the signal or the idler photons .",
    "all four bell states can be created with this source .",
    "the results can be significantly improved by cooling the fiber to further suppress the raman scattering . moreover , the free - space components of the present setup can be replaced with commercially available fiber - spliced components , which would make the source very compact and easily integrable into the existing fiber network .",
