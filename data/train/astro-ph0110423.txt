    "the scutum region near @xmath6 is in the tangential line of sight of a galactic arm ( the scutum arm ) , and hence shows intensity excesses in the infrared , radio and @xmath7-ray regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) as well as diffuse x - rays ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this region is also rich in x - ray binary sources ; many transient x - ray sources have also been discovered ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . from the spectral and flux variability",
    ", these x - ray transients are suspected to be either neutron - star binaries with high mass or low - mass stars , or black - hole binaries ( @xcite ) .",
    "coherent x - ray pulsations have been found from some of them , suggesting be / x - ray binaries .    among them , an unusual source is ax  1845.0@xmath00433 , which exhibited violent flares with a very rapid rise time of @xmath8  s ( @xcite ) .",
    "apart from the unusual flares , other characteristics are similar to those of high - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "in fact , @xcite reported an o9.5 star as the optical counterpart of ax  1845.0@xmath00433 . nevertheless , no coherent pulsation has been found .    in the asca survey and pointing observations on the scutum arm region , we found another unusual source , ax  j1841.0@xmath00536 , which also exhibited violent and rapid flares @xcite .",
    "this paper reports on a detailed analysis of this new transient x - ray source , particularly on the detection of coherent pulsations and phase resolved spectral analyses .",
    "the first asca observation of a region around @xmath9 was made on 1994 april 12 , or mjd 49454.67749454.701 , as a part of the scutum arm survey project ( hereinafter , obs .  1 ) .",
    "a longer exposure follow - up observation was made on 1999 october 34 , or on mjd 51454.25251455.463 ( obs .  2 ) .",
    "asca carried four xrts ( x - ray telescopes , @xcite ) with two giss ( gas imaging spectrometers , @xcite ) and two siss ( solid - state imaging spectrometers , @xcite ) on the focal planes .",
    "since our target was out of the sis field in both observations , we do not refer to the sis in this paper .",
    "the giss were operated in the nominal ph mode with a time resolution of 62.5  ms ( high bit - rate ) or 0.5  s ( medium bit - rate ) .",
    "we rejected the gis data obtained in the south atlantic anomaly , in low cut - off rigidity regions ( @xmath10  gv ) , or when the target s elevation angle was low ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "particle events were removed by the rise - time discrimination method @xcite .",
    "after these screenings , the total available exposure times of obs .  1 and 2 were @xmath12  ks and @xmath13  ks , respectively . to increase the statistics ,",
    "the data of the two detectors , gis-2 and gis-3 , were combined in a following study .",
    "a transient source is found in both obs .  1 and obs",
    ".  2 . figure  [ figure1 ] shows a point - like source image located near the galactic plane .",
    "the source position is determined by the method of @xcite and is ( r.a .",
    ", dec.)@xmath14 = ( , @xmath0 ) with an uncertainty of @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , we designate this source as ax  j1841.0@xmath00536 ( this source was at first named ax  j1841.0@xmath00535.8 based on less - accurate positioning ; @xcite ) .",
    "no x - ray source has been found within the error region in the simbad database . however , this source is in an error region @xmath16 of a previous x - ray transient ( the ginga source no .  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "( 70mm,70mm)figure1.ps      ( 90mm,150mm)figure2.ps    the light curves of ax  j1841.0@xmath00536 in both observations are shown in figure  [ figure2 ] .",
    "the x - ray flux is highly variable with two flares of the on - set epochs at mjd 51454.7 and mjd 51455.3 with an interval of only @xmath17  d. as can be seen in figure  [ figure2 ] , the flares are found in the hard bands , while the soft band fluxes are essentially constant .",
    "a remarkable fact is that the on - set time of both the flares are extremely rapid ; the fluxes increased by one order of magnitude within 1  hr .    to study the time evolution , we divided obs .  2 into three epochs : obs .",

    "2c ( mjd 51455.30051455.463 ) , as shown in figure  [ figure2 ] .",
    "we then performed detailed timing analyses of the brightest flare episode ( obs .  2c ) .",
    "we extracted @xmath18  photons , including @xmath19 background photons , in the 1.94.9  kev band from a 3@xmath20 radius circle around the source ( the solid circle in figure 1 ) , corrected the photon arrival times to those at the barycenter and applied an fft ( fast fourier transform ) algorithm .",
    "the resulting power - density spectrum , figure  [ figure3 ] ( left ) , shows a peak at @xmath1 0.211  hz . with 13471 frequencies examined ,",
    "the chance probability of producing such a large peak is @xmath21 , and hence the 0.211  hz oscillation is highly significant .",
    "we next performed an epoch - folding search and determined a more accurate pulse period of @xmath22  s. figure  [ figure3 ] ( right ) shows the folded pulse profile in the soft ( 1.94.9  kev ) and hard ( 4.910.0  kev ) bands .",
    "the pulse shapes are sinusoidal in both energy bands , but the background - subtracted pulse fraction is larger in the soft ( 28% ) band than in the hard ( 8% ) band .",
    "although same analyses , fft and epoch folding , were performed for the other data sets , no significant power was found with the @xmath23 upper limit of the background - subtracted pulse fraction in the soft band of about 45% and 12% for obs .",

    "( 70mm,50mm)figure3a.ps ( 70mm,50mm)figure3b.ps      we made time - sliced x - ray spectra using photons from the same region of the timing analysis ( in the 3@xmath20 radius circle around the source ; see figure 1 ) .",
    "the contribution of the galactic ridge emission is not negligible for ax  j1841.0@xmath00536 located closely on the galactic plane at @xmath24 .",
    "contamination from an unidentified hard diffuse source g26.6@xmath00.1 ( a. bamba et al .",
    "unpublished ) and vignetting may not be ignored .",
    "we thus made the background spectrum by adding data from two source - free regions , indicated by the dotted - circles in figure  [ figure1 ] .",
    "these two regions were selected to compensate for the latitude - dependent galactic ridge emission @xcite and contamination of g26.6@xmath00.1 .",
    "the vignetting is also the same as the source region .    the background - subtracted spectrum in the brightest flare phase ( the second flare , or obs .",
    "2c ) was at first fitted with a power - law function .",
    "the absorption column was estimated from the cross sections of morrison and mccammon ( 1983 ) with solar abundances .",
    "although this model is statistically acceptable , we see a systematic data excess at around 67  kev . adding a narrow gaussian line to the model reduced the @xmath25 from 51.2/52 to 43.2/50 ( @xmath25/degree of freedom ) ; thus",
    ", the presence of the line is significant .",
    "the center energy of the line is @xmath26  kev ( hereinafter , the errors are of 90% confidence level , unless otherwise mentioned ) , implying that the line is due to neutral or low - ionized irons .",
    "an absorbed thin - thermal plasma model fitting , on the other hand , requires unrealistically high temperature of @xmath27 80  kev , and is hence unlikely .",
    "we then fit the background - subtracted spectra of the other epochs with a power - law plus a gaussian model , fixing the center energy of the line to be 6.40  kev ( the best - fit value in obs .",

    "ax  j1841.0@xmath00536 is in the error region @xmath47 of a previous x - ray transient no .  2 in @xcite .",

    "therefore these two transients are likely to be the same source . from the flux history",

    "more bright flares of a level of @xmath51 are , however not frequent .",
    "although the limited statistics allows a constant - value hypothesis of @xmath49 , we see a hint that @xmath49 increase with increasing flux , which suggests that the circum - stellar absorption becomes larger in the flare , due to the larger gas accretion .",
    "therefore , the interstellar absorption should be regarded as the minimum value of @xmath52 ( obs .  1 and obs .",
    "the large error of @xmath49 does not allow us to reliably estimate the source distance .",
    "nevertheless , we simply estimate the distance to ax  j1841.0@xmath00536 to be 1 - 10  kpc , assuming the average density in the galactic plane to be 1 h @xmath53 .",
    "this value is consistent with that the transient source is located in the tangential point of the scutum arm .",
    "@xcite reported many x - ray transient sources in the scutum arm with a flare of the order of @xmath54 , and suggested that most are be / x - ray binaries .",
    "since the hard x - ray spectrum , neutral iron line , erratic flux variability and coherent pulsations are characteristic of be / x - ray binaries , ax  j1841.0@xmath00536 would be a member of this sub - class of x - ray pulsars . no optical counterpart has been found to confirm this classification .",
    "the luminosity is consistent with that of a `` type i outburst '' of be / x - ray binaries @xcite .    from a semi - empirical relation of the orbital period vs. pulse period and the x - ray luminosity ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , we suggest that the orbital period of ax  j1841.0@xmath00536 is @xmath5525  days",

    "4u  1223@xmath062 , @xcite ; v  0332 + 53 , @xcite ) due to a gas surge during passage near to the peri - astron or across the equatorial plane . from ax  j1841.0@xmath00536 ,",
    "we observed two subsequent flares separated by @xmath56 , which is much shorter than not only the predicted orbital period , but also the shortest orbital period known for a be / x - ray binary pulsar , 16.7  days for a0538@xmath066 @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported that quasi - periodic flares with a 3.96 hr interval in the limited episode of a be / x - ray binary exo  2030 + 375 , which has spin and orbital periods of @xmath57  s and 46.0  day respectively @xcite , are both different from the flare interval .",
    "they inferred that the quasi - periodic rapid flares , fast rise and exponential decay , are due to instabilities in the either magnetosphere ( e.g. , @xcite ) or the accretion disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "asymmetric flow of a stellar wind ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or non - homogeneity of the ob star wind ( e.g. , @xcite ) may also be a possible scenario .",
    "the same process can be applied to the two flares of ax  j1841.0@xmath00536 , although the detailed structure , the flare profile , number , size and so on are significantly different from those of exo  2030 + 375 .",
    "a remarkable feature of ax  j1841.0@xmath00536 is an eruptive on - set of a flare with a rise - time of @xmath11  hour .",
    "we note that other transient sources , ax  j1845.0@xmath00433 @xcite and xte  j1739@xmath0302 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , exhibit multiple flares with a fast - rise of a few hours , although no coherent pulsation has been found .",
    "we suspect that these new transients comprise a new sub - class of x - ray binaries , which provides a crucial test for the accretion - flow instability .",
