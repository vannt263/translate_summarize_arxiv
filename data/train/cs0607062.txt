    "this includes both official documents , such as the full text of laws and the proceedings of legislative bodies , and unofficial documents , such as postings on weblogs ( blogs ) devoted to politics . in some sense ,",
    "the availability of such data is simply a manifestation of a general trend of `` everybody putting their records on the internet . ''",
    "the online accessibility of politically oriented texts in particular , however , is a phenomenon that some have gone so far as to say will have a potentially society - changing effect .    in the united states , for example , governmental bodies are providing and soliciting political documents via the internet , with lofty goals in mind : _ electronic rulemaking _ ( erulemaking ) initiatives involving the `` electronic collection , distribution , synthesis , and analysis of public commentary in the regulatory rulemaking process '' ,",
    "may `` [ alter ] the citizen - government relationship '' @xcite .",
    "additionally , much media attention has been focused recently on the potential impact that internet sites may have on politics , or at least on political journalism .",
    "regardless of whether one views such claims as clear - sighted prophecy or mere hype , it is obviously important to help people understand and analyze politically oriented text , given the importance of enabling informed participation in the political process .",
    "evaluative and persuasive documents , such as a politician s speech regarding a bill or a blogger s commentary on a legislative proposal , form a particularly interesting type of politically oriented text .",
    "people are much more likely to consult such evaluative statements than the actual text of a bill or law under discussion , given the dense nature of legislative language and the fact that ( u.s . ) bills often reach several hundred pages in length @xcite .",
    "moreover , political opinions are explicitly solicited in the erulemaking scenario .    in the analysis of evaluative language , it is fundamentally necessary to determine whether the author / speaker supports or disapproves of the topic of discussion . in this paper , we investigate the following specific instantiation of this problem : we seek to determine from the transcripts of u.s .",
    "congressional floor debates whether each `` speech '' ( continuous single - speaker segment of text ) represents support for or opposition to a proposed piece of legislation .",
    "note that from an experimental point of view , this is a very convenient problem to work with because we can automatically determine ground truth ( and thus avoid the need for manual annotation ) simply by consulting publicly available voting records .",
    "[ [ section ] ] +    determining whether or not a speaker supports a proposal falls within the realm of _ sentiment analysis _ , an extremely active research area devoted to the computational treatment of subjective or opinion - oriented language ( early work includes wiebe and rapaport , hearst , sack , and ; see esuli for an active bibliography ) . in particular , since we treat each individual speech within a debate as a single `` document '' , we are considering a version of _ document - level sentiment - polarity classification _ , namely , automatically distinguishing between positive and negative documents @xcite .",
    "most sentiment - polarity classifiers proposed in the recent literature categorize each document independently .",
    "a few others incorporate various measures of inter - document similarity between the texts to be labeled @xcite .",
    "many interesting opinion - oriented documents , however , can be linked through certain relationships that occur in the context of evaluative _",
    "discussions_. for example , we may find textual evidence of a high likelihood of _ agreement _ between two speakers , such as explicit assertions ( `` i second that ! '' ) or quotation of messages in emails or postings ( see but cf . ) .",
    "agreement evidence can be a powerful aid in our classification task : for example , we can easily categorize a complicated ( or overly terse ) document if we find within it indications of agreement with a clearly positive text .",
    "obviously , incorporating agreement information provides additional benefit only when the input documents are relatively difficult to classify individually .",
    "intuition suggests that this is true of the data with which we experiment , for several reasons .",
    "first , u.s .",
    "congressional debates contain very rich language and cover an extremely wide variety of topics , ranging from flag burning to international policy to the federal budget .",
    "debates are also subject to digressions , some fairly natural and others less so ( e.g. , `` why are we discussing this bill when the plight of my constituents regarding this other issue is being ignored ? '' )    second , an important characteristic of persuasive language is that speakers may spend more time presenting evidence in support of their positions ( or attacking the evidence presented by others ) than directly stating their attitudes .",
    "an extreme example will illustrate the problems involved .",
    "consider a speech that describes the u.s .",
    "flag as deeply inspirational , and thus contains only positive language .",
    "if the bill under discussion is a proposed flag - burning ban , then the speech is _ supportive _ ; but if the bill under discussion is aimed at rescinding an existing flag - burning ban , the speech may represent _ opposition _ to the legislation . given the current state of the art in sentiment analysis , it is doubtful that one could determine the ( probably topic - specific ) relationship between presented evidence and speaker opinion .    [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ [ using - relationship - information ] ] using relationship information + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    applying an svm to classify each speech segmentin isolation leads to clear improvements over the two baseline methods , as demonstrated in table [ tab : results - local ] .",
    "when we impose the constraint that all speech segmentsuttered by the same speaker receive the same label via `` same - speaker links '' , both test - set and development - set accuracy increase even more , in the latter case quite substantially so .",
    "the last two lines of table [ tab : results - local ] show that the best results are obtained by incorporating agreement information as well .",
    "the highest test - set result , 71.16% , is obtained by using a high - precision threshold to determine which agreement links to add .",
    "while the development - set results would induce us to utilize the standard threshold value of 0 , which is sub - optimal on the test set , the @xmath0 agreement - link policy still achieves noticeable improvement over not using agreement links ( test set : 70.81% vs. 67.21% ) .",
    "we use speech segmentsas the unit of classification because they represent natural discourse units . as a consequence ,",
    "we are able to exploit relationships at the speech - segmentlevel .",
    "however , it is interesting to consider whether we really need to consider relationships specifically between speech segmentsthemselves , or whether it suffices to simply consider relationships between the _ speakers _ of the speech segments . in particular , as an alternative to using same - speaker links , we tried a _",
    "speaker - based _ approach wherein the way we determine the initial individual - document classification score for each speech segmentuttered by a person @xmath1 in a given debate is to run an svm on the concatenation of _ all _ of @xmath1 s speech segmentswithin that debate .",
    "( we also ensure that agreement - link information is propagated from speech - segment to speaker pairs . )",
    "how does the use of same - speaker links compare to the concatenation of each speaker s speech segments ?",
    "tables [ tab : results - local ] and [ tab : results - global ] show that , not surprisingly , the svm individual - document classifier works better on the concatenated speech segmentsthan on the speech segmentsin isolation",
    ". however , the effect on overall classification accuracy is less clear : the development set favors same - speaker links over concatenation , while the test set does not .",
    "but we stress that the most important observation we can make from table [ tab : results - global ] is that once again , the addition of agreement information leads to substantial improvements in accuracy .",
    "recall that in in our experiments , we created finite - weight agreement links , so that speech segmentsappearing in pairs flagged by our ( imperfect ) agreement detector can potentially receive different labels .",
    "we also experimented with _ forcing _ such speech segmentsto receive the same label , either through infinite - weight agreement links or through a speech - segmentconcatenation strategy similar to that described in the previous subsection .",
    "both strategies resulted in clear degradation in performance on both the development and test sets , a finding that validates our encoding of agreement information as `` soft '' preferences .",
    "we have seen several cases in which the method that performs best on the development set does not yield the best test - set performance .",
    "however , we felt that it would be illegitimate to change the train / development / test sets in a post hoc fashion , that is , after seeing the experimental results .    moreover , and crucially , it is very clear that using agreement information , encoded as preferences within our graph - based approach rather than as hard constraints , yields substantial improvements on both the development and test set ; this , we believe , is our most important finding .",
    "[ [ politically - oriented - text ] ] politically - oriented text + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    sentiment analysis has specifically been proposed as a key enabling technology in erulemaking , allowing the automatic analysis of the opinions that people submit @xcite .",
    "there has also been work focused upon determining the political leaning ( e.g. , `` liberal '' vs. `` conservative '' ) of a document or author , where most previously - proposed methods make no direct use of relationships between the documents to be classified ( the `` unlabeled '' texts ) @xcite .",
    "an exception is , who experimented with determining the political orientation of websites essentially by classifying the concatenation of all the documents found on that site .",
    "others have applied the nlp technologies of near - duplicate detection and topic - based text categorization to politically oriented text @xcite .

    "more sophisticated approaches have been proposed @xcite , including an extension that , in an interesting reversal of our problem , makes use of sentiment - polarity indicators within speech segments@xcite . also relevant",
    "is work on the general problems of dialog - act tagging @xcite , citation analysis @xcite , and computational rhetorical analysis @xcite .",
    "we currently do not have an efficient means to encode _ disagreement _ information as hard constraints ; we plan to investigate incorporating such information in future work .",

    ".    previous sentiment - analysis work in different domains has considered inter - document similarity @xcite or explicit inter - document references in the form of hyperlinks @xcite .",
    "notable early papers on graph - based semi - supervised learning include blum and chawla , bansal , blum , and chawla , kondor and lafferty , and joachims .",
    "zhu maintains a survey of this area .",
    "recently , several alternative , often quite sophisticated approaches to _ collective classification _ have been proposed @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate the application of such methods to our problem .",
    "however , we also believe that our approach has important advantages , including conceptual simplicity and the fact that it is based on an underlying optimization problem that is provably and in practice easy to solve .",
    "in this study , we focused on very general types of cross - document classification preferences , utilizing constraints based only on speaker identity and on direct textual references between statements .",
    "we showed that the integration of even very limited information regarding inter - document relationships can significantly increase the accuracy of support / opposition classification .",
    "the simple constraints modeled in our study , however , represent just a small portion of the rich network of relationships that connect statements and speakers across the political universe and in the wider realm of opinionated social discourse . one intriguing possibility is to take advantage of ( readily identifiable ) information regarding interpersonal relationships , making use of speaker / author affiliations , positions within a social hierarchy , and so on . or , we could even attempt to model relationships between topics or concepts , in a kind of extension of collaborative filtering .",
    "for example , perhaps we could infer that two speakers sharing a common opinion on evolutionary biologist richard dawkins ( a.k.a .",
    "`` darwin s rottweiler '' ) will be likely to agree in a debate centered on intelligent design . while such functionality is well beyond the scope of our current study , we are optimistic that we can develop methods to exploit additional types of relationships in future work .",
