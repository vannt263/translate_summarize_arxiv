    "in classical general relativity , if one wishes to study spacetime properties that hold for a variety of matter sources it is suitable to impose the so - called _ energy conditions _ that limit the arbitrariness of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath9 on physical grounds .",
    "these conditions can be stated in a coordinate - invariant way in terms of @xmath9 and vector fields of fixed character ( timelike , null and spacelike ) . however , within the framework of the standard friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) model , we only need to consider the energy - momentum tensor of a perfect fluid with density @xmath10 and pressure @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath12 so that the energy conditions take one of the following forms  @xcite : @xmath13 where nec , wec , sec and dec correspond , respectively , to the null , weak , strong and dominant energy conditions .",
    "clearly , the ordinary matter in the form of baryons or relativistic particles like photons and neutrinos satisfies these energy conditions .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the energy conditions have been used in different contexts to derive powerful results in a variety of situations .",
    "for example , the hawking - penrose singularity theorems invoke the sec  @xcite , the positive mass theorem assumes the dec  @xcite , while the proof of second law of black hole thermodynamics requires nec  @xcite .    on macroscopic scales relevant for cosmology ,",
    "another important viewpoint is the confrontation of the energy condition predictions with the observational data . in this regard , since the pioneering works by visser  @xcite , it has been shown that the energy conditions provide model - independent bounds on the cosmological observables , and a number of studies involving such bounds have been recently discussed in the literature   ( see also the related refs .",

    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have derived bounds on the distance modulus , @xmath14 , for any spatial curvature @xmath15 , and made a confrontation of the bound predictions with recent type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) data . in refs .",
    "@xcite the confrontation of the nec and sec bounds with a _ combined _ sample of 192 supernovae was carried out providing similar and complementary results .",
    "they have also shown that the violation of _ integrated _ bounds [ such as those on @xmath14 ] at a given redshift @xmath17 ensures the breakdown of the corresponding energy condition , without specifying at what redshift the energy - condition violation took place . in ref .",

    "@xcite .    in this paper , to proceed further with the investigation of the interrelation between energy conditions on scales relevant for cosmology and observational data , we extend and complement the results of refs .",
    "@xcite in three different ways .",
    "first , we show in a simple way that the violation of _ integrated bounds _ such as those on the hubble parameter @xmath22 , on the distance modulus @xmath14  @xcite and on the lookback time @xmath1",
    "@xcite at a redshift @xmath17 is neither necessary nor sufficient _ local condition _ for the breakdown of the associated energy condition  @xcite .",
    "second , we derive _ local _ _ necessary and sufficient _ bounds for the fulfillment of each energy conditions in terms of the deceleration parameter @xmath6 and the normalized hubble function @xmath23 for any spatial curvature .",
    "third , we make the confrontation between our local _ non - integrated bounds _ with statistical estimates [ in the plane @xmath24 by using the sne ia of both the new _ gold _ sample  @xcite , of 182 sne ia and the _ combined _ sample of 192 sne ia  @xcite . in this way",
    ", our necessary and sufficient non - integrated energy - condition bounds allow a statistical confrontation of energy conditions and sne ia data within chosen confidence levels at any given redshift .",
    "in this section we give an account of our basic assumptions , briefly recast the major results of refs .",
    "@xcite , and discuss the nature of the energy - condition _ integrated _ bounds and their limitation in the local confrontation with observational data .",
    "let us begin by recalling that the standard approach to cosmological modelling commences with a space - time manifold endowed with the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric @xmath25,\\ ] ] where the spatial curvature @xmath26 or @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the cosmological scale factor .",
    "the metric  ( [ rwmetric ] ) encodes the assumption that our @xmath29dimensional space is homogeneous and isotropic at sufficiently large scales along with the existence of a cosmic time @xmath30 .",
    "however , to study the dynamics of the universe an additional assumption in this approach to cosmological modelling is necessary , namely , that the large scale structure of the universe is essentially governed by the gravitational interactions , and hence can be described by a metrical theory of gravitation such as general relativity ( gr ) .    these very general premises , which we assume in this work , constrain the cosmological fluid to be a perfect - type fluid of the form  ( [ em - tensor ] ) , with the total density @xmath10 and pressure @xmath11 given by @xmath31\\ ; , \\label{rho - eq } \\\\ p & = & - \\frac{1}{8\\pi g}\\left[\\ , 2\\,\\frac{\\ddot{a}}{a } + \\frac{\\dot{a}^2}{a^2 } + \\frac{k}{a^2 } \\,\\right ] \\ ; , \\label{p - eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where dots denote derivative with respect to the time @xmath30 .    the _ integrated _ bounds on the hubble functions @xmath22 comes from the following set of dynamical constraints : ) ] .",
    "in this way , * nec * , * wec * , * sec * and * dec * refer , respectively , to the following nec , wec , sec and dec inequations : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 . ]",
    "@xmath36 \\geq 0 \\ ; , \\label{dec - eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be easily derived from the energy conditions [ eqs .  ]",
    "along with the above eqs .   and .",
    "in fact , eqs .",
    " can be written in terms of the hubble function , @xmath37 , and its derivatives with respect to the redshift , @xmath38 , as @xmath39 where here and in what follows the subscript @xmath40 stands for present - day quantities .",
    "now , integrating the inequations  , and   in the interval @xmath41 , where we assume that they hold , one obtains the following _ integrated _ bounds on hubble function from the energy conditions : @xmath42}\\ , .",
    "\\nonumber   \\\\ \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we note that the inequation   does not contain derivative of @xmath22 , but clearly for @xmath43 the * wec * restricts the present - day curvature parameter to @xmath44 .",
    "the _ integrated _ bounds provided by the energy conditions on the distance modulus @xmath0 can now be easily obtained from the above bounds on the hubble function as follows .",
    "first , we recall that the distance modulus for an object at redshift @xmath17 is defined by @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are , respectively , the apparent and absolute magnitudes , and @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 for @xmath51 respectively , and @xmath52 = @xmath53 .",
    "second , we substitute eqs .   into eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dl_z ] ) and ( [ eq : mu_z ] ) to obtain the bounds on the distance modulus @xmath0 for any spatial curvature @xmath15 . for the flat flrw model ( @xmath54 ) which we focus our attention on in this paper",
    ", the _ integrated _ bounds reduce to @xmath55 + 25\\;,\\\\ \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{eq : musec } \\mbox{\\bf sec }   & \\rightarrow & \\mu(z ) \\leq 5 \\log_{10 } [ ch_0^{-1 }",
    "( 1 + z )   \\ln(1 + z ) ] + 25 \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ \\\\ \\label{eq : mudec } \\mbox{\\bf dec } & \\rightarrow & \\mu(z ) \\geq 5 \\log_{10 } \\left [ \\frac{ch_0^{-1 } z   ( 2 + z)}{2 ( 1 + z ) } \\right ] + 25 \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    concerning the above bounds on @xmath22 and @xmath14 , we emphasize that the _ nonlocal _ or _ integrated _ nature of these bounds arises from the fact that they were obtained by assuming the fulfillment of the energy condition in the whole interval of integration @xmath56 .",
    "however , in the same way that a positive sum of @xmath57 terms does not necessarily imply that all the terms of the sum are also positive , the fulfillment of the _ integrated _ bounds on @xmath22 and @xmath0 does not necessarily imply that the energy conditions are obeyed in all subintervals of @xmath41 but only in at least an undetermined subinterval .",
    "reciprocally , the violation of these _ integrated _ bounds merely implies that the corresponding energy condition was violated in at least a subinterval of @xmath41 .",
    "this amounts to saying that the fulfillment ( or the violation ) of any of these bounds at a given redshift @xmath17 is not a sufficient ( nor a necessary ) _ local _ condition for the fulfillment ( or respectively the violation ) of the associated energy condition at @xmath17 . in practice",
    ", this means that the local confrontation between the prediction of the _ integrated _ bounds such as those on @xmath22 and on @xmath0 [ eqs .   ] and",
    "[    eqs .   ] and observational data is not suitable to draw conclusions on the local fulfillment or violation of the associated energy conditions at @xmath17 .",
    "is sufficient to ensure only the fulfillment ( or respectively the violation ) of the associated energy conditions somewhere in at least a subinterval of the integration interval @xmath56 , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite and concretely illustrate in section  [ sec : results ] . ]",
    "the practical limitation in the local confrontation between the above _ integrated _ bounds and observational data calls for _ non - integrated _ bounds from energy conditions , which can be easily obtained by rewriting eqs .   in terms of the deceleration parameter , @xmath58 , and the normalized hubble function , @xmath59 , in the following form : @xmath60 for any spatial curvature @xmath61 .",
    "some words of clarification are in order here concerning the above bounds .",
    "first , we note that for a fixed value of @xmath62 , eq .   provides the * wec * lower - bound on normalized hubble function @xmath52 for any @xmath17 , whereas eqs .   and give , respectively , the * nec * and * dec * bounds on parameters of @xmath63 plane for any fixed redshift @xmath64 ( say ) . also , the * sec * lower bound [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : sec - q(z ) ] ) ] clearly holds regardless of the value of the spatial curvature .",
    "second , since the bounds have been derived without making any integration ( _ non - integrated _ bounds ) , they are clearly sufficient and necessary to ensure the _ local _ fulfillment of the associated energy condition . in practice , this allows local confrontation between the predictions of these _ non - integrated _ bounds and , e.g. , sne ia data , an issue which we shall discuss in the following sections focusing in the flat ( @xmath65 ) flrw case , in which the * nec * and * dec * _ non - integrated _ bounds reduce , respectively , to @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and where obviously the fulfillment of the * sec * [ @xmath68 implies that the * nec * is satisfied identically .",
    "in order to make the confrontation between the _ non - integrated _ bounds [ eqs .   ] with observational data we need estimates of @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "model - independent estimates of these parameters can be obtained by approximating the deceleration parameter as a function of the redshift in terms of a linear piecewise continuous function , known as linear spline , @xmath71 where the subscript @xmath72 means that the quantity is taken at @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and the prime means the derivative with respect to @xmath17 .",
    "we use the definition of @xmath6 in terms of @xmath22 to obtain @xmath75 and , consequently , the luminosity distance and the distance modulus using eqs .   and .",
    "then we fitted the parameters of the @xmath6 curve using the type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) redshift  distance modulus data from _ gold _ sample @xcite and a _ combined _ sample @xcite .      in figs.[fig :",
    "modulus](a ) and  [ fig : modulus](b ) we confront , the * nec * along with * dec * , and the * sec * _ integrated _ bounds on @xmath0 [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq : munec ] ) , ( [ eq : mudec ] ) and  ( [ eq : musec ] ) ] with sne ia of the _ combined _ sample as compiled in ref .",
    "@xcite for , respectively , the redshift intervals @xmath76 and @xmath77 by taking consistently @xmath78 . as discussed in @xcite . in fig.[fig : modulus](a ) and  fig.[fig : modulus](b ) we have dealt with this arbitrariness by noting that the confrontation between the integrated bounds [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq : munec])([eq : mudec ] ) ] with sne ia data depends on @xmath79 and @xmath47 through the additive term @xmath80 .",
    "thus , to obtain a value of @xmath81 consistent with the sne data , we have fitted the low redshift ( @xmath82 ) sne ia distance modulus treating @xmath79 as an unknown and taking the values of magnitude @xmath47 as given by the _ combined _ sample .",
    "clearly , this procedure for comparison between bounds with sne ia data is independent of a particular value of @xmath79 in the sense that one can also begin by taking a specific value of @xmath79 , adjust the value of @xmath81 , and treating @xmath47 as unknown instead . ]",
    "clearly there are several sne data points indicating the violation with more than @xmath83 of the _ integrated _ * nec * and * sec * upper - bounds on @xmath14 , and two data points suggesting the violation of the _ integrated _ * dec * lower - bound on the distance modulus with @xmath84 .",
    "to concretely contrast the _ integrated _ and _ non - integrated _",
    "bounds by using supernovae observations , we consider , as a first example , the supernova 1992bh at @xmath85 of the _ combined _ sample , whose observed distance modulus is @xmath86 while the upper - bound * nec * predictions is @xmath87 , i.e. , it violates the integrated upper - bound from * nec * with @xmath88 [ see fig.[fig : modulus](a ) ] . however , this local violation of the * nec * _ integrated _ bounds is not sufficient to guarantee the breakdown of the * nec * at @xmath89 .",
    "this point is made apparent in fig .",

    "[ fig : modulus](b ) the supernova 03d1co ( which belongs to the _ combined _ and _ gold _ samples ) at @xmath94 , is such that its observed value of the distance modulus [ _ gold _ : @xmath95 , _ combined _ : @xmath96 violated the * sec * _ integrated _ upper - bound predictions [ _ gold _ : @xmath97 , _ combined _ : @xmath98 with @xmath99 ( _ gold _ ) and @xmath100 ( _ combined _ ) .",

    "<S> a statistical confrontation , with @xmath2 confidence levels , between our bounds and supernovae data from the _ gold _ and _ combined _ samples is made for the recent past . </S>",
    "<S> our analyses indicate , with @xmath3 confidence levels , the fulfillment of both the weak energy condition ( * wec * ) and dominant energy condition ( * dec * ) for @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , they suggest a possible recent violation of the null energy condition ( * nec * ) with @xmath3 , i.e. a very recent phase of super - acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> our analyses also show the possibility of violation of the strong energy condition ( * sec * ) with @xmath3 in the recent past ( @xmath4 ) , but interestingly the @xmath6-best - fit curve crosses the * sec*fulfillment divider at @xmath7 , which is a value very close to the beginning of the epoch of cosmic acceleration predicted by the standard concordance flat @xmath8cdm scenario . </S>"
