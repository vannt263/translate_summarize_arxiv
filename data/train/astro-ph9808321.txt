    "recent cosmological observations have increased various lines of evidence that the matter density of the universe , @xmath3 , falls short of the closure density required to halt its expansion ( ostriker & steinhardt 1995 ; yoshii & peterson 1995 ; krauss 1997 ; bahcall & fan 1998 ) .",
    "these include the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background , large - scale structure of galaxy distribution , number evolution of clusters of galaxies , and large amount of gas in clusters combined with the constraints on light - element nucleosynthesis .",
    "then , in order to reconcile with the flat geometry of a universe favored by inflationary models , a cosmological constant @xmath4 , or @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the hubble constant , has been invoked to achieve the critical energy density , @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , the existence of a non - vanishing cosmological constant points to a concordance of various observations and cosmological models with a combination of @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( ostriker & steinhardt 1995 ) . the case for a flat universe with a non - zero @xmath9 appears to be more likely than an open universe , even when the recent revisions of the mean age of globular clusters and the current estimate of @xmath6 are incorporated ( krauss 1997 ; pont et al .",
    "most recently , the distance determinations of type ia supernovae at cosmological distances ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1998 ; garnavich et al .",
    "1998 ) revealed further evidence for an accelerative expansion of a universe .    on the contrary ,",
    "tight limits on a cosmological constant have been put from the statistics of gravitational lensing , because the number of multiply imaged qsos found in lens surveys is sensitive to the value of @xmath9 ( turner 1990 ; carroll , press & turner 1992 ) .",
    "systematic surveys to search for lensed qsos , such as the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) snapshot lens survey ( maoz et al . 1993 ) , have identified only a few lenses among hundreds of qsos , and this small lensing probability has been the central argument against a non - vanishing cosmological constant ( maoz & rix 1993 , hereafter referred to as mr ) . in particular , kochanek ( 1996 ) put severe limits @xmath10 at 95 % confidence in flat cosmologies , using all of existing optical lens surveys available then , together with the data of radio lenses to reproduce their image - separation distributions . these constraints on @xmath9 challenge the proposed cosmic concordance required from other various observations .",
    "modeling the statistics of gravitational lensing however contains uncertainties associated with the dynamical structure and number density of galaxies that work as a lens . among various galaxy types ,",
    "elliptical ( e ) and lenticular ( s0 ) galaxies play an essential role in the models , because spiral and irregular galaxies are known to make negligible contributions to lensing statistics ( mr ; kochanek 1996 ) .",
    "thus , attempts have been made to tighten the lens properties from spectroscopic and photometric data of e / s0 galaxies ( fukugita & turner 1991 , hereafter ft ; breimer & sanders 1993 ; franx 1993 ; kochanek 1994 ) .",
    "the internal dynamics of such galaxies is deduced from the velocity dispersions and light profiles , whereas the luminosity function ( lf ) of e / s0 galaxies provides the number density of galaxies responsible for lensing background qsos .",
    "thus , the resultant constraints on @xmath9 inevitably depend on how well all of these lens properties are modeled .",
    "here we present new calculations of the lensing statistics in view of the recently updated knowledge of the e / s0-type lfs and their internal dynamics .",
    "we show that the models using the updated schechter parameters for e / s0-type lfs , which have been derived from the recent redshift surveys combined with morphological classification , significantly revise the theoretical predictions of both the lensing probabilities and image - separation distributions .",
    "we also point out that earlier models considerably overestimate the lensing effects of less compact dwarf - type galaxies , which dominate the faint part of the schechter - form lf .",
    "our calculations using realistic internal structure and dynamics of such galaxies in @xmath113 are found to diminish their contribution to lensing statistics .",
    "our revised calculations applying to the data of the hst snapshot lens survey were reported in chiba & yoshii ( 1997 ) , showing that a low - density , flat universe is not statistically inconsistent with observations .",
    "this article is devoted to the further properties of our models for the lensing statistics in more detail .",
    "in particular , in order to pursue the most plausible set of cosmological parameters ( @xmath12 ) , we use all of the optical lens surveys including the hst snapshot lens survey .",
    "the data of radio lenses are also taken into account to tighten the results of the statistics ( kochanek 1996 ) , by estimating the relative likelihood of their observed image - separation distributions . in @xmath112",
    "we present the models for gravitational lensing and set all of ingredients required in the lensing statistics .",
    "the effects of the e / s0-type lfs on the lensing probability are discussed in @xmath113 to demonstrate how the updated knowledge of the lfs modifies the results in a significant manner . then in @xmath114",
    ", we apply the current lens models to the existing lens data and derive the new limits on cosmological parameters .",
    "implications of our results are discussed and conclusions are drawn in @xmath115 .",
    "in the presence of a lens along the light - ray path from a source to an observer , the ray is deflected by an amount that depends on the gravitational field of a lens .",
    "we assume that the density profile of a lens is represented by that of an isothermal sphere having a finite core , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the one - dimensional velocity dispersion and @xmath15 is the core radius .",
    "the impact parameter of a deflected light in the lens plane , @xmath16 , is related to that of an undeflected light , @xmath17 , through the equation ( hinshaw & krauss 1987 ) , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the critical impact parameter for multiple imaging in the case of a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) as a lens .",
    "this is defined as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the angular - diameter distance between the observer and the lens , @xmath22 between the lens and the source , and @xmath23 between the observer and the source .",
    "we use the filled beam formulae to define these distances .",
    "equation ( 2 ) admits three solutions @xmath24 with @xmath25 if @xmath17 is less than a critical impact parameter @xmath26 [ eq.(a2)-(a4 ) ] , under the condition that the ratio between @xmath15 and @xmath19 , @xmath27 , is smaller than 1/2 .",
    "the image 1 lies on the same side from the lens as the source , whereas the other two images ( images 2 and 3 ) lie on the opposite side of the lens from the source , where the innermost image 3 is faintest among three images .",
    "if either @xmath28 or @xmath29 is fulfilled , there is only one image .",
    "we summarize the characteristic properties of these lensed images in the appendix ( see also hinshaw & krauss 1987 ) . each image",
    "is then magnified by a factor @xmath30 compared to an unlensed image , and the total magnification factor @xmath31 is defined as @xmath32 .",
    "as demonstrated in the appendix , the presence of a core leads to larger @xmath31 than the sis case , while the cross section for lensing is reduced , @xmath33 .",
    "the image separation angle @xmath34 for these multiple images is well characterized by that between outer two images ( images 1 and 2 ) for @xmath35 , namely , @xmath36 .",
    "statistics of gravitational lensing depend on the number density distribution of lens galaxies .",
    "this is deduced from the lf of galaxies @xmath37 with luminosity @xmath38 . to compare with the earlier standard models of lensing statistics , we adopt the assumption that the comoving number density of galaxies is independent of lens redshift @xmath39 .",
    "the results of the canada - france redshift survey by lilly et al .",
    "( 1995 ) support this assumption ( see also totani & yoshii 1998 ) .    then , the probability that a qso with redshift @xmath40 and luminosity @xmath41 is lensed is evaluated from the fraction of the qsos that are amplified to this luminosity by lensing , among the total number of qsos . using the lf of qsos defined as @xmath42 ,",
    "this is expressed as , @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the selection function which depends on the image separation and magnitude difference between the primary and secondary images , and on the seeing in a lens survey ( e.g. maoz & rix 1993 ) . to perform the integration over @xmath17 ,",
    "it is convenient to avoid the divergence of image magnification when a qso lies at @xmath45 and @xmath26 . for this purpose ,",
    "we integrate it over the position of image 2 , @xmath46 , instead of the source position @xmath17 , using the jacobian @xmath47 which relates these two positions ( blandford & narayan 1986 ) .",
    "this yields @xmath48 over the range of @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the critical positions of image 2 relevant to @xmath35 and @xmath26 , respectively .    in order to relate luminosities of galaxies @xmath38 to their structural parameters ( @xmath52 )",
    ", we first assume the scaling relation between @xmath38 and @xmath14 , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the one - dimensional velocity dispersion at @xmath55 .",
    "this is in analogy to the faber - jackson relation for e and s0 galaxies , and we adopt @xmath56 for these galaxies that effectively work as a lens . as discussed in kochanek ( 1996 ) and chiba & yoshii ( 1997 ) , we will not introduce the correction to @xmath54 for the dark - matter velocity dispersion by a factor of @xmath57 , because detailed dynamical modeling of early - type galaxies by breimer & sanders ( 1993 ) , franx ( 1993 ) , and kochanek ( 1994 ) has invalidated this correction . if this correction is employed , the models will overestimate the lensing probability by a factor of @xmath58 .",
    "second , in contrast to the simple treatment of @xmath59 in chiba & yoshii ( 1997 ) , we take into account the observed increase of core radii with increasing luminosities of e / s0 galaxies , by the relation @xmath60 , where @xmath61 ( ft ; kochanek 1996 ; faber et al .",
    "1997 ) . from these scaling relations ,",
    "the parameter @xmath27 is expressed as @xmath62 , thereby increasing with increasing @xmath38 .    in conventional lens models ,",
    "the lf of lens galaxies @xmath63 is assumed to hold the schechter form , @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 are the normalization , the index of faint - end slope , and the characteristic luminosity , respectively . in this case , the lensing probability @xmath68 is proportional to a non - dimensional factor @xmath69 , defined as @xmath70 ( turner , ostriker & gott 1984 ; ft ) .      equation ( 3 ) indicates that the lensing probability depends on the shape of the qso lf , @xmath71 . as a standard case , we use the @xmath72-band lf adopted by wallington & narayan ( 1993 ) ( hereafter wn ) on the basis of the lf determination for @xmath73 ( boyle et al . 1988 ) and that for @xmath74 ( schmidt et al .",
    "1992 ; warren et al . 1992",
    "; irwin et al . 1992 ) .",
    "written as a function of absolute magnitude , @xmath75 , the qso lf @xmath76 is given in the smoothed two power - law form @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the magnitude of the break in the lf .",
    "for @xmath79 , this is given as @xmath80 with @xmath81 and @xmath82 mag for @xmath83 ( @xmath84 km s@xmath85 mpc@xmath85 ) , @xmath86 , and @xmath2 .",
    "for @xmath74 , the evolution of the break magnitude @xmath78 is corrected by @xmath87 to accord with the high - redshift qso surveys ( wallington & narayan 1993 ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath88 and @xmath89 denote the faint and bright end slopes , respectively .",
    "the effect of the so - called magnification bias such that lensed qsos are over - represented in magnitude - limited sample due to image amplification is taken into account through the ratio @xmath90 in the integrand of eq.(3 ) .",
    "in contrast to the sis case , we note that in the presence of a finite core , the integration over @xmath17 ( or over @xmath46 ) that includes this ratio can not be taken outside of other integrations over @xmath39 and @xmath38 due to the dependence of @xmath31 on @xmath91 ( see also hamana et al .",
    "1997 for more detail ) . to demonstrate the amount of the biasing effect , designated as @xmath92",
    ", we use the following definition @xmath93 in the sis case , this is reduced to @xmath94 .",
    "we calculate the bias @xmath95 as a function of @xmath75 in the @xmath72 band , using a set of fiducial lens parameters @xmath56 , @xmath61 , and @xmath96 km s@xmath85 .",
    "figure 1(a ) compares the sis case ( solid lines ) with the case having a finite core @xmath97 kpc for @xmath98 ( dotted lines ) and @xmath99 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "it is evident that the bias is made large in the presence of a core , so that the effect of smaller cross section for multiple imaging than in the sis case is reduced ( kochanek 1996 ; hamana et al .",
    "this is attributed to the larger image amplification @xmath31 in the presence of a core .",
    "it is also noted that the shallower faint - end slopes @xmath66 in the lfs of galaxies yield the larger bias , which thereby reduces the effect of less numbers of galaxies in such lfs on the lensing probability .",
    "this arises from the fact that the lfs having the shallower @xmath66 weight toward larger @xmath38 galaxies , thus larger @xmath100 , while the magnification bias increases with increasing @xmath100 ( hamana et al .",
    "1997 ) . figure 1(b ) shows the effects of changing qso lfs on the bias . in comparison with wn",
    "s qso lf , we also consider the broken power - law qso lfs adopted by mr ( @xmath101 mag ) , and ft ( @xmath102 mag ) .",
    "when compared to wn s lf , ft s lf yields the significant reduction of the bias at the bright end due to its much shallower slope @xmath103 , whereas mr s lf yields roughly the same bias although it is slightly smaller at high redshifts @xmath40 .",
    "this suggests that the lensing probability based on either ft s or mr s lf will be smaller than that based on wn s lf , as was also noted in kochanek ( 1996 ) .",
    "many of earlier lensing statistics use the schechter - form lf of all - type galaxies in efstathiou et al .",
    "( 1988 ) scaled by the postman & geller ( 1984 ) fraction ( 31% ) of e / s0 galaxies , because these early - type galaxies are essential in lensing statistics ( ft ; mr ) .",
    "the corresponding e / s0-type lf is hereafter referred to as eep s lf and its schechter parameters ( @xmath104 ) are tabulated in table 1 , where @xmath105 is the characteristic magnitude derived from @xmath67 .",
    "although this procedure of counting the number density of e / s0 galaxies has widely been adopted for lensing statistics , the different sampling and calibration between these observational studies prevent us from knowing the detailed shape of the e / s0-type lf in the sample of efstathiou et al .",
    "specifically , the faint - end slope @xmath66 and characteristic magnitude @xmath105 for only e / s0 galaxies are not necessarily the same as those for all - type galaxies .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that the lensing statistics based on eep s lf holds some unavoidable systematics .    comparing with the above indirect method ,",
    "the type - dependent lf for only e / s0 galaxies has been obtained on the basis of the recent redshift surveys of field galaxies combined with morphological classification .",
    "we consider the two lfs derived from the stromlo - apm survey ( loveday et al .",
    "1992 , lpem ) and the cfa survey ( marzke et al .",
    "1994 , mghc ) , in addition to eep s lf .",
    "the schechter parameters for only e / s0 galaxies are taken from these papers and tabulated in table 1 . comparing with eep s lf , lpem s lf",
    "is characterized by the shallow slope @xmath66 at the faint end and the small normalization @xmath65 , whereas for mghc s lf , @xmath105 is about 1 mag fainter and @xmath65 is about twice larger than the respective values of eep s lf .",
    "these revised values of the schechter parameters will yield the different values of @xmath54 and @xmath69 from those based on eep .",
    "we note that the high normalization @xmath65 of mghc s lf may be explained in terms of local density inhomogeneities present in the cfa survey volume , while the stromlo - apm survey samples a volume @xmath106 times larger than that of the cfa survey and so provides the reliable space density of galaxies .",
    "however , the reason for the faint value of @xmath105 in mghc s lf is not well understood .",
    "there are some discussion that this is due to the fainter zwicky magnitudes used in the cfa survey than the @xmath107 magnitudes in the stromlo - apm survey , by an amount of @xmath108 mag ( see e.g. huchra 1976 ; auman et al .",
    "1986 ; bothun & cornell 1990 , about detailed discussions of the zwicky magnitudes ) . if we transform @xmath105 in mghc by adding a constant offset , then the resultant value of @xmath105 is shifted toward the values in eep and lpem . to see how this offset changes the lensing probability",
    ", we also consider the case of @xmath109 mag in mghc , hereafter referred to as mghc2 ( table 1 ) .",
    "we note that there are also some suggestions that the zwicky magnitudes depend on surface brightness of galaxies , in a manner that the luminosities of compact galaxies such as e s tend to be overestimated ( auman et al .",
    "1986 ; de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "if this is the case , @xmath105 for e galaxies measured from the zwicky magnitudes may be brighter than from other magnitude systems .",
    "as discussed in eep , the transforms between the magnitude systems also contain color terms , complex isophotal corrections , etc .",
    ", so that the procedure of transforming @xmath105 from one system into another by adding a constant offset is a gross oversimplification .",
    "thus , in view of these uncertainties , the results based on mghc2 need caution .    most recently , the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs ) provided the expanded galaxy sample in the largest survey volume ( lin et al .",
    "the lf of all galaxy sample ( after transformation from the kron - cousins @xmath110 band system used in lcrs to the @xmath107 band ) is in good agreement with that from the stromlo - apm survey . although the type - dependent lfs are not yet available , the lfs based on the [ o ii ] @xmath1113727 emission feature ( lin et al . 1996 ) or on the more detailed spectral classification scheme ( bromley et al .",
    "1997 ) show that the faint - end slopes @xmath66 become progressively shallower from late to early - type galaxies .",
    "this dependence of @xmath66 on galaxy type is in good agreement with lpem s result .",
    "thus , an argument that the shallow @xmath66 in lpem s e is due to failure of identifying faint ellipticals ( mghc ) may not be supported . here for comparison , we also take into account lcrs s lf based on the galaxies that show no [ o ii ] @xmath1113727 emission ( table 1 ) .",
    "we shift lcrs s @xmath105 by 1.1 mag to match the mean rest - frame color @xmath112 of lcrs galaxies ( lin et al .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the derived @xmath105 is slightly fainter than those in other lfs .",
    "however , the results also need great caution because of ambiguous morphological classification .    in order to derive the characteristic velocity dispersion @xmath54 from the observed @xmath105",
    ", we use the faber - jackson relation determined by de  vaucouleurs & olson ( 1982 ) for early - type galaxies , @xmath113 then , for the fractional values ( @xmath114 ) of ( e , s0 ) galaxies in the number density , respectively , we evaluate @xmath54 for e / s0 galaxies by means of @xmath115 .",
    "this is because the lensing probability is proportional to the fourth power of @xmath54 in the definition of @xmath69 ( eq.5 ) .",
    "we adopt the postman & geller ( 1984 ) fraction ( e:12% , s0:19% ) to calculate @xmath54 for the lfs of eep , lpem , and lcrs , while for the lfs of mghc and mghc2 we use marzke et al .",
    "( 1994 ) s table 1 .",
    "the values of @xmath54 and @xmath69 derived from these new lfs appear to be systematically smaller than those from eep s lf ( see table 1 ) due to the above mentioned difference in the schechter parameters .",
    "therefore , the total lensing probability based on the updated schechter parameters for e / s0 galaxies will be reduced .    to highlight these effects of updating the schechter parameters ,",
    "we calculate the lensing probability of a qso with @xmath116 mag and @xmath117 , for the standard lens parameters of @xmath56 , @xmath97 kpc , and @xmath61 .",
    "figure 2 shows the image - separation distributions @xmath118 for the cases of eep ( solid line ) , lpem ( dotted line ) , mghc ( short - dashed line ) , mghc2 ( long - dashed line ) , and lcrs ( thick solid line ) .",
    "the image - separation distribution for the case of eep differs significantly from those for lpem and mghc .",
    "lpem s lf having shallower faint - end slope @xmath66 and smaller normalization @xmath119 shifts the distribution to somewhat large image separations with smaller overall amplitude .",
    "mghc s lf having fainter",
    "@xmath105 considerably suppresses the distribution at larger separation and makes it peaked at smaller separation . in either case ,",
    "the total lensing probability is decreased when compared to the result from eep s lf .",
    "this clearly indicates that the predicted lensing probability is sensitive to the adopted schechter parameters for the lfs of e / s0 galaxies .",
    "the figure also suggests that the case of mghc2 produces a similar @xmath118 to that of eep , whereas the case of lcrs leads to the skewed @xmath118 towards larger image separations with smaller overall amplitude .",
    "considering great ambiguities in the e / s0-type lfs inferred from mghc2 and lcrs as discussed above , we will not consider these cases in what follows .",
    "updated lfs of lpem and mghc hold separate combinations of schechter parameters and yield different lensing probabilities",
    ". however , kochanek ( 1996 ) contrived the lf in a mixed manner by adopting @xmath105 from the all - type lf by eep , @xmath66 from the all - type lf by lpem and mghc , and @xmath65 from the all - type lf by lpem after scaled with mghc s fraction of e / s0 galaxies . in his lens model , the characteristic velocity dispersion @xmath54 for e / s0 was taken from the work of kochanek ( 1994 ) that showed @xmath120 km s@xmath85 using eep s @xmath105 . to compare with other cases",
    ", we also consider the lf adopted by kochanek ( 1996 ) , hereafter referred to as k96 s lf , in the statistics discussed in @xmath114 , and the associated schechter and lens parameters are given in the last line of table 1 .",
    "we remark that in each galaxy survey , the schechter parameters have been determined in a highly correlated manner , so that kochanek s method of combining the results from various surveys lacks consistency and thus causes artificial systematics .",
    "in particular , while the number density @xmath65 of e / s0 galaxies was averaged between lpem and mghc , adoption of the bright @xmath121 mag and steep @xmath98 , irrespective of the reported fainter @xmath105 in lpem and the shallower @xmath66 in mghc for e / s0 galaxies than each other , leads to a bias in favor of large lensing probabilities .",
    "the best way of avoiding these artificial systematics is to use the schechter parameters as reported in the original references .",
    "earlier models for lensing statistics adopted the schechter form for the e / s0-type lf .",
    "specifically , the index of faint - end slope @xmath66 is usually @xmath122 as in eep , thereby implying the existence of numerous faint e / s0 galaxies that work as a lens .",
    "however , the faint part of the e / s0-type lf is still uncertain because the limited resolution hinders reliable type classification for faint galaxies .",
    "moreover , distance determinations for _ field _ galaxies from their observed redshifts may be uncertain to some extent because of the peculiar galactic motions in the local field . on the other hand , the problem of accurate distance determinations is avoided by using nearby clusters of galaxies which offer a homogeneous sample of member galaxies at the same distance , observed down to faint magnitudes .",
    "sandage , binggeli & tammann ( 1985 ) and ferguson & sandage ( 1991 ) have indicated that while the faint part of the lfs for all galaxies is dominated by diffuse and less luminous dwarf - type galaxies , the lfs for e / s0 galaxies alone also show a sharp decline towards faint magnitudes , similarly towards bright magnitudes .",
    "this bounded form of lfs at both bright and faint ends was first recognized by hubble ( 1936 ) . for field",
    "e / s0 galaxies , there is also an indication of such a decline towards faint magnitudes ( binggeli , sandage & tammann 1988 ; driver et al .",
    "1994 ; driver et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "it has also become clear that early - type dwarf galaxies below @xmath123 mag which populate at the faint end of the lf show the different internal structure and dynamics from those of bright ellipticals ( e.g. ferguson & binggeli 1994 ) .",
    "the radial brightness profile of such dwarf galaxies is well represented by the exponential form @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the scale length .",
    "this is reminiscent of the profile of spiral disks and is in contrast with the more centrally concentrated @xmath126 law in bright ellipticals .",
    "this brightness profile suggests a large core radius @xmath127 kpc ( e.g. kormendy 1988 ; ferguson & binggeli 1994 ) , so that the parameter @xmath27 introduced in the current lens model may be larger than 1/2 in all lens redshifts .",
    "also , the luminosity - velocity relation follows @xmath128 ( held et al .",
    "1992 ) that deviates from the @xmath129 law of the bright e / s0 galaxies .",
    "thus , the faint galaxies have smaller internal velocity dispersions than that expected from the @xmath129 law . these diffuse properties of faint early - type galaxies are well predicted from the models of formation of dwarf galaxies invoking galactic winds and subsequent adiabatic expansion ( dekel & silk 1986 ; yoshii & arimoto 1987 ) .",
    "consequently , because these faint early - type galaxies have large @xmath15 and small @xmath14 , their contribution to the lensing statistics is negligible .    to demonstrate these properties of dwarf galaxies in lensing calculations",
    ", we construct the model lfs of early - type galaxies which consist of both e / s0 and de / ds0 types .",
    "the parameters for the lfs used are tabulated in table 2 and the shape of the lfs is graphically displayed in fig.3 . the schechter parameters for e / s0-type galaxies roughly accord with those derived from existing galaxy surveys , except that the lf at the faint magnitude is reduced by multiplying a factor @xmath130 with @xmath131 mag in order to match the observed shape of e / s0-type lfs ( driver et al .",
    "the schechter parameters for de / ds0-type galaxies are taken from the work of phillips and driver ( 1995 ) , by assuming @xmath132 mag , @xmath133 , and a very steep slope @xmath134 . as is evident from fig .",
    "3 , the total lf ( thin solid line ) derived from the e / s0-type ( dashed line ) and de / ds0-type lfs ( dotted line ) resembles a single schechter form .",
    "the parameters by which this total lf is fitted to a single schechter function ( thick solid line ) are also given in table 2 .",
    "using these lfs , we calculate the lensing probability of a qso with @xmath116 mag and @xmath117 . for e / s0 galaxies ,",
    "the lens parameters are taken as @xmath56 , @xmath97 kpc , and @xmath61 , whereas for de / ds0 galaxies , we assume @xmath135 , @xmath136 kpc @xmath137 ( @xmath138 ) . in order to evaluate @xmath54 from @xmath105 for e / s0 galaxies , we use eq.(9 ) and the postman & geller ( 1984 ) fraction for these galaxy types . for de / ds0 galaxies ,",
    "we use the data of ic794 ( bender & nieto 1990 ; held et al . 1992 ) to obtain the following approximate relation that obeys the scaling @xmath139 , @xmath140    figure 4(a ) shows the lensing probability at @xmath141 as a function of galaxy magnitudes @xmath142 in the @xmath72 band .",
    "it follows that de / ds0 galaxies contribute very little to the lensing probability ; if we adopt a more realistic core radius of @xmath127 kpc ( e.g. kormendy 1988 ; ferguson & binggeli 1994 ) , the lensing probability is much more reduced than presented with @xmath143 kpc .",
    "figure 4(b ) shows the image separation distribution .",
    "it is evident from these figures that use of a simple schechter form for e / s0-type lf , as has been adopted in previous lensing models , considerably overestimates the lensing probability at the faint magnitudes and therefore at the small image separations .    in order to consider this trivial effect of dwarf - type galaxies on lensing probabilities at the faint part of the lfs of eep , lpem , and mghc , we introduce a magnitude cutoff of @xmath130 in these lfs and examine the effect of changing @xmath144 over its possible range . figure 5(a )",
    "shows the image - separation distributions @xmath118 for @xmath145 ( no cutoff ) , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 mag , and fig .",
    "5(b ) shows the ratios of the total lensing probability @xmath68 with cutoff relative to that without cutoff as a function of @xmath144 .",
    "it is clear that the suppression of faint , less - massive galaxies from the originally schechter - form lf reduces the incidents of small - separation lensing .",
    "we also find that the result from lpem is very insensitive to @xmath144 , because the shallow faint - end slope @xmath66 of lpem s lf implies the small number of faint e / s0 galaxies irrespective of introducing the magnitude cutoff .",
    "we apply the current lens model to the sample of 867 unduplicated qsos at @xmath148 ( as in kochanek 1996 ) , which are taken from the optical lens surveys such as the cfht survey ( crampton et al . 1992 ; yee et al . 1993 ) , the eso key - programme survey ( surdej et al . 1993 ) , the hst snapshot survey ( maoz et al . 1993 ) , the not survey ( jaunsen et al .",
    "1995 ) , and the fks survey ( kochanek et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the @xmath72-band absolute magnitudes of these qsos are evaluated from the @xmath149-band apparent magnitudes tabulated in each survey , a power - law qso spectrum of @xmath150 for the @xmath151-corrections , and a typical @xmath152 mag in the qso rest frame as adopted by previous workers .",
    "we note that @xmath149 magnitudes of some numbers of qsos are based on the catalogue of vron - cetty and vron ( 1996 ) which provides not always accurate magnitudes . in this combined sample ,",
    "only six qsos are lensed ( 1208@xmath1531011 , 1413@xmath153117 , 1009@xmath1540252 , 1115@xmath153080 , 0142@xmath154100 , and 0957@xmath153561 ) .",
    "we do not use 0957@xmath153561 having a large image separation @xmath155 , because the lensed image of this qso is affected by an intervening cluster of galaxies .",
    "when we apply the lens model to these lens surveys , the selection functions @xmath44 ( see eq.3 ) inherent in the surveys for detecting multiple images give the additional constraints on the range of the impact parameter for lensing and thus affect the estimate of lensing probabilities .",
    "for each qso , we evaluate the selection function which depends on the seeing in the relevant survey and the magnitude difference between the primary and secondary images .",
    "when the qsos are observed in both the hst and other grand - based surveys , we adopt the hst results because of the high resolution of detecting separate images down to @xmath156 .",
    "in addition to the optical sample , we consider the radio lenses , as in kochanek ( 1996 ) . while the incomplete information on the redshift and @xmath72-band luminosities of the sample in the radio surveys prevents us from calculating the absolute lensing probability in this sample , it is possible to use the observed image separations of the radio lenses in order to obtain how likely these data are reproduced in the current lens models .",
    "we adopt the ten radio lenses listed in kochanek ( 1996 ) ( class 1608@xmath153656 , mg 1131@xmath153045 , mg 0414@xmath1530534 , mg 1654@xmath1531346 , b 1938@xmath153666 , mg 1549@xmath1533047 , class 1600@xmath153434 , b 1422@xmath153231 , mg 0751@xmath1532716 , and b 0218@xmath153357 ) . for the purpose of comparing his results with ours",
    ", we follow his procedure to assign redshifts and magnitudes for the lenses when these data are not available .",
    "we then calculate the sum of the lensing probabilities @xmath157 for the optical qsos to obtain the expected number of lensed qsos @xmath158 and the image - separation distribution @xmath159 .",
    "the former is restricted to the lenses with @xmath160 in order to avoid ambiguities associated with unusually large separations .",
    "we also calculate the likelihood function @xmath161 for the models to reproduce @xmath162 unlensed optical qsos , @xmath163 lensed optical qsos , and @xmath164 radio lenses having image separations @xmath118 ( see kochanek 1996 ) , @xmath165 where only the relative likelihood is computed for radio lenses to achieve the observed image separations .",
    "figure 6(a ) shows the predicted number of optical lenses @xmath166 against @xmath3 for the flat universe of @xmath1 .",
    "we take a standard parameter set of @xmath97 kpc , @xmath56 , @xmath61 , and wn s lf for qsos .",
    "different curves correspond to the results from the lfs of eep ( solid line ) , lpem ( dotted line ) , mghc ( dashed line ) , and k96 ( thick solid line ) . for eep , lpem , and mghc ,",
    "three cases of @xmath167 , @xmath168 , and @xmath169 mag are shown from the lower to upper curves , whereas the magnitude cutoff is not used for k96 . comparing the predicted number of lenses with the observed five lenses among the current qso sample ,",
    "it is obvious that different lfs predict the different best values of @xmath3 , as @xmath170 for mghc , @xmath171 for lpem , and @xmath172 for eep .",
    "this effect of adopting different lfs overwhelms the effect of changing @xmath144 significantly .",
    "it is remarkable that use of the updated lfs for e / s0 galaxies yields a small @xmath3 ( or large @xmath9 ) in contrast to the earlier strong conclusion in favor of @xmath86 ( mr ; k96 ) .    in order to elucidate the most likely case , we show in fig.6(b ) the image - separation distribution @xmath173 for each lf with the value of @xmath3 that reproduces the observed number of lenses .",
    "the histogram denotes the image - separation distribution of the five optical lenses identified in the current sample , and the distribution of the ten radio lenses is shown by marking an asterisk at each image separation .",
    "comparing the predicted and observed distribution @xmath173 including radio lenses , the model using lpem s lf appears to reproduce the data better than the models using other lfs .",
    "specifically , mghc s lf yields too many small separations and at the same time falls short of the observed number of both optical and radio lenses at @xmath174 .",
    "this large difference between the predicted and observed separation distributions holds also for the lfs of both eep and k96 .",
    "following these results , we determine the best combination of lf and cosmological parameters that maximizes the likelihood @xmath161 defined in eq .",
    "( 11 ) to simultaneously reproduce the number of lenses @xmath166 and the separation distribution @xmath173 .",
    "figure 7 shows the likelihood results when using the lfs of lpem ( dotted lines ) , eep ( solid lines ) , and k96 ( thick solid line ) , where three lines for lpem and eep correspond to the cases with @xmath167 , @xmath147 , and @xmath169 mag .",
    "all likelihood values are normalized by its maximum @xmath175 which is derived using lpem s lf with @xmath131 mag .",
    "note that the case for mghc s lf yields quite a small @xmath161 ( @xmath176 ) and is not shown in the figure .",
    "we have confirmed kochanek ( 1996 ) s result that an @xmath177 universe gives the highest likelihood ( @xmath178 ) as long as his lf is used .",
    "however , eep s lf with @xmath179 mag also provides the similar likelihood at a lower @xmath3 .",
    "it is evident from these cases that lpem s lf yields much larger likelihood over a broad range of @xmath3 .",
    "the peak of the likelihood is located at @xmath180 in flat cosmologies , and this appears to be very insensitive to the value of @xmath144 .",
    "if we take @xmath181 as the most likely case , a universe with @xmath86 is ruled out at 98 % confidence level .",
    "for an open universe with @xmath2 , the likelihood monotonically increases with decreasing @xmath3 and @xmath182 is as small as @xmath183 at @xmath184 with lpem s lf .",
    "the above analyses support that the observations are best explained by the lens model using the updated e / s0-type lf of lpem , among the lfs adopted in the current work .",
    "it should be kept in mind that mghc s lf contains some uncertainties related to the zwicky magnitude system used in the cfa survey .",
    "we then examine how the likelihood based on lpem s lf is changed when the inherent model parameters are varied , and the result is tabulated in table 3 .",
    "decreasing a core radius does not affect the likely range of @xmath3 significantly , because the effect of magnification bias is simultaneously decreased , as discussed in @xmath112.2 .",
    "artificial increase of @xmath54 irrespective of the value derived from the faber - jackson relation ( eq .",
    "9 ) tends to favor a larger @xmath3 , but the likelihood value turns out to decrease at the same time , as discussed below .",
    "intriguingly , the likelihood result for lpem s lf is essentially unchanged even if no cutoff is employed , because of the shallow faint - end slope @xmath66 .",
    "use of mr s qso lf slightly decreases the likely value of @xmath3 , but the change is modest .",
    "the lensing probability is proportional to @xmath185 , thereby the statistics based on the observed number of lensed qsos is sensitive to what value is assigned to @xmath54 .",
    "we have estimated @xmath54 from the faber - jackson relation ( eq .",
    "9 ) using the observed value of @xmath105 and the possible fraction of e and s0 types . however , while the large fraction of s0-type galaxies for a given fraction of both e and s0 types implies smaller @xmath54 , as suggested from eq.(9 ) , there are large uncertainties in distinguishing between e and s0 types .",
    "also , the self - consistent modeling of internal dynamics in e / s0 galaxies suggests that @xmath14 increases slowly with increasing @xmath15 ( kochanek 1996 ) .",
    "in view of these uncertainties in assigning the value of @xmath54 , we in turn compute the likelihood for various values of @xmath54 in flat cosmologies , using lpem s lf .",
    "figure 8 shows the likelihood in the two dimensional parameter space @xmath186 for flat cosmologies .",
    "contours are shown at 68 % ( 1 @xmath187 ) , 90 % , 95.4 % ( 2 @xmath187 ) , and 99 % confidence levels for one degree of freedom in the likelihood ratio .",
    "it follows that within the 1 @xmath187 confidence interval for @xmath54 , which includes @xmath188",
    "km s@xmath85 derived from the faber - jackson relation ( see table 1 ) , a low - density universe with @xmath189 is favored .",
    "if we further increase @xmath54 , the peak of the likelihood is located at a higher @xmath3 but the overall likelihood turns to decrease .",
    "this is because the models with such large values of @xmath54 yield larger average image separations than observed .",
    "therefore , even if uncertainties in the lens model are taken into account , a low - density , flat universe with a large @xmath9 is statistically consistent with the observations when we use the updated lf for e / s0 galaxies . in sharp contrast to the previous models of lensing statistics that have supported a high - density universe with @xmath86",
    ", we conclude that a universe with @xmath0 and @xmath1 casts the best case to explain the results of the observed lens surveys .",
    "we have presented new calculations of gravitational lensing statistics in view of the recently revised knowledge of the internal dynamics and number density of early - type galaxies .",
    "main revised points in the lens models are summarized as follows .",
    "( 1 ) the factor of @xmath57 correction for @xmath14 is not used following the detailed dynamical modeling of early - type galaxies ( breimer & sanders 1993 ; franx 1993 ; kochanek 1994 ) .",
    "( 2 ) the type - specific schechter parameters for e / s0 galaxies are adopted from the recent redshift surveys of galaxies combined with morphological classification . ( 3 ) the faint part of the lf of e / s0 galaxies , which is dominated by diffuse dwarf - type galaxies , is found to be unimportant for lensing statistics .",
    "all of these revisions point to smaller lensing probabilities than earlier predicted .",
    "applications of the lens models to the existing lens surveys suggest that both the total number of optical lenses _ and _ the image separations of optical and radio lenses are best reproduced in a low - density , flat universe . as the best set of cosmological parameters we arrive at @xmath0 with @xmath1 . a flat universe with @xmath86 is ruled out at 98 % confidence .",
    "we also find that @xmath190 at 94 % confidence in flat cosmologies , and that an open universe with @xmath2 is less likely than a flat universe with @xmath191 .",
    "our conclusion supporting a large @xmath9 is virtually in contrast to that of kochanek ( 1996 ) who strongly argued against it using the same qso sample as adopted here .",
    "main difference between his result and ours originates from the points ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) stated above .",
    "in particular , kochanek gathered the schechter parameters of e / s0 galaxies from various lf determinations by eep , mghc , and lpem .",
    "he has adopted @xmath121 mag from the all - type lf by eep , @xmath98 from the all - type lf by lpem and mghc , and @xmath192 from the scaling of lpem s @xmath193 for all types by mghc s e / s0 fraction . however , since the schechter parameters have been determined by means of a highly correlated fitting in each galaxy survey , a simple mixture of these parameters taken from various references lacks consistency .",
    "specifically , his use of brighter @xmath105 and steeper @xmath66 than those of e / s0 galaxies reported in the original references ( see table 1 ) leads to a bias in favor of a systematically large lensing probability .",
    "a further effect against a large @xmath9 seen in his model as well as other earlier models lies in the counting of large numbers of less compact dwarf - type galaxies as lens objects which dominate the faint part of the lf .",
    "models for gravitational lensing must explain not only the observed probability of lensing but also the relative probability of showing a specified image separation .",
    "the average image separation increases with increasing @xmath54 , thereby the lens data are expected to constrain @xmath54 irrespective of the value derived from @xmath105 found in each galaxy survey and the faber - jackson relation .",
    "however , our exercise of using the trivial effect of faint galaxies in lensing , which is also consistent with shallower faint - end slope @xmath66 for earlier types seen in lpem and lcrs ( lin et al .",
    "1996 ; bromley et al .",
    "1997 ) , implies a larger average image separation even when @xmath54 is fixed . as a result ,",
    "the estimate of @xmath54 which accords with the image - separation distributions depends on the faint part of the lf for e / s0 galaxies adopted . in this respect , it is notable that the lens model using lpem s @xmath194 which was not explored by kochanek ( 1996 ) provides much better fitting to the observed image separations for optical and radio lenses , even if his preferred value of @xmath195 km s@xmath85 is used in our analysis .    intriguingly , our 1 @xmath187-confidence limit @xmath196 with @xmath1 is in good accord with the recent result of i m , griffiths , & ratnatunga ( 1997 ) who analyzed the redshifts of known lensed qsos combined with the observed image separations and lens properties .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that their method is immune to the uncertainties associated with the determinations of the lf .",
    "this may suggest that lensing statistics using the realistic form for the lf , as adopted in the present work , yield the similar results .",
    "however , before concluding so definitely , we require a sample of more high-@xmath197 qsos in light of gravitational lensing , together with more definite knowledge of the internal dynamics and number density of lensing galaxies over a wide range of redshifts .",
    "significant increase and improvement of the information on lensing phenomena will then allow us to answer whether there is a concordance of a flat , @xmath9-dominated universe with observations .",
    "the authors are grateful to t.  futamase and b.  a.  peterson for useful discussions during the course of the present work . this work has been supported in part by the grand - in - aid for scientific research ( 09640328 ) and coe research ( 07ce2002 ) of the ministry of education , science , and culture in japan .",
    "from the lens equation ( 2 ) , the critical impact parameter @xmath26 for multiple imaging is written as @xmath198 \\ , \\ ] ] provided @xmath199 .",
    "after some algebra , the three solutions to eq.(2 ) are given by @xmath200 where @xmath201    figure 9(a ) shows the total amplification factor @xmath32 for two representative cases of @xmath202 and 0.25 , compared to the sis case .",
    "it follows that the presence of a finite core leads to diverging @xmath31 at the caustics @xmath45 and @xmath26 , and hence results in the value of @xmath31 which is larger than the sis case .",
    "figure 9(b ) shows the cross section @xmath203 for multiple imaging ( thick solid line ) , and the separation angles @xmath34 between two outer images ( image 1 and 2 ) for @xmath45 ( solid line ) , @xmath204 ( dotted line ) , and @xmath205 ( dashed line ) , respectively .",
    "it is clear that the presence of a finite core reduces the cross section for lensing , and that @xmath34 is almost independent of the impact parameter @xmath17 , thereby being well approximated as @xmath206 at @xmath45 .",

    "<S> we find that the lens models using updated schechter parameters for such galaxies , derived from the recent redshift surveys combined with morphological classification , are found to give smaller lensing probabilities than earlier calculated . </S>",
    "<S> inconsistent adoption of these parameters from a mixture of various galaxy surveys gives rise to systematic biases in the results . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that less compact dwarf - type galaxies which largely dominate the faint part of the schechter - form luminosity function contribute little to lensing probabilities , so that earlier lens models overestimate incidents of small separation lenses . applications of the lens models to the existing lens surveys indicate that reproduction of both the lensing probability of optical sources _ and _ the image separations of optical and radio lenses is significantly improved in the revised lens models . </S>",
    "<S> the likelihood analyses allow us to conclude that a flat universe with @xmath0 and @xmath1 is most preferable , and a matter - dominated flat universe with @xmath2 is ruled out at 98 % confidence level . </S>",
    "<S> these new limits are unaffected by inclusion of uncertainties in the lens properties . </S>"
