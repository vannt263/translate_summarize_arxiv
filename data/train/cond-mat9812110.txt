    "it follows that _ latt= & + & to define a continuum limit for this model , we look at distances large compared to the lattice spacing but small compared to @xmath58 , where the right hand side of the previous expression simplifies into _ latt(al)^(_1+_2)^2/4(|r - r|a ) ^_1_2/2 the well known observation follows that the correlator vanishes unless charge neutrality is satisfied , that is @xmath59 .",
    "we then have , where @xmath52 are now arbitrary points in the continuum , ( a|r - r| ) ^^2/2 in the following we will sometimes , but not always , set @xmath60 .",
    "we now introduce complex coordinates @xmath61 .",
    "we have @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and we define the delta function by @xmath64 , so @xmath65 .",
    "the action reads now s = d^2z , and the laplacian = 2 + 2of crucial importance is the result has to be regulated with a short distance cut - off which does introduce a @xmath66 dependence , as for instance in @xmath67 , @xmath68 the heavyside function . ] ( 1)=2 ^ 2(z,)[basicid ] from which it follows that , and not twice as much . ]    as determines @xmath69 and @xmath70 ; but in what follows , we will reserve the notation @xmath71 for analytic functions . ]",
    "= -14|z - z|^2 note that , in this expression , we have completely discarded the @xmath58 dependence that occurs in the lattice system .",
    "a reason for doing so is that @xmath48 is not a `` good '' field anyway , and that we will usually consider rather derivatives of @xmath48 , for which this ambiguity does not matter .",
    "the @xmath58 dependence is however crucial for exponentials of the field @xmath48 .",
    "when we discard it , we have to remember that , at the end of the day , only correlators which have vanishing charge are non zero .",
    "now , still using wick s theorem it follows that = -12 , where the dots stand for any other insertions in the path integrals , that involve no field either at @xmath66 or @xmath72 . a relation that holds in this sense",
    "is simply rewritten ( z,)(z, ) = - 12 ^ 2(z - z,-)[queqofmot ] .",
    "this is the first example of equations we will write quite often between `` operators '' in the theory - the word operator here occurs naturally when one splits open the path integral to obtain a hamiltonian description , see later .",
    "recall that the equations of motion for the field @xmath48 read , on the other hand ( z,)=0 it follows that the product @xmath73 obeys the equation of motion except at coincident points .    in the sequel",
    ", we shall constantly use the concept of _ normal ordering_. we define the normal ordering of the product of two bosonic fields by and @xmath58 factors , the normal ordering formula reads @xmath74 .",

    "thus , for instance ( z,)(0,0)=-14|z|^2+:^2(0,0):+z:(0,0 ) : + : |(0,0):+  [fifi ] this is the first example of an operator product expansion ( ope ) . like equation ( [ queqofmot ] ) ,",
    "its precise meaning is that it holds once inserted inside a correlation function .",
    "opes in conformal field theories are not asymptotic , but rather convergent expansions ; their radius of convergence is given by the distance to the nearest other operator in the correlation functions of interest .",
    "the right hand side of ( [ fifi ] ) involves products of fields at coincident points , which turn out to be well defined in this theory .",
    "notice that @xmath76 in ( [ fifi ] ) could be defined equally well by point splitting , as will be discussed later .    for a product of more than two bosonic operators",
    ", the definition of normal order can be extended iteratively : ( z,)(z_1,_1)  (z_n,_n):= ( z,):(z_1,_1)  (z_n,_n ) : + + 14(|z - z_1|^2:(z_2,_2) ",

    "* exercise * : show that the `` quantum pythagoras '' theorem holds : @xmath79    notice that in ( [ derexp ] ) , we could have treated @xmath80 as an analytic function : a perfectly legitimate thing to do when one computes correlators .",
    "hidden here is , in fact , the very convenient decomposition of the field @xmath48 itself into the sum of an analytic and antianalytic component ( one has to be very careful however when one writes @xmath81 ; first , because such a decomposition does not hold for the general fields summed over in the path integral , and second , because the field @xmath48 does not obey the equations of motion at coincident points ) .",
    "pushing that line of thought a bit further however , one has = -14(z - z ) + = -14(- ) this up to phases due to the branch cuts .",
    "we will also use in the following the dual field = -|    the exponentials are scalar operators , ie they are invariant under rotations .",
    "more general operators also have a spin , so their two point function reads = 1z^2h ^2|h [ hhbar ] the simplest example is provided by @xmath82 which has @xmath83 . in general , single valuedness of physical correlators requires @xmath84 to be an integer .",
    "the numbers @xmath85 and @xmath86 are called usually right and left conformal dimensions .",

    "the stress energy tensor is defined in the classical theory as follows .",
    "consider a coordinate transformation @xmath90 ( that is , changing the arguments of the fields in the action from @xmath90 ) .",
    "the variation of the action reads , to lowest order , is peculiar to the conformal field theory literature .",

    "it enjoys some very important properties : the symmetry @xmath91 as a result of rotational invariance , and the tracelessness @xmath92 as a result of scale invariance .",
    "in addition , the stress energy tensor is always conserved , ie the operator equation @xmath93 holds .",
    "this can be checked explicitely for the free boson using ( [ classt ] ) and the classical equations of motion , which we recall are satisfied by normal ordered products .",

    "+ using the equations of motion , @xmath96 is analytic ( again , in the special sense that , when inserted in correlation functions , the dependence is analytic away from the arguments of the other operators ) and will simply be denoted @xmath97 in what follows ; similarly , @xmath98 is antianalytic .",
    "it is easy to chek that these properties extend to other models : a remarkable consequence of locality ( so there is a stress energy tensor to begin with ) and masslessness is thus the existence of a conserved current , a field of dimensions @xmath99 .",
    "currents provide a powerful tool to classify the fields of the theory , as we will see shortly .    plugging back our results into ( [ actchange ] ) ,",
    "one checks that the variation of the action @xmath94 vanishes exactly for a conformal transformation @xmath100 .",
    "this is the celebrated conformal invariance , which we will discuss in more details below .",
    "the short distance expansion of @xmath1 with itself reads t(z)t(0)=12z^4 + 2z^2t(0)+1zt(0)+ the coefficient of the @xmath101 term is uniquely determined once the normalization of @xmath1 has been chosen . for other massless relativistic field theories ,",
    "this coefficient takes the value @xmath102 where @xmath103 is a number known as the _ central charge_. for a free boson",
    "we see that @xmath104 . for @xmath105 independent free bosons , @xmath106 . for a free majorana fermion @xmath107 .",
    "the relative normalization of the two other factors is fixed by the requirement that @xmath108 .",
    "* exercise * : show this .",
    "the fact that @xmath1 is analytic except when its argument coincides with the one of some other field inside a correlator has an interesting consequence for the trace of the stress energy tensor .",
    "indeed , @xmath109 is now a derivative of the delta function ! using the conservation equation @xmath110 , which reads in complex components , @xmath111 ,",
    "if follows that the two point function of the trace of the stress energy tensor is non zero : ( x_1,x_2)[t_11+t_22](0,0)=c3 ^2(x_1,x_2 ) [ anoma ] this is a simple example of an anomaly , a quantity which is zero classically , but non zero quantum mechanically .",
    "it is a bit dangerous to give too much meaning to ( [ anoma ] ) however , since the trace is not really an independent object - it is much safer to remember again that classical equations of motion hold except at coincident points .",
    "remarkably , the stress energy tensor was introduced in a statistical mechanics long ago by kadanoff and ceva @xcite .",
    "these authors were interested in the way ising correlators change under shear and scaling transformations .",
    "they recognized that , in a critical theory , rescaling in the @xmath69 and @xmath70 directions was equivalent to changing the horizontal and vertical couplings , and thus that the effect of shear and scaling could be taken into account by introducing an operator `` conjugated '' to these changes in the correlators , just like , say a change in temperature could be taken into account by introducing the total energy in the correlators .",
    "it is thus possible to physically identify @xmath1 , and to wonder how its continuum limit behaves , and how the various algebraic properties we are going to derive emerge .      to fix ideas ,",
    "let us now consider the free bosonic theory on a cylinder of circumference @xmath112 and length @xmath58 . introducing the complex coordinate @xmath113 such that the imaginary axis is parallel to the cylinder s length ( see figure 4 ) ,",
    "the two point function of the field @xmath48 in that geometry is easily found to be _",
    "cylinder=-14|1 t t(w - w)|^2 .    from this",
    ", it follows that _ cylinder = ( t|t(w - w)|)^^2/ 2 let us focus on the holomorphic part _",
    "cylinder = ( tt(w - w))^^2/ 4 this can be shown to be , equivalently , _",
    "cylinder = ( dzdw)^h(dzw)^h _ plane , [ twopointconf ] where we used the mapping @xmath114 .",
    "the latter formula expresses the _ covariance _ of the two point function under the conformal transformation .",
    "another example of such covariance is provided by the derivative of the field = ( dzdw)(dzdw ) , [ twopointconfi ] where we suppressed mention of the geometry , which is implicit in the variables used .",
    "relations like ( [ twopointconf],[twopointconfi ] ) are well expected , since the gaussian action is , in fact , conformal invariant ; this follows , as discussed above , from the properties of the stress energy tensor , and thus is expected to generalize to other local massless field theories .",
    "more directly , this invariance is easily established for the free boson , since upon changing the argument of the field from @xmath115 in the action , @xmath116 is invariant , the jacobian cancelling the term coming from the partial derivatives .",
    "of course , one has to be quite careful in using the conformal invariance of the action , since the correlators are not invariant - ie , one has for instance , @xmath117 , while the naive change of variables in the action would suggest the propagators to map straightforwardly , and thus the equality to hold .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy comes from the cut - off , which is also modified in a conformal transformation .",
    "we , on the other hand , wish to use the same regularization whatever the geometry , ie , for instance , use a square lattice of constant @xmath50 to regularize both the problem in the plane and on the cylinder ; hence , there is an `` anomaly '' .",
    "fields obeying the general covariance relation ( and a similar one for the antiholomorphic part ) = ( dzdw)^h(dzdw)^h are called _",
    "primary fields_. the field @xmath118 itself is not primary , though , in a way , it satisfies the equivalent of the previous relation with @xmath119 , since = + 18 ( dzdw dzdw ) fields which are not primary exhibit in general more complicated covariance relations .",
    "an example is provided by the second derivative of @xmath118 , which we leave to the reader to work out .",
    "a more interesting example is furnished by the stress energy tensor .",
    "though we have defined it so far by normal ordering , it is clear that an equally good definition is obtained by point splitting , ie at the end ] t(z)=-2_d0[tdef ] we have thus , from the change of variables @xmath120\\ ] ] to define the stress energy tensor on the cylinder , we use the same definition ( [ tdef ] ) , but with @xmath66 replaced by @xmath121 . therefore t(z)=^2t(w)+112\\{w , z}[strestransf ] , where the added term is @xmath122 ^ 2}-{1\\over 2d^2}\\ ] ] this",
    "is known under the name of schwartzian derivative , and reads \\{w , z}=2ww-3w^42w^2 it enjoys nice properties under the composition of successive conformal transformations , that we leave to the reader to investigate .",
    "an important property following from ( [ strestransf ] ) is that @xmath1 acquires a finite expectation value on the cylinder , while it did not have one in the plane _",
    "c24(2t)^2[tcylin ] * exercise * : show this by using the propagators on the plane and the cylinder , together with appropriate definitions of normal ordering .",
    "the ope of the stress energy tensor with any field of the theory has the general form t(z)o(0,0)=  +hz^2o(0,0)+1zo(0,0)+  [primexp ] the two terms explicitely written follow from the fact that @xmath87 has dimension @xmath85 and the use of the ward identity ( [ ward ] ) .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath123 is the highest singularity if @xmath87 is primary .",
    "* exercise * : check this for the free boson by considering various examples .",
    "suppose in general that there is a transformation of the field @xmath124 that leaves the product of the path integral measure and the boltzmann weight @xmath125 invariant .",
    "examples of such transformations are provided for instance by translations or rotations in ordinary isotropic homogeneous physical systems .",
    "consider then a transformation @xmath126 .",
    "for general @xmath127 , this is not a symmetry of the problem anymore . on the other hand",
    ", we can always change variables in the functional integral and reevaluate any correlator in terms of the new field @xmath128 .",
    "this means that we have the identity 0=e^-s-e^-s[changofv ] where in @xmath129 one maybe had to add up terms coming from the change of variables in the path integral . on the other hand",
    ", one can expand the right hand side of this equation to first order in the change of fields assumed small .",
    "since for @xmath127 a constant the product of the measure and the weight would be invariant , this means that the right hand side of ( [ changofv ] ) must depend on the gradient of @xmath127 only , ie one has e^-sj _ _",
    "dx_1dx_2 [ noeth ] the quantity @xmath130 is called a noether current .",
    "since it comes from local manipulations , it must be a local quantity .",
    "now , that ( [ noeth ] ) vanishes is something that must hold for any reasonably smooth function @xmath127 .",
    "let us choose @xmath127 to be equal to unity inside a disk of radius @xmath131 , and to vanish on and outside of @xmath132 , while it is arbitrary in between . integrating ( [ noeth ] ) by parts",
    ", we get an integral of @xmath130 on the circle @xmath131 , together with an integral on the annulus between @xmath131 and @xmath132 of @xmath133 .",
    "since the functions @xmath127 is quite arbitrary there , it follows that the current has to be conserved , that is _",
    "j_=0[conserv ] this result would still hold of course with fields inserted far from @xmath131 and @xmath132 , so ( [ conserv ] ) truly holds as an operator equation , in the sense explained above .    as an application ,",
    "consider a translation @xmath90 , where @xmath134 is small and constant : we obtain a current which , in the classical case , coincides with @xmath135 .",
    "the foregoing procedure is a generalization to the quantum theory , and the conservation equation follows from noether s theorem .",
    "now consider some field @xmath87 inside the circles , say right at the origin . under the transformation",
    "@xmath136 , this field becomes @xmath137 ( the change is expanded to first order as before , but of course @xmath138 might as well depend on the derivatives of @xmath127 in general ) .",
    "we now have , since all we are doing is changing variables in the path integral 0=o  e^-s  -o  e^-s  expand this to first order .",
    "this time , the integration by part gives -io=12(dx_2",

    "where @xmath140 is small .",
    "the noether current associated with it is given by @xmath141 and @xmath142 . for a transformation that is conformal inside a contour @xmath143 , and differentiably connected to a ( necessary non conformal ) transformation vanishing at large distances ,",
    "one finds from ( [ changeofop ] ) the key result o=12i_c(z)t(z)o(0)dz-12i _ | ( ) |t()o(0)d[ward ] : derive from this ( [ primexp ] ) and the fact that there are no singularities stronger than @xmath123 for a primary operator .",
    "notice finally that for the free boson , the expression of the stress energy tensor is almost the classical one , up to normal ordering , and it appears as if the integration measure essentially plays no role in the construction of the ward identities . that one can forget about the behaviour of the measure in conformal transformations",
    "is justified a posteriori , by the fact that the quantum currents are indeed conserved .",
    "the measure would play a more subtle role for theories defined on curved two - dimensional manifolds .      as noticed",
    "before , the main consequence of conformal invariance is the existence of a conserved current , the stress energy tensor @xmath1 . in general , one sets t(z)=_n=-^ that is , plugging this expansion into the ope provides a definition of what the field @xmath144 actually is : for instance @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , etc . in general , one does not expect fields with negative dimensions to appear , or at least not fields with arbitrarily large negative dimensions ( weird things can occur in non unitary theories adapted to disordered systems in particular though ) .",
    "this means that for every field , @xmath148 must vanish for @xmath105 positive large enough . of particular interest",

    ", we can contend ourselves with the intuitively reasonable notion that the @xmath150 are `` operators '' acting on the space of fields of the theory - here , exponentials multiplied by normal ordered polynomials in derivatives of the field @xmath48 - so the @xmath150 are not unlike differential operators acting on functions ( in fact , the @xmath151 are just that ) .",
    "it is then tempting to ask oneself what the algebra of these operators is , that is how do @xmath152 compare with @xmath153 ?",
    "this is easily done by using contour integration together with the short distance expansions .",

    "indeed , imagine writing the ope of the integrand .",
    "first we expand @xmath156 to extract the field @xmath157 , on which the action of @xmath150 is then obtained by the second integration .",
    "that the countour @xmath143 is inside @xmath155 is natural from the point of view of `` radial quantization '' which , as we will see later , gives a precise operatorial definition to the @xmath150 s .",

    "the product @xmath158 is computed in the same fashion with this time with a contour @xmath159 inside @xmath143 : this forces one to expand first the product @xmath160 , resulting in the opposite order for the operators .",

    "arbitrary combinations of neighbour variables can be built , whose scaling limit may or may not give rise to new scaling fields : which are truly new , which are nothing but `` @xmath150 '' s ( descendents ) of others ?",
    "what happens is that a theory has a certain number of primary fields , which is very often finite ( eg , three for the ising model ) , and all the other fields are just descendents of these ones . the whole set of fields is thus organized into products of representations of the left and right virasoro algebras , for which the primary fields are heighest weight states .",

    ", we could define other operators and other algebras associated with any field that has an integer dimension ( so the contour integrals can be closed in the complex plane .",

    "the integrands have small distance behaviours @xmath300 .",
    "it follows that there is no short distance divergence , and the integrals are all finite for @xmath301 ( there are never large distance divergences here since we have a temperature ) .",

    "this can then be continued beyond @xmath304 simply by using the known continuation of @xmath305 to negative arguments .",
    "how to do this in the case of arbitrary @xmath105 is a bit more tricky . a way to do it relies on the remarkable fact that the integrals @xmath306 can be expressed in an almost closed form by appealing to techniques of jack polynomials @xcite .",

    "this expression can be used to compute the @xmath306 numerically to high values of @xmath105 , or , more fundamentally , to perform the analytic continuation in @xmath279 .",
    "i will not discuss this further , and get back now to the physics of this model .",
    "for @xmath301 at least , the perturbative expansion is well defined , giving a series in @xmath291 with positive coefficients .",
    "this series will presumably have a finite radius of convergence - although one does not expect the appearance of a singularity on the positive real axis ( this would correspond to the existence of a phase transition on the one dimensional boundary ) . beyond this radius ,",
    "some other technique has to be used to understand quantitatively what happens .",
    "it is possible to argue what the leading behaviour of the partition function at large @xmath291 should be .",
    "indeed , @xmath175 actually depends only on the ratio of the two energy scales @xmath310 and @xmath1 , so large @xmath291 is like small temperature .",
    "but small temperature corresponds , going back to an euclidean description , to a cylinder of large diameter . in this limit",
    ", the partition function per unit length of the boundary should have a well defined , `` thermodynamic '' limit , so @xmath175 should go as @xmath311 .",
    "this means our perturbative series has to go as @xmath312 .",
    "a natural idea to find out what happens beyond the radius of convergence is to think of the problem from a `` dual '' point of view , ie around the @xmath289 infra red fixed point . the first question one may ask is along which irrelevant operator this fixed point is approached .",
    "there are several , equally interesting ways to answer this question .",
    "the first one starts by considering the model where the bulk degrees of freedom have been integrated out , leading to the action ( at zero temperature , which makes the formulas a bit simpler ) s=12dydy^2 + dy(y)+m2dy(_y)^2 where we have added an irrelevant mass term to make some integrals finite .",

    "j f_ins(y - y_j ) the kinetic term of the action can be conveniently evaluated by fourier transform s_kin=|()|^2 ||d2 at large distances , one finds s_kin_j < k _",
    "j_k |y_j - y_k| this is in exact correspondence with the coulomb gas expansion discussed previously , but with the exchange @xmath314 .",
    "it follows that the ir action reads , at leading order s_-^0 dxdy + _ ddy ( 0,y),[bsgdual ] where we recall that @xmath315 is the dual of the boson @xmath48 .",
    "it follows that the ir fixed point is approached along an operator of dimension @xmath316 .",
    "one also checks that @xmath317 .",
    "it is important to stress now that , while the flow away from the uv fixed point is fully specified by a single perturbing term , the situation is very different for the approach towards the ir fixed point .",
    "of course , one is free if one wishes to perturb the d boundary conditions by a single irrelevant operator as represented in ( [ bsgdual ] ) , though of course one has to be especially careful in defining the theory because of the strong short distance divergences in the integrals .",
    "the point is , that there is only _",
    "one _ particular way of approaching the ir fixed point that corresponds to the trajectory originating at our uv fixed point .",
    "this means that the large @xmath291 behaviour of the series we are interested in would be computable from the knowledge of an action of the form s=12_-^0 dxdy + _ ddy ( 0,y)+_k ^h_k-1g-1 o_k[horridir ] , where @xmath318 belong to a very large class of operators allowed by symmetry : there are for instance all the @xmath319 , @xmath320 , and many others . since all these operators come with appropriately scaled powers of the coupling constant , they all give contributions to physical properties that depend on our single scaling variable @xmath321 , and no operator can be discarded ( let me stress that an expansion such as ( [ horridir ] ) does not make much sense until one specifies the regularization procedure employed ) .    here",
    "of course the reader should ask : but why did nt we add that collection of operators near the uv fixed point as well ?",
    "the point is that we had control of what we wanted to do near the uv fixed point , and only a maniac would want to use such an irrealistically finely tuned combination of operators to perturb a fixed point .",
    "however we have _ no _ control about the way the ir fixed point is approached : this is entirely determined by the dynamics of the quantum field theory , and it turns out to be quite complicated .",
    "it is important in particular to realize that , starting from ( [ horridir ] ) and trying to go against the renormalization group flow , there is , most probably , only _",
    "one _ choice of ir perturbation that would get back to our uv fixed point .",
    "it seems very hard to push the instanton expansion beyond the first non trivial order to try to get at ( [ horridir ] ) , or get the expansion of physical quantities for large @xmath291 : this has for a long time made ir perturbation theory impossible to carry out beyond the first trivial order .",
    "remarkably however,([horridir ] ) can be entirely determined using ideas of integrability . in a scheme",
    "where everything is dimensionally regularized , the only vertex operator that is present near the ir fixed point is @xmath322 : none of the other harmonics actually appear !",
    "there are also very strong constraints on the other operators .    in any case",
    ", the non - perturbative region of large @xmath291 is very hard to access quantitatively using perturbation of the ir fixed point .",
    "fortunately , the problem can be tackled by using ideas of integrability , a topic to which we will turn soon .",
    "clearly , the instanton expansion , if physically appealing , is a bit laborious , especially when one considers how little information it finally provides .",
    "the conformal invariance analysis gives an alternative way , usually more reliable , to know which operators are present near the ir fixed point .",
    "indeed , this information is encoded in the partition function @xmath323 ( [ dirich ] ) for @xmath324 : the modes in the sum correspond to operators with dimension @xmath325 , the cosines identified previously , while the other terms obtained by expanding the eta function correspond to powers of derivatives of the field .",
    "the constraint of integrability has been used with much success to study crossover scaling in bulk 2d theories exactly .",
    "however , it is often objected that integrable models are not so relevant for experimentally observable physics for at least two reasons :    ( a ) : in order to achieve integrability , extensive fine - tuning of parameters is often required .",
    "therefore , it is often believed that exact predictions made by studying an exactly integrable model might often not be generic and therefore difficult to observe experimentally .",
    "for example integrable spin chains with spin greater than @xmath326 are gapless , while the generic even - spin spin chain and those observed have gaps in the spectrum .",
    ".2 cm    ( b ) : a very important set of experimentally accessible observables are transport properties .",
    "amongst those is the conductance which is usually computed from ( equilibrium ) green s functions using the kubo - formula .",
    "it is usually very difficult or impossible to compute exact green s functions , even when the system is ( bethe - ansatz ) integrable .",
    "therefore , before the progress made in the last couple of years , integrability was largely restricted to the computation of thermodynamic quantities , excluding transport properties at finite temperature .",
    ".5 cm    in fact , the situation is quite different for integrable quantum impurity problems . for these problems ,",
    "exact transport properties can be computed ( even out of equilibrium ) and integrability can answer directly experimentally important questions .    in particular :",
    ".2 cm ( i ) : in order to achieve integrability in quantum impurity problems , one often needs to adjust very few parameters  sometimes none ! for instance , both the kondo effect and the point contacts in fractional quantum hall effect devices , provide an experimental realization of an integrable system without any fine - tuning .",
    "similarly , while integrable higher spin quantum spin chains are non generic , the higher spin kondo problem , is integrable .",
    ".2 cm ( ii ) : exact transport properties ( at non - zero temperature ) can be computed from integrability @xcite .",
    "the linear response conductance for the quantum hall point contact , for instance , agrees quantitatively with recent experiments by milliken / webb / umbach @xcite : this is the quantity we will discuss in what follows .",
    "many other properties can also be computed , and i will discuss them briefly at the end .",
    "the method to obtain those exact results is a bit unconventional : it relies crucially on a judicious choice of basis of the hilbert space of the system .",
    "we use a basis that is natural from the point of view of integrability .",
    "it is simply the basis in which all the infinite number of conservation laws ( that exist since we have an integrable system ) are diagonal .",
    "this basis turns out to have a `` fock - space '' like structure , i.e. it is spanned by `` quasiparticles '' .",
    "it is in this basis that the quantum impurity interaction becomes tractable . in order to compute transport properties",
    ", we use a kinetic equation for those quasiparticles of the bethe - ansatz .",
    "this is non - trivial , since we are really describing a fully interacting system , where a single - particle ( fermi - liquid ) concept such as a kinetic equation seems out of place , at first sight .",
    "the single particle kinetic equation would fail to produce exact results in interacting systems due to the existence of particle production processes in the single - particle basis . however , the quasiparticle basis dictated to us by integrability is precisely characterized by the absence of quasiparticle production ( and `` factorized scattering '' ) .",
    "this particular and special feature of an integrable theory , allows us to use a kinetic equation to compute transport properties exactly from integrability .",
    "a historical note is necessary here .",
    "the point of view i will use is different from the original works on integrable quantum impurity problems . in the latter works , the authors started from a `` bare '' theory , and proved by hand that there were simple eigenstates obtained by making a two body scattering ansatz , the bethe ansatz ( there wo nt be much about the bethe ansatz per se in these lectures ) .",
    "they then proceeded to build the `` physical '' theory by filling up the ground state , and studying excitations above it .",
    "nowadays , it has become customary to start directly with the physical theory , and prove its integrability using a very different and powerful tool that i will introduce below , perturbed conformal theory .",
    "the spectrum of excitations and the s matrix are then deduced ( some would say guessed ) by using symmetry arguments ; in particular by analyzing non local currents ( for this aspect , see eg @xcite ) .",
    "the approach gives rise somehow naturally to the computation of transport properties , in particular by making physical sense of massless scattering , and _ that _ has definitely been a progress .",
    "another key advantage is that , for a given `` physical '' theory , there are many possible `` bare '' choices , that is many different possible regularizations .",
    "usually only one of them is integrable , and not always the obvious one ; for instance , s. zamolodchikov showed in his pioneering work that the ising model at @xmath5 with a magnetic field is an integrable quantum field theory , but it is well known that its standard regularized square lattice version is _ not _ integrable ( in the case we are interested in , the boundary sine - gordon model , i am actually not aware of any simple integrable bare hamiltonian ) .",
    "all this is not to diminish the beauty and astonishing insight of the pioneering works about quantum impurity problems @xcite , nor the huge body of work on the bethe ansatz and yang baxter equation that it is impossible to even start to acknowledge here .",
    "as emphasized in the first sections , one of the main uses of conformal invariance is to provide a convenient basis to the hilbert space of observables in terms of representations of the infinite dimensional symmetry . for the free boson ,",
    "the basis furnished by irreducible representations of the virasoro algebra is just one of many choices : the basis furnished instead by representations of the heisenberg algebra is also possible , and sometimes more convenient .",
    "when one wishes to study the problem with a boundary interaction , the question arises , of which basis will be the most convenient to work .",
    "it turns out it is still a third choice , provided by a `` massless scattering theory '' . to understand what this means , it is good to first consider the classical case .    in the classical limit , one can scale the parameter @xmath327 off the action . going to real time ,",
    "one obtains a classical scalar field @xmath328 satisfying the klein - gordon equation in the bulk @xmath329 : _ t^2 - _",
    "x^2 = 0[kgeqn ] together with the boundary conditions ( where @xmath291 is also rescaled ) : ._x     now , the point is that the `` most natural '' basis of solutions for the bulk problem , that is plane waves , behaves badly with respect to the boundary interaction : if a plane wave is sent towards the boundary , what bounces back is a complicated superposition .",
    "is it possible to find a better basis made of wave packets that will bounce nicely ?    to find such a basis ,",
    "we make a detour through a more complicated problem which everybody knows is integrable , the massive sine - gordon model .",
    "that is , we want to think of our klein - gordon problem as the @xmath330 limit of the sine - gordon equation : _",
    "t^2 - _ x^2 = -()[sgeqn ] it turns out that this massive model , in the presence of the boundary interaction , is still integrable .",
    "we will discuss this point in more details below , and start instead by considering how things look like in the massless limit .",
    "there are two types of finite - energy solutions of the classical sine - gordon equation : solitons , which are time - independent and topologically non - trivial , and breathers , which are time - dependent and topologically trivial .",
    "intuitively , a breather can be thought of as a bound state of a kink and an antikink oscillating in and out ( i.e. breathing ) . here , we will discuss only the solitons ; the analysis for the breathers follows analogously .",
    "a major triumph of the theory of non - linear partial differential equations was the construction of explicit solutions of ( [ sgeqn ] ) for any number of moving solitons .",
    "the solitons energies and momenta are conveniently expressed in terms of rapidities @xmath331 , defined by @xmath332 and @xmath333 , @xmath334 .",
    "the velocity of each is thus given by @xmath335 ( positive for a right - moving soliton ) .",
    "we have set the speed of `` light '' to be 1 .",
    "consider now a two - soliton solution of ( [ sgeqn ] ) on @xmath336 .",
    "this solution is usually expressed as : ( x , t ) = 4  arg ( ) 4   ( i m ( ) e ( ) ) [ sgsoln ] where the @xmath337-function solution is given by : = 1 - & _ 1 _ 2 ( ) ^2  e^ - e_1 ( x - a ) - e_2 ( x - b ) + p_1 t + p_2 t + + & i [ twosols ] the constants @xmath50 and @xmath34 represent the initial positions of the two solitons , and @xmath338 if the @xmath339 soliton is a kink , while @xmath340 if it is an anti - kink .    what happens if we try to take the massless limit of this solution ?",
    "for a wavepacket to have finite energy in the massless limit @xmath341 , the rapidity @xmath342 must go to infinity .",
    "we thus define @xmath343 , and let @xmath344 such that the parameter @xmath345 remains finite . the energy and momentum of a right - moving `` massless '' soliton then reads e = p = m e^[dispi ] for a left mover , @xmath346 , and its energy and momentum read e =- p = m e^- .",
    "suppose that both of these solitons are right - moving",
    ". then the massless limit yields : = 1 - _ 1 _ 2 e^-e^ -e_1(- a ) -e_2(- b ) + i [ infrapid ] where @xmath347 and @xmath348.\\ ] ] this leads to an a priori strangely complicated solution of the klein - gordon equation .",
    "observe that : arg \\ { 1 - _ 1 _ 2",
    "e^ - e_1(- a ) - e_2(- b ) + i } + = arg + arg = ^-1+^-1[superpos ] this is easily checked to be the sum of two one - soliton solutions ; the factor @xmath349 thus measures the extent to which the two - soliton solution is _ not _ a superposition of one - soliton solutions .",
    "more precisely , consider the limit @xmath350 so that @xmath351 is finite .",
    "this corresponds to moving the first kink off to @xmath352 and following it .",
    "the @xmath337 function collapses to the one - kink form @xmath353 . moving this soliton through",
    "the second one corresponds to taking it to @xmath354 , or taking the limit @xmath355 ( with @xmath351 finite ) . discarding an overall multiplicative factor ( which is irrelevant in the computation of @xmath356 )",
    ", we see that in this limit , @xmath357 .",
    "thus these preferred klein - gordon wave packets exhibit _ non - trivial monodromy_. the foregoing time delay @xmath349 is precisely the classical form of a massless scattering matrix .",
    "one obtains the same @xmath349 for two left - moving solitons . for",
    "a left - moving and a right - moving soliton colliding one easily sees that the massless limit of @xmath358 is unity .",
    "the solution collapses to the superposition of a left - moving wave packet and a right - moving wave packet exactly as in ( [ superpos ] ) , with no time delay .",
    "this is the classical manifestation of the fact that the left - right quantum scattering matrix @xmath359 elements are at most rapidity - independent phase shifts .",
    "consider now the klein - gordon equation on @xmath360 $ ] with the boundary condition ( [ intbcs ] ) .",
    "here is a direct way of seeing the integrability of the klein - gordon ( and indeed , sine - gordon ) equation with boundary conditions ( [ intbcs ] ) .",
    "the idea is to show that the method of images can be used on @xmath336 even in the non - linear system , so as to replicate the boundary conditions ( [ intbcs ] ) on @xmath360 $ ] .",
    "the scattering of a kink , or anti - kink , from the boundary can be described by a three - soliton solution on @xmath336 .",
    "these three solitons consist of the incoming soliton , its mirror image with equal but opposite velocity , and a stationary soliton at the origin , to adjust the boundary conditions ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "if one takes the infinite rapidity limit of this three - soliton solution then the stationary soliton simply collapses to an overall shift of @xmath118 by a constant , while the mirror images ( since they are moving in opposite directions ) reduce to a superposition of two wave packets .",
    "one thus obtains : = _ 0 + 4   arg + 4   arg  [ bndryscatt ] where @xmath361 , @xmath362 . by direct computation",
    "one finds that this solution satifies ( [ intbcs ] ) with : e^e(a+b ) = - _ 1 _ 2   ( 2e+ ) ( 2e- ) [ twosolbc ] the constant @xmath363 represents the delay of the reflected pulse .",
    "if one defines the classical boundary scale @xmath364 via @xmath365 , then this delay may be written as _",
    "b = [ refdelay ] note that the sign @xmath366 is to be chosen so as to make the argument of the logarithm real .",
    "this determines whether the reflection of a kink will be a kink or an anti - kink .",
    "thus we see that @xmath364 is the scale at which behavior crosses over from the region of the neumann critical point ( where the classical boundary scattering is completely off - diagonal ) to the dirichlet boundary critical point ( where classical boundary scattering is diagonal ) .",
    "the conclusion of this section is clear : there are classical wave packets that scatter very nicely at the boundary .",
    "the price to pay is that they are considerably more complex than plane waves , and `` weakly interacting '' - that is , they scatter non trivially through one another .    the natural attitude after having established such results classically is to see whether they are preserved quantum mechanically .",
    "one can for instance establish integrability order by order in a loop expansion ( which here amounts to an expansion in powers of @xmath327 ) . here",
    "i want to show a more direct way to proceed , that generalizes to all sorts of theories .",
    "as in the previous section , we start by considering theories with a bulk interaction . all what follows is based on the very insightful work of a.b .",
    "zamolodchikov @xcite .",
    "consider therefore the usual sine - gordon model with action , so no counter term is necessary to define the perturbed action . only a finite number of such counter terms would be required in general anyway , because of the `` super - renormalizability '' common to most perturbed conformal field theories . ]",
    "s=12dxdy + dxdyas in the classical case , quantum integrability is established by proving the existence of non trivial integrals of motion . rather than doing perturbation around @xmath367 ,",
    "what one can do instead is perturbation around the conformal limit .",
    "this requires first the understanding that a conformal theory is integrable , a rather straightforward property .",
    "indeed , let us try to build a set of conserved quantities for a quantum field theory .",
    "we consider euclidian space with imaginary time in the @xmath19 - direction : a quantity will thus be conserved if its integral along two horizontal contours at different values of @xmath19 gives the same result . using complex coordinates , this will occur if we have a pair of quantities , say @xmath368 and @xmath369 such that @xmath370 . right at the conformal point , by analyticity , @xmath1 , all its derivatives and ( regularized ) powers , do provide conserved quantities .    to clarify this a little ,",
    "let us consider the classical case .",
    "going to imaginary time and complex coordinates , the equation of motion is = 4 * exercise : * show that the first pairs leading to conserved quantities are t_2=()^2 ,  _ 2=-2 + t_4=(^2)^2 - 14()^4 , _ 4 = 4()^2 , that is , the relation @xmath371 holds . go back to real time , and find out which quantity is , indeed , conserved by time evolution .",
    "away from the conformal point , what will happen is that there will sometimes be a deformation of ( some of ) these quantities that is still conserved . to see that ,",
    "let us start by looking at the stress energy tensor , and see what @xmath372 becomes with a perturbation .",
    "to make sense of this question , we have to insert @xmath1 inside a correlator , as usual .",
    "the difference with the conformal case is that now the action reads , quite generally s = s_cft+dxdy o so we have to expand the boltzmann weight in powers of @xmath373 .",
    "this gives an infinity of terms , each of which has now a boltzmann weight with a pure @xmath374 , so the results right at the conformal point can be used for them .",
    "but then it seems that @xmath1 being analytic at the conformal point , nothing will make it non analytic away from it !",
    "that is not true because of what happens at coincident points .",
    "the integral of the perturbing field will affect only the behaviour near @xmath66 , so we can use the ope of @xmath1 with the perturbation t(z)o(z,)=ho(z,)(z - z)^2+o(z,)z - z+  now , using the identity ( [ basicid ] ) it follows that t=(1-h ) o hence , for @xmath375 , @xmath376 , and we have a conserved quantity - to first order in @xmath373 that is . before wondering about higher orders , let us stress what ensured the existence of a conserved quantity : the fact that the residue of the simple pole of the ope of @xmath1 with the perturbation was a total derivative .",
    "one can then try to see whether there are other quantities for which a similar thing holds .",
    "let us consider therefore the combination @xmath377 .",
    "after laborious computation , one finds that the residue of the simple pole , in the sine - gordon case of interest , is @xmath378 which is a total derivative when ( notice this would still hold with @xmath327 subsituted with @xmath379 ) @xmath380 the same sort of argument can be built to show that a conserved quantity can be obtained for every even @xmath105 , which is the integral of a local field of dimension @xmath105 .",
    "we now have to discuss what happens beyond first order .",
    "suppose we carry out the computation to order @xmath105 ; a priori , we expect the result to be something like t_4=_4 + o(^n)[conservi ] where @xmath381 is of order one in @xmath373 .",
    "the left hand side has dimensions @xmath382 , while @xmath383 has dimensions @xmath384 .",
    "this means that a local field with dimensions @xmath385 has to appear multiplying the @xmath383 term . since @xmath386 ,",
    "only a finite number of cases allow a positive set of dimensions , and for each of these except @xmath303 , and for @xmath387 generic , one checks that there is no field with these dimensions .",
    "hence , the conservation at lowest order extends , generically , to conservation at arbitrary order .",
    "for instance , where now arbitrary orders are allowed in the right hand side of ( [ conservi ] ) ! ]",
    "this proves quantum integrability , perturbatively that is .",
    "finally , these conserved quantities also turn out to be in involution , ie they define mutually commuting operators . the proof is based on the jacobi identity , which implies that , if two conserved quantities do not commute , then their commutator is also a conserved quantity - a little more thinking then establishes this is not possible .",
    "i also would like to remark that in the early literature about quantum integrable models , there is the implicit `` suspicion '' that quantization might destroy integrability , ie reduce the classical symmetry of the theory .",
    "it is important to realize that such a thing is not always true .",
    "in fact , in two dimensions at least , the quantum theory often has more symmetry than the classical theory .",
    "the next step in the analysis of a massive integrable quantum field theory requires going to a scattering description @xcite .",
    "let us assume quite generally that we have massive particles distinguished by some label @xmath50 , with mass @xmath388 .",
    "we write their two momentum @xmath389 in terms of a rapidity variable @xmath140 : @xmath390 .",
    "we now consider scattering processes .",
    "there are the `` in - states '' , corresponding physically to a bunch of particles arranged on the x - axis by decreasing order of rapidities , which we describe formally by a ket @xmath391 . at large time , they give rise to `` out - states '' , formally described by @xmath392 , with an a priori different set of particles arranged on the x - axis by increasing order of , a priori different , rapidities ( see figure 11 ) .    both the in and the out states are a complete set of states in a local quantum field theory , and they are connected by the s - matrix .",
    "now , the existence of infinitely many conserved quantities has very drastic consequences on the scattering of these particles .",
    "indeed , the conserved quantities have to act simply on the multiparticles states - they are in fact proportional to the sums of odd powers of the momenutm . as a result , it follows that , in the scattering process :    @xmath6 the number of particles is conserved ; in fact , the number of particles of the same mass is conserved    @xmath7 the final set of two - momenta coincides with the initial set of two - momenta    from this in turn , it follows that the s matrix factorizes into a product of 2-body scattering processes . to see this ,",
    "consider for instance conjugating the s matrix by the operator @xmath393 .",
    "since the s matrix conserves momenta , it actually does commute with this operator , so we do nt change anything . on the other hand , the operator has a non trivial physical action : it changes the space time coordinates of particle 1 .",
    "if we chose @xmath394 appropriately , we can arrange for particle @xmath395 to scatter with the other particles only after they are very highly separated , so the scattering of this particle is a succession of two particle scatterings . by proceeding inductively ,",
    "one deduces that indeed , the s matrix factorizes .",
    "moreover , for the whole thing to be consistent , the scattering must be `` associative '' ; that is , the scattering of three particles can be decomposed into three pairwise scatterings , with a result independent of which particular decomposition is used .",

    "it becomes more interesting in the case where several particles have the same mass , but differ by some other quantum number , eg the charge . in general , we define the s matrix elements by the relation ( figure 13 ) |_1,_2>^in_a_1,a_2=s_a_1a_2^a_1,a_2 |_1,_2>^out _ a_1,a_2[smatdef ]    relativistic invariance contrains the s matrix to depend on the difference of rapidities @xmath396 .    in the case of the sine - gordon model , perturbation in @xmath327 , considerations of ( quantum affine ) symmetry ,",

    "exercise : * show that ( [ sixvrmat ] ) gives rise , indeed , to a solution of the yang baxter equation .",
    "hint : proceed graphically as sketched in figure 15 - to represent the matrix multiplications of yb , simply draw all the physical processes that connect a given pair of initial and final states , and add up their amplitudes .",
    "the function @xmath408 is a normalization factor , which can be written as @xmath409}\\exp\\left(i \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } { dy\\over 2y } \\sin { 2\\a\\gamma y \\over\\pi } { \\sinh [ ( \\gamma-1)y ]   \\over \\sinh y\\cosh(\\gamma y ) } \\right).\\ ] ] the breather - kink and breather - breather @xmath116 matrices are well known ; we do not write them down here ( see below for some examples , and in the appendix ) .",
    "these s matrices of course are not only characterized by the fact that they must solve the yang - baxter equation : there are several other physical requirements , like unitarity and crossing symmetry . in the formula above , these translate into the relations a()=b(i- ) + c()=c(i- ) form which unitarity @xmath410 follows .",
    "in addition , one must have a `` closed bootstrap '' : for instance , breathers appear as poles in the kink antikink scattering , and their s matrix can be computed using this fact ( for a review see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath411 is an integer , the bulk scattering is diagonal ( @xmath103 vanishes ) and @xmath412 .",
    "therefore , the only allowed processes are transmissions : particles go through one another without exchanging quantum numbers .",
    "this is the simplest case , to which we will restrict in what follows .",
    "it is reasonable to think of the s matrix , together with the mass spectrum , as the quantum equivalent of the knowledge of the @xmath337 function in the classical case .",
    "we can then take the massless limit exactly as we did before , by letting the mass parameter @xmath413 , and at the same time boosting the rapidities .",
    "one obtains then a collection of left and right moving kinks , antikinks and breathers .",
    "the ll and rr scattering matrices take exactly the same expressions as in the massive case in terms of the new rapidities @xmath414 , while the lr s matrices go to constants , which can in most cases just be forgotten .",
    "this provides an alternative description of the free boson in terms of `` massless scattering '' .",
    "we will see in a little while how quantities of the conformal field theory can be recovered , if one wishes , within that description .",
    "it is fair to stress here that the rr or ll scattering are hard to make sense of in the context of a true , physical scattering process .",
    "if particles have the label r say , this means they are moving at the speed of light in the right direction , so , for instance , all the lines in the figure 11 which illustrates the yang baxter equation become parallel ! the point is that the scattering has to be interpreted in the massless limit as a set of commutation relations for creation operators , an idea which we will discuss below .",
    "the idea of massless scattering appeared a bit weird at the beginning @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , but its predictive power and favorable comparison with experiments gained it respectability quickly .",
    "a more rigorous approach along the lines of lattice regularizations is proposed in @xcite .",
    "for the moment , we finish following the logic of the classical analysis in the quantum case .",
    "first , one can prove that the quantum sine - gordon model with a bulk _ and _ boundary interaction s=12_-^0 dxdy + dy(0,y ) .[sgbsg ] allows the existence of conserved quantities as well @xcite .",
    "the proof proceeds in the same spirit as for the bulk case , and we are not going to reproduce it here , though it is an excellent exercise for the diligent reader .    * exercise : * show that , in the classical theory , the pair @xmath415 still leads to a conserved quantity provided there exists still another local quantiy @xmath416 such that .t_4+|_2-|t_4-_2|_x=0=ddy_3 show then , that for the sine - gordon model with a potential @xmath417 $ ] at the boundary , only the choice @xmath418 allows the existence of the integral of motion .",
    "integrability means that the particles also have to scatter nicely at the boundary , ie scatter one by one , without particle production , in a way that is compatible with the bulk scattering .",
    "this latter condition can simply be expressed graphically as shown on figure 16 , and corresponds to the `` boundary yang - baxter '' equation .",
    "the problem of determining the reflection matrix is purely technical .",
    "it does have quite a simple answer in the massless limit .",
    "introduce r_+-()=r_-+()=-i()1-i ( ) + r_++()=r_()=11-i()where @xmath419 is a phase that will disappear at the end of the computations , @xmath401 . the reflection matrix for coupling @xmath291 is then given by @xmath420 where @xmath421 ( the exact correspondence depends on the regularization scheme ; it is given in @xcite in the case of dimensional regularization ) is the equivalent of the kondo temperature . as @xmath422 , @xmath423 ( the scattering is completely off - diagonal ) corresponding to neumann boundary conditions , while as @xmath424 , @xmath425 ( the scattering is completely diagonal ) corresponding to dirichlet boundary conditions .",

    "such a formula does not hold in the present case : the fluctuations of the various species are correlated - their computation plays an important role in the dc noise at non vanishing temperature and voltage , see @xcite .",

    "now @xmath530 is essentially the charge of the even field in the manipulations discussed in the introduction , which we found has no dynamic indeed .",

    "more precisely , when a kink comes in and bounces back as an antikink , as happens most of the time near the uv fixed point ( neumann boundary conditions ) , the charge @xmath534 is conserved in the original problem . on the other hand ,",
    "when a kink bounces back as a kink , as happens near the ir fixed point ( dirichlet boundary conditions ) , the charge in the original problem is not conserved ; rather , @xmath535 .",
    "let me stress here that the kink in the boundary sine - gordon theory however would look horribly complicated in the original problem , because the changes of variables we have performed are non local . only the conserved _ charge",

    "of course , if there are as many particles of each specie , no current is transported overall .",
    "if however , a voltage @xmath12 is applied , kink and antikink are at a different chemical potential , @xmath536 - this follows since the @xmath537 charge in the boundary sine - gordon model is nothing but the physical charge @xmath534 .",
    "the current that flows through the system is thus i=_-^(_+-_-)()dwe can use our tba to evaluate this expression quickly .",
    "first , we introduce the filling fractions f_=11+e^(_)/t second , we observe that the very convenient identity @xmath538 holds , and that , moreover , @xmath539 .",

    "one finds in fact , solving again ( [ universal ] ) but with a voltage , e^_n(-)/t=^2 - 1 ,  e^_(-)/t=(t-1)v/2ttv/2tt ( observe one recovers the result ( [ xsols ] ) as @xmath543 ) from which an elementary computation shows the simple result ( recall @xmath544 ) i = gv2 the bizarre factor of @xmath230 occurs here because we have set @xmath545 ( recall that in physical units , @xmath546 ) .      this is what one expected , and of course there are quicker ways to derive this result .",
    "the point however , is that the same computation carries over without much additional difficulty to the case where the impurity is present .      in the general case ,",
    "we will write the source drain current as @xmath547 where @xmath548 is the current in the absence of backscattering , and @xmath549 is the backscattered current . in the original problem",
    ", @xmath549 is for instance the rate at which the charge of the right moving edge is depleted . of course ,",
    "@xmath550 in each hopping event , so @xmath551 . in the steady state",
    "this rate is constant .",
    "when for instance @xmath12 is positive , there are more kinks than antikinks injected with a thermal distribution into the system from their respective infinite reservoirs ; it is assumed that these reservoirs are so big that the backscattering does not change their properties .",
    "we now derive an analytic expression for this backscattering current using a kinetic rate equation for quasiparticles of the bethe ansatz .",
    "it is possible to compute the rate of change of @xmath552 in the basis of the bethe ansatz quasiparticles , since each scattering event of a kink ( antikink ) into an antikink ( kink ) changes the physical charge @xmath552 by @xmath553 ( by @xmath554 ) .",
    "this kinetic equation is of course very familiar .",
    "however , in general there would be no reason why it should be applicable to an interacting system .",
    "but it is exact in the case that we are considering , even though the system is interacting .",
    "the reason for this lies in the constraints of integrability : as discussed above , in the very special quasiparticle basis of the bethe ansatz , these quasiparticles scatter off of the point contact independently ( `` one - by - one '' ) , and all quasiparticle production processes are absent .",
    "this allows us to express the rate of change in @xmath555 , in terms of the transition probability @xmath556 ( recall that in the unfolded point of view @xmath557 ) and the number of kinks and antikinks ( carriers of charge @xmath558 ) in the rapidity range between @xmath476 and @xmath559 @xmath560 where @xmath561 is the density of states and @xmath562 are the filling fractions .",
    "the number of kinks of rapidity @xmath476 that scatter into antikinks per unit time is    probability that the initial kink state is filled and the final antikink state is empty ( in all these quantities , there is also a @xmath12 dependence , which we keep implicit here ) . for a system of free fermions we would have @xmath563 but in our interacting system we only have @xmath564 where @xmath565 is the probability that _ both _ , the kink and the antikink states are filled . for the number of antikinks of rapidity @xmath476 that scatter into kinks per unit time one finds a formula similar to ( [ rateplusminus ] ) , with @xmath566 . in the final rate equation , only the difference between these two probabilities @xmath567 appears .",
    "notice that the unknown @xmath568 has cancelled out ( it can in fact be determined by techniques more elaborate than the tba @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the backscattering current is i_b(v ) = - d   n ( )    formula are exactly known : the scattering matrix has a simple analytic form and the occupation factors and densities of state are obtained exactly from the thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) .",
    "notice that this equation is valid for any value of the driving voltage @xmath12 .",
    "it thus automatically describes non - equilibrium transport .    by the same manipulations as before",
    ", it then follows that i=12_-^(f_+-f_-)|t_++|^2 ddd = t2_-^dof special interest is the linear conductance , which we obtain by taking a derivative at @xmath569 ; this gives , after reinserting the factor @xmath230 , g=(t-1)2_-^d the resulting curve is shown in figure 17 , together with experimental results @xcite and the results of monte carlo simulations @xcite , for @xmath459 .",
    "the agreement with the simulations is clearly very good ( the is one and only one fitting parameter - the horizontal scale - , accounting for the unknown , non universal ratio of the experimental gate voltage ( a `` bare '' quantity ) to the parameter @xmath291 in our renormalized field theory ) .",
    "as far as the experimental data go , it is also very satisfactory , except in the strong backscattering regime .",
    "recall however that the field theoretic prediction holds true only in the scaling limit : the experimental data are still quite scattered for low values of @xmath570 , indicating that this limit is not reached yet - actually the `` noise '' is of the same order of magnitude as the discrepancy from the theoretical curve , as reasonably expected .",
    "* exercise : * the problem had been solved previously @xcite in the simplest case of @xmath304 , where one can refermionize the hamiltonian for the boson @xmath46 .",
    "look at this solution , and compare with what we have just done : what is the meaning of kink and antikink , what is the bulk scattering , the boundary scattering ?",
    "these lectures have stopped short of really tackling the problem of boundary fixed points classification .",
    "equipped with what you learned here , you should not have much difficulty reading the paper of j. cardy on boundary states @xcite .",
    "this paves the way to questions that are still open .",
    "for instance , the problem we have studied at length generalizes , for tunneling in quantum wires where the spin of the electrons has to be taken into account , to a `` double sine - gordon problem '' , involving two bosons .",
    "surprisingly it has been shown @xcite that new non trivial fixed points do exist in that case , besides the obvious neumann and dirichlet possibilities . with a few exceptions",
    "@xcite , @xcite , nobody knows how these fixed points precisely look like ! as i will mention again below , what we have discussed is also very close to the kondo problem . you can learn more about fixed points and conformal invariance by reading the papers of affleck and ludwig on the multichannel kondo problem @xcite .",
    "there , you will also discover an aspect that i have neglected by lack of space : how multipoint correlators can be evaluated at fixed points by further using conformal invariance @xcite .",
    "the integrable approach can also be pushed further to allow the computation of ac properties , together with space and time dependent green functions , in the cross - over regime .",
    "the idea here still relies on massless scattering ; but now , one has to evaluate matrix elements of physical operators , and these are usually pretty complicated .",
    "moreover , an infinity of these matrix elements are a priori needed : for instance , the current operator is able to create _ any _ neutral configurations of quasiparticles out of the vacuum !",
    "it turns out however that , first , the matrix elements can be determined by algebraic techniques @xcite , @xcite ( the latter reference is recomended as a first reading ; the first is a bit hard to read ) , and second , in many cases , only a few of these matrix elements are required to obtain controlled accuracy all the way from the uv to the ir fixed point . using that technique , for instance",
    "the current current correlator itself can be evaluated , at least at @xmath571 @xcite ( there does remain a non trivial dependence upon space , time , and the coupling @xmath291 ) .",
    "determining correlators with a finite temperature or voltage is still more difficult ; some progress in that direction has been made @xcite , @xcite , but a lot remains to be done .",
    "in another direction , for those of you who are more formally oriented , it should be clear that what i just described is the tip of an iceberg of beautiful mathematical structures : see @xcite,@xcite and the series @xcite .",
    "let me just mention here that the kondo problem , which would be described by @xmath572 + \\lambda \\left(s^+e^{-i\\beta\\phi(0)/2}+s^-e^{i\\beta\\phi(0)/2}\\right),\\ ] ] is just around the corner : it actually does have deep relations with the boundary sine - gordon model , and with the subject of quantum monodromy operators .",
    "especially exciting results have actually appeared recently , concerning an exact duality between the uv and ir regimes of the problem @xcite,@xcite , and exhibiting tantalizing relations with the recent breakthroughs in 4d susy gauge theories @xcite .",
    "it is also fair to stress that the methods developed within the context of quantum impurity problems can be generalized to different systems of physical interest in @xmath0 dimensions : an example is the amazing recent mapping of the two - ladder problem onto an @xmath573 gross neveu model @xcite .",
    "it is very likely indeed that more such problems are awaiting us in the near future .    finally , the traditional question is , can any of this be generalized to more than @xmath0 ?",
    "well , the recent excitments in string theory are centered around somewhat similar ideas in @xmath574 , where , roughly , integrability is replaced by supersymmetry , an incredibly powerful tool . as for @xmath575 ,",
    "i do nt quite think it s over yet .",

    "<S> these are lectures presented at the les houches summer school `` topology and geometry in physics '' , july 1998 . </S>",
    "<S> they provide a simple introduction to non perturbative methods of field theory in @xmath0 dimensions , and their application to the study of strongly correlated condensed matter problems - in particular quantum impurity problems . </S>",
    "<S> the level is moderately advanced , and takes the student all the way to the most recent progress in the field : many exercises and additional references are provided .    in the first part , </S>",
    "<S> i give a sketchy introduction to _ conformal field theory_. </S>",
    "<S> i then explain how boundary conformal invariance can be used to classify and study low energy , strong coupling fixed points in quantum impurity problems . in the second part , </S>",
    "<S> i discuss _ quantum integrability _ from the point of view of perturbed conformal field theory , with a special emphasis on the recent ideas of massless scattering . </S>",
    "<S> i then explain how these ideas allow the computation of ( experimentally measurable ) transport properties in cross - over regimes . </S>",
    "<S> the case of edge states tunneling in the fractional quantum hall effect is used throughout the lectures as an example of application .    </S>",
    "<S> 1.cm -1 cm    * introduction *    quantum impurity problems have been for many years , and increasingly so recently , a favorite subject of investigations , for theorists and experimentalists alike . </S>",
    "<S> there are many good reasons for that .    </S>",
    "<S> first , these problems often represent the simplest setting in which some qualitatively fascinating physical properties can be observed and probed . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the kondo model ( for a comprehensive review , consult @xcite ) provides a clear cut example of asymptotic freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the basic experimental fact is that normal metals with dilute impurities exhibit an unusual minimum in the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity . </S>",
    "<S> the ultimate explanation is that the interaction of the electrons with the impurity spins produces an _ increase _ of the resistivity as @xmath1 is lowered , counteracting the usual _ decrease _ in resistivity arising from interactions with lattice phonons . </S>",
    "<S> low temperature means low energy , or large distance : we thus have a problem where interactions _ increase _ at large distance , a characteristic of asymptotic freedom . as another example i would like to mention the recent experiments @xcite about point contact tunneling in the fractional quantum hall effect ( for a review on this active topic , see @xcite ) at filling fraction @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> measurments of the shot noise reveal a behaviour @xmath3 in the limit of weak backscattering , where few quasiparticles tunnel , and do so independently . </S>",
    "<S> if one compares this formula with the standard schottky formula for fermi liquids , one sees that this noise has to be due to the tunneling of _ fractional charges _ @xmath4 : although the existence of these ( laughlin quasiparticles ) had been conjectured for a long time , the noise is the first direct evidence of their existence . as a final example , let me recall that the basic archetype of dissipative quantum mechanics ( for a review , look at @xcite , @xcite ) , the two state problem coupled to a bath of oscillators with ohmic dissipation , is described by another quantum impurity problem : the anisotropic kondo model . </S>",
    "<S> crucial fundamental issues are at stake here , as well as a large array of applications in chemistry and biology .    </S>",
    "<S> the second reason of our fascination for quantum impurity problems is that they are , to a large extent , manageable by analytic methods . </S>",
    "<S> this has led to incredibly fruitful progress in the past . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the renormalization group was , to a large extent , borne out of the efforts of kondo , anderson and wilson to understand the low temperature behaviour of the kondo model ( see @xcite ) . also , the works of andrei @xcite , wiegmann @xcite and others showed that the bethe ansatz could be used to analyze situations of experimental relevance : this spurred a new interest in quantum integrable models , an area which , together with its various off - springs like quantum groups , knot theory and others , has become one of most lively in mathematical physics .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , it is fair to say that quantum impurity problems are not only of fundamental interest : they are at the center of the most challenging problems of today s condensed matter , like kondo lattices , heavy fermions , and , maybe , high @xmath5 superconductors .    </S>",
    "<S> in these lectures , i will concentrate on what is usually considered the most important about quantum impurity problems : their properties as strongly interacting systems . </S>",
    "<S> there is no doubt that strongly correlated electrons are of the highest interest . on the practical side , besides high @xmath5 superconductivity , let me mention the remarkable recent developments in manufacturing and understanding small systems like quantum wires , carbon nanotubes and the like , where , because of the reduced dimensionality , fermi liquid theory is not applicable , and the interactions have to be taken into account non perturbatively . on a more fundamental level , strongly interacting systems exhibit rather counter intuitive properties , the most spectacular being probably spin charge separation . </S>",
    "<S> it is a challenge for the theorist to understand these properties , and quantum impurity problems no doubt provide the best theoretical and experimental laboratory to do so .    </S>",
    "<S> maybe it is time now to define what i mean by a quantum impurity problem . the general class of systems i have in mind have the following features : @xmath6 there are extended gapless ( critical ) quantum mechanical degrees of freedom , which live in an infinite spatial volume , the `` bulk '' @xmath7 these interact with an impurity , localized at one point in position space </S>",
    "<S> . this impurity may carry quantum mechanical degrees of freedom .    to have an example in mind , consider the kondo problem : ( i ) the extended degrees of freedom are those of the bulk metal . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a fermi surface means that the metal sits at a rg fixed point ( see e.g. @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> physically this is easily understood since the system of electrons has ( `` particle - hole '' ) excitations of arbitrarily low energy about its fermi - sea ground state , providing the critical degrees of freedom in the bulk of the metal ( ii ) the impurity spin , located at one point in space ( say the origin ) , is a dynamical quantum mechanical degree of freedom ( the dynamical process is the spin - flip ) .    in the kondo model </S>",
    "<S> we also see another feature of quantum impurity problems : they are generically one - dimensional . </S>",
    "<S> the problem of an impurity in a luttinger liquid to be discussed below is inherently one - dimensional , but the kondo model needs to be reduced to one dimension . </S>",
    "<S> since the impurity spin sits only at one point in space , it is only the s - wave wavefunctions of the metal electrons that can interact with the spin . </S>",
    "<S> second - quantizing this s - wave theory , we get a ( non - interacting ) quantum field theory of one - dimensional fermions , defined on half - infinite ( radial ) position space ( a half - infinite line ) , which interacts with the quantum spin at the end of the line . considering a path - integral representation of the 1d theory of fermions </S>",
    "<S> , we have a @xmath8-dimensional lagrangian field theory , one dimension from the ( half - infinite ) radial space coordinate , and another dimension from the ( say , euclidean ) time coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> all interactions take place at one point in space , the end of the line , where the impurity is located . in the @xmath8 dimensional space - time picture </S>",
    "<S> , the impurity sits at the `` boundary '' of space - time , which can be viewed as the upper - complex plane , the `` boundary '' being the real axis ( these points of view are schematically illustrated in figure 1 and 2 ) </S>",
    "<S> . this will be the general picture that we use in the study of all quantum impurity problems .    in the kondo problem </S>",
    "<S> we see one way how a quantum impurity problem can be realized experimentally : a bulk system ( here the 3d metal ) contains a finite but small concentration @xmath9 of quantum impurities . in the limit of </S>",
    "<S> very dilute impurities ( @xmath10 ) the impurities do not interact with each other ( to lowest order in @xmath9 ) , and the single - impurity theory may be used to describe the physics of the bulk material in the presence of dilute impurities . </S>",
    "<S> actually , experiments performed at very low concentrations are known to be in good agreement with the single - impurity theory for the ordinary ( one - channel ) kondo model .    </S>",
    "<S> a quite different realization of quantum impurity models occurs in the context of point contacts . </S>",
    "<S> these are basically electronic devices : two leads ( capable of transporting electrical current ) are attached to a single quantum impurity . </S>",
    "<S> each one of the leads is connected to a battery , so that electrical current is driven through the quantum impurity . </S>",
    "<S> one can then measure experimentally the electrical current @xmath11 , flowing through the quantum impurity , as a function of the applied driving voltage @xmath12 ( from the battery ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath13 curve , the differential ( non - linear ) conductance @xmath14 , or the temperature dependence of the linear response conductance @xmath15 are examples of experimental probes characteristic of the quantum impurity . </S>",
    "<S> notice that since the @xmath13 curve as well as the differential conductance are non - equilibrium properties , the point - contact realizations of quantum impurity problems are theoretically more challenging than other realizations , in that more than equilibrium statistical mechanics is involved to achieve a theoretical understanding of these quantities .    </S>",
    "<S> ideally , the most interesting point contact situation would involve one - dimensional leads , where electrons are described by the luttinger model , the simplest non - fermi - liquid metals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it consists of left- and right - moving gapless excitations at the two fermi points in an interacting 1-dimensional electron gas . in the past , this model had been difficult to realize experimentally however . </S>",
    "<S> this is simply because in a one - dimensional conductor ( such as a quasi - one - dimensional quantum wire so thin that the transverse modes are frozen out at low temperature ) , random impurities occur in the fabrication . </S>",
    "<S> these impurities lead to localization due to backscattering processes between the excitations at the two fermi points . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the random impurities generate a mass gap for the fermions .    </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , there is another possiblity : the edge excitations at the boundary of samples prepared in a fractional quantum hall state should be extremely clean realizations of the luttinger non - fermi liquids , as was observed by wen @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to quantum wires , these are stable systems because for @xmath16 an odd integer , the excitations only move in one direction on a given edge . </S>",
    "<S> since the right and left edges are far apart from each other , backscattering processes due to random impurities in the bulk can not localize those extended edge states . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the luttinger interaction parameter is universally related to the filling fraction @xmath17 of the quantum hall state in the bulk sample by a topological argument based on the underlying chern - simons theory , and does therefore not renormalize . </S>",
    "<S> the edge states should thus provide an extremely clean experimental realization of the luttinger model .    </S>",
    "<S> we now describe an experimental set - up in more details @xcite ( see figure 3 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> a fractional quantum hall state with filling fraction @xmath18 is prepared in the bulk of a quantum hall bar which is long in the @xmath9-direction and short in the @xmath19-direction . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the bulk quantum hall state is prepared in a hall insulator state ( longitudinal conductivity @xmath20 ) , and that the ( bulk ) hall resistivity is on the @xmath18 plateau where @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by adjusting the applied magnetic field , perpendicular to the plane of the bar . </S>",
    "<S> since the plateau is broad , the applied magnetic field can be varied over a significant range without affecting the filling of @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> next , a gate voltage @xmath22 is applied perpendicular to the long side of the bar , i.e. in the @xmath19 direction at @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> this has the effect of bringing the right and left moving edges close to each other near @xmath23 , forming a point contact . </S>",
    "<S> away from the contact there is no backscattering ( i.e. no tunneling of charge carriers ) because the edges are widely separated , but now charge carriers can hop from one edge to the other at the point contact .    the left - moving ( upper ) edge of the hall bar can now be connected to battery on the right such that the charge carriers are injected into the left - moving lead of the hall bar with an equilibrium thermal distribution at chemical potential @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the right - moving carriers ( propagating in the lower edge ) are injected from the left , with a thermal distribution at chemical potential @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the difference of chemical potentials of the injected charge carriers is the driving voltage @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath27 , there are more carriers injected from the left than from the right , and a `` source - drain '' current flows from the left to the right , along the @xmath9-direction of the hall bar . in the absence of the point contact , the driving voltage places the right and left edges at different potentials ( in the @xmath19-direction , perpendicular to the current flow ) , implying that the ratio of source - drain current to the driving voltage @xmath12 is the hall conductance @xmath28 ( both in linear response and at finite driving voltage @xmath12 ) </S>",
    "<S> when the point - contact interaction is included , at finite driving voltage , more of the right moving carriers injected from the left are backscattered than those injected from the right , resulting in a loss of charge carriers from the source - drain current . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we write the total source - drain current as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the ( negative ) backscattering current , quantifying the loss of current due to backscattering at the point contact . </S>",
    "<S> it is this backscattering current that i ultimately want to show how to compute .    </S>",
    "<S> let me write up some formulas as a preamble . </S>",
    "<S> i will not have time in these lectures to discuss bosonization or edge states in the fractional quantum hall effect : i will thus simply claim that , in its bosonized form , the problem is described by the hamiltonian @xmath31 + \\lambda \\cos{\\beta\\over \\sqrt{2}}(\\phi_l-\\phi_r)(0),\\ ] ] where @xmath32 . here </S>",
    "<S> , the free boson part describes the massless edge states @xcite , and the cosine term describes the effect of the gate voltage , with @xmath33 . in general of course </S>",
    "<S> , the backscattering term induced by this gate voltage should be represented by a complicated interaction ; but we keep only the most relevant term ( the only one for @xmath2 ) , which is all that matters in the scaling regime ( see below ) we will be interested in .    the interaction is a relevant term , that is , in a renormalization group transformation , one has , @xmath34 being the rescaling factor , so our relevant operator corresponds to a negative beta - function , ie an asymptotically free theory . ] = ( 1-)+o(^3 ) this means that at large gate voltage , or , equivalently , at small temperature ( since then , elementary excitations have low energies , so the barrier appears big to them ) , the point contact will essentially split the system in half , and no current will flow through.@xcite : compare with the effects of barriers on non - interacting electrons you studied in first year quantum mechanics . ] the questions the theorist wants to answer are : how do we study the vicinity of the weak - backscattering limit ? how do we find out more precisely what the strong back - scattering limit looks like ? </S>",
    "<S> how about its vicinity ? finally , can we be more ambitious and compute say the current at any temperature , voltage and gate voltage ?    for this latter question , </S>",
    "<S> let me stress that we are interested in the universal , or scaling , regime , which is the only case where things will not depend in an complicated way on the microscopic details of the gate and other experimental parameters . in practice , what the experimentalist will do is first sweep through values of the gate voltage , the conductance signal showing a number of resonance peaks , which sharpen as the temperature is lowered . </S>",
    "<S> these resonance peaks occur for particular values @xmath35 of the gate voltage , due to tunneling through localized states in the vicinity of the point contact . </S>",
    "<S> ideally , on resonance , the source - drain conductance is equal to the hall conductance without point contact , i.e. @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> this value is independent of temperature , on resonance . </S>",
    "<S> now , measuring for instance the linear response conductance as a function of the gate voltage near the resonance , i.e. as a function of @xmath37 , at a number of different temperatures @xmath1 , one gets resonance curves , one for each temperature . </S>",
    "<S> these peak at @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , these conductance curves should collapse , in the limit of very small @xmath1 and @xmath39 , onto a single universal curve when plotted as a function of @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> this is what the field theorist wants to compute .    </S>",
    "<S> to proceed , it is useful to formulate the problem as a boundary problem . </S>",
    "<S> for this , a few manipulations are needed . </S>",
    "<S> we decompose @xmath41 and set . </S>",
    "<S> then , all the quantities are evaluated within the free theory , on which one can legitimately do all the foldings , left right decompositions , etc . ] : @xmath42 \\nonumber\\\\ \\varphi^o(x+t)={1\\over\\sqrt{2}}\\left[\\phi_l(x , t)-\\phi_r(-x , t)\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] observe that these two fields are left movers . </S>",
    "<S> we now fold the system by setting , for @xmath43  : @xmath44 and introduce new fields @xmath45 , both defined on the half infinite line @xmath43 . the odd field @xmath46 simply obeys dirichlet boundary conditions at the origin @xmath47 , and decouples from the problem . </S>",
    "<S> the field @xmath46 , which we call rather @xmath48 in the following , has a non trivial dynamics @xmath49 </S>",
    "<S> + \\lambda \\cos\\frac{\\beta\\phi(0)}{2}.\\ ] ] the aspects we have to understand are , by increasing order of complexity : the fixed points , their vicinity , and what is in between . </S>",
    "<S> this is the order i will follow in these lectures .    </S>",
    "<S> the first difficulty one encounters in that field is how to describe the low energy fixed points . </S>",
    "<S> this may sound rather simple in the tunneling problem , but in other cases , for instance in a tunneling problem for electrons with spin , the matter is quite involved . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this is , that fixed points are not necessarily described in terms of nice linear boundary conditions for the bulk degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> it does seem to be true however , that even if the quantum impurity has internal degrees of freedom , interaction and renormalization effects do turn the dynamical quantum impurity into a boundary condition on the extended bulk degrees of freedom , at large distances , low energy or low temperature . at low temperatures </S>",
    "<S> the system may be in the strong coupling regime ( for instance , this is where kondo s result diverges ) . </S>",
    "<S> the boundary condition is thus a way to think about the strongly interacting system . </S>",
    "<S> nozires physical picture of screening @xcite illustrates how this works for the simplest case , the one - channel kondo model : the antiferromagnetic interaction of the impurity spin with the spin of the conduction electrons , which has renormalized to large values at low temperatures , causes complete screening of the impurity spin . </S>",
    "<S> a modified boundary condition on the electrons that are not involved in the screening , is left . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism , however , appears to be much more general , and seems to apply to all quantum impurity problems .    </S>",
    "<S> the boundary conditions generated in this process may be highly non - trivial ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , since the bulk is massless ( critical ) , the induced boundary condition is scale invariant asymptotically at large distances and low temperatures . actually , it is , in most cases , conformally invariant .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum impurity problems are thus intimately related with scale - invariant boundary conditions : these are rg fixed points , and , like in bulk @xmath0 quantum field theories , ( recall that the bulk is always critical in the type of systems that we are considering here ) , conformal symmetry is the best way to describe them .    </S>",
    "<S> now , conformal invariance is a long story . </S>",
    "<S> all i can do is provide , in the next sections , what i believe is the minimal set of ideas necessary to understand what is going on , and tackle without fear the literature on the subject . </S>",
    "<S> in several instances , i will have to discard entire discussions of key issues , substituting them with some intuitive comments , and only providing the final result . </S>",
    "<S> additional bits and pieces are then provided in the text in small characters , together with specific references , to help the reader bridge the gaps . </S>",
    "<S> good reviews on this subject are the les houches lectures of 1988 @xcite , the article by j. cardy @xcite , the lectures by j. polchinski @xcite , and the textbook @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . the relevant chapters in @xcite can also be quite useful .    in the following , i will intimately mix path integral and hamiltonian points of view . </S>",
    "<S> the two are of course equivalent , but each has its own advantages . </S>"
