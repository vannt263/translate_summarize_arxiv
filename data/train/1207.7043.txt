    "ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions provide a unique environment to study the properties of strongly interacting matter at high temperature and high energy density  @xcite .",
    "one of the crucial probes of this strongly interacting matter are di - lepton measurements in the low and intermediate mass region",
    ". di - leptons are not affected by the strong interaction once produced , therefore they can probe the whole evolution of the collision .    in the low invariant mass range of produced lepton pairs ( @xmath3 gev/@xmath4 ) , we can study vector meson in - medium properties through their di - lepton decays , where modifications of mass and width of the spectral functions observed may relate to the possibility of chiral symmetry restoration  @xcite . at the sps , the low mass di - lepton enhancement in the ceres @xmath5 data  @xcite and in the na60 @xmath6 data  @xcite requires substantial medium effects on the @xmath7-meson spectral function .",
    "the precise na60 measurement of the low mass enhancement provides a decisive discrimination between a dropping - mass scenario  @xcite and a massively broadened spectral function  @xcite .",
    "the latter one was found to be able to consistently describe the data .",
    "the di - lepton spectra in the intermediate mass range ( @xmath8 gev/@xmath4 ) are directly related to thermal radiation of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp )  @xcite .",
    "however , contributions from other sources have to be measured experimentally .",
    "such contributions include background pairs from correlated open heavy flavor decays , which produce a pair of electrons or muons from the semileptonic decay of a pair of open charm or bottom hadrons ( @xmath9 or @xmath10 ) .",
    "anisotropic flow , an anisotropy in the particle production relative to the reaction plane , leads to correlations among particles  @xcite . the elliptic flow @xmath11 is the second harmonic of the azimuthal distribution of particles with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "@xmath11 has been measured for direct photons and found to be substantial in the transverse momentum range @xmath12 gev/@xmath13 in central 0 - 20% au+au collisions at @xmath1 gev  @xcite . in the same @xmath14 region ,",
    "phenix measured direct photon yields and found an excess of direct photon yield in 0 - 20% au+au over @xmath0 , exponential in @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "model calculations  @xcite for qgp thermal photons in this kinematic region significantly under - predict the observed @xmath11 while if a significant contribution from the hadronic sources at later stages is added , the excess of the spectra and the observed @xmath11 at @xmath12 gev/@xmath13 are described reasonably well  @xcite . it has been proposed that di - lepton @xmath11 measurements will provide another independent way to study medium properties since di - leptons provide two independent kinematic parameters : mass and @xmath14 .",
    "specifically , @xmath11 as a function of @xmath14 in different mass regions will enable us to probe the properties of medium from a hadron - gas dominated to a qgp dominated scenario  @xcite",
    ".    at star , the newly installed time - of - flight detector ( tof ) offers large acceptance and high efficiency  @xcite .",
    "the tof , combined with measurements of ionization energy loss ( de / dx ) from the time projection chamber ( tpc )  @xcite , enables electron identification with high purity for @xmath15 gev/@xmath13  @xcite . in this article",
    "we present the di - electron mass spectra in @xmath0 and au+au collisions at @xmath1 gev .",
    "the elliptic flow @xmath11 measurements are also reported in 200 gev au+au collisions .",
    "future capabilities for di - lepton measurements at star in lower energy au+au collisions and with detector upgrades are discussed .",
    "we utilize 107 million , 270 million and 150 million events for @xmath0 , minimum - bias ( 0 - 80% ) au+au , and central ( 0 - 10% ) au+au di - electron analyses , respectively .",
    "the @xmath0 events were taken in 2009 when 72% of the full tof system was installed and operational , while the au+au events were taken in 2010 with full tof system coverage . by applying velocity and de / dx cuts on tracks with @xmath16 gev/@xmath13",
    ", we can achieve the purity for the electron candidates of about 99% in @xmath0 collisions and 97% in minimum - bias au+au collisions .",
    "the di - electron signals may come from light and heavy flavor hadron decays .",
    "they include @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 dalitz decays : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 ; vector meson decays : @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 ; heavy - flavor hadron semi - leptonic decays : @xmath29 and @xmath30 ; and drell - yan contributions . in au+au collisions , we look for additional vector meson in - medium modifications in the low mass region and possible qgp thermal radiations in the intermediate mass range .",
    "the @xmath31 and @xmath32 pairs from the same events are combined to reconstruct the invariant mass distributions ( @xmath33 ) marked as unlike - sign distributions .",
    "the unlike - sign distributions contain both signal and background .",
