    "theoretical predictions of the continuum theory of the nematic liquid crystals ( lc ) were successfully confirmed in many experimental observations @xcite .",
    "one of the most studied effect is the influence of an external field on the orientational distribution of the lc director field @xmath4 .",
    "the physics involved in a competition between the mechanical and field forces that can be developed in lc media , calls for careful analysis .",
    "well known example is the freedericksz effect @xcite , observed when nematic lc cell with initial uniform distribution of @xmath5 is subjected to an external magnetic field . in many cases ,",
    "the stabilizing elastic forces compete with the destabilizing magnetic field giving rise to a critical phenomenon .",
    "however , the critical phenomena in lc can be sustained even if both the elastic and magnetic fields are defined as stabilizing .",
    "such critical phenomena exist due to the effect of surface tension which tends to minimize the surface area by distorting the initial shape of the system .",
    "the nematicity of lc s , being a source for elastic properties , results in enhancement of stability of lc jets @xcite , as compared to ordinary liquids .",
    "a similar stability enhancement appears in ordinary liquid jets with isotropic magnetic permeability ( see @xcite and @xcite ) when they are subjected to an external magnetic field . unlike the elasticity",
    ", the external field has a critical value beyond which instability of the jet is completely suppressed for all disturbance wavelengths @xcite .",
    "nematic lc s are usually _ anisotropic diamagnetics _ with positive anisotropy @xmath0 of the magnetic susceptibility @xcite .",
    "this poses an additional challenge with respect to the above mentioned phenomena .",
    "it is reflected by the extra terms in the lc hydrodynamics due to orientational interaction between the magnetic field @xmath6 and lc director @xmath7 .    the static version of capillary instability in liquid jets is known as the plateau instability in the liquid cylinders @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it dates back to the classical works of j. plateau @xcite who defined the problem of finding a surface of liquid with a minimal area @xmath8 given its boundary @xmath9 at fixed volume .",
    "the problem relates to the principle of minimum free energy at equilibrium .",
    "further generalization is called for if the excess free energy @xmath10 , of the cylinder , comprises different types of energy that reflect a more complex structure of the liquid ( e.g. elasticity @xcite _ etc _ ) , as well as its capacity to interact with external fields .",
    "the purpose of this work is to extend the theory of plateau instability in lc cylinders @xcite so as to include the effect of static magnetic fields . here",
    "the motivation is both experimental and theoretical .",
    "experimentally , the question is how to set the initial orientation of director * n * collinear with the lc cylinder axis .",
    "a weak magnetic field can serve to this end .",
    "theoretically , the framework outlined in @xcite can be extended so as to incorporate the influence of external fields on the evolution and stability of the lc cylinder . in particular , the plateau instability is studied with respect to the effect of the magnetic anisotropy of the lc cylinder .",
    "consider _ an isothermal incompressible lc cylinder in a uniform magnetic field _ @xmath11 that is applied in free space along the cylinder axis .",
    "we assume a rigid boundary condition ( bc ) where the director is tangentially anchored at the free surface of the lc cylinder .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility tensor @xmath12 of the lc is assumed anisotropic , symmetric , and independent of the magnetic field . in the reference frame related to the cylinder axis its diagonal terms are @xmath13 while its off  diagonal term is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 are the axial and radial components of director * n * , respectively .",
    "when the lc cylinder ( assumed long compared to its diameter ) is undisturbed the total free energy @xmath16 of the system is defined by @xmath17 where the integral represents the volume @xmath18 of the undisturbed cylinder which is enclosed by the surface @xmath19 .",
    "the term @xmath20 stands for the surface free energy of the undisturbed cylinder , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote its radius , length and surface tension respectively , and @xmath23 is permeability of a free space .",
    "we specify the commonly used harmonic deformation of the cylinder as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 , @xmath26 being the disturbance wavelength .",
    "let the extent of deformation be characterized by a length @xmath27 , such that @xmath28 .",
    "deformation of the cylinder shape changes the magnetic field @xmath29 over all space @xmath30 , while the director field @xmath5 is changed only within the internal domain @xmath31 .",
    "following plateau , we assume conservation of the cylinder volume @xmath32 the total free energy @xmath33 of the disturbed cylinder takes the following form , @xmath34 the first term in ( [ distrib0 ] ) , which stands for the interfacial energy of the disturbed cylinder , is classically known due to plateau @xcite @xmath35 the second term in ( [ distrib0 ] ) is due to the elastic deformation of the director field @xmath5 , and in the single elastic approximation is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the elastic modulus . the last two terms in ( [ distrib0 ] ) correspond to the effect of the magnetic fields in the internal @xmath31 and external @xmath38 domains @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the internal and external magnetic fields , respectively .",
    "if the deviations of the director @xmath42 from its initial orientation @xmath43 along the @xmath44 direction are small , then @xmath45 the magnetic energy density in the second term of @xmath46 ( scaled by @xmath47 ) reads @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the lc relative permeability tensor : @xmath50 .",
    "the excess free energy @xmath10 of the system is defined as , @xmath51 from the mathematical standpoint , the variational problem for minimization of @xmath10 , supplemented with constraint ( [ stat2a ] ) for all smooth surfaces @xmath52 , is known as the isoperimetric problem .",
    "the cylinder instability can be studied assuming small perturbation in its shape . in this case",
    "the plateau problem becomes solvable in closed form .",
    "the fields @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which must satisfy maxwell equations , can be presented as small perturbations of @xmath11 , @xmath55 where according to the assumption @xmath56 the following approximations apply @xmath57 the dimensionless fields @xmath58 are dependent on the coordinates as indicated by virtue of translational invariance of the problem @xmath59 we set @xmath60 and evaluate the free energy per unit wave length . substituting ( [ stat1 ] ) , ( [ distrib11])([distrib1 ] ) and ( [ stat7 ] ) into ( [ stat5 ] ) we obtain in the @xmath61approximation @xmath62 where the magnetic part was calculated in appendix [ appendix1 ] @xmath63",
    "the magnetostatics of the disturbed lc cylinder is governed by maxwell equations for the internal @xmath64 and external @xmath54 magnetic fields and the euler  lagrange equation apply for the director field @xmath5 , @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 denote internal and external magnetic inductions , respectively @xmath68 equations ( [ max1 ] ) , ( [ max1a ] ) must be supplemented with boundary conditions ( bc ) at the interface @xmath69 , @xmath70 where * t * and * e * stand for tangential and normal unit vectors to the surface , respectively .",
    "since the surface deformation is small , linearization can be applied , @xmath71 a standard way to solve the problem is to introduce a director potential @xmath72 and two magnetic potentials @xmath73 and @xmath74 as follows latexmath:[\\ ] ] it is quite surprising that among all above integrals there is only one ( [ integ1c ] ) which dominates over the others in the region @xmath168 .",
    "thus , in this limit we finally have @xmath169 the last expression shows that the anisotropic part of @xmath170 can prevail over the isotropic one provided that , @xmath171",
    "the non  homogeneous equation @xmath172 leads to the non  homogeneous equation for the amplitude function @xmath173 @xmath174 or , after substitution @xmath175 , essentially simplifies the problem @xmath176 its solution reads @xmath177 and finally @xmath178"
