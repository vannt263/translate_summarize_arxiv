    "when investigating the equilibrium properties of a complex polyatomic system , it is customary to identify a suitable _ reaction coordinate _ @xmath2 that maps atomic positions @xmath3 onto the points of some manifold @xmath4 , and then to study its equilibrium probability density : @xmath5\\big>,\\ ;    \\xi\\in\\mathbb{q}\\ ] ] ( angular brackets denote an ensemble average ) .",
    "the density @xmath6 provides information about the relative stability of states corresponding to different values of @xmath7 along with useful insights into the transitional kinetics between various stable states . in practice , the landau free energy@xcite @xmath8 is typically preferred over @xmath6 , because it tends to be more intuitive .",
    "either @xmath6 or @xmath9 is said to provide a coarse - grained description of the system  in terms of @xmath7 alone  with the rest of the degrees of freedom of the original system integrated out .",
    "quite naturally , the reaction coordinate ( often also referred to as _ collective variable _ or _ order parameter _ ) is typically chosen to represent the slowest degrees of freedom of the original system , although this is not formally required .    in the past few years",
    ", several methods targeting the computation of @xmath9 using non - equilibrium dynamics have become popular .",
    "first methods that introduced a time evolving potential to bias the original potential energy were the the ` l`ocal ` e`levation ` m`ethod ( ` lem`)@xcite , by huber , torda and van gunsteren in the ` md ` context and the wang - landau approach in ` mc ` one@xcite .",
    "more recent approaches include the adaptive - force bias method@xcite , and the non - equilibrium metadynamics@xcite method .",
    "these methods all estimate the free energy of the reaction coordinate from an `` evolving '' ensemble of realizations@xcite , and use that estimate to bias the system dynamics , so as to flatten the effective free energy surface .",
    "collectively , they can all be considered as umbrella sampling methods , with an evolving potential . in the long time",
    "limit , the biasing force is expected to compensate for the free energy gradient , so that the biasing potential eventually reproduces the free energy surface .    in this work",
    ", we present an ` a`daptively ` b`iased ` m`olecular ` d`ynamics ( ` abmd ` ) method whose implementation is particularly efficient and suited for free energy calculations .",
    "the method has an @xmath0 scaling with molecular dynamics time t and is characterized by only two control parameters .",
    "in addition , the method allows for extensions based on _",
    "multiple walkers _ and _ replica exchange _ for both temperature and/or the collective variables .",
    "the ` abmd ` method has been implemented in the ` amber ` software package@xcite , and is to be distributed freely .    before discussing ` abmd ` , it is helpful to review the salient features of the metadynamics ( ` mtd ` ) method .",
    "essentially , the ` mtd ` method is built upon the ` lem ` method by exploiting car - parrinello dynamics : the phase space of the system is extended to include additional dynamical degrees of freedom harmonically coupled to the collective variable .",
    "these additional degrees of freedom are assumed to have masses associated with them , and evolve in time according to newton s laws .",
    "the masses are supposed to be large enough , so that the dynamics of these extra - variables is driven by the free energy gradient .",
    "their trajectory is then used to construct a history - dependent biasing potential by means of placing many small gaussians along the trajectory . when combined with car - parrinello _",
    "ab - initio _ dynamics , ` mtd ` has been successfully used to explore complex reaction pathways involving several energy barriers .    while ` mtd ` continues to be used successfully ,",
    "there are several known limitations associated with the initial implementation of the method , which provided the motivation for the development of the ` abmd ` method .",
    "first , in order to calculate reliable free energies with a _ controllable accuracy _ , long runs are needed , especially for the `` corrective '' follow - up at equilibrium@xcite .",
    "this is especially true for biomolecular systems , which typically are characterized by many degrees of freedom and non - negligible entropy contributions to the free energies .",
    "long runs , however , may be precluded by the ` mtd ` method , because of its unfavorable scaling with molecular dynamics ` md ` time @xmath1 . while one can readily speed up the original ` mtd ` method using such tricks as truncated gaussians and kd - trees@xcite , the bottleneck there is the explicit calculation of the history - dependent potential .",
    "since at every ` md ` step , gaussians from all previous time steps need to be added , the number of gaussians grows linearly with @xmath1 .",
    "the numerical cost of ` mtd ` therefore grows as @xmath10 which , in some cases , may prove itself to be prohibitively expensive , especially when long runs are needed .",
    "another undesirable feature is that the ` mtd ` method ( at least in its original implementation ) is characterized by a relatively large number of parameters ( _ e.g. _ , the masses and spring constants associated with the collective variable , the characteristics of the gaussians to be added , multiple control parameters , etc ) , all of which influence the dynamics in an entangled and non - transparent way .",
    "a successful ` mtd ` run often requires a careful balancing of these parameters , which is especially nontrivial for multidimensional collective variables .",
    "more recent implementations of ` mtd `  @xcite have reduced the number of parameters . as will be discussed , the ` abmd ` method is characterized by only _ two _ control parameters and scales as @xmath0 with simulation time .",
    "the ` abmd ` method is formulated in terms of the following set of equations : @xmath11,\\ ] ] @xmath12,\\ ] ] where the first set represents newton s equations that govern ordinary ` md ` ( temperature and pressure regulation terms are not shown ) augmented with the additional force coming from the time - dependent biasing potential @xmath13 ( with @xmath14 ) , whose time evolution is given by the second equation . in the following , we refer to @xmath15 as _ flooding timescale _ and to @xmath16 as _ kernel _ ( in analogy to the _ kernel density estimator _ widely used in statistics@xcite ) .",
    "the kernel is supposed to be positive definite ( @xmath17 ) and symmetric ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "it can be perceived as a smoothed dirac delta function . for large enough @xmath15 and small enough width of the kernel",
    ", the biasing potential @xmath13 converges towards @xmath19 as @xmath20@xcite .",
    "our numerical implementation of the ` abmd ` method involves the following .",
    "we stick with @xmath21 where @xmath22 is either @xmath23\\in\\mathbb{r}^1 $ ] or a one - dimensional torus , and use cubic b - splines ( or products of thereof for @xmath24 ) to discretize @xmath13 in @xmath4 : @xmath25 @xmath26 we use the biweight kernel@xcite for @xmath16 : @xmath27 and an euler - like discretization scheme for the time evolution of the biasing potential : @xmath28,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is at time @xmath1 .",
    "note that this time discretization may be readily improved .",
    "this , however , is not really important here , since the goal is not to recover the solution of the ` abmd ` equations _ per se _ , but rather to flatten @xmath30 in the @xmath20 limit .",
    "note also , that the numerical cost of evaluation of the time - dependent potential is constant over time , and so ` abmd ` scales trivially as @xmath0 , which is computationally quite favorable .",
    "the storage requirements of the ` abmd ` are also quite reasonable , especially if sparse arrays are used for @xmath31 . in addition , it is characterized by only _ two _ control parameters : the flooding timescale @xmath15 and the kernel width @xmath32 .    `",
    "abmd ` admits two important extensions .",
    "the first is identical in spirit to the _ _ multiple walkers metadynamics__@xcite .",
    "it amounts to carrying out several different ` md ` simulations biased by the same @xmath13 , which evolves via : @xmath33\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath34 labels different ` md ` trajectories .",
    "a second extension is to gather several different ` md ` trajectories , each bearing its own biasing potential and , if desired , its own distinct collective variable , into a generalized ensemble for `` replica exchange '' with modified `` exchange '' rules@xcite .",
    "both extensions are advantageous and lead to a more uniform flattening of @xmath30 in @xmath4 .",
    "this enhanced convergence to @xmath9 is due to the improved sampling of the `` evolving '' canonical distribution .",
    "the peptide in a @xmath35-hairpin conformation ( sketch ) . ]    we have implemented the ` abmd ` method in the ` amber ` package@xcite , with support for both replica exchange and multiple - walkers . in pure `` parallel tempering '' replica exchange ( same collective variable in all replicas )",
    ", @xmath36 replicas are simulated at different temperatures @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "each replica has its own biasing potential @xmath39 , @xmath38 , that evolves according to its dynamical equation .",
    "exchanges between neighboring replicas are attempted at a prescribed rate , with an exchange probability given by@xcite : @xmath40 @xmath41\\\\      \\nonumber      & - & \\frac{1}{k_bt_n}\\big[u^n(\\xi^n ) - u^n(\\xi^m)\\big],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 denotes the atomic potential energy .",
    "the biasing potentials are temperature - bound and converge in the @xmath20 limit to the free energies at their respective temperatures .",
    "we have also implemented a more _ general _ replica exchange scheme , where different replicas can have different collective variables and/or temperatures , and can experience either an evolving or a static biasing potential ( the latter obviously includes the case of @xmath43 ) .",
    "exchanges between random pairs of replicas are then tried at a prescribed rate .",
    "this method is simply a generalization  @xcite of the `` hamiltonian replica exchange '' method described in ref . , and reduces to it when all biasing potentials are static .",
    "the big advantage here is that , by using replicas with different collective variables , it is possible to obtain several _",
    "one- _ or _",
    "_ two-__dimensional projections of the free energy surface for the corresponding variables .",
    "this is very useful because it not only increases the amount of information that can be gathered from a given simulation , but it also allows for previously obtained information for a collective variable to be used to compute the free energy associated with different variables . for instance , suppose that in the course of a simulation it becomes apparent that one wishes to address additional questions involving different collective variables . instead of starting from `` scratch '' , one can re - use the already obtained biasing potentials and thereby greatly accelerate the free energy calculation for the new variables .",
    "it is also worth noting that for replicas running at the same temperature , the exchange probability does not depend on the atomic potential energies ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : exchange1])-([eq : exchange2 ] ) above ) .",
    "this implies that the number of replicas needed to maintain acceptable exchange rates can be made independent of the solvent degrees of freedom , provided that one is interested in the properties of the solute only ( so that the collective variables do not depend explicitly on the atomic coordinates of the solvent ) and that the structure is adequately solvated .",
    "this can be exploited to sample a solute with a minimum amount of solvent , and to accelerate the averaging over the solvent degrees of freedom .",
    "these last two applications of the _ general _ replica exchange method are illustrated in the next section .",
    "rms error of the free energy over @xmath44 at @xmath45 for the ` abmd ` ( blue ) and reference ` mtd ` ( red ) simulations . ]",
    "to illustrate the method , we have simulated the hydrophobic peptide ( sketched in fig.[fig:1 ] ) in the gas phase and in a solvated environment , using cyclohexane as the explicit solvent .",
    "the free energy of this peptide at @xmath46 in gas phase has previously been investigated with the ` mtd ` method@xcite , and is characterized by a `` double - well '' structure ( see fig.[fig:8 ] ) , with the wells corresponding to the peptide in a `` globular '' ( left minimum in the fig.[fig:8 ] ) and a @xmath35-hairpin ( right minimum in the fig.[fig:8 ] ) folded conformation , respectively . while simple enough , the molecule possesses all the typical features of larger peptide systems usually studied with biomolecular simulations .",
    "simulation parameters are as in a previous study@xcite : the atoms are described by the 1999 version of the cornell _ et al .",
    "_ force field@xcite , with no cutoff for the non - bonded interactions .",
    "the berendsen thermostat is chosen with @xmath47 for temperature control .",
    "the ` md ` time step ( @xmath48 ) is 1 fs for the parallel tempering simulations , and 2 fs otherwise .",
    "rms error of the free energy over @xmath44 for ` abmd ` simulations at @xmath45 with @xmath49 ( 1 ) , @xmath50 ( 2 ) , @xmath51 ( 3 ) and @xmath52 ( 4 ) . ]",
    "the radius of gyration of the heavy atoms was chosen to be the collective variable : @xmath53 here , @xmath54 is the center of mass , with @xmath55 , and the sum runs over all atoms except hydrogen .",
    "the initial configuration is the fully unfolded peptide . a reference free energy profile , whose error@xcite in the region of interest is less than 0.15 kcal / mol , was computed for benchmarking purposes ( see appendix  [ ap : reference ] for details ) . as a measure of the rms free energy error ,",
    "the following construction was used : @xmath56 where @xmath57 accounts for the arbitrary additive constants in the free energies @xmath58 . here",
    "@xmath59 and @xmath60 , which correspond to the physical region of interest ( see fig.[fig:8 ] ) .",
    "rms error of the free energy over 3.3@xmath616.3 for multiple walkers ` abmd ` simulations with @xmath62 using one ( 1 ) , two ( 2 ) , four ( 4 ) and eight ( 8) trajectories at @xmath63k . ]",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] presents the time dependence of the rms free energy error for the ` abmd ` and reference ` mtd ` run@xcite .",
    "both simulations have exactly the same kernel width @xmath64 , and flooding timescale @xmath65 that corresponds to the _ a posteriori _ hills acceptance rate reported in ref .. it is evident that the ` ambd ` run is more accurate than the corresponding ` mtd ` run .",
    "the ` abmd ` method owes its better convergence to the smoother time evolution of the biasing potential and accurate discretization in @xmath4 .",
    "the amount of memory used by the ` abmd ` simulation to store @xmath31 values was only @xmath66 bytes ( considering double precision ) for roughly @xmath67 tiny `` hills '' that were accumulated by the end of the run .",
    "the reference ` mtd ` simulation with merely @xmath68 gaussians required roughly 25 times more memory for the biasing potential ( with only the positions of the gaussians stored explicitly ) .",
    "one can expect , that ` abmd ` will be even more economical when it comes to dealing with multidimensional collective variables , provided that sparse arrays are used for @xmath31 with only non - zero elements being stored explicitly .",
    "although an _ a priori _ error estimate for this type of non - equilibrium simulation is really not feasible , it is expected that the error should decrease for increased @xmath15 .",
    "this point is illustrated in fig.[fig:3 ] , which shows the error for increasing values of @xmath15 .    in order to decrease the simulation time required for accurate free energy estimates",
    "even further , the multiple - walker variation of ` abmd ` proves to be useful . for a moderate number of walkers ,",
    "the speedup is nearly linear , with an additional increase in accuracy coming from the better sampling of the `` evolving '' canonical distribution ( see fig.[fig:4 ] ) .",
    "parallel tempering improves both the speed and the accuracy even more . to this end",
    ", we first ran ` abmd ` with @xmath69 using 2 , 4 , 6 and 8 replicas at @xmath46 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( during equilibrium ` md ` runs , the peptide configuration jumps between the two minima on a picosecond timescale at @xmath77 ) . in all cases ,",
    "the @xmath78 was found to be @xmath79 kcal / mol , or less as @xmath20 ( data not shown ) .",
    "again , the improvement in accuracy stems from the better sampling of the `` evolving '' canonical distribution .",
    "then , we ran 8 replicas with smaller values @xmath15 and were surprised that the accuracy does not degrade , even for @xmath80 as shown in fig.[fig:5 ] .",
    "rms error of the free energy over @xmath44 at @xmath45 for parallel tempering ` abmd ` simulations using eight replicas running at @xmath46 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 with @xmath69 ( 1 ) , @xmath81 ( 2 ) , @xmath82 ( 3 ) and @xmath83 ( 4 ) . ]",
    "finally , we turn to aspects related to the _ general _ replica exchange method and illustrate its potential . as already noted , by using replicas with different collective variables and swapping these at prescribed rates , it is possible to obtain projections of the free energy surface for the corresponding variables .",
    "it is also possible to use previously obtained information with respect to one collective variable to compute the free energy associated with a different variable .",
    "for example , suppose that instead of the _ one - dimensional _ free energy profile as as a function of @xmath84 already discussed , one realizes that what is actually needed is a _ two - dimensional _ profile that includes information with respect to the number of o - h bonds along the backbone .",
    "the two - dimensional free energy map is computationally quite expensive , but the calculation can be greatly accelerated with the help of the general replica exchange method",
    ". we therefore simulated @xmath85 replicas .",
    "the eight replicas were run at the previously stated temperatures , with each replica biased by a _ static _ ( not evolving ) biasing potential corresponding to the negated free energy associated with the radius of gyration @xmath84 at the corresponding temperature , as shown in fig.[fig:8 ]",
    ". the additional ninth replica was run at @xmath46 with ` abmd ` flooding in the two collective variables , _",
    "@xmath84 and the number of o - h bonds along the backbone as given by @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the distance between a pair of hydrogen and oxygen atoms and @xmath88 .",
    "the sum runs over the unique o - h pairs ( _ i.e. _ , each o - h pair is counted only once ) , with o and h separated by one or more amino - bases along the backbone ( 27 pairs in total ) . in other words",
    ", we `` re - use '' the previously computed free energies for @xmath84 to get the free energy in the two - dimensional space @xmath89 : the eight first replicas serve as a `` sampling enhancement device '' for the ninth replica .",
    "the calculation is carried out in two stages : a `` coarse '' stage ( @xmath90 with @xmath91 and @xmath92 , @xmath93 ) followed by a `` fine '' stage ( @xmath94 with @xmath95 and @xmath96 , @xmath97 ) . in both runs exchanges between four randomly chosen pairs of replicas",
    "were attempted every @xmath98 .",
    "the final free energy map is shown in fig.[fig:6 ] .",
    "it is clear that this two - dimensional free energy landscape conveys additional information not contained in the one - dimensional free energy plots already discussed . in particular",
    ", it allows for a better characterization of the `` globular '' states of the : specifically , it is apparent from the fig.[fig:6 ] that there are at least two such states with different values of @xmath99 ( both correspond to the left minimum in fig.[fig:8 ] ) .",
    "of course , one could have re - used the information in the one - dimensional @xmath84 profiles to include other collective variables , in addition to @xmath99 .",
    "free energy map for peptide in the gas phase as a function of the collective variables @xmath84 and @xmath99 .",
    "( see ref . for details regarding the algorithm used to make this plot ) . ]",
    "the general replica exchange ` abmd ` may also be advantageous for explicit solvent simulations , which are often notoriously lengthy . specifically , if one is interested in the solute and the collective variables",
    "do not depend on the solvent degrees of freedom , then the number of replicas required to maintain an adequate exchange rate depends only very weakly on the amount of solvent ( which must of course be sufficient as to adequately solvate the structure ) , provided that all the replicas are simulated at the same temperature .",
    "this is because the exchange probability does not explicitly depend on the potential energy difference when the temperature of the replicas is the same . while not every choice of collective variables for different replicas will lead to decent exchange rates , one can nevertheless take advantage of this property and use general replica exchange to enhance the sampling in a solvated environment .    in order to demonstrate the method in this regime",
    ", we simulated the peptide at @xmath46 solvated by 171 cyclohexane ( @xmath100 ) molecules ( the total number of atoms was 3139 ) under periodic boundary conditions using the general@xcite ` amber ` force - field ( ` gaff ` ) for the solvent .",
    "we used a _ truncated octahedron _ cell of fixed size ( constant volume ) that corresponds to the equilibrium density at @xmath46 ( the equilibrium density value was obtained from a @xmath101 simulation under constant pressure at @xmath46 ) .",
    "the particle - mesh ewald ( ` pme`@xcite ) method was used for the electrostatic forces , with a @xmath102 ` fft ` grid and an @xmath103 cutoff for the direct sum ( same cutoff was used for van der waals interactions ) .",
    "first , we ran 10 replicas in the `` flooding '' mode ( _ i.e. _ , under evolving biasing potentials ) using as collective variables the distances @xmath104 between the backbone carbons separated by at least 2 amino - acids ( there are 10 such distances for ) .",
    "we ran for @xmath105 with @xmath106 and @xmath107 , and then for another @xmath105 with @xmath108 and @xmath109 , attempting exchanges between five randomly selected pairs every @xmath110 . as expected , at the start of the simulation , the exchange rate was nearly 100% decreasing later as the biasing potentials were built up . by the end of the simulation , when all possible values of the distances had been covered , the exchange rate was very disparate between different pairs of replicas . however , for every replica there was at least one other replica such that the exchange rate between them was reasonable ( _ i.e. , _ the whole simulation did not degenerate into ten different non - interacting trajectories ) .",
    "we then set @xmath111 in these 10 replicas , and added an eleventh replica whose collective variable was chosen as the radius of gyration of the heavy atoms .",
    "in other words , as before , we use the ten replicas as a `` sampling enhancement device '' for the last one .",
    "we then ran a two - stage flooding scheme : a @xmath105 coarser stage , with @xmath112 and @xmath92 ; followed by a @xmath101 finer stage , with @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "as before , the exchange attempts between 5 randomly selected pairs of replicas were performed every @xmath110 .",
    "the `` raw '' ` abmd`-computed free energy associated with @xmath84 after that stage is shown in fig.[fig:7 ] . in a next step",
    ", we ran 64 biased simulations ( each comprising of 11 replicas ) for @xmath115 ( first @xmath116 for equilibration followed by @xmath105 of `` production '' runs ) starting from different initial configurations .",
    "we set @xmath111 in all replicas ( static biasing potentials ) and recorded the values of @xmath84 in the eleventh replica every 10 picoseconds .",
    "we then used the log - spline algorithm of stone@xcite _ at .",
    "_ to estimate the ( biased ) log - density of the @xmath84 values at _",
    "equilibrium_. this led us to the final shape of the free energy curve shown in fig.[fig:7 ] .",
    "compared to the gas phase , the folded @xmath35-turn in the cyclohexane solvated peptide is clearly favored over the globular structure .    free energy for peptide solvated in cyclohexane at @xmath46 as obtained via : coarse ( non - equilibrium ) replica - exchange ` abmd ` ( 1 ) ; finer ( non - equilibrium ) replica - exchange ` abmd ` ( 2 ) ; including the correction coming from equilibrium biased replica exchange ( 3 ) . ]",
    "in summary , we have presented an ` abmd ` method that computes the free energy surface of a reaction coordinate using non - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "the method belongs to the general category of umbrella sampling methods with an evolving potential , and is characterized by only two control parameters ( the flooding timescale and the kernel width ) and a favorable @xmath0 scaling with molecular dynamics time t. this scaling can be very important for large - scale classical ` md ` biomolecular simulations when long simulation times are required ( see , for example ref . , and references therein ) .",
    "` abmd ` has also been extended to support multiple walkers and replica exchange .",
    "both variations improve speed and accuracy of the method due to the better sampling of the `` evolving '' canonical distribution .",
    "the replica exchange ` abmd ` has been generalized to include different temperatures and/or collective variables , that move under either an evolving or a static biasing potential . aside from enhancing the sampling , this swapping of replicas has several important practical advantages .",
    "most importantly , it enables one to obtain projections of the free energy surface for _ any number of collective variables _ one might wish to investigate .",
    "in addition , one can re - use previously obtained results in order to enhance the sampling of new collective variables .",
    "it is also possible to exploit the fact that exchange rates at the same temperature are independent of the potential energy to enhance sampling of a solute in a minimum amount of solvent ( for collective variables independent of solvent atom coordinates ) .",
