    "population permanency in a patchy environment is the result of a complex interaction between spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability of the environment , dispersal , density - dependence and population structure .",

    "; see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    one way to theoretically approach",
    "the problem of population dynamics is by formulating mathematical models that incorporate internal and external factors of population growth .",
    "the literature on the population models with various level of complexity is quite vast and detailed review is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we mention only some of the well - established models that have been developed over the years . among the unstructured models , the malthus model of exponential growth and the verhulst logistic model are especially important . for the age - structured models with density - dependency or time - dependency we refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the common point for the age - structured models is that _ the net reproductive rate _ and _ the characteristic equation _",
    "are used to determine permanency of a population .",
    "the spatial structure has been recognized as one of the most important factors of growth . in this case , each individual s birth and death rate are dependent upon the habitat / patch where they are in the landscape . for simplicity ,",
    "let a population inhabit a discrete space which consists of several patches .",
    "a source is a high - quality patch that yields positive population growth , while a sink is a low - quality patch and it yields negative growth rate . in isolation , every subpopulation has its own dynamics .",
    "linking the patches by dispersal lead us to the source - sink dynamics , where all local subpopulations contribute to the unique global dynamics .",
    "for populations that inhabit several patches , possibility to move from one patch to another can be crucial for survival .",
    "for example , dispersal from a source to a sink can save the local sink subpopulation from extinction through the rescue effect and recolonization @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the influence of spatial heterogeneity in unstructured populations was studied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . the trade - off between competition and dispersal",
    "is investigated in @xcite and the relation between dispersal pattern and permanency was discussed in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the continuous age - structured models with spatial structure can be divided into classes . in the first type of models",
    "individuals occupy position in a spatial environment and spatial movement is typically controlled by diffusion or taxis processes @xcite . in the second class fits the models with several species or populations occupying different regions ( ` patches ' ) accompanying with migration between them .",
    "the usual practice here is to have only two classes ( immature and adults ) and dispersion between a few ( two or three ) temporally unchangeable patches , as in e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a rigorous mathematical derivation of the results considering the existence and uniqueness of a solution in a fairly general form in presence of migrations .",
    "inspired by the single - patch models we come to the fundamental questions :    * is it possible to define an analogue of the characteristic equation and the net reproductive rate for the several - patches model ?",
    "* if so , can they be used for the analysis of the large - time behavior of the solution and for establishing the condition for the population s permanency ?",
    "the main contribution of the paper is in the rigorous proof that the both questions have affirmative answers in the constant , periodic and the general time - dependent case .",
    "the method that we use for the time - dependent cases allows us to consider fluctuations that are not necessarily small in amplitude .",
    "besides , we use general results to discuss the real world problems , such as the survival of migrating species and pest control .    to set up the model",
    ", we follow the argument of @xcite and @xcite , and assume that a population is age - structured , density - dependent and inhabits @xmath0 temporally variable and different patches . a local subpopulation on each patch experiences intraspecific competition , which results in additional density - dependent mortality .",
    "let @xmath1 denote the age distribution in the population patch @xmath2 at time @xmath3 with the corresponding birth rate @xmath4 and the initial distribution of population @xmath5 .",
    "then the assumption that only the members of the age class are competing led to the following mckendrick - von foerster type balance equations @xcite : @xmath6 in the domain @xmath7 subject to the _ birth law _ @xmath8 and the _ initial age distribution _",
    "@xmath9 here @xmath10 denotes the _ maximal length of life _ of individuals in population at age @xmath11 , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the mortality rate of the population patch @xmath2 , and the the dispersion matrix @xmath14 describes the migration rates between patches : the coefficients @xmath15 define a proportion of individuals of age @xmath16 at age @xmath3 on patch @xmath17 that migrates to patch @xmath2 . then @xmath18 is the total population at time @xmath3 .",
    "the predecessor of the present model in the single patch case @xmath19 is the model proposed by von foerster @xcite ; a detailed analysis was given by gurtin and maccamy @xcite and chipot @xcite , @xcite . a comprehensive treatment of this approach is given by iannelli @xcite .",
    "prss @xcite , @xcite was the first to study a mathematical model of an @xmath0-species population with age - specific interactions in absence of migration . by using the theory of semilinear evolution equations he established the well - posedness and the existence of an equilibrium solution under certain constraints on the birth and death rates .",
    "he also derived some ( local or asymptotic ) stability results for for the equilibrium solutions .",
    "when @xmath20 , migration between patches is absent , and the system splits into @xmath0 independent balance equations .",
    "this model under an additional assumption that @xmath21 is the logistic regulatory function has recently been studied in @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath22 is much more challenging . in modeling the source - sink dynamics ,",
    "fundamentally important is the fact that individuals can disperse and move from one patch to another .",
    "migration , which in the biological terms means a round - trip from a birthplace , is particularly significant .",
    "then it is natural to expect that the global and asymptotic behaviour of solutions to  is determined by both the sign pattern and the weighted graph associated with @xmath23 .",

    "let us recall some relevant concepts . given a metzler matrix @xmath79 , one can associate a directed graph @xmath80 with nodes labeled by @xmath81 where an arc leads from @xmath82 to @xmath17 , @xmath83 , if and only if @xmath84 . the patch @xmath17 is said to be reachable from @xmath82 , denoted @xmath85 , if there exists a directed path from @xmath82 to @xmath17 . a digraph is called _ connected from vertex _",

    "@xmath87 if the associated digraph @xmath88 is connected from @xmath2 for any @xmath77 .",
    "the accessibility condition relies on the sign pattern of the corresponding dispersion matrix and can be readily obtained by the standard tools of nonnegative matrix theory ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  3 ) .",
    "now , notice that by [ hain4 ] the following value is finite : @xmath89 from the biological point of view , @xmath90 is the _ maximal fertility age _ in population @xmath2 .",
    "our last condition reads as follows :    1 .",
    "[ hain6 ] for any @xmath91 there exists @xmath92 such that the patch @xmath2 is accessible at age @xmath93 .",
    "in other words , [ hain6 ] asserts that for any patch @xmath2 there is a moment @xmath94 such that a ( composite ) migration from any other patch @xmath17 to @xmath2 is possible _ within the reproductive period_. namely , some biological studies indicate that there are many different causes for dispersal , such as response to environmental conditions , prevention of inbreeding or competition for mates , see for instance @xcite .",
    "thus , one can think of differences with respect to life - history traits , genetics and demography between dispersers and residents .",
    "when it comes to demography , more often than not , dispersing females are young individuals in their reproductive age , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "very old individuals usually do not engage in breeding dispersal , which is the topic of our study .",
    "let us denote by @xmath95 the newborn function , i.e. a vector - function whose components denote the number of newborns on each patch .",
    "then , the problem ( [ genpr])([genic ] ) can be reduced to the integral equation @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are positive nondecreasing operators with bounded ranges and @xmath99 for large @xmath77 .",
    "our strategy for proving permanency results is as follows : we first establish the permanency results for time - independent and time - periodic coefficients , and then show that in the general situation , a solution of ( [ newb ] ) can be well - controlled by these cases .",
    "if the environment is constant then the model parameters are time - independent functions .",
    "then it is reasonable to assume that the maximal life - time is constant : @xmath100 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "our approach relies on a fine control of large - time behaviour of an arbitrary solution to ( [ newb ] ) by nontrivial solutions of the associated _ characteristic equation _ @xmath101 where the operator @xmath102 is given by the right hand side in ( [ genbc ] ) for a time - independent solution to ( [ genpr ] ) with a constant boundary condition @xmath103 .",
    "clearly , @xmath104 is a ( trivial ) solution of the characteristic equation .",
    "our goal is to establish when a nontrivial positive solution @xmath105 exists .",
    "a crucial tool here is the so - called _ maximal solution _ of the characteristic equation , i.e. a solution @xmath106 of such that for an arbitrary solution @xmath107 there holds @xmath108 . in particular",
    ", @xmath109 implies that the characteristic equation has only trivial solutions .",
    "we establish the existence of the maximal solution in section  [ sec : max ] .",
    "another important ingredient is the _ net reproductive operator _",
    "@xmath110 where @xmath111 is the unique solution of the linearized initial problem @xmath112 we show that under conditions [ hain1]-[hain6 ] , @xmath113 is a strongly positive operator . by perron ",
    "frobenius theorem , its spectral radius @xmath114 is equal to the largest positive eigenvalue .",
    "we call this value _ the net reproductive rate_.    to motivate the latter definition , observe that in the single - patch case , the net reproductive rate @xmath115 is given by @xmath116 it it related to the solution of the euler - lotka characteristic equations in the linear age - structured population model ; see @xcite . according to @xcite , @xmath115 is related to the solution @xmath117 of the characteristic equation in the nonlinear age - structured model .",
    "namely , if @xmath118 , then @xmath119 and the population is going to extinction , while for @xmath120 , we have @xmath121 and the population is permanent .",
    "the same is obviously valid if there are several patches without migration ( i.e. @xmath122 ) : every local subpopulation behaves accordingly to the value of @xmath115 on the respective patch .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is the following dichotomy result on the long - term dynamics of populations .",
    "[ tha ] if @xmath123 then @xmath124 and the characteristic equation has no nontrivial solutions .",
    "if @xmath125 then @xmath126 and @xmath127 is the only nontrivial solution of the characteristic equation .    if @xmath128 is an arbitrary solution of then    * if @xmath129 then @xmath130 and @xmath131 as @xmath132 , * if @xmath133 then @xmath134 and @xmath135 as @xmath132 , where @xmath136 is the solution of the initial problem @xmath137    thus , the net reproductive rate @xmath138 effectively determines large time behavior of population on @xmath0 patches in a constant environment",
    "as in the single - patch case , @xmath129 implies extinction of a population on all patches , while @xmath133 grants the global permanency of a population .",
    "we see that the dichotomy result for a multi - patch population is completely consistent with the single - patch case when the net reproductive operator @xmath139 coincides with the multiplication by @xmath115 ( thus implying @xmath140 ) .",
    "it is also important to emphasize that the function @xmath136 in is exactly the unique equilibrium point of the problem , provided that @xmath106 satisfies the characteristic equation . in other words ,",
    "theorem  [ tha ] implies the global stability result : any solution of the principal model converges at infinity to the unique equilibrium point given by the characteristic equation .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ tha ] , along with certain related results , occupies section  [ sec : const ] and make an essential use of the auxiliary monotonicity results collected in section  [ sec : prel ] and functional theoretic properties of the integral equation given in section  [ sec : general ] .",
    "our approach relies on the following steps and can be described as follows .",
    "first we associate to an arbitrary solution @xmath141 of ( [ newb ] ) certain lower and upper monotone sequences .",
    "the existence of an upper sequence relies on the boundedness of the image of @xmath97 .",
    "the construction of a lower sequence is more tricky and involves certain fine properties of the maximal solution and some previous auxiliary monotonicity results accompanying by the accessibility condition [ hain6 ] .",
    "the main problem here is to control a nonzero asymptotic behaviour of the lower approximants as @xmath142 .",
    "next , we show that the large - time behaviour of @xmath141 can be well controlled by the limits at infinity constructed monotone approximants .",
    "furthermore , we are able to identify the common limits as the maximal solution @xmath106 .",
    "this finally establishes that the constructed sequences converge to the equilibrium point of the original problem .",
    "notice that the monotonicity of the lower and upper approximations is crucial because the convergence established in the first steps is valid only on any bounded interval .",
    "a life - history trade - off between reproduction and migration has been noted for many species , including migratory birds and some insects ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this trade - off is caused by energy constraints because both reproduction and migration are energetically costly for organisms .",
    "keeping the assumption that the environment is constant and using the specific form of the balance system , we investigate the consequences of this trade - off .",
    "the fact that individuals do not reproduce during migration is biologically justified and mathematically it is stated as : @xmath143 the relation between dispersion coefficients means that some migrants that are leaving patch @xmath17 will eventually die before reaching patch @xmath2 , but they will not give birth during migration . then , we establish in section [ sec : est ] the following two - side estimates for the net reproductive rate .    under additional assumption that holds we have @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the maximal birth rate and @xmath146",
    "is the minimal death rate on all patches .",
    "in addition , in proposition  [ pro : upper ] below we establish a priori estimates for the net reproductive rate and for the maximal solution @xmath106 .",
    "natural habitats are usually positively autocorrelated , see for example @xcite .",
    "therefore , the assumption that the vital rates , regulating function and dispersal coefficients are changing periodically with respect to time is a reasonable approximation . in the study of the large - time behavior of a solution to equation ( [ newb ] ) in a periodically changing environment",
    ", the pivotal role belongs to the characteristic equation @xmath147 where the operator @xmath148 is given by the right hand side of ( [ genbc ] ) and @xmath76 solves ( [ genpr ] ) with a periodic boundary condition @xmath149 , @xmath150 .",
    "we establish in section [ sec : periodic ] that the operator @xmath148 is absolutely continuous which allows us to extend the methods of section  [ sec : const ] to the periodic case .",
    "in particular , the corresponding net reproductive operator @xmath151 defined on space of periodic continuous functions is strictly positive and its spectral radius @xmath152 is equal to the largest eigenvalue .",
    "we are also able to establish the corresponding dichotomy result for a periodic environment .",
    "if the environment is changing irregularly , the structure parameters the principal model ( [ genpr])([genic ] ) can be estimated from above and below by nonnegative periodic functions .",
    "using these periodic functions as a structure parameters for new models , we formulate two associated periodic problems .",
    "one of them is the best - case scenario and its solution is an upper bound for the original problem .",
    "the other is the worst - case scenario and its solution is a lower bound . in other words , a solution for the general time - dependent problem",
    "can be bounded for large values of @xmath3 by above and below by the solution to the associated periodic problems , as stated in theorem [ main_gen ] .      using the source - sink dynamics it is possible to explain permanency of a population on several patches provided that at least one patch is a source and that all patches are connected by dispersion . in section [ sec : sink - source ] we assume that the environment is constant and consists of several patches .",
    "then it is possible to show that survival of population on both patches is possible provided that emigration from the source is sufficiently small .",
    "furthermore , in section [ sink - only ] , we show that permanency is possible even if all patches are sinks provided that dispersion is appropriately chosen .",
    "this is especially important for migratory birds , since both of their habitats can be seen as sinks ( one because of the low reproduction due to insufficient resources , and the other because of the high mortality in the winter ) .",
    "this example can be related to the results in @xcite , where a simple model is used for analysis of connection between population permanency and allocation of offspring in a population that lives on several patches .",
    "one of the results is that permanency is possible even if all patches are sinks .",
    "below we establish some auxiliary monotonicity results for lower and upper solutions to a general system of ordinary differential equations @xmath153 where @xmath154 is a locally lipschitz function in @xmath155 for any @xmath156 satisfying the _ kamke - mller condition _",

    "<S> we consider a system of nonlinear partial differential equations that describes an age - structured population inhabiting several temporally varying patches . </S>",
    "<S> we prove existence and uniqueness of solution and analyze its large - time behavior in cases when the environment is constant and when it changes periodically . </S>",
    "<S> a pivotal assumption is that individuals can disperse and that each patch can be reached from every other patch , directly or through several intermediary patches . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the net reproductive operator and characteristic equations for time - independent and periodical models and prove that permanency is defined by the net reproductive rate for the whole system . </S>",
    "<S> if the net reproductive rate is less or equal to one , extinction on all patches is imminent . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , permanency on all patches is guaranteed . </S>",
    "<S> the proof is based on a new approach to analysis of large - time stability .    </S>",
