    ", the spin - transistor proposal @xcite relies on subjecting injected spin - polarized electrons to a controllable spin precession between the ferromagnetic source and drain .",
    "hybrid ferromagnetic / semiconductor and dilute - magnetic - semicondutor / non - magnetic semiconductor junctions constitute basic interfaces in which to investigate spin - polarized transport . however , the efficiency of spin - injection through ideal fm / nms interfaces turns out to be disappointingly small due to the large conductivity mismatch @xcite between the metallic ferromagnet and the semiconductor .",
    "the use of spin - selective interfaces can significantly enhance injection efficiencies @xcite .",
    "this can be accomplished by inserting spin - dependent tunnel barriers between the fm and the nms layers @xcite .",
    "particularly promising is spin injection from a dilute - magnetic semiconductor ( dms ) into a non - magnetic semiconductor ( nms ) .",
    "novel dms / nms junctions ( i ) minimize the conductivity mismatch problem and ( ii ) naturally incorporate spin dependency in the transmission process @xcite .",
    "as recently demonstrated , substantial spin injection can be achieved in these mn - based heterostructures @xcite .",
    "more recently , a novel large magnetoresistance effect has been observed in a dms / nms / dms geometries mol .",
    "an interesting observation of ref .",
    "@xcite is the dependence of the magnetoresistance effect on the thickness of the dms layers : the mr effect doubles with the dms thickness .",
    "available formulas describing gmr - type effects in magnetic / non - magnetic junctions assume 1d geometries with semi - infinite magnetic layers @xcite . in this case , the expressions for the electrochemical potentials for the spin - up and the spin - down electrons contain only decaying exponentials in the magnetic regions @xcite .",
    "the resistances in the parallel and antiparallel configurations are calculated assuming that the device extends for a spin - flip length into the magnetic contacts .",
    "in such an approach it is not clear how to properly take into account the voltage drop across the sample .    in this work",
    "we consider dms / nms / dms and fm / nms / fm 1d systems with _",

    "as detailed below , we describe diffusive transport in these structures via the usual diffusion theory of van son et al .",

    "the formulas for the magnetoresistance obtained within our treatment are in general different from the ones previously obtained in literature , even in the experimentally relevant regime @xmath1 and @xmath2 ; @xmath3 denote the spin - flip lengths in the dms and nms layers , respectively , @xmath0 is the length of each dms layer and @xmath4 is the length of the nms layer .",
    "however , in the case of a fm / nms / fm system where the conductivity mismatch is large , this difference is not important since the correction we find is very small in this case .",
    "for dms / nms / dms systems , on the other hand , the conductivity mismatch is small and the magnetoresistance effect can be large .",
    "our formulas significantly deviate from the earlier ones in this case , especially in the regime where @xmath5 , which can be magnetic - field dependent , is comparable to @xmath0 .",

    ", we define the relevant resistance change in the system with respect to the zero magnetic - field resistance @xmath71 , i.e. , @xmath72 .",
    "we find      note that @xmath71 is simply the combined nms / dms layer resistances @xmath74 , since no spin accumulation occurs for zero magnetic field . in eq .",

    "( [ resist ] ) and ( [ anti ] ) [ not the approximate one in eq .",
    "( [ ourdelta ] ) ] also vanishes in these limits .",
    "note that this vanishing of the resistance change is symmetrical in @xmath0 and @xmath52 as expected .",
    "earlier formulas in the literature do not show this symmetry since they assume different boundary conditions .",
    "in contrast to metallic fm / nms / fm systems , dms / nms / dms structures can have conductivities of the dms and nms regions which are comparable . besides , @xmath18 can be of the same order as @xmath0 in some experiments . experimental results in this case ,",
    "e.g. , the _ d _ dependence of the magnetoresistance effect , should be interpreted with the use of eq.([deltar0 ] ) . as we mentioned earlier , the magnetoresistance effect observed in ref . @xcite",
    "doubles with the dms thickness .",
    "let us find out whether our 1d formula can explain this observed thickness dependence .",
    "note that the _ d_-dependence in eq .",
    "( [ deltar0 ] ) appears through the @xmath80 term ( spin accumulation effect ) .",
    "since @xmath81 can in general be magnetic - field dependent , there is also a possible _ d_-dependence arising from the second term which describes the resistances of the dms leads .    in order to investigate in more detail the _ d_-dependence in @xmath76",
    ", we need to know the magnetic - field dependences of the quantities entering @xmath76 [ eq .",
    "( [ deltar0 ] ) ] , particularly the magnetic field dependence of the spin - dependent conductivities @xmath82 .",
    "unfortunately , these dependences are not known .",
    "however , we can still gain some insight into the problem by neglecting the magnetic field - dependence of the conductivities .",
    "in this case , the second term in eq.([deltar0 ] ) is zero and we can investigate the expected d - dependence arising from the spin - accumulation effect alone .",
    "note that the quantity @xmath70 is null in the absence of a magnetic field and increases as a function of it .",
    "hence , we plot @xmath76 as a function of degree of spin - polarization @xmath70 for different values of @xmath0 . figures 3(a ) , 3(b ) show plots of @xmath76 vs @xmath70 for different parameters .",
    "we have chosen the values of @xmath83 and @xmath84 corresponding to the real experimental situation of the ref .",
    "@xcite . from these plots",
    "we can see that even though the absolute value of the magnetoresistance is comparable to the experimental value , the _ d_-dependence is not as pronounced as in the experiment of ref .",
    "it is indeed true that the magnetoresistance effect is larger for increasing @xmath0 .",
    "however , this behavior only appears at values of @xmath18 comparable to the thickness @xmath0 and even for @xmath85 @xmath86 m @xmath87 , fig .",
    "3(b ) , the effect is way too small to explain the experimental data .",
    "we conclude that the spin accumulation effect by itself does not explain  with realistic parameters  the observed _ d_-dependence of the data in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us mention here the possibility to explain the experiment by the magnetoresistance of the leads , see the second term in eq .",
    "( [ deltar0 ] ) .",
    "control experiments on a layer of the dms injector material patterned into a hall geometry showed @xmath88 negative mr @xcite .",
    "however , the transport problem we deal with here can be shown to reduce to that of a 1d system @xcite .",
    "note that in the case when the magnetic field dependence of @xmath89 is well pronounced and for realistic values @xmath90 and for @xmath91 the first term in eq .",
    "( [ deltar0 ] ) is estimated as @xmath92 while the second term is of the order of @xmath93 .",
    "thus in the case when the magnetoresistance of the leads is not zero the @xmath0-dependence associated with it can be more pronounced than the one associated with the spin accumulation effect .",
    "_ some limiting cases .",

    "in addition @xmath107 thus in the middle of the sample the spin current polarization is exponentially suppressed . in the case of antiparallel configuration the corresponding values of @xmath108 at @xmath109 and @xmath110 can be obtained from formulas ( [ alpha ] ) and ( [ alpha1 ] ) , respectively , by replacing @xmath111 for @xmath112 .    in conclusion , we have derived the expressions for the resistances of fm / nms / fm ( or dms / nms / dms ) structures using physical boundary conditions at the corresponding interfaces .",
    "we have considered magnetic layers ( dms or fm ) of finite length @xmath0 . when the magnetoresistance of the contacts is negligible ( i.e. , when @xmath113 is not magnetic field dependent ) , we find that the @xmath0 dependence of the spin - accumulation contribution to the magnetoresistance is not enough to explain the experimental results of ref . @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in systems where @xmath113 is magnetic field dependent our formulas allow for a sizable @xmath0 dependence arising from the magnetoresistance of contacts .",
