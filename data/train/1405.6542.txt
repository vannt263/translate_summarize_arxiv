    "<S> hd  100546 is a well - studied herbig  be star - disk system that likely hosts a close - in companion with compelling observational evidence for an embedded protoplanet at 68  au . </S>",
    "<S> we present alma observations of the hd  100546 disk which resolve the gas and dust structure at ( sub)mm wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> the co emission ( at 345.795  ghz ) originates from an extensive molecular disk ( 390@xmath020  au in radius ) whereas the continuum emission is more compact ( 230@xmath020  au in radius ) suggesting radial drift of the mm - sized grains . </S>",
    "<S> the co emission is similar in extent to scattered light images indicating well - mixed gas and @xmath1m - sized grains in the disk atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> assuming azimuthal symmetry , a single - component power - law model can not reproduce the continuum visibilities . </S>",
    "<S> the visibilities and images are better reproduced by a double - component model : a compact ring with a width of 21  au centered at 26  au and an outer ring with a width of 75@xmath03  au centered at 190@xmath03  au . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of a companion and protoplanet on the dust evolution is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the companion at 10  au facilitates the accumulation of mm - sized grains within a compact ring , @xmath2  2030  au , by @xmath2  10  myr . the injection of a protoplanet at 1  myr hastens the ring formation ( @xmath2  1.2  myr ) and also triggers the development of an outer ring ( @xmath2  100200  au ) . </S>",
    "<S> these observations provide additional evidence for the presence of a close - in companion and hint at dynamical clearing by a protoplanet in the outer disk . </S>"
