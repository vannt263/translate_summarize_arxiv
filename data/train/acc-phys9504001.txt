    "a common tendency in design of modern accelerators is to minimize beam - chamber coupling impedances to avoid beam instabilities and reduce heating .",
    "even contributions from tiny discontinuities like pumping holes have to be accounted for , due to their large number , which makes analytical methods for calculating the impedances of small discontinuities very important . according to the bethe theory of diffraction by small holes @xcite ,",
    "the fields diffracted by a hole can be found as those radiated by effective electric and magnetic dipoles .",
    "the coupling impedance of pumping holes in the vacuum chamber walls has been calculated earlier @xcite using this idea .",
    "the imaginary part of the impedance is proportional to the difference of hole polarizabilities @xmath0 , where the magnetic susceptibility @xmath1 and the electric polarizability @xmath2 are small compared to the cubed typical dimension @xmath3 of the chamber cross section . from considerations of the energy radiated into the chamber and through the hole ,",
    "the real part of the hole impedance comes out to be proportional to @xmath4 , being usually much smaller than the reactance .    in the present paper",
    "we further develop this analytical approach by taking into account the reaction of radiated waves back on the discontinuity .",
    "it leads to a more general theory , and allows us to reproduce easily all previous results , including those about trapped modes due to small discontinuities .",
    "while our consideration here is restricted to small holes , it can be readily applied to other small discontinuities like enlargements or irises because the idea of effective polarizabilities works equally well in these cases also .",

    "the @xmath6 axis is directed along the pipe axis , a hole is located at the point ( @xmath7 ) , and a typical hole size @xmath8 satisfies @xmath9 . to evaluate the coupling impedance one has to calculate the fields induced in the chamber by a given current .",
    "if an ultrarelativistic point charge @xmath10 moves along the chamber axis , the fields harmonics @xmath11 produced by this charge on the chamber wall without hole would be @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 are eigenvalues and orthonormalized eigenfunctions ( efs ) of the 2d boundary problem in @xmath5 : @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the 2d gradient in plane @xmath5 ; @xmath17 ; @xmath18 means an outward normal unit vector , @xmath19 is a unit vector tangent to the boundary @xmath20 of the chamber cross section @xmath5 , and @xmath21 form a rhs basis .      at distances",
