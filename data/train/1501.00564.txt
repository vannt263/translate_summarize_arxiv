    "bitumen is one of the by - products of the refinery process of crude oil and a very viscous fluid .",
    "its main application is as a binder in road pavement  [ ] , because it combines many desirable properties : it is cheap , it adheres quite well to mineral filler particles and has suitable mechanical properties . among bitumen",
    "s mechanical properties , the shear viscosity is of special importance . to guarantee a cohesive pavement",
    ", the shear viscosity should not be too low , while high values are often associated with a brittle behavior  [ ] which facilitates the development of cracks and eventually leads to the deterioration of the pavement .",
    "bitumen s viscosity also has a great effect on the exploitation of bitumen reservoirs and transportation of bitumen .",
    "this is why the experimental literature reporting viscosity measurements of bitumen is so vast  [ ] .",
    "moreover , it is known that bitumen has a strong non - newtonian behavior especially at low temperatures  [ ] .",
    "the non - newtonian behavior is characterized by a strain rate dependent shear viscosity and is believed to originate from the specific molecular structure of bitumen  [ ] , containing in particular asphaltene nanoaggregates  [ ] .",
    "molecular dynamics ( md ) is a good tool to study the molecular structure of bitumen and of the asphaltene nanoaggregates  [ ] .",
    "md simulations can also quantify the mechanical properties of the material .",
    "indeed , there are a few numerical studies relating the shear viscosity of bitumen in the limit of vanishing strain rate to its molecular and supramolecular structure  [ ] . however , to our knowledge , there has been no md study relating the non - newtonian behavior of bitumen to its molecular structure , in particular to the nanoaggregate structure . that is the first aim of this article .",
    "a second aim is to compare the molecular structure of bitumen under shear to that of other complex systems such as colloidal suspensions  [ ] , polymer solutions  [ ] , and associative polymer networks  [ ] .",
    "the hope is then to gain some insights on which structural characteristics of bitumen to focus on to model its rheology .    in order to achieve these aims ,",
    "we used non - equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations with the sllod algorithm  [ ] . this algorithm is able to reproduce a shear couette flow , even far from equilibrium  [ ] and provide the value of the shear rate dependent viscosity .",
    "the sllod algorithm has been used to simulate shear flow of complex systems such as hyperbranched polymers  [ ] , associating polymer solutions  [ ] and ionic liquids  [ ] . in this paper",
    ", we applied it to cooee bitumen  [ ] , which is a four - component bitumen model describing a bitumen with generic mechanical properties  [ ] and molecular structure  [ ] .",
    "different temperatures were investigated in order to extrapolate the results to ambient temperature .",
    "the paper is organised as follows",

    "the chemical composition of bitumen is very complex  [ ] .",
    "however , the molecules in bitumen can be classified into dissolution classes .",
    "the sara classification  [ ] is one of the most common classifications and it distinguishes between saturated hydrocarbons , resinous oil molecules , called aromatic in the sara scheme , resin molecules and asphaltene molecules .",
    "all of the last three molecule types are aromatic and the molecular weight of asphaltene molecules is on average higher than that of resin molecules , which is higher than the resinous oil molecular weight . to obtain",
    "a simple model of a generic bitumen , one typical molecular structure for each class was chosen .",
    "the molecular structures chosen are shown in fig .",

    "the interaction potential between the united atom units contains four terms .",
    "the first term corresponds to an intermolecular potential .",
    "it is a lennard - jones potential of the form @xmath9 with parameters @xmath10  @xmath11 and @xmath12  k , where @xmath13 is the interatomic distance and @xmath14 the boltzmann constant .",
    "the method of shifted potential is used with a cutoff of @xmath15 @xmath16 .",
    "the three other terms of the interaction potential describe intramolecular interactions .",
    "they control the bond length between two connected particles , the angle between three consecutive particles , and the dihedral angle between four consecutive particles .",

    "the simulations were performed at four different temperatures : @xmath23  k , @xmath24  k , @xmath25  k , and  @xmath26  k and at constant density .",

    "+      in this work , the molecular version of the sllod algorithm  [ ] is used to obtain a shear flow of the bitumen mixture .",
    "the equations of motion in that case are given by : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the laboratory position and peculiar momentum of particle  @xmath35 in molecule  @xmath36 , respectively ( peculiar means that the corresponding velocities are relative to the streaming / flow velocity ) , @xmath37 is the force acting on particle  @xmath35 in molecule  @xmath36 , @xmath38 is the velocity gradient tensor , chosen here such that the @xmath39 component is @xmath40 and all other components are zero , @xmath41 is the position of the center of mass of molecule  @xmath36 , @xmath42 is the mass of molecule  @xmath36 , @xmath43 is the momentum of the center of mass of molecule  @xmath36 , @xmath44 is the number of particles in molecule  @xmath36 , and @xmath45 is the gaussian thermostat multiplier given by : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the force acting on molecule  @xmath36 and @xmath48 the total number of molecules .",
    "the expression for the thermostat multiplier @xmath45 corresponds to the application of gauss principle of least constraint , used to keep the molecular center of mass kinetic temperature constant .",
    "the algorithm used to propagate the sllod equations of motion is the operator splitting algorithm developed by pan _",

    "@xmath52 or @xmath53 independent initial configurations were used .",
    "the change in density from one initial configuration to the other is less than @xmath54  @xmath55 .",
    "the averages and standard errors shown in this paper correspond to the averages and standard errors over these independent simulations .",
    "four main rheological properties can be computed from the nemd simulations under shear .",
    "they are the shear viscosity  @xmath56 , the first and second normal stress coefficients  @xmath57 and  @xmath58 , and the non - equilibrium molecular pressure  @xmath59 .",
    "they provide information about the newtonian and non - newtonian behavior of the fluid .",
    "these quantities are derived from the molecular stress tensor  @xmath60 , given by the irving - kirkwood formula  [ ] : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the volume of the system , @xmath63 denotes a time average over the non - equilibrium steady state , @xmath64 is the vector between the centers of mass of molecules  @xmath36 and  @xmath65 , @xmath66 is the intermolecular force acting on molecule  @xmath36 due to molecule  @xmath65 and @xmath67 is the force acting on particle  @xmath35 in molecule @xmath36 due to particle  @xmath68 in molecule  @xmath65 .      due to the shear geometry enforced in the simulation ,",

    "the viscosity is decreasing with increasing shear rate and the cooee bitumen is consequently a shear - thinning fluid .",
    "this is consistent with most experimental data on bitumen  [ ] .",
    "however , bitumen has a broad range of behavior with shear rate and can also be shear - thickening  [ ] .",
    "moreover , the higher the temperature , the higher the shear rate at which the fluid enters the newtonian regime in the cooee model .",
    "thus , the newtonian plateau is clearly visible at temperature  @xmath26  k and barely noticeable at temperature  @xmath23  k in the range of shear rates accessible to nemd simulations .",
    "in other words , over the whole range of shear rates spanned , the change in viscosity is larger at low temperatures than at high temperatures .",
    "this is in agreement with the experimental literature  [ ] , stating a more pronounced non - newtonian behavior of bitumen at low temperatures .",
    "the zero shear rate viscosity  @xmath71 can be determined using two empirical models to fit the data .",

    "the values of the parameters corresponding to the carreau - yasuda and cross models are given in tables  [ tab : carreau ] and  [ tab : cross ] for all temperatures .",
    "the values of the zero shear rate viscosity  @xmath71 should be taken with care for the two lowest temperatures as the newtonian regime is not clearly visible .",
    "the values of these different parameters will now be discussed .",
    "both models obtain similar values for the viscosity at zero shear rate , which gives some confidence in the quality of the data .",

    "k the experimental values for the viscosity can vary from @xmath79  pa@xmath7s  [ ] to more than @xmath80  pa@xmath7s  [ ] .",
    "the value found in this work around  @xmath79  pa@xmath7s at  @xmath23  k is consequently at the lowest end of the broad range obtained experimentally for different bitumen mixtures .",
    "the values of the time constant  @xmath73 in the carreau - yasuda model and of the consistency index  @xmath77 in the cross model are also quite close to each other .",
    "they can be interpreted as the longest rotational relaxation time in the system  [ ] .",
    "the rotational relaxation time of the asphaltene molecules was estimated at temperature  @xmath24  k and density  @xmath29  kg@xmath7m@xmath28 at equilibrium in an earlier work  [ ] .",
    "it was evaluated as the time needed for the rotational correlation function to decay to @xmath81 and was found to be equal to @xmath82  s. this value is very close to the value of the time constants @xmath83  s and @xmath84  s found at the same temperature and density in this work from the carreau - yasuda and cross fits , respectively .    finally , the cross model does not seem to fit the data as well as the carreau - yasuda model for high shear rates , despite that the former model was designed to improve the fit at high shear rates by introducing a viscosity at infinite shear rate  @xmath76 .",

    "[ ] for equilibrium simulations .",
    "the nanoaggregates are composed of all the aromatic molecules and are branched .",
    "the branched structure arises from the asphaltene molecules having two flat parts , a head and a body , oriented in different directions .",
    "each part can align to other flat aromatic molecules creating a branched structure  [ ] . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the linear segments of these branched structures , because their size distribution has been studied in detail at equilibrium in an earlier work  [ ] , but the presence of the branched structure should be kept in mind .",
    "the definition of a linear segment sums up to the following rule : two aromatic molecules are nearest neighbors in the same nanoaggregate if they are `` well - aligned '' and `` close enough '' . only the alignment of aromatic molecules to an asphaltene body and not to an asphaltene head is considered here , to extract purely linear structures .",
    "all molecules connected by this rule are part of the same linear nanoaggregate .",
    "the same rule was used in the nemd simulations and the average number of aromatic molecules in a linear nanoaggregate could be quantified for different shear rates .",

    "the full distribution of the number of aromatic molecules in a linear nanoaggregate at low shear rates is also very close to the same distribution at equilibrium as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : aggregatesizevsshearrate ]  ( b ) . at these low shear rates ,",
    "the size distribution has a biexponential shape , which we attributed , in a previous work  [ ] , to longer nanoaggregates being less bent and containing more asphaltene molecules than smaller ones .",
    "after a plateau at low shear rates , the nanoaggregate size decreases quite sharply with increasing shear rate until it reaches a value close to  @xmath86 , indicating that nearly all nanoaggregates are reduced to single molecules .",
    "in other words , the shear flow induces nanoaggregate rupture .",
    "figure  [ fig : aggregatesizevsshearrate ]  ( b ) shows that at the highest shear rate and at temperature  @xmath24  k some longer nanoaggregates still remain but with a low probability .",
    "interestingly , figure  [ fig : aggregatesizevsshearrate ]  ( b ) also shows that at high shear rates the size distribution is closer to a single exponential distribution .",
    "however , no noticeable variation of the relative composition of the nanoaggregates with their size was seen when the shear rate is increased ( not shown ) .",

    "concurrently , the fraction of resin and resinous oil molecules in the nanoaggregates tends to decrease with increasing temperature in long nanoaggregates .",
    "it means that the overall decrease of the nanoaggregate size with temperature is mainly due to resin and resinous oil molecules being excluded from the aggregates at large temperatures .",
    "the asphaltene molecules stay aggregated even at large temperatures .",
    "it is probably an effect of the cohesive energy being higher in absolute value between two asphaltene molecules than between two resin or two resinous oil molecules .",
    "this is itself due the difference in the sizes of the aromatic structures .",
    "asphaltene molecules have a larger aromatic structure than resin and resinous oil molecules , thus creating a larger @xmath90-stacking interaction between the aromatic planes of two asphaltene molecules than between two resin or resinous oil molecules . at high shear rates in fig .",
    "[ fig : aggregatesizevsshearrate ]  ( a ) , it seems on the contrary that the nanoaggregate size increases with increasing temperature .",
    "it is due to the fact that the shear rate at which the nanoaggregates begin to break up is not the same at all temperatures .",
    "the higher the temperature , the lower the shear rate needed to break up the nanoaggregates .",
    "this apparent crossover between the curves giving the nanoaggregate size versus the shear rate at different temperatures can be removed if the average nanoaggregate size is plotted versus the shear stress  @xmath91 rather than the shear rate  @xmath70 .",

    "[ fig : aggregatesizevsstress ]  ( c ) .",
    "this figure also shows that above a certain shear stress , all curves collapse .",
    "figure  [ fig : aggregatesizevsstress ]  ( c ) can be understood if one assumes that the size of the nanoaggregates depends on two factors : the thermal energy and the work done by the external shear force applied to the system .",
    "the thermal energy is directly proportional to temperature and the work done by the shear force can be estimated from the product of the shear stress  @xmath91 and the characteristic volume of an aromatic molecule in a nanoaggregate . at low shear stresses ,",
    "the work done by the shear force is negligible with respect to the thermal energy and the nanoaggregate size is determined by thermal energy alone .",
    "the nanoaggregates have then their equilibrium size . at high shear stresses , on the contrary ,",
    "the thermal energy is negligible with respect to the work done by the shear force and the nanoaggregate size is determined by the shear stress  @xmath91 alone .",
    "the curves at different temperatures collapse at high shear stresses . at intermediate values of the shear stress ,",
    "both factors play a role in the nanoaggregate size . in this intermediate regime ,",
    "an increase in shear stress at constant temperature results in a monotonic decrease of the nanoaggregate size and an increase in temperature at constant shear stress results in a monotonic decrease of the nanoaggregate size .",
    "the connection between the rupture of the nanoaggregates around a given shear rate and the variation of the viscosity with shear rate and temperature quantified in sec .",
    "[ sec : rheology ] is now discussed .",
    "the overall decrease of the nanoaggregate size with increasing temperature at low shear rates contributes to the decrease of the viscosity observed with increasing temperature in fig .",
    "[ fig : viscosityvsshearrate ] .",
    "the rupture of the nanoaggregates at high shear rates is consistent with a decrease in the viscosity at these same shear rates instead of a plateauing around the viscosity at infinite shear rate  @xmath76 , predicted by the cross model .",
    "the carreau - yasuda model does not postulate the existence of a constant viscosity at infinite shear rate .",
    "it could be why it better fits the data than the cross model , as was found in sec .",
    "[ sec : rheology ] .    moreover",
    ", the important change in the nanoaggregate size upon shearing could explain why the time - temperature superposition principle is not satisfied .",
    "indeed , the time temperature superposition typically works when all relaxation times have the same temperature dependence  [ ] . in the case of the cooee bitumen model , at least two main long relaxation times can be identified : the rotational relaxation time of the asphaltene molecules , close to the characteristic time  @xmath73 of the carreau - yasuda fit , and the inverse shear rate at which the nanoaggregates rupture . they have _ a priori _ different temperature dependences , which could explain why the time temperature superposition principle is not satisfied .",

    "this section focuses on the alignment of the molecules in the flow direction , also known as form birefringence .",
    "form birefringence is a departure from the isotropic equilibrium state of the fluid due to the applied velocity gradient .",
    "the anisotropy arises in this case from the alignment of the molecules in the flow direction  [ ] .",

    "the molecular order parameter for docosane increases monotonically to reach the value  @xmath108 at the highest shear rate simulated , showing an alignment of docosane molecules in the shear direction .",
    "this is consistent with the shear thinning behavior globally observed for cooee bitumen  [ ] . for asphaltene , resin and resinous oil molecules",
    "the curve is qualitatively different . at low shear rates , until a critical shear rate of approximately @xmath109  s@xmath8 at temperature  @xmath24  k is reached , the molecular order parameter of the three aromatic types is roughly constant and non - zero . above this critical shear rate ,",

    "this unusual behavior of the molecular order parameter is easily explained if the presence of nanoaggregates at low shear rates is considered .",
    "indeed , the long nanoaggregates tend to align with respect to each other , due to steric hindrance , creating a slight anisotropy in the system .",
    "this anisotropy is also present at equilibrium . at equilibrium",
    ", it was previously determined  [ ] that long nanoaggregates contain more asphaltene molecules than resinous oil molecules and that the resin content is the smallest .",

    "this indicates that the increase of the molecular order parameter for shear rates higher than @xmath110 is due to the alignment of the single molecules in the flow direction .",

    "+    with the md simulations which we carried out , we can not know whether the global anisotropy of the system is a finite size effect or if it is also seen in macroscopic samples . in this last case , bitumen could resemble the nematic phase of a discotic liquid crystal , formed by the stacking of disk - shaped molecules  [ ] . experimentally , it is known that there is a change of the supramolecular structure of bitumen with the concentration of asphaltene molecules . at low concentrations , small and isotropically distributed nanoaggregates can be seen . at larger concentrations ,",

    "figure  [ fig : molecularorderparamdifftemp ] shows the variation of the molecular order parameter of the four different molecule types with shear rate for different temperatures . from fig .",
    "[ fig : molecularorderparamdifftemp ] , it is quite clear that for all molecule types , the molecular order parameter at a given high shear rate increases with decreasing temperature .",
    "this is due to the fact that for a given shear rate at low temperatures the stress felt by the molecules is higher and the alignment in the direction of the flow is more pronounced than at high temperatures . at low shear rates ,",
    "the behavior is quite different from one molecule type to another . for docosane molecules ,",
    "the molecular order parameter  @xmath132 decreases with increasing temperature , for the same reason as at high shear rates . for resin and resinous oil molecules the molecular order parameter",
    "also decreases with increasing temperature at low shear rates .",
    "this is probably because as the temperature increases , the resin and resinous oil molecules are more often present as single molecules than in long nanoaggregates ( see fig  [ fig : aggregatesizevsshearrate ]  ( d ) ) , which reduces their global ordering .",
    "in contrast , asphaltene molecules stay in long nanoaggregates even at high temperatures and their molecular order parameter is nearly independent of temperature at low shear rates .",
    "an interesting feature can be noticed for the molecular order parameter  @xmath133 of asphaltene molecules at high temperatures .",
    "looking closely at the data of fig .",
    "[ fig : molecularorderparamdifftemp ]  ( a ) at temperature  @xmath26  k , one can note three different regimes with increasing shear rate : at low shear rates @xmath133 is mostly constant , at intermediate shear rates @xmath133 slightly decreases with the shear rate , and finally at large shear rates it increases .",
    "the intermediate shear rate range corresponds roughly to  @xmath134 $ ]  s@xmath8 for temperature  @xmath26  k. at these shear rates , the average number of molecules in the nanoaggregates is still very close to its equilibrium value as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : aggregatesizevsshearrate ]  ( a ) .",
    "consequently , the decrease in the molecular order parameter of the asphaltene molecules in this intermediate shear rate range can be interpreted in the following way : the nanoaggregates are still well formed , but the shear flow is strong enough to disturb the alignment of the nanoaggregates with respect to each other causing the order parameter to locally drop . at higher shear rates the nanoaggregates break ,",
    "the molecules align in the shear direction and the molecular order parameter increases again .",
    "this intermediate drop of the molecular order parameter  @xmath133 of asphaltene molecules is also noticeable for temperature  @xmath25  k , but not for lower temperatures .",
    "it might be because the nanoaggregates break before the shear flow is strong enough to modify the alignment of the nanoaggregates with respect to each other .",
    "the direct consequence of this reorganization of the nanoaggregates with respect to each other on the behavior of the viscosity with the shear rate is unclear . in total , the fluid is shear - thinning in this range of shear rates , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : viscosityvsshearrate ] .",
    "this global behavior could be mainly due to the alignment of the docosane molecules in the shear direction , the order parameter of the resin and resinous oil molecules being nearly constant in this range .",
    "the variation of the molecular alignment angle  @xmath100 is plotted for each molecule type versus the shear rate  @xmath70 at temperature  @xmath24  k in fig .",
    "[ fig : molecularanglevsshearrate ]  ( a ) .",
    "the typical behavior for a polymer solution under shear is the following : in the newtonian regime , the molecular alignment angle is around  @xmath135  degrees and in the non - newtonian regime , the molecular alignment angle decreases until reaching zero .",
    "the value of  @xmath135  degrees is expected in the newtonian regime , due to the nonuniform distribution of angular velocity of the molecules in the shear flow  [ ] . at larger shear rates ,",
    "the molecules align to the shear flow resulting in a vanishing molecular alignment angle .",
    "this general behavior is roughly seen for all molecule types in fig .",
    "[ fig : molecularanglevsshearrate ]  ( a ) , though the error bars are very large at low shear rates .",
    "the large error bars at low shear rates can be explained by the fact that at these shear rates the nanoaggregates are well formed and tend to align with respect to each other , giving rise to the slight anisotropy of the whole sample .",
    "the alignment of the nanoaggregates with respect to each other causes the set of the angles with the shear direction to be ill - spanned compared to an isotropic material .",
    "the error bars decrease when the nanoaggregates are ruptured .",
    "this happens at quite large shear rates , when the single molecules begin to align in the flow direction , so that the angle of  @xmath135  degrees is not clearly visible .",
    "furthermore , at high shear rates , the values of the molecular alignment angle  @xmath100 for different molecule types are ordered according to the molecular weight , the molecules with the highest weight having the lowest alignment angle .",
    "it is expected as the difference in velocity from one end of the molecule to the other is larger for large molecules than for small molecules , giving rise to an alignment in the flow direction at lower shear rates .",
    "finally , figs .",
    "[ fig : molecularanglevsshearrate ]  ( b ) and ( c ) show the molecular alignment angle of asphaltene and docosane molecules , respectively , at different temperatures .",
    "the molecular alignment angle of resin and resinous oil molecules at different temperatures is not displayed for the sake of readability and resembles that of the asphaltene molecules at different temperatures .",
    "for both asphaltene and docosane molecules , the lower the temperature , the closer to zero the angle to the flow direction for a given high shear rate .",
    "this is consistent with the molecular order parameter being higher for low temperatures than for high temperatures at a given high shear rate .",
    "the error bars on the alignment angle of asphaltene molecules are large up to very high shear rates for high temperatures , consistent with the nanoaggregates being maintained up to these high shear rates . due to the large error bars , the existence of the intermediate range of shear rates identified in fig .",

    "the variation of the radius of gyration with temperature and with shear rate is very different from one molecule type to another . for asphaltene and resinous oil molecules , figs .",
    "[ fig : radiusofgyrationvsshearrate ]  ( a ) and  ( c ) respectively , the radius of gyration barely changes with the shear rate .",
    "it is expected as nearly all carbons in these molecules are aromatic creating a stiff intramolecular structure . however , at the largest shear rates the radius of gyration increases slightly indicating a stretching of the bonds . for both molecule types",
    "the radius of gyration increases with increasing temperature , indicating a stretch of the stiff bonds due to a higher velocity of each bead .    for docosane and resin molecules , figs .",
    "[ fig : radiusofgyrationvsshearrate ]  ( b ) and  ( d ) respectively , the trends are very different .",
    "both molecule types can possess a maximum of their radius of gyration at a given shear rate . for linear molecules such as docosane molecules ,",
    "this behavior is known  [ ] and is attributed to a stretching of the bonds in the flow direction for intermediate shear rates and a coiling up of the whole molecule at very high shear rates when each molecule tumbles more often .",
    "the maximum in the radius of gyration of linear molecules is usually associated with a clear minimum of the pressure of the system  [ ] .",
    "it is not seen in the case of the cooee bitumen model , probably because other molecules play a part in the value of the pressure as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : normalpressure ] .",
    "we attribute the maximum seen for resin molecules at a given shear rate to a similar effect , because resin molecules have some long linear alkyl chains aside from the aromatic plane , in contrast to resinous oil and asphaltene molecules .",
    "finally , for both docosane and resin molecules , the radius of gyration decreases with increasing temperature .",
    "this could also be an effect of the larger velocity of each bead , causing coiling of the molecules when the bonds are less stiff than in pure aromatic molecules .",
    "+    another informative quantity which can be defined to describe the intramolecular structure is the bond order tensor  @xmath139 .",
    "it is defined for docosane molecules as : @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the number of bonds in a docosane molecule , @xmath142 is an average over docosane molecules and over time , and @xmath143 is the unit vector between neighboring atoms  @xmath35 and  @xmath144 given as : @xmath145 in a similar way as for the molecular order tensor  @xmath92 , a bond order parameter  @xmath139 and a bond alignment angle  @xmath146 can be defined from the bond order tensor  @xmath147 .",
    "these two quantities measure the extent of the alignment of intramolecular bonds to the shear direction and the angle between them .",
    "figures  [ fig : bondorderparamvsshearrate ]  ( a ) and ( b ) show the variation of the bond order parameter  @xmath139 and the bond alignment angle  @xmath146 of docosane molecules with the shear rate for different temperatures .",
    "both quantities have similar variations with shear rate and temperature as their molecular counterparts . as the shear rate increases ,",
    "the bonds inside the docosane molecules become more and more aligned in the direction of the shear . this effect gets stronger as the temperature decreases .",
    "it is also consistent with the shear - thinning behavior observed in sec .",
    "[ sec : viscosity ] .",
    "the bond order tensor associated with aromatic molecules is less well defined , because the bonds form rings and are not clearly oriented from one end of the molecule to the other .",
    "that is why it is not calculated here .",
    "however , as shown by the variation of the radius of gyration of the aromatic molecules with the shear rate , the stretching of the molecules is less pronounced for stiff aromatic molecules than for linear ones .",
    "changes in the intramolecular structure of the aromatic molecules probably contribute very little to the shear - thinning behavior generally observed .",
    "non - equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations under shear have been performed for the first time on a bitumen mixture .",
    "they reveal both the non - newtonian regime of such mixtures and their microscopic structure .",
    "the non - newtonian regime is characterized by a shear rate dependent viscosity , decreasing normal stress coefficients , and a monotonically increasing pressure .",
    "the cooee bitumen is found to be shear - thinning at all temperatures investigated in line with most experimental results on bitumen  [ ] .",
    "the shear - thinning behavior is in agreement with the variation of some characteristics of the inter- and intramolecular structure with the shear rate :    * the saturated hydrocarbon molecules , which can be seen as solvent to the nanoaggregates , align with respect to each other and align their bonds in the shear direction , at all shear rates .",
    "* at high shear rates , the nanoaggregates disintegrate and the single aromatic molecules align in the shear direction .",
    "some characteristics of the inter- and intramolecular structure of the cooee bitumen do not change with the shear rate and do not seem to prevent the shear - thinning behavior from being established .",
    "they are :    * until a critical shear rate , dependent on the temperature , the nanoaggregate size distribution is unchanged with increasing shear rate . *",
    "the intramolecular structure of the aromatic molecules , composing the nanoaggregates , is mainly constant up to quite high shear rates .",
    "finally at high temperatures , there is a domain of intermediate shear rates , where the nanoaggregates still have their equilibrium size , but where the molecular order parameter of asphaltene molecules decreases with increasing shear rate .",
    "the decrease of the molecular order parameter indicates a perturbation of the alignment of the nanoaggregates with respect to each other , due to steric hindrance , by the shear flow .",
    "the effect of this local reorganization on the variation of the viscosity with the shear rate is unclear and could be masked by the inter- and intramolecular alignment of the solvent molecules .",
    "in addition , the variation of the rheological properties and of the corresponding molecular structure with temperature was studied .",
    "as expected , the viscosity decreases with increasing temperature , following an arrhenius law . the nanoaggregate size decreases with increasing temperature , which also contributes to the decrease of viscosity with temperature .",
    "the increase in viscosity at low temperatures and at a given shear rate explains some of the characteristics of the molecular structure :    * the solvent molecules begin to align in the shear direction at lower shear rates at low temperatures than at high temperatures .",
    "* the nanoaggregates break up at a lower shear rate at low temperatures than at high temperatures .",
    "this is also due to the nanoaggregates being longer at low temperatures than at high temperatures .",
    "the study of the structure and rheology of the bitumen mixtures at different temperatures enables us to compare the behavior of a bitumen mixture with other complex systems such as colloidal suspensions , polymer solutions and associative polymer networks .",
    "the comparison with these complex systems is relevant because they have similarities with a bitumen mixture .",
    "indeed , the cooee bitumen mixture can be seen as a solution of partly flexible nanoaggregates of various sizes  [ ] , with a branched structure  [ ] , in a saturated hydrocarbon solvent , as was already mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : aggregatesize ] .",
    "furthermore , the nanoaggregate size depends on temperature and shear rate as was seen in sec .",
    "[ sec : molstruc ] .",
    "it is known that both the linear rheological properties such as the zero shear rate viscosity and the non - linear rheological properties of colloidal suspensions and polymer solutions depend on the size , the shape and the polydispersity of the dispersed objects  [ ] . in the limit of a dilute solution of such objects , a lot is known on the relation between the intrinsic viscosity  @xmath148 $ ] , defined by @xmath149 \\phi + o(\\phi)$ ] , where @xmath150 is the zero shear rate viscosity of the solvent and @xmath151 the volume fraction of objects , and the shape of the colloids or the topology of the polymers  [ ] .",
    "the shear - thinning behavior at high shear rates can also be related to the topology of the polymers , though for complicated topology such as dendrimers , quantitative models are not available yet to predict the exponent of the decay of the viscosity in the limit of infinite shear rate  [ ] . at high volume fractions of objects , a higher order expansion of these linear and non - linear rheological properties with the volume fraction",
    "is needed , because the interactions between the colloids or polymers can not be neglected  [ ] .",
    "bitumen mixtures typically fall in this range , which makes a direct and quantitative comparison with what is known of the rheological properties of dilute and semi - dilute polymer solutions of different topologies difficult .",
    "another characteristic of bitumen which makes a direct comparison with colloidal suspensions or polymer solutions difficult is the fact that nanoaggregates are maintained by weak interactions and their size depends on temperature and shear rate .",
    "this is usually not the case for colloids and for polymer solutions .",
    "theoretical  [ ] and numerical  [ ] studies have been carried out on the linear and non - linear rheological properties of solutions of associative polymers , where the size of the assemblies also depends on temperature and shear rate .",
    "there is for example a growing literature on the rheology of telechelic polymer networks  [ ] and of wormlike micelles  [ ] .",
    "however , the knowledge in this field is still scarce and very specific to the precise topology of self - assembly studied  [ ] .",
    "it is consequently not so easily transferable to bitumen .",
    "nevertheless , the current knowledge on the rheology of colloidal suspensions , polymer solutions and associative polymer solutions defines a framework which can be used to better understand bitumen .",
    "the size , the polydispersity and the topology of the nanoaggregates as well as the interaction between the nanoaggregates are expected to be the important parameters controlling the rheological properties of bitumen . we hope that the numerical study carried out in this paper can be used as a step towards an analytical modeling of the rheological properties of bitumen based on these parameters .",
