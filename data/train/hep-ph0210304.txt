    "more than a half century ago , dirac s paper on the forms of relativistic dynamics @xcite introduced the front - form hamiltonian approach .",
    "applications to quantum mechanics and field theory were overlooked at the time due to the appearance of covariant perturbation theory .",
    "the reemergence of front - form dynamics was largely motivated by simplicity as well as physicality .",
    "the light - front approach has the largest stability group @xcite of any hamiltonian theory .",
    "today the physical connection to light - front dynamics is transparent : hard scattering processes probe a light - cone correlation of the fields . not surprisingly , then , many perturbative qcd applications can be treated on the light front , see e.g. @xcite . outside this realm , physics on the light cone",
    "has been extensively developed for non - perturbative qcd @xcite as well as applied to nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "this paper concerns current matrix elements between bound states of two particles in the light - front formalism .",
    "we approach the topic , however , from covariant perturbation theory . as demonstrated by the tremendous undertaking of @xcite",
    ", one can derive light - front perturbation theory for scattering states by projecting covariant perturbation theory onto the light cone , thereby demonstrating their equivalence  including the delicate issue of renormalization .",
    "as to the issue of light - front bound states , a reduction scheme for the bethe - salpeter equation recently appeared @xcite that produces a kernel calculated in light - front perturbation theory . for the purpose of simplicity , we consider only bound states of two scalars interacting via the exchange of a massive scalar in the @xmath0-dimensional ladder model .",
    "this work supersedes our original investigation @xcite .",
    "our main consideration is to extend the reduction to current matrix elements to investigate valence and non - valence contributions in the light - front reduced , bethe - salpeter formalism .",
    "thus we calculate our model s form factor ; moreover , in @xmath0 dimensions we can not choose a frame of reference where z - graphs vanish .",
    "this enables us to completely investigate their contribution , which in @xmath1 dimensions has a variety of applications such as generalized parton distributions @xcite .",
    "these applications are pursued elsewhere @xcite .",
    "z - graph contributions haunt light - front dynamics since non - valence properties of the bound state are involved , so that valence wave function models can not be utilized directly . on one hand ,",
    "the light - cone fock representation provides expressions for the z - graph contributions in terms of fock component overlaps which are non - diagonal in particle number @xcite . while on the other hand , vertices which can not be related to the valence wave function ( coined as _ non - wave function vertices _ in @xcite ) appear in the light - front bethe - salpeter formalism .",
    "a variety of ways have been proposed for dealing with these non - wave function vertices @xcite .",
    "we also note that one can avoid the issue by attempting to model the covariant vertex @xcite , or ( when possible ) estimating the contribution from higher fock states @xcite .    below",
    "we show that non - wave function vertices are supplanted by contributions from higher fock states in light - front time - ordered perturbation theory ( provided the interaction has light - cone time dependence ) .",
    "in essence contributions from non - wave function vertices are reducible and should only be used when the interaction is ( or is approximately ) instantaneous .",
    "this constitutes a replacement theorem for non - wave function vertices which trivially extends to @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "first in section [ lfcqm ] we present the issue of non - wave function vertices and energy poles of the bethe - salpeter vertex focusing on the light - front constituent quark model as an example .",
    "non - wave function vertices are required to express the form factor .",
    "we find the commonly used assumptions in quark models necessitate vertices not only without energy poles but without energy dependence .",
    "next in section [ reduce ] we review the reduction of the bethe - salpeter equation presented in @xcite focusing on the energy poles of the vertex .",
    "we derive an interpretation of the reduction as a procedure for approximating the poles of the vertex .",
    "additionally in this section we construct the gauge invariant current to be used with the reduced formalism . in section [ meat ]",
    "the ladder model is presented and we compare the calculation of the form factor for the model using two different paths to the reduction .",
    "the comparison allows us to see when non - wave function vertices can be efficiently used .",
    "lastly we summarize our findings in section [ sum ] .",
    "to introduce the reader to non - wave function vertices and instantaneous approximations , we focus on light - front constituent quark models .",
    "we start by writing down the covariant equation for the meson vertex function @xmath2 .",
    "it satisfies a simple bethe - salpeter equation @xcite ( see figure [ fbs ] ) : @xmath3 in which we have defined the bethe - salpeter wave function @xmath4 as @xmath5 with the two - particle disconnected propagator @xmath6 . for scalars of mass @xmath7 ,",
    "the renormalized , single - particle propagator @xmath8 has a klein - gordon form @xmath9 + i \\epsilon},\\ ] ] where the residue is @xmath10 at the physical mass pole and the function @xmath11 characterizes the renormalized , one - particle irreducible self - interactions . to simplify the comparison carried out in section [ meat ] , we shall ignore @xmath11 .",
    "above @xmath12 is the irreducible two - to - two scattering kernel which we shall refer to inelegantly as the interaction potential .",
    "now we imagine the initial conditions of our system are specified on the hypersurface @xmath13 .",
    "we define the plus and minus components of any vector by @xmath14 .",
    "correlations between field operators evaluated at equal light - cone time turn up in hard processes for which this choice of initial surface is natural . in order to project out the initial conditions ( wave functions , _",
    "etc_. ) of our system , we must perform the integration over the fourier conjugate to @xmath15 , namely @xmath16 . for instance",
    ", our concern is with the light - front wave function defined as the projection of the covariant bethe - salpeter wave function onto @xmath17 , @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "looking at eq .",
    ", in order to project the wave function exactly , we must know the analytic structure of the bound - state vertex function .",
    "if the vertex function @xmath20 had no poles in @xmath21 , then our task would be simple : the light - front projection of @xmath4 would pick up contributions only from the poles of the propagator @xmath22 .",
    "next we observe from eq .",
    ", that the @xmath21 dependence of the interaction @xmath23 must give rise to the @xmath21 poles of the vertex function @xmath20 .",
    "hence an instantaneous interaction gives rise to an instantaneous vertex and a simple light - front projection ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , constituent quark models often assume a less restrictive simplification of the analytic structure of the vertex ( see e.g.  @xcite ) in order to permit the light - cone projection .",
    "we shall show that this assumption along with the presumed covariance of the quark model often implies instantaneous vertices .",
    "for any momentum @xmath24 , let us denote the on - shell energy @xmath25 .",
    "the propagator @xmath22 has two poles @xmath26 notice that although we work in @xmath0 dimensions , the results are trivial to extend to @xmath1 dimensions because the imaginary parts of poles have precisely the same dependence on ( only ) the plus - momenta .",
    "this remark applies not only to this section but to the rest of this work .    in constituent quark models @xmath2 is assumed to have no poles in the upper - half @xmath16-plane for @xmath27 . since the light - front wave function is proportional to @xmath28 $ ] , in light of eq .",
    "we further require any poles of @xmath2 to lie in the upper - half plane for @xmath29 and in the lower - half plane for @xmath30 . with these restrictions eq",
    ".   dictates the form of the constituent quark wave function @xmath31,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined the weinberg propagator as @xmath32 and used the abbreviation @xmath33 to denote evaluation at the pole @xmath34 appearing in eq .  .",
    "when we calculate the ( elastic ) electromagnetic form factor for these constituent quark models ( see figure [ ftri ] ) , we are confronted with more poles .",
    "let @xmath35 be the plus - component of the momentum transfer between initial and final state mesons .",
    "the form factor is then @xmath36[(p - k)^2 - m^2][(k+\\delta)^2 -m^2]}\\ ] ] the @xmath16-poles from the propagators are @xmath37 defined in and @xmath38 .    given this pole structure , the contributions to @xmath39 are proportional to @xmath28 $ ] . in the region @xmath40 , closing the contour in the upper-(lower- )",
    "half plane will enclose possible poles of the final ( initial ) vertex .",
    "as one can see from considering the region @xmath41 , the form factor can be determined solely from @xmath42 . in @xmath1 dimensions , where we are free to choose frames in which @xmath43 ,",
    "this is the only contribution to the form factor .",
    "but if @xmath44 , the additional poles from vertices in the region @xmath45 are required by lorentz invariance .    the authors @xcite advocate no modification to the pole structure of eq .   due to the vertices",
    "closing the contour in the lower - half plane , they pick up the residue at @xmath46 without any contributions from poles of the initial - state vertex .",
    "such poles can not lie in the upper - half plane for @xmath40 since the form of @xmath47 would be both frame dependent and contrary to that of eq .",
    "( the @xmath1-dimensional version of which is employed by @xcite ) .",
    "thus the authors are actually assuming there are no poles of the bethe - salpeter vertex @xcite .",
    "returning to the definition of the wave function under the premise of a vertex devoid of poles , we now find @xmath48 , which we shall call pole symmetry .",
    "this symmetry is essential for making contact with the drell - yan formula @xcite , since for @xmath41 both initial- and final- state vertices may be expressed in terms of wave functions . when @xmath40 , however , the final - state vertex becomes @xmath49 which can not be expressed in terms of @xmath50 ( where @xmath51 ) even with pole symmetry .",
    "such a vertex is referred to as a non - wave function vertex .",
    "understanding and dealing with such objects from the perspective of time - ordered perturbation theory is the primary goal of this paper .    because these constituent quark models are presumed covariant , eq",
    ".   converges .",
    "this enables us to relate an initial - state non - wave function vertex to the final - state non - wave function vertex encountered above via integrating around a circle at infinity . equating the sum of residues @xmath52 , we find @xmath53 this relation holds for the class of models for which the pole structure of eq",
    ".   is not modified by the vertices .",
    "the ratio structure of the vertices does not allow for a common factor @xmath54 in the two terms in eq .  .",
    "the equality then depends on delicate cancellations between initial- and final- state vertices , which in general are unrelated .",
    "the philosophy of constituent quark model phenomenology is to choose the form of @xmath47 and hence the form of @xmath2 . treating @xmath2 free",
    ", equality can only hold if both ratios are one .",
    "this yields the restriction @xmath55 but @xmath56 only enters @xmath57 through @xmath58 .",
    "hence @xmath2 is independent of @xmath16 . in general , of course , the vertex @xmath2 not only has light - front energy dependence but poles as well . as we shall see below",
    ", the light - front reduction of the bethe - salpeter equation is a procedure for approximating the poles of the vertex function .",
    "moreover when applied to current matrix elements , these poles generate higher fock state contributions .",
    "in this section , we review the reduction scheme set up in @xcite since their notation , while useful , is unfamiliar . additionally we resolve a peccadillo intrinsically related to non - wave function vertices .",
    "next we give an intuitive picture for the reduction and finally construct the gauge invariant current for the calculation of form factors on the light - front .    above",
    "we have removed overall momentum - conserving delta functions , e.g. our propagator @xmath22 is the momentum space version of @xmath59 defined by @xmath60 . in terms of these fully two - dimensional quantities ,",
    "the lippmann - schwinger equation for the two - particle transition matrix @xmath61 appears as @xmath62 a pole in the @xmath61-matrix ( at some @xmath63 , say ) corresponds to a two - particle bound state .",
    "investigation of the pole s residue gives the bethe - salpeter equation for the bound - state vertex @xmath2 @xmath64 the bethe - salpeter amplitude @xmath65 is defined to be @xmath66 .",
    "following @xcite , we denote quantities able to be rendered in position or momentum space with bras and kets .",
    "we will employ this notation only for quantities that have been stripped of their overall momentum - conserving delta functions , for example @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is used as a label for the bound state for which @xmath63 .      to reduce the lippmann - schwinger equation to a light - front version , we must introduce an auxiliary green s function @xmath69 in place of @xmath70 ( as in @xcite ) .",
    "thus we have @xmath71 provided that @xmath72 taking residues of eq .",
    "gives us an alternate way to express the bound state vertex function @xmath73    to choose a light front reduction , @xmath69 must inherently be related to projection onto the initial surface @xmath17 . for simplicity , we denote the integration @xmath74 . with this notation",
    ", we will always work in @xmath0-dimensional momentum space for which the only sensible matrix elements of @xmath75 are of the form @xmath76 .",
    "the operator @xmath77 is defined similarly . for a useful reduction scheme ( one that preserves unitarity ) , we must have @xmath78 .",
    "the simplest choice of @xmath69 that results in time - ordered perturbation theory requires @xmath79 where the reduced disconnected propagator @xmath80 is defined by the matrix elements @xmath81 explicitly this forces @xmath82",

    "we are more careful about this point than the authors @xcite since the consequences of eq .",
    "are essential for dealing with instantaneous interactions .",

    ", gives a homogeneous equation for the reduced vertex function @xmath89 @xmath90 given this structure , the reduced kernel @xmath91 will always be @xmath92 \\theta[y(1-y)]$ ]",
    ". moreover the reduced vertex @xmath93 $ ] as a result of eq .  .",
    "from we can define the light - front wave function @xmath94 , notice this too restricts the momentum fraction @xmath95 : @xmath96 $ ] . by iterating the lippmann - schwinger equation for @xmath61 twice ,",
    "it is possible to relate @xmath61 to @xmath97 and thereby construct @xmath61 given @xmath97 , which is clearly not possible from the definition . taking the residue of this relation between @xmath61 and @xmath97 yields the reduced - to - covariant conversion between bound - state vertex functions , namely @xmath98 as the light - front wave function since latexmath:[$\\big| \\ ; |\\psi_{r}\\rangle =      while all light - front reduction schemes when summed to all orders yield the @xmath17 projection of the bethe - salpeter equation , the choice of @xmath86 in eq",
    ".   generates a kernel calculated in light - front time - ordered perturbation theory .",
    "lastly the normalization of the covariant and reduced wave function is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the heart of our intuition about the light cone lies in integrating out the minus - momentum dependence of the covariant wave function .",
    "so we merely cast the formal reduction in a way which highlights the contributions from poles of the vertex function .    utilizing eqs . and",
    ", we can show @xmath100 thus the appearance of @xmath101 has the form of an instantaneous approximation since eq .",
    "shows that it has no minus - momentum poles besides those of the propagator @xmath59 .",
    "this instantaneous approximation appears in determining the light - front wave function . using eqs .   and",

    ", we are led to the approximate solution @xmath105 in the formal reduction scheme , we have iterated the covariant bethe - salpeter equation @xmath106-times and subsequently made an instantaneous approximation via eq .  .",
    "retaining the minus - momentum dependence in @xmath12 to @xmath107 order allows for an @xmath107-order approximation to the vertex function s poles .",
    "here we extend the formalism presented so far to include current matrix elements between bound states .",
    "we do so in a gauge invariant fashion following @xcite .",
    "our notation , however , is more in line with the elegant method of gauging equations presented in @xcite .",
    "this latter general method extends to bound systems of more than two particles .",
    "consider first the full four - point function @xmath108 defined by @xmath109 for later use , it is important to note that the residue of @xmath110 at the bound state pole @xmath63 is @xmath111 . using the lippmann - schwinger equation for @xmath61 , we can show the four - point function satisfies @xmath112    to discuss electromagnetic current matrix elements , we will need the three - point function @xmath113 where the label @xmath10 denotes particle number .",
    "we define an irreducible three - point function @xmath114 in the obvious way @xmath115 now we need to relate the one - particle electromagnetic vertex function to the @xmath61 matrix .",
    "let @xmath116 denote the electromagnetic coupling to the constituent particles ( since our particles are scalars @xmath117 ) .",
    "since the electromagnetic three - point function @xmath114 is irreducible , we have @xmath118 and by using the definition of @xmath108 eq .  [ g4 ] , we have the desired relation @xmath119 notice the right hand side lacks the particle label @xmath10 .",
    "in the first term , the bare coupling acts on the @xmath10th particle while in the second term the bare coupling does not act on the @xmath10th particle .",
    "for this reason we have dropped the label which will always be clear from context .    in considering two propagating particles interaction with a photon ,",
    "the above definitions lead us to the impulse approximation to the current @xmath120 additionally the photon could couple to interacting particles . define a gauged interaction @xmath121 topologically by attaching a photon to the kernel in all possible places .",
    "this leads us to the irreducible electromagnetic vertex @xmath122 defined as ( see figure [ fgamma ] ) @xmath123 which is gauge invariant by construction .",
    "lastly to calculate matrix elements of the current between bound states it is useful to define a reducible five - point function ( see figure [ f5pt ] ) @xmath124 having laid out the necessary facts about electromagnetic vertex functions and gauge invariant currents , we can now specialize to their matrix elements between bound states by taking appropriate residues of eq .  .",
    "the form factor is then @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "to say anything less than general , we must know the minus - momentum dependence of the interaction .",
    "we therefore adopt a weakly coupled , one - boson exchange model for @xmath12 ( the so - called ladder approximation ) .",
    "supposing the boson mass is @xmath128 and the coupling constant @xmath129 , we have @xmath130 where the energy pole ( with respect to @xmath24 ) of the interaction is @xmath131 this interaction is non - local in space - time and hence does not have an instantaneous piece . the reduced kernel eq .",
    "is consequently made up of retarded terms ( i.e.  dependent on the eigenvalue @xmath132 ) where higher order in @xmath133 means more particles propagating at a given instant of light - cone time ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "@xmath137 solutions to eqs .   and",
    "coincide  both wave functions approach @xmath149 .",
    "secondly , we preserve the contact interaction limit by excluding from @xmath138 the factor @xmath28\\theta[y(1-y)]$ ] . that is , when @xmath150 with @xmath151 fixed ( or equivalently @xmath152 ) we have the contact interaction - dimensional light - cone model , in which @xmath153 , has been considered earlier in @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath154 , which rightly knows nothing about the momentum fractions @xmath95 and @xmath155 .",
    "we shall now investigate contributions to the form factors for each of the models eqs .   and .      from eq",
    "we can calculate the form factors for each of the models and in the reduced formalism .",

    "the interaction again is crossed ( @xmath208 ) and represents pair production . with eqs .   and , we have both bare - coupling pieces of the full born series for the photon vertex ( further terms in the series , which result from higher order terms in the expansion of @xmath209 , add interaction blocks to each diagram on the quark - antiquark pair s path to annihilation ) . in this way we recover the green s function from summing the born series @xcite .",
    "notice also the above form of @xmath210 is what one would obtain from extending the definition of @xmath89 as a non - wave function vertex @xcite .",
    "for the case of an instantaneous interaction , the light - front bethe - salpeter formalism automatically incorporates crossing .",
    "to summarize , the non - valence contribution to the instantaneous model s form factor is @xmath211 and involves crossed interactions or equivalently non - wave function contributions .",
    "now we compare the form factors for the cases of instantaneous and non - instantaneous interactions .",
    "in the instantaneous limit @xmath137 , however , we understand the behavior of the wave functions .",
    "the wave functions eq .   and eq .   both become narrowly peaked about @xmath212 in the large @xmath213 limit , _ cf _ the behavior of @xmath214 . since we are investigating non - valence contributions to",
    "_ form factors _ , we choose additionally to solve for the instantaneous wave function to first order in @xmath145 ( see eq .  [ instw ] ) to put the wave functions on equal footing : i.e.  @xmath215 , because the difference @xmath145 is presumed small .",
    "this has the efficacious consequence of producing identical leading - order terms _ cf _ eq .   and eliminates the issue of normalization .",
    "the optimal choice of the instantaneous interaction is not under investigation here .",
    "so we shall simplify matters further by choosing @xmath216 in eq .  .",
    ".numerical solution of the bound - state equation eq .   for various values of @xmath213 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath217 . [ cols=\"<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     for a few values of @xmath213 , we solve for the wave function using eq .  .",
    "in table [ bsvals ] , we list the values of @xmath213 used as well as the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath132 ( all for the coupling constant @xmath217 , where @xmath218 ) . we then calculate the form factors in the instantaneous and non - instantaneous cases .",
    "we arbitrarily choose @xmath219 .",
    "in @xmath0 dimensions , this fixes @xmath220 .",
    "the ratio of these form factors  defined using eqs .",
    "( [ fflo],[nvni],[nvi ] ) , namely @xmath221 is plotted versus @xmath222 in figure [ it ] .",
    "the figure indicates the form factors are the same in the large @xmath213 limit .",
    "since the leading - order contributions are identical , the figure additionally shows the ratio of non - valence contributions to the form factor , namely @xmath223 this ratio too tends to one as @xmath213 becomes large , of course not as rapidly .",
    "thus for finite @xmath213 , we must add the correction @xmath145 in eq .   which results in higher fock contributions present in the non - instantaneous case .",
    "lastly we remark that all of this is analytically clear : having eliminated different @xmath213 dependence hidden in @xmath47 and @xmath146 , expressions for form factors in the instantaneous and non - instantaneous cases are identical to leading order in @xmath224 , i.e.  @xmath225 while the remaining non - valence contributions @xmath226 match up with @xmath227 and @xmath210 , respectively , to @xmath224 .",
    "of course we have demonstrated the replacement of non - wave function vertices only to first order in perturbation theory .",
    "schematically , we have required @xmath228 this is merely the condition that corrections to @xmath138 from finite @xmath213 are larger than second - order corrections from the reduction scheme in eq .  .",
    "quantitatively this condition translates to @xmath229 . if this condition is met , the leading corrections are all of the form @xmath145 and the instantaneous model becomes the ladder model ( and non - wave function vertices disappear when calculating the form factor ) .",
    "when the condition is not met , but holds to @xmath230 ^ 2 v$ ] , say , we must work up to second order in the reduction scheme and use the second born approximation .",
    "we do not pursue this lengthy endeavor here , since for the non - instantaneous case @xmath231 $ ] necessarily excludes non - wave function contributions in time - ordered perturbation theory .",
    "in fact at any order in time - ordered perturbation theory we expect to find a complete expression for the form factor in terms of fock component overlaps devoid of non - wave function vertices , crossed interactions , _",
    "above we investigate current matrix elements in the light - front bethe - salpeter formalism .",
    "first we present the issue of non - wave function vertices by taking up the common assumptions of light - front constituent quark models . by calculating the form factor in frames where @xmath44 , lorentz invariance mandates contribution from the vertex function s poles .",
    "quark models which neglect these residues and postulate a form for the wave function are assuming not only a pole - free vertex , but a vertex independent of light - front energy .",
    "these assumptions are very restrictive .",
    "this leads us formally to investigate instantaneous and non - instantaneous contributions to wave functions and form factors necessitating the reduction formalism eq .  .",
    "we provide an intuitive interpretation for the light - front reduction , namely it is a procedure for approximating the poles of the bethe - salpeter vertex function .",
    "this procedure consists of covariant iterations followed by an instantaneous approximation _ cf _ eq .  , where the auxiliary green s function @xmath69 enables the instantaneous approximation , see eq .",
    "in order to calculate form factors in the reduction formalism , we construct the gauge invariant current eq .  .",
    "using the ladder model and an instantaneous approximation we compare the calculation of wave functions and form factors in the light - front reduction scheme .",
    "calculation of form factors is dissimilar for the two cases . in the ladder model , which is non - instantaneous , non - wave function vertices",
    "are excluded in time - ordered perturbation theory . for the instantaneous model ,",
    "however , contribution from crossed interactions is required . moreover ,",
    "these instantaneous contributions derived are identical in form to non - wave function vertices used in constituent quark models . as a crucial check on our results",
    ", we take the limit @xmath137 for which the ladder model becomes approximately instantaneous . in this limit ,",
    "calculation of the form factors for the two models is identical .",
    "the net result is an explicit proof , for @xmath0 dimensions , that non - wave function vertices are replaced by contributions form higher fock states if the interactions between particles are not instantaneous .",
    "we call this a replacement theorem .",
    "the analysis relies on general features of the pole structure of the bethe - salpeter equation in light - front time - ordered perturbation theory .",
    "therefore it is trivial to extend the theorem to @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "the real question which remains is whether or not the interaction between light quarks can be approximated as instantaneous .",
    "we intend to learn how to use experimental data to answer this question .",
