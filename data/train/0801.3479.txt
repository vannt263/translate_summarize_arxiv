    "hypervelocity stars ( hvss ) , a class of recently discovered objects , are a probe linking the central black hole and its history to the outer halo .",
    "hvss probably originate from interactions with the black hole ; they travel out into the halo and beyond , serving as tracers of the galactic potential on scales from 5 pc to 10@xmath0 pc .    to make testable predictions of the relationships between the observable properties of hvss and aspects of the galactic center and halo",
    ", we adopt the massive black hole ( mbh)-binary star interaction first proposed by hills @xcite as the injection mechanism for hvss .",
    "we then explore the impact of the galactic potential , the properties of binaries in the galactic center , the mass function in the galactic center , and stellar evolution on the observable spatial and velocity distributions of hvss as a function of stellar mass .",
    "@xcite showed that hvss are inevitable when sufficiently tight binary stars are disrupted by the tidal field of the central mbh .",
    "much later , @xcite analyzed the production of hvss and argued that the hills production rates were excessive .",
    "they considered other mechanisms for the production of hypervelocity stars including interactions of single stars with a binary central black hole .",
    "in 2005 , @xcite reported the first discovery of a hvs .",
    "the star , sdss j090745.0 + 024507 , is leaving the galaxy with a heliocentric radial velocity of 853@xmath512 km  s@xmath6 and has the largest velocity ever observed in the milky way halo .",
    "subsequent photometry revealed that the object is a slowly pulsating b main - sequence star @xcite .",
    "only interaction with a massive black hole can plausibly accelerate a 3 m@xmath1 main - sequence b star to such an extreme velocity .",
    "the @xcite discovery inspired further observations along with a wealth of theoretical models .",
    "@xcite discovered a hypervelocity main sequence b star plausibly ejected from the lmc and @xcite reported a helium - rich subluminous o star probably ejected from sgr a@xmath7 .",
    "these three first discoveries were serendipitous .",
    "@xcite then carried out a targeted search for hypervelocity stars by using the sdss to select faint b - type stars with lifetimes consistent with travel times from the galactic center but that are not a normally expected stellar halo population .",
    "so far this extensive survey has yielded another 7 hypervelocity stars @xcite .",
    "the velocity of each of these stars exceeds the escape velocity from the milky way .",
    "the observational discoveries have inspired theorists to reconsider production mechanisms and ejection rates of hypervelocity stars .",
    "ejection mechanisms include the original hills binary encounter with a mbh @xcite , encounters between single stars and binary black holes @xcite , encounters of single stars with an intermediate mass black hole ( imbh ) inspiraling toward a mbh @xcite , and single star encounters with a cluster of stellar mass black holes ( smbhs ) around a mbh @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite predicted hypervelocity ejection of tight binary stars in interaction with a central binary mbh .",
    "discovery of a single tight binary hvs would be a strong indication of a central binary mbh .    absent the discovery of a binary hvs , distinguishing among the ejection mechanisms requires predictions of the resulting spatial and velocity distribution of the hvss along with computation of expected ejection rates ( e.g. sesana et al 2006 , 2007a ) .",
    "for example , the @xcite mechanism may produce the largest velocities @xcite and a binary black hole may produce an anisotropic distribution of ejecta @xcite .    dynamical and evolutionary considerations for stellar populations near the  also constrain hvs ejection mechanisms .",
    "for example , observations of the current population of b stars at the  favor the @xcite mechanism over models involving an inspiraling imbh or a cluster of smbhs @xcite .",
    "ejection rate estimates depend on an understanding of the way stars are scattered onto orbits intersecting the mbhs `` loss cone '' and on the specific ejection mechanism .",
    "perets et al ( 2007a , 2007b ) argue that scattering by giant molecular clouds gives hvs production rates from binary disruption by a single mbh that are consistent with the observations .",
    "in addition to the hvss , all of the ejection mechanisms produce a bound population of ejecta ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite demonstrate the very probable presence of a bound population of ejected b stars .",
    "these stars have velocities between 275  and 450 . in this velocity range",
    "the brown et al surveys detect 18 outgoing stars and only 1 incoming star , consistent with the @xmath8 200300  myr lifetime of these main sequence stars and a galactic center origin ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    because hvss travel across the galaxy , they are powerful tracers of the galactic potential @xcite .",
    "@xcite emphasize that the population of bound and unbound ejecta constrain the anisotropy of the halo independent of the ejection mechanism .",
    "the power of hvss as probes of the galactic center and as tracers of the galactic potential provides strong motivation for acquisition of larger samples of these objects .",
    "brown et al .",
    "focus on b stars because these objects are not an indigenous population in the halo and they are observable to large distances where the contrast between the density of hvss and any indigenous population is largest .",
    "@xcite suggest searches for possibly more numerous old - population , lower mass hvss .",
    "detection of lower mass hvss could provide strong tests of models for their origin .      in the @xcite mechanism , hvss naturally sample both the stellar mass function and the properties of the binary population in the galactic center .",
    "the ejecta then traverse the galaxy and become observable in the halo .",
    "we show that the observable velocity and spatial distributions of hvss are sensitive to the galactic potential , particularly on scales of 5200 pc from the .",
    "these distributions also reflect stellar evolutionary timescales .",

    "motivated by @xcite , we extend the simulations to cover lower mass stars and unequal mass binaries . in ",
    "2.2 we derive forms for the galactic potential which are a good representation of the observations from 510@xmath0 pc .",
    "our results show that most of the deceleration of hvss occurs within the central 200 pc of the galaxy ; thus , a proper fit to the observations in this region is a crucial step in understanding hvss .    in  2.3 ,  2.4 , and  2.5 , respectively , we describe our integration of hvs orbits through the galaxy , the procedure we use to construct mock catalogs of hvss , and the impact of azimuthal deflections on hvs orbits .",
    "we continue with more detailed discussions of the observable properties of hvss in a simple spherically symmetric potential (  3 ) and in a three - component galaxy (  4 ) .",
    "one of the most striking general results of this investigation is that a central potential which matches observations in the central 200 pc of the galaxy acts as a high pass filter preventing lower velocity hvss from reaching the halo .    in  3 and  4",
    "we predict the spatial and velocity distributions of hvss as a function of stellar mass and we address the underlying physical explanations for the behavior of these distributions . in  5 we connect the predictions with the observations by calculating relative space densities as a function of stellar mass (  5.1 ) .",
    "this discussion emphasizes that the relative numbers of bound stars are sensitive to the mass function in the galactic center and relative stellar lifetimes ; relative numbers of unbound stars are nearly independent of stellar lifetime .",
    "in  5.2 and  5.3 we analyze some sample hvss search approaches .",
    "we argue that searches become increasingly difficult with decreasing stellar mass (  5.2 ) .",
    "we also demonstrate that short lifetimes make the discovery of post main sequence hvs unlikely .",
    "we conclude in  6 .",
    "in @xcite , we developed initial methods for predicting the observable velocity distribution of hvss in the galactic halo .",
    "we derived ejection velocities appropriate for a single mbh disrupting binaries with 34 primary stars and a realistic range of initial binary semimajor axes , @xmath9 .",
    "we then adopted a simple prescription for the galactic mass distribution , integrated the orbits of stars ejected from the , and computed a first approximation to the full observable phase - space distribution of ejected stars on radial orbits in the halo .",

    "we also predicted a population of ejected stars on bound radial orbits , then discovered by @xcite as a 3.5@xmath10 excess of b - type main sequence stars with velocities of 275400 km s@xmath6 .    here , we extend our analysis to consider a wider range of binary star masses and several galactic potentials .",
    "our goals are ( i ) to understand the relative frequencies of hvss and bound ejected stars as a function of stellar mass and ( ii ) to explore the sensitivity of observable hvs radial velocities on the galactic potential from 5 pc to @xmath11 pc .    as in @xcite ,",
    "we simulate the ejection of stars from the  in three steps .",

    "as outlined above , both of these inputs to our model are uncertain .",
