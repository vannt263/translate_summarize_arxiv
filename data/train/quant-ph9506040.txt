    "<S> according to the widely accepted opinion , classical ( statistical ) physics does not support objective indeterminism , since the statistical laws of classical physics allow a deterministic hidden background , while  as arthur fine writes polemizing with grnbaum  `` _ the antilibertarian position finds little room to breathe in a statistical world if we take laws of the quantum theory as exemplars of the statistical laws in such a world . </S>",
    "<S> so , it appears that , contrary to what grnbaum claims , the libertarians could have done otherwise does indeed find support from indeterminism if we take the indeterministic laws to be of the sort found in the quantum theory . _ ''    in this paper i will show that , quite the contrary , quantum mechanics does not save free will . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the epr experiments are compatible with a deterministic world . </S>",
    "<S> they admit a deterministic local hidden parameter description if the deterministic model is allowed to describe not only the measurement outcomes , but also the outcomes of the decisions whether this or that measurement will be performed . </S>",
    "<S> so , the derivation of the freedom of the will from quantum mechanics is a tautology : from the assumption that the world is indeterministic it is derived that the world can not be deterministic .    </S>",

    "<S> + +    to avoid a kind of `` comedy of errors '' i should specify in a very strict way what i mean under `` free will '' and how it relates to `` indeterminism '' . </S>",
    "<S> however , the full analysis of these two notions would be outside the scope of this paper . </S>",
    "<S> the only thing i can do is to describe that particular aspect of the question on which we focus our attention .    </S>",
    "<S> each arrow in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 symbolizes a particular item within the problem of the freedom of human action : how the mental states determine human actions , how the mental state at time @xmath0 is determined by the mental state at an earlier time @xmath1 , are the brain processes deterministic or indeterministic , how the mental states and the brain states are related , etc . without going to these details </S>",
    "<S> i would like to recall three different concepts of the freedom of the will .    * according to the commonsense understanding , the freedom of the will means that someone can do what he thinks to do . </S>",
    "<S> this concept of freedom is connected to the problem of relation between the acts and mind states . * according to another concept , free will means the subjective feeling of that someone s future decision or future thought is open for himself . in this way </S>",
    "<S> the freedom of the will relates to the problem of auto - predictability of an evolving system .    </S>",
    "<S> these first two interpretations of free will _ are entirely compatible with determinism _ :    in case a ) a deterministic world even helps to feel a real correlation between someone s action and thoughts .    in case </S>",
    "<S> b ) , as mackay ( 1967 ) proved by applying popper s ( 1982 ) result concerning the limitations governing auto - predictability of a deterministically evolving system , the subjective feeling of freedom is provided even if the world were as mechanical as clockwork .    </S>",
    "<S> now i offer to accept , for our purposes , campbell s definition of the freedom of the will :    * one s action is free only if one could have acted differently under the same circumstances . in other words , the relation between the acts at time @xmath0 and the circumstances ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) at time @xmath1 is _ not _ deterministic .    for sake of brevity i shall call this process starting with the given circumstances at time @xmath1 and terminating with the acts at time @xmath0 as `` choice process '' </S>",
    "<S> free will , as it is understood in c ) , is not accommodated in a deterministic universe . in a deterministic world </S>",
    "<S> the choice process is also deterministic , therefore campbell s freedom of the will , by definition , _ does not exist_.    [ [ section-1 ] ] 2 . </S>",
    "<S> + +    adolf grnbaum rejects campbell s conception of the freedom of the will as inadequate . </S>",
    "<S> he argues that _ we would not have this libertarian kind of freedom even if the choice process were governed by probabilistic laws_. the argument proceeds as follows .    </S>",
    "<S> suppose that an individual @xmath2 can act at time @xmath0 in various ways denoted by @xmath3 , given some fixed circumstances at time @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> assume we have a probabilistic theory describing his behavior according to which the probabilities of the different acts are @xmath4 ( each probability is different from 0 or 1 , otherwise the choice process would be obviously deterministic ) . </S>",
    "<S> one can interpret these probabilities as relative frequencies of the corresponding acts in two senses , either by taking a large statistical ensemble of identical @xmath2-like individuals , or by repeating many times the `` experiment '' with the same individual @xmath2 under the same circumstances .    </S>",
    "<S> _ does this probabilistic characterization of the choice process entail that an individual choice from the possible acts at time _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 _ is not determined in advance at time _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 _ ? </S>",
    "<S> _ grnbaum s answer is , definitely not . </S>",
    "<S> suppose a community , he argues , which is subject to an indeterministic law according to which , in a long run , 80 percent of the population will commit a certain kind of crime . </S>",
    "<S> we can hold those members of the community who commit the crime morally responsible for their behavior only if , as the libertarian standard would have it , they could have done otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> but , the statistical law does not entitle us to say of an individual who commits the crime that he could have done otherwise . to be sure , </S>",
    "<S> on the basis of the law we can not tell which particular individuals in the community will commit the crime . the law does not specify that . </S>",
    "<S> but this limitation does not entail that , in the very circumstances in which an individual commits the crime , he could have refrained from so doing .    however , as arthur fine ( 1993 ) pointed out , grnbaum s argumentation depends on whether , in principle , the probabilistic model in question admits a deterministic hidden variable theory . and </S>",
    "<S> this is the case only if the probability model is a classical kolmogorovian one , `` _ but as we have come to learn in connection with foundational studies in the quantum theory , just such counterfactual distinctions may turn out to have unexpected and testable consequences _ '' ,  as fine ( 1993 , p. 553 ) has rightly remarked . </S>",
    "<S> he turns then to prove `` the conflict between antilibertarianism and the quantum theory '' by considering a typical epr - type experiment . </S>",
    "<S> he concludes : `` _ if we assume that the quantum theory is correct in its statistical predictions and we hold to the reasonable no action - at - a - distance condition involved in the stated locality principle , then it follows that the statistical laws of the quantum theory can not be given an antilibertarian interpretation .... </S>",
    "<S> so , it appears that , contrary to what grnbaum claims , the libertarians could have done otherwise does indeed find support from indeterminism if we take the indeterministic laws to be of the sort found in the quantum theory . </S>",

    "<S> . 555 - 556 )    nonetheless , as fine himself remarks , `` _ the conclusion that grnbaum draws may turn out to be more robust than the particular argument he gives for it _ '' .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section-2 ] ] 3 . </S>",
    "<S> + +    let us turn now to a more careful analysis of the alleged conflict between antilibertarianism and the quantum theory . </S>",
    "<S> it is true that the quantum theory could turn out to be in conflict with antilibertarianism , but  as we will see it soon  _ it doesnt_.    to decide whether a probability model is classical or not one needs something more than the probabilities @xmath5 . until we do not consider the _ </S>",
    "<S> conjunctions _ of events @xmath3 , that is , the events like `` individual @xmath2 executes acts @xmath6 _ and _ @xmath7 '' , the probability model can be regarded as a classical / kolmogorovian one admitting deterministic hidden variable theory . </S>",
    "<S> so , we must assume that the probabilistic model provides not only the probabilities @xmath8 but also probabilities @xmath9 for some conjunctions @xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> and now we inquire : _ how should we imagine a probabilistic description `` of the sort found in the quantum theory '' for the choice process ? _    take a simple kind of example . </S>",
    "<S> assume a nurse can offer four different things to a baby : scrambled eggs , pudding , tomato juice and coke . </S>",
    "<S> each time she offers one kind of food together with one kind of drink .    </S>",
    "<S> the observed events are the followings :    [ cols= \" > , < \" , ]     for the probabilities of these events , in case of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , we have @xmath13 these statistical data agree with quantum mechanical results , in the sense that @xmath14 where the outcomes are identified with the following projectors @xmath15 of the hilbert space @xmath16 . the state of the system is assumed to be represented as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 .    </S>",
    "<S> nothing speaks against that the probabilities in ( [ facts1 ] ) and ( [ facts2 ] ) describe also the statistics of the baby s behavior if the nurse makes choice with equal frequencies between the two possible kinds of food and the two possible kinds of drink .    </S>",
    "<S> the numbers in ( [ qprob ] ) indeed violate the clauser - horne inequalities . _ but does it mean that the aspect experiment as well as our baby s behavior can not be accommodated in a deterministic universe , and consequently quantum mechanics provides the existence of campbell s freedom of the will ? _ not at all !    as it was shown in szab 1994 and szab 1995 , quantum mechanics itself turns out to be reducible , that is , it admits a local deterministic hidden variable theory . </S>",
    "<S> at least , this is proved for the epr experiments on which the libertarian quantum - indeterminists so often base their arguments . </S>",
    "<S> a `` deterministic universe '' includes not only the causal determination of the measurement outcomes , but it also includes causally deterministic decision processes of whether this or that measurement is being performed . no matter whether these decisions are made by machines like the switches in the aspect experiment or by human beings , such processes must be deterministic in a deterministic world . </S>",
    "<S> so , if we ask whether the aspect experiment admits a deterministic ( and local ) hidden variable theory , _ we must draw into the consideration the behavior of the switches , too _ </S>",
    "<S> ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> brans 1988 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that _ the whole system together can be deterministic _ : the probabilities in ( [ facts1 ] ) and ( [ facts2 ] ) form a correlation vector ( see pitowsky 1989 ) @xmath19 which satisfies pitowsky s geometric condition : it is in the classical correlation polytope , @xmath20 , which is a sufficient condition for reducibility , in the sense that the probability model in question is kolmogorovian and admits a local deterministic hidden parameter theory ( see szab 1995 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the same holds for the baby s choice example . in an entirely deterministic world not only the baby s behavior is deterministic , but the nurse s decision is deterministic , too . and _ the whole `` baby + nurse '' system can be accommodated in a deterministic world_. in other words , it can be the case that neither the nurse nor the baby has free will .    </S>",
    "<S> you may not like this solution of the problem , arguing that the nurse must have free will ( as well as the switches in the aspect experiment must be indeterministic ) by assumption . </S>",
    "<S> but it should be clear that in this case the derivation of the freedom of the will from the quantum theory becomes tautology : if there exists free will then free will exists . </S>",
    "<S> although , this result has been proved for a particular  but very important  case , one can not raise any objection against believing that the same holds for an arbitrary situation in the quantum theory . </S>",
    "<S> and if it is so , grnbaum s conclusion really `` turns out to be more robust than the particular argument he gives for it '' . </S>"
