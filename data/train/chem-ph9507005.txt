    "this fact has been used in the experimental study of `` level clustering '' in the rotational spectrum of h@xmath0se @xcite .",
    "it was established that the energy levels in the vibrational ground state of h@xmath0se form groups of four quasi - degenerate levels at the top of the @xmath1-multiplets when the value of the total angular momentum @xmath1 exceeds the critical value @xmath2 .",
    "this phenomenon is very unusual for the rotational spectrum of a rigid asymmetric top .    soon afterwards",

    "this extensive calculations show that the role of stretching vibrations in the bifurcation phenomenon is not clear enough . the rigid - bender model used in the early microscopic theory",
    "@xcite assumes the bond lengths to be fixed at their equilibrium values .",
    "this theory can not also answer the question if a bifurcation exists in the rotational bands of excited vibrational states .",
    "this deficiency is remedied in the present paper , which uses the fully - dimensional description of rovibrational motion in a triatomic molecule , the stretching vibrations being included .",
    "the analysis of the classical equations of motion is based on the study of small harmonic oscillations near stationary states of the system .",
    "four - dimensional oscillations can be separated into _ slow _ precessional and _ fast _ vibrational motion .",
    "the approach of the present work differs from the standard adiabatic approximation by born and oppenheimer in that it considers the rovibrational motion to take place near the stationary states of a fast uniformly rotating molecule instead of having them take place near the equilibrium state of a non - rotating molecule .",
    "the difference has very important consequences .",
    "first , the precessional motion of an ab@xmath0 molecule around the axis with minimal moment of inertia becomes unstable at the bifurcation point @xmath2 . for higher angular momenta ,",
    "the fast uniform rotation of a molecule takes place around two axes situated in the molecular plane between the axes of maximal and intermediate moments of inertia .",
    "owing to molecular symmetry , these two axes are equivalent .",
    "the delocalized precession around them may result in fourfold level clustering .",
    "this effect is the spectroscopic manifestation of the bifurcation .",
    "another consequence is the asymmetrical deformation of the ab@xmath0 molecule by centrifugal forces , whose anisotropic action on the b - atoms causes one a ",
    "b bond length to be longer than the other .",
    "this symmetry breaking of the molecular configuration in its turn changes the vibrational dynamics in such a way that the normal stretching modes @xmath10 and @xmath11 transform to the local vibrations either of two a  b bonds .",
    "it is important to note that the transition from normal mode to local mode vibrations is caused in our case by rovibrational interaction and not by the anharmonicity of the vibrations as in customary local mode theory ( see , for example , the review article @xcite ) .",
    "the developed theory allows to understand the relationship of local mode vibrations to a cluster formation in rotational spectra obtained by a model consideration in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the classical method developed here has been applied to the hydrides h@xmath0o , h@xmath0s , h@xmath0se , and h@xmath0te to demonstrate that it produces consistency with purely quantum mechanical calculations for quantities like the critical angular momentum , the bond length distortions and the bending angle of the rotating molecule .",
    "the results obtained for the h@xmath0te , h@xmath0se , h@xmath0s molecules are very close to those obtained previously , but for the lighter h@xmath0o molecule the bifurcation is found to occur at @xmath1 values significantly higher than those obtained in previous estimations .",
    "the most probable explanation of this is the neglect of the stretching vibrations in the earlier models .",
    "furthermore , our analysis shows also that the stretching vibrations result in drastic reduction of the potential barrier , which separates the two regions of a delocalized precession .",
    "thus it is very unlikely that the bifurcation in the vibrational ground state of h@xmath0o can result in an observable fourfold cluster structure .",
    "the clustering of levels can not therefore be the ultimate criteria of the bifurcation .",
    "we begin with the classical rovibrational hamiltonian which can be derived following the method of wilson , decius , and cross @xcite .",
    "our treatment differs from theirs in that we do not use normal coordinates to have the possibility of considering the large displacements from the equilibrium configuration .",

    "preliminary analysis of experimental data showed the tendency of levels to cluster in @xmath3 vibrational states of the h@xmath0o and h@xmath0s molecules @xcite . the cluster phenomenon has been found in variational quantum calculations for the excited vibrational states of h@xmath0se @xcite , h@xmath0s @xcite and h@xmath0te @xcite and very recently observed experimentally in the @xmath152 state of h@xmath0se @xcite .",
    "consider now in detail the molecular vibrational motion near the stationary states @xmath105 for @xmath153 and @xmath95 for @xmath106 .",
    "four normal modes of precession - vibration motion are described by four coupled eqs .",
    "( [ e : linz ] ) and ( [ e : linxz ] ) correspondingly .",
    "all these equations are not correct near the critical point @xmath2 where the rovibrational motion is strongly non - linear .",
    "it was shown above that the equations for the axial state @xmath105 ( and those for the state @xmath144 ) can be separated into two independent pairs when symmetrized stretching coordinates are introduced .",
    "when @xmath1= 0 the precessional motion is absent and the vibrational motion corresponds to the well - known picture of the normal vibrational modes @xmath10 , @xmath3 and @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this limit allows us to refer to the standard notations for a rotating molecule as well , i.e. , the frequency @xmath115 corresponds to the symmetrical stretching mode @xmath10 , the frequency @xmath116 corresponds to the bending mode @xmath3 , and the frequency @xmath117 corresponds to the antisymmetrical stretching mode @xmath11 .",
    "the difference from a non - rotating molecule consists in the effective potential for vibrations and in the equilibrium configuration , which is symmetrical but differs from that of non - rotating molecule . besides , the precessional mode with frequency @xmath132 appears and the antisymmetrical stretching vibration mixes with the precessional motion because of a rovibrational interaction .",
    "however this mixing is very weak .",
    "this can be seen from table [ tabl2 ] where the normalized amplitudes of four coordinates @xmath154 , @xmath123 , @xmath155 , and @xmath156 involved in a normal mode oscillations are given for the h@xmath0se molecule at @xmath1= 10 .",
    "it is seen from the table that the mixing of different types of motions is small and the character of the vibrations is close to the standard normal mode picture @xcite .",
    "the character of the oscillations changes drastically after the critical point @xmath2 .",
    "it is impossible to split the four equations ( [ e : linxz ] ) describing the small amplitude motion near the stationary state @xmath95 into two independent pairs because the molecular configuration is asymmetric and the uniform rotation of molecule around the axis in the @xmath41 plane mixes the symmetrical and antisymmetrical stretching vibrations . as a result ,",
    "the standard picture of normal mode vibrations , which is correct for the @xmath105 state , breaks down .",
    "this effect is illustrated in table [ tabl3 ] which shows normalized amplitudes of oscillations around the asymmetrical configuration of the state @xmath95 at @xmath1=16 ( @xmath96 = 26.08@xmath129 ) .",
    "it shows also that the precessional motion is mixed mostly with the bending vibration .",
    "it is worth noting that the vibrations in the mode with the frequency @xmath115 are localized predominantly on the bond @xmath83 and vibrations in the mode with the frequency @xmath117 are localized on the bond @xmath84 .",
    "this feature is inherent in local mode vibrations @xcite .",
    "however usually the local mode motion appears due to the strong anharmonicity as the stretching vibrations are increasingly excited . in our case the normal to local mode transition is a result of the symmetry breaking , which leads to the different force constants for two bonds and favors the local mode picture in the competition between kinetic and potential coupling between the local bond oscillators .",
    "accordingly the local character of the stretching motion strengthens with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "this follows from table [ tabl4 ] which shows normalized amplitudes of oscillations around the state @xmath95 at @xmath1=40 ( @xmath96 = 42.26@xmath129 ) .",
    "the classical calculations of the present work have shown that in non - linear ab@xmath0 molecules , a normal to local mode transition can be brought about by rotational excitation .",
    "similar results have been obtained in quantum numerical calculations with the morbid program @xcite .",
    "the classical analysis of precession - vibrational motion of the present work gives a physical picture of the phenomenon .",
    "that is , the bifurcation in a ground vibrational state breaks the molecular symmetry and changes both rotational and vibrational motions of the non - linear ab@xmath0 molecule resulting in the fourfold clusters and in the normal to local mode transition .",
    "the physical reasons for these phenomena lie in the molecular symmetry and in the anisotropic centrifugal force . therefore we should expect similar or even more interesting phenomena in the fast rotating molecules with higher symmetry .",
