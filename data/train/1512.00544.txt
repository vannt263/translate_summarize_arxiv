    "many individual cells , including white blood cells and bacteria , chemotax  sensing and following gradients of signals .",
    "some cells , though , are nt loners  they migrate collectively  and cells traveling in clusters and sheets during development must chemotax together .",
    "recent experiments @xcite show that clusters can have abilities that single cells lack : clusters of those cells can follow a gradient even when single cells do nt , or move in the opposite direction .",
    "one possible explanation for this is the qualitative model of collective guidance @xcite , in which a cluster of cells can gain a direction even though each of its individual cells senses only the level of signal , and not its gradient .",
    "we have recently introduced a model of collective guidance in the context of neural crest cells where the cluster s directionality comes from a regulation of contact inhibition of locomotion ( cil ) @xcite ; a related model was introduced for lymphocytes @xcite .",
    "however , the field s current understanding of collective guidance and how collective chemotaxis occurs without single - cell gradient sensing does not account for many aspects of a potential cluster response to a chemoattractant signal .",
    "a minimal model of collective guidance is that each cell only reacts to the local chemoattractant and the presence of its neighbors @xcite .",
    "more complicated signal processing could take place on the cluster scale if cells communicate with each other to collectively process the information contained in the chemoattractant gradient .",
    "what experimental signatures would tell us if this were happening , and how would this signal processing change the efficiency of the cluster s movement ?",
    "can collective signal processing overcome shallow gradients seen _ in vivo _ ( e.g. @xcite ) , amplifying differences in cluster behavior between the front and the back ? in minimal models of collective guidance @xcite , the cluster moves by a tug of war , and is likely under tension .",
    "nevertheless , collective chemotaxis can also occur in the absence of strong adhesion @xcite .",
    "how does this happen ?",
    "we will address all of these questions in this paper .",
    "collective chemotaxis and guidance are immediately relevant to both developmental and malignant processes _ in vivo_. in particular , we note border cell cluster migration in _ drosophila _ embryogenesis , in which a small cluster of border cells collectively follows gradients of chemoattractants including pvf1 @xcite . neural crest migration in xenopus also occurs collectively , and requires the neural crest chemoattractant sdf1 @xcite .",
    "these are two well - studied examples where there is also evidence for the collective guidance hypothesis ; however , as collective cell motility is ubiquitous in development @xcite , collective chemotaxis may be crucial whenever chemotaxis drives cell patterning .",
    "in addition , these topics have an important health relevance in collective cancer motility @xcite , as recent experiments suggest that tumor cell clusters are particularly effective metastatic agents @xcite .",
    "however , our initial focus will be on understanding _ in vitro _ experiments in relatively controlled environments @xcite , and using these results to develop a useful quantitative framework for the study of collective guidance , which can then be applied to understanding these _ in vivo _ situations",
    ".    we first study models of biochemical processing of the chemoattractant signal within the cell cluster , assuming strong cell - cell adhesions as in our earlier model @xcite .",
    "we treat the possibility of gradient sensing via cell - cell communication , using a mechanism that allows adaptation to a changing signal level : a local excitation , global inhibition ( legi ) scheme @xcite .",
    "we also consider the possibility of cluster - level amplification of a sensed gradient . with both adaptation and a switch - like amplification , we find that clusters of an optimal size are more efficient at chemotaxing than either smaller or larger clusters .",
    "amplification of the external signal allows clusters to develop a large velocity even in a shallow gradient .",
    "we argue , based on simple scaling principles , that sufficiently large clusters with only short - range adhesion undergoing collective guidance would be expected to either fragment or become increasingly slow .",
    "we then show that if the cohesion of a cluster is not controlled by local cell - cell adhesion , but rather by chemotaxis toward a secreted signal ( or  co - attraction \" @xcite ) , a cluster of cells can undergo collective guidance by regulation of cil even if cells are not in continuous contact .",
    "we show how co - attraction and regulated cil interact in order to create robust chemotaxis . in the presence of co - attraction , new behaviors , including persistent cluster rotation , may emerge .",
    "we provide an extensive characterization of the transition to rotation , and how rotation can alter the efficiency of gradient - sensing clusters .",
    "we want to model the collective guidance of a cluster of cells exposed to a chemical gradient @xmath0 ; we use the experiments of @xcite on neural crest cells as a guide to motivate the features we include , though we expect our results to be more generally applicable as well .",
    "there are four major elements of a model of this process : 1 ) single - cell dynamics , 2 ) physical interactions between cells and contact - range effects like contact inhibition of locomotion , 3 ) the response of the cells to the chemical @xmath0 , and 4 ) chemical communication and signaling between cells",
    ".    * single - cell dynamics . *",
    "we model single cell dynamics using a stochastic particle model that , in the absence of other cells , creates an unbiased persistent random walk even in the presence of a chemoattractant gradient .",
    "single isolated cells in our model have a behavior that is completely independent of the chemical signal @xmath0 .    * physical interactions and short - range contact inhibition of locomotion .",
    "* we include three short - range interactions between cells : cell - cell adhesion , exclusion of overlap between cells , and contact inhibition of locomotion ( cil ) .",
    "cil is a well - known property of many cell types in which cells polarize away from cell - cell contact @xcite .",
    "we model cil by assuming that the cell polarity , @xmath1 , which describes the cell s orientation and propulsion strength , is biased away from directions in which the cell touches another cell .",
    "the result of this assumption is that , consistent with experiments on neural crest cells @xcite , the outside edge cells of a cluster are polarized outward , while cells in the interior are unpolarized ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic]a ) .",
    "* response of cells to chemoattractant . * for a collective guidance mechanism to drive cluster motility , the polarization must be graded across the cluster . as the polarization of the cells at the edge",
    "is driven by cil , we assume that cil is regulated by the chemoattractant concentration @xmath0 .",
    "this is motivated by the result of ref .",
    "@xcite , who observe that protrusions on the outside of neural crest clusters are stabilized by the chemoattractant sdf1 .",
    "( the assumption that there is an interaction between chemoattractants and cil is also supported by other recent experiments @xcite , though we do not explicitly model their results here . )",
    "our earlier minimal model assumed that cil strength is proportional to the chemoattractant signal @xmath0 @xcite . in this work",
    ", we will also treat explicit models of the biochemical processing of the signal within cells , including a local excitation , global inhibition ( legi ) mechanism as well as potential amplification of the chemoattractant signal . in the legi model ,",
    "the signal creates both activator and inhibitor molecules within the cell , with the activator localized to each cell and the inhibitor free to diffuse between contacting cells via gap junctions .",
    "the activator positively regulates the susceptibility of cil , and the inhibitor negatively regulates it ( fig .  [",
    "fig : schematic]b ) .",
    "all of these mechanisms result in cells at higher values of @xmath2 having a larger susceptibility to cil , being more polarized , and the cluster moving up the gradient of @xmath2 ( fig .",

    "this mechanism can provide cohesion to a cluster even if cell - cell adhesion is completely absent .",
    "we use a two - dimensional stochastic particle model to describe cells exposed to a chemical gradient @xmath0 .",
    "we describe each cell @xmath5 with a position @xmath6 and a polarity @xmath7 .",
    "the cell polarity indicates its direction and propulsion strength : an isolated cell with polarity @xmath7 will travel with velocity @xmath7 .",

    "the three crucial elements of our simplified model are the finite polarity relaxation time @xmath15 , the rigidity of the cluster , and the tendency of co - attraction to polarize cells toward the center of the cluster .",

    "we also emphasize that this effect occurs in part because , when the cluster rotates as a rigid body , the polarity @xmath181 is constant in the frame of the substrate , rather than the frame of the rotating cluster .",
    "this effect may therefore be modified or absent in models that resolve , e.g. torques on individual cells or full cell structure .    *",
    "rotating clusters develop chirality - dependent drift * when the cluster develops a spontaneous rotation , this changes the underlying symmetries of our problem .",
    "ordinarily , for a roughly circular cluster , our system is symmetric with respect to inversions in the @xmath182 direction ( the direction perpendicular to the chemoattractant gradient ) .",
    "this suggests that the net drift in the @xmath182 direction should be zero .",
    "however , the rotation of the cluster gives it a handedness that breaks the @xmath182 inversion symmetry  allowing a net drift in the @xmath182 direction , whose sign would then depend on the handedness of the rotation .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : rot]a that this is the case .",
    "this gives a possible explanation for why , in fig .",
    "[ fig : coa]e , f , the chemotactic index of clusters decreases as cluster rotation begins . as shown schematically in fig .",

    "we can not explain this result in terms of the assumptions that led to eq .",
    "[ eq : transition ]  if we extend this model to have a position - dependent @xmath151 , it will predict that the drift in the y direction is zero .",
    "we suspect that this drift in our full model largely arises from co - attraction .",
    "small distortions in the cluster arising from the rotation can lead to a bias for cells that would otherwise see relatively weak gradients .",
    "however , we note that this particular mechanism requires cells that are sensitive to weak gradients in the co - attractant , and then amplify this into larger motion . we have found that handedness - dependent drift in our model is sensitive to details such as our assumption that cells respond equally strongly to weak and strong gradients of the co - attractant @xmath4 .",
    "we nevertheless want to highlight the chirality - dependent drift as a feature that is not excluded on symmetry grounds and may arise more robustly in other models .",
    "* combination of co - attraction and adaptation is similar to co - attraction in the minimal model *    here , we study our complete model , including both the legi adaptation mechanism and co - attraction .",
    "we show the phase diagram for how the chemotactic index @xmath87and the mean angular speed depend on the strength of cil @xmath133 and the strength of co - attraction @xmath145 in fig .",
    "[ fig : coaadapt]ab . as in our model with co - attraction , but no adaptation , we see rotation at large @xmath145 and a chemotactic index that is maximized at large @xmath145 and @xmath142 ( though reduced when rotation occurs ) .        when we plot the cluster velocity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : coaadapt]c ) , we note two features .",
    "first , we see that there is an apparent dip in velocity for intermediate numbers of cells , but then an increase at large cell numbers .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising given the combination of adaptation , for which we see a decrease in cluster velocity at large @xmath83 ( fig .  [ fig : adapt2])b , and co - attraction , where in the absence of adaptation , the cluster velocity increases consistently with increasing @xmath83 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : coa]b ) .",
    "secondly , the cluster speed is significantly smaller than seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : coa]b , even though the co - attraction and cil parameters have remained the same .",
    "this is a natural consequence of having cells only in transient contact , as the legi mechanism takes time to create a gradient in @xmath49 across an area of cells in contact .",
    "depending on the time required to form robust connections between cells , this effect could be aggravated  suggesting adaptation via legi may be more difficult for cells with transient junctions .",
    "however , we do see that as the number of cells increases , the cluster is still efficiently directed and @xmath87increases ( fig .  [ fig : coaadapt]d )",
    "in our earlier work @xcite , we provided a minimal quantitative model that embodied the collective guidance hypothesis @xcite and provides a plausible initial model for collective chemotaxis when single cells do not chemotax .",
    "however , this model made two fairly strict assumptions : first , that the cell does not perform any relevant internal processing of the chemoattractant gradient , and second , that the cluster was highly adherent with cohesion from short - range interactions . in this paper , we have relaxed both of these assumptions .",
    "we find , consistent with our earlier model and the experimental results of @xcite , that small clusters of cells can chemotax , even if single cells can not .",
    "however , while our minimal model predicts that both velocity and chemotactic index increase as cluster size increases , we find that adaptation to and amplification of the chemoattractant signal can lead to cluster velocity to decrease and chemotactic index to saturate at a value less than one at large cluster sizes . this effect can arise purely from the finite rate of gap junction mediated transfer of chemicals between contacting cells .",
    "however , even if gap junction transfer is fast , if the cell s response to the signal is switchlike , cluster velocities can be non - monotonic .",
    "this non - monotonic behavior is a sign of the way in which the cluster processes the chemoattractant signal .",
    "how does this compare to experimental results ?",
    "theveneau et al .",
    "@xcite find that chemotactic indices of small ( 2 - 3 cell ) and large clusters are similar , but do not observe a large variation in cluster speed . within our models with adaptation and amplification in adherent clusters , we see that chemotactic indices of 7 cell clusters and 61 cell clusters are often similar  but we generally observe that 2 - 3 cell clusters have smaller chemotactic indices .",
    "this is in part because of orientational averaging  under our assumption that single cells do not chemotax , pairs of cells have a chemotactic behavior that varies strongly with orientation @xcite .",
    "however , we highlight some difficulties with a direct comparison between model and experiment in this case . first , if cells have a distribution of cil strengths @xmath133 , we might expect that cells with higher cil strength @xmath133 form smaller clusters ; thus the strength of the collective guidance mechanism could be different between small and large clusters . secondly , the concentration of the chemoattractant sdf1 is not well - characterized in the bead assay used by @xcite ; more extensive studies using microfluidic chambers would aid in pinpointing differences between our model and experiments in neural crest .",
    "non - monotonicity can also make experimental results difficult to interpret . within our model with adaptation and amplification ,",
    "a given cluster could have either a larger or smaller velocity than a smaller cluster , depending on the sizes of the clusters and the details of the adaptation mechanism ( e.g. the rate of diffusion of the inhibitor ) .",
    "this suggests that solely comparing large and small clusters could potentially be misleading , and in general more detailed experiments as a function of cluster size are needed .    how generic is the result that sufficiently large tightly bound clusters decrease in speed",
    "we have found that this occurs both with adaptation and switch - like amplification , but not with the minimal model of @xcite .",
    "we expect this behavior to be relatively broadly present in sufficiently large , and sufficiently tightly bound clusters . in collective guidance in tightly adherent clusters , there is a tug - of - war , and the cluster is under tension , and would tear itself apart in the absence of the strong adhesion . in order for the cluster to maintain its speed as the number of cells increases , which increases friction between the cluster and the surface , the difference in protrusion strength between the front and back must also increase . in adaptation and switchlike amplification , this increase in protrusion strength is slow or absent , and the cluster slows at large @xmath83 .",
    "however , if the protrusion strength @xmath29 increases with cluster size , it will eventually overcome cell - cell adhesion  and we expect the cluster to eventually scatter , as in fig .  [",
    "fig : adapt1]b .",
    "generically , large tightly adherent clusters will either scatter or slow .",
    "our model for strongly adherent clusters has assumed that the primary driver of the dynamics of strongly adherent clusters are cells at the edge .",
    "this is consistent with the observations of @xcite on neural crest , who observe that only the edge cells develop strong protrusions : there are no cryptic protrusions . in small ( 2 - 30 cells ) adherent clusters of epithelial cells ,",
    "traction forces are also mainly found to be large at the edge @xcite .",
    "however , in other systems , most notably the classic example of migration of large epithelial sheets in a wound healing geometry , traction forces are also exerted significantly away from the edge @xcite .",
    "if these interior traction forces are relevant , we would expect the scaling of cluster velocity with cluster size to be significantly altered .",
    "ultimately , experimental traction force measurements may be crucial in determining whether our assumption of edge - driven dynamics is appropriate ; however , this assumption is consistent with the currently available data .",
    "adaptation in single - cell chemoresponse is a ubiquitous and well - tested principle , but its existence is not established for clusters of neural crest or lymphocytes ; applying a step response would be a straightforward test of adaptation , and we would expect protrusions and traction forces to peak and then adapt ( fig .",
    "[ fig : adapt1]a ) .",
    "our model of adaptation in the cell cluster is a legi model that allows cells and cell clusters to adapt to changing levels of chemoattractant and still gradient sense , but requires communication between cells .",

    "our hypothesis of gap junction mediated communication is consistent with the experimental observation that gap junctions modulate neural crest cell motility _ in vivo _",
    "we also note that a recent preprint has independently suggested that gap junctions play a role in gradient sensing and proposed a similar legi model @xcite , though solely in one dimension , and without any effects of cil , cell motility , or amplification .    in this paper",

    "our model with co - attraction also shows that , consistent with experiments on neural crest @xcite , that the collective guidance mechanism proposed here can guide cells even with only transient contacts .",

    "persistent rotation of cell clusters is not observed in neural crest , and only transient rotations appear to occur in lymphocytes undergoing collective chemotaxis @xcite .",
    "rotating droplets are , however , observed in bacteria and in the social amoeba dictyostelium discoideum ; vortex formation in bacteria has been speculated to also occur in part via chemotaxis to a secreted molecule @xcite though chemotaxis is not necessary and may not be relevant in dictyostelium @xcite .",

    "<S> single eukaryotic cells commonly sense and follow chemical gradients , performing chemotaxis . </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments and theories , however , show that even when single cells do not chemotax , clusters of cells may , if their interactions are regulated by the chemoattractant . </S>",
    "<S> we study this general mechanism of  collective guidance \" computationally with models that integrate stochastic dynamics for individual cells with biochemical reactions within the cells , and diffusion of chemical signals between the cells . </S>",
    "<S> we show that if clusters of cells use the well - known local excitation , global inhibition ( legi ) mechanism to sense chemoattractant gradients , the speed of the cell cluster becomes non - monotonic in the cluster s size  clusters either larger or smaller than an optimal size will have lower speed . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the cell cluster speed is a crucial readout of how the cluster processes chemotactic signal ; both amplification and adaptation will alter the behavior of cluster speed as a function of size . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that , contrary to the assumptions of earlier theories , collective guidance does not require persistent cell - cell contacts and strong short range adhesion to function . </S>",
    "<S> if cell - cell adhesion is absent , and the cluster cohesion is instead provided by a co - attraction mechanism , e.g. chemotaxis toward a secreted molecule , collective guidance may still function . however , new behaviors , such as cluster rotation , may also appear in this case . </S>",
    "<S> together , the combination of co - attraction and adaptation allows for collective guidance that is robust to varying chemoattractant concentrations while not requiring strong cell - cell adhesion . </S>"
