    "doubly charged scalar bosons sometimes play an important role in building models which explain neutrino masses and mixing .",
    "one of the representative scenarios is called type - ii seesaw mechanism  @xcite in which an isospin triplet scalar field @xmath4 is introduced .",
    "since @xmath4 has @xmath5 hypercharge @xmath6 , it contains an electrically neutral  ( @xmath7 ) , singly - charged  ( @xmath8 ) , and doubly charged  ( @xmath9 ) bosons , and directly couples to the isospin - doublet leptons at tree level via @xmath10 .",
    "the the neutrino mass matrix is induced after @xmath4 develops a vacuum expectation value  ( vev ) which violates the lepton number by two . to achieve the smallness of neutrino masses , the vev of @xmath4 or / and the yukawa couplings @xmath11 have to be small .",
    "interactions of @xmath12 and @xmath13 provide promising signals of doubly  ( singly ) charged bosons at collider experiments .",
    "notice here that these interactions are associated with leptons with left - handed chirality .",
    "another type of interaction is often employed in radiative seesaw models , such as the zee - babu model  @xcite , in which doubly ( singly ) charged scalar bosons , @xmath14 , are introduced as an isospin singlet .",
    "then @xmath15 directly couples to the isospin - singlet leptons at tree level via @xmath16 , which is also a source of lepton number violation by two unit .",
    "the neutrino mass matrix is generated at two - loop level via several terms related to the doubly  ( singly ) charged bosons after the electroweak symmetry breaking by the standard - model  ( sm ) higgs boson where we can naturally consider models with @xmath17 yukawa coupling and/or new particles whose masses are @xmath18  tev inside the loops .",
    "the interaction is associated with leptons with right - handed chirality in contrast to the type - ii seesaw scenario .",
    "these two types of yukawa interaction would also appear in many other neutrino mass models as a source of lepton number violation .",
    "thus it is important to analyze the interactions of doubly charged scalar bosons and charged leptons to discriminate models of neutrino mass generation  @xcite .",
    "searches for the doubly charged scalar bosons have been performed in the past and current collider experiments , and the most severe constraint is obtained by the same - sign di - lepton resonance searches at the lhc  @xcite . assuming a large branching ratio of a certain di - lepton channel , the lower bounds on the mass of doubly charged scalar bosons are set to about 400  gev to 600  gev depending on the models and the decay channels .",
    "the two bosons have also different interaction with the electroweak gauge bosons",
    ". namely the doubly charged scalar boson of triplet models can couple to a pair of charged gauge bosons , @xmath19 s , at tree level",
    ". the decay branching ratio to the same - sign @xmath20 can be large if the triplet vev is as large as @xmath21  mev depending on the mass itself .",
    "thus the search for such events provides an unique signature of the triplet model  @xcite .",
    "production of doubly charged scalar bosons via the @xmath20-fusion process is also expected in the triplet - like models , such as the georgi - machacek model  @xcite , which realize a large triplet vev to make the production cross section sizable  @xcite .    in this paper , we study the effects of the doubly charged scalar boson exchange in @xmath22 processes  @xcite at future lepton colliders .",
    "we consider the initial - state polarization to discriminate the two types of the interactions , and study the bounds of their masses and couplings probed at the future international linear collider  ( ilc ) experiment  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we discuss prospects of constraining model parameter space by combining the current and future constraints of lepton flavor violating  ( lfv ) processes as well as the constraints at the lep experiment  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss constraints from lfv processes . in sec .",
    "iii , we consider the effects of doubly charged scalar bosons to the @xmath22 processes at lepton colliders , and study the constraints on the mass and couplings of these bosons by using the forward - backward asymmetry . in sec .  iv we summarize the constraints and prospects of future bounds on the relevant effective couplings with numerical analysis .",
    "v is devoted for conclusions and discussions .",
    "we at first estimate bounds of lfv processes on the two representative terms , @xmath23 in higgs triplet models , and @xmath2 in zee - babu type models .",
    "we discuss the lfv processes in a higgs triplet model induced by following relevant lagrangian is replaced by @xmath24 in eq .",

    "these yukawa interactions induce lfv processes @xmath31 and @xmath32 at tree and one - loop levels , respectively , through virtual @xmath33 and @xmath8 mediations .",
    "then one obtains the constraints on the combination of @xmath11 and masses of @xmath8 and @xmath9 by comparing the measured branching ratios ( brs ) of these lfv processes and those of model predictions .",
    "table  [ tab : lfvconst1 ] summarizes the observed limit of the brs and the corresponding constraints for the three - body decay processes  @xcite , and table  [ tab : lfvconst2 ] summarizes the constraints from the upper limit of br for @xmath34 given by the recent meg experiment  @xcite , and from the upper limits of brs for @xmath35 , @xmath36 given by ref .",
