    "numerous studies have convincingly established that at z@xmath00.3 rich clusters of galaxies have a higher fraction of photometrically blue galaxies than is found in present - epoch clusters of similar richness ( e.g. , butcher & oemler 1978 , 1984 ; couch & newell 1984 ; macclaren 1988 ; dressler & gunn 1992 ; rakos & schombert 1995 ; belloni 1995 ) .",
    "in addition , follow - up spectroscopy ( e.g. , dressler & gunn 1982 , 1983 , 1992 ; lavery & henry 1986 ; henry & lavery 1987 ; couch & sharples 1987 ; soucail 1988 ; pickles & van der kruit 1991 ) has revealed that many galaxies in distant clusters exhibit strong emission lines , indicating either ongoing star formation or starburst ( sb ) activity , while others show strong balmer absorption lines with little or no emission , indicating either recently truncated star formation or poststarburst ( psb ) activity .",
    "the fraction of the strong balmer line galaxies which have experienced a major starburst as opposed to sudden truncation of star formation is a matter of current debate ( cf .",
    "barger 1996 ; balogh 1997 ; morris 1998 ) .",
    "recently , morphological studies carried out with the _ hubble space telescope _ have shown that a larger fraction of the star forming galaxies are classified as spiral , irregular , or interactions / mergers than in nearby clusters ( dressler 1994a,1994b ; couch 1994 ; wirth 1994 ; couch 1998 ) , a result that confirms the ground - based imaging studies of thompson ( 1988 ) , lavery & henry ( 1988 ) , and lavery ( 1992 ) .",
    "as mentioned above , at z=0 there are relatively few blue galaxies in rich clusters , i.e. , with b - v@xmath00.2 mags bluer than the c - m sequence of the red galaxies in the cluster ( e.g. , bower 1992 ) .",
    "furthermore , in present - epoch clusters only a small fraction of galaxies are classified as spirals , at least within the morphological framework that has been developed from mostly isolated nearby spirals .",
    "in fact , even those cluster galaxies classified as spirals are usually found to be depleted in hi content ( e.g. , haynes 1984 and references therein ; giovanelli & haynes 1985 ; gavazzi 1989 ) .",
    "nevertheless , recent work has indicated that the differences in evolutionary processes between nearby and distant rich clusters may not be as extreme as previously considered . moss & whittle ( 1993 ) and moss ( 1995 ) found that a higher fraction of spirals in nearby clusters that are morphologically classified as early type spirals show elevated , and centrally concentrated , star formation levels than in a field sample .",
    "gavazzi ( 1995 ) also found evidence for elevated star formation rates in cluster spirals .",
    "in addition , caldwell et al ( 1993 , 1996 ) and caldwell & rose ( 1997 , 1998 ) have shown that a substantial fraction of early - type galaxies ( i.e. , those morphologically classified as e or s0 ) in nearby rich clusters show signs of psb or sb activity .",
    "finally , koopmann & kenney ( 1998 ) have pointed out that in general spiral galaxies in clusters do not fit consistently within the morphological framework of isolated spirals .",
    "specifically , many cluster spirals with low disk star formation rates that would indicate early - type spiral morphologies in fact have concentrations of light typical of late type spirals .",
    "thus there may exist many late type spirals in clusters at low redshift which have such suppressed star formation rates in their disks ( due to the gas depletion processes present in rich clusters ) , that they are lumped together with early type spirals .    in short ,",
    "a perhaps more accurate picture of nearby clusters is that environmentally driven evolutionary processes in galaxies are still ongoing .",
    "these environmental processes may be qualitatively similar to those observed in distant clusters , although they are occurring at a reduced level in intensity and frequency .",
    "the reduced intensity in nearby clusters may be due in part to the depletion in hi reservoir in the general galaxy population since z=0.3 , due to star formation or other removal processes .",
    "more generally , the reduction in intensity and frequency has been discussed within the context of a hierarchical clustering scenario for structure formation by bower ( 1991 ) and kauffmann ( 1995 ) .    given that evolutionary processes in cluster galaxies , perhaps similar in nature to those occurring in distant clusters , are indeed ongoing at the present epoch , then the proximity of nearby rich clusters , such as coma , provides an excellent prospect for studying these processes in detail .",
    "in particular , the star formation bursts can be studied at high enough spatial resolution that their cause(s ) might be revealed .",
    "for example , how centrally concentrated are the starbursts ?",
    "are there any young star clusters , such as are found in merging galaxies ( e.g. , ngc 1275 , holtzmann 1992 ; ngc 7252 , miller 1997 ) .",
    "are there morphological peculiarities associated with the starbursts that can be unambiguously linked to tidal disturbances or other external triggering mechanisms ? and what are the morphological differences between sb and psb galaxies ? to that end , we have otained wfpc2 images with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) of a number of sb and psb galaxies in the coma and dc2048 - 52 nearby rich clusters .",
    "the morphological characteristics of these galaxies , as revealed by wfpc2 imaging , forms the subject of this paper . the characteristics of the _ hst _ images are described in  2 . in ",
    "3 the morphologies and inner luminosity and color profiles of the coma and dc2048 - 52 sb / psb galaxies are presented . in ",
    "4 we discuss which mechanism can best account for the sb / psb activity and morphological disturbances revealed by the _ hst _ images .",
    "before describing the _ hst _ wfpc2 images , we briefly summarize how our sample of nine galaxies was selected .",
    "we originally obtained multi - fiber spectroscopy for many galaxies in coma and dc2048 - 52 ( and in three other clusters ) which we believed to be early - type based on morphologies from ground - based images and/or colors ( caldwell 1993 ; caldwell & rose 1997 ) . for a substantial fraction ( typically @xmath115% ) of these galaxies the spectra indicate either current or recent star formation .",
    "the nine galaxies chosen were then selected from among those with spectroscopic evidence for unusual star formation histories .",
    "furthermore , they were chosen to cover a representative range of current and past star formation . finally , while in coma the sb / psb galaxies are primarily located in the sw region of the cluster , in the case of dc2048 - 52 they are much more uniformly spread over the main cluster and the northern subcluster .",
    "wfpc2 images were obtained in the b ( f450w filter ) and i ( f814w filter ) passbands with _ hst _ during cycle 6 for four fields in the coma cluster and three fields in dc2048 - 52 . in each case",
    "a sb or psb galaxy was centered in the pc frame , except in the case of one field in coma , where both the psb galaxy dressler 99 and the sb galaxy dressler 100 were included on a single pc frame .",
    "two 600 second exposures were obtained for each galaxy in the f450w filter , and two 400 second exposures in the f814w filter .",
    "the images were processed using the standard _ hst",
    "_ pipeline routines . to remove cosmic rays , the pairs of exposures were coadded using the ` gcombine ' routine in iraf / stsdas with the ` crreject ' option .",
    "in addition , images of the psb galaxy dressler 216 in coma were extracted from the _ hst _ archive . in this case , the galaxy is located on one of the wf chips , and the passbands are v ( f555w ) and i ( f814 ) .",
    "there are seven 900 second exposures in v and eight 900 second exposures in i. the same processing steps were used for these images .",
    "radial light profiles in both colors were extracted for these galaxies using a program that fits elliptical isophotes ( caldwell & rose 1997 ) .",
    "the elliptical isophotes were found on the i filter image ; intensity data falling on these ellipses were then collected from the bluer image ( b or v ) , after adjusting for a change in center .",
    "calibrations for the f450w , f555w , and f814w frames were those provided in holtzmann ( 1995 ) .",
    "error estimates in the surface brightnesses , magnitudes , and colors were calculated from the photon statistics , the readout noise , and the error in determining the mean sky .",
    "color profiles were found by subtracting the surface brightness profiles of the two filters .",
    "no attempt at matching the point - spread functions of the two filters was made .",
    "the mean color quoted in table [ tab1 ] refers to the integrated color within the radius where the i surface brightness falls to 23 mag arcsec@xmath2 . for reference ,",
    "normal luminous elliptical galaxies have b - i@xmath12.3 .",
    "in addition to the _ hst _ images , ground - based images for eight of the nine galaxies have been obtained , either with the 1.2-m telescope of the f. l. whipple observatory for the coma galaxies or with the ctio 0.9-m telescope for the dc2048 - 52 galaxies .",
    "the characteristics of these ground - based images are given in caldwell ( 1993 ) and caldwell & rose ( 1997 ) .",

    "was originally determined from multi - fiber spectroscopy with either the hydra spectrograph on the kpno 4-m ( for coma ) or the argus spectrograph on the ctio 4-m ( for dc2048 - 52 ) .",
    "the one exception is dressler 61 in coma , for which the psb nature was determined from a spectrum obtained with the mmt .",
    "all of these observations are described in caldwell ( 1993 ) and caldwell & rose ( 1997 ) .",
    "in addition , the sb or psb nature was shown to be centrally concentrated , although spatially extended , from follow - up long - slit spectroscopy of coma galaxies described in caldwell & rose ( 1996 ) .",
    "for d61 in coma , an additional spectrum was obtained with the 1.5-m telescope of the f. l. whipple observatory and fast spectograph ( fabricant 1998 ) at 1.5  / pixel and covering the wavelength region @xmath3@xmath33635 - 7585  .",
    "these spectroscopic observations are referred to in  3 below , where the properties of the nine sb / psb galaxies are summarized .",
    "the morphologies and luminosity profiles of the sb and psb galaxies for which we have hst images are quite diverse . as a result",
    ", we begin with an individual discussion of each galaxy , and in  4 draw general conclusions about the starburst nature of these galaxies . for convenience of organization",

    "hence the multi - fiber spectra , which cover 3 in diameter on the coma cluster galaxies and 2diameter on the galaxies in dc2048 - 52 , provide integrated spectra of typically the central @xmath12 - 3 kpc in diameter of these galaxies .      _",

    "the long - slit spectrum of coma - d99 from caldwell ( 1996 ) was oriented at a position angle of 121@xmath10 e of n , in order to pass through the center of coma - d100 as well .",

    "we have applied the ca ii h + h@xmath12 versus h@xmath13/fe i age dating technique that was developed in leonardi & rose ( 1996 ) and applied to other coma cluster psb galaxies in caldwell ( 1996 ) and caldwell & rose ( 1998 ) .",
    "this technique , which decouples the mostly degenerate effects of psb age from burst strength ( for a fading burst superposed on an underlying `` old '' galaxy ) , relies on the high sensitivity of the relative strength of h@xmath12 versus the ca ii h and k lines to the contribution from a stars . using this age dating method",

    "at this point we can summarize our knowledge of the sb and psb galaxies in nearby clusters as follows . from ground - based multi - fiber and long - slit spectroscopy",
    "we have found that some galaxies , which from ground - based images are classified as early - type galaxies , have signs of unusual star formation histories , both in terms of the star formation being elevated in the recent past and that star formation being centrally concentrated .",
    "the ground - based images indicate that all of these galaxies are disk galaxies . from the hst images , we find that the sb galaxies have spiral structure . in some cases ( coma - d15 ) the spiral structure",
    "is restricted to the inner couple of kpc , while in others ( coma - d45 and coma - d100 ) it is global , but in all cases the star formation is centrally concentrated .",
    "most of the psb galaxies have smooth morphologies , perhaps because their time since the cessation of the starbursts is already @xmath11 gyr ( caldwell et al . 1996 ) .",
    "however one psb galaxy ( coma - d61 ) exhibits an x - shaped bulge , which is interesting since the starburst age of this galaxy is relatively young , at @xmath10.5 gyr .",
    "none of the observed galaxies show large collections of young star clusters such as are seen in some merger products ( holtzmann 1992 , miller 1997 ) , which may be an indication that major mergers are not the mechanism involved here .",
    "the two late - type spiral galaxies are a cause for uncertainty .",
    "these might be related to anemic galaxies , in which a starburst has not actually occured ; rather , the normal disk star formation in such galaxies has been truncated .",
    "more detailed spectroscopy than is currently available is needed to sort out this problem .",
    "although only nine sb / psb have been studied so far , it seems reasonable to propose an evolutionary sequence , for example , from coma - d15 to coma - d61 to coma - d99 .",
    "thus the starburst which is centrally located but extended would eventually fade , resulting in a galaxy with smoother appearance , but with spectroscopic evidence for the past starburst .",
    "we caution that precursors might well have a large range in morphologies , and thus the resultants might also have a range in appearances .",
    "the central issue we now address is what these observed morphologies allow us to conclude about the source of the sb / psb activity in nearby rich clusters .",
    "the mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the rapid evolution in galaxies taking place in distant clusters tend to fall into two basic categories : external gravitational perturbation of some kind , ( e.g. , tidal interaction or merging ) or a gas removal mechanism ( e.g. , ram pressure stripping or ablation ) .",
    "ram pressure stripping is undoubtedly an important factor in the evolution of cluster galaxies , and probably plays a major role in the observed hi depletion of spiral disks ( e.g. , gunn & gott 1972 ; cowie & songaila 1977 ; dressler 1985 ) .",
    "however , given the central concentration of the star formation and the non - axisymmetric morphologies present in some cases , which are difficult to understand in terms of a `` continuous '' gas removal process , we naturally tend to consider the external gravitational perturbation mechanism as the more likely of the two possibilities as a source of the observed central star formation .",
    "such a perturbation could arise from a single strong tidal interaction and/or merger from either an equal mass perturber or a minor mass galaxy .",
    "alternatively , the tidal perturbation could be produced by the global cluster gravitational potential ( byrd & valtonen 1990 ; valluri 1993 ; henriksen & byrd 1996 ) , or , in the case of `` galaxy harassment '' , from the combined effects of many discrete minor disturbances and of the global cluster potential ( moore 1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "we first consider strong tidal interactions and/or mergers of equal mass galaxies .",
    "observations of galaxies in distant clusters have revealed the signatures of major encounters / mergers in the form of long tidal tails in a substantial number of cases ( e.g. , lavery & henry 1988 ; couch 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "these signatures can be taken as evidence for such mergers , although not all the observed cases are clearly due to mergers ( couch 1998 ) . however , among the sb / psb galaxies that we have imaged in nearby clusters , there are no signs of such major interactions / mergers ; we find no cases where long tidal tails are evident , nor do we find signs of a major companion with similar radial velocity . in the three sb / psb cases where nearby `` companions '' do appear to be present , two `` companions '' have in fact very different velocities .",
    "coma - d99 and coma - d100 have a radial velocity difference of 4700 km / sec and ( 2 ) the nearby `` companion '' to coma - d15 is a background galaxy with z=0.127 . in the third case , dc2048-d216 , the `` companion '' has no measured redshift , but that galaxy itself is a normal looking late - type spiral , with no indication of tidal interactions . as well , dc2048-d216 has a smooth appearance indicating that a significant time has elapsed since the putative tidal iteraction would have occured .",
    "thus we do not consider strong tidal interactions or mergers between equal mass galaxies to be the primary mechanism for inducing starbursts in the nearby rich clusters .",
    "mergers between a galaxy and a low - mass companion ( hereafter referred to as a minor merger ) provide a more promising prospect .",
    "mihos & hernquist ( 1994 ) and hernquist & mihos ( 1995 ) have carried out numerical simulations of minor mergers which include gas dynamics and star formation .",
    "a key result of their simulations is that gas in the main galaxy loses angular momentum due to torques exerted by non - axisymmetric disturbances in the stellar component which are generated by the tidal passage and infall of the satellite galaxy . as a result , a great deal of gas piles up in the central region of the main galaxy , leading to a burst of star formation there .",
    "the central concentration of the star formation and the magnitude and duration of the star formation burst depend on the bulge - to - disk ratio of the main galaxy .",
    "however , in general the star formation is concentrated within the central @xmath11 kpc of the main galaxy , and the starburst lasts for typically @xmath1100  150 myr ( mihos & hernquist 1994 ) .",
    "some of their simulations bear a striking resemblance to d100 and d15 in coma .",
    "specifically , in fig .",
    "4 ( for simulation of the gas ) and fig .",
    "3 ( for simulation of the stars ) of hernquist & mihos ( 1995 ) , at a time step of 43.2 the main galaxy looks very similar to d100 . at time steps greater than 80 , there is considerable resemblance to d15 . in addition , both whitmore & bell ( 1988 ) and mihos et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have discussed x shapes in the bulges of galaxies and have proposed that they are produced by the disturbance created when a minor merger takes place .",
    "the mihos et al .",
    "( 1995 ) simulation of a minor merger viewed edge - on ( see their fig .",
    "3 ) is a close match to our _ hst _ image of d61 in coma . finally , as can be seen from the edge - on views of minor merger simulations published in fig . 3 of hernquist & mihos ( 1995 ) , minor mergers heat the disk of the main galaxy , but do not lead to its disruption , which is in agreement with the fact that the psb galaxies in coma and dc2048 - 52 still exhibit surviving disks .",
    "given that the minor merger simulations of mihos & hernquist are capable of generating the kind of morphological signatures and central star formation that characterize some of our _ hst _ images , we evaluated the possibility that minor mergers are the _ primary _ source of the star forming early - type galaxies in nearby clusters .",
    "specifically , we are interested in reproducing the situation in the sw region of the coma cluster , where many psb galaxies were found by caldwell ( 1993 ) , a spatial / kinematic subcluster has been clearly identified ( colless & dunn 1996 ; biviano 1996 ) , and a secondary peak in the cluster x - ray emission has been discovered ( watt 1992 ; briel 1992 ; white 1993 ) .",
    "while there is much current debate concerning whether this subcluster , with its associated x - ray and starburst phenomena , is currently falling into the main coma cluster or has already passed through ( e.g. , burns 1994 ; colless & dunn 1996 ) , for the purposes of this discussion we will assume the latter case .",
    "thus we speculate that the starbursts in the coma psb galaxies were triggered by minor mergers which occurred when the subcluster encountered the numerous small galaxies in the central part of the coma cluster .",
    "we tested this hypothesis by running n - body simulations of colliding clusters of galaxies using the publicly available nemo stellar dynamical software ( teuben 1995 ) .",
    "the simulations are similar to those described in caldwell & rose ( 1997 ) , in which the evolution of a subcluster falling into a main cluster is followed .",
    "as before , we are only concerned with the gravitational interactions of the particles , so the hydrodynamics of the icm are not considered . a detailed description of the simulations , and of how we identified the minor merger events , is given in the appendix .",
    "the results of the simulations , which are also described in the appendix and summarized in table a.1 , show that the frequency of minor mergers is far too low to explain the large fraction of sb / psb galaxies in the sw region of coma .      as mentioned earlier ,",
    "an alternative way to produce morphological disturbances in cluster galaxies through external gravitational influence is via the `` galaxy harassment '' mechanism of moore ( 1996 , 1998 ) . here",
    "the combined effects of frequent impulsive perturbations from small galaxies in high - speed encounters and the changing global tidal field of the cluster produce similar disturbances to the minor merger scenario . given",
    "that harassment is a continual process for any cluster galaxy , we can expect that the morphological and star formation signatures of the harassment process should be evident in those galaxies which still have disks containing significant amounts of hi .",
    "thus galaxies in subclusters which are infalling for the first time into main clusters , and hence have not yet ( completely ) lost their gas supply in the hostile cluster environment , are good candidates to produce visible reaction to the harassment process .",
    "in fact , fujita ( 1998 ) has recently shown from a simple model of pressure - enhanced star formation that galaxy harassment does indeed lead to elevated rates of star formation .",
    "in short , galaxy harassment could provide a natural explanation for the appearance of the many sb / psb galaxies in the sw region of coma , where the ngc 4839 subcluster appears to be interacting with the main cluster .",
    "of course , one can also expect to see isolated examples of harassed galaxies , since any disk galaxy with a gas supply that is falling into the cluster can in principle go through the evolutionary stages that appear to be present among the sb and psb galaxies in coma and dc2048 - 52 .",
    "several questions remain about the applicability of galaxy harassment to the sb / psb galaxies in nearby clusters .",
    "this process has been used to primarily describe the evolution of the small galaxies in clusters , whereas the coma and dc2048 - 52 galaxies that we have imaged are quite substantial , typically only a magnitude fainter than l*. it is important to evaluate the process for these more massive galaxies , with particular regard to the end state produced .",
    "specifically , our hst images and ground - based images indicate that the psb galaxies still have a prominent disk , thus observationally the disks do survive the perturbation .",
    "but do simulated harassed disks survive ? as well , the hst images indicate that the morphologies of the sb / psb galaxies are quite heterogeneous , indicating that a range in precursor morphologies are being processed into a still considerable range in resultant morphologies .",
    "it is important to simulate the effect of harassment on a reasonably wide range of input disk morphologies .",
    "the effect of harassment on a wide range of initial disk luminosity ( mass ) must be considered as well . in caldwell & rose ( 1998 ) we found two low - luminosity ( b@xmath20 ) coma galaxies in a recent psb state .",
    "they are clearly s0 s , as indicated by their light profiles , hence harassment must not in general lead to the destruction of disks in smaller galaxies if it is to explain these small galaxies in coma .",
    "finally , can harassment produce the x morphology that is so evident in coma - d61 ?",
    "to summarize , _ hst",
    "_ wfpc2 images of nine sb / psb galaxies in the coma and dc2048 - 52 nearby rich clusters have revealed that the morphologies of the galaxies are rather heterogeneous .",
    "however , the sb galaxies tend to have ongoing highly centralized star formation in a region typically @xmath11 - 2 kpc in radius that appears as a bright `` bulge '' on ground - based images . in contrast",
    ", the psb galaxies for the most part have substantially smoother morphologies than their sb counterparts , but with blue colors in their central @xmath11 - 2 kpc in radius .",
    "these findings , coupled with the ground - based spectrosocpy reported in earlier papers , are generally consistent with a picture in which the sb galaxies are presently experiencing enhanced star formation in their central regions , and ultimately will fade into the the smoother morphologies represented by the psb galaxies , with lingering evidence for past central starbursts . while the sample of nine galaxies is still small for drawing general conclusions about the mechanism that triggers the starbursts , in several galaxies we see evidence for an external tidal perturbation as the likely cause of the centralized starburst .",
    "perhaps the `` galaxy harassment '' mechanism of moore ( 1996 ) is capable of providing such tidal perturbations .",
    "the fact that some galaxies in nearby clusters appear to be normal s0 s or ellipticals on ground - based images , but with the increased spatial resolution of _ hst _ are revealed to have centrally concentrated recent or ongoing star formation , has implications for morphological studies of distant galaxies . in the typical z@xmath10.4 cluster",
    "for which _ hst _ images can now provide comparable physical resolution as ground - based images of coma cluster galaxies , one may now question whether some galaxies classified as early - type from _ hst _ images actually harbor ongoing or recent starbursts in their central regions .    finally , to establish a clearer picture of how a galaxy is excited into a starburst and then fades through the psb phase into a `` normal '' early - type galaxy , we need to increase the sample of sb / psb galaxies beyond the nine observed for this paper to several dozen .",
    "a larger sample is particularly necessary if we are to assess how evolution through the sb and psb phase depends on the initial morphology of the precursor galaxy .",
    "such information would establish an observational framework for testing the effects of tidal perturbations on galaxies within the dense cluster environment .",

    "the numerical simulations used in  4.2.1 to assess the frequency of minor mergers in clusters were carried out using the routine `` hackcode1 '' , which is the standard nemo n - body integrator based on the barnes & hut ( 1989 ) hierarchial tree algorithm .",
    "the nemo stellar dynamical software is publicly available on the world wide web . because we would like to compare the simulations to our observations , it is important to know to what physical units the nemo units correspond .",
    "the nemo units are defined as follows : 1 ) the gravitational potential of each cluster is @xmath21 , 2 ) the kinetic energy is @xmath22 ( therefore the cluster is virialized ) , 3 ) the total mass of the cluster is @xmath23 and 4 ) the gravitational constant is @xmath24 . noting that @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the gravitational radius , we find that @xmath27 , and from the kinetic energy requirements , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the rms velocity dispersion of the galaxies . observations of the x - ray gas ( fusco - femiano & hughes 1994 ) and of the galaxy distribution ( kent & gunn 1982 ) show that the core radius of coma is @xmath30 kpc and @xmath31 kpc respectively . using the fact that for a plummer model ( which we adopt here for its mathematical convenience ) , @xmath32 and an estimated distance to the coma cluster of 100 mpc , we find an average @xmath26 on the order of 1 mpc implying that a nemo unit of distance is 500 kpc .",
    "the inferred 3-dimensional rms velocity dispersion for coma is approximately 1700 km / s ( colless & dunn 1996 ; biviano et al 1996 ) implying that a nemo unit of velocity is 2404 km / s . a unit of time in nemo is defined as 0.4 crossing time , which , for the coma cluster with a crossing time of 1 gyr , corresponds to 0.4 gyr .    in general , the simulations consisted of two clusters : a main cluster with @xmath15000 particles and a less massive subcluster with 256 particles .",
    "the point of the simulations was to assess how large a fraction of the galaxies in the infalling subcluster would experience a minor merger with one of the small galaxies in the main cluster .",
    "the mihos & hernquist ( 1994 ) and hernquist & mihos ( 1995 ) simulations used a mass ratio between large galaxy and satellite galaxy of 10:1 . while it is not entirely clear what is the minimum mass ratio that can still produce a large tidal effect on the larger galaxy , we adopted a ratio of 20:1 as a reasonable estimate .",
    "consequently , our simulations are designed to look for minor mergers between `` large '' galaxies in the subcluster and `` small '' galaxies in the main cluster . given that the typical psb galaxy in the sw region of the coma cluster has b = 16.5 , we expect the typical minor merger to be with a main cluster galaxy with b = 19.75 . from recent analyses of the coma cluster luminosity function",
    "( bernstein 1995 ; lobo 1997 ; secker 1997 ) we estimate there to be approximately 1200 galaxies with b @xmath33 19.75 . hence in simulating the coma cluster with @xmath15000 particles we overestimate the frequency of minor mergers by a factor of approximately 4 .",
    "however , by using such a large number of particles in both cluster and subcluster we obtain better statistics on the merger frequency and then can adjust the merger rates accordingly .    in our simulations each cluster",
    "was constructed from a virialized plummer model with a softening parameter for each particle of 0.05 nemo units ( equivalent to 25 kpc ) to account for the extended mass distributions of the individual galaxies .",
    "the two structures were initially placed 4 distance units apart with a variety of purely radial subcluster infall velocities ranging from 1/4 parabolic to 1/16 parabolic . in most cases , the mass ratio of the two clusters was 4:1 .",
    "the subcluster was constructed of only one type of particle each with a mass of @xmath34x@xmath35 nemo mass units , so that the total mass of the subcluster was 1 . for the main cluster we used 5120 particles each with a mass of @xmath36x@xmath37 , i.e.",
    ", approximately 20 times less massive than the particles in the subcluster . then to bring the total mass of the main cluster to four times larger than the subcluster , we inserted 100 particles each of mass @xmath38x@xmath39 .",
    "all simulations were run for 10 time units ( i.e. 4 gyr total ) with 15 increments per each 0.4 gyr time unit . at times near 4.5 , the subcluster is just passing through the center of the main cluster and at times near 9 , the subcluster has almost halted and is about to fall back into the main cluster for the second time . because we are only interested in the first passage of the subcluster",
    ", the simulations were not continued beyond this point . to increase the statistical reliability of the results",
    ", we ran each simulation four times , with different random initial positions and velocities for the individual particles within the two virialized plummer models .    for each iteration , nemo outputs the mass , the x - y - z spatial coordinates and the x - y - z velocity coordinates of each particle .",
    "the particle data is then analyzed to determine if a minor merger has taken place .",
    "the specific conditions under which galaxy mergers occur are still somewhat uncertain .",
    "analytical work carried out under the impulsive approximation ( e.g. , alladin 1965 ; alladin 1975 ; white 1982 and references therein ) have indicated that tidal interactions will dissipate sufficient orbital energy to effect capture if the original encounter velocity between the two galaxies is slightly hyperbolic or less . more specifically , the energy dissipation from tidal interaction scales as : @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the velocity and distance separation of the two galaxies at closest approach ( spitzer 1958 ; alladin 1975 ; white 1982 ) . in more general terms ,",
    "white ( 1982 ) concluded that if a pair of equal mass galaxies have a relative velocity and impact parameter at infinity given by @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and with relative velocity @xmath41 and distance @xmath42 at closest approach , then merging will occur for @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath26 are the rms velocity dispersion and gravitational radius ( as defined through the virial theorem ) of each galaxy .",
    "the encounter parameters at infinity and at closest approach are related by @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the mass of each galaxy . for the specific case of a pair of galaxies with @xmath47 = 180 and m = 10@xmath51 ,",
    "the maximum relative velocity at infinity that can result in a merger is then @xmath43 = 255 , and for a closest approach of @xmath42 = 25 kpc , the orbital kinetic energy term @xmath52 is approximately twice the gravitational potential energy term @xmath53 , since @xmath54 .",
    "hence , it appears that as a general rule a merger will occur if the oribital kinetic energy at closest approach is less than twice the orbital potential energy .",
    "this is clearly a very crude approximation , given that the actual tidal encounter is dependent on the mass distribution within the galaxies and their internal kinematics ( e.g. , elliptical versus disk galaxy ) and the angle of encounter .",
    "unfortunately , the above assumption of an impulsive encounter is actually invalid in the slow encounters that lead to a merger .",
    "however , numerical simulations ( e.g. , toomre 1977 ; white 1982 ) have tended to confirm the general results obtained from the above analytic approximations . as a specific case , in the hernquist & mihos ( 1995 ) simulations",
    "a minor merger was achieved when the satellite galaxy was initially placed at 6 disk scale lengths from the large galaxy , or @xmath120  25 kpc for a major disk galaxy like the milky way ( e.g. , mihalas & binney 1981 ) .",
    "we therefore adopt as the first criterion for a minor merger that the two galaxies must come within 25 kpc ( or 0.05 nemo distance units ) of each other . for our second criterion ,",
    "i.e. , that the galaxies must have a relatively slow encounter speed , we specify that the encounter velocity at closest approach must be low enough that the orbital kinetic energy of the main galaxy plus satellite be less than twice the gravitational potential energy , i.e. , the constraint developed above from the impulsive approximation studies .",
    "finally , since we are interested in the frequency of minor mergers , the third criterion is that the encounter must take place between an infalling subcluster member and a low mass particle in the main cluster .",
    "the general results of the n - body simulations are that typically less than 2% of the subcluster galaxies experience a minor merger . given that we overestimated the number of small galaxies in coma by more than a factor of 4",
    ", we thus predict that only 0.5% of the galaxies in a merging subcluster would experience a minor merger .",
    "in contrast , @xmath140% of the early - type galaxies in the sw region of coma are either sb or psb ( caldwell et al 1993 )",
    ". furthermore , those mergers that do take place in our simulations are almost exclusively among particles in the subcluster that are stripped off during the subcluster passage and thus remain behind with the main cluster .",
    "as was discussed in caldwell & rose ( 1997 ) , about 60% of the subcluster particles become bound to the main cluster during the subcluster passage .",
    "it is among these particles that the minor mergers occur in our simulations .",
    "moreover , roughly 85% of the observed mergers take place between times 6 and 9 , i.e. , at late times .",
    "what is clearly happening is that some of the particles left behind in the main cluster eventually experience a minor merger , which has little to do with the initial pasage of the subcluster through the main cluster .",
    "this is not what is seen in the case of the sw region of coma , where the sb / psb galaxies are associated both spatially and kinematically ( in the mean ) with the subcluster .",
    "in addition , the age dating of the psb galaxies indicates that they underwent starbursts within a fairly narrow time frame , thus implying that the starbursts were triggered in a well - defined event , such as passage of the subcluster through the main cluster .    to further test these results , we changed the merger distance criterion from 25 kpc to 50 kpc .",
    "while the number of minor mergers did increase with this change , the number only doubled to about 4% , with the mergers occuring in the same location ( i.e. , in the main cluster center ) and at the same times .",
    "it may seem puzzling that the number of mergers did not quadruple when the distance was doubled , as might be expected since the cross sectional area goes as the square of the distance .",
    "however , one must consider the energy criterion as well .",
    "for a galaxy to satisfy both the distance and the energy requirements after the distance criterion is doubled , it must initially have a smaller velocity so that it still meets the energy condition at closest approach .    for completeness",
    ", we also tested the effects of changing the energy criterion so that the kinetic energy of the particles at closest approach must be less than 2.5 times the gravitational potential energy , as opposed to the factor of 2 previously considered . even under these conditions",
    ", the number of minor mergers that occured was only near 3% .",
    "likewise , there was no significant increase in the number of minor mergers when the infall parameters were changed .",
    "thus , from our n - body simulations , it seems very unlikely that minor mergers are the main source of the star formation in the early type galaxies in nearby clusters .",
    "a summary of the results of the simulations is given in table a.1 .",

    "<S> _ hst _ wfpc2 images in b ( f450w ) and i ( f814w ) have been obtained for three starburst ( sb ) and two post - starburst ( psb ) galaxies in the coma cluster , and for three such galaxies in the cluster dc2048 - 52 . </S>",
    "<S> v ( f555w ) and i images for an additional psb galaxy in coma have been extracted from the _ hst _ archive . </S>",
    "<S> seven of these galaxies were previously classified as e / s0 on the basis of ground - based images , one as sa , and the other as an irregular .    </S>",
    "<S> the _ hst _ images reveal these sb / psb galaxies to be heterogeneous in morphology . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless a common theme is that many of them , especially the sb galaxies , tend to have centralized spiral structure that appears simply as a bright `` bulge''on ground - based images . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , while some psb galaxies exhibit distinct spiral structure , on the whole they have smoother morphologies than the sb galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the morphologies and luminosity profiles are generally consistent with substantial starbursts in the form of centralized spiral structure ( the sb galaxies ) which fade into smoother morphologies ( the psb galaxies ) , with lingering spectroscopic evidence for past central starbursts . </S>",
    "<S> an important point is that the psb galaxies retain disks , i.e , they have not evolved into spheroidal systems .    </S>",
    "<S> while the morphologies revealed in the _ hst _ images are heterogeneous , and thus may not fit well into a single picture , we see evidence in several cases that the morphologies and centralized star formation have been driven by external tidal perturbations . we discuss several physical mechanisms for inducing star formation in cluster galaxies with a view towards explaining the particular morphologies seen in the _ hst _ images . </S>"
