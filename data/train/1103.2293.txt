    "* a lingering question related to star formation is whether stars in associations and young stellar groups originate in clusters that dissolve shortly ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , or are directly formed throughout the parent molecular cloud . at the bottom of this issue lies the scenario in which star formation is scale - free and hierarchical , with high velocity turbulent gas forming large - scale structures and small clumps being formed by low - velocity compression ( @xcite ) . in this context ,",
    "young stellar groupings would be hierarchically clustered , with the great star complexes at the largest scales and the ob associations and subgroups , clusters and cluster sub - clumps at the smallest ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "*    hierarchical patterns in extended structures have been detected in the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) and other nearby galaxies ( e.g. @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "at the few parsec scale , hubble space telescope ( hst ) and vlt - isaac photometry of pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars in the smc star - forming region ngc346/n66 suggest hierarchical star formation , probably originated from more than one event ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these works show that part of the pms stars are found in sub - clusters ( some located in the central region of the association and others at the border ) , with the remaining stars scattered around the association , a scenario directly related to the single or sequential star formation issue .",
    "recently , our group studied the stellar content of the sh2 - 132 hii region , a star - forming complex hosting at least 4 embedded clusters ( ecs ) and presenting evidence of triggered star formation and hierarchical structuring ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , given its rather large distance ( @xmath9kpc ) and the 2mass photometric depth , we could only sample a fraction of the pms population .",
    "thus , the present paper focuses on the nearby hii region ngc2174 ( sh2 - 252 ) and related ecs .",
    "this complex is located in the orion constellation and appears to be physically related to the gemob1 association ( @xmath10kpc , @xcite ) , together with several other sharpless hii regions and the supernova remnant ic443 ( see @xcite for a discussion of the objects in the area ) .",
    "star cluster studies in this region are rather scarce and not uniform , presenting very different values of distance and age , to the point that no physical relation among the clusters and the complex appears to exist ( sect .",

    "[ 2mass ] ) . according to our approach",
    ", the cluster centre corresponds to the coordinates that produce the smoothest stellar radial density profile ( rdp ) and , at the same time , the highest stellar density in the innermost region ( sect .",
    "[ struc ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows that the hii region ngc2174 ( and related objects ) still retain part of the parent gas and dust .    *",
    "thus , we employ the 2mass , , and   photometry to probe the photometric properties with an adequate depth , especially at the faint stellar sequences .",
    "additionally , 2mass provides the spatial and photometric uniformity required for wide extractions and high star - count statistics .",
    "the photometry for each target ( table  [ tab1 ] ) was extracted from vizier , and only stars with errors lower than 0.1mag are used . *    clusters that contain important fractions of faint stars and/or are projected near the galactic equator , require field - star decontamination for the proper identification and characterisation of the member stars .",
    "although projected towards the galactic anti - centre , the present clusters are found near the plane , having cmds dominated by pms stars ( see below ) .",
    "thus , we apply the decontamination algorithm first developed in @xcite and improved in @xcite to minimise confusion with red dwarfs of the galactic field .",
    "representative cmds of the targets are shown in the top panels of figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] . for ngc2175 , we first consider a region of radius @xmath68 , which is located outside the borders of the neighbouring sh2 - 252c and sh2 - 252e ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) and , thus , is expected to be free from contamination by stars of both objects ; a wider region will be considered in sect .",
    "[ n2175 ] .",
    "an indication of a young age comes from a comparison with the cmds extracted from equal - area offset fields ( middle panels ) , which is consistent with the presence of gas and dust ( figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "indeed , the decontaminated cmds ( bottom panels of figs .  [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] ) present similar features : they are essentially characterised by stellar sequences of mildly reddened , young clusters , with a nearly - vertical , developing ms and a significant population of pms stars .",
    "given the time - scales associated with stellar formation ( @xmath69yr for low - mass stars ) , very young clusters are expected to contain a population of pms stars ( e.g. @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "thus , the assumption that the red and faint stars belong to the pms is consistent with the @xmath1myr of age of the ecs in the complex ( sect .",
    "[ n2175 ] ) .",
    "internal differential reddening is implied by the colour distribution at faint magnitudes ( @xmath70 ) , which is wider than the spread predicted purely by pms models .",
    "a comparison with the reddening vector ( for @xmath71 ) shows different degrees of differential reddening , being lower for ngc2175s and teu136 , and higher for the remaining cases .",
    "if most of the colour spread is due to non - uniform reddening - and not to systematic differences in the stellar content - the upper limit to the differential reddening would be @xmath72mag .",
    "* probable member stars of each cluster are selected by a colour - magnitude filter , which is wide enough to include ms and pms stars , the photometric uncertainties , and binaries ( figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] ) ; they are used to build the projected stellar radial density profile ( rdp ) around the cluster centre . * as discussed elsewhere ( e.g. @xcite , and references therein ) , this filtering enhances the rdp contrast relative to the background , especially in crowded fields ( e.g. @xcite ) .    both sets of rdps ( before and after applying the colour - magnitude filters ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , where the contrast enhancement due to the filtering is clearly seen . except for ngc2175 ,",
    "the remaining rdps are typical of star clusters projected on a stellar fore / background : they follow a power - law ( on a log - log scale ) with a core near the centre , usually with fluctuations due to neighbouring clusters and/or stellar concentrations . * indeed , the rdps are well represented by the king - like ( @xcite ) function @xmath73 , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the central and residual stellar densities , and  is the core radius .",
    "*    we also use the rdps to estimate the cluster radius ( ) , taken as the distance from the cluster centre where the rdp and field fluctuations are statistically indistinguishable ( e.g. @xcite ) . in this sense ,  is an observational truncation radius , whose value depends both on the radial distribution of member stars and the field density .",
    "the rdp fits ( and uncertainties ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , and the corresponding structural parameters are given in table  [ tab3 ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table notes .",
    "col .  2 : effective mass range of the ms .",
    "col .  9 : average mass density .    as anticipated by the cmds ( figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] ) and the small sizes ( table  [ tab3 ] ) , we are dealing with low - mass clusters ( @xmath76 ) having poorly - populated mss and with most ( @xmath5 ) of the stars still in the pms . indeed , the mass stored in the pms stars is the dominant ( @xmath77 to @xmath78 ) component of the detected cluster mass , which is consistent with the young ages .",
    "however , given the presence of dust and gas ( figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) , differential reddening , and the 2mass photometric limitation ( which precludes detection of very - low mass pms stars ) , the mass values may be somewhat higher than quoted in table  [ tab4 ] .",
    "previous works on the hii region ngc2174 ( sh2 - 252 ) came up with discrepant values for the age and distance from the sun of the deeply - embedded star clusters ( and candidates ) in the area , to the point that no physical relation among them - and the complex - could have been inferred .",
    "we investigate the above issue with field - star decontaminated 2mass photometry ( to enhance cmd evolutionary sequences ) and stellar rdps , to derive fundamental and structural parameters of the 5 previously catalogued embedded clusters ( sh2 - 252a , c , e , ngc2175s , and teu136 ) and one candidate ( ngc2175 ) .",
    "the decontaminated cmds are characterised by similar properties : a poorly - populated and developing ms , a dominant fraction ( @xmath5 in number ) of pms stars , a similar foreground absorption , @xmath2mag , and some differential reddening . taken together ,",
    "the presence of gas , dust , some ov and bv stars , and the ms@xmath51pms cmd morphologies consistently constrain the age of the ecs ( and the extended stellar group ) to less than @xmath79myr ( the bulk of the stars are probably @xmath1myr old ) , with a time - spread of @xmath80myr for the star formation .",
    "the ms@xmath51pms stellar masses are low , within @xmath81 to @xmath82 . within the uncertainties , the distances from the sun of sh2 - 252a ,",
    "c , e , ngc2175s , and ngc2175 are essentially the same , @xmath83kpc , which agrees with that estimated for the physically - related association gemob1 .",
    "teu136 appears to be slightly more distant ( @xmath84kpc ) and reddened ( @xmath85mag ) than the other objects .",
    "since teu136 is beyond the north - east border of ngc2174 , it may be just an ec projected near the hii region .",
    "the decontaminated wide - field cmd of ngc2174 , which is expected to reflect the average properties of the stars in the region , provides the distance @xmath86kpc and the foreground absorption @xmath87 .",
    "the stellar rdps of sh2 - 252a , c , e , ngc2175s , and teu136 follow a king - like function characterised by small core and cluster radii , with @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively .",
    "ngc2175 , on the other hand , is not a cluster , and its stars probably originated on the same star - formation event that gave rise to the ecs .",
    "thus , ngc2175 may be classified as a young stellar group .    what can be concluded from our uniform , near - infrared approach ,",
    "is that ngc2174 and its related ecs ( sh2 - 252a , c , e , ngc2175s , and perhaps , teu136 ) are part of a single star - forming complex located at @xmath90kpc from the sun .",
    "thus , we are dealing with a coeval ( to within @xmath8myr ) star - forming event that extended for @xmath80myr .",
    "besides the scattered stars of ngc2175 ( probably an off - cluster star formation in the molecular cloud ) , the event gave rise to at least 4 ecs in the complex . finally , the derivation of constrained distance values for star - forming complexes is important for spiral arm structure studies ( e.g. @xcite ) , by providing a kinematically - independent determination , especially for central and anti - centre directions .",
