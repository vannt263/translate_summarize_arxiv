    "we consider neither the offset nor the elongation to be significant because these are most likely due to the beam size and the low snr .",

    "in the innermost coma , collisions between cold cometary species dominate the rotational population of the gas , but in the less dense outer coma the collision time becomes longer than the time for absorption of solar photons and the subsequent cascade of emission in that case , the population can also be determined by solar radiation driven fluorescence .",
    "fluorescence effects could allow lte to be maintained at a lower density than required in optically thin cases ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite determined that for the @xmath31 transition of hcn for comet hyakutake ( c/1996 b2 ) the transition between collisionally dominated and fluorescence dominated emission is between 26,000 and 38,000 km from the nucleus .",
    "since both comet linear and comet neat have similar water production rates relative to comet hyakutake ( d.  g.  schleicher , 2004 , private communication)(see  [ sec : h2o ] ) at comparable heliocentric distances , we assume their transition radii are also comparable . on the sky",
    "this translates to 82 - 119  for comet linear and 59 - 86   for comet neat .",
    "the synthesized beams sample a cylinder of gas through each comet , and because the hcn volume density falls off faster than @xmath32 due to photodissociation , most of the contribution to the integrated line intensity will come from a sample on the order of the size of the projected synthesized beam . since the synthesized beam is much smaller than the outer radii of the collisionally dominated regions , conditions significantly outside of the beam are not likely to affect our observations .",
    "the contribution from different cometocentric radii ( i.e. from different source sizes ) is determined by two factors .",
    "the first is that sources of differing size but equal total flux do not have equal peak fluxes and thus , when summed together , do not contribute equally to the total peak flux of a map .",
    "the second is that the array starts to resolve out flux from sources that are much larger than the synthesized beam .",
    "the first effect is dominant for source sizes that are on the order of the synthesized beam while the second becomes more dominant for larger source sizes .",
    "these two effects are illustrated in figure  [ fig : resp ] .",
    "the top panel is from our comet linear observations and the lower panel is from our comet neat observations .",
    "the abscissa is cometocentric radius in arcseconds of a source on the sky and the ordinate is @xmath33 , the array recovery factor ( see appendix  [ adx : model ] for a detailed explanation ) .",
    "the collisionally dominated region of the coma is labeled `` collisional zone '' , the transition between the collisionally dominated and fluorescence dominated regions is denoted by the hatching , and the fluorescence dominated region is labeled `` fluorescence zone '' .",
    "the solid line shows the peak flux detected by the array from each source size as a percentage of the peak flux of a point source of equal total flux .",
    "thus , both from this figure and the above argument , it is clear that we are sampling the collisionally dominated region and are insensitive to fluorescence effects .",
    "our calculations are made assuming optically thin emission , since the limits on the satellite hyperfine components show that they are significantly weaker than the main component . for cross - correlation observations ,",
    "@xmath34 , the beam - averaged molecular column density , is @xmath35 in equation  ( [ eq : ntot ] ) , @xmath36 in jy beam@xmath4 km s@xmath4 , and @xmath37 is the flux density per beam .",

    "we consider the case where the temperature and outflow velocity vary with cometocentric distance , as has been observed and modeled in previous comets ( e.g. comet hyakutake and comet hale - bopp @xcite ) .",
    "we label this as the variable temperature and outflow velocity ( vtov ) model . in order to do this",
    ", we modeled the hcn emission as concentric shells ( of thickness 100 km out to a radius of 10,000 km and a thickness of 2000 km for radii of 10,000 - 30,000 km ) around the nucleus and calculated the total column density and production rate . since we consider both comets to be similar to comet hyakutake , we used the velocity profiles from figure 3 of @xcite or the fit to that data from @xcite to give velocities to each shell .",
    "the april 9 profile was used for comet linear and the march 30 profile and fit was used for comet neat , since on these dates comet hyakutake was at a similar heliocentric distance .",
    "these velocities were scaled to match the observed velocity profile of the spectral line , taking into account thermal broadening .",
    "similarly , the temperature profiles for each comet were also taken from @xcite .",

    "we assume a rotation temperature of 115 k @xcite and for comet neat we assume a rotation temperature of 52 k. the temperature for comet neat was derived from figure 3 of @xcite by averaging across the section of their march 30 curve we are sensitive to , when comet hyakutake was at a similar heliocentric distance . using the above temperature for comet linear we find a total beam averaged hcn column density ( corrected for the other hyperfine components ) of @xmath34 = 9.5@xmath293.2@xmath47 @xmath2 . using the above temperature for comet neat",
    "we find a total beam averaged hcn column density ( corrected for the other hyperfine components ) of @xmath34 = 9.6@xmath295.1@xmath48 @xmath2 .",
    "to calculate @xmath52 , the parent molecule production rate , we use the total beam averaged column densities with the haser model @xcite . since the haser model assumes a constant outflow velocity , it is better suited for the fluorescence region rather than the inner , collisionally dominated , coma .",
    "however , we will compare the haser model results with our model since the haser model has been commonly used by previous cometary observations @xcite .    for a photodissociation scale length @xmath53 , nuclear radius @xmath54 , and constant radial outflow velocity @xmath55 , the density as a function of @xmath56 , @xmath57 ,",
    "is given by @xcite : @xmath58    for comets linear and neat , we assume a nuclear radius of @xmath54 = 5 km .",
    "we use a radial outflow velocity of @xmath55 = 0.62 km s@xmath4 for comet linear , based on the hwhm of the gaussian fit and taking into account the 10% increase in line width due to thermal broadening @xcite and @xmath55 = 0.59 km s@xmath4 for comet neat , based on the single channel half width of the line and taking into account thermal broadening .",
    "consider a point on the line of sight that passes a projected distance , @xmath59 , in the plane of the sky from the nucleus .",
    "for a given value of @xmath60 , measured along the line of sight , this will correspond to a radial distance @xmath61 from the nucleus .",

    "the quiet sun hcn photodissociation rate in the solar uv field at @xmath64 = 1 au is given by @xcite as @xmath18(1 au ) = 1.3 @xmath65 s@xmath4 and by @xcite as 1.5 @xmath65 s@xmath4 .",

    "the column densities calculated with the vtov model ( model 1 ) are 11 - 33% lower than those calculated with model 2 . however , the production rates calculated with the vtov model are 22 - 36% higher than those calculated with the haser model ( see model 2 in @xmath14[sec : haser ] ) .",
    "these differences are not large .",
    "however , the vtov model provides a better approximation than the haser model for the physical conditions in the cometary collisional regions that the bima array sampled .",

    "the variable temperature and outflow velocity ( vtov ) model consists of concentric spherical shells centered on a cometary nucleus of radius 5 km .",

    "30,000 km is equivalent to a cometocentric radius of 94on the sky for comet linear and 67.9for comet neat .",
    "this distance was chosen as the outer limit of our model because the structures of this size contribute less than 0.1% to the peak flux and the population of hcn at this radius is less than 40% that of the central shell due to photodissociation .",
    "thus , by the combination of these factors the contribution from any shells beyond 30,000 km would be negligible .",
    "while quantities such as the outflow velocity and temperature vary in a very non - linear way across the coma of each comet , the changes across any given shell are small enough to be considered linear .",

    "the recovery factor is found in the following way : 1 .",
