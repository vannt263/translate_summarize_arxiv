    ". how did this transition take place ?",
    "the leading hypothesis , strongly supported by cobe s discovery of anisotropies in the cmb ( see ned wright s contribution to these proceedings ) , is that gravitational instability amplified tiny fluctuations present in the early universe into the rich structure that we observe today .",

    "what are the values of the mass density parameter , @xmath4 , and the cosmological constant ( a.k.a",
    ".  vacuum energy density ) , @xmath5 ?    in principle , a set of answers to these questions , together with values of parameters like @xmath6 and the baryon density parameter @xmath7 , constitutes a theory of structure formation .",
    "however , there is a large gap between a theory specified at this level and a set of observationally testable predictions .",
    "numerical simulations that start from the theoretically specified initial conditions and evolve them forward in time play an essential role in bridging this gap .",
    "they show whether and how a theoretical model can produce objects like galaxies , quasars , and quasar absorption systems .",
    "they often provide greater understanding of observational phenomena , since in the simulations one knows the physical conditions , geometry , and history of the objects that form and the relation between the observable tracers of structure and the underlying distribution of dark matter .",
    "this understanding is specific to a theoretical model or class of theoretical models , but to the extent that the simulations reproduce the observations , one may be tempted to believe at least the general features of the physical picture that they provide , even if it is not correct in all of its details . by systematically exploring a range of models ,",
    "one can see how changes in initial conditions , cosmological parameters , or physical assumptions reveal themselves in properties of observable structure .",
    "while cosmological simulations are often complex and computationally intensive , some aspects of the results may be simple to understand , and in such cases the simulations often suggest new analytic approximations , whose accuracy and range of validity can be tested against the numerical results .",
    "simulations can also guide the development of new quantitative tools for characterizing observational data , providing physical motivation for the methods and showing what properties of the underlying structure are constrained by different measures .",
    "finally , simulations yield quantitative predictions for these statistical measures . by comparing them to observational data",
    ", one can test the general physical picture of structure formation that emerges from the simulations , and one can distinguish between cosmological models that make different assumptions about primordial fluctuations , dark matter , and the values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .    in this paper we will describe several applications of cosmological simulations , focusing on our recent work using simulations with gas dynamics to investigate galaxy formation and the ly@xmath3  forest at @xmath8 .",
    "n - body simulations are the workhorses of numerical cosmology .",
    "the basic technique is to represent the mass distribution in some region of the universe with a set of discrete particles , which start from an approximately uniform distribution ( usually a grid , occasionally a poisson distribution , or , more recently , a `` glass '' configuration [ @xcite ] in which the particle distribution is irregular but the gravitational potential is uniform ) .",
    "a simulation begins at high redshift , using the zeldovich ( 1970 ) approximation to perturb the particles away from this uniform distribution according to a random realization of the fluctuations predicted by a theoretical model .",
    "the n - body code then integrates the equations of motion forward in discrete timesteps , computing the gravitational potential from the particle distribution , the particle accelerations from the potential gradients , the updated particle velocities from the accelerations , and the updated particle positions from the velocities .",
    "gravitational forces are softened on small scales in order to suppress two - body scattering , since the particles are supposed to represent a collisionless fluid rather than discrete objects .",
    "the limits of a simulation s dynamic range are set on the upper end by the box size ( the typical simulation volume is a periodic cube whose size remains fixed in _ comoving _ coordinates ) and on the lower end by the particle mass and the scale of the gravitational force softening .",
    "depending on the application , the mass resolution or the force resolution may be the more important limiting factor .",
    "cosmological n - body algorithms differ mainly in the way that they compute the gravitational accelerations from the particle distribution . for sensible choices of numerical parameters ,",
    "different codes generally give consistent results on resolved scales when they are started from the same initial conditions .",
    "the gravitational clustering of matter in an expanding universe appears to be a `` forgiving '' numerical problem , mainly because non - linear gravitational collapse effectively transfers information from large scales to small scales ( @xcite ) . as a result",
    ", numerical errors on small scales do not propagate upwards to affect large scale clustering ; instead , these errors are themselves `` overwritten '' when larger scale structures collapse",
    ".    early work with n - body simulations showed that gravitational instability models with plausible initial conditions could reproduce , at least approximately , many of the basic observed properties of galaxy clustering , such as the correlation function , the group multiplicity function , and the large scale pattern of voids , sheets , and filaments ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . by the mid-1980s",
    ", the focus of n - body work had moved to quantitative measures of large scale structure in different cosmological models , with the aim of distinguishing between hot dark matter and cold dark matter and between an @xmath9 universe and an open universe ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "most of these studies adopted the general picture proffered by the most natural versions of inflationary cosmology : adiabatic , gaussian primordial fluctuations with a scale - invariant power spectrum .",
    "however , there were also some investigations of models with other mechanisms for generating fluctuations , such as cosmic strings ( @xcite ; @xcite ) or textures ( @xcite ) .",
    "as computers have become faster and codes more widely available , n - body simulations have moved from a numerical specialty to a basic tool of the cosmological trade . the ability to run large numbers of simulations at reasonable computational expense",
    "has made it possible to carry out systematic investigations of the parameter space of initial fluctuations and cosmological parameters ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and to create artificial redshift catalogs to aid the assessment of systematic and statistical errors in analyses of observational data ( _ numerous _ examples , such as @xcite ) .",
    "other recent work with n - body simulations includes studies of the density profiles and survival of substructure in dark matter halos ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) and tests of analytic descriptions of halo merger histories ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "the initial fluctuations are gaussian , as predicted by inflation , and their amplitude is normalized to the amplitude of cmb anisotropies observed by cobe .",
    "non - linear gravitational evolution transforms the gaussian initial fluctuations into a network of rounded voids and tunnels interleaved with sheets and filaments .",
    "the expanded views show that the extended high density structures are themselves made up of smaller dark matter clumps .",
    "simulations that mimic the geometry and selection parameters of galaxy redshift surveys show a good qualitative match between the predictions of cdm models and the observed morphology of large scale structure ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the qualitative and semi - quantitative demonstration that non - linear gravitational evolution of `` generic '' gaussian initial conditions with a reasonable power spectrum can reproduce the basic observed properties of large scale structure is probably the most important general result to emerge from cosmological n - body studies .",
    "the weakness of n - body simulations is that they do not show where , when , or even whether galaxies form .",
    "the smaller dark matter clumps presumably correspond to the halos of individual galaxies , but additional assumptions are required to assign luminosities to these halos .",
    "more seriously , gravitational collapse and tidal disruption erase substructure in the cores of virialized objects . by virtue of their masses , the largest halos in n - body simulations like",
    "the one shown in figure  [ figcdm ] should correspond to rich galaxy clusters , but the inner regions of these halos are smooth , without multiple condensations that could correspond to the halos of individual galaxies .",
    "the rapidity with which substructure is erased by virialization depends to some extent on the resolution of the n - body simulation ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) , but at bottom the problem appears to be not numerical but physical : gravitational dynamics alone can not explain the existence of galaxy groups and clusters ( @xcite ; but see @xcite for an alternative view ) .",
    "in order to model galaxy formation , cosmological simulations must include additional physics that affects baryonic matter . in keeping with currently popular theories of structure formation ,",
    "cosmological simulations with gas dynamics usually include a collisionless dark matter component , treated by the n - body technique described in  2 .",
    "the dark matter interacts gravitationally with the gas component , which also responds dynamically to shocks and pressure gradients .",
    "the thermal state of the gas is influenced by adiabatic compression and expansion , by entropy generation in shocks , by radiative cooling , by photoionization heating from the background radiation field , and , at high redshift ( @xmath13 ) , by compton cooling against the cmb .",
    "eulerian hydrodynamic codes solve the gas equations by finite difference methods on a fixed mesh .",
    "these types of codes have been widely used in other areas of astronomy , physics , and engineering , and they are able to take advantage of sophisticated schemes for capturing shocks .",
    "their principal drawback for studies of galaxy formation is the fixed spatial mesh ; with existing computers , it is impractical to achieve resolution of a few kpc in a cosmologically interesting volume ( several mpc or more on a side ) .",
    "lagrangian mesh codes or spatially adaptive eulerian mesh codes can potentially achieve high resolution in collapsed regions without requiring enormous computational grids . an alternative way to achieve spatially adaptive resolution",
    "is smoothed - particle hydrodynamics ( sph ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "sph codes represent the gas with particles ; densities and pressure gradients are computed by averaging ( `` smoothing '' ) over neighboring particles .",
    "the smoothing is usually carried out over a fixed number of neighbors , so the spatial resolution of the hydrodynamic calculations automatically increases in the high density regions where it is most needed .",
    "the strength of sph for cosmological applications lies in this high dynamic range .",
    "the use of particles rather than a grid also makes the technique flexible and ensures that dark matter and gas are modeled with the same gravitational resolution .",
    "the code that we use for our simulations is treesph ( @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter kwh ) , which uses a hierarchical tree code ( @xcite ; @xcite ) for gravitational force calculations and sph for hydrodynamic calculations .",
    "figure  [ figcluster ] shows how dissipation in the gas component works to resolve the `` overmerging '' problem raised at the end of  2 .",
    "the left hand panels are drawn from an n - body simulation ( actually a treesph simulation with no sph component ) of the `` standard '' cdm model ( scdm , with @xmath9 , @xmath14 , and an rms mass fluctuation in @xmath15 spheres of @xmath16 ) .",
    "the full simulation volume is a comoving cube 22 mpc on a side , but the figure shows only those particles that end up in a sphere of radius 1.25 mpc centered on the richest dark matter concentration .",
    "the mass in this sphere , @xmath17 , corresponds to the dark halo of a small cluster of galaxies .    at @xmath18 , the particles that will form the cluster reside in a number of smaller halos . as gravitational clustering proceeds ,",
    "these halos merge , and the final product ( lower left panel ) is a single virialized object , centrally concentrated but with little substructure .",
    "center panels show the dark matter component from an sph simulation started from the same initial conditions .",
    "right hand panels show the gas particles from the sph simulation .",
    "heavier points have been used to represent gas particles that are cold ( @xmath19k ) at @xmath20 ; lighter points represent hotter particles ( most of which have @xmath21k ) .",
    "= 5.1truein    the evolution of the dark matter in the sph simulation is similar to that in the pure n - body simulation , indicating that the gas component , with a mass fraction @xmath22 , has little dynamical effect on the dark matter . at @xmath18 ,",
    "the gas and dark matter distributions are also quite similar .",
    "when the gas falls into the dark halos , it is shock heated to roughly the virial temperature of the potential well , converting its kinetic infall energy into thermal energy .",
    "however , some fraction of the gas is able to radiate its energy by atomic cooling processes ( see kwh for details ) ; this gas loses pressure support and settles into highly overdense knots at the halo centers .",
    "these dense knots are much more resistant to disruption than the relatively puffy halos that form in the dissipationless n - body simulation , and they are able to survive as distinct entities even after their parent halos merge to form the cluster . at @xmath20 , there are eight of these dense , cold knots in the cluster , while the hot gas is smoothly distributed with a density profile roughly like that of the dark matter .",
    "the cold knots contain nearly 50% of the cluster s baryonic mass , though they look rather inconspicuous in figure  [ figcluster ] because they are only @xmath23 kpc in size .",
    "inspection of the bottom panels shows that the baryons , after following the dark matter s directions about where to collapse , do have a small `` back reaction '' : the gravity of the condensed gas draws in the nearby dark matter , and the knots in the outer part of the cluster have retained small dark matter halos that are not present in the purely gravitational simulation .",
    "further aspects of this simulation are discussed in katz , hernquist , & weinberg ( 1992 ) and kwh .",
    "the process illustrated in figure  [ figcluster ] is essentially the one envisioned by white & rees in 1978 , but modeling this process numerically required enormous advances in computer hardware and in algorithms for treating gravity and gas dynamics .",
    "it was not until the early 1990s that the formation of cold gas concentrations with masses , sizes , and overdensities comparable to the luminous regions of observed galaxies was achieved in hydrodynamic cosmological simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "even simulations like these do not resolve the internal structure of the `` galaxies '' that form in them .",
    "however , simulations that zoom in on individual objects can achieve the higher resolution needed to examine some of the details of galaxy formation ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; steinmetz & mller 1994 , 1995 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we now shift focus to high redshift , the scene of much of the most exciting observational and theoretical activity over the last few years .",

    "the inference of the global star formation rate from observations depends on the assumed extinction correction and on the assumed imf , so it is probably premature to say whether the numerical or semi - analytic predictions are in better agreement with the data .",

    "this picture of the ly@xmath3  forest bears some resemblance to the `` intracluster medium '' view of quasar absorption lines suggested by bahcall & salpeter ( 1965 ) , and it is quite similar to the inhomogeneous igm models described by mcgill ( 1990 ) and bi ( 1993 ) .",
    "what turns the fluctuating gunn - peterson idea from a novelty into a powerful conceptual tool is the simplicity of the physics that governs the ionization state of the low density gas .",
    "this gas is in photoionization equilibrium , so the neutral hydrogen density @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the photoionization rate and the @xmath70 factor accounts for the temperature dependence of the hydrogen recombination coefficient near @xmath31 .",

    ", we therefore expect @xmath72 , where @xmath73 . in principle",

    "the peculiar velocity term accounts for the mapping from real space to redshift space .",

    ", one can run a lower resolution n - body simulation , compute the density field from the particle distribution , impose the temperature - density relation , and extract spectra .",
    "this technique uses a fully non - linear solution for the density and velocity fields , but it still assumes that gas traces dark matter and that all gas lies on the temperature - density relation , approximations that are good but not perfect .",
    "the dotted lines in figure  [ figspec ] show spectra along the same ten lines of sight computed by this method from an n - body simulation with the same initial conditions .",
    "agreement with the full hydrodynamic simulation is very good over most of the spectrum , breaking down in a few regions where shock heating pushes gas off the assumed temperature - density relation .",
    "similar techniques have been used by gnedin & hui ( 1997 ) , who also incorporate an approximate treatment of gas pressure in the n - body calculation , and by petitjean , mcket , & kates ( 1995 ) and mcket et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , who use a more elaborate method to compute gas temperatures .",
    "one can simplify equation  ( [ fgpa ] ) by ignoring the peculiar velocity derivative @xmath77 .",
    "the resulting approximation is somewhat less accurate , but it is more analytically tractable because it implies a one - to - one relation between the optical depth and the local overdensity , @xmath87 .",
    "peculiar velocities affect @xmath88 and the redshift space density in the same sense  a converging flow enhances both , for example  but the redshift space @xmath88@xmath89 relation has larger scatter than the real space @xmath88@xmath89 relation because the neutral hydrogen fraction depends on the real space , physical density .",
    "nonetheless , spectra from the hydrodynamical simulations , which include peculiar velocities , thermal broadening , shock heating , and collisional ionization , exhibit an impressively tight correlation between @xmath88 and @xmath89 even in redshift space ( @xcite , figure 6 ) .",

    "@xmath97 is the fraction of baryons in the `` warm '' igm that produces most of the ly@xmath3  forest , more specifically , the fraction of gas that has not been substantially shock heated and therefore lies on the temperature - density relation . roughly speaking ,",
    "this is gas with @xmath26 .    as a fiducial value of the optical depth integral in equation  ( [ igm ] ) , we have used the value 0.70 obtained from spectra of the scdm model at @xmath25 .",

    "we therefore use @xmath90 from the noiseless simulated spectra as an estimate of the true optical depth distribution , free of observational artifacts .",
    "since @xmath88 can not be determined accurately in saturated regions , we set @xmath98 whenever @xmath99 ( 9% of the spectrum ) , so that @xmath100 is slightly underestimated . ignoring peculiar velocities",
    "also causes equation  ( [ igm ] ) to underestimate @xmath100 , but only by @xmath101 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "cosmological parameters influence the estimate of @xmath100 only through @xmath102 and the ratio @xmath83 . at @xmath25 ,",
    "this ratio is 5.51 for for @xmath84 , @xmath85 , 4.46 for @xmath84 , @xmath103 , and 8.0 for @xmath104 , @xmath105 .    with a conservative value for the igm temperature , @xmath106 , and a conservative constraint on the photoionization rate , @xmath107 ( see @xcite ) , equation  ( [ igm ] ) implies a lower bound @xmath108 .",
    "this is a substantial fraction of the total baryon density @xmath109 derived from big bang nucleosynthesis with the burles & tytler ( 1997 ) estimate of the primordial deuterium abundance ( see also @xcite , who estimate @xmath110 , and @xciteab , who estimate a much smaller density , @xmath111 ) .",
    "comparison of these values shows that the warm igm is the dominant reservoir of high redshift baryons , with @xmath112 .",
    "this conclusion does not rely on the simulations explicitly , only on the rauch et al .",
    "( 1997b ) @xmath90 measurement and on the assumption that ly@xmath3   forest absorbers are , on average , no more extended in redshift space than they are in real space ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the simulations do _ predict _ that most baryons reside in the warm igm at @xmath25 , in accord with this observational inference .",
    "the values of @xmath97 ( specifically , the fraction of the baryons with @xmath44 ) are 0.69 , 0.67 , and 0.49 for the scdm , ocdm , and ccdm models , respectively .",
    "one can use equation  ( [ igm ] ) to estimate @xmath7 by assuming a value of @xmath97 and putting in best estimates for other parameters .",
    "for example , with @xmath113 , @xmath114 ( @xcite ) , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 at @xmath25 , one obtains @xmath117 .",
    "the largest uncertainty at present is the rauch et al .",
    "( 1997b ) @xmath90 measurement itself , which is based on a fairly small quasar sample .",
    "however , the same analysis at @xmath34 ( again with the rauch et al .  data ) yields nearly the same @xmath7 , and results from a larger data sample should be available soon .",
    "most traditional methods of characterizing ly@xmath3  forest spectra begin by decomposing each spectrum into a set of lines , usually assumed to have voigt profiles .",
    "( for a line with @xmath118 , damping wings are insignificant , and a voigt profile is simply a gaussian optical depth profile . ) comparisons between simulated spectra and observational data using line decomposition methods show that cdm models with reasonable parameters match the observed statistical distributions of neutral hydrogen column densities and line widths fairly well ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , while any spectrum can be represented as a superposition of a sufficient number of voigt - profile lines , the simulations suggest that such a superposition is not a natural or robust description of the ly@xmath3  forest .",
    "the individual `` absorbers '' in the simulations are extended , out - of - equilibrium structures , which do not produce voigt - profile lines .",
    "furthermore , because there are no clear boundaries between the absorbers and the background medium , the mere division of the spectrum into a collection of lines is somewhat artificial .",
    "equation  ( [ fgpa ] ) suggests a more natural point of view : to a good approximation , a ly@xmath3  forest spectrum is a non - linear map of the continuous , redshift - space density field along the line of sight .",
    "statistical measures that treat the spectrum as a continuous field are likely to be more powerful than line decomposition methods for discriminating cosmological models , because they involve minimal manipulation of the observational data and because they are better attuned to the underlying physics of the absorbing medium .",
    "one particularly simple measure is the distribution function of flux decrements @xmath119 , where @xmath120 and @xmath121 is the fraction of pixels with flux decrement in the range @xmath122 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this statistic is directly analogous to the counts - in - cells distribution frequently used in studies of large scale structure ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "another simple statistic is the threshold crossing frequency , the average number of times per unit redshift that the spectrum crosses a specified transmission threshold ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a plot of this crossing frequency against spectral filling factor is directly analogous to the `` genus curve '' used to characterize the topology of the galaxy density field ( @xcite ) .",
    "we are currently using simulations  both full hydrodynamic calculations and the `` pseudo - hydro '' n - body technique described earlier  to see how these statistical measures respond to properties of the cosmological model .",
    "the preliminary results accord well with expectations from the fluctuating gunn - peterson approximation and the analogies to large scale structure statistics . for models with gaussian initial conditions ,",
    "the flux decrement distribution @xmath119 depends mainly on the amplitude of the mass power spectrum on comoving scales @xmath123 .",
    "increasing the power spectrum amplitude skews the distribution of overdensities @xmath124 , and this in turn skews the flux decrement distribution because of the correlation between @xmath88 and @xmath74 .",
    "models with non - gaussian initial conditions produce a different overdensity distribution ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , so we expect that @xmath119 will also be a sensitive discriminant between gaussian and non - gaussian models , though we have not yet studied this issue numerically .",
    "the threshold crossing statistic measures the `` corrugation '' of the absorption spectrum  a spectrum with more small scale structure has more crossings per unit redshift . like its 3-dimensional cousin , the genus curve",
    ", the threshold crossing frequency depends on the logarithmic _ slope _ of the underlying mass power spectrum ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a mass density field with a bluer power spectrum produces choppier absorption and a higher crossing frequency .",
    "thermal broadening and peculiar velocities also influence the crossing frequency by physically smoothing the absorption on small scales .",
    "one can investigate larger scale clustering by artificially smoothing the absorption spectrum ( e.g. , convolving with a gaussian filter ) and applying the same measures , just as one might study the galaxy counts - in - cells distribution or the topology of the galaxy density field at many spatial scales .",
    "for example , if the mass distribution is strongly clustered on large scales , then the flux decrement distribution @xmath119 remains skewed even in the smoothed spectrum .",
    "if the large scale clustering is weak , then @xmath119 quickly settles towards a sharply peaked , roughly gaussian form as the smoothing is increased .",
    "one can also probe larger scale clustering via the flux correlation function ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) or power spectrum ( @xcite ) .",
    "these measures are closely related to the correlation function and power spectrum of the mass density itself , and by measuring them at several redshifts one can observe the growth of density fluctuations over time .",
    "high resolution spectrographs on large telescopes yield ly@xmath3  forest spectra of spectacular quality .",
    "as the above discussion indicates , the information content of these spectra is prodigious , and it can be directly related to cosmological parameters and to basic properties of the mass distribution at high redshift .",
    "equally important , the simplicity of the physical processes that affect the low density igm allows cosmological simulations to make robust quantitative predictions for a specified cosmological model .",
    "the ly@xmath3  forest therefore offers an excellent arena in which to test theories of structure formation .",
    "in addition to comparing specific models to observations , one can work backwards from the absorption spectra to derive the shape and amplitude of the primordial mass power spectrum .",
    "this approach is described by croft et al .",
    "( 1997c ) , and tests on artificial spectra from the simulations show that it works remarkably well , neatly circumventing the uncertain physics of galaxy formation , which complicates the interpretation of power spectra measured from galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "application to songaila & cowie s ( 1996 ) spectrum of q1422 + 231 yields a @xmath25 power spectrum consistent with the scdm and ocdm models considered here .",
    "this cosmological test will become much more sensitive in the near future , when the technique is applied to larger quasar samples .",
    "taken together , the results described in the preceding sections tell an encouraging tale : as cosmological simulations incorporate progressively more realistic physics , they explain a progressively wider range of observational data .",
    "collisionless n - body simulations show that non - linear gravitational evolution transforms gaussian primordial fluctuations into a pattern of sheets , filaments , tunnels , and voids that closely resembles the structure seen in 3-dimensional maps of the galaxy distribution .",
    "simulations that add gas dynamics , radiative cooling , and star formation produce dense clumps of stars and cold gas with sizes and masses similar to those of luminous galaxies .",
    "simulations that include photoionization by the uv radiation background match the ly@xmath3  forest absorption seen in the spectra of high redshift quasars .",
    "numerical simulations of structure formation in a universe dominated by collisionless dark matter offer a unified account of disparate observational phenomena , from large scale structure to the ly@xmath3  forest .",
    "the gravitational instability scenario can also account for important phenomena not covered in this review , such as cmb anisotropies ( wright , these proceedings ) and hot gas in galaxy clusters ( donahue , these proceedings ) .",
    "crucial questions about the nature and amount of dark matter , the geometry of spacetime , and the origin of primordial fluctuations remain open , but the range of plausible answers already seems much narrower than it did 10 years ago .",
    "space observatories , large telescopes , and ambitious surveys are providing a rich , diverse harvest of data , and cosmological simulations are becoming more powerful and sophisticated , so we can expect great progress in the decade ahead .",
