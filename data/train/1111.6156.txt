    "congestion games form a natural class of games that are useful in modeling many realistic settings , such as traffic and communication networks , routing , load balancing and more .",
    "a symmetric congestion game is a 4-tuple @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a finite set of players , @xmath2 is a finite set of resources , @xmath3 is the set of players strategies , and for any @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the resource s payoff function .",
    "a strategy of a player is a choice of a subset resources , @xmath6 . for any strategy tuple @xmath7 let @xmath8 denote the number of players that utilize @xmath9 ( a.k.a .",
    "the congestion of the resource @xmath9 ) and denote by @xmath10 the congestion vector .",
    "the utility of a player is the total payment for the resources she utilizes .",
    "formally , @xmath11    a congestion game is _ monotone _ if for for any @xmath12 and @xmath4 , @xmath13 .",
    "monotone congestion games widely prevail in modeling traffic and communication problems , production resource allocation and more . in _ single - signed _ congestion games payments are either all positive or all negative . typically ,",
    "whenever monotone congestion games are used for modeling , they are assumed single - signed .",
    "a _ congestion game form _ is a pair @xmath14 , composed of the set of resources and a set of strategies ( subsets of @xmath2 ) . for any congestion game",
    "@xmath15 let @xmath16 denote the corresponding game form .",
    "given a congestion game form @xmath17 , let @xmath18 monotone@xmath19 denote the class of all monotone congestion games with the game form @xmath17 .",
    "we say that a strategy set , @xmath20 , is _ subset - free _ if for any @xmath21 we have @xmath22 and @xmath22 .",
    "thus , a _ a subset - free congestion game ( form ) _ is a congestion game ( form ) with a subset - free strategy space . for any equilibrium analysis of single - signed monotone congestion games",
    "the assumption of subset free strategy sets is without loss of generality . in particular , note that in such games for any pair of strategies @xmath23 in @xmath24 either @xmath25 is dominated by @xmath26 ( in case resource payments are all positive ) or @xmath26 is dominated by @xmath25 ( in case resource payments are all negative ) and so after deletion of dominated strategies we are left with subset free sets .    as usual ,",
    "a profile @xmath27 is a pure ne of @xmath28 , if for each player @xmath29 , for each strategy @xmath30 , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the vector of strategies of all players but @xmath29 .",
    "informally , a set of strategies is a nash equilibrium if no player can do better by unilaterally deviating .",
    "the set of all pure ne of a congestion game @xmath28 will be denoted @xmath33 .",
    "congestion games were introduced by rosenthal ( 1973 ) @xcite , who proved that any congestion game has a nash equilibrium in pure strategies . in spite of this fact there is still valid concern about the prevalence of a nash equilibrium in reality .",
    "there are two classical criticisms over the validity of a nash equilibrium profile as a _ solution concept _ which can be made - one that is computationally driven and another that is rationality driven .",
    "the latter criticism is based on the fact that for an equilibrium to prevail players must have common knowledge of rationality , a condition typically unrealistic .",
    "the former criticism argues that the existence of a pure nash equilibrium does not imply it is computationally simple to find such an equilibrium .",
    "in particular , whenever the strategy space is rich this may be a challenging endeavor . in general , this may require searching over all strategy tuples",
    ", whose number can grow exponentially with the number of players . however , as congestion games have the _ finite improvement property",
    "_ one could suspect that it may be easier to find such an equilibrium .",
    "however , it turns out that improvement paths can be exponentially long , as demonstrated by ieong et al .",
    "@xcite and fabricant et al .",
    "recently fabrikant et al .",
    "@xcite provide an algorithm that finds a nash equilibrium in polynomial time , for an important subset of congestion games .",
    "this is done via a reduction to a flow problem , yet leaves little insight regarding the nature of the ne .",
    "fotakis et al .",
    "( 2005 ) @xcite introduce the notion of a _ greedy strategy profile_. let us consider a dynamic setting with the players joining the game sequentially .",
    "each player , upon arrival , irrevocably chooses a best response strategy to the choice of strategies of the previous players , while ignoring subsequent players .",
    "the resulting strategy profile is called a _ greedy strategy profile_. let us denote by @xmath34 the set of all greedy strategy profiles .",
    "note the two degrees of freedom in the process - the order of the agents and the tie - breaking rule in case of indifference among several options .",
    "formally , @xmath35 , if there exists a permutation @xmath36 of the players ( @xmath37 denotes the order of @xmath29 ) such that for any player @xmath29 who chooses strategy @xmath38 we have @xmath39 @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the number players preceding @xmath29 according to the permutation @xmath42 whose strategy includes resource @xmath9 .",
    "clearly @xmath43 , and typically @xmath34 may contain many such profiles .",
    "in contrast with the rationality assumption underlying the notion of nash equilibrium , the rationality requirement from a greedy profile is very low , possibly too low , as players clearly choose to ignore anything they do not observe .",
    "in addition , calculating a greedy equilibrium profile is a much less demanding task than calculating a nash equilibrium .",
    "hypothetically , whenever @xmath44 the prevalence of an equilibrium is much more likely .",
    "this is because the identity of the two sets suggests that the rationality assumption underlying an equilibrium profile is weak and the complexity of finding such an equilibrium is typically linear with respect to the number of players .",
    "this motivates us to study the relationship between the sets @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "fotakis et al .",
    "@xcite have already shown that @xmath45 for simple congestion games .",
    "fotakis @xcite showed that if a class of congestion games that satisfy two conditions : ( 1 ) the game form is that of ` extension - parallel graph ' , namely one can map the resources to the set of edges in a extension - parallel graph and the strategies are the set of paths leading from a certain node in the graph ( designated as the source node ) to another node ( designated as the target node ) ; and ( 2 ) the resource payoff functions satisfy a property referred to as the ` common best reply ' requirement , met in symmetric congestion game .",
    "in particular , their result implies that @xmath45 for simple congestion games , where strategies are the singleton resource subsets of @xmath2 .",
    "additional papers that study conditions under which @xmath45 are ackerman et al .",
    "@xcite and fotakis @xcite . in ackerman",
    "@xcite the main observation is that greedy best responses converge very fast to a ne , when the strategy structure is that of a matroid , while in fotakis @xcite shows a theorem from which follows that in tree representable congestion games greedy leads to ne .",
    "this paper characterizes the setting for which @xmath34 and @xmath33 coincide .",
    "in particular , our main result argues that a necessary and sufficient conditions for these two solution concepts to coincide is that the the game form is that of ` extension - parallel graph ' .",
    "these results extend the state of the art knowledge in two ways .",
    "first , it is shown that for such game forms not only is every greedy profile a nash equilibrium but also vice versa .",
    "in addition , we show that for such equivalence to hold for a given game form it must be the4 case that the game form is of a certain class , namely a ` extension - parallel graph ' . in particular , given a game form not satisfying this condition , we show how to construct resource payoff functions such that the the set of ne profiles and greedy profiles will not coincide .",
    "the ` extension - parallel graph ' game form is also the necessary and sufficient condition for the set of ne profiles to coincide with the set of strong equilibrium profiles , as shown by holzman and law yone @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note that holzman and law yone @xcite refer ` tree representable ' game form which , a - priori , are different than ` extension - parallel graph ' game forms , but they go on and prove equivalence ( theorem 1 and theorem 2 ) .    combining the results in @xcite and @xcite and our contribution , we obtain equivalence for extension - parallel graph game forms ( or tree representable game forms ) between greedy profiles and strong ne . moreover , if the game is not form is not extension parallel graph it is possible to find payoffs where the equivalence will not hold .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows : section 2 provides a variety of examples that demonstrate that without any restrictions on the game form there is no connection between the sets @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "section 3 formalizes the notion of tree representable games , and discusses the characteristics of this class .",
    "then in section 4 we present and prove the main result , namely equivalence between @xmath33 and @xmath34 for tree representable congestion games .",
    "here we provide several examples for the various relations between @xmath34 and @xmath33 . as we shall demonstrate those can differ depending on the game in question .",
    "[ 3choose2 ] @xmath46 - greedy profiles and equilibria are mutually exclusive .",
    "in this example there are 3 players and 3 resources .",
    "the strategy space is the set of all pairs of resources .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + let @xmath47 be sufficiently large to ensure that @xmath48 .",
    "this game is in the spirit example [ 2layer ] ( with the addition of extra resources that yield negligible utility ) .",
    "similar to example [ 2layer ] this game does not satisfy @xmath49 , thus reaching a contradiction .",
    "the proof of theorem [ main theorem 1 ] follows from propositions [ trgg_gne ] and [ sufficient ] .",
    "monotone congestion games are a well proved modeling tool . in many realistic cases",
    "one can easily assume that the strategy set is subset - free ( e.g. , when strategies are paths leading from a source node to a target node ) or that resource payment functions are single - signed ( e.g. , they express latency over a graph edge and are hence negative ) .",
    "we show that in such cases the set of pure nash equilibria coincides with the set of greedy strategy profiles .",
    "we conclude that in such cases a nash equilibrium forms a viable solution concept as it emerges from very weak rationality assumptions and does not hinge on common knowledge of rationality .",
    "in addition , it can be the case that the computational difficulty of finding the equilibria set in such games is substantially weaker than in an arbitrary game or even an arbitrary congestion game .",
