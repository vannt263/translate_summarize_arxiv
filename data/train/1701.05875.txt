    "the high energy scale during inflation , presumably well beyond the reach of the current and future particle accelerator experiments , calls for an effective theory description of inflation @xcite .",
    "this is because by construction the effective field theory approach is systematic through which we can account for our ignorance .",
    "a key observation in writing the effective field theory of single - field inflation is to note that in the time - dependent background the time translational symmetry is broken , while spatial diffeomorphism is preserved @xcite .",
    "the couplings that determine the expansion of the effective theory of the goldstone mode @xmath5 , which realizes the time diffeomorphism , are represented by a set of mass scales @xmath6 . in the so - called decoupling regime",
    "the goldstone @xmath5 could decouple from the metric fluctuations and the effective action of @xmath5 is dramatically simplified . especially , the first expansion parameter @xmath7 is manifest in both quadratic and cubic order of @xmath5 : see .",
    "the observation that the coefficient @xmath7 is common to the quadratic and cubic action of @xmath5 indicates that , to leading order in the decoupling limit , the corresponding correlation functions  the power spectrum and bispectrum  are explicitly correlated .",
    "it means that ideally , given an explicit analytic form of the power spectrum theoretically , we can find unambiguously the corresponding bispectrum . or ,",
    "at the very least observationally , it remains tantalizing because of the existence of outliers in the power spectrum of the temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background  @xcite .",
    "the explicit correlation would make possible joint analysis using the two- and three - point correlation functions  @xcite , which can place much stronger constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "it can also open a compelling way of searching for new physics beyond the paradigm of standard slow - roll inflation , since any deviations would strongly signal the typical mass scale associated with new physics  @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we derive a direct and explicit relation between the power spectrum and bispectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation using the goldstone mode @xmath5 .",
    "such a correlation was first explicitly studied in the top - down approach @xcite and expanded into more general context in  @xcite , in which heavy degrees of freedom are integrated out to lead to an effective single field description of inflation  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "to leading order of the heavy mass scale , the speed of sound @xmath8 uniquely characterizes the effects of the heavy degrees of freedom @xcite , i.e. the coefficients of the effective theory .",
    "our approach here is conversely bottom - up , complementary to the previous studies as we will see in the main text .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in the next section , after briefly reviewing the effective field theory of inflation , we derive the simple expression of the correction to the power spectrum . by inverting it",
    "we can write the unknown , model - dependent effective theory parameter in terms of the power spectrum which can be constrained observationally . in section  [ sec : correlation ] , we derive a direct and explicit relation between the corrections of the power spectrum and bispectrum . in section  [ sec : squeezed ] we discuss the consistency relation of the squeezed bispectrum @xcite and the validity of the correlation we derive .",
    "the final section is devoted to summary and conclusions .",
    "in this section , after briefly reviewing the effective field theory of inflation , we give the formula of the correction to the power spectrum due to the deviation from usual slow - roll phase parametrized by the expansion coefficient of the effective theory .",
    "we begin with a brief review of the effective field theory of inflation  @xcite . in unitary gauge ,",
    "the information on the primordial curvature perturbation is encoded in geometrical quantities respecting the time - dependent spatial diffeomorphism symmetry .",
    "then , the action for the primordial curvature perturbation is written in general as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the extrinsic curvature with respect to @xmath11 constant hypersurface .",

    "it is noticed that time diffeomorphism invariance is broken in this action .",
    "but , it can be recovered by the introduction of the stckelberg field @xmath16 , which corresponds to the nambu - goldstone boson and transforms under the coordinate transformations @xmath17 and @xmath18 as @xmath19 in the decoupling regime @xmath20 , the action reduces to @xmath21   + 2m_2 ^ 4 \\left [ \\dot\\pi^2 + \\dot\\pi^3 - \\dot\\pi\\frac{(\\nabla\\pi)^2}{a^2 }       \\right ] - \\frac{4}{3}m_3 ^ 4\\dot\\pi^3 + \\cdots \\right\\ } \\ , , \\ ] ] where the dots represent the higher derivative terms .",

    "@xmath5 and @xmath26 are related to linear order by @xmath27 , so in the regime is valid we can to first approximation consider @xmath28 .",
    "we first concentrate on the quadratic part and evaluate the correction to power spectrum originating from the term with @xmath7 . since the standard slow - roll terms multiplied by @xmath29 in are dominant as various observations indicate , we treat the quadratic contribution of @xmath7 as perturbation . in terms of the speed of sound , we assume that for a limited duration @xmath8 deviates from unity , with the deviation being not too far away from unity . neglecting the metric perturbation as we consider the decoupling regime so that @xmath30 simply , from the quadratic part other than the usual slow - roll , which we may call second order interaction , is @xmath31 the interaction hamiltonian is then",

    "let us consider these two cases separately .",
    "our goal here is to see the form of the corrections to the power spectrum for each case .",
    "but this seems unclear , since the form of the interaction part of the quadratic action ",
    "just @xmath93 for @xmath8 , and @xmath93 and @xmath94 for @xmath92  is different .",
    "thus naively thinking the resulting correction terms would be of different structure .",
    "we first assume that @xmath8 solely supplies the deviations from the standard slow - roll in such a way that for a limited duration @xmath8 deviates from unity , with the deviation being not too far away from unity .",
    "we may then write , with the canonical slow - roll part being the leading , free part , @xmath95 + \\underbrace { \\int d^4x a^3{m_{\\rm pl}}^2\\epsilon \\left ( \\frac{1}{c_s^2 } - 1 \\right ) } _ { \\equiv s_\\text{2,int } } \\ , .\\ ] ] following the same steps as in section  [ subsec : power ] , we find @xmath96 which is of the same structure as .    for the case in which @xmath92 is responsible for the departure from the standard slow - roll , let us split @xmath92 into the slowly varying part @xmath97 and the rapidly varying but transient part @xmath98 : @xmath99 we can rewrite @xmath98 as @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the duration of departure and we have defined another slow - roll parameter @xmath102 .",
    "then the quadratic action , with @xmath103 this time , can be written as @xmath104 + \\underbrace { \\int d^4x a^3{m_{\\rm pl}}^2 \\delta\\epsilon \\left [ \\dot{{\\cal r}}^2 -                         \\frac{(\\nabla{{\\cal r}})^2}{a^2 }                        \\right ] } _ { \\equiv s_\\text{2,int } } \\ , , \\ ] ] and the corresponding correction to the power spectrum is @xmath105 comparing this with , we see that two sources of the departure from the standard slow - roll leads to the same structure of the correction as .",
    "this seems to suggest that indeed @xmath7 captures the deviation from usual slow - roll on general ground .",
    "we now return to our starting equation to clarify this inconsistency .",
    "a key observation is that unlike @xmath26 , which is frozen on super - horizon scales , @xmath5 evolves as @xmath106 where the non - linear terms follow from the fact that essentially @xmath5 is the time translation between spatially flat and comoving hypersurfaces  @xcite .",

    "do exist changes in @xmath110 terms as , but they are slow - roll suppressed . since we have only considered the leading effects that only capture the speed of sound , the bispectrum is enhanced in the equilateral configuration while it is not in the squeezed limit .",
    "indeed , by considering the sub - leading terms in , we have at cubic order new terms @xmath111 and @xmath112 that lead to non - vanishing bispectrum in the squeezed limit  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the new terms @xmath111 and @xmath112 in the cubic order action give up to numerical coefficient @xmath113 with @xmath114 .",
    "still the consistency relation is not recovered , but this is because we are not taking into account all the next - to - leading terms in the decoupling limit , such as the modification of the mode functions : terms of @xmath115 and @xmath116 do not contribute to the squeezed limit while only terms of @xmath117 do  @xcite .",
    "our calculation is done only up to the leading order .",
    "in this article , we have derived the direct relation between the corrections of power spectrum and bispectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation .",
    "our formula is based on the effective field theory approach to inflation , which to first approximation captures the effects of the non - trivial speed of sound . if we would observationally detect the deviation from the standard slow - roll inflation , it is important to check the relation derived here , which could prove / disprove whether such a deviation can be attributed to the variation of sound velocity .",
    "we have also shown that the corrections to the power spectrum from non - trivial features of sound velocity and expansion rate of the universe , which characterize the deviation from the standard slow - roll inflation , have the same form .",
    "it is interesting to check whether we can extend this kind of unified treatment to higher order correlation functions .",
    "we have also discussed the squeezed limit of the bispectrum and the consistency relation . in the leading order calculations",
    "we have adopted in this article , the squeezed limit vanishes .",
    "but , if we take into account sub - leading orders adequately , the consistency relation would be recovered .",
    "the next step is to include the sub - leading order effects such as the terms beyond decoupling limit and the @xmath118 terms .",
    "then , we will have further ( consistency ) relation , which is useful to identify new physics causing such a deviation .",
