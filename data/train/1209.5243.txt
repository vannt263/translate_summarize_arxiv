    "the current generation of mobile devices ( smartphones , tablets , laptops ) is frequently equipped with several   ( e.g.  3 g , wifi ) . the user must manually select which interface to use at any given time , according to the availability of   within communication distance . in order to make better use of multiple interfaces , we recently proposed the   mechanism  @xcite . keeps all interfaces active at the same time , and uses the best one for data transmission according to predefined criteria ( e.g. , availability or connection quality ) .",

    "however , a particular aspect of   is that a software module at the   continuously monitors all the   and probes the communication channels looking for access points to connect to .",
    "when there are no access points for a specific   in the current area , keeping that interface active has no practical benefit and negatively affects the   battery duration @xcite .    in this paper",

    "we describe a prototype implementation of the oracle based on a software daemon which periodically queries the wigle web service  @xcite to locate wifi networks within the current   location .    to evaluate the impact of the oracle on connection availability , power consumption and throughput , we define a performance model based on   with rewards .",
    "the model allows us to efficiently analyze the system in different scenarios ; such analysis would be impractical using conventional measurement - based techniques .",
    "results show that   enhanced with the oracle can significantly reduce the power consumption of the  , with just a marginal reduction of availability and throughput with respect to the classic  .",
    "we believe that the performance model is useful by itself , as it can be easily extended to describe multiple alternative implementations of the oracle , allowing `` what - if '' analyses to be carried out efficiently .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",

    "[ sec : prototype ] we describe an initial prototype implementation of the oracle based on the wigle service .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] describes the markov model exploited to analyze the approach .",
    "such model is evaluated in section  [ sec : eval ] . finally , concluding remarks are given in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the idea behind the basic   mechanism is simple : during transmission and reception , the   can use all the available   simultaneously , differentiating the choice of the actual   on a datagram - by - datagram basis .",
    "this is carried out transparently to both the application running in the   and its peer at the  ; thus , applications can continue to employ classic end - to - end application - layer protocols such as tcp regardless of  .    in order to let the data flow through different  , and deliver the related contents as a single flow to the application ,",
    "additional software components are needed .",
    "specifically , requires the _ abps client proxy _ and the _ abps server proxy _ ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "the client proxy runs on the   and maintains the seamless multi - path communication channel between the   and the server proxy running on the  .",
    "the server proxy operates as a relay between the   and the  , i.e.  it collects all the datagrams coming from the   via different  , and sends them to the application running on the   ( application which is unaware of the presence of the   server proxy ) .      the   uses multiple   at the same time , and assumes that all of them are always active ( although possibly not always connected to an  ) .",
    "this ensures maximum connection availability  @xcite , and in some cases the use of can even reduce the power consumption with respect to a classic sip based approach  @xcite .",
    "however , it remains true that the monitor at the   client proxy continuously probes the communication channels looking for new access points to connect to .",
    "when there are no access points available in the current area , this procedure is useless and wastes energy , which is a particularly serious issue for battery - powered mobile devices . to avoid such undesired situation , we need some component ( the `` oracle '' ) providing information on the available access points for a given  , without explicitly probing the communication channel . if the oracle reports that , for some  , no access point will be available for a sufficiently long period of time , than that   can be safely switched off . on the other hand ,",
    "if the oracle detects that the   is entering an area where access points are available , the   can be reactivated .      before describing how the oracle may be implemented ,",
    "let us focus in detail on how the oracle can be used by considering a practical scenario .",
    "we start by observing that most current smartphones are typically equipped with both a wifi and a 3 g   ( e.g.  umts ) . in general , 2g/3 g network coverage is quite ubiquitous , while wifi access points tend to be concentrated within densely populated areas ( e.g. , city centers ) . on the other hand , wifi provides better bandwidth , lower latency and lower energy consumption  @xcite , therefore umts networks should always be used as a fallback when no usable wifi connection is available .",
    "however , if the   is entering an area where the wifi connection is likely to be available for a short time only ( e.g. , because the   is approaching an isolated access point ) , switching off the umts   would not be a good idea since that connection will be needed again in a short time . on the other hand ,",
    "if the   is entering an area where wifi coverage is guaranteed for a sufficiently long time , then it is reasonable to switch umts off in order to save energy .",
    "we assume that the oracle has a list of available wifi access points in the current area ; also , the oracle knows the current position of the  , and can also infer the future destination of the node ( see section  [ sec : prototype ] for a possible implementation ) . algorithm",
    "[ alg : oracle ] describes the high level behavior of the oracle .",
    "based on the list of available wifi networks , the oracle generates one of these events :    * : this event is generated with no wifi access point is available ; therefore , the wifi   can be turned off so that connectivity is provided by the 2g/3 g network only ( lines [ alg : wifi_down_begin][alg : wifi_down_end ] ) .",
    "* : this event is generated with a wifi connection is going to be available for a short period of time ; in this case both the umts and wifi   are activated ( lines [ alg : abps_begin][alg : abps_end ] ) . * : this event is generated when a wifi connection is going to be available for a longer period of time ; in this case the   can safely switch off umts ( lines [ alg : umts_down_begin][alg : umts_down_end ] ) .    * upon * [ alg : wifi_down_begin ] @xmath0 @xmath1 [ alg : wifi_down_end ] * upon * [ alg : abps_begin ] @xmath2 @xmath1 [ alg : abps_end ] * upon * [ alg : umts_down_begin ] @xmath2 @xmath3 [ alg : umts_down_end ]    the events ( and associated new system configuration ) generated by the oracle is exploited by the   client proxy as shown in algorithm  [ alg : client ] .",
    "when a given   is active , based on the oracle prediction , and if an access point is detected for that  , then the client proxy starts a setup procedure to activate a connection and exploit it . upon successful connection setup ,",
    "the client proxy includes that interface in a list of   available to transmit data .",
    "when a connection drops , the associated   is removed from the list of active interfaces .",
    "based on this choice on the   to use , the communication between the   and its   is as follows .",
    "the client proxy intercepts and manages data coming from / to the application ( lines [ alg : comm_start][alg : comm_end ] ) . when there is data to transmit , the client sends those data to the server proxy via the preferred   in use . as multiple networks",
    "can be used during the communication , it is possible that the transmitted datagrams are received out of order . to this end , a sequence numbering scheme is used that enables the receiver server proxy to order the received datagrams and discard possible duplicates .",
    "finally , the client proxy exploits acks to identify if some datagram is to be re - transmitted .",
    "when a timeout for the reception of an ack occurs , the client proxy tries to retransmit that datagram through an alternative   among those active at that time .",

    "the server proxy operates basically as a relay between the   and its  . in practice , it is convenient to place the abps server proxy on a fixed node located outside any firewall and nat system",
    ". then , the   client and server proxies collaborate and adopt policies for load balancing and recovery , in order to maximize throughput and minimize loss rate and economic costs . in particular",

    "we have developed a prototype software module that is in charge of periodically querying the wigle web service to locate wifi networks within the area of the mobile user .",
    "is a submission - based web catalog of wireless networks  @xcite .",
    "such service provides location and information of wireless networks world - wide ; through a java application or a web browser it is possible to map , query and update the database .",
    "it allows to obtain statistics on the performance of networks , and for instance , it is possible to ask only for free ( or commercial ) networks .",
    "we have developed a python script in charge of retrieving from   a list of wifi access points available in the area of the  , based on its geographical position , together with some related information .    to obtain the actual position of the",
    ", a positioning system must be utilized , i.e.  gps .",
    "it has been shown that the power consumption related to the use of a gps is noticeably lower than that due to the use of a @xcite , but in any case the evaluation described in section  [ sec : eval ] explicitly takes into account the additional energy consumption of the gps module and the associating processing cycles .",
    "it is worth noticing that many apps running on users smartphones require the use of gps to locate points of interests  @xcite .",
    "hence , it would be reasonable to assume that gps is likely to be active anyway even without the execution of the oracle . in this case",
    ", the geolocalizaion does not introduce additional power consumption .",
    "we report a couple of examples in order to show the benefits of having an oracle that provides the list of wifi networks , and also some main related issues .",
    "let consider a mobile user that covers the path depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : zamboni ] .",
    "the path is via zamboni in bologna ( italy ) , the main street in the city center where several departments of the university of bologna are located . in this area",
    "there are many active wifi access points .",
    "in particular , there are two main networks available for students , i.e.  the almawifi network , which is the main wifi network for all students , faculty members and employees of the university of bologna , and the iperbole civic network , available to all citizens . for each point in the path",
    ", the oracle provides a list of available access points . for the sake of a clearer presentation , we report only the essid of the access points with the best signal in six main points of the path , i.e.  those corresponding to a square .",
    "the red line in the figure corresponds to the area in the path where there is a network coverage provided by the almawifi network ; the green line corresponds to the part of the path that is covered by some access points of the iperbole network .",
    "other networks are available in the network coverage of a single access point .",
    "this example allows us to make some important considerations . knowing that a main part of the area is covered by a single wifi network ( almawifi ) , the network manager of the   might decide to switch off its umts interface .",
    "obviously , during the path the mobile terminal will perform horizontal handover through different access points of the same network , but this is accomplished at the datalink layer , transparently to the transport and application layers . then , once the user becomes in proximity of the end of the almawifi network coverage , the umts interface should be activated , so as to allow the   to exploit that interface during the handover from a wifi network to another one , or if no wifi networks are available or open to the user .        fig .",
    "[ fig : margherita ] shows a different path , starting from giardini margherita , the main park in bologna , and then straight to via murri , a street originating from the entrance of the park . in this case , the oracle reports that there are private networks only ( we do not show them in the picture ) ; moreover , the access points are located at the beginning and the end of the path .",
    "apparently , no wifi networks are available in the middle of the path . in this context",
    ", the best strategy is to keep the umts   always active ; the wifi interface can be switched on when the   is in proximity of the beginning and the end of the path , so that it can probe the available networks and see if these networks are open and available .",
    "in this section we describe a performance model for   with oracle ; the model is based on markov chains with rewards , and extends previous works on modeling the plain   mechanism  @xcite .",

    "<S> always best packet switching ( abps ) is a novel approach for wireless communications that enables mobile nodes , equipped with multiple network interface cards ( nics ) , to dynamically determine the most appropriate nic to use . using abps , a mobile node can seamlessly switch to a different nic in order to get better performance , without causing communication interruptions at the application level . to make this possible , </S>",
    "<S> nics are kept always active and a software monitor constantly probes the channels for available access points . </S>",
    "<S> while this ensures maximum connection availability , considerable energy may be wasted when no access points are available for a given nic . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we address this issue by investigating the use of an `` oracle '' able to provide information on network availability . </S>",
    "<S> this allows to dynamically switch on / off nics based on reported availability , thus reducing the power consumption . </S>",
    "<S> we present a markov model which allows us to estimate the impact of the oracle on the abps mechanism : results show that significant reduction in energy consumption can be achieved with minimal impact on connection availability . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude by describing a prototype implementation of the oracle based on web services and geolocalization . </S>"
