    "the representation of a knot group in the group of isometries of a geometric manifold is important in order to obtain invariants of the knot and also in order to relate geometric structures with the knot .    in @xcite the varieties @xmath6 and @xmath7 of c - representations and affine c - representations ( resp . ) of a two - generator group in a quaternion algebra are defined .",
