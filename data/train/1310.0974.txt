    "in fact we have a flow @xmath179 for ( [ new ] ) , but we need to be careful because we are not exactly on the whole line and so this quantity is not defined for all  @xmath180 .",
    "in the preceding result , we assumed that the condition @xmath60 was true for all @xmath46 .",
    "we want here to take into account possible critical points .",
    "however , since we only assume that @xmath181 , we can not define critical points ( of the hamiltonian ) as points where @xmath12 vanishes ( the usual notion when the flow is continuous ) .",
    "in some sense , critical points mean for us all those points where @xmath60 is not true .",
    "in fact , this yields a `` larger '' set of critical points .",
    "our first result is the following    if @xmath12 satisfies @xmath60 everywhere in @xmath9 except on a set of isolated points , then the ( r ) hypothesis holds .",
    "without loss of generality we may assume that @xmath182 , that @xmath60 holds everywhere except at the origin @xmath75 and that @xmath183 .",

    "we conclude that @xmath199 for all @xmath189 .",
    "hence @xmath22 is a renormalized solution .",
    "the above result , of course , does not allow for many critical points .",

    "then , @xmath434 . according to what we proved above , we know that @xmath435 . now ,",
    "if we choose @xmath436,and write @xmath419 as above , we know that @xmath405 and @xmath406 are lebesgue s point of @xmath296 with @xmath437 and @xmath438 . then necessarily , @xmath439 and @xmath74 is strictly increasing in a neighboorhood of @xmath406 because it is a lebesgue s point .",
    "since we may make the same argument near @xmath405 , we have then shown the existence of @xmath440 as stated in the lemma .",
    "to solve ( [ cov1])-([cov2 ] ) on @xmath414 we use the change of variable @xmath441 where @xmath102 is a primitive of @xmath410 from @xmath414 to @xmath172 .",

    "hence , the solutions are of the form @xmath453 and @xmath454 with @xmath315 and @xmath318 belonging to @xmath455 .",
    "but we have not used yet the fact that ( [ ncov1 ] ) is true on [ a , b ] .",
    "this tells us formally that @xmath456 when @xmath457 and @xmath458 when @xmath459 .",
    "this can be justified .",
    "indeed , let us assume that @xmath459 and let we choose some @xmath460 , an @xmath461 and @xmath462 increasing such that @xmath463 for @xmath464 and some @xmath465 for @xmath466 .",
    "we use @xmath467 as a test function in ( [ ncov1 ] ) .",
    "we then obtain @xmath468 when @xmath433 , the first integral goes to @xmath425 .",
    "the second integral goes to @xmath469 .",
    "since it holds for all @xmath470 , we obtain that @xmath471 .",
    "we can prove similary that @xmath472 if @xmath473 .",

    "of course , it should be understood in sense of functions defined almost everywhere , but here it does not raise any difficulty and we will omit to specify it afterwards . using the boundary condition @xmath471 , we see that @xmath315 and @xmath318 are determined in @xmath477 .",
    "and the condition @xmath478 determines @xmath315 and @xmath318 in @xmath479 .",
    "if we continue to use this symmetry argument further , we see that @xmath315 and @xmath318 are uniquely determined in @xmath27 , provided we know them in @xmath172 ( we remark here that it is not the case if one of the boundary counditions is missing , as it is the case when @xmath480 or @xmath481 and the assumption of non - integrability on @xmath74 is not satisfied).then , for every intial condition ( on @xmath475 and @xmath476 ) in @xmath18 , there exists a unique solution to the system ( [ ncov1])-([ncov2 ] ) . and in view of the form of those solutions , we see that they are renormalized ones .",
