    "the role of quantum superpositions in irreversible chemical reactions , in particular electron transfer reactions @xcite , has received little attention .",
    "the specific question we will here address is this : to first - order reaction kinetics , can there be quantum superpositions between reactants and reaction products of an electron transfer reaction ?",
    "most if not all electron transfer reactions are known to occur in two steps , as shown in fig.[et ] , depicting the potential curves of the reactants and the products : ( 1 ) the electron tunnels from the initial state @xmath0 into an intermediate state @xmath1 , which is a vibrational excited state of the product , the ground state of which is @xmath2 .",
    "( 2 ) the excited state @xmath1 decays to the ground state @xmath2 , with the emission of a photon or a phonon .",
    "this decay usually takes place at a rate much faster than the first step , so it is the latter that mostly determines the total reaction rate .",
    "most works on electron transfer deal with calculating the rate of this first step @xcite .",
    "moreover , relevant considerations @xcite of quantum coherence have considered , again , this first step , and of course have appeared in the much broader context of chemical reactions @xcite . to our knowledge , however , the specific question we defined , i.e. whether the reactant state can be coherently coupled to the _ final _ product state in electron transfer reactions has not been addressed so far .",
    "this question can be rephrased : can states of the form @xmath3 be physically realized _ to first - order reaction kinetics _ ?",
    "the intuitive answer is negative , because of the existence of the intermediate states @xmath1 : a substantial amplitude for the product state @xmath2 would translate to an equally suppressed amplitude of the intermediate @xmath1 and thus a negligible amplitude of the reactant state @xmath0 . here",
    "we are going to prove that the intuitive answer is indeed correct .",
    "in retrospect , this might seem to be an obvious statement .    however , it ca nt be that obvious after all , for the following reasons . the seemingly innocuous question we will here address is directly related to understanding the fundamental quantum dynamics of spin - dependent recombination reactions of radical - ion pairs @xcite , which have recently received a lot of attention from the quantum information science perspective @xcite . in particular , the traditional theoretical description of spin - selective radical - ion - pair ( rp ) reactions has been questioned , and new approaches have been put forward by the authors in @xcite , who introduced quantum measurements as conceptually important for understanding the quantum dynamics of these reactions .",
    "these papers have led to an ongoing debate @xcite which at the least illuminates the richness of the topic in terms of the quantum mechanical concepts involved .",
    "currently there exist at least three different theories , all purported to be derived from first principles , attempting to describe rp reactions .",
    "the traditional theory , sometimes called the haberkorn master equation @xcite , was explicitly derived , for the first time to our knowledge , by ivanov et al .",
    "@xcite , and supported by purtov along similar lines of thought @xcite .",
    "both of these papers , however , start out from this seemingly innocent assumption : the existence of quantum superpositions between the reactants ( the radical - ion - pair state ) and the reaction products ( the neutral product state ) of an electron transfer reaction .",
    "furthermore , the considerations in @xcite also start out from the assumption that the radical - ion - pair state can be coherently coupled to the neutral product state .",
    "thus , it is fair to say that what we are going to prove here is not an obvious , but a rather subtle physical statement regarding electron - transfer reactions in general , and radical - ion - pair reactions in particular .    in section",
    "ii we will rigorously prove our main assertion , namely that to _ first order reaction kinetics _ , the product state of an electron transfer reaction can not be coherently coupled to the reactant state , exactly due to the existence of intermediate states . in section iii",
    "we will elaborate on the physical consequences of neglecting these states , or stated equivalently , treating rp reactions by the haberkorn master equation .",
    "we will show that according to the latter , the evolution of the entropy of the rp spin state exhibits an unphysical behaviour , not evidenced by the other two theories based on quantum measurement considerations .",
    "we will consider a simplified version of the problem keeping all the ingredients that are essential for the basic physics .",
    "reducing the problem to an electronic one , i.e. neglecting the nuclear degrees of freedom , we depict in fig .",
    "[ levels ] the energy levels of the system comprised of the single reactant state @xmath0 , a manifold of intermediate states @xmath4 to which the electron can tunnel from @xmath0 , and the single product state @xmath2 to which @xmath4 can decay by the emission of a photon or a phonon . letting @xmath2",
    "define the zero of the energy scale , the unperturbed hamiltonian of the system is _ 0=_ra_r^a_r+_i_p^*_ia_p^*_i^a_p^*_i+__a_^a _ the sum over @xmath5 denotes all modes of the photons ( phonons ) with frequency @xmath6 due to energy conservation .",
    "we will use fermionic operators to denote the creation ( @xmath7 ) or annihilation ( @xmath8 ) of a single occupation of the relevant states .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath9 are denoted by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 are occupations of the reactant , the intermediate and the product states , respectively , and similarly @xmath12 denotes the occupation of the photon state with wave vector @xmath5 .",
    "for example , the initial state is @xmath13 , whereas the final state is one among the states @xmath14 , where @xmath5 runs over all photon wave vectors satisfying energy conservation .",
    "these states will be collectively denoted by @xmath2 , i.e. without reference to the index @xmath5 .",
    "the tunneling hamiltonian coupling @xmath0 to @xmath4 is simply @xmath15 finally , the decay hamiltonian coupling @xmath4 to the radiation ( or phonon ) reservoir and leading to the ground state @xmath2 is @xmath16     couples the `` reactants '' state @xmath0 with the manifold of excited states @xmath1 , which then radiatively decay to the ground state @xmath2 , the `` product '' state.,width=6 ]    the coupling constants @xmath17 readily result from the quantum theory of light - matter interaction , and are @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the volume in which the radiation field modes are defined , and @xmath20 the relevant matrix element for the transition @xmath21 .",
    "the total interaction hamiltonian is @xmath22 .",
    "it is worth considering two simple cases before proceeding : ( i ) neglecting the presence of @xmath2 and considering only the tunneling transition @xmath23 , moreover assuming that @xmath24 for all @xmath25 , and using fermi s golden rule , it is found within @xmath26-order perturbation theory that this transition s rate is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the density of states of the @xmath29-manifold calculated at the energy of the reactants @xmath30 .",
    "( ii ) neglecting the presence of @xmath0 and considering only the radiative transition @xmath31 , moreover assuming that @xmath32 for all @xmath25 , and again using fermi s golden rule , it is found within @xmath26-order perturbation theory that this transition s rate is @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the density of states of the radiation field calculated at the energy of the excited intermediates @xmath35 .",
    "it is noted that in realistic systems it usually is @xmath36 .",
    "we will now move to consider the action of @xmath37 on the entire system using time - dependent perturbation theory .",
    "the initial state @xmath38 will evolve to @xmath39 .",
    "to @xmath40-order perturbation theory it is @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "it is clear that within @xmath26-order perturbation theory , @xmath37 can couple @xmath0 to @xmath4 through @xmath43 , but not to @xmath2 , hence @xmath44 .",
    "let s now move to @xmath45-order perturbation theory , where a possible coupling between @xmath0 and @xmath2 appears through the product @xmath46 .",
    "assuming that the reactant and intermediate states are non - degenerate , i.e. @xmath47 it follows from @xmath45-order time - dependent perturbation theory ( setting @xmath48 ) that @xmath49\\sum_{i}{{{\\cal v}_{pi}{\\cal v}_{ir}}\\over { \\omega_{p^{*}_{i}}-\\omega_{r}}}\\nonumber\\\\ & = { { it}\\over \\hbar^{2}}\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}}e^{i\\delta_{\\mathbf{k}}t/2}{\\rm sinc}\\big[\\delta_{\\mathbf{k}}t/2\\big]\\sum_{i}{{\\lambda_{i}c_{i,\\mathbf{k}}}\\over { \\omega_{p^{*}_{i}}-\\omega_{r}}}\\label{c2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as the manifold of intermediate states is a dense quasi - continuum , and as mentioned before , @xmath24 and @xmath50 for all @xmath25 can be taken out of the sum , moreover since @xmath51 is an odd function of @xmath52 , it follows that @xmath53 . even in the case of resonant tunneling ,",
    "i.e. supposing the existence of one intermediate state @xmath1 resonant with @xmath0 , it follows that @xmath54 where the second equality follows in the limit @xmath55 imposed by energy conservation .",
    "the phase @xmath56 will average @xmath57 to zero . even if @xmath58 identically , this contribution is not first - order in the reaction kinetics , but third , so it can be neglected .",
    "now it is also clear that coherently coupling @xmath2 to @xmath0 is possible only within even - order perturbation theory , hence the first non - zero term in the sought after quantum superposition appears at @xmath59-order perturbation theory , easily found to be negligible .",
    "there is a very transparent way to summarize the above results with feynman diagrams , shown in fig.[feyn ] .",
    "not taking into account the intermediate states @xmath1 ,",
    "i.e. supposing a physically absent direct coherent coupling between @xmath0 and @xmath2 , is depicted by the diagram shown in fig.[feyn]a . taking the full level dynamics into account",
    ", we have shown that the @xmath45-order perturbation theory diagram depicted in fig.[feyn]b has a zero amplitude due to the energy - odd denominator . the first non - zero amplitude for coherently coupling @xmath0 to @xmath2 results from the @xmath59-order diagram of fig.[feyn]c .",
    "in this diagram , the intermediate state @xmath1 emits a virtual photon that is re - absorbed by the produced product state , leading again to the intermediate manifold before the actual product is generated .",
    "finally , the electron transfer reaction actually proceeds within first order reaction kinetics through two consecutive _ real _ transitions , i.e. there is a _",
    "real _ transition from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , followed by another _ real _ transition from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "we symbolize this with the diagram shown in fig.[feyn]d , where the dashed line crossing the @xmath1 states is supposed to mean that the @xmath1 states are really , as opposed to virtually , populated by the real transitions from @xmath0 .    ) coherent coupling between reactants and products , the amplitude of which is zero .",
    "( c ) the first non - zero amplitude comes from this @xmath59-order diagram .",
    "( d ) within frist - order reaction kinetics , the reaction proceeds by a real transition from @xmath0 to @xmath1 ( indicated by the dashed line ) , followed by another real transition from @xmath1 to @xmath2.,width=6 ]",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the authors in @xcite and @xcite derived the traditional master equation of spin chemistry treating the recombination process according to the diagram in fig .",
    "[ feyn]a , i.e. by neglecting the intermediate states @xmath1 .",
    "this is an example of what field theory calls an `` effective theory '' .",
    "there are many examples in physics , especially in nuclear physics @xcite , where effective theories are indeed a good approximation , destined however , to fail in some regime of the relevant parameter space .",
    "for example , weak interactions were initially described by the effective fermi theory , according to which the neutron decays as shown in fig.[weak]a .",
    "after the development of electroweak theory , the relevant feynman diagram was found to include the intermediate w@xmath60 boson ( fig.[weak]b ) . the fermi theory was a good low energy approximation , plagued , however , by several problems , such as an electron - neutrino scattering cross section tending to infinity at high energies .",
    "this and other problems were remedied by the full electroweak theory .",
    "similarly , the traditional master equation of spin chemistry is a very good approximation , plagued however , with several conceptual problems .",
    "we will now turn to those .",
    "we consider a very simple example of a radical - pair consisting of just two unpaired electrons and no nuclear spins .",
    "we furthermore set to zero all magnetic interactions and consider a single recombination channel , e.g. the singlet , with @xmath61 being the recombination rate .",
    "we take as an initial state the maximally coherent state @xmath62 , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the two - electron singlet and zero - projection triplet state , respectively .",
    "what is physically obvious is that a fraction of the radical - ion pairs , initially in the state @xmath67 will recombine through the singlet channel , while the rest will remain locked in the non - reactive triplet state forever ( we took @xmath68 ) .",
    "indeed this is what the prediction of all three theories is , albeit with a quantitative difference of what exactly this fraction is @xcite .",
    "this difference is immaterial for the current consideration .",
    "what is also expected on physical grounds is the fact that while at the beginning and the end the state of the radical - ion pairs is pure , i.e. at @xmath69 we have a pure singlet state and at @xmath70 we have a pure triplet , during intermediate times we have a mixture of pure states . hence one would expect that the von - neuman entropy @xmath71 , where @xmath65 is the density matrix describing the two - electron spin state , would start from zero , acquire a non - zero value at intermediate times , and",
    "return to zero .",
    "in fig.[comparison]a we compare the predictions of the three master equations .",
    "it is clear that the two theories based on the quantum measurement approach to the recombination of rps predict the above described behavior expected on general physical grounds .",
    "in contrast , @xmath72 at all times according to the traditional theory . the aforementioned problem of the haberkorn master equation can be traced to the absence of intermediate states in the theoretical paradigm underlying the traditional theory .",
    "the presence of such states leads to a fundamental and unavoidable s - t dephasing within first order reaction kinetics through feynman diagrams like the ones presented in @xcite .",
    "concluding , we have explored the physical existence of quantum superpositions between reactants and products in electron transfer reactions and connected the result to the fundamental quantum dynamics of spin chemistry reactions ."
