    "the solar magnetic cycle is a process that takes the sun through subsequent periods of high ( maximum ) and low ( minimum ) activity . since the pioneering work of @xcite",
    ", there has been a continuous effort to understand the mechanisms that keep it going and define its properties ( see a review by * ? ? ?",
    "most of this effort has focused on understanding the periods of highest activity ( solar maximum ) . however , this focus shifted after the arrival of the unexpectedly deep minimum of solar cycle 23 , in which record lows were measured across the board in solar activity indices and solar wind properties .",
    "one of the most direct proxies of solar activity , and the one most commonly used to understand cycle variability , is the presence of sunspots on the photosphere .",
    "one of its main advantages is that reliable sunspot records exist that span more than a century .",
    "sunspot groups are associated with bipolar magnetic regions ( bmrs ) , that are believed to originate from an underlying large - scale toroidal field that is critical for the evolution of the solar cycle ( see a review by * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , thanks to the systematic orientation and tilt of bmrs , their emergence and decay of seem to be the primary mechanism that regenerates the poloidal field from which the solar cycle can start again @xcite , a process known as the babcock - leighton mechanism ( bl ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one of the main questions that has been in the forefront of our minds since the arrival of the deep minimum of cycle 23 , is : is there a baseline for solar magnetism beyond which activity indices and solar wind properties can not be any weaker ?",
    "@xcite .",
    "both the length of the sunspot record and the direct connection between sunspots and the solar cycle make it an ideal proxy with which to probe this question .",
    "however , distilling information out of sunspot ( and bmr ) properties is non - trivial due to the large variability observed in their properties ( area , flux , and tilt and time , latitude , and longitude of emergence ) .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to introduce a new technique for studying the cycle dependence of sunspot properties ( specifically sunspot group area ) and demonstrate how powerful it is for contextualizing the extended minimum of cycle 23 .    in order to better explain this new approach ,",
    "we begin with a brief overview of the traditional approaches for binning sunspot and bmr properties to study the solar cycle ( by date , by cycle , and by cycle phase ; see section [ sec_time_bin ] ) .",
    "then we discuss why these approaches are sub - optimal when the object of interest is the sunspots themselves , and we define activity level and how to use it to bin sunspot data ( see section [ sec_al_bin ] ) . in section [ sec_data ] , we introduce our two databases and how to combine them by taking advantage of their statistical properties followed by our statistical model and our methods for fitting the data and assessing their relative performance ( see section [ sec_math ] ) . in section [ sec_dis_free ]",
    "we separate our data according to activity level and fit each activity level bin separately .",
    "we also show how the area distribution related to small structures is independent of activity level . in section [ sec_dis_con ]",
    "we show how the area distribution related to bmrs is strongly dependent on activity level and re - define our statistical model to take advantage of this relationship . in section [ sec_model_sel ]",
    "we demonstrate quantitatively , that an activity - level - dependent statistical model is the best of all the models proposed in this paper for characterizing our data . in section [ sec_time_dep ] , we take advantage of this model to better understand the extended minimum of cycle 23 and put it in the context of the last 12 cycles . in section [ sec_dynamo ]",
    "we discuss whether the existence of a composite distribution arises from different components of the dynamo ( small - scale versus global ) , or whether an alternative interpretation of the results is necessary .",
    "we finish with a summary and conclusions in section [ sec_conclusions ] .     +   +   +",
    "given that the solar cycle is a continuously evolving transient process , time has been the traditional primary focus of statistical analyses of sunspot and bmr properties .",
    "this means that comparative studies break down and compartmentalize data into chunks defined by when they occur .",
    "this kind of binning is illustrated in figures [ fig_bfly_bin](a ) and ( b ) , showing vertical markers that break down our data into separate cycles .",
    "there are essentially three ways of binning data in time ; to illustrate them , in this section we make a very limited review of studies using each type ( which should not be considered comprehensive ) .",
    "example studies are chosen specifically to highlight the advantages of each approach .",
    "the most straightforward way of time binning is to separate data into specific time intervals ( by day , month , or year or by carrington rotation ) .",
    "this kind of binning is the most natural form of data exploration ( see , for example , the pioneering studies by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it is still widely used today .",
    "it is particularly powerful for searching for evidence of long - term trends ( spanning timescales longer than the solar cycle itself ) .",
    "more recent examples of this kind of binning are the thought - provoking papers by @xcite who reported a decrease in the average magnetic field of sunspots since 1998 ; they speculated that , if this trend continued , sunspots would become very rare by 2025 .",
    "very good examples of how best to use this kind of binning are the responses to penn & livingston by @xcite and @xcite where , using data going back to 1920 , they demonstrate that there is no apparent long - term trend in the evolution of the average properties of sunspots ; there is simply a cyclic modulation .",
    "the second way of binning data involves grouping data according to the cycle to which they belong .",
    "this kind of binning is very good for identifying significant changes between different cycles .",
    "some examples of this kind of binning are the papers by @xcite who looked at the decay rate of sunspots , @xcite who studied variations in sunspot group tilt angles and joy s law , and @xcite , who examined changes in sunspot area between cycles 22 and 23 .",
    "this type of time binning truly excels when used for studying the physical mechanisms responsible for sustaining and propagating the solar cycle .",
    "an excellent example of this kind of work was performed by @xcite who by looking at cyclic averages of tilt angles , found a correlation between weighted averages of sunspot group properties during a cycle and the amplitude of the following cycle ( not to be confused with the reported same - cycle negative correlation between the amplitude of a cycle and tilt averages ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this result has been further expanded by @xcite who demonstrated that this connection exists because the average properties of bmrs determine the strength of the poloidal field at the end of the solar cycle .",
    "together they represent observational evidence in favor of the bl mechanism and our current understanding of the solar cycle .",
    "the last type of time binning we will review here is binning according to cycle phase .",
    "this involves either choosing specific phases of the solar cycle ( rising , maximum , declining , and minimum phases ) , or binning the data relative to its position within a particular solar cycle .",
    "some examples of this kind of binning are the papers by @xcite who studied the dependence of umbral and penumbral brightness on the solar cycle , @xcite who examined daily variations of tilt angles during the rising and declining phases of cycle 23 ; and @xcite who looked at maximum magnetic field and umbral / penumbral areas during the different phases of cycle 23 .",
    "this type of time binning is very powerful for characterizing the general properties of the solar cycle .",
    "an excellent example of this kind of work was performed by @xcite , who performed a very detailed quantitative characterization of the relationship between cycle amplitude , cycle phase , and the properties of active latitudes ( i.e. , the shape , location , and width of the wings in the butterfly diagram ) .",
    "taking advantage of this characterization , they laid a solid foundation for the construction of synthetic data sets based solely on sunspot number , which can be used to drive surface flux transport simulations .",
    "although there is undeniable value in using time to bin sunspot and bmr data ( when the objective is to study and characterize the solar cycle ) , this kind of binning is sub - optimal for studying how the evolution of the solar cycle changes the properties of bmrs and their associated sunspots .",
    "the problem is conceptual : a single bmr and its associated sunspot group is believed to be the photospheric manifestation of a buoyant flux tube .",
    "these tubes take roughly a month to travel through the convection zone @xcite and have a typical lifetime ( after eruption ) of about a month . considering that the solar cycle involves decadal timescales",
    ", this means that from the perspective of each bmr , the magnetic cycle is a quasi - static process ( i.e. , time - independent during a bmrs life cycle ) .",
    "it is commonly believed that the total number of bmrs and their combined flux is a direct indication of the strength of the underlying toroidal field .",
    "furthermore , this magnetic field strongly determines the resulting properties of the emerged bmrs ( see a review by * ? ? ?",
    "_ we propose that the amplitude of the solar cycle at any specific moment in time ( which we assume to be directly related to the characteristics of the underlying toroidal field ) , is the true quantity determining the statistical properties of sunspots and bmrs _ , and that the time dependence of these properties is simply a direct consequence of the evolution of this toroidal magnetic field .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]     in order to evaluate the relationship between the different fitting parameters of the composite pdf , we use spearman s rank correlation coefficient ( @xmath0 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be described using a monotonic function .",
    "the results are displayed in figures [ fig_fits1](c ) , ( f)-(i ) .",
    "we find no correlation between activity level and the parameters characterizing the weibull component of the composite pdf  with @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the factor ( @xmath3 ) and shape parameter ( @xmath4 ) , respectively . on the other hand , the parameters that characterize the log - normal component",
    "are found to be correlated with activity level with a high degree of statistical significance ( above 98% )  with @xmath5 and @xmath6 for the logarithmic mean ( @xmath7 ) and the logarithmic variance ( @xmath8 ) respectively .",
    "we find a moderate correlation between the proportionality constant that blends these distributions together ( @xmath9 ) with @xmath10 .",
    "the apparent independence between activity level and the parameters characterizing the weibull component of the composite pdf is in agreement with the results of @xcite who found essentially no dependence between the distribution of ephemeral regions and the solar cycle .",
    "furthermore , considering the values that these parameters assume , and the large width of their 95% confidence intervals ( see figures [ fig_fits1](c ) and ( f ) ) , it is clear that leaving them unconstrained is being used by our fitting algorithm to over - fit the data .    to address this",
    ", we re - fit our data with the additional constraint that the parameters characterizing the weibull component must be the same for all activity levels .",
    "we do this by maximizing total average log - likelihood ( @xmath11 ) for all activity levels : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is our composite pdf function ( see equation ( [ eq_mix ] ) ) ; the index @xmath14 denotes each activity level bin , the index @xmath15 denotes each data point in a bin ; @xmath4 and @xmath3 ( the weibull parameters ) are free to vary but must be the same for all activity level bins ; and @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 ( the log - normal parameters and the constant of proportionality ) are allowed be different for different bins .    as can be seen in figure [ fig_fits2](c ) , @xmath11 has a single global maximum located at @xmath19 and @xmath20hem .",
    "these values are well within the 95% confidence intervals previously found for @xmath4 and @xmath3 in both the unconstrained fit ( see figures [ fig_fits1](c ) and ( f ) ) , and the fit to the unbinned rgo / kmas set ( see table [ tab_mix ] ) .    after forcing @xmath4 and @xmath3 to have the same value for all activity level bins",
    ", there is a remarkable tightening of the relationship between activity level and the remaining pdf parameters ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , which can be seen both qualitatively and as a significant improvement in the spearman s rank correlation coefficients .",
    "we perform a @xmath21 fit to this dependence using power functions ( see figures [ fig_fits2](g)-(i ) for fitting values ) , finding a reduced @xmath21 lower than unity in all cases .",
    "although in this work we fit these dependencies using power functions , due to their simplicity there are several functional forms that would fit the scatter plots equally well within the 95% confidence intervals ( for example logarithmic and exponential forms ) .",
    "the true characterization of these dependencies would involve a large amount of tests that is beyond the scope of this paper and will be performed in a later work .",

    "3 .   a different pdf for each activity level bin , but in which the values of @xmath4 and @xmath3 are forced to be equal for every bin ( see section [ sec_dis_con ] ) .",
    "4 .   a pdf with constant @xmath4 and @xmath3 , but in which @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 depend on activity level through power functions ( see equation ( [ eq_final ] ) ) .    for this purpose",
    ", we use the aic ( described in detail in appendix [ sec_aic ] ) , and the results are shown in table [ tab_aic ] . a comparison between log - likelihood and dof ( columns 3 and 4 , respectively )",
    ", shows that log - likelihood is the main factor determining aic ( not the dof ; see equation ( [ eq_aic ] ) ) .",
    "the reason is that our data set has significantly more data points than the dof in each of our models .",
    "as expected , the worst fit corresponds to the pdf that does not depend on activity level ( defined in section [ sec_same_dis ] ) .",
    "this is followed by both our constrained and unconstrained fits binned by activity level ( defined in sections [ sec_dis_free ] and [ sec_dis_con ] , respectively ) .",
    "we find , with a very high degree of statistical significance , that the best model to fit our data is the unbinned pdf whose parameters depend analytically on activity level ( defined by equation ( [ eq_final ] ) ) .",
    "it is important to highlight that aic works only as a relative estimate .",
    "this means that it can not tell us whether equation ( [ eq_final ] ) characterizes the true mechanism that generated the observed data .",
    "instead , it allows us to rule out all the models proposed in this work ( with near certainty ) in favor of the model described by equation ( [ eq_final ] ) . taken together with the results of @xcite who fitted five more models to similar data ( including the model described in section [ sec_same_dis ] ) , we can take advantage of the relative nature of aic to rule those models out as well",
    ".     +   +   +",
    "as was shown in section [ sec_same_dis ] , we find the weibull component of the composite pdf to be independent of activity level .",
    "this result is in agreement with other studies arguing in favor of a magnetic baseline @xcite , since it suggests that small magnetic structures in the photosphere indeed arise from a cycle - independent process .",
    "however , the striking connection between the size - flux pdf and activity level ( demonstrated in section [ sec_dis_con ] ) , allows us to do more than that ; it allows us make a quantitative comparison of the depth of each minimum during the last 130 yr ( 12 solar cycles ) . for this purpose , we calculate the expected value of sunspot group area ( i.e. , the average size of magnetic structures ) as a function of activity level : @xmath28   = { } & \\int_{0}^{\\infty } x f[x;k,\\lambda,\\mu(al),\\sigma(al ) , c(al)]dx\\\\                      = { } & [ 1-c(al ) ] \\lambda \\gamma \\left(1+\\frac{1}{k } \\right)\\\\                           & + c(al)e^{\\mu(al)+\\frac{\\sigma^2(al)}{2 } } ,    \\end{aligned } \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the gamma function",
    ". this quantity can be used as a thermometer for solar magnetism , as it tells us the typical magnetic structure size that we can expect to see as a function of time .",
    "as it happens with the composite pdf , the expected value of the sunspot group area is also a linear combination of weibull ( second line , equation ( [ eq_exp_val ] ) ) and log - normal ( third line , equation ( [ eq_exp_val ] ) ) components .",
    "furthermore , almost all of the time dependence of the expected value can be attributed to the log - normal component .",
    "the consequence is that the magnetic baseline is defined by the weibull component and is only truly visible in those times in which the emergence of cycle - related bmrs shuts down .",
    "figure [ fig_time_dep](b ) shows the time evolution of the log - normal component of the expected sunspot area and how it contrasts with its weibull counterpart .",
    "note that there is a weak modulation of the weibull contribution to the expected value due to the fact that the proportionality constant ( @xmath9 ) by definition depends on activity level .",
    "we find that the log - normal contribution drops below its weibull counterpart in most hemispheric minima .",
    "using a notation where @xmath30 corresponds to the minimum between cycle n and cycle n+1 , the exceptions are 15.5n&s , 17n&s , 19.5n , 20.5n&s , 21.5n&s , and 22.5n&s ( note that most exceptions occur during the space age ) .",
    "this means that , from a hemispheric point of view , we have been able to observe that magnetic baseline .",
    "however , the results are different from a whole sun point of view .",
    "we calculate the whole sun expected value as a weighted average between the expected value of the northern and southern hemispheres . due to its strong correlation with sunspot numbers , for simplicity we use activity level as our weighting coefficient : @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are the whole sun , northern , and southern expected values , respectively , and al@xmath35 ( al@xmath36 ) is the activity level in the northern ( southern ) hemisphere .",
    "figure [ fig_time_dep](c ) shows the time evolution of the expected value for the whole sun ( including both log - normal and weibull components ) and the weibull baseline for comparison .",
    "the story is quite different ; there have been only two solar minima during the last 12 cycles in which observation of the baseline magnetism has been possible in both hemispheres simultaneously ( i.e. , for the whole sun ; 13.5 and 14.5 ) .",
    "apart from those , hemispheric asymmetries have conspired to raise the whole sun level above the baseline magnetism .",
    "one of the striking features evidenced in figure [ fig_time_dep](c ) is how different the minimum of cycle 23 is when compared to other minima during the space age ( 19.5 through 23.5 ) .",
    "it is no wonder why it seemed so unusual to us .",
    "this has important implications because the properties of the heliosphere , its current sheet , and the background solar wind are strongly determined at a global level .",
    "the fact that the minimum of cycle 23 had a very asymmetric current sheet is evidence that solar magnetism was not in its baseline state .",
    "based on this result , we infer that even though each hemisphere did reach the magnetic baseline , the minimum of cycle 23 was not as deep as it could have been .",
    "in our previous paper @xcite , we proposed that the existence of two populations of sunspot groups originated from separate contributions by the small - scale and global components of the dynamo . however , with the evolution of our understanding we feel that further clarification is necessary .",
    "we find strong evidence that the size - flux distribution has two components that are discriminated by size , and only the properties of the larger structures are modulated by the solar cycle .",
    "however , in spite of the fact that the properties of small pores are independent of the solar cycle , their latitude of appearance is still modulated by active latitudes ( as can be seen in figure ( [ fig_bfly_bin ] ) ) .",
    "this means that there must still be a connection between these structures and the cycle itself and that their formation can not be attributed solely to the small - scale component of the dynamo ( otherwise they would be observable all throughout the photosphere ) .",
    "a possible explanation is that these small structures arise from the re - processing of the decaying magnetic field of their large - scale counterparts and thus their relative numbers are governed by the properties of surface convection ( and only loosely by the amount of available decaying field ) . in this case",
    ", the magnetic baseline found in the previous section is contingent on the emergence of a minimum amount of large - scale structures and can not be taken as a hard lower limit for grand minima like the maunder minimum .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to make a further assessment of this connection without resorting to magnetic data . for this reason",
    ", we will look at this issue in more detail in future work involving magnetic structure catalogs compiled using soho / mdi and sdo / hmi data .",
    "in this work we have introduced a new way of binning sunspot group and bmr data with the purpose of better understanding the impact of the solar cycle on sunspot and bmr properties and how this defines the characteristics of the extended minimum of cycle 23 .",
    "this approach hinges critically on our current understanding of bmrs as the photospheric manifestation of emergent buoyant flux tubes arising from a large - scale underlying toroidal field .",
    "in particular , we assume that from the point of view of each active region , the solar cycle can be approximated as a quasi - static process .",
    "this means that the properties of sunspots and bmrs are completely determined by the strength of the underlying toroidal field and have no additional long - term dependencies . in other words",
    ", we are assuming that the statistical properties of sunspots and bmrs do not depend on cycle phase ( rising versus declining ; maximum versus minimum ) , but on how strong the cycle is at each particular moment ( something we refer to as activity level ) .",
    "in this work we build upon the results of @xcite , who found after analyzing 11 different databases , that the solar size - flux distribution is better characterized by a linear combination of weibull and log - normal distributions  where a pure weibull ( log - normal ) characterizes the distribution of structures with fluxes below ( above ) @xmath37mx ( @xmath38mx ) .",
    "after binning our data according to activity level , we fit this composite distribution to each separate bin and look at the dependence of each parameter on activity level .",
    "we find that the parameters that characterize the weibull component have no dependence on activity level .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of @xcite who found essentially no dependence between the distribution of ephemeral regions ( below @xmath39mx ) and the solar cycle .",
    "we propose that the structures characterized by the weibull component are what give the sun a magnetic baseline .    in stark contrast to the weibull component , we find a clear dependence between activity level and the parameters that characterize the log - normal component of the size - flux distribution ( which we fit using power functions ) .",
    "this supports the interpretation of @xcite , who proposed that the log - normal component is directly connected to the global component of the dynamo ( and the generation of bipolar active regions ) .    by taking advantage of our analytical characterization of the size - flux distribution and its dependence on activity level",
    ", we study the relative contribution of each component ( small - scale versus large - scale ) to solar magnetism . in order to do this ,",
    "we calculate the expected value of sunspot group areas and study its evolution with time .",
    "we find that from a hemispheric point of view , almost every solar minimum ( during the last 12 cycles ) reaches a point where the only contribution to magnetism comes from the small - scale component .",
    "however , due to asymmetries in cycle phase , this state is very rarely reached by both hemispheres at the same time ( according to our data , only during the minima of cycles 13 and 14 ) .",
    "there is no question that the extended minimum of cycle 23 is deeper than any other minimum of the space age .",
    "however , based on our results , we infer that even though each hemisphere did reach the magnetic baseline , from a heliospheric point of view the minimum of cycle 23 was not as deep as it could possibly be .",

    "<S> we use the amplitude of the cycle at any given moment ( something we refer to as activity level ) as a proxy for the strength of this deep - seated magnetic field .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that the sunspot size distribution is composed of two populations : one population of groups and active regions and a second population of pores and ephemeral regions . </S>",
    "<S> when fits are performed at periods of different activity level , only the statistical properties of the former population , the active regions , is found to vary .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we study the relative contribution of each component ( small - scale versus large - scale ) to solar magnetism . </S>",
    "<S> we find that when hemispheres are treated separately , almost every one of the past 12 solar minima reaches a point where the main contribution to magnetism comes from the small - scale component . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to asymmetries in cycle phase , this state is very rarely reached by both hemispheres at the same time . from this </S>",
    "<S> we infer that even though each hemisphere did reach the magnetic baseline , from a heliospheric point of view the minimum of cycle 23 was not as deep as it could have been . </S>"
