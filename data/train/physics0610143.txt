    "reciprocity , which was first found by lorentz at the end of 19th century , has a long history@xcite and has been derived in several formalisms .",
    "there are two typical reciprocal configurations in optical responses as shown in fig .",
    "the configurations in figs .",
    "[ fig1](a ) and [ fig1](b ) are transmission reciprocal and those in figs .",
    "[ fig1](a ) and [ fig1](c ) are reflection reciprocal . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we denote transmittance by @xmath0 and reflectance by @xmath1 ; the suffice k and @xmath2 stand for incident wavenumber vector and angle , respectively .",
    "the reciprocal configurations are obtained by symmetry operations on the incident light of the wavenumber vector : ( @xmath3 ) or ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "reciprocity on transmission means that @xmath5 , and that on reflection is expressed as @xmath6 , which is not intuitively obvious and is frequently surprising to students .",
    "the most general proof was published by petit in 1980,@xcite where reciprocal reflection as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is derived for asymmetric gratings such as an echelette grating . on the basis of the reciprocal relation for the solutions of the helmholtz equation",
    ", the proof showed that reciprocal reflection holds for periodic objects irrespective of absorption .",
    "it seems difficult to apply the proof to transmission because it would be necessary to construct solutions of maxwell equations that satisfy the boundary conditions at the interfaces of the incident , grating , and transmitted layers .",
    "the history of the literature on reciprocal optical responses has been reviewed in ref  .    since the 1950s , scattering problems regarding light , elementary particles , and so on",
    "have been addressed by using scattering matrix ( s - matrix ) . in the studies employing the s - matrix ,",
    "it is assumed that there is no absorption by the object .",
    "the assumption leads to the unitarity of the s - matrix and makes it possible to prove reciprocity .",
    "the reciprocal reflection of lossless objects was verified in this formalism.@xcite    in this paper we present a simple , direct , and general derivation of the reciprocal optical responses for transmission and reflection relying only on classical electrodynamics .",
    "we start from the reciprocal theorem described in sec .",
    "[ thm ] and derive the equation for zeroth order transmission and reflection coefficients in sec .  [ proof ] .",
    "the equation is essential to the reciprocity .",
    "a numerical and experimental example of reciprocity is presented in sec .",
    "[ example ] . the limitation and break down of reciprocal optical responses are also discussed .",
    "the reciprocal theorem has been proved in various fields , such as statistical mechanics , quantum mechanics , and electromagnetism.@xcite here we introduce the theorem for electromagnetism .    when two currents exist as in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and the induced electromagnetic ( em ) waves travel in linear and locally responding media in which @xmath7 and @xmath8 , then @xmath9 equation   is the reciprocal theorem in electromagnetism .",
    "the proof shown in ref .",
    "exploits plane waves and is straightforward . equation  ( [ reci ] ) is valid even for media with losses . the integrands take non - zero values at the position @xmath10 where currents exist , that is , @xmath11 . the theorem indicates the reciprocity between the two current sources @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) and the induced em waves @xmath14 which are observed at the position of the other source @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "in this section , we apply the reciprocal theorem to optical responses in both transmission and reflection configurations .",
    "first , we define the notation used in the calculations of the integrals in eq .",
    "( [ reci ] ) .",
    "an electric dipole oscillating at the frequency @xmath17 emits dipole radiation , which is detected in the far field .",
    "when a small dipole @xmath18 along the @xmath19 axis is located at the origin , it is written as @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes the unit vector along the @xmath19 axis and @xmath23 the magnitude of the dipole .",
    "the dipole in vacuum emits radiation , which in the far field is    @xmath24    where polar coordinates ( @xmath25 , @xmath2 , @xmath26 ) are used , a unit vector is given by @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . because the dipole @xmath18 is defined by @xmath29 and conservation of charge density is given by @xmath30 , we obtain the current @xmath31 associated with the dipole @xmath18 : @xmath32    consider two arrays of @xmath33 dipoles ( long but finite ) in the @xmath34 plane as shown in fig .",
    "the two arrays have the same length , and the directions are specified by normalized vectors @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) and @xmath37 . in this case , the current is @xmath38 . if the dipoles coherently oscillate with the same phase , then the emitted electric fields are superimposed and form a wave front at a position far from the array in the @xmath34 plane as drawn in fig .  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the electric field vector of the wave front , @xmath39 , satisfies @xmath40 and travels with wavenumber vector @xmath41 .",
    "thus , if we place the dipole arrays far enough from the object , the induced em waves become slowly decaying incident plane waves in the @xmath34 plane to a good approximation .",
    "the arrays of dipoles have to be long enough to form the plane wave .    for the transmission configuration",
    ", we calculate @xmath42 ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) . figure  [ fig3 ] shows a typical transmission configuration , which includes an arbitrary periodic object asymmetric along the @xmath19 axis .",
    "the relation between the current @xmath12 , the direction @xmath35 of the dipole , and the wavenumber vector @xmath41 of the wave front is summarized as @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "it is convenient to expand the electric field into a fourier series for the calculation of periodic sources : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the fourier coefficient of @xmath49 , @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , and @xmath52 is the periodicity of the object along the @xmath53 axis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath19 component is expressed in homogeneous media in vacuum as @xmath54 , where the signs correspond to the directions along the @xmath19 axis .",
    "when the dipole array is composed of sufficiently small and numerous dipoles , the integration can be calculated to good accuracy as    @xmath55    where @xmath56 . to ensure that the integration is proportional to @xmath57 , the array of dipoles has to be longer than @xmath58 : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the least common multiple of the diffraction channels which are open at the frequency @xmath17 .",
    "this condition would usually be satisfied when @xmath39 forms a plane wave .    by permutating 1 and 2 in eq .",
    "( [ j1e2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath61 . equation  ( [ j1e2 ] ) and the reciprocal theorem in eq .",
    "( [ reci ] ) lead to the equation @xmath62 each electric vector @xmath63 ( @xmath36 ) is observed at the position @xmath10 where there is another current @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the integral in eq .",
    "( [ reci ] ) is reduced to eq .",
    "( [ j1e2 ] ) which is expressed only by the zeroth components of the transmitted electric field .",
    "the reciprocity is thus independent of higher order harmonics , which are responsible for the modulated em fields in structured objects . when there is no periodic object in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , a similar relation holds : @xmath66 the transmittance @xmath67 is given by @xmath68 from eqs .",
    "( [ e_reci])([t_reci ] ) , we finally reach the reciprocal relation @xmath69 .    the feature of the proof that @xmath69 is independent of the detailed evaluation of @xmath63 and therefore makes the proof simple and general .",
    "the proof can be extended to two - dimensional periodic structure by replacing the one - dimensional periodic structure in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] by two - dimensional one .",
    "although we have considered periodic objects , the proof can also be extended to non - periodic objects . to do this extension , eq .",
    "( [ e_expand ] ) has to be expressed in the general form @xmath70 , and a more detailed calculation for @xmath71 is required .",
    "reciprocity for transmission thus holds irrespective of absorption , diffraction , and scattering by objects .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the induced electric fields @xmath14 are polarized in the @xmath34 plane . the polarization is called tm polarization in the terminology of waveguide theory and is also often called @xmath72 polarization . for te polarization ( which is often called @xmath73 polarization ) for which @xmath14 has a polarization parallel to the @xmath74 axis ,",
    "the proof is similar to what we have described except that the dipoles are aligned along the @xmath74 axis .",
    "reciprocal reflection is also shown in a similar way .",
    "the configuration is depicted in fig .",
    "the two sources have to be located to satisfy the mirror symmetry about the @xmath19 axis .",
    "the calculation of @xmath71 leads to the reciprocal relation for reflectance @xmath75 .",
    "note that @xmath76 in eq .",
    "( [ e0_reci ] ) has to be evaluated by replacing the periodic object by a perfect mirror .",
    "an example of reciprocal optical response is shown here . figure [ fig5](a )",
    "displays the structure of the sample and reciprocal transmission configuration .",
    "the sample consists of periodic grooves etched in metallic films of au and cr on a quartz substrate .",
    "the periodicity is 1200 nm , as indicated by the dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) .",
    "the unit cell has the structure of au : air : au : air = 3:1:4:5 .",
    "the thickness of au , cr , and quartz is 40 nm , 5 nm , and 1 mm , respectively .",
    "the structure is obviously asymmetric about the @xmath19 axis .",
    "the profile was modeled from an afm image of the fabricated sample .",
    "figure  [ fig5](b ) shows our numerical results .",
    "the incident light has @xmath77 and tm polarization ( the electric vector is in the @xmath34 plane ) .",
    "the numerical calculation was done with an improved s - matrix method@xcite the permittivities of gold and chromium were taken from refs .   and ; the permittivity of quartz is well known to be 2.13 . in the numerical calculation",
    ", the incident light is taken to be a plane wave , and harmonics up to @xmath78 in eq .",
    "( [ e_expand ] ) were used , which is enough to obtain accurate optical responses .",
    "the result indicates that transmission spectra ( lower solid line ) are numerically the same in the reciprocal configurations , while reflection ( upper solid line ) and absorption ( dotted line ) spectra show a definite difference .",
    "the absorption is plotted along the left axis .",
    "the difference implies that surface excitations are different on each side and absorb different numbers of photons . nonetheless , the transmission spectra are the same for incident wavenumber vectors @xmath79 and @xmath80 .    experimental transmission spectra",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](c ) and are consistent within experimental error .",
    "reciprocity is thus confirmed both numerically and experimentally .",
    "there have a few experiments on reciprocal transmission ( see references in ref .  ) . in comparison with these results , fig .",
    "[ fig5](c ) shows the excellent agreement of reciprocal transmission and is the best available experimental evidence supporting reciprocity .",
    "we note that transmission spectra in figs .",
    "[ fig5](b ) and [ fig5](c ) agree quantitatively above 700 nm .",
    "on the other hand , they show a qualitative discrepancy below 700 nm .",
    "the result could come from the difference between the modeled profile in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) and the actual profile of the sample .",
    "the dip at 660 nm stems from a surface plasmon at the metal - air interface , so that the measured transmission spectra would be affected significantly by the surface roughness and the deviation from the modeled structure .",
    "as described in sec .  [ thm ] , the reciprocal theorem assumes that all media are linear and show local response .",
    "logically , it can happen that the reciprocal optical responses do not hold for nonlinear or nonlocally responding media .",
    "reference   discusses an explicit difference of the transmittance for a reciprocal configuration in a nonlinear optical crystal of knbo@xmath81:mn .",
    "the values of the transmittance deviate by a few tens of percent in the reciprocal configuration .",
    "the crystal has a second - order response such that @xmath82 .",
    "the break down of reciprocity comes from the nonlinearity .",
    "does reciprocity also break down in nonlocal media ?",
    "in nonlocal media the induction * d * is given by @xmath83 .",
    "although a general proof for this case has not been reported to our knowledge , it has been shown that reciprocity holds in a particular stratified structure composed of nonlocal media.@xcite    in summary , we have presented an elementary and heuristic proof of the reciprocal optical responses for transmittance and reflectance . when the reciprocal theorem in eq .",
    "( [ reci ] ) holds , the reciprocal relations come from geometrical configurations of light sources and observation points , and are independent of the details of the objects .",
