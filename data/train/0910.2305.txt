    "the effective temperatures of ms and sg stars were also derived adopting 1d atlas  9 model atmospheres ( see ( * ? ? ? * kurucz 2005 ) ) and using the same fitting procedure .",

    "although the colour @xmath9 is sensitive to surface gravity , a priori , this result was not expected , and suggest that subgiants in this cluster have actually higher li abundances than dwarfs .",
    "the li abundances were derived using 3d model atmospheres .",
    "the line formation of li was treated in non - local thermodynamical equilibrium ( nlte ) using the same code and model atom used in @xcite .",

    "the models assuming pure atomic diffusion , and , among those including turbulent mixing , t6.0 and t6.09 , are ruled out by our observations .",
    "all such models predict that in dwarf stars li should be either more abundant or the same as in subgiant stars . the only model which predicts a li pattern which is qualitatively similar to that observed , is the t6.25 model .",
    "models including atomic diffusion and tachocline mixing ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* piau 2008 ) ) do not seem to reproduce our observations , since they provide a constant li abundance up to 5500k .",

    "* talon & charbonnel 2004 ) ) , seem to predict accurately the li abundance pattern in solar - type stars , at solar metallicity ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* charbonnel & talon 2005 ) ) , but models at low metallicity are still needed .",
