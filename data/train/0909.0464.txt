    "we take advantage here of two surveys of the same field : ( i ) the xmm - large scale structure survey ( xmm - lss ; pierre et al . 2004 ) to survey the x - ray sky to a relatively low flux limit of 1@xmath610@xmath7 erg s@xmath9 @xmath8 in the 0.5@xmath32 kev band and ( ii ) the wide part of canada france hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls ; cuillandre & bertin 2006 ) to observe limited portions of the sky to faint magnitude limits in five optical bands .",
    "the vast majority of the agns known today were discovered during optical surveys like the bright palomar quasar survey ( pg ; schmidt & green 1983 ) , the large bright quasar survey ( lbqs ; hewett et al .",
    "1995 ) , the hamburg - eso quasar survey ( he s ; reimers , koehler & wisotzki 1996 ) the two degree field quasar survey ( 2df ; croom et al . 2001 ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; schneider et al .",
    "such optical colour selection based on wide photometric bands can miss the obscured agns .",
    "the sdss survey has identified many type 2 agns based on the presence of narrow emission lines in their spectra without broad lines , and with emission line ratios typical of agn ( kauffmann et al .",
    "2003 ; zakamska et al . 2003 ) . alternatively",
    ", x - ray surveys include agns without narrow emission lines or those at high redshift where emission line selection is not possible .",
    "this is why the identification of x - ray sources down to low optical magnitudes is an important step towards elucidating agn activity .",
    "there are a number of existing surveys in various energy bands in the x - ray wavelength range such as the emss ( einstein extended medium sensitivity survey ; maccacaro et al .",

    "have @xmath59 @xmath15 40% and hence could be bl lac candidates . to further investigate the possibility for these 17 sources to be bl lac candidates we looked for any sign of radio emission from these objects ( this is another indication of the presence of non - thermal emission ) both in the literature and the nvss .",
    "three among the 17 sources with @xmath59 @xmath15 40% are found to be radio emitters .",
    "it is thus likely that these 3 objects ( xlss j022509.7@xmath3050950 , xlss j022609.9@xmath3045805 , xlss j022659.2@xmath3043529 ) are bl lacs .",
    "it is also probable that emission lines in algs are weak and could be revealed by deeper observations",
    ". it would be interesting to conduct follow - up observations of our sample of 32 absorption - line galaxies to study this population in more detail .",
    "we have presented the optical spectroscopic classification of 489 x - ray sources .",
    "they were drawn from an initial sample of 829 x - ray sources detected in the course of the xmm - lss survey that overlap one of the wide fields of the cfhtls .",
    "the sources have a detection threshold of 15 in either the 0.5@xmath32 kev or 2@xmath310 kev bands and are brighter than 22 mag in the optical @xmath1-band .",
    "this sample of 829 x - ray sources is thus flux limited in both x - ray and optical bands .",
    "we observed 695 of these objects with the aaomega system at the aat of which spectroscopic identification was possible for 489 sources ( our sample is therefore @xmath070% complete ) .",
    "a large fraction of these x - ray sources were identified as blagns ( @xmath055% ) based on the fwhm of the emission lines present in their spectra .",
    "in addition to these blagns , 74 sources are identified as galactic stars , 32 are absorption - line galaxies , and 116 are emission - line galaxies .",
    "based on bpt diagram we find that the emission lines in 55 ( 61 ) of the 116 emission line galaxies are powered significantly by an agn ( starburst ) .",
    "for the broad - line agns , @xmath11 is found to correlate well with the rest frame monochromatic luminosity at 2500     ( see also krumpe et al .",
    "2007 , just et al .",
    "2007 , gibson , brandt & schneider 2008 , green et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the rest frame x - ray and uv monochromatic luminosities at 2 kev and 2500     respectively are found to be closely correlated for broad line agns .",
    "no dependence of @xmath11 with redshift is found .",
    "this is similar to the results by just et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and green et al .",
    "( 2009 ) but in contrast to yuan et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and bechtold et al .",
    "( 2003 ) studies who found a correlation of @xmath11 with redshift .",
    "we detect 32 x - ray emitting galaxies with no sign of agn activity in their optical spectra .",
    "they are found to be located in a well defined part of the ir - color - color diagram .",
    "it would be very interesting to perform more focussed observations to investigate the true nature of what seems to be a particular population of x - ray sources .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for his / her critical comments that led to significant improvement of the paper .",
    "we also thank the present and former staff of the anglo - australian observatory for their work in building and operationg the aaomega facility .",
