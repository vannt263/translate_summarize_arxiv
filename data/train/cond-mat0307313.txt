    "polar surfaces have attracted wide attention not only for fundamental science but also for technological applications , because several interesting properties , such as novel catalytic activity , two dimensional electron system , are expected for the polar surface .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the atomic geometry of non - polar ( 100 ) and polar ( 111 ) faces of rocksalt crystals schematically .",
    "the ( 111 ) surface consists of only one atomic species , either cations or anions , while the ( 100 ) surface consists of the same number of cations and anions . in a rocksalt structure crystal ,",
    "each atom is surrounded by six atoms of different species .",
    "the coordination number decreases to five for atoms on a ( 100 ) surface , while it changes drastically to three for atoms on a ( 111 ) surface .",
    "therefore , surface energy of the ( 111 ) face is much higher than that of the ( 100 ) face , which makes the ( 111 ) surface unstable@xcite . in other words ,",
    "alternate stacking of cation and anion layers forms a dipole layer along the [ 111 ] direction ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]-a ) .",
    "accumulation of the dipole layers would produce a macroscopic electric field , which causes appearance of a flat ( 111 ) surface to be quite unpreferable in the rocksalt structure compounds and the flat ( 111 ) surface does not occur in nature .    from a theoretical viewpoint , the macroscopic electric field in the polar surface",
    "can be cancelled either by surface reconstruction or by reduction of effective charge of the surface layer .",
    "according to wolf , the polar ( 111 ) surface of rocksalt crystals would be stable under an octapole termination , which leads to formation of a 2@xmath02 reconstruction on the ( 111 ) surface@xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]-b ) . on the other hand , tsukada and hoshino pointed out that the change in charge state of surface atoms could stabilize the ( 111 ) surface of rocksalt structure compounds@xcite .",
    "if the charge of top atoms is reduced to half of the bulk atoms , the macroscopic electric field would not appear .    under these backgrounds ,",
    "several attempts to grow the polar surface of rocksalt structure compounds have been performed so far@xcite .",
    "metal oxides have been extensively studied to create crystals or thin films having ( 111 ) surfaces . for a nio(111 ) surface , p(2@xmath02 )",
    "reconstruction was found , and the surface was determined to be a single ni termination with double steps by the measurement of grazing - incidence x - ray diffraction@xcite .",
    "the unrecostrcuted surface is stabilized by some adsorbates .",
    "langell and berrie reported that the nio(111 ) surface is stabilized by oh adsorbates and that desorption of the hydroxyl changes the surface to a thermodynamically more stable nio(100)@xcite .",
    "stabilization by impurities was found also for pb and si on nio(111)@xcite .",
    "in contrast with the surface of single crystals , the electrostatic energy does not reach exorbitant values for the small thickness of a film ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]-c ) .",
    "when the thin film is grown on a metal substrate , further reduction of energy could come from the image charge induced in the supporting metal surface .",
    "_ have studied the growth of nio on au(111 ) by leed and stm , and obtained a 6 ml thick stable p(2@xmath02 ) reconstructed nio(111 ) film@xcite . for a feo(111 ) thin film , interesting results were reported by koike and furukawa@xcite .",
    "they obtained the feo ( 111 ) p(2@xmath02 ) surface by oxidizing fe(110 ) and measured the polarization of secondary electrons emitted from the feo ( 111 ) surface .",
    "ferromagnetic ordering was found for the feo ( 111 ) p(2@xmath02 ) surface , although feo itself was an antiferromagnetic material with the neel temperature of 198 k. they thought that the ferromagnetic ordering comes from the reconstruction of a polar feo ( 111 ) surface to reduce the large electrostatic surface energy . on the other hand ,",
    "the relaxation , that is , the decrease in interlayer spacing , was observed for the feo ( 111 ) grown on pt ( 111)@xcite . in this case , the layer by layer growth was limited to a maximum of 2.5 ml .",
    "thus , although the ( 111 ) surface of rocksalt structure oxides has been studied by many groups , there have been few studies on unreconstructed adsorbate - free ( 111 ) surfaces of a rocksalt structure until now .",
    "furthermore , the electronic structure of the polar surface has not been clear . in the preset study , we have examined growth of a mgo thin film on ag(111 ) by supplying mg and o , alternately .",
    "mgo has a rocksalt structure with a lattice constant of 4.21  , while ag has a fcc structure with a lattice constant of 4.09  . as the lattice misfit of mgo to ag is only -2.9 % , the first mg layer is expected to become a template for the growth of the mgo film along the [ 111 ] direction .",
    "the commensurate bonding between mg and ag atoms at the interface might help alternate stacking of mg and o layers , leading to a flat ( 111 ) surface .",
    "actually , we have observed rather streak rheed pattern , implying formation of a flat ( 111 ) mgo surface .",
    "we have characterized the grown surface by using eels and ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy ( ups ) and discussed stabilization mechanism of the polar surface .",
    "the experiments were performed in a custom - designed ultrahigh - vacuum ( uhv ) system with a base pressure of 2@xmath010@xmath2 pa . a mechanically and electrochemically polished ag(111 )",
    "surface was cleaned by repeated cycles of ar@xmath3 sputtering and annealing at 900 k. after repeated preparation cycles , a sharp rheed pattern was observed , and no contamination was detected by aes .",
    "a mgo film was grown by alternate adsorption of mg and o@xmath1 on ag(111 ) at substrate temperature of 300 k. first , 1 ml ( 2  ) mg was deposited by evaporating high purity ( 99.98 % ) mg onto ag(111 ) .",
    "the growth rate was monitored using a quartz crystal oscillator .",
    "the mg film was dosed with 10 l o@xmath1 .",
    "real - time observation of the crystallinity and orientation of films was done by rheed .",
    "surface compositions and the electronic structure of the grown films were investigated _ in situ _ by aes , eels , and ups . the analyses were performed with a double pass cma ( phi 15 - 255 g ) in the analysis chamber .",
    "adoption of a pulse counting detector reduced the probing electron current down to 1 na , which reduced surface damage as much as possible .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the auger spectrum of the 10 ml thick mgo film grown on ag(111 ) .",
    "disappearance of the ag lmm auger peak ( 351 ev ) indicated that the grown mgo film covered the ag(111 ) substrate completely because the inelastic mean free path of 351 ev electron was around 1 nm . the chemical state of mg atoms of the mgo film was known by the energy of the mg lmm auger peak , because the energy of the mg lmm auger peak is 45 ev and 32 ev for metallic mg and mgo , respectively@xcite .",
    "the energy of the mg lmm auger peak was 32 ev for the grown mgo film , showing that mg was completely oxidized .",
    "the stoichiometry of the mgo film was also examined by the ratio of the mg kll auger peak intensity to the o kll auger peak intensity .",
    "considering the auger electron emission probabilities@xcite , the ratio of the amount of mg to that of o was 1 : 0.92@xmath40.18@xcite , supporting the idea that a stoichiometric mgo film was grown on ag(111 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the typical sequence of rheed pattern during the growth at a substrate temperature of 300 k. the incident electron beam was parallel to the [ 1@xmath50 ] azimuth of the substrate .",
    "the result of rheed patterns indicated that the mgo film grew heteroepitaxially on ag(111 ) .",
    "the epitaxial orientation of the mgo film was determined to be ( 111)@xmath6//(111)@xmath7 and [ 1@xmath50]@xmath6//[1@xmath50]@xmath7 .",
    "the half - order streaks did not appear during the growth , showing that the ( 1@xmath01 ) unreconstructed mgo(111 ) film was grown on ag(111 ) .",
    "streaks in rheed patterns indicated that a rather flat ( 111 ) surface could be obtained .",
    "the rheed pattern became blurred with increasing film thickness , suggesting that a thick mgo(111 ) film was unstable .",
    "the in - plane lattice constant of the mgo(111 ) film was calculated from the spacing between streaks in the rheed pattern .",
    "for the 10 ml thick mgo(111)/ag(111 ) , the in - plane lattice constant was determined to be 3.28@xmath40.03 @xcite , which was + 10 % larger than that of bulk one ( 2.97  ) .",
    "the in - plane lattice constant was 3.25@xmath40.03  for the 2 ml thick film and did not change with film thickness , indicating that the expansion was uniform throughout the epitaxial layer .",
    "the increase of the in - plane lattice constant leads to reduction of the surface electron density , which might help a decrease in the electrostatic energy of the mgo(111 ) film .      having established the existence of the ( 1@xmath01 ) unreconstructed mgo(111 ) film on ag(111 ) , we should discuss why this structure is stable in spite of the previously mentioned arguments on the instability of a polar surface of ionic crystals@xcite .",
    "we think that the stabilization of the ( 1@xmath01 ) unreconstructed mgo(111 ) film can be explained in terms of interaction between ag and mg atoms at the interface and charge state of surface atoms .    in the previous study , a single crystalline mgo(100 )",
    "film grew heteroepitaxially on ag(100 ) by evaporating mgo congruently from an electron beam evaporator(eb)@xcite . on ag(111 ) , however , a mgo film could not grow heteroepitaxially by eb .",
    "heteroepitaxial growth of a single crystalline mgo film was achieved by alternate adsorption of mg and o@xmath1 on ag(111 ) .",
    "these facts indicate that the strong interaction between mg and ag atoms plays a decisive role in stabilizing the ( 1@xmath01 ) mgo(111 ) film .",
    "the free energy of the interface ( @xmath8 ) is smaller for the case with coherent mg - ag bonds as compared with the case , in which fine particles with thermodynamically more stable \\{100 } faces grow on ag(111 ) without coherent mg - ag bonds .",
    "the structure of the grown film is determined to minimize the sum of the electrostatic energy of the film ( @xmath9 ) and @xmath8 . here",
    ", we should notice that @xmath9 of a ( 111 ) film does not reach exorbitant values for ultrathin films ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2]-c ) , because @xmath9 is proportional to the film thickness .",
    "therefore , the gain in interaction between mg and ag overcomes the disadvantage of the electrostatic energy , and the ( 1@xmath01 ) unreconstructed mgo(111 ) film is grown on ag(111 ) .",
    "in addition to the strong interaction with mg atoms , the ag substrate plays another important role for stabilization of the mgo(111 ) film .",
    "the mgo film was prepared by alternate adsorption of mg and o@xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the film is unstable due to breakdown of charge neutrality ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]-d ) , when the film thickness is odd number ( mg top ) . on the metal substrate , however , the image charge is induced in a metal , helping stabilization of the film with odd layers .",
    "besides the strong interaction between mg and ag atoms at the interface , the stabilization of mgo(111 ) can be explained in terms of charge state . due to the reduction of the coordination number ,",
    "madelung potential largely decreases for the surface o@xmath10 on the ( 111 ) surface .",
    "the binding energy of the 2p band , thus , decreases for the surface o@xmath10 , and the fermi level might be located in the 2p band .",
    "in such a case , electrons flow out of the upper valence states of the surface o@xmath10 , and the charge of the surface o@xmath10 is reduced .",
    "the charge of the mg@xmath11 at the interface would also decrease to keep the film neutral ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]-e ) .",
    "the decrease in the charge reduces a macroscopic electric field , and the instability of the film should be remedied .",
    "that is the second point to stabilize the polar mgo(111 ) film on ag(111 ) .",
    "here we should notice that the reduction in charge of surface o@xmath10 leads to reduction of madelung potential .",
    "therefore , the amount of the charge transfer is determined under the condition , in which both madelung potential and the charge of surface o@xmath10 are self consistent .",
    "tsukada and hoshino studied the o - terminated mgo(111 ) surface by dv - x@xmath12 calculations , and revealed that the charge of the top and bottom atoms is reduced to half of the bulk atoms@xcite .",
    "when the charge of the surface atom is reduced to half of the bulk atoms , the macroscopic electric field would not appear , irrespective of the film thickness . in the present study , a thick mgo(111 )",
    "film could not be grown on ag(111 ) , implying that the charge of the topmost o atoms did not reduce to half of the bulk one .",
    "finally , we would discuss the surface reconstruction of the mgo(111 ) film .",
    "since the surface energy of a \\{100 } face is lower than that of a \\{111 } face in rocksalt structure compounds , \\{100 } faces are expected to appear for growth normal to the ( 111 ) face . in case of nacl / gaas(111)a , triangular pyramids with three exposed \\{100 }",
    "faces grow on the substrate@xcite . as discussed in introduction , a p(2@xmath02 ) reconstructed nio(111 ) film is grown on au(111)@xcite , and the p(2@xmath02 ) structure corresponds to the smallest triangular pyramids surrounded by \\{100 } faces . here , we should notice that both films were grown by congruent evaporation of nio or nacl at the substrate temperatures higher than 420 k. therefore , the grown film forms in a thermodynamically stable structure . in the present case ,",
    "however , we have grown a metastable flat mgo(111 ) film by alternate adsorption of mg and o@xmath1 at 300 k.",
    "once a flat ( 111 ) film is formed on ag(111 ) , activation energy is needed to change the metastable ( 111 ) film into stable triangular pyramids surrounded by \\{100 } faces .",
    "therefore , the flat unreconstructed ( 111 ) mgo film remains in a metastable form on ag(111 ) .",
    "as we could prepare the unreconstructed polar mgo(111 ) surface , the electronic structure of this surface was investigated by eels and ups , comparing with that of a non - polar mgo(100 ) surface@xcite .",
    "absence of ag lmm auger peak in the 10 ml mgo(111)/ag(111 ) assures that eels and ups probe the mgo film with influences of the substrate negligible , because their probing depth is smaller than or equal to that of aes .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows ups spectrum for the mgo(111 ) surface measured with a he i ( 21.2 ev ) source . for comparison , the spectrum of the 10 ml thick mgo(100 ) film on ag(100 ) is included in the same figure .",
    "the main features for mgo(111 ) were almost similar to those for mgo(100 ) except around the fermi level .",
    "for mgo(100 ) , there were no density of states ( dos ) near the fermi level , while an appreciable dos appeared in the region from 2 ev to the fermi level for mgo(111 ) .",
    "these finite dos at the fermi level did not originate from metallic mg , since component of metallic mg was not observed in aes .",
    "furthermore , we have revealed that the finite dos at the fermi level disappeared even for the incompletely oxidized film in the previous study@xcite .",
    "therefore , the finite dos at fermi level did not originate from metallic mg or the incompletely oxidized mg , the surface states of mgo(111 ) .",
    "the ups results suggested that the polar mgo(111 ) surface was a metallic surface .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows the eels of the mgo(111 ) surface measured with primary electron energy of 60 ev . for comparison , spectrum of the mgo(100 )",
    "surface is also shown in the figure .",
    "the structure above 7 ev for mgo(111 ) was almost similar to that of mgo(100 ) , showing that a stoichiometric mgo film grew on ag(111)@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , difference appears in the structure below 5 ev between mgo(100 ) and ( 111 ) .",
    "in contrast with mgo(100 ) , the clear band gap region was not observed for mgo(111 ) .",
    "in addition , the tail of the elastic peak became larger and a new peak ( p1 ) appeared at 1.2 ev , indicating existence of the inelastically scattered electrons with small loss - energy@xcite .",
    "since the aes signal indicative of mg metal was not observed at all , the tail or the new peak did not originate from mg aggregates in the mgo film .    due to the low growth temperature and the significant mismatch between the substrate and the oxide lattice",
    ", the film may contain a significant concentration of defects .",
    "therefore , the spectroscopic features could be due to emission from defect states in the mgo(111 ) film .",
    "defective mgo surfaces have been studied by a variety of techniques such as ups , eels , theoretical calculation , etc . in eels of defective mgo surfaces , sharp peaks",
    "are observed at 2.3 ev and 5 ev , which are attributed to mg vacancy ( v center ) and o vacancy ( f center ) , respectively .",
    "sharp structures are also observed for mgo powders by diffuse reflectance spectra , and these structures at 5.8 and 4.6 ev have been attributed to ions with four and three - fold ligand coordination@xcite . on the other hand , such sharp peaks were not observed in the eels of mgo(111 ) below 5 ev .",
    "recently , we have revealed that metal induced gas states(migs ) were formed at the insulator - metal interface@xcite . since the new states of the mgo(111 ) film were observed independently of the film thickness , the states did not originate from migs . therefore , the structure below 5 ev could be assigned to the excitation of electrons in the unfilled band derived from o 2p , or the excitations of newly appearing electronic states on the ( 111 ) surface .",
    "the ups and eels results suggested that the mgo(111 ) surface was not an insulating surface but a semiconducting or metallic surface .",
    "this electronic structure of the mgo(111 ) surface can be explained in terms of madelung potential as discussed in the previous section .",
    "compared to the binding energy of isolated ions , the binding energy of mg@xmath11 3s orbital decreases , and the binding energy of o@xmath10 2p orbital increases by the madelung potential in a crystal phase . because of the decrease in the coordination number , the madelung potential largely decreases for the ( 111 ) surface , compared with the ( 100 ) surface .",
    "therefore , the band gap is reduced and the mgo(111 ) surface changes into a semiconductor or metallic surface .",
    "however , a possibility of certain new electronic state characteristic of the ( 111 ) surface can not be excluded .",
    "heteroepitaxial growth of mgo on ag(111 ) has been investigated by rheed , aes , ups and eels .",
    "the flat unreconstructed polar mgo(111 ) surface was obtained on ag(111 ) by alternate adsorption of mg and o@xmath1 at substrate temperature of 300 k. the eels and ups of the ( 111 ) surface were different from those of the ( 100 ) surface . for mgo(111 ) , a clear band gap region was not observed in eels , while finite density of states appeared in ups , implying that the mgo(111 ) surface was a semiconducting or metallic surface .",
