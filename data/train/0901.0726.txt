    "recently , the star collaboration @xcite observed a @xmath1-@xmath2 correlation of particles associated with a high-@xmath3 near - side hadron trigger particle in central au+au collisions at @xmath0 gev , where @xmath4 and @xmath2 are the azimuthal angle and pseudorapidity differences measured relative to the trigger particle , respectively .",
    "particles associated with the near - side jet can be decomposed into a `` jet component '' at @xmath5@xmath6(0,0 ) , and a `` ridge component '' at @xmath7@xmath80 with a ridge structure in @xmath2 .",
    "a similar correlation with a high-@xmath3 trigger has also been observed by the phenix collaboration @xcite and the phobos collaboration @xcite .",
    "recent reviews of the ridge phenomenon have also been presented @xcite .    in this manuscript",
    ", we shall limit our attention to the ridge phenomenon involving a high @xmath3 jet on the near - side .",
    "we shall not consider ridge - type @xmath1-@xmath2 correlations that have also been observed between two low-@xmath3 hadrons @xcite , as they do not involve the occurrence of a high-@xmath3 jet on the near - side .",
    "many theoretical models @xcite have been proposed to discuss the ridge phenomenon .",
    "the model of ref .",
    "@xcite assumes that the ridge particles arise from the extra particles deposited by the forward and backward beam jets at the source point associated with the two transverse jets .",
    "the correlation of the jet source transverse position and the transverse medium flow then leads to an azimuthal distribution with a width in @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the width in @xmath1 obtained from such a model is wide in comparison with experimental data @xcite .",
    "the correlated emission model @xcite assumes that ridge particles arise from soft thermal gluons radiated along the jet direction , with an enhancement due to the radial flow .",
    "the models of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite deal with the azimuthal correlations in the central rapidity region , and the pseudorapidity correlation has not yet been considered .",
    "the back - splash model assumes that the ridge on the near - side arises from the hydrodynamical back - splash of the away - side jet flow @xcite ; hydrodynamical calculations for such a model has not yet been made .",
    "the glasma model examines @xmath1-@xmath2 correlation between two low-@xmath3 hadrons @xcite without a high-@xmath3 trigger and assumes that the ridge in soft low-@xmath3 pairs arises from the initially boost - invariant distribution that persists in the bulk matter for low-@xmath3 particles @xcite .",
    "the jet broadening models @xcite consider the ridge particles as arising from radiated gluons of the incident jet ; they have not been compared quantitatively with the ridge data . taking the features of jet broadening as free parameters in a hydrodynamical calculation leads to a theoretical jet peak to ridge ratio large in comparison with experiment @xcite .",
    "the possibility of the intermediate @xmath3 trigger arising from the medium - medium recombination adds further complications to the analysis of the ridge phenomenon @xcite .",
    "recent phobos observation that the ridge extends to pseudorapidity separations as large as @xmath94 @xcite provides an important test for the models .",
    "successful analyses of experimental near - side data have been obtained in the momentum kick model , over large phase space of the associated particles in @xmath3 , @xmath10 and @xmath2 @xcite . in this model , the ridge particles",
    "are described as arising from partons in the medium that are kicked by the jet .",
    "we envisage that a near - side jet emerges near the surface , kicks ( or scatters ) medium partons , loses energy , and fragments into the trigger particle and fragmentation products . by assumption of parton - hadron duality ,",
    "the kicked ( or scattered ) medium partons subsequently materialize as the observed ridge particles , which can be used to extract valuable information on the jet - medium interaction and the properties of the early parton medium . in the description of the interaction between the medium and a jet in the momentum kick model , we have chosen to represent the medium as particles instead of fields , because of ( i ) the short - range nature of the color screening interaction between partons in a dense color medium @xcite and ( ii ) the observed azimuthal kinematic correlation between the ridge particles and the trigger jet .",
    "our task can be made easier here as we can divide the theoretical analysis in three steps .",
    "the first step is to set up the basic phenomenological theory of the momentum kick model in which physical quantities enter as important parameters .",
    "the second step consists of comparing the extracted physical quantities with those in other observed phenomena .",
    "the third step consists of constructing fundamental theoretical models that can explain these physical quantities .",
    "following such a strategy , we describe the production process of associated particles as consisting of the jet component and the ridge component .",
    "the ridge component depends on the magnitude of the momentum kick , the number of jet-(medium parton ) collisions , and the shape of the early medium parton momentum distribution . on the other hand , the jet component yield per trigger in a nucleus - nucleus collision",
    "can be described as an attenuated jet component of a @xmath11 collision .",
    "it is therefore necessary to analyze the auxiliary associated particle yield in @xmath11 collisions in order to specify the jet component in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "our successful description of the experimental data allows us to extract physical quantities from star near - side ridge data in central au+au collisions at @xmath0 gev @xcite . in the process",
    ", we infer that the shape of the early parton momentum distribution possesses a thermal - like transverse distribution and a rapidity plateau structure .",
    "we find that the magnitude of the longitudinal momentum kick is about 1 gev per jet-(medium parton ) collision .",
    "we infer also that for a central au+au collision the number of jet-(medium parton ) collision multiplied by the attenuation factor is about 4 . as",
    "not much is known about these physical quantities , the extracted quantities provide useful insight into the properties of the early partons and their interactions with the jet in nucleus - nucleus collisions .    with the successes in analyzing the star near - side ridge data ,",
    "it is of interest to see whether the momentum kick model is consistent with other experimental measurements .",
    "our first test of the momentum kick model gives a good prediction @xcite of the phobos data @xcite at large rapidities , indicating the approximate validity of the momentum kick model and the presence of the rapidity plateau .",
    "we wish to analyze here the phenix ridge data which cover a smaller region of pseudorapidities , @xmath120.35 , but a large number of @xmath13 combinations .",
    "both the jet and ridge components contribute and interplay in the small @xmath2 region on the near - side of the jet .",
    "this is different from the star and phobos ridge data which cover a large range of pseudorapidities .",
    "the jet component is important at @xmath14 whereas the ridge component dominates for @xmath15 .    after extracting the physical quantities from the analysis of the phenix ridge data",
    ", we wish to find out the nature of the scattering between the jet parton and the medium parton . in the experimental set up ,",
    "jet triggers have been accepted in the interval @xmath16 gev .",
    "the incident jet parton has an initial transverse momentum of order @xmath1710 gev , as a jet parton loses a few gev in kicking a few medium partons .",
    "is the scattering between a jet parton and a medium parton a perturbative or non - perturbative qcd scattering process , for jet partons in this momentum range ?",
    "our ability to ascertain the nature of the parton - parton scattering will help us select the proper description to formulate the process of energy loss for these jet partons .",
    "previously , phenomenological model of hadron - hadron differential cross section in terms of parton - parton collisions with a finite correlation length was successfully applied in the modified chou - yang model @xcite . in recent years",
    ", much progress has been made on the description of non - perturbative parton - parton scattering , in connection with a better understanding on the nature of the non - perturbative soft pomeron @xcite .",
    "in particular , hadron - hadron elastic differential cross section analysis and lattice gauge calculations support the concept of the structure of a pomeron with a small correlation length .",
    "these recent theoretical advances will allow us to compare the characteristics of the parton - parton scattering in the present momentum kick model with those parton - parton collisions arising from the exchange of non - perturbative pomerons .",
    "turning to the properties of the early parton momentum distribution extracted from the momentum kick model , we note that the presence of the rapidity plateau in the early history of a central nucleus - nucleus collision as inferred from the momentum kick model is not a surprising result , as the rapidity plateau structure occurs in elementary processes involving the fragmentation of flux tubes @xcite and in many particle production models such as models based on preconfinement @xcite , parton - hadron duality @xcite cluster fragmentation @xcite , string - fragmentation @xcite , dual - partons @xcite , the venus model @xcite , the rqmd model @xcite , multiple collision model @xcite , parton cascade model @xcite , color - glass condensate model @xcite , the ampt model @xcite , the lexus model @xcite , and many others . to investigate the origin of the rapidity plateau in a quantum mechanical framework",
    ", we can go a step further to use the physical argument of transverse confinement to establish a connection between qcd and qed2 ( quantum electrodynamics in 2-dimensions ) @xcite .",
    "one finds that a rapidity plateau of produced particles is a natural occurrence when color charges pull away from each other at high energies @xcite as in qed2 @xcite .",
    "experimental evidence for a rapidity plateau along the sphericity axis or the thrust axis has been observed earlier in @xmath18 production in high - energy @xmath19-@xmath20 annihilations @xcite .",
    "a rapidity plateau structure has also been observed in @xmath11 collisions at rhic energies by the brahms collaboration @xcite .",
    "in addition to the magnitude of the momentum kick acquired by a medium parton per jet-(medium parton ) collision , the ridge data also give information on the number of kicked partons .",
    "these physical quantities are clearly related to the energy loss of a jet in the dense medium .",
    "a consistent picture of both the ridge yield and jet quenching emerges from the momentum kick model analyses @xcite and complements other studies of the jet quenching phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the phenix near - side ridge data also provides an opportunity to examine an additional test of the momentum kick model using a high-@xmath3 photon jet .",
    "nucleon - nucleon collisions can lead to the occurrence of a high-@xmath3 parton jet in coincidence with a high-@xmath3 photon jet . in a central nucleus - nucleus collision with an away - side parton jet",
    ", we can use a photon jet on the near - side to test different ridge models @xcite . by comparing associated particles on the near - side with a hadron or a photon jet , we can separate out effects owing to the collision of the near - side jet .",
    "if the ridge arises from the medium as a result of the collision of the near - side parton jet , as in the momentum kick model , the substitution of a near - side photon jet will lead to a greatly - reduced yield of ridge particles . if the ridge particles arise from `` several extra particles deposited by forward - backward beam jets into the fireball '' , as in the position - flow model of ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite then the near - side ridge will remain for a near - side photon jet .",
    "if the ridge arises from the back splash of the propagation of away - side parton jet , then the large ridge structure will remain for a near - side photon jet .",
    "it is therefore of interest to make theoretical estimates of the ridge yield in association with a near - side , high-@xmath3 photon jet in the momentum kick model so as to assist experiments in such an analysis .",

    "ii , we review and summarize the main results of the momentum kick model . in section iii , we discuss the jet component in au+au and in @xmath11 collisions .",

    "vi , vii , and viii , we examine new insights derived from the physical quantities extracted from the momentum kick model .",
    "specifically , in section vi , we find that the magnitude of the longitudinal momentum kick along the jet direction @xmath22 is consistent with the characterization that the scattering between the jet parton and the medium parton involves the exchange of a non - perturbative pomeron . in section vii , we find that the extracted shape of the rapidity plateau of the early parton distribution is in between those of the pp and au+au collisions , indicating an intermediate stage of parton evolution . in section viii , we find that the number of kicked partons at the most central collision can provide the correct normalization for the momentum kick model to describe the centrality dependence of the ridge yield .",

    "x , we present our discussions and conclusions .",
    "we shall briefly summarize the basic concepts of the momentum kick model . in the phenomenon of the ridge associated with the near - side jet , it is observed that ( i ) the ridge particle yield increases with the number of participants , ( ii ) the ridge yield appears to be nearly independent of the trigger jet properties , ( iii ) the baryon to meson ratios of the ridge particles are more similar to those of the bulk matter than those of the jet , and ( iv ) the slope parameter of the transverse distribution of ridge particles is intermediate between those of the jet and the bulk matter @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these features suggest that the ridge particles are medium partons , at an early stage of the medium evolution during the passage of the jet .",
    "the azimuthal correlation of the ridge particle with the jet and the presence of strong screening suggest that the associated ridge particle and the trigger jet are related by collisions . a momentum kick model was put forth to explain the ridge phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the model assumes that a near - side jet occurs near the surface , collides with medium partons , loses energy along its way , and fragments into the trigger and its associated fragmentation products ( the `` jet component '' ) .",
    "those medium partons that collide with the jet acquire a momentum kick along the jet direction .",
    "they subsequently materialize by parton - hadron duality as ridge particles in the `` ridge component '' .",
    "in other words , the ridge particles are medium partons kicked by the jet and they carry direct information on the early parton momentum distribution and the magnitude of the longitudinal momentum kick .",
    "as described in detail in @xcite , we follow a jet as it collides with medium partons in a dense medium and study the yield of associated particles for a given @xmath21 .",
    "the evaluation of the ridge yield and the investigation of the quenching of the jet will be greatly simplified by using average values of various physical quantities , whose `` average '' attribute will be made implicit .",
    "we label the normalized initial momentum distribution of medium partons at the moment of jet-(medium parton ) collisions by @xmath23 .",
    "the jet imparts a momentum @xmath24 onto a kicked medium parton , which changes its momentum from @xmath25 to @xmath26 , as a result of the jet-(medium parton ) collision . by assumption of parton - hadron duality ,",

    "note that such a cross section is slightly smaller , but is of the same order of magnitude , as @xmath111 of the correlation length extracted from the momentum kick model in eq .",

    "( [ zetapar ] ) and @xmath111 may provide information on the depth of the non - perturbative potential relative to which the parton scatters .",
    "one can consider experiments with two transverse jets in which one of the two jets is a photon jet on the near side while the other jet is a strongly interacting parton on the away side .",
    "the use of a near - side photon jet allows one to probe the origin of the ridge particles as we discussed in section i @xcite . if the ridge arises from the medium as a result of the collision of the near - side jet , as in the momentum kick model , the substitution of a photon jet for a hadron jet will lead to a greatly - reduced yield of the ridge particles . on the other hand ,",
    "if the ridge particles arise from `` several extra particles deposited by forward - backward beam jets into the fireball '' @xcite or from the back splash model @xcite , then the ridge particles yield will not be significantly reduced .",
    "we can make a quantitative estimate of the ridge yield in the momentum kick model for a photon jet that arises from hard - scattering .",
    "the number of ridge particles depends on the jet-(medium parton ) cross section and the attenuation index @xmath93 . for the high-@xmath3 photon jet , the photon jet-(medium parton )",
    "cross section is @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the fine - structure constant .",
    "we can take @xmath114 as the strong - interaction coupling constant . with @xmath115 mb as given by eq .",
    "( [ zetapar ] ) , we can estimate @xmath116 as the average number of collisions is much less than 1 , we can take @xmath117 in eq .",
    "( [ nks ] ) without much error .",
    "one finds that the ridge yield per photon trigger is then @xmath118 we can evaluate @xmath119 by using eq .",
    "( [ nk ] ) and the photon-(medium parton ) cross section of eq .",
    "( [ phox ] ) and obtain the total number of ridge particle yield per photon jet as a function of the participant number shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) , for the acceptance region as in @xcite .",
    "the yield for the photon jet is about 0.002 per photon jet for the most central au+au collision , which is small indeed .",
    "for all practical purposes , a high-@xmath3 photon jet does not lead to significant production of ridge particles in the momentum kick model .",
    "using the momentum kick model , we examine the phenix near - side ridge particle data for central au+au collisions at @xmath0 gev which cover the range of pseudorapidity , @xmath120 , and a large number of @xmath121 combinations .",
    "we find that the phenix data can be described by the momentum kick model .    with the successful analysis of the ridge data from star , phobos , and phenix collaborations , it is of great interest to find out whether the extracted physical quantities are compatible with those in other relevant physical phenomena .",
    "the most important quantity extracted is the ( average ) magnitude of the longitudinal momentum kick @xmath22 along the jet direction imparted on the medium parton by the jet parton in a parton - parton collision .",
    "we find that such a quantity is related to the momentum transfer squared @xmath122 of the incident jet parton .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath123 is less than 1 gev@xmath124 , indicating that the scattering is within the realm of non - perturbative qcd .",
    "the scattering of the jet parton and a medium parton is characterized by a correlation length of @xmath1250.39 fm .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the correlation length @xmath68 in parton - parton scattering has been previously obtained in many previous analyses of hadron - hadron elastic differential cross sections and the model the non - perturbative pomeron .",
    "the modified chou - yang model @xcite , the model of the non - perturbative pomeron in terms of the stochastic vacuum @xcite , and lattice gauge calculations of the gluon condensate correlator in @xcite give a correlation lengths in the range 0.25 - 0.37 fm , compatible with the magnitude of the correlation length extracted in the momentum kick model .",
    "it is reasonable to conclude that the parton - parton scattering between the jet parton and the medium parton arises from the exchange of a non - perturbative pomeron .",
    "it should be emphasized that our ability to ascertain the non - perturbative nature of the parton - parton scattering is important in helping us select the proper description for the dynamics of the interaction of the jet and the medium . for jet partons in the momentum range of @xmath126 gev as considered in measurements involving associated particles , a plausible description needs to include the non - perturbative aspects of the scattering between the jet parton and the medium parton , if one wishes to describe the jet momentum loss and the scattered medium partons properly .",
    "we can examine further the shape of the rapidity plateau in the early parton momentum distribution obtained here .",
    "the presence of a rapidity plateau in early history of a central nucleus - nucleus collision as inferred from the momentum kick model is not a surprising result , as the rapidity plateau structure occurs in elementary process involving the fragmentation of flux tubes @xcite and in many particle production models @xcite .",
    "experimental evidence for a plateau in rapidity distributions has been observed earlier in @xmath18 production in high - energy @xmath19-@xmath20 annihilation @xcite and in @xmath11 collisions at rhic energies @xcite . a comparison of the plateau structure of @xmath11 , central au+au , and early parton distributions in fig .",
    "2 places rapidity distribution extracted here as an intermediate stage of the dynamical evolution process , just as indicated by the intermediate value of the inverse slope of the ridge particles between those of the jet and the inclusive particles .",
    "the number of kicked partons extracted here also provide the proper normalization to explore the centrality dependence of the ridge yield , whereas the attenuation index @xmath110 is compatible with the estimates from fragmentation process of the jet parton .",
    "it is of interest to propose the use of high-@xmath3 photon jets to examine the associated particles . in the momentum kick model ,",
    "the collision of a high-@xmath3 hadron jet with the medium partons lead to the recoil of the medium partons which subsequently materialize as ridge particles .",
    "however , for a high-@xmath3 photon jet the photon-(medium parton ) cross section is greatly reduced , leading to a much smaller number of produced ridge particles .",
    "thus , a photon jet on the near - side will lead to a very small yield of ridge particles .",
    "such a feature may be used to discriminate among different models .    in summary ,",
    "we have analyzed phenix near - side ridge data for central au+au collisions at @xmath0 gev .",
    "we found that the data can be described well by the momentum kick model and the extracted physical quantities provide useful information on the nucleus - nucleus collision process .",
    "specifically , the scattering between the jet parton and the medium parton arises from the exchange of a non - perturbative pomeron for @xmath127 gev .",
    "this however is only the first two step in the theoretical analysis .",
    "the final third step consists of the construction of theoretical models that can explain these physical quantities .",
    "another step is to connect the observed physical quantities to other observables such as the momentum distribution of the bulk matter at subsequent stages of the nucleus - nucleus collision .",
    "the momentum kick model can be further improved with additional inclusion of other effects such as the collective flow , a better description of the elementary jet-(medium parton ) collision processes , and perhaps a better monte carlo tracking of the jet trajectory and kicked partons .",
