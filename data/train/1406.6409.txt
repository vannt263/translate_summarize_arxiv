    "edge states play an essential role in condensed matter physics for both fundamental aspects and electronic transport applications . recently , due to their immunity against disorder or impurities ( absence of backscattering ) , topologically protected edge states have raised interest in quantum spin hall systems  @xcite as well as in topological insulators  @xcite .",
    "edge states were first predicted in graphene ribbons  @xcite and later observed along `` zigzag '' edges  @xcite .",
    "although they are not strictly speaking topologically protected , edge states in graphene possess a topological origin coined by the zak phase and remain robust against weak chiral symmetry perturbations  @xcite .",
    "these peculiar features are due to the multicomponent ( spinorial ) structure of the wavefunction . while for scalar wavefunctions ( like for free particles in a box ) , hard wall boundary conditions impose the vanishing of the wavefunction at the edges , for a two - component wavefunction only one component has to vanish , leaving the possibility of a finite amplitude for the other component . in graphene ,",

    "the main advantages of these analogue systems lie in their high tunability and the control of their lattice properties .",
    "the synthetic honeycomb lattices offer the possibility to investigate phenomena that are hardly reachable in genuine graphene , particularly those appearing at the edges .",

    "the red and green color scales give respectively the spatial extension of zigzag and bearded edge states extracted from equations  ( [ eq_bn_zz ] ) and  ( [ eq_an_bd ] ) . for @xmath11 , the diagram shows that zigzag zero - modes occupy 1/3 of the 1d brillouin zone whereas the proportion is 2/3 for the bearded states  @xcite .",
    "thus , the tb prediction for the ratio between number of bearded and zigzag states is 2 .",
    "the diagram also shows that the zero - modes are more localized along zigzag edges than along bearded edges .",

    "the total intensity in each zone is proportional to the number of corresponding zero - modes @xcite . for @xmath12 ,",
    "the measured ratio is 2.3 , in close agreement with the expected value and the bearded edge states do indeed have a larger extension . for @xmath51 ,",
    "we observe a majority of strongly localized bearded edge states and only a few extended zigzag zero - modes .",
    "for @xmath52 , both edge states are equally present , the zigzag ones being slightly more localized .",
    "finally , for @xmath53 , only zigzag zero - modes exist ( the intensity along the bearded edge is strictly zero ) with a larger extension compared to the previous case .",
    "these observations are in good accordance with the features depicted in the diagram of figure  [ fig_diagbz](c ) and demonstrate that the anisotropy parameter allows for an accurate manipulation of edges states .    in the next section , we propose a topological argument , first presented in  @xcite , to address the existence of zero - modes , not only for bearded and zigzag but also for armchair edges .",
    "a simple geometrical way to describe the existence of edge states is to relate their existence to a topological quantity which is a 1d winding number called the zak phase  @xcite . the spectrum of an infinite ribbon of finite width containing @xmath54 dimers @xmath16 consists in @xmath55 one - dimensional bands @xmath56 .",

    "the circulation of @xmath64 along a surrounding closed path is quantized : the berry phase is defined by @xmath66  @xcite .",
    "our purpose here is to stress that the winding of the @xmath64 phase in reciprocal space carries an additional information related to the existence of edge states .",
    "let us consider a ribbon geometry and define the directions parallel ( @xmath29 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath67 to the ribbon length .",
    "for a ribbon of finite width containing @xmath54 dimers , the perpendicular wavevector of a bulk state @xmath68 is quantized .",

    "this equation has @xmath54 or ( @xmath71 ) roots depending on the winding of the phase under variation of @xmath68 .",
    "when only ( @xmath71 ) solutions exist , the missing solution corresponds to an edge state .",
    "more precisely one has the correspondence @xmath72 where the zak phase @xmath73 is the phase accumulated in the first 1d brillouin zone along the @xmath68 direction : @xmath74     stream and density plots of the phase @xmath75 in reciprocal space , for the three edges ( zigzag , bearded and armchai ) and for various deformations ( see the sketches in figures  [ fig_diagbz ] and  [ fig_diagac ] ) .",

    "<S> edge states are one important ingredient to understand transport properties of graphene nanoribbons . </S>",
    "<S> we study experimentally the existence and the internal structure of edge states under uniaxial strain of the three main edges : zigzag , bearded , and armchair . </S>",
    "<S> the experiments are performed on artificial microwave graphene flakes , where the wavefunctions are obtained by direct imaging . </S>",
    "<S> we show that uniaxial strain can be used to manipulate the edge states : a single parameter controls their existence and their spatial extension into the ribbon . by combining tight - binding approach and topological arguments </S>",
    "<S> , we provide an accurate description of our experimental findings . </S>",
    "<S> a new type of zero - energy state appearing at the intersection of two edges , namely the corner state , is also observed and discussed . </S>"
