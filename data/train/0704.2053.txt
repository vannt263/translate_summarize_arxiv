    "schweitzer et al . ( 2006 ) studied the connection between fir emission and pah / low excitation fine - structure emission lines of the local pg quasars .",
    "their results suggest that star formation is responsible for at least 30% to the average local quasar fir emission and that this contribution tends to increase with fir luminosity .",
    "the z@xmath06 sdss quasars we discussed in this paper belong to the population of the brightest quasars in the optical . about @xmath124 of them",
    "are detected at ( sub)mm wavelength . according to figure 4 ,",
    "most of these detections have fir luminosities stronger than the predictions from local quasar templates , indicating extra emission from warm dust in these sources compared to the typical optical quasar emission .",
    "moreover , the relationship between the fir and b band optical emission is non - linear and significantly scattered , only manifesting itself when a larger luminosity range is considered ( see section 4.1 ) .",
    "beelen ( 2004 ) studied a number of optically bright quasar samples at @xmath125 that had ( sub)mm observations , and first report this weak correlation between fir and b band optical emission , namely @xmath126 ( see also cox et al .",
    "the results are consistent when we include our new observations at z@xmath06 . additionally , most of the ( sub)mm detections at z@xmath06 have fir - to - radio ratios or upper limits within the range occupied by star forming galaxies ( see table 4 and figure 6 ) .",
    "one possible explanation for all of these facts is that star formation is happening on a massive scale in the host galaxies of these fir luminous z@xmath06 quasars and dominating the heating process of the fir emitting warm dust .",
    "the implied star formation rate is @xmath127 .",
    "this idea is supported by the detections of co in the high - redshift quasars that have strong fir emission ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "co line emission was detected in several fir luminous quasars at z@xmath1294 , including the highest redshift quasar j114816.64 + 525150.2 ( eg",

    "2006 ; bertoldi et al . 2003b ; walter et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 ) .",
    "the co detections indicate huge amount of molecular gas in the host galaxies of these fir luminous quasars which are the requisite fuel for star formation .",
    "moreover , riechers et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found that the fir - to - co relation of the high - redshift fir luminous quasars are consistent with that defined by ulirgs , starforming galaxies and submillimeter galaxies .",
    "one may argue that the strong fir emission can be also processed by the agn power since the dust torus geometry of these sources are still unkown .",
    "this possibility can not be rule out given the limited data we have for these sources , but detailed dust models are required to explain the results we list above .",
    "one fact is that the hot dust emission of the sdss z@xmath06 quasars probed by recent spitzer observation are similar to those of the local quasar templates as we mentioned in section 1 ( jiang et al .",
    "2006a ) . four",
    "( sub)mm detections are included in this spitzer observed sample , and no different properties are found in the optical to near infrared seds of these sources .",
    "this may not support the idea of a quite different geometry of the dust torus .",
    "however , we should mention that there are still large uncertainties in the estimations of the fir luminosities for these ( sub)mm detected z@xmath06 quasars .",
    "the fir luminosities for some of the sources can be overestimated given the poor data at ( sub)mm wavelengths .",
    "thus further studies on these ( sub)mm detected z@xmath06 quasars are required , including observations of the submm continuum at higher frequencies and emission lines of co and other molecules , such as hcn , as well as the c and @xmath130 fine structure lines .",
    "another interesting question is how the current radio observations constrain the radio loud fraction ( rlf ) at z@xmath06 .",
    "the rlf of optically selected quasar samples is @xmath131 , as quoted in many papers ( kellermann et al .",
    "1989 ; ivezi@xmath132 et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 ; cirasuolo et al .",
    "2003 , 2006 ) .",
    "jiang et al . ( 2006b ) studied the first data ( becker et al .",
    "1995 ) for sdss quasars with redshifts up to 5 , and suggested that the quasar rlf increases with optical luminosity and decreases with redshift , namely @xmath133 .",
    "this result gives an rlf of @xmath134 at @xmath135 , @xmath136 at @xmath137 , and @xmath138 at @xmath139 , given the rest frame 2500@xmath56 absolute ab magnitude @xmath140  the typical value of the z@xmath06 sdss quasar sample is estimated from the absolute ab magnitude at rest frame @xmath141 ( @xmath142 , fan et al .",
    "for the current sample of 19 z@xmath06 sdss quasars with @xmath142 from -26.2 to -27.9 , we adopt a typical value of @xmath143 and an optical spectral power law index of -0.5 . ] .",
    "there is one marginally radio loud source in this z@xmath06 sample of 17 sources .",
    "this result argues against a high rlf , i.e. @xmath144 , for the current sdss quasar sample at z@xmath06 .",
    "thus it is roughly consistent with the result of jiang et al .",
    "( 2006b ) . however , the sample size is still too small to set a strict constrain , i.e. differentiate an rlf between @xmath145 and @xmath131 .",
    "thus to provide a better test of the redshift evolution of the rlf ; we would need a sample three times larger to usefully constrain the rlf at z@xmath06 .",
    "we should also mention the recent discovery of a radio loud quasar at z@xmath746 , first j1427385",
    "+ 331241(mcgreer et al .",
    "2006 ) , with a first flux density of 1.73mjy .",
    "this source is the most radio luminous quasar known at z@xmath06 , with @xmath146 .",
    "however , it can not be included in our radio loud analysis at z@xmath06 , as the selection criteria of this source are quite different from that of the sdss quasars and its uv / optical emission is just beyond the sdss detection limits ( mcgreer et al .",
    "in this paper , we present new results of millimeter and radio observations of a sample of z@xmath06 quasars .",
    "these quasars are selected from the sdss survey and observed with mambo-2 at 250 ghz and the vla at 1.4 ghz .",
    "we obtained three @xmath63 detections and one @xmath147 detection out of 11 observed sources by mambo-2 and six radio detections out of 13 observed sources by the vla .",
    "we combine our new millimeter and radio results of the sdss z@xmath06 quasars with results from the literature and discuss the fir and radio properties of the optically selected quasars at z@xmath06 .",
    "our conclusions are as follows .",
    "+    * eight out of 18 z@xmath06 optically selected quasars are detected in the ( sub)mm regime .",
    "this indicates a ( sub)mm detection rate of @xmath148 at z@xmath06 at mjy sensitivity . within the errors ,",
    "this is consistent with the @xmath030% ( sub)mm detection rate at lower reshift ( eg .",
    "carilli et al .",
    "2001 ; omont et al . 2001 ; 2003 ) .",
    "the observational data imply fir luminosities @xmath149 in the ( sub)mm detected sources .",
    "+ * we compare the distribution of fir luminosities and fir to optical ratios between the z@xmath06 sdss sample and ( sub)mm observed optically bright quasars ( @xmath150 ) at lower reshifts .",
    "the distributions of the fir - optical ratio are similar for different redshift groups , which suggests that the average optical - to - fir sed of optically bright quasars is independent of redshift .",
    "+ * we extend the quasar fir - to - optical correlation study to the z@xmath06 sdss sample .",
    "no correlation is found with the z@xmath06 sample only .",
    "however , a correlation ( albeit with large scatter ) can be seen when all the samples extending from z=1.5 to 6.42 are included .",
    "+ * we also discussed the fir - to - radio ratios of the z@xmath06 quasars , by comparing them to the typical correlation defined by star forming galaxies .",
    "three of the four sources that are detected in both the millimeter and radio bands have fir - to - radio ratios within the range defined by star forming galaxies .",
    "+ * we found no strong radio sources with @xmath151 among the new sdss sources of bright z@xmath06 quasars . in the whole z@xmath06 sample ,",
    "only one radio detection has a radio to optical ratio @xmath152 and no source has @xmath153 .",
    "these data are consistent with , although do not set strong constraints on , the recent conclusion of a decreasing radio loud quasar fraction with increasing redshift ( jiang et al . 2006b ) .",
    "+    these results give a view of the general fir through radio properties of the z@xmath06 sdss quasars .",
    "the data are consistent with the idea that massive starbursts may exist in the host galaxies of the strong ( sub)mm detections at z@xmath06 and contribute to the fir and radio emission . these strong ( sub)mm sources provide the only candidates to search for co and @xmath154 into the epoch of reionization , and to test the idea of co - eval smbh and host galaxy formation .",
