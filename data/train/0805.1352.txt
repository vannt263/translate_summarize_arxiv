    "lattice calculations indicate a rapid transition from a confined hadronic phase to a chirally symmetric de - confined quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) at the critical temperature @xmath3  mev @xcite .",
    "such a plasma is produced in energetic au+au collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider rhic .",
    "however , it is currently unclear whether the phase transition to the qgp phase is first order ( @xmath4 ) or a rapid crossover reflecting an increase in the entropy density associated with the change from hadronic ( @xmath5 ) to quark and gluon ( @xmath6 ) degrees of freedom .    an emitting system which undergoes a first order phase transition",
    "is predicted to have a large space - time extent @xcite .",
    "this is because the transition `` softens '' the equation of state ( ie . the sound speed @xmath7 ) in the transition region , and this delays the expansion and considerably prolongs the lifetime of the system .",
    "a smaller space - time extent has been predicted for systems which undergo a crossover transition @xcite .    to search for a prolonged lifetime , it has been a common practice to measure the widths ( @xmath8 ) of the emission source function ( assumed to be gaussian ) in the out- side- and long - direction ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) of the bertsch - pratt coordinate system @xcite . here",
    ", the prediction is that @xmath12 , for systems which undergo a first order phase transition , @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1_rischke_routrside ] , where the values obtained from a hydrodynamical model calculation @xcite are plotted as a function of energy density ( in units of @xmath13 ; @xmath14 is the entropy density ) .",
    "c0.5     these rather large ratios ( cf . figs .  [ fig1_rischke_routrside]a and c ) have served as a major motivating factor for experimental searches at several accelerator facilities @xcite .",
    "no evidence for a prolonged lifetime were found by these studies and the reported gaussian source functions are spheroidal with @xmath15 in the longitudinally co - moving system .",
    "a crossover transition can be modeled by varying the width @xmath16 , of the transition region .",
    "[ fig1_rischke_routrside]a and b show that the magnitude of @xmath17 is considerably reduced ( by as much as a factor of four ) when calculations are performed for @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the space - time extent of the emitting system is significantly influenced by the cross over transition and this could lead to less prominent signals which require more sensitive methods of detection .",
    "indeed , a recent study with a 1d source imaging technique has observed a long non - gaussian tail in the radial source function and attributed it to possible lifetime effects  @xcite .    in this contribution , we report on recent efforts to study the 3d two - pion source function via a new state - of - the - art technique proposed by danielewicz and pratt  @xcite .",
    "namely , the 3d correlation function is first decomposed into a basis of cartesian surface - spherical harmonics to extract the coefficients , also called moments , of the expansion .",
    "they are then imaged or fitted with a trial function to extract the 3d source function , which is then used to probe the emission dynamics of the pion source @xcite .",
    "the 3d correlation function @xmath19 was obtained by taking the ratio of the 3d relative momentum distribution for @xmath20 and @xmath21 pairs in the same event @xmath22 and those from mixed events @xmath23 , where @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the momentum 4-vectors in the pair center of mass system ( pcms ) .",
    "the 3d correlation function @xmath27 was expanded in a cartesian harmonic basis  @xcite to obtain the moments @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 are cartesian harmonic basis elements ; ( @xmath32 is the solid angle in @xmath33 space ) ; @xmath34 are cartesian correlation moments given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn2 ] ) ; and @xmath35 is the modulus of @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37    r0.5     here , the coordinate axes are oriented so that @xmath38 ( long ) is parallel to the beam direction and @xmath39 ( out ) points in the direction of the total transverse momentum of the pair . for this analysis , eq .",
    "( [ eqn1 ] ) was truncated at @xmath40 and expressed in terms of its 10 independent even moments : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( @xmath42 is shorthand for @xmath51 @xcite ) ; odd moments were checked and found to be consistent with zero [ within statistical uncertainty ] as required by symmetry considerations ; higher order moments ( for @xmath52 ) were also checked and found to be negligible .",
    "the independent moments are shown as a function of @xmath35 in fig .",
    "[ phnx_fig1_ppg76 ] .",
    "they were obtained by fitting the truncated series to the measured 3d correlation function with the moments as the parameters of the fit .",
    "it is noteworthy that the very good agreement between @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( shown in panel ( a ) ) points to the absence of any significant angular acceptance issues .",
    "it also attests to the reliability of the moment extraction technique . @xmath53 and",
    "@xmath54 both represent angle - averaged correlation functions , but @xmath53 is obtained from the 3d correlation function via eq .",
    "( [ eqn2 ] ) while @xmath54 is evaluated directly from the 1d correlation function as in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the 3d source function @xmath55 is obtained from the moments via imaging or fitting .",
    "this is made transparent by the observation that , in analogy to eq .",
    "( [ eqn1 ] ) , @xmath55 can also be expanded in a cartesian surface - spherical harmonic basis @xmath56 if the series for @xmath57 and @xmath55 are now substituted into the 3d koonin - pratt equation ; @xmath58 then , the following set of 1d expressions ( eq .  ( [ momkpeqn ] ) )",
    "@xcite which relate the correlation moments @xmath34 to the source moments @xmath59 are obtained ; @xmath60 here , it should be noted that @xmath55 gives the probability of emitting a pair of particles with a separation vector @xmath61 in the pcms and the 3d kernel , @xmath62 , incorporates both the coulomb force and the bose - einstein symmetrization .",
    "the 1d imaging code of brown and danielewicz  @xcite was used to numerically invert each correlation moment @xmath34 to extract the corresponding source moment @xmath59 .",
    "the latter were then combined as in eq .",
    "( [ eqn3 ] ) , to give the source function .",
    "the 3d source function was also extracted via direct fits to the 3d correlation function with an empirical hump function given by @xmath63 ,     \\label{hump_eqn}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 are fit parameters and @xmath65 $ ] , @xmath66 .",
    "this procedure corresponds to a simultaneous fit of the ten independent moments .",
    "the solid curves in fig .",
    "[ phnx_fig1_ppg76 ] show the results of such a a fit .",
    "they indicate that the 8-parameter hump function achieves a good fit to the data ( @xmath67ndf=1.4 ) .",
    "r0.5   -0.8 cm    figures  [ phnx_fig2_ppg76](a)-(c ) show the source function profiles s@xmath68 , s@xmath69 and s@xmath70 obtained via fitting ( line ) and source imaging ( squares ) .",
    "s@xmath68 is characterized by a long tail , which is resolved up to @xmath7160  fm ; s@xmath69 and s@xmath70 are resolved up to @xmath7125  fm .",
    "the corresponding correlation profiles obtained by summation of the data ( circle ) , fit ( line ) and image ( square ) moments are shown in figs .  [",

    "[ phnx_fig2_ppg76](a ) and ( d ) ) , as expected .",
    "the extended tail lies along the pair total transverse momentum .",
    "thus , the relative emission times between pions , as well as the source geometry , will contribute to s@xmath68 .",
    "the source lifetime contributes to the range of s@xmath70 and s@xmath69 reflects its mean transverse geometric size .",
    "the difference between s@xmath68 and s@xmath69 is thus driven by the combination of the emission time difference , freeze - out dynamics and kinematic lorentz boost .",
    "c0.5   -1.cm    to aid interpretation of the source function , the event generator therminator  @xcite was used to predict source functions for several model scenarios .",
    "therminator provides thermal emissions ( including all known resonance decays ) from a longitudinally oriented , boost invariant cylinder of radius @xmath73 .",
    "a differential fluid element is a ring defined by cylindrical coordinates @xmath38 and @xmath74 ; it breaks up at proper time @xmath1 in its rest frame or at time @xmath75 in the lab frame , where @xmath76 .",
    "the freeze - out hypersurface is given by @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the proper breakup time for @xmath790 and @xmath80 represents the slope of the freeze - out hypersurface in @xmath74-@xmath1 space ; for @xmath81 particles at small @xmath74 s are emitted at earlier times i.e inside - out `` burning '' ; outside - in `` burning '' occurs for @xmath82 .",
    "calculations were performed in blast - wave mode for a set of parameters tuned to fit charged pion and kaon spectra .",
    "in addition , transverse expansion [ governed by a radial velocity @xmath83 semi - linear in @xmath74 , i.e. @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) ] was assumed and @xmath80 was varied .",
    "the mid - rapidity pion pairs so obtained were also generated with the effects of all known resonance decay processes on and off .",
    "the resulting pairs were then transformed to the pcms , as in the data analysis , to obtain s@xmath86 distributions for comparison with the data .",
    "figure  [ phnx_fig3_ppg76 ] shows that the 3d source function generated by therminator calculations ( open triangles ) with @xmath87  fm / c , @xmath88  fm and @xmath89 with resonances on , reproduce s(@xmath90 ) but do not fully account for the long tails in @xmath39 and @xmath38 ie .",
    "the latter are longer than the therminator source profiles .",
    "for the same parameters , the calculations underestimates s@xmath68 , s(@xmath90 ) and s@xmath70 when resonances are turned off ( solid triangles ) .",
    "reasonable attempts to fit the distributions by only increasing @xmath78 or with @xmath91 failed , suggesting substantial contribution from pion pairs with significantly longer emission time differences .    an alternative approach to lengthen",
    "the distribution of time differences between pion pairs is to sample them from a family of hypersurfaces defined by a range of values of proper breakup times @xmath92 .",
    "one such parametrization consists of replacing @xmath1 by @xmath92 chosen from an exponential distribution @xmath93 $ ] , where the width of the distribution @xmath2 represents the mean proper emission duration .",
    "figure  [ phnx_fig3_ppg76 ] shows that this approach , with @xmath94  fm / c ( open circles ) , leads to a fairly good match to the three observed source profiles .",
    "figure  [ phnx_fig3_ppg76](d ) summarizes the relative emission time distribution in the lcms , @xmath95 , for pion pairs from events with the parameterizations indicated . for a fixed @xmath87  fm / c ( @xmath96 ) and resonance decays excluded , the distribution @xmath95 is narrow , @xmath97  fm / c .",
    "the addition of resonance decays adds a long tail and gives @xmath98  fm / c .",
    "replacing @xmath1 with the exponential distribution @xmath92 with @xmath99  fm / c , results in a @xmath95 distribution which is significantly broadened to give @xmath100  fm / c .",
    "the wider distribution of time delays is needed to reproduce the source distributions .",
    "this implies a non - zero proper emission duration in the emission rest frame .",
    "figure  [ phnx_fig3_ppg76 ] shows that substantial time differences @xmath95 are required to account for the source distensions ; however , the interplay between proper time and breakup dynamics is model dependent .",
    "nevertheless , the picture which emerges from the therminator model comparison is consistent with an expanding fireball ( @xmath88  fm ) with proper breakup time @xmath101  fm / c , which hadronizes and emits particles over a short but non - zero mean proper emission duration @xmath102  fm / c .",
    "such a short time duration is incompatible with the predictions @xcite for a first order phase transition .",
    "in conclusion , a novel three - dimensional source imaging technique has been used to extract the 3d pion emission source function in the pcms frame from au+au collisions at @xmath103  gev .",
    "the source function has a much greater extent in the out ( @xmath39 ) and long ( @xmath38 ) , than in the side ( @xmath104 ) direction .",
    "therminator model comparisons suggest an emission source ( @xmath88  fm ) burning from outside in with proper lifetime @xmath101  fm / c and a mean proper emission duration @xmath105  fm / c . these emission characteristics are incompatible with the predictions for a first order phase transition . however , they point to significant relative emission times ( @xmath106  fm / c , including those due to resonance decay ) which could result from a crossover phase transition .",
