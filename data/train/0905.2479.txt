    "[ dubois ]    while this paper was nearing completion , we were informed that alternative complex hilbert metrics , based on the poincare metric in the right - half complex plane , were recently introduced in rugh  @xcite and dubois  @xcite .",
    "contractiveness with respect to these metrics is proven in great generality and yields far - reaching consequences for complex perron - frobenius theory .",
    "the proofs of contractiveness in these papers seem rather different from the calculus approach in our paper .",
    "the complex hilbert metric , which we call @xmath146 , used in  @xcite ( see equation ( 3.23 ) ) is explicit and natural , but slightly more complicated than our complex hilbert metric ; for @xmath147 , @xmath148 here @xmath149 denotes complex conjugate , @xmath150 denotes real part , and @xmath21 is the ordinary real logarithm . in the 2-dimensional case , it can be verified that , if one transforms @xmath151 and @xmath152 to @xmath153 and @xmath154 , then @xmath146 reduces to the poincare metric on @xmath124 : @xmath155 using the infinitesimal form for the poincare metric ( as a riemannian metric on @xmath124 ) , one checks that , in the @xmath117 case , the lipschitz constant for a complex matrix @xmath58 such that @xmath156 is : @xmath157 in contrast to @xmath158 for our complex hilbert metric ( as in example  [ 2by2 ] above ) .",
    "while we have not analyzed in detail the differences between these metrics , there are a few things that can be said in the @xmath117 case :    * @xmath63 is a contraction with respect to @xmath146 on @xmath124 whenever it maps @xmath124 into its interior ; this follows from standard complex analysis ( section ix.3 of of  @xcite ) , and dubois  @xcite proves an analog of this for the metric @xmath146 above ( [ dp ] ) in higher dimensions . however",
    ", this does not hold for @xmath23 .",
    "* when @xmath159 is strictly positive , then the contraction coefficient , with respect to @xmath146 , is always at least as good ( i.e. , at most ) the contraction coefficient with respect to @xmath23 .",
    "this can be seen as follows : + first recall that any fractional linear transformation @xmath9 can be expressed as the composition of transitions , dilations and inversions . in the case where @xmath9 is strictly positive ,",
    "the translations are by positive real numbers and the dilations are by real numbers ; see page 65 of  @xcite",
    ". using the infinitesimal forms ( [ inf - poincare ] , [ inf - hilbert ] ) , our assertion would follow from : @xmath160 this is true indeed : it is easy to see that in fact we get equality in ( [ ineq ] ) for inversions and dilations by real numbers , and we get strict inequality in ( [ ineq ] ) for translations by positive real numbers .",
    "* when @xmath58 is a complex perturbation of a strictly positive @xmath9 , then ( [ ineq ] ) ( with @xmath9 replaced by @xmath58 ) need not hold ; in fact , for perturbations @xmath58 of @xmath9 on the order of 1% and @xmath161 , with @xmath162 on the order of 1% , the contraction coefficient with respect to @xmath23 may be slightly smaller than that with respect to @xmath146 .",
    "the reason is that in this case , the dilations may be complex ( non - real ) and for such a dilation the inequality ( [ ineq ] ) may be reversed .",
    "examples of this can be randomly generated in matlab .",
    "for example , if @xmath163\\ ] ] and @xmath164 , then the contraction coefficent of @xmath23 is approximately 0.664396 and that of @xmath146 is approximately 0.664599 . for larger perturbations ,",
    "the differences in contraction coefficient can be greater .",
    "the relative strength of contraction of @xmath165 seems to be heavily dependent on specific choices of @xmath58 and @xmath166 .",
    "* for any point @xmath166 , other than 0 , of the imaginary axis , the metric @xmath23 can be extended to a neighbourhood , with respect to which any sufficiently small complex perturbation @xmath58 of a strictly positive matrix acts as a contraction ; on the other hand , there is no way to do this with @xmath146 since it blows up as one approaches the imaginary axis .",
    "* also , on a small punctured neighbourhood of @xmath167 , we replace @xmath23 by the metric @xmath168 , then small complex perturbation @xmath58 of a strictly positive matrix still acts as a contraction .    in the next section ,",
    "we use @xmath23 for estimates on the domain of analyticity of entropy rate of a hidden markov process .",
    "alternatively , @xmath146 could be used , however it appears to be computationally easier to use @xmath23 for the estimation .",
    "for @xmath169 with @xmath170 , we denote a sequence of symbols @xmath171 by @xmath172 . consider a stationary stochastic process @xmath173 with a finite set of states @xmath174 and distribution @xmath175 .",

    "one checks that @xmath210 can be recovered from this dynamical system ; more specifically , we have @xmath211    if the entries of @xmath212 are analytically parameterized by a real variable vector @xmath213 ( @xmath88 is a positive integer ) , then we obtain a family @xmath214 and corresponding @xmath215 , @xmath216 , etc .

    "@xcite this result is stated in greater generality , allowing some entries of @xmath181 to be zero . the proof is based on an analysis of the action of perturbations of @xmath198 on neighbourhoods of @xmath221 , with respect to the euclidean metric .",
    "the proof assumes that each @xmath198 is a contraction on each @xmath222 .",
    "while this need not hold , one can arrange for this to be true by replacing the original system with a higher power system : namely , one replaces the original alphabet @xmath223 with @xmath224 for some @xmath201 and replaces the mappings @xmath225 with @xmath226 .",
