    "a curvature invariant of order @xmath0 is a scalar obtained by contraction from a polynomial in the  riemann tensor and its covariant derivatives up to the  order @xmath0 .",
    "in general there are 14 algebraically independent curvature invariants of zeroth order , the  simplest being the  ricci scalar .",
    "many papers are devoted to studying the properties of the  zeroth order curvature invariants ( see @xcite  @xcite and references therein ) but higher order curvature invariants remain largely unexplored .",
    "recently it was shown that for spacetimes in which the  ricci tensor does not possess a null eigenvector , an appropriately chosen set of zeroth order curvature invariants contains all of the information that is present in the  riemann tensor @xcite .",
    "this is certainly not true for vacuum petrov type n spacetimes with nonzero expansion or twist , all of whose zeroth and first order curvature invariants vanish , but for which there are non - vanishing curvature invariants of the  second order @xcite ; and for some non - flat spacetimes in which all curvature invariants of all orders vanish @xcite-@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we shall determine all lorentzian spacetimes for which all curvature invariants of all orders are zero .",
    "indeed , we shall prove the  following :    [ th : main ] all curvature invariants of all orders vanish if and only if the  following two conditions are satisfied :    1 .",
    "the spacetime possesses a non - diverging sfr ( shear - free , geodesic null congruence ) .",
    "2 .   relative to the  above null congruence , all curvature scalars with non - negative boost - weight vanish .",
    "the analytic form of the  condition ( a ) , expressed relative to any spin basis where @xmath1 is aligned with the  null congruence in question , is simply @xmath2 and the  analytic form of condition ( b ) is @xmath3    spacetimes that satisfy condition ( a ) belong to kundt s class @xcite ( also , see section  [ sect : spacetimes ] and [ ap : kundt ] ) . condition ( b ) implies that the  spacetime is of petrov type iii , n , or o ( see eq .",

    "this is important for this work , and we shall summarize some of the  key details of this notion in the  next section .",
    "the outline for the rest of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sect : sufficient ] is devoted to the  proof that the  above conditions are sufficient for vanishing of curvature invariants .",
    "the  `` necessary '' part of theorem 1 is proved in section  [ sect : necessary ] .",
    "the curvature invariants constructed in this section may be also useful for computer - aided classification of spacetimes .",
    "kundt s class of spacetimes admits a conveniently specialized system of coordinates , and so it is possible to classify and explicitly describe all spacetimes with vanishing curvature invariants .",
    "this is briefly summarized in section  [ sect : spacetimes ] , and some of the details are presented in [ ap : kundt ] .",
    "we conclude with a discussion .",
    "perhaps the  best known class of spacetimes with vanishing curvature invariants are the pp - waves ( or plane - fronted gravitational waves with parallel rays ) , which are characterized as ricci - flat ( vacuum ) type n spacetimes that admit a covariantly constant null vector field .",
    "the  vanishing of curvature invariants in pp - wave spacetimes has been known for a long time @xcite , and the  spacetimes obtained here can perhaps be regarded as extensions and generalizations of these important spacetimes . in many applications ( e.g. , in vacuum pp - wave spacetimes )",
    "the  resulting exact solutions have a five - dimensional isometry group acting on three - dimensional null orbits ( which includes translations in the  transverse direction along the  wave front ) and hence the  solutions are plane waves",
    ". however , the  solutions studied here need not be plane waves , and are not necessarily vacuum solutions .",
    "in particular , non - vacuum spacetimes with a covariantly constant null vector are often referred to as generalized pp - wave and typically have no further symmetries ( the  arbitrary function in the  metric is not subject to a further differential equation , namely laplace s equation , when the  ricci tensor has the  form of null radiation ) .",
    "the pp - wave spacetimes have a number of remarkable symmetry properties and have been the  subject of much research @xcite . for example , the  existence of a homothety in spacetimes with plane wave symmetry and the  scaling properties of generally covariant field equations has been used to show that all generally covariant scalars are constant @xcite and that metrics with plane wave symmetry trivially satisfy every system of generally covariant vacuum field equations _ except _ the  einstein equations @xcite .",
    "in addition to pp - waves , presently there are known to be three classes of metrics with vanishing curvature invariants : the conformally flat pure radiation spacetime given in @xcite ; the vacuum petrov type - n nonexpanding and nontwisting spacetimes @xcite ( this class contains the  pp - waves ) ; and vacuum petrov type - iii nonexpanding and nontwisting spacetimes @xcite . naturally all of these spacetimes are subcases of the  class studied here .",
    "the spacetimes studied in @xcite also belong to our class .",
    "there are two important applications of the class of spacetimes obtained in this paper .",
    "a knowledge of all lorentzian spacetimes for which all of the  curvature invariants constructed from the  riemann tensor and its covariant derivatives are zero , which implies that all covariant two - tensors constructed thus are zero except for the  ricci tensor , will be of potential relevance in the  equivalence problem and the  classification of spacetimes , and may be a useful first step toward addressing the  important question of when a spacetime can be uniquely characterized by its curvature invariants .",
    "more importantly perhaps , the  spacetimes obtained in this paper are also of physical interest .",
    "for example , pp - wave spacetimes are exact solutions in string theory ( to all perturbative orders in the  string tension ) @xcite and they are of importance in quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "it is likely that all of the  spacetimes for which all of the  curvature invariants vanish will have similar applications and it would be worthwhile investigating these metrics further .",
    "finally , we note that it is possible to generalize theorem  [ th : main ] by including spacetimes with non - vanishing cosmological constant .",
    "the  assumptions regarding the  weyl and traceless ricci tensors remain the  same . even in this general case , the  invariants constructed from the  weyl tensor ,",
    "the  traceless ricci tensor and their arbitrary covariant derivatives vanish .",
    "the  only non - vanishing curvature invariants are order zero curvature invariants constructed as various polynomials of the  cosmological constant",
    ". it must be noted , however , that there may exist other types of spacetimes with constant curvature invariants .",
    "before tackling the  proof of the main theorem , we make some necessary definitions and establish a number of auxiliary results .",
    "we shall make use of the  newmann - penrose ( np ) and the  compacted ( ghp ) formalisms @xcite . throughout",
