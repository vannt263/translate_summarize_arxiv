    "studies of circular polarisation from jets , and indeed of relativistic jets in general , have traditionally focussed on active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . however , in the past decade or so it has become clear that relativistic jets from x - ray binaries , also known as ` microquasars ' ( mirabel et al . 1992 ) , share many of the properties ( observationally , and therefore almost certainly physically ) of their extragalactic cousins . furthermore , due to the huge mass ratio @xmath0 , we may probe timescales associated with accretion and jet formation by observing x - ray binaries which would be humanly impossible for agn ( e.g. sams , eckart & sunyaev 1996 ) . for recent reviews of jets from x - ray binaries ,",
    "see mirabel & rodriguez ( 1999 ) , fender ( 2003 ) . in this paper",
    "i shall first discuss in detail observations of circularly polarised radio emission from the ` microquasar ' grs 1915 + 105 (  2 ) , and then compare it to observations of circularly polarised radio emission from other x - ray binaries (  3 ) .",
    "in this section we present observations of circular polarisation associated with relativistic ejections from the x - ray binary jet source ( ` microquasar ' ) grs 1915 + 105 , as well as some preliminary interpretations .",
    "these results have been published in fender et al .",
    "( 2002b ) .      in fig 1",
    "we show radio and soft x - ray monitoring of grs 1915 + 105 , over a 150-day period .",
    "the radio monitoring data were obtained with the ryle telescope ( rt ) , at a frequency of 15 ghz ; for a more detailed description of this monitoring program see pooley & fender ( 1997 ) .",
    "the x - ray data are from the _ rossi_xte all - sky monitor ( asm ) and measure the total flux in the 2 - 12 kev band .",
    "rossi_xte asm is described in levine et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and the public data can be obtained at * http://xte.mit.edu*.    indicated in the top panels of fig 1 are the times of our two atca and multiple merlin observations of grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "the australia telescope compact array ( atca ; frater , brooks & whiteoak 1992 ) has a number of design features which enable very accurate circular polarization measurements . the low antenna cross - polarization and high polarization stability enable accurate calibration of polarization leakage terms , and the linearly - polarized feed design largely isolates stokes v from contamination by stokes i.    atca observed grs 1915 + 105 twice , for six hours each , on 2001 january 17 and 2001 march 23 . during the january observations ,",
    "simultaneous observations at 1384 mhz and 2496 mhz were interleaved with observations at 4800 mhz and 8640 mhz ; for the march observations , only 4800 mhz and 8640 mhz were observed .",
    "for both epochs the array was in a ` 6 km ' configuration , for which the lack of short baselines served to reduce confusion from other galactic sources .",
    "the observation and calibration procedures were similar to those described in fender et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .    as discussed in fender et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , calibration of circular polarization data requires the `` strongly - polarized '' calibration equations ( sault , killeen & kesteven , 1991 ) , using a point - source with a few percent linear polarization .",
    "this is needed to calibrate the leakage of linear polarization into circular .",
    "for the 4800 mhz and 8640mhz observations , the vla calibrator 1923 + 210 was used as a polarization calibrator for both epochs .",
    "calibrator confusion and low linear polarization , however , precluded the use of any of the observed calibrators as polarization calibrators for the january 1384 mhz and 2496 mhz observations . as a result , we were forced to use calibration solutions derived using the `` weakly - polarized '' equations with the atca primary calibrator , 1934 - 638 .",
    "the use of the `` weakly - polarized '' equations will cause a time - varying leakage of linear polarization into circular . in tests , peak leakages of 5% of the linear polarization into circular have been observed . for the 1384 mhz observations ,",
    "the low linear polarization of grs 1915 + 105 implies the effect of such leakage is negligible .",
    "even for the 2496 mhz observations , where the linear polarization rises rapidly during the observation , in the _ worst - case _ the leakage would be only half the stokes v error due to thermal noise .",
    "the full polarisation atca data for both epochs are presented in fig 2 .",
    "the multi element radio linked interferometer network ( merlin ) consists of six individual antennae with a typical diameter of 25 m and a maximum baseline of 217 km ( thomasson 1986 ) .",
    "the observations presented here were undertaken in continuum mode at a frequency of 4994 mhz with a total bandwidth of 16 mhz .",
    "as merlin measures all four correlation products as a matter of course when in this mode , full polarimetric information can be derived from all images .",
    "ongoing work is seeking to establish the reliability of stokes v measurements with merlin ; these will not be reported here .",
    "grs 1915 + 105 was observed eleven times with merlin following the flare observed on 2001 , march 22/23 .",
    "the first five epochs , corresponding to daily observations between 2001 march 24 and march 27 and again on march 29 , are presented in this paper ( fig 3 ) ; further details and analysis of the full set of merlin observations will be published in mccormick et al .",
    "( in prep ) . in each case",
    "a flux calibrator , 3c286 , a point source , oq208 , and a phase calibrator , 1919 + 086 , were included in the observing schedule .",
    "the flux calibrator and point source calibrator were observed at the beginning and end of the run whilst the rest of the observation was devoted to a cycle of 1.5 minutes on the phase calibrator and 5 minutes on grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "initial data editing and calibration were performed using the standard merlin d - programs and the data were then transferred to the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ) . within aips",
    "the data were processed via the merlin pipeline , which calibrates and images the phase reference source and then applies these solutions to the target source .",
    "this process also derives instrumental polarisation corrections and calibrates the linear polarisation position angle , using 3c286 as the calibrator and assuming a position angle of @xmath1 for its e vector .",
    "the position angles measured by merlin and atca are consistent with the same value , independently confirming the position angle calibration of each array .",
    "further self calibration was then carried out within aips and grs 1915 + 105 imaged in total intensity and stokes q and u. these maps were then combined using the aips task pcntr to produce the final maps with total intensity contours and vectors denoting the direction and strength of linear polarisation .",
    "note that we can be confident both from previous studies ( e.g. mirabel & rodriguez 1994 ; fender et al .",
    "1999 ) and these data ( mccormick et al . in prep )",
    "that the component(s ) to the south east ( labelled in fig 3 as ` se1 ' ) is ` approaching ' , and component(s ) to the north west are ` receding ' ( although in fact both sides of the jet have doppler factors @xmath2 ) .      in both sets of atca observations ,",
    "grs 1915 + 105 is unambiguously detected as a source of circularly polarised radio emission ( stokes v ) .      in 2001",
    "january ( fig 2 , left panels ) , significant",
    "cp is measured at all four atca frequencies , from 19 ghz .",
    "the total flux density is clearly declining , indicating the decay phase of a major flare , but there is also significant variability superposed on the relatively smooth decline , preferentially at higher frequencies .",
    "this is almost certainly indicative of repeated activity in the core , corresponding to fresh ejection events .",
    "the spectral indices support this interpretation ; between 1.42.9 ghz the spectrum is significantly flatter than expected for optically thin synchrotron emission ; between 4.88.6 ghz it is displaying the rapidly varying behaviour associated with ` core ' ejection events ( fender et al .",
    ".    inspection of the total flux and spectral index light curves indicates there were at least four separate ejection events contributing to the light curve at this epoch .",
    "fig 1 also indicates that this outburst was more prolonged than that in 2001 march ( see below ) .",
    "the cp flux is clearly rising to lower frequencies , but the exact fractional spectrum is difficult to determine as the multiple components contributing to the observed emission are unresolved with atca .",
    "table 1 lists the mean total , linearly polarised and circularly polarised flux densities , and fig 4 plots these both as total and fractional spectra .",
    "we also note that there are measurements when the stokes v flux is not significantly non - zero , and even a few points where it appears to have changed sign . however , ( i ) the mean stokes v fluxes are significant , and negative ( at both epochs ) , ( ii ) the apparent stokes v sign change has a significance @xmath3 and so we do not consider it convincing .",
    "[ march01 ]    [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     it is interesting to note that the three sources from which cp has been strongly detected have jets which are close to the plane of the sky ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "however , the jets from cir x-1 , v 4641 sgr and cyg x-3 are believed to be very close to the line of sight ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the limits on the cp from cyg x-3 and v 4641 are particularly stringent .",
    "the limits obtained on cp in both cases are between 510 times below the levels of v / i detected from ss 433 , grs 1915 + 105 and gro j1655 - 40 .",
    "this indeed seems like a hint that cp , at least from x - ray binaries , is stronger when the jet is viewed approximately ` side on ' .",
    "however , it should also be noted that both sources show evidence ( either on the specific occasion or others ) for a strongly self - absorbed outburst , unlike e.g. ss 433 which is nearly always optically thin .",
    "in addition , the orientation effect would be rather contrary to the observations of agn , in which strong cp is observed from ` blazars ' with approximately face - on jets ( e.g. homan et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "both homan et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and brunthaler et al .",
    "( 2001 ) investigate the ratio of circular to linear polarisation .",
    "specifically , brunthaler et al .",
    "( 2001 ) define r@xmath6 as the ratio of fractional cp to fractional lp , and find that r@xmath7 for the two low - luminosity agn ( llagn ) m81 * and sgr a * between 115 ghz ( in fact no lp is detected at all from these sources ) .",
    "homan et al . , ( 2001 ) present 5 ghz measurements for many blazars , with significant measurements of both lp and cp for sixteen sources , and find for all of these that r@xmath8 .    we have already seen ( fig 4 ) that for grs 1915 + 105 , at the lowest frequency r@xmath7 , whereas for the other three higher frequencies r@xmath8 . in fig 7 i plot r@xmath6 as a function of frequency for both grs 1915 + 105 and ss 433 , two epochs for each source . in both cases r@xmath7 for the lowest frequency ( 1.4 ghz ) and r@xmath8 for the three higher frequencies",
    "this seems to imply that whether r@xmath6 is greater or less than unity depends on the degree of faraday depolarisation in the emitting plasma .",
    "it should be noted that for the x - ray binary gro j1655 - 40 , which showed a high degree of linear polarisation , r@xmath8 at all frequencies ( macquart et al .",
    "2002 ) .    in fig 8 i plot fractional cp against fractional lp for these two x - ray binaries , plus the two llagn and the most significant detections from the blazar sample of homan et al .",
    "the two groups of agn are separated by the line corresponding to lp = cp , whereas the x - ray binaries lie either side of the line depending on frequency .",
    "it is interesting to note that , since for both llagn there are only upper limits on lp , it is only for the low - frequency observations of the x - ray binaries that the exact value of r@xmath8 , when it is less than unity , has been measured .",
    "circularly polarised radio emission has been clearly detected from three x - ray binaries , all of which are associated with powerful jets which share many of the characteristics of agn . in the cases of both grs 1915 + 105 and gro j1655 - 40 ,",
    "strong and variable circular polarisation was associated with clearly resolved ejection events . comparing the fractional circular polarisation spectrum , and circular to linear polarisation ratio ,",
    "clear similarities with agn are noted .",
    "in particular , multi - frequency measurements of x - ray binaries , which reveal that the circular to linear polarisation ratio increases with wavelength , support interpretations in which the dominant factor for this ratio is the degree of faraday depolarisation in the source .",
    "the author would like to thank all the participants at the workshop in amsterdam for many discussions , some useful , some useless but amusing .",
    "in addition , he would like to thank ger de bruyn and bob sault for providing information on unpublished results ."
