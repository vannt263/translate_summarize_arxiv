    "interval observers @xcite are an interesting class of observers that can be used to estimate upper- and lower - bounds on the state value of a given system at any given time .",
    "the rationale for using such observers lies in the fact that when the observed system is subject to disturbances or uncertainties , estimation errors are often unavoidable , unless decoupling is possible .",
    "when this happens , then it becomes unclear in which region the state currently lies .",
    "this problem is elegantly resolved , among others , by the use of interval observers that will estimate an upper- and a lower - bound on the current state - value , thereby explicitly defining an interval where the state lies within . in this respect ,",
    "interval observers are highly relevant in the context of observation of systems for which only a poor model is available , like in fields such as ecology , epidemiology or biology ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "interval observers have been already considered for systems with inputs @xcite , linear systems @xcite , uncertain systems @xcite , time - varying systems @xcite , delay systems @xcite , nonlinear systems @xcite , lpv systems @xcite , discrete - time systems @xcite , for stabilization @xcite , etc .",
    "the underlying idea is to design an observer in a way that makes the observation errors nonnegative over time , which is equivalent to having error dynamics represented by a positive system @xcite .",
    "this positivity property is very important to consider because of the interesting properties of positive systems .",
    "it is indeed now well - known that their stability @xcite and their @xmath0-/@xmath1-gain can be established using finite - dimensional linear programs @xcite .",
    "we hence consider here a simple class of interval observers and propose a methodology for designing them so that the @xmath1-gain of the operator mapping the persistent input errors ( disturbances ) to the observed output  a weighted version of the observation errors  is minimum ; see e.g. @xcite . by doing so ,",
    "we simply attempt to minimize the influence of the disturbances on the width of the interval in a peak - to - peak sense .",
    "it is also important to stress that , in this context , considering bounded and persistent disturbances ( i.e. in @xmath1 ) seems more relevant than considering vanishing ones , as in the @xmath0 and in the @xmath2 frameworks , as the disturbances may depend on persistent exogenous signals or on the state of the process .",
    "the general control / observation / filtering problems are reputed to be difficult in this framework ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the approach proposed in this paper is different than the one that could have been based on the so - called @xmath3-norm @xcite which is known to be a loose characterization of the peak - to - peak gain as minimizing the @xmath3-norm does not necessarily result in a small peak - to - peak norm ; see e.g.@xcite .",
    "the approach is also different from the one considered in the context of set - valued observers @xcite that aims at estimating the set of all possible states based on the knowledge of the output of the system and a model of the exogenous signals .",
    "these observers are known to be difficult to implement in real - time due to a high computational burden .",
    "the approach considered in this paper is instead based on positive systems theory and leads to both constructive and nonconservative design conditions that take the form of tractable finite - dimensional linear programs , thereby circumventing the inherent difficulties of the design of general optimal peak - to - peak observers .",
    "interestingly , the optimal interval observer is uniform over all the possible values for the matrix parameter that maps the observation errors to the performance outputs .",
    "this essentially means that changing the performance specifications ( i.e. the performance output ) will not require the re - design of the optimal interval - observer .",
    "note , however , that the performance level , i.e. the actual @xmath1-gain , is not uniform and will actually vary when the performance output is changed .",
    "this property is dual to the one obtained in @xcite that states that the optimal state - feedback controller that minimizes the @xmath0-gain of the closed - loop system is uniform over the set of all the possible values for the input matrices driving the disturbance into the system .",
    "finally , it seems important to mention that even though the class of problems we consider in this paper may seem restrictive , it is demonstrated that the proposed approach extends , among others , to more complex observers , to systems with delays and to discrete - time systems in a very natural way .    * outline . *",
    "section [ sec : prel ] introduces the considered norms for signals and systems , as well as tools for computing them whenever the considered systems are positive .",
    "the problem of designing @xmath1-to-@xmath1 interval - observers for continuous - time systems with persistent disturbances is solved in section [ sec : obs ] .",
    "examples are discussed in section [ sec : ex ] .",

    "then its @xmath1-gain ( or @xmath0-norm ) is defined as @xmath25      let us start with fundamental definitions :    a matrix @xmath26 is said to be metzler if all its off - diagonal entries are nonnegative.@xmath21    let us consider the following system @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are the state of the system , the initial condition , the input and the output .",

    "let us consider now the following system @xmath51 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath52 are the state of the system , the initial condition , the persistent disturbance input and the measured output .",
    "note that this system is not necessarily positive .",
    "we are interested in finding an interval - observer of the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 . above",
    ", the observer with the superscript `` @xmath55 '' is meant to estimate an upper - bound on the state value whereas the observer with the superscript `` - '' is meant to estimate a lower - bound ; i.e. we would like to have @xmath56 for all @xmath57 provided that @xmath58 . the signals @xmath59 are the lower- and the upper - bound on the disturbance @xmath60 , i.e. @xmath61 for all @xmath57 .",
    "we then accordingly define the errors @xmath62 and @xmath63 that are described by the models @xmath64 where @xmath54 and where @xmath65 , @xmath66 are the input errors .",

    "it is important to stress here that the choice of a common observer gain @xmath70 in seems to be restrictive at first sight .",
    "this is quite surprisingly not the case as it will be shown later that the same optimal gain will simultaneously minimize the @xmath1-gain of both the transfers @xmath71 and @xmath72 , even when @xmath73 . in this regard , the values of the matrices @xmath74 and @xmath75",
    "do not matter at all when designing the optimal gain @xmath70 .",
    "this will be discussed in more details in section [ sec : optl1obs ] .    with all these elements in mind",
    ", we can state the considered observation problem :    [ problem ] find an interval observer of the form such that    1 .",
    "the linear systems in are positive , i.e. @xmath76 is metzler and @xmath77 is nonnegative ; 2 .",
    "the linear systems in are asymptotically stable ; i.e. @xmath76 is hurwitz stable ; 3 .",
    "the @xmath1-gains of the transfers @xmath78 , @xmath54 , are minimal .",
    "more complex observer structures can also be considered in order to reduce the conservatism of the approach .",
    "for instance , high - order observers such as the ones proposed in @xcite may be considered .",
    "alternatively , a relaxed version of the proposed one which takes the form @xmath79\\tilde{x}^{+}(t)+ly(t)\\\\ & & + [ e - lf]^{+}w^{+}(t)-[e - lf]^{-}w^{-}(t),\\\\ \\dot{\\tilde{x}}^{-}(t)&=&[a - lc]\\tilde{x}^{-}(t)+ly(t)\\\\ & & + [ e - lf]^{+}w^{-}(t)-[e - lf]^{-}w^{+}(t )    \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath80^{+}=\\max\\{0,e - lf\\}$ ] and @xmath80^{-}=[e - lf]^{+}-[e - lf]$ ] can also be considered .",
    "the advantage of the above one lies in the fact that the nonnegativity of the matrix @xmath81 is not required anymore .",
    "however , when an interval observer of the form exists , it may be preferable to use it since it captures more information about the system .",
    "this will be illustrated in the examples treated in section [ sec : ex ] .    as it may be sometimes difficult to find a matrix @xmath70 that makes the matrix @xmath82 both metzler and hurwitz stable ,",
    "the determination of a nonsingular matrix @xmath83 and a matrix @xmath70 such that the matrix @xmath84 is metzler and hurwitz stable is often considered .",
    "suitable pairs @xmath85 can be computed using various methods ; see e.g. @xcite .      for",
    "the sake of generality , let us consider now the following slightly more general system : @xmath86 where @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the matrices are defined such that their dimension corresponds to those of the signals .",
    "the only assumption is that both @xmath91 and @xmath92 are nonnegative and that @xmath93 is nonzero .",
    "we now address the question stated in problem [ problem ] where the matrix @xmath92 is now considered and @xmath94 are replaced by @xmath95 .",
    "formally speaking , we are interested in solving the problem @xmath96 where @xmath97 and in computing the matrix @xmath98 that achieves this infimum . to this aim ,",
    "let us define @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the main rationale for the notation @xmath101 stems from the property of uniformity of the optimal @xmath1-to-@xmath1 interval observers stated in the result below :    [ lem : siso ] assume that the system is miso ; i.e. @xmath102 .",
    "then , the membership relation @xmath103 holds for all @xmath104 where @xmath105    the proof uses the same arguments as for proving lemma 4 in @xcite and is omitted for brevity .",
    "the above result says that , for a miso system of the form , there exists a value for @xmath70 that simultaneously minimizes the @xmath1-gain of the system @xmath106 for all matrices @xmath107 .",
    "this value can be , moreover , calculated by considering the system @xmath108 and theorem [ th : linf ] .",
    "the issue here is that this result only holds for miso systems but can be generalized using the fact that the @xmath1-gain of @xmath109 can be expressed as @xmath110 , where @xmath111 maps @xmath112 to @xmath113 .",
    "however , theorem [ th : linf ] can not be simply considered for all the @xmath111 s independently as each subsystem @xmath111 would require its own lyapunov function ; i.e. the use of different @xmath114 s .",
    "a simple solution is to enforce the @xmath114 s to be all the same , which is equivalent to searching for a common lyapunov function for all the subsystems and is known to be a conservative procedure in general .",
    "this is luckily not the case here as proved in the next two results :    [ th : rankone ] let @xmath115 be a metzler and hurwitz stable matrix and let @xmath116 , @xmath117 , be nonnegative vectors .",
