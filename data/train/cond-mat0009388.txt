    "the numerous recent studies of quantum fluctuations in spin glasses @xcite , have focused either on infinite - range models of ising and rotor models @xcite or models in low dimensions which flow to strong disorder fixed points @xcite . here",
    "we shall continue the study of infinite range models , but will consider a model of heisenberg spins : in this case , the path integral for each spin has a important berry phase term which imposes the spin commutation relations .",
    "as we will see , this leads to a great deal of new physics@xcite and non - trivial dynamic spin correlations even in the spin glass state .",
    "more specifically , we present a complete solution of the quantum heisenberg spin glass on a fully connected lattice of @xmath10 sites with strong gaussian disorder , both in the paramagnetic and the glassy phase , when the spin symmetry group is extended from @xmath11 to @xmath0 and the large-@xmath3 limit is taken . in the limit of large connectivity , ( dynamical )",
    "mean - field techniques apply and the model can be reduced to the study of a self - consistent single - site problem , which is however still highly non - trivial because of quantum effects .",
    "the large-@xmath3 limit is instrumental in allowing for an explicit solution .",
    "nevertheless some of our results regarding the quantum critical regime have been extended beyond the large - n limit . in a recent publication @xcite",
    ", we summarized the main results of the present study . here",
    ", we provide detailed derivations and new results , such as a full discussion of the paramagnetic phases and a discussion beyond large-@xmath3 .",
    "the model considered in this paper is defined by the hamiltonian : @xmath12 where the magnetic exchange couplings @xmath13 are independent , quenched random variables distributed according to a gaussian distribution @xmath14 as already pointed out by bray and moore @xcite , after using the replica trick to average over the disorder @xcite , the mean - field ( infinite dimensional ) limit maps the model onto a _ self - consistent single site model _ with the action ( in imaginary time @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the inverse temperature ) : @xmath17 and the self - consistency condition @xmath18 where @xmath19 denote the replica indices ( the limit @xmath20 has to be taken later ) and @xmath21 is the berry phase of the spin @xcite . due to their time - dependence , the solution of these mean - field equations remains a very difficult problem for @xmath22 , even in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "thus , in ref .  , as well as in most subsequent work @xcite ,",
    "the _ static approximation _ was used , neglecting the @xmath23dependence of @xmath24 .",
    "this approximation may be reasonable in some regimes but prevents a study of the quantum equilibrium dynamics , and is particularly inappropriate in the quantum - critical regime .",
    "however , this imaginary time dynamics has been explicitly studied in a quantum monte carlo simulation _ in the paramagnetic phase _ with spin @xmath25 by grempel and rozenberg @xcite .",
    "recently , we introduced a large-@xmath3 solution of the mean field problem @xcite , in which the problem is exactly solvable and , as explained below , the solution provides a good description of the physics of the @xmath22 mean field model , to the extent the latter is understood .",
    "more specifically , in the following we will consider two different types of spin representations for the @xmath26 spins :    * _ bosonic _ representations : the spin operator @xmath1 is represented using schwinger bosons @xmath27 by @xmath28 , with the constraint @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) . in the language of young tableaux , these representations are described by one line of length @xmath31 .",
    "they are a natural generalisation of an @xmath32 spin of size @xmath1 . * _ fermionic _ representations : the spin operator @xmath1 is represented using abrikosov fermions @xmath9 by @xmath33 , with the constraint @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) . in the language of young tableaux ,",
    "these representations are described by one column of length @xmath36 .",
    "note that for @xmath32 , only @xmath37 and @xmath25 can be represented in this manner .    in the following",
    ", we refer to the model with bosonic ( resp .",
    "fermionic ) representations as the bosonic ( resp .",
    "fermionic ) model . in the fermionic model ,",
    "quantum fluctuations are so strong in large-@xmath3 that the spin glass ordering is destroyed @xcite , contrary to the bosonic model , where a spin glass phase exists , as explained below .",
    "the two models have different theoretical interest : if one wants to concentrate on the quantum critical regime , above the spin glass ordering temperature , one can use the fermionic model ( as e.g. in ref .  ) .",
    "however , since we are interested in the spin glass phase itself , we will now focus on the bosonic model",
    ". nevertheless , our results on the paramagnet will be valid for both cases with only slight modifications explicitly quoted below .    in the @xmath38 limit",
    ", the mean field self - consistent model ( [ actioneffective ] ) reduces to an integral equation for the green s function of the boson @xmath39 where the bar denotes the average over disorder and the brackets the thermal average @xcite :    [ eqbase ] @xmath40    similarly for the fermionic model , we have :    [ eqbasefermions ] @xmath41    in these equations , @xmath42 ( resp .",
    "@xmath7 ) are the bosonic ( resp .",
    "fermionic ) matsubara frequencies and the inversion should be taken with respect to the replica indices @xmath43 .",
    "note that our conventions for the sign of the green functions in this paper slightly differ from those of ref .  .",
    "note that , although the equations are written in term of @xmath44 , the physical quantity is the _ local _ spin susceptibility @xmath45 which is given in the large-@xmath3 limit by @xmath46 in many instances below ( where we mostly focus on the bosonic case ) , we shall drop the index @xmath27 in @xmath47 .    from both analytical and numerical analysis of these integral equations",
    ", we have constructed the phase diagram displayed on figure [ diagrammephase ] , as a function of the size of the spin @xmath1 and the temperature @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath48    let us give here a brief overview of the main features of this phase diagram , which will be studied in great detail in the rest of this paper .",
    "as is evident from fig  [ diagrammephase ] , it is useful to divide the discussion into models with @xmath1 large and @xmath1 small .",
    "both regimes are accessible in the large @xmath3 limit , where @xmath1 is effectively a continuous parameter taking all positive values . for the physical case @xmath22 ,",
    "we will present evidence later that at least @xmath25 is in the small @xmath1 regime for the infinite - range model ; moreover , we can expect that at least some of the consequences of increased quantum fluctuations in a realistic model with finite - range interactions are mimicked by taking small @xmath1 values in the large @xmath3 theory of the infinite - range model .    for large @xmath1",
    ", the ground state must clearly be a spin glass ( fig  [ diagrammephase ] ) .",
    "however , even for very large @xmath1 , it is necessary to consider quantum effects in understanding the low @xmath2 excitations and thermodynamics , and these have not been previously described . in this paper ( sections  [ sec : larges ] and  [ thermo ] ) we will show that the local spin susceptibility has a low energy density of states which increases linearly with energy . at the same time",
    ", the specific heat also has a linear dependence upon temperature .",
    "these results hold for temperatures @xmath49 , although characteristic excitations have an energy of order @xmath50 for @xmath51 ; we will provide scaling functions which determine the dynamic response functions at these energies . at even higher @xmath2",
    ", there is a phase transition to a paramagnet at @xmath52 . for large @xmath1",
    "the static properties of this phase transition are well - described by a purely classical theory in which the @xmath53 in ( [ defsachdevye ] ) are commuting vectors of length @xmath1 .",
    "notice also that we indicate two critical temperatures , @xmath54 and @xmath55 : as we discuss in section [ spinglassphases ] , these are a consequence of peculiarities in the nature of replica symmetry breaking , where the dynamic freezing into the spin glass phase ( @xmath54 ) , happens at a slightly higher temperature than the equilibrium transition ( @xmath55 ) .    for small @xmath1 , we also find a spin glass phase ( fig  [ diagrammephase ] ) at @xmath56 , but the order vanishes at a small @xmath2",
    ". moreover , its excitations and finite @xmath2 properties are very different from those at large @xmath1 .",
    "these are now dominated by signals of a `` spin - liquid '' state discussed in ref .   and described in section  [ subsectspinliquid ] .",
    "in particular , we describe a novel quantum - critical region in the paramagnet where @xmath57 is the characteristic energy scale , and the local dynamic spin susceptibility obeys @xmath58 .",
    "we believe that aspects of this regime may be relevant to disordered transition metal and rare earth compounds in regimes where exchange interactions between the magnetic moments are playing a dominant role .",
    "completion of this picture requires an understanding of the stability of the `` spin - liquid '' picture to mobile charge carriers , and this has also been addressed in a previous work @xcite .",
    "contrary to the classical case , the paramagnetic phase of quantum spin - glass models is non trivial in mean field theory .",
    "an early discussion of these solutions has been given in ref .  , but we present here a much more complete description , and compare our results to the @xmath22 case , when numerical results are available . since in this section we look for paramagnetic solutions , we will consider only _ replica diagonal _ solutions of ( [ eqbase ] ) : @xmath59 .",
    "two types of paramagnetic solutions have been found , that we will now consider successively : the _ spin - liquid _ solutions and the _ local moment _ solutions .        a low - frequency",
    ", long - time analysis of the integral equations ( [ eqbase ] ) reveals that , under the condition that @xmath60 vanishes at low temperature , a solution can be found which displays a power law decay of the green s function at long time @xcite : @xmath61 .",
    "these solutions display a singularity in the complex plane of frequencies , @xmath62 , at @xmath63 , with an amplitude which can be parameterized by an angle @xmath64 as : @xmath65 ( values of @xmath62 on the imaginary frequency axis at the matsubara frequencies will be denoted by @xmath66 , while on the real axis will be denoted , @xmath7 . ) thus , these solutions display a slow local spin dynamics : @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "moreover , the _ local _ susceptibility @xmath69 diverges as @xmath70 at low temperature .",
    "more precisely , one can find the thermal scaling function characterizing the @xmath71 limit , as explained in a previous paper @xcite : @xmath72 note that in the paramagnetic phase of _ quantum _ models , the local susceptibility @xmath73 ( which is the response to a _",
    "magnetic field ) differs from the uniform susceptibility @xmath74 ( response to a constant magnetic field ) , contrary to _ classical _ spin glass models where @xmath75 @xcite : this is a consequence of the commutation relations of the spin , as can be seen for example in the high - temperature expansion in the @xmath32 model . in this large-@xmath3 limit",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath76 for @xmath77 and numerical computations indeed suggest that @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the parameter @xmath64 which characterizes the _ spectral asymmetry _ @xcite of the spectral density at low frequency can be explicitly related to the size @xmath1 of the spin ( which involves a priori an integral of the spectral density over all frequencies ) .",
    "this is very similar to a kind of friedel sum rule applying to this problem , and indeed the derivation follows a very similar route , based on the existence of a luttinger - ward functional .",
    "( interestingly enough , the `` boundary term '' which usually vanishes in such derivations contributes here a finite value ) .",
    "this derivation is presented in detail in appendix [ appspectralasym ] , where the following relation between @xmath64 and @xmath1 is established : @xmath79 this relation has important consequences for the physical properties of the spin - liquid solutions .",
    "first , we note that the spectral density must obey the positivity conditions : @xmath80 and @xmath81 . hence ,",
    "in the fermionic case , @xmath64 must obey @xmath82 .",
    "it is easily checked from ( [ valueoftheta ] ) that @xmath64 precisely describes this range of parameters as @xmath83 is varied from @xmath84 to @xmath85 , and that the @xmath86 relation is unique .",
    "this suggests that the spin - liquid solution is an acceptable low - temperature solutions for the whole range of @xmath83 in the fermionic case .",
    "@xmath87    in contrast , in the bosonic case , the plot in fig.[plotoftheta ] shows that ( [ valueoftheta ] ) actually defines _ two _ values of @xmath64 ( in the allowed range @xmath88 ) for a given spin @xmath1 as long as @xmath89 , while no value of @xmath64 is found for @xmath90 .",
    "this implies that no paramagnetic solution of the spin - liquid type is found _ at zero - temperature _ in the bosonic case as soon as @xmath90 ( note that furthermore @xmath91 is very small ) . for @xmath92 ,",
    "such solutions exist at zero temperature ( even though they are not the true ground - state , see below ) with the locally stable solution corresponding to the smallest of the two values of @xmath64 .",
    "however , even for @xmath90 , _ at low ( @xmath93 ) but finite temperature _ , the spin liquid solutions do exist in the bosonic model . by this , we mean that a numerical computation in imaginary time gives a solution which exhibits the scaling form ( [ formeechelle ] ) , for which a unambiguous value of the spectral asymmetry @xmath64 can be defined and computed numerically . at very low temperature , these solutions are unstable to the spin glass solution , but above the spin glass temperature at low spin , they are relevant in the quantum critical regime associated with the quantum critical point at @xmath37 .",
    "we shall comment in more detail , at the end of the following section , on the nature of the paramagnetic solutions found at low temperature for small values of @xmath1 , in the bosonic case .",
    "another consequence of relation ( [ valueoftheta ] ) is that it allows to predict that these spin - liquid solutions have a _ non - zero extensive entropy _ at zero - temperature and to calculate the value of this entropy analytically .",
    "the derivation of this result follows very closely a similar analysis of the overscreened multichannel kondo problem in the large - n limit , performed in ref .   and",
    "only the main steps will be repeated here .",
    "this can be done either in the bosonic model or in the fermionic one , with slight modifications .",
    "since the spin liquid solutions are relevant at zero temperature only in the fermionic model , we shall present the result in this case .",
    "first , denoting by @xmath94 the value of the entropy per spin at zero temperature , one establishes the following thermodynamic equality : @xmath95 then , a low temperature expansion is used which allows to relate the slope of @xmath96 to the spectral asymmetry parameter @xmath64 above , so that one finally gets ( in the fermionic case ) : @xmath97 the entropy is then obtained by integration over the size of the spin , with the physically obvious boundary conditions @xmath98 .",
    "the resulting value of the entropy as a function of @xmath83 is plotted in fig.[plotentropy ] .",
    "@xmath99    finally , we comment on the physical nature of the spin - liquid paramagnetic solutions found in this section .",
    "these solutions correspond to a partial screening of the local moment at each site , due to the interaction with the other spins . as a result",
    "the local susceptibility diverges logarithmically ( much slower than a curie law ) , but an extensive entropy is still present at @xmath56 , indicating a degenerate state . from a local point of view , the physics is somewhat similar to an overscreened kondo system , but here the gapless bath which quenches the spin is not external but self - consistently generated by the other spins .",
    "we suspect that the physics of this phase has to do with the degeneracy of the ( large-@xmath3 generalization ) of the `` triplet '' state in which two spins are bound whenever a strong ferromagnetic bond @xmath13 is encountered . in section",
    "[ spinliquidn=2 ] , we show that this spin - liquid regime is not a peculiarity of the large-@xmath3 limit but indeed survives in the mean - field description of the quantum critical regime of a @xmath11 quantum heisenberg spin - glass",
    ". it would be very valuable to gain a more direct understanding of this gapless spin - liquid regime from a study of the problem for a fixed configuration of bonds , before averaging over disorder .",
    "this could be achieved numerically and is left for future studies .",
    "this subsection will show how recent renormalization group analysis of related models@xcite imply that the above spin - liquid solution applies to all orders in @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , the large @xmath3 solution with @xmath100 for small @xmath7 acquires no corrections to its functional form : the only changes are to the non - universal proportionality constant",
    ". all the discussion below will be in a paramagnetic phase where it is sufficient to consider only a single replica , and so we will drop replica indices in this subsection .",
    "we begin by rewriting ( [ actioneffective ] ) in the following form@xcite @xmath101 where @xmath102 is a coupling constant and @xmath103 is an annealed gaussian random field with @xmath104 . it is reasonable to expect that the spin correlations in the quantum ensemble defined by ( [ ss1 ] ) decay with the power - law @xmath105 , and we are interested in determining the value of the exponent @xmath106 .",
    "a simple extension@xcite of the solution discussed above implies that in the large @xmath3 limit @xmath107 . here",
    "we will argue that this equality is in fact _",
    "exact for all @xmath3_. now using the self - consistency condition ( [ condcoherence ] ) we obtain @xmath108 , which then implies @xmath100 .",
    "the field - theoretic renormalization group analysis of ( [ ss1 ] ) was discussed in ref .  , and we will highlight the main results .",
    "the key observation is that renormalization of the theory ( [ ss1 ] ) requires only a single wave - function renormalization factor @xmath109 , and that there is no independent renormalization of the coupling constant @xmath102 .",
    "this result was established diagrammatically in ref .  , and we will not reproduce the argument here .",
    "so if we renormalize the spin by @xmath110 , then the coupling constant renormalization is simply @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is a renormalization scale .",
    "the renormalization constant is in general a complicated function of @xmath113 , and was determined to two - loop order in ref .  :",
    "@xmath114 in a minimal subtraction scheme .",
    "however , even though @xmath109 is not known exactly , the exponent @xmath106 can be determined exactly .",
    "standard field - theoretical technology shows that the above renormalizations imply the @xmath16-function @xmath115 furthermore , the exponent @xmath106 is given by the value of @xmath116 at the fixed point @xmath117 where @xmath118 vanishes . comparing ( [ ss3 ] ) and ( [ ss4 ] ) we see that @xmath119 clearly , a zero of the @xmath16 function must have @xmath120 , and this establishes the required result .",
    "we note that similar examples of a critical exponent being valid to all orders ( in spite of a non - trivial @xmath16-function ) can be found for other models in the statistical mechanics of disordered systems ( see e.g @xcite ) .      in a mean field model ,",
    "one usually expects to find locally stable ( while possibly unstable to ordering ) paramagnetic solutions of the mean - field equations down to zero temperature .",
    "hence , the absence of solutions of the spin - liquid type for @xmath90 suggests that a different kind of paramagnetic solution should exist for those values of the spin .",
    "indeed , we have found that the integral equations ( [ eqbase ] ) have another class of paramagnetic solutions in the bosonic case .",
    "these solutions actually exist for all values of the spin @xmath1 and down to zero temperature .",
    "hence , they coexist at low @xmath1 with the spin - liquid solutions in some range of temperature .",
    "their physical nature is very different from the previous spin - liquid solutions , and as discussed below they are not very physical solutions when considered at low temperature .",
    "they are characterized by a green s function which does not decay at long times and obeys the asymptotic behavior : @xmath121 .",
    "in contrast to the spin - liquid case , @xmath122 diverges for @xmath77 in this regime : @xmath123 finding numerically these solutions of ( [ eqbase ] ) requires some care .",
    "we have used an algorithm in which we solve ( [ eqbase ] ) in imaginary time for @xmath124 , for a fixed value of @xmath125 , and then adjust the number of particles to @xmath1 by a dichotomy on @xmath126 .    @xmath127    the local susceptibility @xmath128 obtained in this manner is displayed on figure [ kinewparafig ] . at high temperature ,",
    "we find @xmath129 as expected since the spin is essentially free . at low temperature",
    ", we find another curie law , with a reduction of the curie constant due to quantum fluctuations : @xmath130 hence , for these solutions , the effect of the interactions with the other spins is not strong enough to result in a qualitatively different screening regime , resulting merely in a reduction of the curie constant .",
    "this is analogous to an _ underscreened _ kondo regime .",
    "these solutions are of a similar type than those found in in a quantum monte - carlo simulation of the @xmath32 model @xcite .",
    "there also , a reduction of the curie constant from @xmath131 to @xmath132 was clearly observed .",
    "thus , contrary to one of the conclusions of ref .",
    ", the large-@xmath3 limit correctly reproduces the paramagnetic local moment solution found for the physical @xmath22 case .",
    "moreover , a numerical solution of the large - n integral equations ( [ eqbase ] ) for real frequencies can also be obtained both at high and low temperature .",
    "the results are presented in figure [ newparaomega ] for both @xmath133 and @xmath134 . at high temperature ,",
    "@xmath135 is centered around @xmath136 and @xmath137 is a simple peak . at low temperature ,",
    "we find in @xmath138 a delta - function peak at zero frequency with weight @xmath139 , which is associated with longitudinal relaxation ( see ref .   for a discussion for @xmath22 ) and two peaks , centered around @xmath140 ( cf eq .",
    "( [ newparalambdalowt ] ) ) with a constant width , which are associated with transverse relaxation .",
    "again , these results are very similar to the conclusions reached in ref .   from a fit of the imaginary - time data for @xmath22 , using a model @xmath141 .",
    "the only difference is that the central peak is not broadened by thermal fluctuations in the large-@xmath3 limit .",
    "@xmath142{localmoment.eps}\\ ] ]    finally , since these solutions describe the formation of a local moment at low temperature , and that the onset of the quenching temperature ( at which the reduction of the curie constant sets in ) turns out to be lower than the temperature where spin - glass ordering occurs ( as shown in the next section ) , we consider these solutions as a mean - field artefact of the spin glass ordering .",
    "static limits of such solutions are actually known to occur in the classical sk model .",
    "we also note that the internal energy of these solutions have an unphysical divergence as @xmath77 .",
    "we close this section by noting that , for small values of the spin @xmath1 , a rather intricate pattern emerges for the stability and coexistence of the two kinds of paramagnetic solutions described above .",
    "we have studied this numerically in some detail but do not report this here , since most of these phenomena occur below the spin - glass ordering temperature anyway .",
    "the important features have been displayed on fig.[diagrammephase ] .",
    "we emphasize again that the spin - liquid solutions are the relevant solutions describing the whole quantum - critical regime .",
    "even though they are unstable at @xmath56 for @xmath90 they remain consistent _ finite temperature _ solutions in a much wider range of values of @xmath1 for @xmath93 . at higher @xmath1 and above the spin - glass ordering temperature",
    ", the paramagnetic phase behaves as a local moment , with a curie constant getting gradually reduced as @xmath2 is lowered .",
    "in this section , we investigate spin - glass ordering in this model . the first observation that we make ( sec.[sg_susc ] )",
    "is that the spin - glass susceptibility ( i.e the response to a spin - glass ordering field ) is actually of order @xmath4 in the large - n limit .",
    "this does not preclude a spin - glass phase , but means that the transition is not associated associated with a linear instability .",
    "indeed , we shall find explicit solutions in the ordered phase in the bosonic case , while the fermionic case does not have a spin - glass phase at @xmath143 ( but does order as soon as @xmath4 corrections are considered ) .      here",
    ", we derive an exact expression for the spin - glass susceptibility , valid for arbitrary @xmath3 in this mean - field model .",
    "the derivation is most conveniently performed using replicas .",
    "we note that in the presence of spin - glass order , the correlation function @xmath144 acquires a non - zero value for @xmath145 , which is however static , i.e independent of @xmath146 ( see e.g ref .  ) .",
    "this crucial point is due to the fact that different replicas are independent of one another before averaging , so that for @xmath145 : @xmath147 in the following , we shall denote by @xmath148 the ( normalized ) off - diagonal correlation function which is an order parameter for the spin - glass phase : @xmath149 we consider the stability of the paramagnetic phase to this type of ordering , and introduce an ordering field @xmath150 conjugate to @xmath148 .",
    "this has two effects :    \\i ) it adds to the effective action ( [ actioneffective ] ) an explicit term : @xmath151 the normalization of @xmath150 has been chosen in such a way that the change in the total free - energy is of order @xmath3 .",
    "\\ii ) it modifies the value of the self - consistent field @xmath152 .",
    "the change of the off - diagonal component , to linear order , is imposed by the self - consistency condition ( [ condcoherence ] ) to be : @xmath153 , with @xmath154 the induced order parameter .",
    "one can then perform an expansion of the off - diagonal correlation function up to linear order in both @xmath150 and @xmath155 .",
    "this yields : @xmath156 in which @xmath157 is the local susceptibility of the paramagnetic phase .",
    "since @xmath153 , this finally yields the susceptibility to spin - glass ordering : @xmath158 this formula has two important consequences .",
    "the susceptibility to spin - glass ordering is of order @xmath4 and any spin - glass instability at @xmath143 must be associated with a non - linear effect of higher order ( i.e come from terms of higher than quadratic order in @xmath148 in the free energy ) .",
    "furthermore , ( [ chisg ] ) shows that for finite @xmath3 , a ( linear ) instability into a spin - glass phase will occur when @xmath159 . hence the fermionic model , for which @xmath157 diverges at low - t , will have a spin - glass instability for arbitrary large but finite @xmath3 .",
    "more precisely , since the low - temperature behavior @xmath160 has been shown above to hold for all n for the paramagnetic solution of the fermionic case , we conclude from ( [ chisg ] ) that the spin - glass transition temperature depends on @xmath3 in that case as : @xmath161 .",
    "we now turn to the explicit construction of solutions of the integral equations ( [ eqbase ] ) with spin - glass ordering , in the bosonic case .",
    "the same reasoning as above shows that the green s function @xmath162 does not depend on @xmath15 for @xmath145 .",
    "thus the most general ansatz for the green s function @xmath163 can be written as : @xmath164 where @xmath165 is a function of the imaginary time , @xmath166 a constant matrix and @xmath167 a constant . by definition",

    "the order parameter @xmath148 widely introduced in the spin glass literature @xcite is given here by @xmath176 , or in the limit @xmath20 : @xmath177 the edwards - anderson parameter is @xmath178 @xcite .",

    "we will study the dynamic spectral functions in the spin - glass phase , as defined by @xmath224 , and show that their associated spectral densities are non - zero as @xmath225 only for the value of @xmath192 in ( [ thetamarginality ] ) .",
    "so marginal stability in replica space appears to be connected to a gapless quantum excitation spectrum .",

    "time - translational symmetry requires that the mean - field solution take the form @xmath393 as in ( [ ansatzparisi ] ) , we choose the following ansatz for @xmath152 : @xmath394 where the off - diagonal terms , @xmath148 , are time - independent and characterized by the parisi function @xmath395 , and @xmath396 .",
    "we have included an additive factor of @xmath397 in the diagonal term for convenience , and without loss of generality : as in the discussion below ( [ ansatzparisi ] ) , we will find that this ensures that at @xmath56 the solution for @xmath398 vanishes as @xmath170 . also , the diagonal components @xmath399 do not appear in the above , and we are therefore free to choose them as @xmath400 . here , and in the remainder of this appendix we are assuming that @xmath126 is sufficiently negative so that the system has a spin glass ground state ; for larger @xmath126 , the ground state is a paramagnet @xcite with @xmath401 whose properties are not addressed here .",
    "we now need to insert ( [ rsy4 ] ) into ( [ rsy2 ] ) and find the saddle - point with respect to variations in the functions @xmath395 and @xmath402 .",

    "fortunately , this problem has been completely solved in the classical spin glass literature @xcite , and we can directly borrow the results : the function @xmath395 increases linearly as a function of @xmath173 for @xmath406 , where it saturates until @xmath407 at the constant value @xmath408 combining ( [ rsy7 ] ) with ( [ rsy5 ] ) , we obtain the simple result @xmath409    next , we consider the variation of @xmath226 in ( [ rsy2 ] ) with respect to @xmath410 .",

    "however , our parameterization in ( [ rsy4 ] ) was chosen judiciously , and has the feature that all these additional terms vanish upon using ( [ rsy8 ] ) ; so , the result ( [ rsy10 ] ) applies _ also _ for @xmath414 .",

    "this is clearly a daunting task , and we will be satisfied in describing the @xmath295 limit to first order in @xmath340 . this is similar in spirit to the large @xmath1 expansion of sections  [ sec : larges ] , [ thermo ] , and we expect that higher - order corrections in @xmath340 will not modify the nature of the low @xmath2 limit .",
    "first , we consider the case @xmath390 . here",
    "a complete analytical solution is possible , and was presented in ref .  .",
    "we have at @xmath390 : @xmath417 we observe that the free energy density behaves as @xmath418 , while the specific heat @xmath391 as @xmath295 .",
    "notice also that positivity of @xmath419 requires an upper bound on @xmath126 , which we have assumed to hold .",
    "before considering explicit corrections in powers of @xmath340 , we make an observation that is valid to all orders in @xmath340 .",
    "the solution for @xmath416 in ( [ rsy12 ] ) , when analytically continued to real frequencies , @xmath7 , has an imaginary part which vanishes linearly in @xmath7 at small @xmath7 .",
    "we now show that this conclusion holds to all orders in @xmath340 ; the constraint ( [ rsy8 ] ) will play a key role in establishing this result .",
    "let us write @xmath420 for small @xmath7 , where @xmath413 and @xmath421 are some real constants . inserting this in ( [ rsy10 ] ) and evaluating it at @xmath56 for small @xmath7",
    ", we note that the last two terms in ( [ rsy10 ] ) have imaginary parts which vanish as @xmath422 and @xmath423 . keeping only the leading @xmath7 dependence of the imaginary part",
    ", we obtain the simple expression @xmath424 from ( [ rsy8 ] ) we see that this condition is satisfied , and so @xmath421 can be non - zero .",
    "now , we consider explicit first - order corrections in @xmath340 : we will see that this leads to terms in the thermodynamics which vanish more slowly as @xmath295 .",
    "we can easily use ( [ rsy8 ] ) and ( [ rsy10 ] ) to determine the corrections to @xmath416 and @xmath181 to linear order in @xmath340 ; however , these are not needed here as the shift in the free energy due to such corrections will only appear at order @xmath425 , because the free energy is at a saddle point . indeed , to obtain the free energy correct to first order in @xmath340 , we need only insert ( [ rsy12 ] ) into ( [ rsy11 ] ) .",
    "it is then quite easy to see that the free energy will have a term of order @xmath426 , and that the coefficient of this term will be non - universal and dependent upon the nature of the high energy cutoff .",
    "the required term comes from the @xmath2 dependence of @xmath427 , which from ( [ rsy12 ] ) is seen to be @xmath428 upon inserting ( [ rsy13 ] ) and ( [ rsy12 ] ) into ( [ rsy11 ] ) we will now obtain numerous terms in which the above @xmath429 term multiplies @xmath2-independent , cutoff - dependent terms coming from the upper bounds in the summations over the @xmath430 . as the relative values of these contributions will depend upon the nature of the cutoff , there is no general reason for them to cancel against each other .",
    "hence we obtain a @xmath429 contribution to @xmath431 and a linear @xmath2 term in the low @xmath2 specific heat .",

    "<S> the spin - glass order is fragile , and a spin - liquid state with @xmath6 dominates the properties over a significant range of @xmath2 and @xmath7 . </S>",

    "<S> the study of intermetallic compounds of the transition metals and rare earths has been a subject at the forefront of condensed matter physics for some time now @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a rich and complex variety of behaviors is observed in low temperature electrical and magnetic measurements , much of which lacks a comprehensive theoretical description . </S>",
    "<S> the complexity arises from the dominant role played by the local magnetic moments on the @xmath8 and @xmath9 orbitals and their interactions with each other and the itinerant charge carriers .    </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to begin our discussion in a phase with well - established magnetic order , in which each magnetic moment is effectively static . </S>",
    "<S> this static moment could be polarized in a regular manner ( as in a commensurate antiferromagnet or an incommensurate spin density wave ) , or point in random directions ( as in a spin glass state ) . in most realistic systems , </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic moment is either quite small , or has averaged to zero by dynamic quantum fluctuations : so it is useful to consider mechanisms which reduce the magnetic moment , and eventually cause it to vanish at a quantum phase transition to some paramagnetic state . </S>",
    "<S> two distinct routes to such a quantum phase transition can be envisaged , and , we believe , the interplay between them is at the heart of the complexity of the problem . in the first route , originally discussed by doniach @xcite , the moment is quenched by kondo screening by the itinerant electrons : theories of such quantum critical points have been proposed@xcite in which the predominant role of the itinerancy is to overdamp the collective magnetic excitations . in the second route , </S>",
    "<S> the exchange interactions between the moments play a more fundamental role : a pair of spins interacting with an antiferromagnetic exchange prefers to form a singlet valence bond , and the proliferation of such singlets can destroy the magnetic order . </S>",
    "<S> analytic theories for such transitions has been made mainly for systems without quenched disorder@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> simple models of crossovers between these two routes have also been presented@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper will present a detailed study of the second route to destruction of magnetic order for the case of a strongly random system with spin glass magnetic order . </S>",
    "<S> there are a number of motivations for focusing on random systems . </S>",
    "<S> first , randomness is inevitably present in all materials , and it is clear that it strongly perturbs the low temperature properties . </S>",
    "<S> spin glass order is present in a number of systems , while others appear to be in the vicinity of such a state . </S>",
    "<S> finally , a technical motivation is in the structure of the mean - field theory we shall present : it builds in important feedback effect between the inter - site magnetic correlations and the single - site spin dynamics , and this is crucial to all the non - trivial spin correlations we shall describe . </S>",
    "<S> such a feedback is absent in previous studies of the magnetic quantum critical point , and it has been argued that this is an important limitation for them@xcite . a different route to incorporating these feedback effects has been taken in some recent studies@xcite ; however , they discuss only the paramagnetic state of their model , and the extent to which magnetically ordered states preempt their results remains to be clarified .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper is organized as follows : in section [ outline ] , we present our spin glass model and give an outline of our results , including the phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> section [ paramagneticphases ] is devoted to the nature of the paramagnetic solutions , and more specifically to the quantum critical regime . </S>",
    "<S> section [ spinglassphases ] is devoted to the spin glass phase and to the various regimes within this phase , as a function of temperature and of the size of the spin . </S>",
