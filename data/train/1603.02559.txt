    "a major breakthrough in the investigations of electron - electron interactions in many - body systems was the landau theory of the fermi liquid @xcite . it explains why a system of strongly interacting particles can be described by a system of non - interacting quasiparticles , which allows for simple theoretical models to describe phenomena in condensed matter system .",
    "however , in dirac systems , fermi liquid theory is not straightforwardly applicable @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that they can be described by a marginal fermi liquid @xcite : since the screening length diverges at the dirac point , electron - electron interactions are in principle expected to play a significant role .",
    "+ one important example of a two - dimensional dirac system is graphene . in general there exist two different predictions on the effect of coulomb - interactions in graphene . assuming a weak coupling perspective , electron - electron interactions are assumed to renormalize the fermi velocity according to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the momentum and @xmath2 is a high - energy cutoff@xcite . at strong coupling one expects the system to be an excitonic insulator @xcite .",
    "different approaches yield different critical interaction strengths ; some suggest that graphene in vacuum might be an insulator while experimental evidence rather points towards it being weakly coupled@xcite .",
    "+ there are only very few experiments which allow to deduce information about electron - electron interactions and it would be desirable to have other experimental probes which one can compare to theory predicitions .",
    "a standard experiment in the determination of electronic properties of conductors is the measurement of quantum oscillations in both transport ( shubnikov - de haas ) and thermodynamic ( de haas - van alphen ) quantities .",
    "generally , the amplitude of the oscillations is described by the lifshitz - kosevich ( lk ) formula@xcite .",
    "as electron - electron interactions enter the oscillation amplitude , one can extract information about it by fitting the lk - formula to the measured amplitude@xcite . in a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in the fermi liquid regime , the amplitude of the lk - formula was shown to _ not _ contain an additional damping factor due to electron - electron interactions which could be associated with an effective temperature , but instead electron - electron interactions only affect the oscillations by renormalizing the cyclotron frequency or fermionic mass . @xcite it has to be pointed out that a similar statement was made for the electron - phonon problem  @xcite .",
    "+ since a dirac systems near the charge neutrality point is not a true fermi liquid @xcite , we ask the question whether the lk - formula for a fermi liquid still holds .",
    "we also ask this question in view of experiments where the fermi liquid lk - formula was used to extract interaction effects from the damping of the amplitude of magnetic oscillations in graphene@xcite , albeit for transport measurements .",
    "dirac systems are characterized by a linear dispersion resulting from the hamiltonian , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the effective low - energy bloch hamiltonian , @xmath5 is the fermi velocity , @xmath6 corresponds to the chemical potential and the pauli matrices @xmath7 and @xmath8 in graphene for instance act in sublattice space while on the surface of a three dimensional topological insulator they would act in spin space .",
    "the orbital effect of an external magnetic field , @xmath9 , is in this formulation accounted for in the standard form of the minimal coupling according to @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the gauge field and @xmath12 is the electron charge . in a magnetic field",
    "the spectrum for a single dirac cone is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the landau level index .",
    "these landau levels are highly degenerate and interestingly the zeroth landau level only lives in one component of the spinor .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the applicability of the standard lk formula upon approaching the dirac point .",
    "there are three aspects to this question which we investigate separately in section [ lkformula ] :    * \\(i ) what is the effect of temperature as the temperature approaches the value of the chemical potential in graphene ? *",
    "\\(ii ) how is this modified in the presence of disorder ? *",
    "\\(iii ) is the effect of inelastic processes also to just modify the effective mass or do we have an additional damping term due to interaction effects associated with another inelastic dingle damping temperature ?",
    "the main results of the paper regarding these questions are :    \\(i ) temperature acts in a similar manner as in standard two - dimensional electron gases .",
    "however , there is an interesting modification upon approaching the dirac point , which is , that temperature modifies the oscillation frequency , meaning the oscillation frequency is not a pure geometrical quantity any more .",
    "temperature also provides a cutoff for the quantum oscillations meaning that as soon as temperature is on the order of the chemical potential the quantum oscillations die altogether .",
    "\\(ii ) the effect of disorder can be described in the same way as in the two - dimensional electron gas , accounted for by a dingle temparature . in dirac systems , however , there also is a damping term due to the coupling of temperature and disorder .",
    "furthermore , disorder in graphene also affects the oscillation frequency , which is not the case in a 2deg .",
    "\\(iii ) unlike in a 2deg , electron - electron interactions in graphene lead to renormalization effects _ and _ inelastic effects .",
    "we performed all our calculations for the specific case of graphene , but the results are also applicable to other dirac systems without any restrictions .",
    "the only specification is a factor of four which is a consequence of the spin and valley degeneracy in graphene .",
    "our starting point is the luttinger - ward functional @xcite which relates the thermodynamic potential @xmath15 of the system to its green function , @xmath16 , @xmath17 the green function for graphene in a magnetic field reads @xmath18 ( we set the boltzmann constant , @xmath19 , as well as planck s constant , @xmath20 ) the trace implies summation over the landau level index @xmath14 , the fermonic matsubara frequencies @xmath21 , and the different degenerate states within one landau level . the self - energy @xmath22 accounts for disorder ( @xmath23 ) or electron - electron interactions @xmath24 .",
    "the terms @xmath25 and @xmath26 are introduced to avoid overcounting of diagrams .",
    "their oscillatory parts cancel each other @xcite such that the magnetic oscillations are fully described by @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath29 .",
    "the factor @xmath30 accounts for the sum over degenerate landau levels , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the size of the system .",
    "we use the poisson summation formula which relates the summation of a function to the function s continuous integral : @xmath33 this approach is advantageous when the landau levels are sufficiently broadened due to e.g. disorder or temperature which we assume throughout this paper . in this case",
    "we obtain a small parameter , @xmath34 ( @xmath35 is the disorder potential ) and @xmath36 , respectively , such that the series can be truncated .",
    "+ the first term describes the @xmath37 state and consequently does not contribute to the oscillations .",

    "we do not attempt to make a realistic modelling of the properties of graphene with disorder but instead stick to the most simple treatment of disorder within the self - consistent born approximation along the lines of ref .",

    "we perform the calculation in k - space and not in the landau - level basis .",
    "this approach is questionable for instance in light of the well - known magnetic catalysis in systems with dirac fermions in a magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "however , we believe that this approach is justified in the limit of sufficient thermal landau level broadening , @xmath70 , since in that limit the effective density of states which enters the computation is closer to the one without a magnetic field than to the singular one with the landau levels . to lowest order in @xmath62 we find @xmath71 this term has no information about inelastic scattering processes which is why we go to two - loop order . there",
    "we find ( note that we discard crossed diagrams here and only concentrate on the large - n diagrams ) @xmath72 within renormalized perturbation theory we can define the renormalization @xmath53-factors we introduced in the ansatz for the self - energy , eq .",
    "( note that we use a non - standard definition ) .",
    "we only include the logarithmically dependent parts since the other parts are irrelevant for the flow equations .",
    "they read @xmath73 while @xmath53 corresponds to the field renormalization , as it renormalizes @xmath74 , @xmath54 renormalizes @xmath75 and can thus be identified with the renormalization factor of the fermi velocity ( cf .",
    "this implies that the green function reads @xmath76 and consequently we can define a renormalized fermi velocity @xmath77 as @xmath78 where @xmath5 is the bare fermi velocity . exploiting @xmath79",
    "we obtain the flow of the renormalized fermi velocity as @xmath80 the flow of @xmath62 itself to lowest order in perturbation theory ( one loop ) is given by @xmath81 .",
    "this means renormalizations of @xmath62 itself do not interfere with this result since they are of higher order in @xmath62 leading to lowest order contributions at @xmath82 .",
    "the flow equation implies a critical @xmath83 , which potentially describes a repulsive critical point separating weak coupling from strong coupling .",
    "however , in a strict large - n limit to all orders in @xmath62 the absence of such a critical point was shown by son in ref .",
    "@xcite , meaning that the critical point most likely is an artefact of the order of approximation .",
    "+ for additional effects of inelastic scattering we have also investigated @xmath84 at finite temperatures . here , we concentrate our discussion on the diagonal part of @xmath84 , called @xmath85 , which enters the amplitude and frequency of the oscillation , see eq . , and was introduced in the ansatz for the self energy .",
    "we have found that @xmath86 + in an expansion of the integral in @xmath87 .",
    "in this section we will give an overview of our main results and compare our findings for graphene to the two - dimensional electron gas .",

    "these differences become pronounced if we approach the dirac point , meaning if temperature becomes comparable to the chemical potential . however , in the fermi liquid regime of graphene , i.e. , at @xmath89 , the formula for a standard 2deg is reproduced , albeit with the difference due to the differing spacing of landau levels and the linear density of states .      in table",
    "[ tab : lkformuladisorder ] we contrast the lk - formula with disorder for graphene and for the 2deg @xcite .",

    "another interesting property is that the dominant damping term @xmath93 is fully accounted for by renormalizations of the fermi velocity or cyclotron frequency .",

    "we reproduce the standard lifshitz - kosevich formula for the two - dimensional electron gas , despite the differences due to a different dispersion , which yields @xmath94 for the cyclotron mass in dirac systems .",

    "we find that electron - electron interactions in dirac systems damp the oscillations in two ways .",
