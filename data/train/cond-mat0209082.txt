[ structure ] ) with space group @xmath6 and @xmath7=6.440   , @xmath8=3.899   , and @xmath9=7.651    @xcite .",

    "it is not clear which polymorph is thermodynamically stable at ambient conditions . in recent years both phases have intensively been studied due to their potential industrial applications @xcite .",
    "@xmath5-pbf@xmath1 shows a high superionic conductivity with a low superionic transition temperature suitable for solid state batteries and sensors",
    "@xcite . the @xmath0-phase is a strong scintillator useful in detector technology @xcite .",
    "the high - pressure behaviour of pbf@xmath1 has been studied recently by various experimental and theoretical techniques .",
    "et al _ @xcite investigated the high - pressure properties of pbf@xmath1 by raman spectroscopy in conjunction with a first principles , full - potential linear muffin - tin orbital total energy method in the pressure range from ambient pressure up to 30  gpa .",
    "the authors detected a phase transition at approximately 0.5  gpa from the cubic @xmath5-pbf@xmath1 to the orthorhombic @xmath0-pbf@xmath1 . at 14.7(5 )  gpa a second phase transition to @xmath13-pbf@xmath1 with a yet unknown structure has been observed .",
    "considering previously investigated high - pressure phases of isotype ionic ax@xmath1 compounds ( e.g. sncl@xmath1 , pbcl@xmath1 , bacl@xmath1 and baf@xmath1 @xcite ) , lorenzana _ et al _ proposed a hexagonal ni@xmath1 in type structure and a monoclinic structure with a doubled @xmath7 axis as possible structures for @xmath13-pbf@xmath1 . their calculations revealed that above 16.4  gpa , pbf@xmath1 in the ni@xmath1 in type structure is more stable than @xmath0-pbf@xmath1 .",
    "however , @xmath13-pbf@xmath1 in a hexagonal symmetry could not explain the observed raman spectra and consequently , the authors proposed the monoclinic structure for the high - pressure @xmath13 polymorph .",
    "high - pressure and high - temperature neutron diffraction experiments have been performed from ambient conditions up to pressures of 1  gpa and temperatures of 966  k to investigate the phase diagram and to determine the nature of the disorder of the fluorine ions at high temperature and its pressure dependence within the @xmath0 and @xmath5 polymorphs of pbf@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the phase stability of pbf@xmath1 under high - pressure has also been studied by _",
    "ab initio _ calculations using the perturbed ion method @xcite .",
    "the calculations have been performed for the @xmath0 and @xmath5 polymorphs as well as for the two proposed @xmath13-pbf@xmath1 structures .",
    "the results of the calculations support the existence of @xmath13-pbf@xmath1 in the hexagonal ni@xmath1 in type structure above 20.2  gpa . experimentally determined high - pressure data are mainly for cubic @xmath5-pbf@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "hence , the goal of the work presented here was to measure the structural changes induced by high - pressures in order to elucidate the compression mechanism of @xmath0-pbf@xmath1 and to extend the limited pressure range of the study of hull and keen @xcite for a precise determination of the equation - of - state . here",
    "we present the results of a high - pressure synchrotron powder diffraction study of @xmath0-pbf@xmath1 up to 6.55  gpa .",

    "it was found that the sample is pure @xmath0-pbf@xmath1 .",
    "high - pressure powder diffraction experiments up to 6.55(8 )  gpa were performed at the wiggler beam - line 5.2r at the elettra synchrotron in trieste , italy .",

    "pressure was applied using a diacell dxr-6 diamond anvil cell mounted on a @xmath17-positioning - stage for the adjustment in the incident beam .",
    "the sample was placed in the hole ( @xmath18 = 150  @xmath14 m ) of an inconel gasket preindented to 100  @xmath14 m . in order to ensure hydrostatic conditions",

    "geometry parameters for the radial integration of the two - dimensional data were determined using fit2d @xcite . for the transformation into standard one - dimensional powder patterns",
    "the software two2one @xcite was used , which allows for counting statistics of multiply measured data points in order to provide proper error estimates of the intensities and hence , a correct weighting scheme in subsequent least - squares refinements @xcite .",
    "the one - dimensional powder patterns were corrected for attenuation by the pressure cell .",
    "lattice parameters were obtained from profile matching and the structure was refined at five different pressures by the rietveld method employing the program fullprof @xcite .",
    "the background was described by a linear interpolation between selected points and the peak profile was modelled using a pseudo - voigt function @xcite .",
    "the structural parameters from boldrini and loopstra @xcite were taken as the initial values for the refinements .",
    "the isotropic displacement parameters ( u@xmath19 ) for lead and the two fluorine atoms were determined from the measurement at ambient pressure and assumed to be constant in the observed pressure range .",
    "the standard deviations of the refined parameters were scaled with the berar - factor @xcite .",
    "the pressure - volume data were fitted by a 3@xmath2-order birch - murnaghan equation - of - state @xcite . since pressure and volume are subject to experimental errors , which have to be weighted correctly in the fit procedure , the conventional least - squares fit is not appropriate .",
    "consequently , the method of orthogonal distance regression ( odr ) was used and the equation - of - state implemented in the program code odrpack @xcite to minimise @xmath20 with weights @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the parameters @xmath23 are adjustable parameters ensuring that the weighted experimental errors @xmath24 are in the same order of magnitude for both variables @xcite . , the difference between the observed and the calculated values for p@xmath25 and v@xmath25 are at least one order of magnitude smaller than the experimental error bars , when the experimental error bars are used as weights in the fit - procedure .",
    "this indicates that the relative precision of the observed data points , which influences the fit , is higher than that represented by the error bars .",
    "taking the differences @xmath26p and @xmath26v between the observations and the equation - of - state as weighted errors in the subsequent fitting cycle did not affect the values of the fitted parameters themselves but their error estimates .",

    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the structural changes in a compound under high - pressure can be described by considering the distortion of the respective coordination polyhedron .",
    "recently , two different approaches have been developed @xcite to quantify the distortion of a polyhedron by comparison of an ideal to the real one .",
    "the regular tricapped trigonal prism with all ligands located on a sphere with radius r@xmath34 .",

    "the regular ttp , shown in fig .",
    "[ coordination ] , is characterised as follows : all nine ligands are located on the surface of a sphere with radius r@xmath34 , and the polyhedra edge lengths are ab = ac=2r@xmath34/@xmath35 and ad=2r@xmath34/3@xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the distortion measure of mackovicky and bali - uni @xcite indicates the volume difference between real and ideal coordination polyhedra .",
    "therefore the ligands of the real and ideal polyhedra have to be located on a common circumsphere with radius r@xmath34 .",
    "however , this measure is not applicable to polyhedra with a large variation in the bond distances as found in @xmath0-pbf@xmath1 .",
    "hence , the distortion measure based on the continuous symmetry measure ( csm ) @xcite was used . in this method a regular tricapped trigonal prism is embedded in the observed one . as an additional free parameter the radius around the three cap atoms r@xmath37 was used to consider non - spherical deformation . in order to find the best conformation ,",
    "an evolution strategy @xcite was used to minimise the euclidean norm ( instead of the standard least - squares method employed by pinsky and avnir @xcite , which requires the computation of the two - dimensional derivative with respect to r@xmath34 and r@xmath37 ) . for various pressures",
    "the results of the embedding are given in table  [ coordination - tab ] . at ambient pressure",
    "the ttp is slightly distorted ( csm=1.378 ) compared to the ideal value ( csm=1 ) .",
    "the nine fluorine ions are not arranged on the surface of a sphere ( r@xmath38=1 ) but on an ellipsoid of revolution ( r@xmath38=1.062 ) .",
    "remarkably , the lead ion is not located in the conjoined centroid of the fluorine ligands .",
    "the variance of the fluorine bond distances increase with pressure , reflecting the difference in the compression of the individual pb - f bonds .",
    "the lead ion shifts towards the ttp - centroid , and the arrangement of the fluorine ligands becomes more spheric with pressure .",
    "however , the minimal distance between the observed and the embedded fluorine ions increases .",
    "compared to ttp the distortion is larger and the spheroidal arrangement of the fluorine ligands extends , both effects can be attributed to increasing angular distortions .",
    "raman spectroscopy measurement above 14.7  gpa in pbf@xmath1 indicate a structural phase transition to a post - cotunnite structure with monoclinic symmetry @xcite as observed in the isotype sncl@xmath1 and pbcl@xmath1 compounds @xcite .",
    "the extrapolation of the csm to higher pressures indicate a increasing distortion of the ttp polyhedron .",
    "however , from the present csm data a saturation of the csm may not be excluded .",
    "such a behaviour would suggest a ridged - unit like behaviour of the ttp as it can be found e.g. for the tetrahedral building units in silicates .",
    "since the structure of the post - cotunnite phase is not known for pbf@xmath1 , a further examination of the high - pressure behaviour seems to be justified .",
