    "the signature of a diffractive event in @xmath0 collisions is a leading proton or antiproton and/or a rapidity gap , defined as a region of pseudorapidity , @xmath2 , devoid of particles ( see fig .",
    "-6.5 in    in run i of the fermilab tevatron @xmath0 collider , the cdf collaboration studied the following diffractive processes :    * soft single - diffraction ( sd ) at @xmath3 546 and 1800 gev  @xcite and soft double - diffraction ( dd ) at @xmath3 630 and 1800 gev  @xcite * @xmath4-boson  @xcite , dijet  @xcite , @xmath5-quark  @xcite and @xmath6  @xcite production at @xmath3 1800 gev using rapidity gaps to identify diffractive events * dijets with a rapidity gap between jets at @xmath3 630  @xcite and 1800 gev  @xcite * dijets with a leading antiproton at @xmath3 630  @xcite and 1800 gev  @xcite * dijet production in double pomeron exchange ( dpe ) with a leading antiproton and a rapidity gap on the proton side  @xcite    in addition to the normal variables used to discribe an interaction , two additional variables are needed to describe a diffractive event : the width of the rapidity gap , @xmath7  , and the 4-momentum squared exchanged accross the gap , @xmath8 . for single diffraction , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is fractional momentum loss of the leading ( anti)proton .    in regge theory , which has traditionally been used to describe diffraction , the rapidity gap is formed as a consequence of the nature of the exchanged pomeron , which has the quantum numbers of the vacuum and therefore no hadrons are radiated in its exchange .",
    "diffractive cross sections based on single pomeron exchange factorize into two terms , one that has the form of a total cross section at the c.m.s .",
    "energy squared of the diffractive subsystem , @xmath11 , defined throught the equation @xmath12 , and a second term , which is a function of the diffractive variables @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the latter is usually referred to as ` pomeron flux ' in single diffraction , or more generally as a  rapidity gap probability \"  @xcite .    in qcd ,",
    "the _ generic _ pomeron is a color - singlet combination of quarks and gluon with vacuum quantum numbers .",
    "in addition to the question of regge factorization , another question of interest for hard diffractive processes ( those incorporating a hard scattering ) is whether they obey qcd factorization .",
    "comparisons among cdf results and between results from cdf and hera show a rather severe breakdown of qcd factorization in diffraction .",
    "below , we present the results obtained from the run i studies and discuss briefly the cdf plans for diffractive physics in run ii .",
    "measurements of @xmath13 and @xmath0 sd cross sections have shown that regge theory correctly predicts the shape of the rapidity gap dependence for @xmath14 , corresponding to a leading proton fractional momentum loss of @xmath15 , but fails to predict the correct energy dependence of the overall normalization , which at @xmath16 gev is found to be suppressed by approximately an order of magnitude relative to predictions based on factorization  @xcite . a new cdf measurement of the double diffraction differential cross section gives similar results ( see fig .  2 ) .",

    ", @xmath43 was determined to be @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a suppression of a factor @xmath45 was found in these ratios relative to pompyt predictions using the standard pomeron flux .",
    "given that the pompyt predictions for dfiffractive processes at hera are approximately correct , the observed large discrepancy between data and pompyt predictions at the tevatron indicates a breakdown of qcd factorization .",
    "the value of @xmath46 is approximately the same as that in soft sd ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , as was predicted in ref .  @xcite .",
    "an independent determination of @xmath43 was performed by comparing the measured @xmath6 diff / all ratio with that of dijet producion in association with a leading antiproton ( discussed in the next section ) .",
    "this comparison , which was made at the same @xmath47 ( bjorken @xmath48 ) value of the parton in the diffracted ( surviving ) nucleon , yielded @xmath49 at @xmath50 , in agreement with the value obtained from the @xmath4 , dijet and @xmath5-quark rapidity gap measurements .",
    "the double ratio of @xmath6 to @xmath5-quark diff / all ratios is @xmath51 . since both processes are mainly sensitive to the gluon content of the pomeron , cdf examined  @xcite whether the difference in the two ratios could be attributed to the different average @xmath47 values of the two measurements .",
    "given the dependence @xmath52 of the measured diffractive structure function  @xcite ( see next section ) , the @xmath6 to @xmath5-quark double ratio is expected to be equal to @xmath53 . since in these measurements only central @xmath6 or @xmath5-quark production was considered , the ratio @xmath54 is approximately proportional to the ratio of the corresponding average @xmath55 value for each process , which is @xmath56 gev/@xmath57 for the @xmath6 and @xmath58 gev/@xmath57 for the @xmath5-quark ( about three times the average @xmath55 of the @xmath5-decay electron ) . the expected value for the double ratio is then @xmath59 , in agreement with the measured value of @xmath60 .",

    "@xmath74 and @xmath75 , the data are well represented by the factorizable form @xmath76 with @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively , where the errors are mainly due to the systematic uncertainty associated with the measurement of @xmath48-bjorken of the struck parton of the antiproton .",
    "the observed @xmath10 dependence is much steeper than that of the inclusive sd data sample , which in this @xmath10 region is approximately flat  @xcite . in regge theory ,",
    "the flat shape of the inclusive @xmath79 distribution in this region results from the superposition of a pomeron exchange contribution , which has a @xmath80 dependence , and a reggeon exchange contribution , which enters with an effective pion trajectory  @xcite and is @xmath81 .",
    "the measured value of @xmath78 indicates that dijet production is dominated by pomeron exchange .",
    "such behaviour is expected in models in which the structure of the pomeron is effectively built from the nd parton densities by two exchanges , one at the high @xmath82 scale of the hard scattering and the other at the hadron mass scale of order @xmath83  @xcite .",
    "diffractive dijet production was also studied at @xmath19=630 gev  @xcite .",

    "energies were compared to test factorization . in the kinematical region of @xmath85 gev , @xmath86 gev , @xmath75 and @xmath87 gev@xmath88 , the 630 to 1800 gev ratio of the structure functions was found to be @xmath89 within the quoted uncertainties , this ratio is compatible with phenomenological predictions based on the pomeron flux renormalization  @xcite and gap survival models  @xcite .",
    "factorization was also tested by comparing the ratio of dpe to sd dijet production rates to that of sd to nd .",
    "figure  4 illustrates the event topologies in pseudorapidity space and the corresponding pomeron exchange diagrans for the two diffractive processes .",
    "the comparison of the cross section ratios tests whether the normalization of the diffractive structure function of one of the nucleons is affected by the presence of a rapidity gap associated with the other nucleon .",

    "1em the dpe events were extracted from the leading antiproton data by requiring a forward rapidity gap on the proton side using the gap definition given in section 3 . at @xmath90 and @xmath91 , the double ratio of sd / nd to dpe / sd rates , normalized per unit @xmath10 ,",

    "the cdf run i diffractive studies revealed the following features regarding the process dependence of rapidity gap formation : + ( 1 ) in soft single and double diffraction , regge factorization is violated in such a way as to lead to a scaling behaviour expressed as @xmath30-independence of the @xmath97 distribution of the differential cross sections .",
