    "<S> we report the first experimental observation of the spin seebeck effect in magnetite thin films . </S>",
    "<S> the signal observed at temperatures above the verwey transition is a contribution from both the anomalous nernst ( ane ) and spin seebeck effects ( sse ) . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution from the ane of the fe@xmath0o@xmath1 layer to the sse is found to be negligible due to the resistivity difference between fe@xmath0o@xmath1 and pt layers . below the verwey transition </S>",
    "<S> the sse is free from the ane of the ferromagnetic layer and it is also found to dominate over the ane due to magnetic proximity effect on the pt layer . </S>",
    "<S> +    thermoelectric effects result from the combination between charge and heat current in suitable materials having applications as electric cooling systems or thermal power generators . despite decades of research into themoelectric materials and properties , </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency of thermoelectric devices has remained low due to the interdependence of the seebeck voltage , @xmath2 , the resistivity , @xmath3 , and the thermal conductivity , @xmath4.@xcite one promising approach to overcome this problem and increase the versatility of thermoelectric devices involves exploiting the spin of the electron , in addition to its charge and heat transport properties . </S>",
    "<S> this is the main interest of spin caloritronics.@xcite since the discovery of the spin seebeck effect ( sse)@xcite this field has been the focus of intensive theoretical and experimental research , with the recent detection among others of the spin - dependent seebeck@xcite and peltier effects.@xcite the sse consists in the generation of a spin voltage in a ferromagnet as a result of an applied thermal gradient in magnetic materials , this spin voltage can be detected with an adjacent paramagnetic metal by means of the inverse spin hall effect ( ishe).@xcite since its discovery in permalloy,@xcite the sse has been measured in spin polarized metals,@xcite semiconductors,@xcite and insulators.@xcite in contrast to conventional thermoelectrics this effect offers the possibility of a new approach for all - solid state energy conversion devices , since it involves properties of at least two different materials that can be optimized independently . </S>",
    "<S> one example is the recent enhancement of the spin seebeck effect by implementation of a spin hall thermopile structure.@xcite + the sse is explained in terms of a spin current injected from the ferromagnet ( fm ) into the paramagnetic metal ( pm ) , which is scattered by the ishe , generating an electric field @xmath5 given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath3 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the spin - hall angle of pm , electric resistivity of pm , contact area between fm and pm , electron charge , spin current across the fm / pm interface and the spin polarization of fm respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the spin current @xmath10 is generated as the result of a thermal non - equilibrium between magnons in fm and a conduction - electron spin accumulation in pm , which interact through the s - d exchange coupling @xmath12 at the fm / pm interface . using the linear - response approach , the spin current injected into pm </S>",
    "<S> is calculated to be@xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the effective magnon temperature in fm and the effective conduction - electron temperature in pm , and @xmath16 with @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 being respectively the size of the localized spin in fm , the paramagnetic susceptibility and spin flip relaxation time in pm . </S>",
    "<S> a similar interpretation has been developed using the scattering approach.@xcite + in this letter we report the first experimental observation of the spin seebeck effect in magnetite . </S>",
    "<S> magnetite is a ferrimagnetic oxide with a predicted half metallic character and a high curie temperature ( 858 k ) , these properties have inspired investigations for possible spintronic applications,@xcite therefore films and heterostructures of this material have been grown by several techniques.@xcite besides , magnetite possesses a metal - insulator transition at around 121 k , known as the verwey transition.@xcite + a fe@xmath0o@xmath1 ( 001 ) film ( fm ) of thickness @xmath20 = 50 nm was deposited on a srtio@xmath0 ( 001 ) substrate of thickness @xmath21 = 0.5 mm , by pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) using a krf excimer laser with 248 nm wavelength , 10 hz repetition rate , and 3x10@xmath22 w/@xmath23 irradiance in an ultrahigh - vacuum chamber . </S>",
    "<S> the film thickness was measured by x - ray reflectivity ( xrr ) . </S>",
    "<S> the verwey transition temperature of the film was measured with squid and four probe resistivity measurements and has a value of @xmath24=115 k and the room temperature resistivity is 5 m@xmath25 cm . </S>",
    "<S> further details on the growth and characterization can be found elsewhere.@xcite + the sse was measured using the so called longitudinal configuration@xcite ( see fig.[fig1](a ) ) , a temperature gradient ( @xmath26 ) is applied in the @xmath27 direction , generating a temperature difference ( @xmath28 ) between the bottom and the top of the sample , with temperatures @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively . the voltage ( @xmath31 ) is measured along the @xmath32 direction , while a sweeping magnetic field is applied at an angle @xmath33 with respect to the @xmath34 direction . </S>",
    "<S> this configuration is normally used for insulating samples , for measurements performed on electrically conductive samples with this geometry , the anomalous nernst effect ( ane)@xcite is also measured along with the sse . in order to separate the contribution of the ane , simultaneous measurements of both effects were performed on the same fe@xmath0o@xmath1 film , to do this , two equal pieces with a length of @xmath35=8 mm and a width of @xmath36=4 mm were cut and a pt layer ( pm ) of thickness @xmath37 = 5 nm was deposited on one of them , both samples were loaded at the same time and kept under the same experimental conditions . + figure [ fig1](b ) shows the results obtained at 300 k on the magnetic field dependence of the transversal voltage ( @xmath31 ) , measured on samples with and without the pt layer . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to observe a strong enhancement of the signal upon placement of the spin detection layer ( 5 nm pt ) , which is increased by @xmath38 4 times with respect to that observed with no pt layer . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the resistivity at room temperature of the magnetite layer is 5 m@xmath25 cm which is about 2 orders of magnitude larger than the resistivity of the pt layer , suggests that if there was no thermally induced spin pumping from the fm to the pm , the anomalous nernst voltage on the fe@xmath0o@xmath1 layer would be strongly suppressed by the pt top layer . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the voltage signal in the pt / fe@xmath0o@xmath1 sample must be dominated by the sse . to estimate the suppression of the ane signal upon placement of the pt layer </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the expression from the electron transport theory @xmath39 , where @xmath40 stands for the electron current , @xmath41 is the electric field and @xmath42 is the applied thermal gradient , the coefficients @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the elements of the conductivity and thermopower tensor respectively . under our experimental conditions </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the following expressions : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 describe the fm ( in the experiment , fe@xmath0o@xmath1 ) and pm ( in the experiment , pt ) respectively . considering the open circuit condition : @xmath48 and @xmath49 , with @xmath50 and @xmath51 being the area of the film with normal to the @xmath52 and @xmath32 direction respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the following expresssion for the transversal component @xmath53 is obtained : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56(\\nabla_z t)_{fe_3o_4}$ ] is the anomalous nernst signal measured in the fe@xmath0o@xmath1 film . </S>",
    "<S> considering a resistivity value of 4.8x10@xmath57 @xmath25 m for a pt film grown under similar conditions@xcite and 5x10@xmath58 @xmath25 m for the 50 nm fe@xmath0o@xmath1 film , we obtain that the ane signal in the pt / fe@xmath0o@xmath1 sample is reduced to 10 % of the ane signal in the fe@xmath0o@xmath1 sample , giving a contribution of about 3% to the total observed signal @xmath59 in pt / fe@xmath0o@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a strong indication that the spin seebeck effect is the dominant contribution to the observed voltage </S>",
    "<S> . measurements at different magnitudes of the thermal gradient with the magnetic field applied in the @xmath34 direction , were also performed , figure [ fig1](c ) shows the linear dependence of @xmath60 with @xmath61 , as it is expected . from the slope of this curves we can extract the coefficients for the sse and ane , for the pt / fe@xmath0o@xmath1 and fe@xmath0o@xmath1 sample , respectively . in order to evaluate the magnitude of the spin seebeck effect we define the coefficient @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the length of the sample in the direction of the applied temperature gradient ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> this coefficient is independent of the sample size and enables quantitative comparison between experiments with different geometries.@xcite considering the correction for the shorting effect of the ane in fe@xmath0o@xmath1 due to the pt layer , described above , we obtain a value of the sse at room temperature of @xmath64 = 74 @xmath65 1 nv / k . </S>",
    "<S> measurements on the dependence of the direction of the applied magnetic field were also performed ( see fig . [ fig1](d ) ) , it can be observed that when the field is parallel to the direction in which the voltage is measured @xmath66 , the voltage vanishes , in agreement with eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : eishe ] ) . + the longitudinal sse configuration is normally used for insulating samples , </S>",
    "<S> therefore it is interesting to measure the effect at temperatures below the verwey transition ( @xmath24 = 115 k ) , after the sample undergoes the metal to insulator transition . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig2 ] shows that the ane in fe@xmath0o@xmath1 could not be detected below @xmath30=110 k , due to the very high electrical resistance as a consequence of the strong reduction of charge carriers in the insulating phase . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of the ane above the transition temperature resembles that of the thermal conductivity of the substrate,@xcite this will be the subject of subsequent studies . here </S>",
    "<S> we will focus on the observation of the sse below the verwey transition . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to point out that despite the suppression of the ane , the sse can still be detected for @xmath67 , as it is shown in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig3:sse](a ) for @xmath30=105 k. this is a strong indication of the observation of pure spin seebeck effect . </S>",
    "<S> we estimated a sse coefficient ( @xmath64 ) at this temperature of about 52 @xmath65 12 nv / k . </S>",
    "<S> it can be observed that there is a reduction of the sse compared to the value observed at 300 k , this could be possibly related to the changes induced by the verwey transition on the thermal@xcite and magnetic@xcite properties of the film , which can affect the thermal spin pumping at the fe@xmath0o@xmath1/pt interface and therefore the observed sse signal . </S>",
    "<S> + we proceed to estimate the contribution of the ane due to magnetic proximity@xcite in the pt layer . in order to do so </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the pt layer to be divided into a magnetic and a non - magnetic region with thicknesses @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3:sse](b ) ) . from the electron transport equations </S>",
    "<S> @xmath70 , we obtain a similar expression to that observed in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : transport ] ) , with @xmath71 and @xmath72 correspondent to the magnetic and non - magnetic regions of the pt layer respectively . considering the open circuit condition </S>",
    "<S> as described previously , we obtain the following expression for the transversal electric field : @xmath73 where the parameter @xmath74 accounts for the shorting of the ane of the magnetized region by the non - magnetized region within the pt layer and @xmath75 is the ane of the magnetized pt region . to estimate this quantity </S>",
    "<S> , we use the coefficients for the conductivity and thermopower tensor previously measured in fept thin films@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an estimation of the thermal gradient across the pt thin film can be obtained by considering that the heat is conserved across the different interfaces of our system . for @xmath76 and using the tabulated values for thermal conductivity of srtio@xmath0 and pt,@xcite we obtained : @xmath77 in k / m , with @xmath61 being the temperature difference generated between the hot and cold side of our sample . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained an expression for the upper limit of the contribution due to magnetic proximity in the pt layer to the observed effect : @xmath78\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the number of monolayers of pt which are fully magnetized . </S>",
    "<S> if we consider one monolayer of pt to be fully magnetized ( @xmath79=1),@xcite we obtain a contribution due to the proximity effect of 7.5 nv / k . </S>",
    "<S> this value is almost one order of magnitude smaller than the effect observed at 105 k and comparable to the error of the measurement , therefore the thermally induced voltage is clearly dominated by the sse . </S>",
    "<S> + in conclusion we have observed for the first time the spin seebeck effect in magnetite film . </S>",
    "<S> at room temperature , despite of the fact that the films are electrically conductive , the contribution of the ane effect of magnetite only accounts for 3% of the observed signal , due to the resistivity difference between fe@xmath0o@xmath1 and pt films . </S>",
    "<S> the ane signal falls below the detection values below the verwey transition , this points to a suppression of the ane as a consequence of the reduction of charge carriers . </S>",
    "<S> therefore at temperatures below t@xmath80 the sse signal is free from any contamination from ane of the ferromagnetic layer . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the magnetic proximity in pt has also been evaluated below the metal - insulator transition and it has been observed to be one order of magnitude smaller than the measured signal , clearly showing that the sse is the dominant contribution in our measurements . </S>"
