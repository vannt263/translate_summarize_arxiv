    "the nearby neutron star rx  j1856.5@xmath03754  ( hereafter j1856 ) is the closest and brightest of the seven radio - quiet , isolated neutron stars ( ins ) discovered by _ rosat _ ( for reviews , see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the inss have attracted much attention , in part because of the hope that the equation of state in their ultradense interiors could be constrained using their thermal emission .",
    "progress has been slow , however , as adequate fits of the spectra appear to require somewhat contrived models , with the most successful one appealing to hydrogen layers of finely tuned thickness superposed on a condensed surface ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a major hindrance is our ignorance of the surface magnetic field : without an observational constraint , models can consider too wide a range to be useful .    we have been able to make some progress , using x - ray observations to determine coherent timing solutions and hence estimates of the dipolar magnetic fields for two of the ins ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , b ) .",
    "however , j1856 has resisted such attempts , as its pulsations were so weak that they were discovered only recently , in a long _ xmm _  observation ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) . were unable to determine the spin - down rate of the source , finding only a limit of @xmath8 ( at 90% confidence ) . here , from a detailed analysis of a larger amount of data , we infer a stronger constraint , and derive a most likely phase - connected solution .",

    "we retrieved all observations of j1856 taken with the _ xmm - newton _",
    "( _ xmm _ ) and _ chandra _ x - ray observatories ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) , and reprocessed the data from _ xmm _ s european photon imaging cameras with pn and mos detectors using the epchain and emchain pipelines in sas version 7.1 , and those from _ chandra _ s high resolution cameras following standard threads in ciao version 4.0 . for the _ xmm _  data from 2007 mar 14 , the pipelines gave warnings about odd time jumps in both mos and pn .",
    "we traced these to small sets of duplicated events in the observation data files ( odf ) , which we removed ( our results do not depend on this , or on whether or not we include this observation ) .    given that the pulsations are so weak , we tried to optimize the number of source counts . for the pn imaging observations , we decreased the default 150ev low - energy cutoff to 100ev , which leads to a 50% increase in source events .",
    "for both mos and pn , we selected source events from a circular region of @xmath10 radius and with energies below 1kev ( where background flares are negligible ) . following normal practice , we included only one and two - pixel events ( patterns 0 to 4 ) with no warning flags for pn , and single to triple events ( patterns 0 to 12 ) with the default flag mask for mos ( removing @xmath11% of the source counts ) .",
    "there are also two _ xmm _  timing observations . for the one with mos1",
    ", we used default settings , and selected single to triple events from columns 315 to 329 with energies less than 1kev and the default flag mask .",
    "the timing observation with pn suffers from frequent bursts of low - energy noise events , and from some high - energy ones due to flares .",
    "we identified the former using epreject , after which the source dominates the background down to 215ev for single - pixel events and down to 430ev for doubles , and up to 600ev during flares and up to 800ev otherwise .",
    "we selected source events using these criteria from columns 29 to  45 .",
    "for the _ chandra _  spectra , we extracted not only the zeroth order source events , as done by , but also the about two times more numerous diffracted events . for the former , we used a circle with radius of @xmath12 , while for the latter we took rectangles in transmission grating angles @xmath13 defined by @xmath14 ( the default for extracting spectra ) , and @xmath15 ( corresponding to @xmath16 ) , where the source clearly dominates the background .",
    "most of the _ chandra _  imaging observations were not taken in focus , and we used ellipses to define regions where the source clearly dominated the background .",

    ", we refitted each observation holding the amplitude fixed at @xmath31 .",
    "this yielded the same best - fit values , but uncertainties that were slightly increased for observations for which @xmath25 was high , and decreased for those for which @xmath32 was low .",
    "analytically , this is expected : for small amplitudes , @xmath22 is not covariant with @xmath23 or @xmath33 , and the uncertainties scale with @xmath34 . in table",

    "[ fig : ft ] ) .",
    "since j1856 has been observed so often , we attempted a coherent analysis , using two different methods . first , we tried finding @xmath39 combinations that were consistent with both the frequencies and the arrival times listed in table  [ tab : obs ] . for this purpose , we generalised the method of to allow us to explore many possible cycle counts between observations ( no pair is close enough to give a unique starting solution ) , and to fit not just arrival times , but also frequencies . in more detail , using the long _ chandra _  observation as a reference , we first calculated the number of cycles to the first _ xmm _  observation for the best - fit frequency and for @xmath40 .",
    "next , we estimated an uncertainty on the cycle count using a @xmath41 range , with @xmath1 determined from the measurement uncertainty on  @xmath23 and an assumed _ a priori _ uncertainty of @xmath42 on  @xmath43 . for each possible cycle count , we calculated a new , much more precise estimate of the frequency , and used it to estimate possible cycle counts for the next observation .",
    "we iterated this process , deriving @xmath43 as part of the fit for later iterations , until the fit clearly became bad ( @xmath44 , where including all observations one has 19 dof : 11 arrival times plus 11 frequencies minus three fit parameters ) , or until all observations were included . in the end , the best fits did not depend on which observation was used as an initial reference .",

    "it has @xmath60 for 19 dof .",
    "the fit seems reasonably unique : the two next - best possibilities have @xmath61 and 53 , then eight are found between @xmath62 and  70 , and thirteen between 70 and  80 . also ignoring frequency information ,",
    "the best trial is superior : it has @xmath63 for 8 dof , while the next best has @xmath64 .    as a second method of finding a coherent solution , we calculated @xmath65 for all data , coherently combining fourier spectra for individual observations for a range of frequency derivatives @xcite .",
    "this has the advantage that we do not have to decide _ a priori _ which peaks in the individual power spectra are the correct ones ( relevant especially for the long _ chandra _  observation ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : ft ] ) . for the combined data ,",
    "the highest peak has @xmath66 and occurs at the same @xmath39 found above .",

    "the changes in ordering arise because here we included the short observations , which causes the power in the main peak to increase by @xmath71 , but that in most other peaks to decrease ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ft ] ) . folding the shorter observations on the different solutions",
    "confirms this conclusion .    in order to verify the uniqueness of our solution , we ran 1000 simulations in which we assumed our best solution and created photon time series corresponding to each of the observations ( assuming @xmath72% ) .",
    "we analyzed these in exactly the same way as the real observations . among the simulations , in 983 out of 1000 cases the correct solution was recovered by the trial - and - error method on the long observations , and in all 1000 using the @xmath21 power spectra on all data .",
    "inspection of the mis - identification shows that , as expected , it is the addition of the information from the shorter observations that causes the @xmath21 method to do better .",
    "the best - fit reduced @xmath49 slightly exceeds unity , with @xmath73 ( the second best solution has @xmath74 ) .",
    "this could indicate a fundamental problem , but perhaps more likely reflects that for low - significance detections , outliers in phase and frequency happen more often than expected based on a normal distribution . indeed , among our 1000 simulations",
    ", we find that 211 have best solutions with @xmath75 , somewhat more than the 140 expected for normal distributions . alternatively ,",
    "some unmodeled phase variations may be present , such as seen in other ins ( , b ; @xcite ) .",
    "assuming the star is spinning down by magnetic dipole radiation , one can use the spin - down rate to infer a magnetic field strength , characteristic age , and spin - down luminosity ( see table  [ tab : solution ] ) .",
    "we discuss the ramifications below , assuming the coherent solution is the correct one .",
    "we compare the results with those obtained for rx j0720.4@xmath03125 and rx j1308.6 + 2127 ( j0720 and j1308 hereafter ) .",
    "the inferred value of the magnetic field strength of @xmath76 g is similar to , but somewhat lower than the values of 2.4 and @xmath77 found for j0720 and j1308 .",
    "this lower value might be consistent with the idea that the x - ray absorption features found in the other sources  but not in j1856are due to proton cyclotron lines or transitions in neutral hydrogen , and that in the lower field of j1856 these are shifted out of the observed band .",
    "the inferred value , however , is still somewhat high : calculations by @xcite suggest that for the approximate temperature of j1856 and @xmath78 g ( and for a gravitational redshift @xmath79 ) , strong features due to bound - bound transitions should appear at energies of @xmath80ev ( quantum number @xmath81 ) and @xmath82ev ( @xmath83 ) , but none are observed .",
    "one could appeal to elements other than hydrogen , but these generally have more bound transitions , thus exacerbating the situation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    on the other hand , the inferred magnetic field may be consistent with the idea that the surface is condensed , and that this causes the black - body like spectrum .",
    "this depends on the composition : from the recent work by @xcite , it appears that for relatively light elements ( based on calculations for carbon and helium ) , j1856 is far too hot for condensation to be possible . for iron",
    ", however , the condensation temperature is relatively high : @xmath84ev for a magnetic field of @xmath76 g . while we do not know the exact surface temperature of j1856 because of uncertainties in redshift and color correction , the fits of @xcite",
    "have @xmath85ev .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath86ev at the surface , suggesting that a condensed iron surface is possible .",
    "indeed , this might also be the reason that in early observations , j0720 had a featureless spectrum as well @xcite . for its field of @xmath87 g , iron could condense below @xmath88ev , and its observed temperature @xmath89ev corresponds to a surface temperature of @xmath90ev .",
    "the characteristic age of 4myr we derive for j1856 is much larger than the kinematic age of @xmath91 inferred assuming an origin in the upper scorpius ob association @xcite , and also greatly exceeds simple estimates of the cooling age ( @xmath92myr ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "longer characteristic ages ",
    "although by a factor of three rather than ten  were also found for j0720 and j1308 , which strengthens the suggestion that this is a property common to all isolated neutron stars (;",
    "see for a discussion of possible causes ) .",
    "like for j0720 and j1308 , the implied spin - down luminosity @xmath93 is much smaller than the x - ray luminosity @xmath94 ( for a distance of @xmath95pc ; @xcite ) , consistent with the lack of non - thermal emission .",
    "it is also , however , orders of magnitude lower than the independent estimate of @xmath96 made by assuming that the h@xmath7 nebula associated with j1856 is due to a bow shock , where the pressure from the pulsar wind matches the ram pressure from the interstellar medium @xcite . indeed",
    ", this discrepancy remains even if one considers just the incoherent analysis .",
    "the alternate model for the h@xmath7 nebula considered by @xcite  that it was a moving ionization nebula @xcite  was already rejected by @xcite , because the opening angle of the nebula s tail did not match observations for distances greater than 100pc .",
    "thus , our new measurement leaves the nature of the nebula an enigma .",
    "we thank marc cropper for convincing us some years ago that , in principle , timing solutions could be derived from sparse data such as ours , and matthias ehle and others from the xmm help desk for investigating odf problems .",
    "this work made extensive use of the _ xmm _  and _ chandra _  archives , as well as ads , and was supported by nserc ( mhvk ) and nasa ( dlk , grant # 01207.01-a ) ."
