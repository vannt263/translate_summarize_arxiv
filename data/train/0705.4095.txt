    "anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) are neutron stars with long spin periods and extremely strong surface magnetic fields , the decay of which is largely responsible for their observed x - ray emission according to the magnetar model @xcite . of the dozen identified magnetars ( including soft - gamma repeaters in addition to axps ) , half have also been detected at infrared ( ir ) wavelengths ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review of magnetar properties ) . while the ir fluxes of magnetars have been observed to vary ( e.g. , *",
    "* ) , it is neither clear how these variations relate to changes in observed x - ray flux , nor what is the origin in detail of the ir radiation .",
    "is a transient axp with period 5.54s , first detected @xcite when its x - ray flux increased @xmath7-fold compared to the historical level maintained for at least 24 years @xcite .",
    "four years after the outburst , its x - ray flux has decreased nearly to the quiescent level @xcite .",
    "it was also detected in the ir in 2003 october @xcite , and was observed 5 months later to be 60% fainter @xcite .",
    "is the only magnetar known to emit radio waves @xcite .",
    "this emission is entirely pulsed @xcite , is aligned in phase with the x - ray pulsations @xcite , and is highly polarized , in some respects being similar to that of ordinary young radio pulsars ( camilo et al .  2007b ; see also kramer et al .",
    "however , unlike in ordinary pulsars , the radio emission appears to be transient , the average flux density varies intrinsically by factors of up to @xmath8 on approximately daily timescales , and the pulse profiles vary as well @xcite . by early 2007 ,",
    "the average radio flux density was a factor of @xmath9 lower than when pulsations were first observed 1 yr earlier @xcite . also , unlike the vast majority of ordinary pulsars ,  has a radio spectrum approximately consistent with being flat ( @xmath10 ; @xmath11 ) , over the large frequency range @xmath12ghz @xcite .",
    "the radio window provides a new opportunity for learning about the emission mechanism(s ) of magnetars .",
    "for instance , an extrapolation of the radio spectrum of  exceeds its ir flux , so that the radio and ir emission could have the same origin .",
    "however , the shortest radio wavelength at which a detection had been reported ( 7 mm ) is 3000 times larger than the ir wavelengths , so that coverage at shorter radio wavelengths is desirable , also to provide further constraints on the radio emission .",
    "variability in the ir and comparison with radio variability would also be of great interest , but only two ir observations have been reported , and they predate the discovery of radio pulsations .    with these objectives in mind ,",
    "we report here on observations of at the iram telescope , which has the capability to detect pulsars in the 13 mm range , on simultaneous radio observations , and also on a new ir observation at gemini , along with analysis of archival ir observations from the very large telescope ( vlt ) .",

    "in addition , periodic interference contaminated the h polarization and severely degraded the v polarization , greatly increasing the off - pulse noise levels in the folded profiles .",
    "we believe that these signals , at 50 and 100hz , as well as many harmonics of 1hz , are locally - generated compressor - related interference .    in order to combat these issues , we filtered the data in two ways .",
    "first , to remove the low - frequency noise below @xmath39hz ( due primarily to the changing atmosphere ) , we high - pass - filtered each time series using a 3rd - order bessel filter .",
    "we then fourier transformed the time series and clipped the fourier amplitudes of the strong 1hz harmonics as well as the prominent 50 and 100hz signals . finally , we inverse fourier transformed the data to regenerate mostly interference - free time series , which we then folded .",

    "[ fig : sp ] ) .",
    "the largest pulses had a peak flux density of @xmath49jy , comparable to the strongest celestial sources known at 3 mm with the exception of the sun , jupiter , and venus ( although only for @xmath50ms out of every @xmath51s ) . on july 21",
    "we also detected single pulses at 88ghz .",
    "following these detections , we monitored the pulsar at 88/224ghz on five occasions between 2006 december and 2007 april , using identical observing parameters .",
    "these latter observations were done in winter and early spring , under better weather conditions ( table  [ tab : iram ] ) .",
    "the pulsar was detected on two of these occasions , at 88ghz in the h polarization , in december and april , with @xmath520.3mjy ( see table  [ tab : radio ] ) . in 2007 april , @xmath53mjy .",
    "because the intrinsic flux density and pulse profile of  vary on @xmath50 day timescales , determination of a spectral index ideally requires simultaneous multi - frequency observations .",
    "we therefore observed at parkes , nanay , the green bank telescope ( gbt ) , and the very large array ( vla ) on 2006 july 1920 , nearly simultaneously with iram .",

    "following the recommendations of @xcite , the psf was derived from brighter stars in an iterative fashion , where in each iteration nearby fainter stars are removed with the current best model . for a well - matched model psf , with minimal residuals , we chose a lorentzian analytical base , and linear dependence of the shape on position .",

    "we found that a constant offset gave a good fit , with the rms residual of 0.06mag being only slightly larger than the typical 2mass measurement error of typically @xmath76mag for the 21 stars we used .",

    "the infrared counterpart has faded ( see   [ sec : ir ] for details ) . ]",

    "likely , the large scatter reflects the general difficulty of doing reliable photometry on ao - corrected images .",
    "indeed , the largest scatter is found for the 2004 march vlt and the 2006 gemini data , which had the best ao correction , while the smallest is for the 2003 october vlt data , which had the worst correction .",

    "the values for 2003 october and 2004 march are consistent with those reported by @xcite and @xcite , respectively , but our uncertainties are larger by a factor of 2",
    ". this can not be due solely to the fact that we included the calibration uncertainty , since for the two observations concerned this is smaller than the measurement uncertainty for the faint target . in order to verify our estimates of the uncertainties",
    ", we checked the measurements of three other , relatively faint stars ( at @xmath77 sse , @xmath78 ene , and @xmath79 n of the target ; the former two are visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : ir ] ) .",
    "for the five observations , their magnitudes are [ 20.35(12 ) , 20.39(11 ) , 20.30(12 ) , 20.33(11 ) , 20.39(10 ) ] , [ 20.30(11 ) , 20.33(11 ) , 20.23(11 ) , 20.27(10 ) , 20.40(10 ) ] , and [ 21.5(4 ) , 20.94(14 ) , 21.0(2 ) , 21.0(2 ) , 21.01(11 ) ] , where the uncertainties again include the calibration uncertainties .",
    "the uncertainty estimates are comparable to the scatter between the magnitudes , suggesting that they are reasonable ( if perhaps slightly high ) .",
    "independent of the details of the uncertainties , our measurements show that the ir brightness of  did not vary greatly in 2003 and 2004 , by @xmath80% , declining more sharply only by 2006 .",
    "overall , these ( sparsely sampled ) observations do not show a clear trend .",
    "we also searched for intra - night variations in the 2004 march data , by considering the observation in two separate 18minute segments , finding a magnitude difference of @xmath81 . at the @xmath50hr or @xmath50day timescales ,",
    "we thus have found no evidence for variations at the @xmath82 level .",
    "finally , using the @xmath61-band zero point of @xcite , the gemini measurement in 2006 september corresponds to a flux density of @xmath83jy . if @xmath84 @xcite , then @xmath85 @xcite , so that the de - reddened flux is 1.45 times larger , @xmath86jy .",
    "the remarkable detection of  at frequencies of 88 and 144ghz with iram is a record among pulsars ( see * ? ? ? * for previous highest - frequency detections ) .",
    "this magnetar has now been detected at radio ",
    "millimeter wavelengths spanning a factor of 400 .",
    "the spectrum over this expanse is flat compared to that of most pulsars ( @xmath87 , measured over a narrower frequency range ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it is difficult to make a definitive quantitative statement : ( 1 ) as for ordinary pulsars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , individual phase components of the pulse profile may have differing spectra ; ( 2 ) at high frequencies ( @xmath88ghz ) there is considerable variability in measured flux density due to interstellar scintillation ; ( 3 ) the intrinsic flux varies with time ; ( 4 ) the spectrum also apparently varies with time ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : alpha ] ) ; and ( 5 ) the intrinsic spectrum need not be represented by a single power law .",
    "the only simultaneous multi - frequency detections among those summarized in figure  [ fig : fluxes ] were the ones at the vla ( 1.4 and 4.9ghz ) , and 1.4ghz at nanay along with 88ghz at iram .",
    "the spectral index obtained from the first pair is @xmath89 , while from the second , @xmath90 , in both cases with substantial uncertainties and also suffering from some of the problems noted above .",
    "attempts to infer @xmath4 from other measurements collected within a period of 2.5 days ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxes ] ) , also suffered from such problems .",
    "( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] . ) with the foregoing caveats in mind , we summarize the situation thus : before 2006 august , the pulse - averaged spectrum of  over the range 1.4144ghz could be usefully described by a single spectral index in the range @xmath91 , with some time variability observed . since then , the spectrum has apparently steepened , with @xmath92 .",
    "in retrospect , the flux of the pulsar started changing dramatically around mid 2006 july , near the time of the first iram observations .",
    "this was accompanied by a change in the character of pulse profile variations , as well as large torque variations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the flux density at 1.4ghz by early 2007 was generally quite low ( @xmath93mjy  although fluctuations continue : see the last entry in table  [ tab : radio ] ) .",
    "together with a moderate spectral index of @xmath94 , this can account for the non - detections at @xmath95ghz in 2007 ( table  [ tab : radio ] ) .",
    "the average pulse profiles of  observed during 2006 july 1920 and spanning 1.4144ghz are shown in figure  [ fig : profs ] .",
    "the profiles at 6.619ghz are very similar , while in all 1.4ghz observations on this date the `` precursor '' component is absent ( phase 0.85 in the figure ) .",
    "this is unexpected , because the parkes 1.4ghz observations bracketed in time that at 6.6ghz , ensuring that the differences observed between the pulse profiles were not caused by a global change in the profile .",
    "rather , the absence of the precursor at 1.4ghz may point on this day either to an extremely positive spectral index for that component ( @xmath96 ) , or to absorption of the 1.4ghz radiation along the line of sight at the location in the magnetosphere corresponding to this pulse phase .",
    "the absence of the precursor at 88ghz may be explained by a spectrum over 1988ghz steeper than that of the main component by @xmath97 . in making this estimate we assumed that roughly half of the precursor power would be present in each of the h and v polarizations .",
    "this follows from a computation of the polarimetric stokes parameters as they would appear for the iram observations , under the assumption that the precursor was polarized at millimeter wavelengths as it was earlier at 1.4ghz ( see * ? ? ?",
    "a similar computation for the main profile component using the ( different ) absolute position angle of linear polarization observed at 1.48.4ghz @xcite , shows that the vast majority of its power in the iram observations should be present in the h polarization , as is indeed the case (   [ sec : iram ] ) .",
    "this provides evidence that  remains highly linearly polarized at wavelengths as short as 2 mm . for comparison ,",
    "some ordinary pulsars appear to depolarize significantly with decreasing wavelength , down to the limit of the observations at 1 cm @xcite .",
    "however , separate profile components can evolve differently with wavelength .",
    "@xcite consider a model where orthogonal polarized modes have different spectra , leading naturally to some highly polarized components with flat spectra , down to 10 cm wavelength .",
    "also , several young pulsars remain highly polarized down to the limit of the observations at 3.5 cm @xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible that in this respect  differs from ordinary young pulsars more in having a flat spectrum all the way down to 2 mm , which enables us to make the measurements , than in remaining highly polarized at those wavelengths ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in any case",
    ", these two features may not be independent .    as seen clearly in figure  [ fig : iram ] ,",
    "the flux density of observed at millimeter wavelengths through a bandwidth of 12ghz varies by factors of a few on timescales of @xmath50hr .",
    "most of this variation is likely caused by interstellar scintillation (   [ sec : iram ] ) .",
    "the surprise is not that the received flux varies , but that it varies so relatively little .",
    "qualitatively , the flux modulation for these iram observations is much smaller than that observed at 42ghz and more comparable to that observed at 1419ghz ( cf .",
    "* ) . perhaps for this object",
    ", the transition between strong and weak interstellar scattering ( at which the flux modulation peaks ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is about 50ghz .",
    "detailed analysis of scintillating behavior for will be presented by ransom et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "the single pulses seen from  at 88ghz on 2006 july 19 ( fig .  [ fig : sp ] ) appear qualitatively similar to those observed at 2 and 42ghz about 2 months earlier @xcite .",
    "in particular , they are narrow ( a few ms ) , wander about with no obvious phase coherence from rotation to rotation , and gradually build up the much wider average profile .",
    "also , some particularly strong pulses are emitted from rotational phases at which the average pulse is weak or not detectable , implying significantly different pulse energy distributions at different phases .",
    "a detailed treatment of single - pulse behavior from  will be presented elsewhere .    with the detection of  down to 2 mm wavelength , and shortward of @xmath5 m , there remains a factor of 1000 in wavelength where it is undetected ( wang et al .",
    "2007 report upper limits at 24 , 8 , and @xmath98 m ) .",
    "as discussed earlier , the radio  to  millimeter spectrum is somewhat uncertain , and is variable , but it is flat enough that the radio spectrum extrapolated to ir wavelengths exceeds the ir fluxes ( possibly by a very large amount ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) . therefore , it is possible that the radio spectrum steepens smoothly to join the ir .",
    "contemporaneous detections in several ir bands would be useful to delineate the shape of the spectrum in this region . similarly ,",
    "detection of ir pulsations from  would be of great help in pinning down the emission mechanism , but this has not been attempted due to the faintness of the source .",
    "energy flux ( _ left axis _ ) versus frequency for .",
    "the _ rosat _ and _ xmm _ curves are fits to x - ray measurements obtained in 1992 and 2003 september , respectively , and approximately bracket the observed flux range of the source ( see * ? ? ?",
    ". in the optical / ir range , squares with arrows denote upper limits , obtained at @xmath99 band ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  eso  03  ) and mid - ir wavelengths ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  spitzer  05  ) .",
    "the ir detections ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and   [ sec : ir ] ; _ circles _ ) bracket the range observed ( see table  [ tab : ir ] ) .",
    "all ir  optical  x - ray measurements have been corrected for interstellar absorption . at radio frequencies ,",
    "we have drawn two solid lines between 1 and 144ghz , corresponding to a flat spectrum with a flux density of 10mjy ( _ upper _ ) , and a spectrum with @xmath100 and 1ghz flux density of 1mjy ( _ lower _ ) .",
    "these spectra crudely bracket the range of variability displayed by the pulsar in 2006 ( see text ) . in each case",
    "we also extrapolated the spectra to @xmath101hz ( _ dotted lines _ ) .",
    "very importantly , the only data point in the figure that is more or less contemporaneous with any of the radio detections is the `` gemini  06 '' ir observation ( see   [ sec : ir ] ) , so that interpretation of this figure requires care . on the right axis",
    "we plot the isotropic luminosity for a distance of 3.5kpc ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for comparison ,",
    "the spin - down luminosity of  in early 2007 was approximately @xmath102ergss@xmath103 ( see * ? ? ? * ) . ]",
    "the x - ray spectra in figure  [ fig : sed ] represent blackbody fits to the high and low states observed historically , discussed in more detail by @xcite .",
    "these are corrected for interstellar absorption , which has been fitted as a free parameter to the x - ray spectrum .",
    "the high - state spectrum requires two blackbodies to get a satisfactory fit , while detailed models involving the effects of the stellar atmosphere and resonant cyclotron scattering in the magnetosphere can reproduce the spectrum using one surface temperature and one magnetospheric electron temperature @xcite .",
    "in either case , it is evident that the rayleigh - jeans tail of the thermal x - ray spectrum can not account for the ir flux , which must come from a separate mechanism .",
    "( until recently , it was customary to fit x - ray spectra of axps with a steep power - law plus a blackbody , but this is unphysical because it grossly overpredicts the optical and ir fluxes , and because comptonization of x - ray blackbody photons can only produce high - energy power - law tails , not low - energy ones . )    @xcite noted that the ir and x - ray flux from  had both decreased by a factor of about 2 within a period of 5 months ( see the first two observations in table  [ tab : ir ] ) .",
    "they considered that a fossil disk reprocessing some x - rays might account for this correlation .",
    "however , we have shown that the ir emission from  fluctuated , rather than following a monotonic decreasing trend (   [ sec : ir ] ) . in 2006 september , it was a factor of about 2 fainter than when observed by @xcite 2.5 years before ( table  [ tab : ir ] ) . for comparison ,",
    "the x - ray flux decreased monotonically by a factor of @xmath9 in the same period @xcite .",
    "therefore , the ir and x - ray fluxes are not simply correlated .",
    "four axps , including , have displayed ir variations , although no general trend is evident thus far . in 1e  2259 + 586 , following an x - ray outburst and accompanying ir increase , both decayed similarly and the ir flux reached the quiescent level after @xmath50yr @xcite . in 1e  1048.15937 , large ir variations are not correlated with the spin - down rate , but may be anticorrelated with the x - ray flux @xcite . and in 4u  0142 + 61 , although the ir , optical , and x - ray fluxes ( and spectra ) all vary , including ir variations of over a magnitude on a timescale of days , there are no clear correlations @xcite . in ,",
    "the latest ir flux is also the faintest yet observed , and the presently observed spin - down rate is the smallest on record @xcite .",
    "the previous ir observations , brighter and perhaps showing some variability ( table  [ tab : ir ] ) , all took place within 1.8yr of the original large x - ray outburst @xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible to postulate that the latest ir detection corresponds to some sort of quiescent level , much like the star has approximately reached in x - rays @xcite , while the earlier observations reflected at least in part transient responses from an active magnetar , related to the outburst that led in the first place to the discovery of .",
    "however , the sampling of the ir observations is limited , and no clear conclusion can yet be reached .    likewise , we do not yet know whether the ir and radio fluxes are correlated . the original radio detection , in 2004 january , had a flux density at 1.4ghz of 4.5mjy @xcite ; at the time of the latest ir observation in 2006 september , this was near 1.6mjy ( table  [ tab : radio ] ) ; and between 2006 february and september , the flux density ranged between 13 and 1mjy , with day - to - day fluctuations by factors of up to @xmath104 and a general downward trend @xcite .",
    "at least in 2006 , therefore , the radio flux fluctuated by a greater factor than did the ir between 2003 and 2006 . but given the limited ir and nearly non - existent simultaneous radio  ir sampling , it remains possible that the fluxes in these two bands may be related .",
    "simultaneous ir and radio observations sampling a variety of timescales should settle this question .",
