    "magnetic nanoparticles are of great interest because of their nanoscale physical properties and many current and potential applications .",
    "these applications range from high - density storage media@xcite and spintronic devices@xcite to biomedical applications like drug delivery , cell separation , cancer treatment and many others ( for a review , see refs .  ) .",
    "since the physical properties of nanoparticles play a decisive role in all these applications , their study is of fundamental importance . in particular , for high - density storage media , e.g. , bit - patterned media@xcite where each nanoparticle is a carrier of information ,",
    "the thermal stability of a given direction ( or magnitude ) of the nanoparticle magnetic moment is one of the most important problems .",
    "the reason is that under thermal fluctuations the magnetic moment can be randomly switched to a new state leading to the loss of information .    in the case of ferromagnetic nanoparticles ,",
    "the fluctuation dynamics of the nanoparticle magnetic moment can be described by the stochastic landau - lifshitz equation .",
    "if the noise term in this equation is approximated by the gaussian white noise , then the probability density of the magnetic moment satisfies the fokker - planck equation whose properties are well known.@xcite this approach , introduced by brown@xcite almost five decades ago , has become an important tool in the study of stochastic magnetic dynamics ( see ref .   and references therein ) . to characterize the thermal stability in the case of uniaxial nanoparticles , it is often enough to determine the lifetimes of the nanoparticle magnetic moment in the  up \" and  down \" states . in the above approach ,",
    "the lifetime in a given state is usually interpreted as the relaxation time . however , from a theoretical point of view , the lifetime is reasonable to associate with the mean first - passage time ( mfpt ) , i.e. , average time that a random process dwells in a prescribed state .",
    "an additional advantageous feature of this definition of the lifetime is that the mfpt method is mathematically well developed.@xcite this approach was first applied to study the magnetic relaxation in systems of noninteracting@xcite and dipolar interacting@xcite nanoparticles subjected to a constant magnetic field .",
    "in general , the lifetime depends on both intrinsic properties of nanoparticles and external magnetic fields .",
    "the case when the external fields contain a rotating magnetic field applied perpendicular to the easy axes of nanoparticles has a particular interest . on the one hand , this is because the rotating field plays a key role in the microwave - assisted switching@xcite and , on the other hand , because the corresponding dynamical equations ( without accounting the thermal fluctuations ) can often be solved analytically.@xcite specifically , it has been shown@xcite ( see also ref .  ) that the rotating field can induce two types of the stable precessional modes of the magnetic moment , namely , the periodic ( p ) and quasi - periodic ( q ) modes . under certain conditions,@xcite one mode can exist in the up state of the magnetic moment and the other in the down state .",
    "the thermal fluctuations make the random transitions between these modes possible , and the problem of the lifetime of the p and q modes appears .",
    "some aspects of this problem have already been considered previously in the context of magnetic relaxation and induced magnetization.@xcite but the dependence of the lifetime on the parameters of the rotating field has not been studied systematically . at the same time , the effect of strong dependence of the lifetime on the rotating field frequency , which is expected to exist in the vicinity of the larmor frequency , could be important for applications .",
    "therefore , in this paper we present a detailed analytical and numerical analysis of the above mentioned problem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "the numerical solution of the deterministic landau - lifshitz equation in the long - time limit has shown that , depending on the rotating field amplitude and frequency , in this case the magnetic moment can be in one of two p modes , in the quasi - periodic ( q ) mode , or even be unstable .",
    "these results obtained in the absence of thermal fluctuations have been collected in the diagram shown in fig . 1 .",
    "if the amplitude and frequency of the rotating field are chosen so that a stable precessional mode exists in both up ( @xmath459 ) and down ( @xmath493 ) states of the magnetic moment , then the thermal fluctuations can cause transitions between these modes .",
    "one of the most important parameters characterizing these transitions is the lifetime of a given mode .",
    "since it can be naturally associated with the mean first - passage time for the magnetic moment , we have used the fokker - planck formalism to define this quantity and calculate its properties . in particular",
    ", we have determined the boundary conditions and transformation properties of the lifetime and have developed an analytical method for finding its frequency dependence in the case of high anisotropy barrier and small amplitudes of the rotating field . using this method",
    ", it has been shown that the rotating field ( a ) slightly decreases ( if @xmath250 ) or increases ( if @xmath494 ) the lifetime of the p mode at large frequencies and ( b ) strongly decreases it ( if @xmath250 ) in the vicinity of the larmor frequency .",
    "we have also established that at zero frequency the lifetime is always less than in the limit of large frequencies .",
    "these analytical findings for the lifetime of the p mode have been confirmed by our numerical simulations of the stochastic landau - lifshitz equation .",
    "moreover , the numerical simulations of this equation for not too small amplitudes of the rotating field permitted us to solve the problem of the lifetime of the q mode . since in this case",
    "the precession angle is a periodic function of time which can cross the anisotropy barrier , the solution of this problem is of particular interest .",
    "it has turned out that , although the precessional angle depends on time , the lifetime of the q mode practically does not depend on this time , i.e. , on the precession angle .",
    "we have also verified this result by calculating the lifetime from the first - passage time distributions that correspond to different values of the precession angle .",
    "we are grateful to the institute of applied physics nas of ukraine for granting us access to their computing facilities .",
