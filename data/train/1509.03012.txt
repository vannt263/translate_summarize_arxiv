    "topological insulators are a class of time - reversal symmetric materials that display non - trivial topological order and are characterized by an insulating bulk with protected conducting edge states @xcite .",
    "this type of material was first predicted @xcite and then observed @xcite in @xmath4 in hgte / cdte quantum wells and subsequently in @xmath5 in group v and group v / vi alloys that display strong enough spin orbit coupling to induce band inversion - @xmath6 in the first instance @xcite and then in @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite to name but a few examples . owing to their unusual band structure , these materials display a number of unique electronic properties , the most notable of which is the quantum spin hall effect where quantized surface spin currents are observed even though the usual charge currents are absent @xcite .",
    "in addition to their interesting electronic properties , topological insulators also display a number of unusual electromagnetic properties .",
    "specifically , topological insulators have the ability to mix electric , @xmath0 , and magnetic induction , @xmath1 , fields @xcite , a feature which has a pronounced affect on the optical response of the material @xcite . in particular , this magnetoelectric @xmath10 mixing allows one to realise an axionic material @xcite .",
    "such materials are described by the lagrangian density @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the usual electromagnetic lagrangian density and @xmath13 is a term that couples the electric and magnetic induction fields .",
    "this additional electromagnetic interaction reads @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the fine structure constant and @xmath16 is termed the axion field in particle physics ( although , as far as electromagnetism is concerned , it merely acts as a space and frequency dependent coupling parameter ) . in order to realise such a material in a topological insulator ,",
    "a time symmetry breaking perturbation of sufficient size must be introduced to the surface to induce a gap , thereby converting the material into a full insulator .",
    "such a gap can be opened by introducing ferromagnetic dopants to the surface ( 12% fe doping in @xmath7 leads to a mid - infrared gap of 50mev/25@xmath17 m @xcite ) or by the application of an external static magnetic field @xcite .",
    "in such a time - reversal - symmetry - broken topological insulator ( tsb - ti ) the constitutive relations are altered and , hence , the optical properties of the material change dramatically .    here , we derive the electromagnetic green s function for a layered tsb - ti .",
    "the electromagnetic green s function is the solution to the vector helmholtz equation for a single frequency point source and can be used to generate general field solutions for an arbitrary distribution of sources .",
    "this function has a wide range of applications in both classical @xcite and quantum optics @xcite and is an important component in studies of linear @xcite and non - linear @xcite optics , casimir @xcite and casmir - polder @xcite forces , decoherence @xcite and the dynamics of trapped atoms @xcite and molecules @xcite .",
    "thus , knowledge of the green s function is of value to a great many fields .",
    "as with all electromagnetic studies , we begin with the maxwell equations and constitutive relations for the material in question . for a tsb - ti these are @xcite @xmath18 and @xmath19 where @xmath15 is the fine structure constant and @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath16 are the dielectric permittivity , magnetic permeability and axion coupling respectively , the latter of which takes even multiples of @xmath22 in a conventional magneto - dielectric and odd multiples of @xmath22 in tsb - ti , with the magnitude and sign of the multiple given by the strength and direction of the time symmetry breaking perturbation . the @xmath23 and @xmath24 terms are the noise polarization and magnetization , respectively .",
    "these terms are langevin noise terms that model absorption within the material @xcite .",
    "these relations can be derived from the lagrangian density in eq . @xcite . using the above constitutive relations",
    ", one can show that the frequency components of the electric field obey the inhomogeneous helmholtz equation @xmath25\\\\ = i\\omega\\mu_{0}\\left[\\mathbf{j}_{e}(\\mathbf{r},\\omega ) + \\mathbf{j}_{n}(\\mathbf{r},\\omega)\\right ] , \\label{ehelmholtz}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the source term for electromagnetic waves generated by external currents and @xmath27 is the source term for electromagnetic waves generated by noise fluctuations within the material .",
    "if the axion coupling is homogeneous , @xmath28 , then the last term on the left - hand side vanishes and one finds that the propagation of the electric field is the same as in a conventional magneto - dielectric . as a result , electromagnetic waves propagating within a homogeneous tsb - ti retain there usual properties - dispersion is linear , the phase and group velocities are proportional to the usual refractive index , the fields are transverse and orthogonal polarizations do not mix .",
    "thus , the effects of the axion coupling are only felt when the axion coupling varies in space . for layered ,",
    "homogeneous media this will occur only at the interfaces where the properties of the medium change .",
    "an important set of functions for any layered media are the fresnel coefficients for reflection and transmission at each interface .",
    "these functions are required to construct the green s function .",
    "in fact , the fresnel coefficients for tsb - tis have been studied before @xcite , however , the standard expression for the green s function requires a slightly different form for the coefficients compared to those in previous work @xcite .",
    "furthermore , certain aspects of tsb - tis mean that the usual method of computing this form of the coefficients leads to incorrect results .",
    "for these reasons , it is worth revisiting the derivation in some detail .    in the derivation of the fresnel coefficients for",
    "a conventional magneto - dielectric one usually defines two polarizations ; the @xmath2 polarization , where the electric field , @xmath0 , is parallel to the interface , and the @xmath3 polarization , where the magnetic field , @xmath29 , is parallel to the interface . since , from eq .",
    ", the electric field propagation is unaffected by a homogeneous axion coupling one can see that the @xmath2 polarization is unchanged . however , from eq .",
    ", one can see that the magnetic field , @xmath29 , is no longer perpendicular to the electric field , @xmath0 . thus defining the @xmath3 polarization in terms of the magnetic field , @xmath29 , leads to two polarizations that are not orthogonal and hence incorrect expressions for the fresnel coefficients .",
    "furthermore , we would expect the two polarizations to mix at the interface via the magnetoelectric coupling , hence defining the two polarizations in terms of different fields leads to awkward expressions .",
    "the simplest approach is to work solely with the electric field , @xmath0 .",
    "thus , for media layered in the @xmath30 direction and light incident in the @xmath31 plane , we define the @xmath2 polarization as the polarization with @xmath32 and @xmath33 , @xmath34 and the @xmath3 polarization as the polarization with @xmath35 and @xmath36 , @xmath37 , [ see fig . [ interface ] ] .",
    "we proceed by considering waves of a specific ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) polarization incident on an interface between two homogeneous isotropic tsb - tis . by matching the waves in each half - space using the electromagnetic jump conditions @xmath38",
    "which relate the transverse components of the electric and magnetic fields on either side of the interface , the fresnel coefficients can be found .",
