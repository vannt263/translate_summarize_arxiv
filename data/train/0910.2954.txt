    "@xcite this small parameter is absent in heavy fermion materials since the fermi temperature should be replaced by @xmath5 which might be even smaller than 1k . moreover ,",
    "smallness of the relevant energy scales implies that properties of the ground state can be easily tuned by hamiltonian perturbations .",
    "this observation raises the central question of this paper : what role do phonons play in models of heavy fermions ?",
    "we address this question on the basis of the periodic anderson model ( pam ) on a square lattice with holstein phonons that couple to the conduction band electrons : @xmath10 here , @xmath11 describes the conduction band with dispersion relation @xmath12 and with @xmath13 creating a conduction electron with @xmath14-component of spin @xmath15 and in the bloch state with crystal momentum @xmath16 .",
    "next , @xmath17 accounts for the hybridization with a conduction electron in wannier state centered around unit cell @xmath18 and the localized @xmath19-electron in the same unit cell while the coulomb repulsion set by the hubbard @xmath20 on the @xmath19-orbitals accounts for local moment formation .",
    "finally , @xmath21 corresponds to einstein phonons with a holstein coupling to the conduction electrons .",
    "in fact , the choice between a model in which phonons couple predominately either to the conduction or @xmath19-electrons is material dependent . indeed , retaining the coupling of holstein phonons only to the conduction electrons is justified in the local moment regime where charge fluctuations on the @xmath19-orbitals are suppressed due to the strong coulomb repulsion . in this",
    "limit the model maps onto the kondo lattice model ( klm ) : @xmath22 in contrast , the effect of phonon coupling to the @xmath19-electrons is expected to become more important in the mixed valence regime of moderately heavy fermions such as filled skutterudites as emphasized in ref . .",
    "we use several methods to unravel the physics contained in those model hamiltonians .",
    "arbitrarily low temperatures as well as phonon frequencies may be reached within a combination of the slave - boson ( sb ) mean - field approximation @xcite with the self - consistent calculation of the self - energy diagram of fig .",
    "[ scb.fig ] within migdal - eliashberg @xcite ( me ) approximation .",
    "the former leads to the hybridized band picture of the heavy fermion state while the latter allows one to account for coupling to the phonons .",
    "furthermore , since the sb approximation fails at finite temperatures while the me approach does not capture vertex corrections , we equally use the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) approximation with a recently developed weak coupling continuous - time quantum monte carlo ( ct - qmc ) impurity solver@xcite to include phonon degrees of freedom into the pam .",
    "@xcite finally , in order to access the low temperature limit , we resort to numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) method @xcite as a complementary to the ct - qmc impurity solver applied to the klm ( [ klm ] ) .    to understand the failure of the me approximation for the heavy fermion state , let us start with the phonons coupled to a band of conduction electrons with a flat density of states of width @xmath23 . in this case ,",
    "the self - energy diagram of fig . [ scb.fig ] gives a mass renormalization , @xmath24 and @xmath25 corresponds to the phonon frequency , and @xmath26 is the mass of the bare electron .",
    "@xmath27 corresponds to the dimensionless electron - phonon interaction and we have explicitly included high frequency corrections .        in the adiabatic limit @xmath28",
    ", we can use the above formula with the heavy fermi liquid as a starting point rather than the bare conduction electrons to account for the effect of phonons . as it is reviewed in some details in sec .",
    "[ sec:1 ] , the ratio of the coherence temperature of the heavy fermion state to the fermi temperature of the host metal is given by the quasiparticle ( qp ) residue , @xmath29 this quantity measures the overlap of the qp with a bare conduction electron .",
    "hence , the coupling of the phonons to the heavy fermion quasiparticles will be renormalized by a factor @xmath30 in comparison to the coupling to the bare electron ( i.e. @xmath31 ) .",
    "one equally expects effective bandwidth to be scaled by the same factor z. accounting for these two renormalization factors , and neglecting the high frequency correction in eq .",
    "( [ m_eff_holstein.eq ] ) gives a mass enhancement , @xmath32 where @xmath33 corresponds to the effective mass of the heavy fermion state in the absence of phonons .",
    "therefore , in this limit the coherence scale , @xmath34 is next to unaffected by the inclusion of phonons since @xmath35 even in the strong electron - phonon coupling limit , @xmath36 . in sec .",
    "[ sec:1 ] we verify explicitly this result with the use of a combination of the sb technique and the me approximation . in this case",
    "the coherence temperature is also protected from _ adiabatic _",
    "phonons which stems from their coupling to merely a fraction , @xmath37 , of the heavy qp .    in the high frequency limit ,",
    "@xmath38 the correct starting point is to consider the hamiltonian @xmath39 . neglecting vertex corrections",
    ", one can account for the low energy physics of this hamiltonian within the me approximation .",
    "this approximation describes the formation of quasiparticles with enhanced effective mass set by @xmath40 or equivalently a bandwidth reduced by a factor @xmath41 . from there",
    "onwards one can account for the magnetic impurities .",
    "the hybridization matrix element between the qp and the @xmath19-electron is renormalized by a factor @xmath42 in comparison to the hybridization with the bare electron .",
    "taking into account those two renormalization factors , bandwidth and hybridization , the kondo temperature , @xmath43 , remains invariant at this level of approximation .",
    "hence , as in the adiabatic case , one also expects in this regime a very weak influence of the phonon degrees of freedom on the scales of the heavy fermion state .",
    "this point is confirmed explicitly in sec .",
    "[ sec:1 ] within the me approximation .",
    "therefore , we anticipate that retaining only non crossing diagrams thus omitting vertex corrections leaves the scales of the heavy fermion state next to unaffected .",
    "vertex corrections will clearly play a role since they lead to polaron binding which competes with the kondo screening of the impurity spins .",
    "in particular , integrating out the phonon degrees of freedom yields a retarded attractive interaction .",
    "the retardation is set by @xmath44 and its magnitude by @xmath45 .",
    "this term leads to binding between polarons into singlets and is responsible for the onset of superconductivity . to capture this competition and",

    "@xcite    additionally , in order to gain preliminary insight into the interplay between electron correlations and electron - phonon coupling , we combine the sb technique with the me approximation .",
    "@xcite remarkably , despite obvious flaws there are some regimes where this approach works quite well @xcite and on top it might be systematically improved by including the leading - order vertex corrections in the self - energy calculations . for example , it has widely been used to describe the dynamics of a single hole in the magnetically ordered background of mott insulators and to analyze changes in the qp properties by coupling to various bosonic excitations such as magnons , @xcite phonons , @xcite and orbitons .",
    "@xcite moreover , recent studies of the one - dimensional quarter - filled holstein model have shown that in the temperature range above the onset of the luttinger liquid phase , the approximation is capable of reproducing the temperature dependence of the one - particle spectral function obtained within a cluster extension of the dmft . @xcite",
