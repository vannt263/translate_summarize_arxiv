    "the pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars are among the most studied objects in the modern astrophysics .",
    "the studies of pms stars give us information for the early stages of stellar evolution and an opportunity to test stellar evolution scenarios .",
    "photometric variability in pms stars is a common phenomenon . both classes of pms stars ",
    "low - mass ( m@xmath12m@xmath2 ) t tauri stars ( tts ) and the more massive ( 2m@xmath2<m<8m@xmath2 ) herbig ae / be stars ( haebes ) show different types of photometric variability ( herbst et al . 1994 , 2007 ) .",
    "the study of tts began after the work of joy ( 1945 ) .",
    "their main characteristics are the irregular photometric variability and the emission line spectra .",
    "t tauri stars are separated in two main subclasses : classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) surrounded by spacious circumstellar disks and weak - line ( also called `` naked '' ) t tauri stars ( wtts ) without evidence for disk ( bertout 1989 ) .",
    "herbst et al . ( 2007 ) defined five types of brightness variation concerning pms stars .",
    "the variability of type i is due to cool spots or groups of spots on the stellar surface .",
    "this light variability with amplitudes about 0.03 - 0.3 mag , and in extreme cases reaching 0.8 mag in the @xmath3-band is typical for wtts , but rarely that can also be observed in the ctts .",
    "the type ii of variability shows often irregular variations with larger photometric amplitudes ( 2 - 3 mag ) , associated with highly variable accretion from the circumstellar disk onto the surface of ctts .",
    "the variability of type iii is due to rotating hot spots on stellar surface and only seen in ctts .",
    "periodicity in this type of variability can be observed only for a couple of rotation cycles .",
    "the variability of type iv is due to flare - like variations , which are typical for wtts in @xmath4 and @xmath5-band .",
    "flares are random with different sized amplitudes , as there was no periodicity .",
    "type v of variability is characterized with brightness dips lasting from few days up to several months , which presumably result from circumstellar dust or clouds obscuration .",
    "this type of variability is commonly observed in early type tts and haebes and shows large photometric amplitudes ( up to 2.8 mag in @xmath3-band ) .",
    "the prototype of this group of pms objects with intermediate mass named uxors is ux orionis ( grinin et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "the large amplitude outburst of pms stars are grouped into two main types named after their prototypes : fu orionis ( fuor ; ambartsumian 1971 ) and ex lupi ( exor ; herbig 1989 ) . during the quiescence state fuor and exor stars are probably normally accreting tts with massive circumstellar disks .",
    "the outbursts of both types of variables are generally attributed to a sizable increase in accretion rate from the circumstellar disk onto the stellar surface .",
    "the outbursts of fuor objects with amplitude over 5 mag are very rare , and the rise of brightness is shorter than the decline , while exor objects show frequent ( every few years or a decade ) irregular or relatively brief ( a few months to one year ) outburst with an amplitude of several magnitudes ( up to 5 mag ) .",
    "the five stars from our study are located in the field of `` gulf of mexico '' , near to the new fuor star v2493 cyg erupted in 2010 ( semkov et al .",
    "2010 , 2012 , miller et al . 2011 ) .",
    "`` gulf of mexico '' is a region with active star formation ( armond et al .",
    "2011 ) located between the north america nebula ( ngc 7000 ) and pelican nebula ( ic 5070 ) .",
    "these nebulae are part of a single large hii region w80 .",
    "the `` gulf of mexico '' is rich in young stellar objects , as h@xmath6 emission line stars , flare stars from uv ceti type , tts and haebes .",
    "recently , the results of two extensive photometric studies of pms stars in this field ( findeisen et al .",
    "2013 , poljani beljan et al .",
    "2014 ) have been published .",
    "the photometric @xmath0 data presented in this paper were collected in the period from april 2013 to july 2014 .",
    "the ccd observations were carried out in two observatories with four telescopes : the 2-m ritchey - chrtien - coud ( rcc ) , the 50/70-cm schmidt and the 60-cm cassegrain telescopes of the rozhen national astronomical observatory ( bulgaria ) and the 1.3-m ritchey - chrtien ( rc ) telescope of the skinakas observatory of the university of crete ( greece ) .",
    "the observations were performed with four types of ccd cameras : versarray 1300b at the 2-m rcc telescope , andor dz436-bv at the 1.3-m rc telescope , fli pl16803 at the 50/70-cm schmidt telescope , and fli pl09000 at the 60-cm cassegrain telescope .",
    "the technical parameters and specifications for the cameras used are summarized in table 1 .",
    ".ccd cameras technical parameters and specifications [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table6 ]    the variations in brightness of v2051 cyg in the different bands during the period of our photometric study ( 2000 - 2014 ) are 13.84  14.02 mag for @xmath7-band , 15.39  15.68 mag for @xmath8-band , 16.04  16.77 mag for @xmath3-band , and 17.80  18.35 mag for @xmath4-band .",
    "the observed amplitudes are 0.18 mag for @xmath7-band , 0.29 mag for @xmath8-band , 0.73 mag for @xmath3-band and 0.55 mag for @xmath4-band in same period .    on the basis of the observed flare with amplitude @xmath9 4 mag in @xmath5-band by parsamian et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , the available literature data and the registered in our study low amplitude variability , we classify v2051 cyg as low - mass wtts .",
    "therefore , the variability of the star can be attributed to type iv .",
    "we are continuing to collect regular @xmath0 photometric observations of the field of `` gulf of mexico '' in order to classify the stars from our study with higher accuracy .",
    "for this purpose of obtaining of spectral observations of the young stellar objects in the field of `` gulf of mexico '' will be of great importance .",
    "this study was partly supported by esf and bulgarian ministry of education and science under the contract bg051po001 - 3.3.06 - 0047 .",
    "the research has made use of the nasa s astrophysics data system abstract service ."
