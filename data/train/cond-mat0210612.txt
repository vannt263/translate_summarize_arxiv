    "the model we consider is shown in fig . [ sketch1 ] . a double dot ( dd ) plays the role of a two - level system : the topmost electron in the dd",
    "can either occupy the upper or the lower dot . a mesoscopic two - terminal conductor ( mc ) serves as a detector :",
    "its conductance is sensitive to the charge on the upper dot .",
    "a set of capacitances @xmath0 describes the coupling between charges of system @xmath1 and detector @xmath2 ( we often use the capacitance in series @xmath3 ) .",
    "single electron movement in such a setup was recently measured @xcite .",
    "three different time scales describe the interaction of system and detector : in the system we distinguish the thermal _ relaxation _ to an equilibrium distribution ( described by a rate @xmath4 ) and the often much faster _ decoherence _ of superpositions of states in the upper and lower dot ( described by a rate @xmath5 ) .",
    "the decoherence depends as well on temperature @xmath6 as on the voltage difference @xmath7 between the terminals of the detector .",
    "applying such a voltage difference permits to measure the state of the system which leads to additional decoherence .",
    "the _ measurement _ process takes some time which is needed to overcome the uncertainty due to shot noise in the detector and is characterized by a third rate @xmath8 .",
    "the decoherence rate @xmath5 at zero temperature is intimately related to the measurement rate @xmath8 and satisfies the inequality @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "an important measure of the quality of the detector is the efficiency @xmath10 .",
    "ideally one would like to find detectors with an efficiency @xmath11 .    even in the single channel case an ideal detector @xmath12",
    "is found only under some special conditions ( time - reversal and space - inversion symmetry @xcite ) .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that an efficient multi - channel detector is subject to a _",
    "third _ condition that links sensitivities and shot noises of different channels @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the transmission probability of channel @xmath15 .",
    "a violation of this condition can reduce the efficiency of multichannel detectors @xmath16 drastically in the presence of disorder . in general a large mesoscopic detector is therefore not much faster than a single channel detector .    in this publication",
    "we concentrate on another property that lowers the detection speed of multichannel detectors .",
    "the charge fluctuation in one channel can be screened by the charge of other channels .",
    "this effect will depend strongly on the geometry of the detector . in order to be able to describe a large variety of detectors we therefore represent the mc by a scattering matrix @xmath17 that connects in- and outgoing states ( @xmath18 label left and right reservoir ) .",
    "this enables us to treat multi - channel mcs with arbitrary transmission probabilities @xmath19 .",
    "we only consider the case of weak coupling between mc and dd and may thus use a standard master equation ( bloch - redfield approach @xcite ) in lowest order perturbation theory to study the evolution of the reduced density matrix of the dd . on this level of approximation",
    "the dynamics of the dd is influenced only via the charge fluctuation spectrum @xmath20 of the mc . at low frequencies this spectrum",
    "is fully characterized by a generalized wigner - smith time delay matrix @xcite ( @xmath21 label the reservoirs ) @xmath22 the derivative @xmath23 is taken with respect to the electrostatic potential in the mc .",
    "the following constants that appear also in the context of ac - transport @xcite describe the geometry of the detector ( @xmath24 denotes the electron charge ) @xmath25 @xmath26 corresponds to the density of states at fermi energy in the scattering region , @xmath27 is an effective electrochemical capacitance that characterizes the strength of interaction , @xmath28 expresses the equilibrium contribution @xcite to the charge fluctuation spectrum @xmath20 , and @xmath29 the non - equilibrium contribution @xcite .",
    "the fifth constant @xmath30 is of different origin @xcite and can not be expressed by matrix ( [ density elements ] ) only .",
    "it describes the ratio of detector sensitivity and shot noise in the presence of screening .",
    "the two - level system is conventionally represented by the hamiltonian @xmath31 where @xmath32 denote pauli matrices .",
    "the energy difference between upper and lower dot is @xmath33 and @xmath34 accounts for tunneling between the dots .",
    "the full level splitting is thus @xmath35 .",
    "the relaxation , decoherence and measurement rates are given by the following expressions @xcite ( here and in the following we set @xmath36 ) : @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 they have formally the same appearance as the rates given in @xcite .",
    "the geometric structure of the detector is contained in the five parameters given in ( [ four parameters ] ) . in the following",
    "we analyze the behavior of these parameters to discuss the screening properties of the detector .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 does not exceed the range @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the dimension of the scattering matrix .",
    "this demonstrates that the relaxation and decoherence rates @xmath42 do not simply scale with the number of channels through the system . the multichannel result for the relaxation and decoherence rates",
    "can not be obtained as a sum of rates due to each channel .",
    "the constants @xmath28 and @xmath29 are renormalized by a denominator @xmath43 depending on all channels .",
    "this denominator originates from screening . for a large number @xmath41 of open channels",
    "@xmath28 behaves as @xmath44 whereas the electrochemical capacitance @xmath45 tends to a constant .",
    "the constant @xmath29 decreases also like @xmath44 .",
    "we find therefore the somewhat surprising result that relaxation and decoherence decrease in the large channel limit .",
    "this result is a consequence of screening in the mc which reduces the charge fluctuations with increasing channel number @xmath41 .",
    "we briefly explain the derivation of our results .",
    "the coulomb hamiltonian of our model contains three terms @xmath46 its first term contributes to the level splitting of the dd ( @xmath47 is a background charge depending on the applied voltage @xmath48 ) .",
    "the charging energy @xmath49 must be large compared to @xmath50 to allow us to consider only two levels of the dd . the second term @xmath51 couples system and detector . to derive a master equation for the reduced density matrix we assume weak coupling and treat this term perturbatively .",
    "we apply a markov approximation which is strictly speaking only valid at long time scales ( compared to the correlation time of the detector ) .",
    "this permits us to consider only the low - frequency matrix elements of the charge operator that are given by the wigner - smith matrix ( [ density elements ] ) .",
    "the third term affects the fluctuation spectrum @xmath52 of the charge operator @xmath53 .",
    "in contrast to earlier work ( with the exception of ref .",
    "@xcite ) we do not completely disregard this term , but include it on the level of rpa .",
    "this allows us to treat screening in a gaussian approximation valid for geometries in which coulomb blockade effects are weak .    to get insight into the fluctuation spectrum , we study the time evolution of the charge @xmath53 on the mc within rpa",
    "this charge is composed of two components : the bare charge @xmath54 that arises from the noninteracting problem and the screening charge which is a response to the self - consistent potential @xmath55 on the mc .",
    "we therefore have in frequency representation @xmath56 in the first equation , @xmath57 is the linear response function .",
    "the second equation expresses the self - consistency condition for the potential @xmath55 .",
    "these two equations can be combined by eliminating the potential @xmath55 . the total charge on the mc is found to be @xmath58 this result shows nicely the two possible effects of the random phase approximation . on the one hand , the prefactor @xmath59 reduces the fluctuations of the bare charge @xmath54 which is compensated partially by a screening charge . on the other hand , we get a back action of the charge @xmath60 of the upper dot on the charge @xmath53 in the mc .",
    "however , this back action is small by a factor @xmath61 and can be omitted in second order perturbation theory .",
    "the examples of this section are not meant to model the geometry of a realistic measuring apparatus .",
    "but they demonstrate nicely the influence of the geometry on the speed and efficiency of the measuring process .    as a first generic example we discuss a * short quantum point contact * which is defined by two sharp barriers of distance @xmath62 .",
    "its potential is given by @xmath63 with @xmath64.\\ ] ] note that this potential violates inversion symmetry for @xmath65 .",
    "for convenience we introduce the following parameters : the wave vector @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the effective mass of the electron and @xmath68 the fermi energy .",
    "we consider the limit of a mc much shorter than the fermi wave length @xmath69 .",
    "using the general formula ( [ density elements ] ) we calculate the density of state matrix ( we set @xmath36 ) @xmath70 it is now straightforward to obtain the measurement efficiency of the mc at zero temperature @xmath71 for an asymmetric mc with @xmath65 the efficiency is suboptimal .    for a * long quantum point contact * with @xmath72 charge screening",
    "gets effective .",
    "the constants @xmath28 and @xmath29 that determine the relaxation and decoherence rates then decrease with increasing number of open channels @xmath41 .",
    "we illustrate this effect using the following toy potential @xmath73 its scattering matrix can be found in @xcite . to get the full density of state matrix ( [ density elements ] ) we replace the potential derivative @xmath23 in ( [ density elements ] ) by a parametric derivative @xmath74 .",
    "the elements of ( [ density elements ] ) can be expressed by digamma - functions . as a confining potential",
    "we choose @xmath75 . as in a two - dimensional electron gas",
    "only the lowest mode in z - direction is occupied .",
    "[ integrable qpc ] compares the cases of ineffective charge screening @xmath76 and effective screening @xmath77 .",
    "it shows the decoherence ( measurement ) rate at zero temperature @xmath6 and finite bias @xmath7 depending on the number of open channels through the constriction .",
    "we change this number by varying the confinement frequency @xmath78 .",
    "the decoherence rate reaches maximal values if one transmission channel @xmath15 is half - open @xmath79 .",
    "this corresponds to a maximum in the sensitivity @xmath80 . in the case of",
    "ineffective screening the decoherence rate does not depend on the number of open channels , whereas screening reduces decoherence in the case of many open channels .",
    "in this work we have investigated the weak measurement of a two state system ( a double quantum dot ) capacitively coupled to a mesoscopic conductor .",
    "we have presented expressions for the relaxation rate , the decoherence rate and the measurement rate in terms of capacitance coefficients and in terms of potential derivatives of the scattering matrix .",
    "the discussion illustrates that scattering theory is useful not only for the discussion of dc - transport processes in mesoscopic physics but in fact has a much wider range of applicability .",
    "we have emphasized screening in the detector : as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ integrable qpc ] the decoherence rate and similarly the relaxation and measurement rate ) are rappidly reduced with increasing channel number .",
