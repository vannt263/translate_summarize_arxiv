    "the propagation of neutrinos and their associated flavor transformation is a fascinating problem with many applications . often neutrinos are propagating through environments where the background potential is not smooth .",
    "examples include propagation through the earth , the sun , supernovae , hypernovae , black hole accretion disks , compact object mergers , and the early universe .",
    "fluctuations can occur on many scales in these complex environments , and it is important to understand which density fluctuation scales will influence neutrino flavor transformation .",
    "there is a long history of research into msw - type oscillations due to the small scale fluctuations in the earth and sun @xcite , as well as the large , even turbulent fluctuations in supernovae @xcite . in a supernova environment ,",
    "neutrino - neutrino interactions must also be considered @xcite .",
    "recently , the effects of density fluctuations on collective neutrino oscillations have been studied @xcite . however , in order to fully understand these effects , turbulence and the fluctuation scales which are most important the various types of neutrino oscillations must be identified .    in many of the previous works on neutrino propagation through density fluctuations , either the probability distribution of an ensemble of neutrinos or moments of the distribution @xcite have been studied .",
    "an ensemble consists of neutrinos traveling through many different realizations of turbulence . under certain conditions",
    "such an ensemble will become fully depolarized @xcite .",
    "in general for n flavors the depolarization limit is where the final distribution of transition probabilities @xmath1 is proportional to @xmath2 with a mean of 1/n @xcite .",
    "however , it is not always appropriate to use a completely depolarized distribution to characterize the survival probabilities of neutrinos . depending on the typical history of the neutrinos , it may be better to describe the ensemble with a different distribution , to consider a subset of a distribution through the use of correlations , or to consider individual neutrinos .",
    "whether considering individual neutrinos , constructing the probability distribution of an ensemble , or computing correlations , the relevant physics is the type and strength of transitions that a neutrino will undergo .",
    "the description of density fluctuations is often a fourier decomposition into sinusoids , which will produce arbitrarily complicated density distributions depending on the number of modes used .",
    "the simplest case is that of a single sinusoidal perturbation super - imposed upon a constant density fluctuation .",
    "neutrinos traveling through this potential can exhibit transitions between states called parametric resonances @xcite .",
    "parametric resonances are distinct from msw - type transformations and occur not only when the scale of the sinusoidal fluctuation corresponds to the neutrino mass splitting , but also when it corresponds to harmonics of the mass splitting @xcite",
    ". a true understanding of which conditions will cause parametric type transitions requires an analytic description of the survival probability of individual neutrinos going through turbulent profiles . in this paper",
    "we solve this problem .",
    "we consider neutrino flavor propagation through complicated density profiles , testing examples of up to fifty sinusoids .",
    "we first present a numerical flavor transformation calculation through such a profile , then derive an analytic solution for the flavor transformation probability . comparing this expression to the numerical flavor transformation calculations ,",
    "we demonstrate that the analytic expression effectively predicts , on a case by case basis , neutrino flavor transformation probabilities as a function of distance .",
    "this expression also makes clear the most important density perturbation scales .",
    "not only are the perturbations with wavelengths that correspond to the neutrino mass splitting important , there are additional longer wavelength modes that , if present , can suppress the parametric resonance transitions .",
    "this second scale is only weakly dependent on the other scales in the problem , such as @xmath3 and the energy of the neutrino .",
    "in fact , it depends most strongly on the amplitude of the perturbation .",
    "thus , we show that for any problem involving neutrino flavor transformation through a medium , it is necessary to understand density fluctuations on two length scales : the scale of the neutrino mass splitting @xmath4^{-1/2}$ ] , and the scale that corresponds to the amplitude of the density fluctuations @xmath5 .",
    "the physical quantity we aim to calculate is the probability that an initial neutrino state @xmath6 at @xmath7 is later detected as the state @xmath8 at @xmath9 .",
    "this probability can be computed from the @xmath10-matrix which relates the initial and final neutrino states by the equation @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10-matrix evolves according to the differential equation @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the hamiltonian . in the flavor basis @xmath13",
    "is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the vacuum mixing matrix , @xmath16 is the diagonal matrix of vacuum eigenvalues and @xmath17 some ` potential '",
    ". we shall assume the potential @xmath18 possesses a ` smooth ' component , which we denote by @xmath19 , and a ` perturbation ' @xmath20 . with this assumption",
    "we can regroup the hamiltonian into @xmath21 .",
    "we now enforce the requirement that the potential @xmath18 is ` msw ' like in the sense that the only non - zero entry of @xmath17 is @xmath22 and that the component @xmath23 is a constant , @xmath24 .",
    "we now focus upon the perturbation and consider the case where @xmath20 is built from a series of @xmath25 sinusoidal fluctuations with wavenumbers @xmath26 , amplitudes @xmath27 and phase shifts @xmath28 . like @xmath19 , we restrict ourselves to the case where only @xmath29 is non - zero . in full the perturbation is written as @xmath30 turbulence is often represented as a fourier series of exactly this form with realizations generated by assigning random values for the amplitudes , wavenumbers and phase factors according to some algorithm .",
    "the phases @xmath31 are typically uniformly distributed from zero to @xmath32 but the random amplitudes and wavenumbers are generated using algorithms that are functions of the power spectrum .",
    "two commonly considered cases are the white - noise power spectrum and the case where the power spectrum is an inverse power law .     of the potential is set to be one half the msw resonance for a @xmath33 neutrino with mixing angle @xmath34 and mass splitting @xmath35 .",
    "the turbulence is composed of @xmath36 sinusoids using the algorithm described in the text . ]    ) .",
    "the sinusoidal curve marked ` rwa ' is an analytical prediction for the evolution . ]    in figure ( [ fig:1 ] ) we show a realization of the white - noise case using @xmath37 where the wavenumbers are uniformly distributed between @xmath38 and @xmath39 and the amplitudes are uniformly distributed between 0 and 0.02 .",
    "the probability we report is the transition probability between the eigenstates of @xmath40 .",
    "the eigenbasis of @xmath40 - which we call the unperturbed matter basis , denoted by superscript @xmath41 - is related to the flavor basis by the unitary mixing matrix @xmath42 defined by the requirement that it diagonalize @xmath43 i.e.  @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues , @xmath46 , of @xmath40 .",
    "note that the unperturbed matter basis is not equivalent to the instantaneous matter basis .",
    "the unperturbed matter basis includes only the smooth potential @xmath19 , and not the perturbation @xmath20 .",
    "the unperturbed matter basis is the most suitable basis to calculate the transition probability because transitions vanish when the perturbation vanishes .",
    "the numerical solution for the transition probability for a two - flavor neutrino ( we use two - flavors only for the sake of simplicity ) with an energy of @xmath47 , vacuum mixing angle of @xmath34 and mass splitting @xmath48 , through the turbulence in figure ( [ fig:1 ] ) can be observed in figure ( [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "the mean @xmath24 of the potential in figure ( [ fig:1 ] ) was set to be one half the msw resonance potential for this energy and mixing parameters .",
    "the evolution of @xmath49 is really quite remarkable : given the density profile shown in figure ( [ fig:1 ] ) one might expect that either the solution for @xmath49 would drift gradually to @xmath50 or that @xmath49 would evolve as chaotically as the potential .",
    "the actual evolution of @xmath49 does neither of these things : it is quasi periodic containing a prominent sinusoidal mode .",
    "the curve marked ` rwa ' in the figure is a prediction for this component that we now describe .",
    "our analytical treatment for the effect of multiple sinusoidal density fluctuations is a generalization of the treatment presented in kneller , mclaughlin & patton @xcite for a single sinusoid .",
    "although it is possible to solve this problem with arbitrary numbers of neutrino flavors , we shall restrict ourselves to just two , again , for the sake of clarity .",
    "our first step is to transform the problem into the unperturbed matter basis using the mixing matrix @xmath42 .",
    "after this transformation , the hamiltonian is written as @xmath51 we write the @xmath10-matrix for the unperturbed matter basis as the product @xmath52 where @xmath53 is solution of the unperturbed problem i.e. the constant density hamiltonian @xmath40 , defined by the equation @xmath54 \\,\\breve{s}.\\ ] ] note that we have suppressed the factors of @xmath55 that occur in the s - matrix equation .",
    "for this potential @xmath53 is simply @xmath56 because the eigenvalues of @xmath40 are constant .",
    "since @xmath53 is known we can solve for the effect of the perturbation @xmath20 by finding the solution for @xmath57 , given by the differential equation @xmath58 the hamiltonian for @xmath57 possesses both diagonal and off - diagonal elements but those diagonal elements can be removed by writing the matrix @xmath57 as @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 is a diagonal matrix @xmath62 , see @xcite .",

    "the next step is to use the jacobi - anger expansion for the complex exponentials @xmath72 @xmath73 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the bessel j function and , in order to tidy up the notation , we have introduced the quantities @xmath75 defined to be @xmath76 in eq .",

    "this form for the components of the hamiltonian closely matches that found for similar systems in molecular physics , such as that studied in kondo , blokker , & meath @xcite .    to make additional progress we make use of the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) and drop all terms in each infinite series - the @xmath86 s and @xmath87 s - in equation ( [ eq : hij ] ) except the most ` important ' .",
    "the most important set of integers can be found from the criterion used for the case of a single sinusoidal perturbation .",
    "we select the values for the @xmath86 s which come closest to satisfying the parametric resonance condition @xmath88 .",
    "we denote these values by @xmath89 .",
    "the rwa removes the sum over each @xmath86 and @xmath87 and we can define the quantity @xmath90 after making the rwa we can write out the solution for @xmath63 after introducing @xmath91 and @xmath92 , see kneller , mclaughlin & patton @xcite .",
    "the rwa allows us to write the differential equation for @xmath63 as @xmath93 and define the rwa hamiltonian as @xmath94 following the procedure outlined in @xcite , we find the solution for @xmath63 is @xmath95 & -\\imath e^{\\imath p r}\\,\\frac{\\kappa}{q}\\sin(q r ) \\\\",

    "\\end{split}\\ ] ]    since we assumed the unperturbed potential was a constant , the unperturbed matrix @xmath53 and the matrix @xmath96 are diagonal matrices , so we find that the transition probability between the unperturbed matter states 1 and 2 is of the form @xmath97 in practice we found that when the number of sinusoids @xmath25 is large it is computationally prohibitive to locate the values of the @xmath25 integers which minimize the phase @xmath98 via a scan .",
    "when @xmath25 is large our strategy for locating the rwa solution is to use @xmath99 , or the negative of the amplitude , as a ` potential ' in the @xmath25 dimensional space of integers and then locate the minimum of the potential using a simplex .",
    "the rwa solution for the turbulence shown in figure ( [ fig:1 ] ) - using the simplex algorithm to locate the integers - is the second solution shown in figure ( [ fig:2 ] ) marked ` rwa ' .",
    "the reader will observe that it is a good description of both the amplitude and the wavelength of the dominant sinusoidal component of @xmath49 .",
    "the success of the rwa solution shown in figure ( [ fig:2 ] ) indicates the theory describes the overall features of the numerical solution well .",
    "the rwa solution obviously depends upon those wavenumbers with non - zero contributions to fulfilling the parametric resonance condition @xmath100 . defining @xmath101 for these modes",
    ", we find the scale given in the introduction .",
    "but that is _ not _ the whole story : the quantity @xmath85 , which controls the amplitude and the wavelength of the transitions , actually depends upon _ every _ wavenumber even if the rwa solution indicates it does so with @xmath102 .    to understand this effect , consider equation ( [ eq : idbdr ] ) .",
    "we can break the matrix elements of the hamiltonian in this equation into three parts .",
    "the coefficient of the exponential , @xmath103 , or the complex conjugate , is an operator which connects the two neutrino states .",
    "the complex exponential @xmath104 is the unperturbed solution to the problem and it describes the evolution of the neutrinos in the constant density potential . finally , the complex exponential @xmath105 is the distortion to the unperturbed solution by the diagonal elements of @xmath20 .",
    "this distortion reflects the modification of oscillation frequency of the unperturbed system .",
    "as we discuss in the following paragraphs , the modes which cause the parametric resonance transitions create little change in this frequency , but longer wavelength modes can create larger changes .    this term can be written as a product of the distortions from each individual mode : @xmath106 recall that in deriving the solution [ eq : p_12 ] we expanded each @xmath107 using the jacobi - anger expansion [ eq : jaexpansion ] , and retained only the relevant @xmath89 term .",
    "for the modes which do nt contribute to the parametric resonance , this is the @xmath108 term . through an identity of bessel functions",
    "this term can be written as @xmath109 = \\langle e^{\\imath \\delta \\xi_{12 a } } \\rangle,\\ ] ] where the average value is defined explicitly as @xmath110 thus for all the modes that do nt contribute to the parametric resonance , each distortion can be represented by an average value and the oscillatory terms in the jacobi - anger expansion in equation ( [ eq : jaexpansion ] ) can be neglected .",
    "as long as the average value of the distortion , @xmath111 , for all these modes is close to unity , then these modes which do nt contribute to the parametric resonance make only small modifications to the amplitude and wavelength of the solution [ eq : p_12 ] .",
    "but when the average value of the distortion is large , i.e.  @xmath112 , then these modes can significantly modify they amplitude and wavelength of the solution even though the do not contribute to the parametric resonance !    examining the argument of the bessel function , @xmath113 , we see that the criteria for determining whether a mode causes significant distortion is the ratio of its amplitude to its wavenumber . as long as the fluctuation amplitude @xmath114 is much smaller than the wavenumber @xmath115 , then @xmath116 , and that mode will cause little distortion . however , if @xmath117 then the value of the bessel function will be small and there will be considerable distortion , @xmath118 .",
    "in addition , if there is a mode for which the value of @xmath75 hits a zero of a bessel function then there is maximal distortion @xmath119 . in these situations ,",
    "the transitions are extraordinarily strongly suppressed since the distortion of all the modes appears as a multiplicative factor .",
    "we can identify the largest wavenumbers which cause significant distortion by examining the point where @xmath120 hits its first zero , the first of which occurs when @xmath121 . using equation ( [ eq : zdef ] )",
    ", we find the wavenumbers of interest by setting @xmath122 .",
    "if we define @xmath123 for these modes , we find the expression given in the introduction . from the scaling of @xmath75 with @xmath115 we discover it is the long wavelength modes which dominate this effect , not the small wavelengths .",
    "we show this dependence upon the long wavelength turbulence modes by generating the two turbulence density profiles shown in figure ( [ fig:3 ] ) using an inverse power law spectrum ( see @xcite for a description of the algorithm we use for this case ) with the rms amplitude of the turbulence set to 0.05 , a spectral index of @xmath124 , and a long wavelength cutoff set to @xmath125 .",
    "since @xmath24 is only half the msw density , it is would require an extremely unlikely , @xmath126 , fluctuation to approach the msw density with this turbulence amplitude .",
    "after generating the turbulence , we slightly increased the wavelength and amplitude of the longest wavelength mode by hand to give @xmath127 .",
    "the only difference between the two profiles is that the five longest wavelength modes from the top panel have been removed for the lower .",
    "the missing modes possess wavenumbers many orders of magnitude smaller than the eigenvalue splitting @xmath128 .",
    "the rwa solution for these realizations are found to be @xmath102 for every mode , including the five longest wavelengths , except for one mode which happens to satisfy the parametric resonance condition by itself .",
    "if there were no dependence upon the wavelengths where @xmath102 then removing the five longest wavelength modes should not change the solution .",
    "however , when we actually solve for @xmath49 with and without these five wavelengths we do find different solutions as shown in figure ( [ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "note that the horizontal scale on the figure is more than one hundred times larger than the longest wavelength mode in the turbulence i.e.  the cutoff . without the five longest wavelengths the amplitude of the transition is unity and the wavelength of order @xmath129 : with the five longest wavelengths the amplitude is only @xmath130 and the wavelength stretches to @xmath131 .",
    "inspection of the values of @xmath75 for the five modes indicates they all lie in the vicinity of the first root of @xmath0 .",
    "the distortion predicted from these five modes together , obtained by multiplying the individual distortions given by equation ( [ eq : distortion ] ) , is @xmath132 .",
    "this is mainly due to the first mode , which had @xmath127 , although the other four missing modes also contribute .",
    "even though these five modes all have @xmath102 , they still have a strong effect on the transition .    the example shown in figure ( [ fig:4 ] )",
    "was specifically tailored to show how dramatic the suppression effect can be .",
    "however , we also found that it occurs in more general examples . using a white noise spectrum with wavelengths between",
    "3 km and 300 km and amplitudes up to 0.025 , 20 examples with @xmath133 where a parametric resonance occurred were found .",
    "we added @xmath134 extra modes with wavelengths between 300 km and 3000 km , then 300 km to 30000 km , to those original white noise spectra .",
    "this resulted in perturbations with @xmath135 that were known to have a parametric resonance , but also had the possibility of exhibiting suppression . in approximately half of the trials ,",
    "the amplitudes found in the numeric simulations showed suppression varying from just a few percent to almost 50% . from these results",
    ", we expect that suppression will occur for approximately half of turbulent spectra , with the degree of suppression depending on the values of wavelength and corresponding amplitudes within the spectrum .",
    "finally , we note the analogy , with the stark effect for a two - level atom . for a two - level atom",
    ", transitions are stimulated between the states by a laser if the laser frequency matches the energy splitting of the system . placing the atom in an external electric field causes shifts in the wave functions and energies of the original ( unperturbed ) states .",
    "once this shift occurs , a laser that stimulated transitions prior to the application of the electric field can no longer do so . in the neutrino case ,",
    "the `` lasers '' are the modes fulfilling the parametric resonance condition , and the external electric field corresponds to modes with @xmath108 .",
    "understanding neutrino propagation through turbulent media is essential to understanding future measurements of supernova neutrino spectra .",
    "while previous treatments have focused primarily on the behavior of ensemble averages , we have instead considered the exact propagation of single neutrinos .",
    "our analytic results show that density perturbations play two roles .",
    "we confirm that density perturbations can cause transition between states . even in very complicated density profiles the density fluctuations that occur on wavelengths that match the natural wavelength of the neutrinos cause the biggest transition .",
    "however , we find that longer wavelength density fluctuations also _ suppress _ transitions .",
    "they do so by causing the basis state to significantly fluctuate away from its original state on scales shorter than the parametric resonance transition .",
    "a clear implication of these results is that in any environment where neutrinos propagate , it is important to understand the density fluctuations both on the scale of the effective mass splitting and on the scales where the amplitude of the fluctuation corresponds to its wavenumber . together with the results presented in this paper , this information can be used to determine the strength and number of transitions a neutrino will experience as it passes through a turbulent ensemble .",
    "this aids in determining the applicability of the depolarization limit of an ensemble of neutrinos .",
