    "the thermal conductivity of semiconductor superlattices is strongly reduced with respect to the bulk values of their constituents @xcite .",
    "the heat is mainly carried by phonons and two mechanisms can explain the effects of the nanostructuration on thermal transport . according to the first ( _ intrinsic _ ) mechanism , the zone - folding involves a modification of the phonon dispersion and allows umklapp process for low energy phonons @xcite . according to the second ( _ extrinsic _ ) mechanism ,",
    "phonons are scattered by imperfections at the interfaces @xcite . of course",
    ", both mechanisms can be active but their relative contributions is still under debate , mainly for short period superlattices @xcite .",
    "the assessement of the interface role relies on discrepancies between theoretical calculations , based on intrinsic mechanisms only , and experimental observations . in order to take into account interfaces defects ,",
    "some authors @xcite combined the phonon dispersion curves arising from zone folding and interface scattering in order to fit experimental results on gaas / alas superlattices @xcite .",
    "mini - umklapp processes were not considered and the phonon mean free path in the layers was supposed to be identical to the corresponding bulk value .",
    "these authors derived that 17% of the incident phonons on an interface undergo diffuse scattering , because of interface defects . recently , other authors solved the boltzmann s equation in superlattices , beyong the constant relaxation time approximation @xcite .",
    "they adressed the role of the mini - umklapp process and computed the contribution of the intrinsic mechanism to the thermal conductivity . comparing their results with experimental data , they inferred that , in ( gaas)@xmath3(alas)@xmath3 , `` the reduction due to extrinsic phonon scattering is roughly three times larger than that due to intrinsic scattering '' .",
    "molecular dynamics calculations also stressed the importance of interface defects @xcite .",
    "gaas / alas superlattices were simulated with a simplified structure : the two - atom unit cells of gaas and alas are substituted for single average atoms and the interface defects are obtained by assigning at random the atomic sites in the last monoatomic layer of each superlattice layer to an ( average ) atom or to the other , with a given probability .",
    "a 60% decrease of the thermal conductivity was then predicted in ( gaas)@xmath4(alas)@xmath4 for a 50% substitution probability @xcite .",
    "lastly , the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity gives clues on interface scattering effects @xcite .    to our knowledge",
    ", no experiment has addressed directly the role of interface imperfections . in this paper",
    ", we report on experiments performed in ( gaas)@xmath0(alas)@xmath1 superlattices exhibiting different interface width .",
    "we have measured their cross - plane thermal conductivity , using the so - called differential @xmath2 technique , at room temperature @xcite .",
    "the samples are gaas / alas superlattices grown by molecular beam epitaxy , on gaas buffers .",
    "the nominal widths of gaas and alas layers are 2.5  nm and 1.5  nm , respectively , and the number of gaas - alas periods is 120 .",
    "table ( [ tab : results ] ) displays the actual periods determined by x - ray diffraction , versus samples .",
    "ideal interfaces are infinite atomically flat planes separating pure gaas and alas layers . however , actual interfaces exhibit islandlike structures , characterized by their lateral extent and by their height ( in terms of monolayers ) .",
    "direct interfaces ( alas grown on gaas ) tend to exhibit large islands ( lateral extent from @xmath5 to @xmath6 nm ) , whereas inverse interfaces ( gaas grown on alas ) tend to exhibit smaller islands ( lateral extent @xmath7 to @xmath8 nm ) .",
    "compositional fluctuations inside large islands may also occur .",
    "the quality of actual interfaces depend on a number of parameters , including growth temperature , interruption time ... and are usually characterized either by photoluminescence @xcite or by raman scattering @xcite .",
    "photoluminescence is sensitive to large scale fluctuations , whereas raman scattering is sensitive to small scale fluctuations .",
    "small scale fluctuations lead to an effective concentration profile at the interfaces which can be evaluated by raman scattering and can be used to characterized the interface width @xcite .",
    "our samples were grown under the same conditions , except for the substrate temperature @xmath9 , between 510 and 650  c. in that range , small scale interface fluctuations are very sensitive to the growth temperature @xcite .    indeed , the very samples that we have studied were characterized previously by raman scattering @xcite .",
    "the intensity and frequency shift of the raman lines were analyzed in term of interface broadening .",
    "identical broadening was assumed for all interfaces .",
    "table ( [ tab : results ] ) gives the interface width @xmath10 , determined from the analysis of the confined optical modes .",
    "the samples are labelled with the same name s1 , s2 and s4 as in @xcite .",
    "clearly , the interface width increases as the growth temperature increases .",
    "we use the differential @xmath2 method @xcite to measure thermal conductivity of three superlattices , grown on gaas substrates : s1 , s2 and s4 .",
    "we compare their thermal responses with the responses of gaas test samples t1 , t2 and t3 .",
    "previously , a thin ( 100  nm ) dielectric sio@xmath11 layer is sputtered on s1 , s2 , s4 , t1 , t2 and t3 in order to insure electrical isolation between thermal transducers and samples @xcite .",
    "the insulating sio@xmath11 layer is deposited in a same run on the samples and test samples . moreover , during sputtering , the samples and test samples are mounted on a rotating substrate holder . in this way , the insulating layers thickness is found to be nearly constant on t1 , t2 and t3 : 104 , 102 and 105  nm , as measured by ellipsometry .",
    "we extrapolate that insulating layer thickness is constant on s1 , s2 , s4 , t1 , t2 and t3 , within 1.5% .",
    "thermal transducers are processed by lift - off photolithography and thermal evaporation of gold ( 200 nm ) on a thin chromium adhesion layer ( few nm ) .",
    "the typical line width is @xmath12 ( s1 : @xmath13 , s2 : @xmath14 , s3 : @xmath15 , t1 : @xmath16 , t2 : @xmath17 , t3 : @xmath18 ) .",
    "the line length is @xmath19 ( s1 , s2 , s4 ) or @xmath20 ( t1 , t2 , t3 ) . the ratio of the heater line width to the films thickness is around @xmath21 .",
    "this ratio is large enough to insure one - dimensional heat flow through the films and measurement of cross - plane conductivities .",

    "our results lie in the same range as previously reported for gaas / alas superlattices , although direct comparison is hindered by the different periodicities of the samples @xcite .",

    "as long as those variations are concerned , @xmath47 variations from sample to sample must be considered , rather than the actual values and uncertainty on @xmath47 .",
    "those variations come from possible thickness variations and are estimated to be smaller than @xmath56 , in agreement with thickness measurements on t1 , t2 , t3 . taking into account the uncertainty on the thermal resistance of the layers on s1 , s2 , s4 and the possible variation of the thermal resistance of the sio@xmath49 layers , figure ( [ fig : k_sr ] ) displays superlattice thermal conductivity variation , versus interface width . clearly , s1 and s2 exhibit close thermal conductivities whereas s4 exhibits a significantly smaller thermal conductivity .",
    "our data analysis neglects the boundary thermal resistances between the various layers ( line / insulating film , insulating film / superlattice , superlattice / substrate , insulating film / substrate ) .",
    "however , we may assume the boundary resistances are the same in the various samples . in that case ,",
    "their contributions are partly cancelled out by the comparison process between samples and test samples .",

    "in ( gaas)@xmath0(alas)@xmath1 , the superlattice period @xmath60 is much smaller than the thermal phonon mean free path @xmath34 in the bulk constituents ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 @xcite ) . in this",
    "so called `` short period superlattice '' regime , we expect the interface defects to modify significantly the phonons mean free path and , as a consequence , the thermal conductivity .",
    "this is confirmed by molecular dynamics calculations .",

    "it is located at the last atomic layer in each superlattice layer and the foreign atoms concentration is 50% .",
    "a 60% reduction of the thermal conductivity is then inferred in ( gaas)@xmath4(alas)@xmath4 @xcite . on the basis of the above comparison",
    ", we conclude that our samples lie in a range where the interface damage should indeed have an impact on the thermal conductivity of our samples .",
    "large changes of the total phonon mean free path and of the thermal conductivity have been predicted when diffuse scattering is introduced at the interfaces @xcite .",
    "the largest sensitivity is achieved for small amounts of diffuse scattering .",
    "therefore , the conductivity variation between s1 and s2 is surprisingly small .",
    "the conductivity variation which is observed between s1 and s4 is consistent with the order of magnitude predicted from molecular dynamics .",
    "however , the 30% variation which is measured appears to be quite small with respect the 60% variation predicted for a less severe interface damage .",

    "the small scale roughness is characterized by an effective interface width @xmath10 , on the basis of previous raman scattering experiments . within error bars ,",
    "no variation of thermal conductivity is observed between @xmath66 and @xmath58 , and a 30% decrease is observed between @xmath66 and @xmath59 . on the basis of existing calculations , the sensitivity of the thermal conductivity to the small scale interface roughness seems to be not as strong as expected .",
