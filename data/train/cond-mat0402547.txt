    "<S> we investigated the origin of the energy splitting observed in the resonant x - ray scattering ( rxs ) in manganites . using thin film samples with controlled lattice parameters and orbital states at a fixed orbital filling </S>",
    "<S> , we estimated that the contribution of the interatomic coulomb interaction relative to the jahn - teller mechanism is insignificant and at most 0.27 . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that rxs probes mainly jahn - teller distortion in manganites .    </S>",
    "<S> hole - doped manganites with perovskite structure , @xmath0mno@xmath1 ( @xmath2 is a trivalent rare - earth ion and @xmath3 is a divalent alkaline - earth ion ) show a variety of phases with doping concentration @xmath4 . in these compounds , double - exchange interaction has been considered most important , which closely couples spin with charge degree of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has been recently recognized that double - exchange alone is not enough to account for the peculiar properties of manganites . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical and experimental studies have shown the importance of the orbital degree of freedom to understand the rich phase diagrams  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the direct information of the orbital ordering has been lacking due to the dearth of proper experimental means until murakami _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> proposed the use of resonant x - ray scattering ( rxs)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> anisotropic charge distribution in an atom results in the anisotropy in the x - ray susceptibility near the absorption edge . </S>",
    "<S> this gives rise to x - ray dichroism and scattering intensity at structurally forbidden bragg reflections for polarized x - ray  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they exploited this technique and succeeded in detecting the resonant scattering from superlattice reflections , which has been interpreted as a signature of the antiferro - type orbital ordering . </S>",
    "<S> the resonance at main edge corresponds to the dipolar transition from @xmath5 to unoccupied @xmath6 level ( mn @xmath7-edge ) , and the split of the @xmath6 levels is the origin of the anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> it has been argued that the rxs reflects the @xmath8 orbital ordering because the anisotropic @xmath8 charge distribution causes the @xmath6 splitting via the coulomb repulsion  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , this interpretation has been later challenged ; the @xmath6 splitting is the result of jahn - teller distortion rather than the @xmath8 orbital polarization  [ 8 - 12 ] . </S>",
    "<S> there has been no definitive answer to these conflicting views .    in order to distinguish the two mechanisms , we have performed rxs measurements of samples with controlled lattice constant and orbital ordering at a fixed orbital filling ( i.e. , the average number of electrons occupying the @xmath9 orbital ) . </S>",
    "<S> an epitaxially grown film is suitable for this purpose because the epitaxial strain makes possible to artificially modify the lattice constant . </S>",
    "<S> thin films in this paper were all deposited on srtio@xmath1 ( 001 ) substrate and their hole concentration was fixed to 0.4 , i.e. , 0.6 in the orbital filling . </S>",
    "<S> the composition of the films was @xmath10sr@xmath11mno@xmath1 , where @xmath2 was la , la@xmath12pr@xmath11 , la@xmath13pr@xmath14 , pr , pr@xmath12nd@xmath11 , or nd in the decreasing order of average ionic size with correspondingly shorter out - of - plane lattice constant ( @xmath15-axis ) ( _ vide infra _ ) . </S>",
    "<S> the in - plane lattice constant ( @xmath16-axis ) was fixed to that of the substrate . </S>",
    "<S> bulk crystals of identical composition are all ferromagnetic metal ( fm ) in the ground state  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> because the modulation of orbital states alters the magnetic , transport , and optical properties of thin film manganites  [ 14 - 16 ] , any deviation from fm in our film signals the change in the orbital state . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice constant of srtio@xmath1 is 3.905  , which is larger than those of these compounds in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> our epitaxial films were thus laterally stretched causing a split in the doubly degenerate @xmath17 orbitals into @xmath18 at lower level and @xmath19 at higher level . therefore , one probable orbital state is the @xmath18-type orbital order accompanied by the layer - type ( a - type ) antiferromagnetic ( a - af ) state , typified by bulk crystals of nd@xmath20sr@xmath21mno@xmath1  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the orbital ordering promotes in - plane transport , which brings about in - plane ferromagnetic coupling by double - exchange interaction and out - of - plane antiferromagnetic coupling by superexchange interaction . </S>",
    "<S> as will be shown later , the magnetic and magnetotransport measurements indicate that we have indeed films ranging from fm to a - af .    </S>",
    "<S> rxs measurements were performed at beam - line 4c and 9c at photon factory , kek , tsukuba , employing newly - developed interference technique by kiyama  _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we observed energy dependence of interference term from ( 102 ) reflection of la@xmath12sr@xmath11mno@xmath1 ( lsmo ) , pr@xmath12sr@xmath11mno@xmath1 ( psmo ) and nd@xmath12sr@xmath11mno@xmath1 ( nsmo ) films at various azimuthal angles with the photon energy near the mn @xmath7-absorption edge . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the jahn - teller mechanism has dominant influence on mn @xmath6 splitting , which is consistent with other reports for manganite thin films  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> thin film samples were grown using pulsed laser deposition technique  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the thickness of the films was about 50  nm . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray diffraction measurements for @xmath22 and @xmath23 reflection peaks confirmed that all films grew epitaxially with a ( 001 ) orientation and that the out - of - plane lattice constant systematically decreased as the @xmath3-site ion was replaced by a smaller ion as depicted in the abscissa in ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) shows the temperature dependence of the resistivity measured within the @xmath24-plane using a common four probe method and ( b ) shows the magnetization at 5  k under the magnetic field of 500  oe after field cooling . </S>",
    "<S> all films had metallic ground state and the insulator to metal ( i - m ) transition temperature ( @xmath25 ) was continuously shifted to lower temperatures from the lsmo to the nsmo film . </S>",
    "<S> however , the magnetic property exhibited a dramatic variation with the lattice constant ratio @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the lsmo film had ferromagnetic transition at 325  k and the magnetization was about 3.2  @xmath27 in the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath26 is reduced , the magnetization decreased ; for the nsmo film , the magnetization was only about 0.26  @xmath27 and did nt saturate even at 50 koe . </S>",
    "<S> the small spontaneous magnetization in spite of in - plane metallic conductivity signals the a - af ordering . </S>",
    "<S> however one might still argue that the small magnetization and the metallic conduction are the result of the phase separation rather than the a - af ordering : small fraction of ferromagnetic metallic region is embedded in antiferromagnetic insulator . in order to differentiate the two possibilities we measured the transport across a nsmo film .    </S>",
    "<S> a nsmo film was deposited on 5% la - doped srtio@xmath1 ( la - sto ) , which is a good conductor . by x - ray diffraction and @xmath28-@xmath29 and @xmath28-@xmath30 curves </S>",
    "<S> , we confirmed that it had the same lattice constant and magnetic properties as those of the nsmo film grown on sto . </S>",
    "<S> the film was etched to form two @xmath31 m square pads separated by a 10  @xmath32 m gap using photolithography technique ( see the inset of ) . </S>",
    "<S> because the substrate is highly conductive , the resistivity was estimated as that coming from two 70  nm thin film resistors in series . </S>",
    "<S> we show in the result of temperature dependence of out - of - plane resistivity of the nsmo / la - sto film measured under the magnetic field of 0 and 50  koe respectively applied parallel to the @xmath24-plane . </S>",
    "<S> the large out - of - plane resistivity could be partly due to the insulating layer formation at the interface , which contributes to the overall offset of the resistivity . </S>",
    "<S> however , the interfacial layer is inactive electronically in general and does not respond to the magnetic field in particular  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the appearance of the out - of - plane magnetoresistance around 200  k ( ( b ) ) concomitant with the in - plane i - m transition in ( a ) , which persists down to low temperatures , signifies the a - af - type order inside the film . </S>",
    "<S> the negative magnetoresistance is brought about by the canting of the out - of - plane antiparallel spin order . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour is consistent with the observations in the bulk crystals  @xcite . for a phase separated film </S>",
    "<S> , the magnetoresistance should peak around the curie temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> while the magnetotransport measurement showed the evidence of ferro - type orbital ordering in nsmo , the lsmo film should have more isotropic orbital distribution judged from the 3d fm behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> thus we have samples with varing degree of orbital polarization and a range of @xmath26 values , which allow us to differentiate the two mechanisms .    in the previous rxs measurements used for antiferro - type orbital ordering in manganites , </S>",
    "<S> the incident beam is @xmath33-polarized and only the @xmath34-polarized scattering beam is detected at a superlattice position . in the present case , </S>",
    "<S> however , the diffraction spots from the ferro - type orbital ordering and/or the jahn - teller distortion coincide with the bragg peaks . </S>",
    "<S> thus the quite large @xmath35 bragg scattering masks the @xmath36 scattering due to the anisotropic scattering factor of mn atoms , the information we are after . to circumvent the difficulty , an interference technique was devised  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the new technique is a method to extract an interference term between @xmath35 scattering and @xmath36 scattering . </S>",
    "<S> consider a geometry in which the analyzer crystal is deliberately rotated by @xmath37 from the angle at which only the @xmath34-polarized beam can pass . </S>",
    "<S> there is a small projection of @xmath35 scattering onto the analyzer which can interfere with the projection of @xmath36 scattering . </S>",
    "<S> note that bragg scattering from incident @xmath38-polarized x - ray @xmath39 is negligible because the incident x - ray is almost completely @xmath33-polarized . </S>",
    "<S> the interferrence effect is analysed as follows . </S>",
    "<S> the atomic scattering factor of mn atom is given by @xmath40 where a uniaxial symmetry is assumed and the @xmath41-axis is taken along the @xmath15-axis of the film . both @xmath42 and @xmath43 contain contribution from resonant and non - resonant processes but the difference @xmath44 contains the resonant scattering only . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering amplitude @xmath46 of @xmath47 scattering is given by @xmath48 and that of @xmath36 scattering , @xmath49 , is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the angle between the @xmath15-axis of the film and the scattering vector , @xmath52 the scattering angle , @xmath53 the azimuthal angle  @xcite . the structure factor due to all atoms other than mn , @xmath54 , </S>",
    "<S> was calculated using the known atomic scattering factors and assuming cubic symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> note that mn atom was put at the center of a unit cell when calculating the structure factor , so the phase factor of mn atom equal unity . </S>",
    "<S> when the analyzer is set at an angle @xmath55 from the @xmath35 channel , the scattering intensity is given by @xmath56 by taking the difference between the intensities at two symmetrically located @xmath55 s , we obtain @xmath57\\sin^{2}2\\theta_{a}\\sin 2\\delta_{\\varphi}.\\ ] ] in our measurement , @xmath58 and @xmath37 was set at @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> the interference term can be approximated to the first order of @xmath60 as , @xmath61\\sim re[(f_{hkl}+f_{a})\\cdot\\delta f^{*}]\\label{eq:6}.\\ ] ]    shows the energy dependence of the normalized intensity of the interference term at azimuthal angle @xmath62 at room temperature for nsmo film . </S>",
    "<S> the error bar indicates one standard deviation . </S>",
    "<S> the data are fitted using equation  ( [ eq:6 ] ) , in which the energy dependence of @xmath60 dominates over that of @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath60 is expressed as @xmath64 where , @xmath65 is the fitting parameter . since @xmath66 , the shape of the interference spectrum </S>",
    "<S> is predetermined by the derivative @xmath67 and the fitting is sensitive only to the depth of the dip </S>",
    "<S> . therefore the error bar of the data directly translates into the error bar in the fitting parameter ( shown in below ) . in the fitting procedure , </S>",
    "<S> the atomic scattering factor @xmath68 of mn atom was deduced from the kramers - kronig transformation of the absorption spectrum and approximated to be equal to @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath68 was numerically differentiated to arrive at @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> we determined @xmath69  ev for the nsmo film . </S>",
    "<S> the azimuthal dependence of the interference intensity is shown in the inset of with a satisfactory fit again with @xmath70  ev . </S>",
    "<S> the relation of the energy levels is @xmath71 in coulomb mechanism and @xmath72 in jahn - teller mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the result @xmath73 implies that the jahn - teller effect is stronger . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the energy split for lsmo and psmo at room temperature were also estimated in a similar way . </S>",
    "<S> shows the relation between @xmath26 and the energy gap . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath74 changes linearly with @xmath26 , although the orbital states of the three samples are expected to be considerably different as will be discussed below .    </S>",
    "<S> we also performed measurement at low temperatures with a closed - cycle he refrigerator for the nsmo film . </S>",
    "<S> the nsmo film has the transition from paramagnetic to a - af ordering at 220  k ( @xmath75 ) , which promotes the shift of the orbital state to the @xmath18 orbital , through the spin - orbit interaction . </S>",
    "<S> however , as is shown in , no noticeable change in @xmath76 was found above and below ( at 150  k ) @xmath75 , indicating that the effect of coulomb mechanism is very small .    </S>",
    "<S> detailed first - principle band structure calculations are available to estimate the occupancy of the @xmath17 orbitals ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) as a function of the @xmath26 ratio and the spin state  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> application of the results of the calculations to the samples in the current experiment leads to the following estimates for the orbital polarization defined as @xmath79 for a fixed total occupancy of 0.6 ; ( i ) @xmath80 for @xmath81 and a - af phase ( the case of the nsmo at 150  k ) and ( ii ) @xmath82 for @xmath83 and ferromagnetic phase ( lsmo at room temperature ) . </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that the observed splitting @xmath74 is the sum of the contribution from the jahn - teller mechanism ( @xmath84 : proportional to the magnitude of the lattice distortion , or @xmath85 ) and that from the coulomb mechanism ( @xmath86 : proportional to @xmath87 ) ; @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> two data points in for lsmo and nsmo at 150  k then lead to two simultaneous linear equations with two unknowns , @xmath84 and @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath89 allowed within the error bars of the two data points . </S>",
    "<S> the negative value is of course non - physical . </S>",
    "<S> the worst possible value + 0.27 corresponds to the case in which @xmath74 values at two opposite ends of the error bars ( indicated by arrows in ) are used ; a highly unlikely situation . </S>",
    "<S> thus the above estimates must be quite conservative . </S>",
    "<S> the fairly good fit of the line that passes through @xmath90 at @xmath91 irrespective of the orbital states attests the smallness of the coulomb contribution  @xcite .    in conclusion , we investigated the mechanism of rxs with use of @xmath10sr@xmath11mno@xmath1 thin films epitaxially grown on srtio@xmath1 substrates . </S>",
    "<S> the samples cover a wide range of orbital states , to which the results of rxs are quite insensitive . </S>",
    "<S> the upper limit of 0.27 is estimated for the relative contributions of the coulomb and the jahn - teller mechanisms .    </S>",
    "<S> the authors thank y. murakami , h. nakao , and m. kubota for assistance in the course of the rxs measurements and for fruitful discussions . </S>",
    "<S> we are also grateful to z. fang for providing us with the data for calculation . </S>",
    "<S> the work was supported in part by a grand - in - aid for coe research from the mext of japan . </S>"
