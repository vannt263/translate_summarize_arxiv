    "the advances in technology stimulate a renewed theoretical interest to the properties of one dimensional ( 1d ) quantum wires .",
    "the practical implementations of such systems include carbon nanotubes , chains of metal atoms or weakly side - coupled molecular chains in solids . a new class of materials is given by two - dimensional topological insulators ( tis ) , whose edge states are ideal quantum wires  @xcite .",
    "this paper discusses the transport via the junction between these edge states and its renormalization by interactions .",
    "the transport properties of 1d wires has been theoretically studied since early 1990s in terms of luttinger liquid and within bosonization formalism @xcite .",
    "it was found that the interaction between fermions renormalizes the impurity scattering , so that for repulsive interaction the conductivity of the wire tends to zero in the limit of low temperatures , even for one impurity .",
    "the bosonization approach considers the interaction in the bulk of the wire exactly , while the impurity is regarded as perturbation . in more sophisticated theories the impurity",
    "is considered as certain boundary conditions for the bulk fields , and the approach is generalized for the case of junctions between several wires @xcite .",
    "alternative description using more traditional fermionic approach and s - matrix formalism was developed in @xcite for case of one impurity , this approach was later generalized to the case of junctions of several wires @xcite .",
    "it was found that the renormalization of s - matrix by interaction is described in terms of renormalization group equations , which eventually defined the scaling exponents of the conductance behavior .",
    "the initial formulation of the fermionic s - matrix approach assumed that the bulk interaction was considered only in the lowest order , and this might be regarded as some disadvantage in comparison with bosonization . in certain cases the lowest order calculation was insufficient , and the calculation of next - order corrections to s - matrix was required @xcite    it was found , however , that the s - matrix approach could be essentially improved by summation of simple diagrammatic series in perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the result of this summation was the modification of the rg equations for s - matrix , so that the scaling exponents found in limiting fixed points ( fps ) of these equations coincided with those established by bosonization .",
    "at the same time the s - matrix approach has an advantage over bosonizaton in providing full scaling curves for the conductances .",
    "the method was tested for junctions of two leads @xcite , three - lead junctions @xcite , also for non - equilibrium @xcite .",
    "generalization of this approach for the case of infinite luttinger liquid wires was undertaken in @xcite .",
    "it was recently shown that the case of a junction connecting four quantum wires , which is generally characterized by s - matrix belonging to @xmath0 group , might be principally different in the form of rg equation , even in the lowest order of interaction .",
    "@xcite this difference from the simpler cases of junctions of two and three wires shows itself in the discrete @xmath1 ambiguity in the parametrization of s - matrix , which is unobservable in terms of conductances of the junction .",
    "this `` hidden phase '' is known to happen in @xmath2 groups at @xmath3 , and it may indicate that the bosonization description becomes inadequate already for four wires .    in this paper",
    "we continue our studies of junctions of four quantum wires .",
    "first we analyze the renormalization of corner junction between the 1d helical edge states of topological insulators , earlier discussed in @xcite .",
    "the work by teo and kane @xcite allows the direct comparison with our analysis here , as they provide the second - order rg analysis for s - matrix , in addition to the bosonization treatment .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that the time - reversal symmetry determines the specific structure of the s - matrix , in particular the absence of backscattering in the same edge state .",
    "we extend the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite by summing the perturbation series in bulk interaction and arrive to non - perturbative rg equations for conductances , whose fps and scaling exponents are in exact correspondence with bosonization results , where available .",
    "the above problem of `` hidden '' phase in @xmath0 is absent in case of helical edge states due to the symmetry of s - matrix , reducible to the symplectic form .",
    "next we analyze the generalization of the above setup by considering different interaction strength in the helical edge states , whereas the form of the s - matrix remains the same due to symmetry .",
    "the phase portrait in this case is characterized by two phases ; the new phase as compared to the previous case appears for interaction strength of different signs , when some fps disappear or change their character .",
    "we show that if the x - junction is characterized by the `` bare '' s - matrix close to one of fps of saddle point type , then the temperature evolution reveals the non - monotonic behavior of conductances , similarly to the case of y - junction considered in @xcite .",
    "we further notice that the case of electron tunneling from a spinful luttinger liquid wire tip to helical edge state can be described by the same s - matrix , but different matrix of bulk interactions .",
    "this physically important setup was not considered previously and it is different from the tunneling from fully spin - polarized tip to the helical edge state @xcite , the latter situation described in terms of three - lead y - junction . the different form of the interaction matrix leads to slightly modified derivation of rg equation , but otherwise our approach remains the same . as a result",
    ", we obtain the phase portrait describing the tunneling from the spinful wire to the helical edge state .",
    "we find only one fixed point , corresponding to the absence of tunneling .",
    "in addition , we demonstrate one or two fixed lines of conductances , depending on the interaction .",
    "the rg fixed lines in the plane of conductances was found earlier for chiral y - junctions at certain values of the interaction strength .",

    "we consider the two - channel tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) model with a local scatterer of arbitrary strength in the middle of the wire .",
    "in particular , such model incorporates a model of spinful electrons , scattering on a local potential and a model of corner junction between the helical edge states of topological insulators .    as in our previous papers , we assume that the short - range interaction between the fermions is of the forward scattering type and takes place in wires of finite length @xmath4 , contacted by reservoirs . the adiabatic transition from wire to reservoir produces no additional potential scattering .",
