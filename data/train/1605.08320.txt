    "we represent the discs as a vector @xmath0 , where each disc has three coordinates representing the center of mass @xmath1 and the overall internal rotation @xmath2 relative to a fixed , external coordinate system .",
    "we will call @xmath3 the `` position '' variables because they describe the discs overall positions in space , and we will call @xmath4 the `` spin '' variables because they describe how much each disc has internally rotated , or spun about an axis , like a gear fixed in place . the spin variables are the ones that are usually not accessible by macroscopic measurements . all vectors in this paper are column vectors , though we write them inline for readability .",
    "the discs are identical with unit diameters , and pairs @xmath5 and @xmath6 are in contact . for each such pair @xmath7",
    "there are two possible constraints : one requires the discs to be a fixed distance apart so they are exactly touching , and another requires the points in contact to move with the same relative velocity .",
    "these each imply a constraint on the velocities ( not momenta ) , as @xmath8 we write @xmath9 .",
    "the second constraint comes from noting the velocity on disc @xmath10 of the point in contact with disc @xmath11 is @xmath12 , and considering the component of relative velocity that is perpendicular to @xmath13 , since the component parallel to it is accounted for by the first constraint .",
    "we call the `` bond constraints '' and the `` rolling constraints . ''",
    "in addition , we constrain the center of mass to the origin . the complete set of constraints can be written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a matrix whose rows are the coefficients multiplying velocities in , . here",
    "@xmath16 is the number of constraints , and @xmath17 is the number of configuration space variables .",
    "we suppose the potential energy of the system is a smooth function @xmath18 , and the discs are immersed in a fluid or other medium that provides a white noise forcing to the momentum and a viscous damping that is linear in velocity .",
    "we use the langevin equations to model the dynamics , and assume the friction tensor @xmath19 and forcing tensor @xmath20 satisfy a fluctuation - dissipation relation @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the inverse of temperature @xmath23 times the boltzmann constant .",
    "this ensures that the invariant measure for the unconstrained system is the boltzmann distribution : @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath25 is the mass matrix , which is diagonal with entries equal to either the mass or moment of inertia of a disc .",
    "it should be noted that the langevin equations do not correctly describe the velocity correlations of particles immersed in a fluid , even for large particles , because the correlation times for the particles velocities and for the fluid s momentum fluctuations are of the same magnitude @xcite .",
    "however , they do capture the correct static thermodynamic behavior ( at least without constraints ) , and they do lead to the correct overdamped equations . since our goal is to obtain an overdamped equation which involves restrictions on velocities , and not to correctly describe the velocity correlations induced by hydrodynamic interactions , we proceed with the langevin equations as a starting point from which we can impose velocity constraints via mechanical principles .    to account for constraints ,",
    "we apply dalembert s principle , or the principle of virtual work .",
    "this requires that the constraints do no work in a `` virtual '' move , namely one which holds all variables fixed and takes a step in a tangent direction consistent with the constraints .",
    "the constraints must therefore be imposed by forces perpendicular to the allowable tangent directions , which can be done using lagrange multipliers @xcite . this is the only principle available for arbitrary linear velocity constraints , since variational principles are only valid when the constraints are known to be holonomic @xcite .",
    "the constrained langevin equations are @xmath26 combined with the constraints . in the above , @xmath27 is a @xmath28-dimensional white noise , and @xmath29 are the lagrange multipliers that ensure the constraints are satisfied .",
    "the product @xmath30 can be interpreted in either the it or the stratonovich sense , since @xmath20 does not depend on @xmath31 so it is of bounded variation .",
    "the mass can be removed from the equations by changing to mass - scaled variables ( see appendix [ sec : mass ] , or @xcite ) , so hereafter we set @xmath32 .",
    "this is not a non - dimensionalization , but simply a convenient change of variables , which can be inverted to put the mass back in at any step in the subsequent analysis when desired .",
    "the particles we aim to model have very short correlation times for momentum , so they are effectively modelled by the overdamped langevin equations , which describe the dynamics of the system in configuration space only .",
    "we derive these overdamped equations by considering the limit of large viscous friction and long timescales . in this section",
    "we sketch the results ; the detailed calculations are shown in appendices [ sec : lagrange ] , [ sec : overdamp ] .",
    "first , we write explicitly .",
    "the lagrange multipliers can be computed analytically by taking the time derivative of and substituting for @xmath33 from ( see appendix [ sec : lagrange ] . )",
    "the resulting equations are @xmath34 the matrix @xmath35 is an orthogonal projection onto the complement to the row space of @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the gram matrix of the constraints : @xmath38 here and hereafter @xmath39 is an identity matrix with dimensions correct for the context .",
    "the final term in is a vector with components @xmath40 , and represents the extra acceleration due to the curvature of the constraints .",
    "this shows the constrained dynamics are given by projecting the original momentum equation onto the subspace of allowed , unconstrained directions , plus a curvature - driven acceleration term @xcite .",
    "again it does nt matter if the projected force @xmath41 is interpreted in the it or stratonovich sense because @xmath42 is of bounded variation .",
    "next , we consider the overdamped limit by letting @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and performing formal homogenization on the generator of @xcite .",
    "this is a standard technique to obtain the overdamped langevin equations asymptotically ; the novelty here is the arbitrary linear velocity constraints .",
    "the result is weakly equivalent to the stochastic process @xmath45 that solves the it equation ( see appendix [ sec : overdamp ] for details ) @xmath46 here @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is its moore - penrose pseudoinverse matrix @xmath49 , the moore - penrose pseudoinverse @xmath50 is the unique matrix which satisfies ( i ) @xmath51 , ( ii ) @xmath52 , ( iii ) @xmath53 , and ( iv ) @xmath54 . ]",
    "( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the matrix @xmath55 is any matrix such that @xmath56 .    to highlight the fundamental ideas we will analyze in the simplest possible setup : constant friction and no long - range potential energy , so @xmath57 and @xmath58 . in this case @xmath59 , so after a change of time scale @xmath60 becomes @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes the stratonovich product .",
    "the process @xmath45 looks locally like a brownian motion that can only move in a subspace of its ambient space .",
    "this process is well - understood mathematically when the velocity constraints are holonomic , meaning they imply an equal number of constraints in configuration space , i.e. on the variables contained in @xmath42 . in this case",
    "the process is constrained to remain on a manifold @xmath63 in configuration space , whose dimension equals the rank of @xmath35 ( which is an orthogonal projection matrix onto the tangent space to @xmath63 at each point @xmath42 . )",
    "the process is actually a brownian motion on @xmath63 , which is by definition a process whose generator is the laplace - beltrami operator on @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "briefly , to see why , note that the generator of is @xmath64 where @xmath65 for matrices @xmath66 , and @xmath67 applied to a vector expands each element into a row so that @xmath68 . here",
    "@xmath69 may be thought of as a function on @xmath63 , even though the gradient operator in @xmath70 acts on all directions in the ambient space .",
    "then , @xmath71 can be shown to equal @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the gradient operator on @xmath63 , and @xmath74 can be shown to equal @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the divergence operator on @xmath63 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore for holonomic constraints @xmath77 , which is the laplace - beltrami operator on @xmath63 .    for non - holonomic constraints there is no similarly canonical interpretation of @xmath70 of the form at the present time , as we discuss briefly in the conclusion .    for discs ,",
    "the bond constraints are holonomic since they imply the distances between pairs in contact are conserved , which is a constraint in configuration space .",
    "the constraints on the center of mass are also holonomic .",
    "the rolling constraints are not immediately seen to be holonomic , since they can not be integrated in time directly .",
    "although one can show they are indeed holonomic as we discuss briefly in section [ sec : hardsoft ] and appendix [ sec : geometry ] , we will proceed without this knowledge , to show that one can still work with without knowing the geometric structure of the constraints .",
    "next we ask what is the equilibrium distribution for a trimer in position space both with , and without , the rolling constraints .",
    "we will show these have densities proportional to , respectively,@xmath78 where @xmath79 is the internal angle of the trimer .",
    "the domain is @xmath80 $ ] if the spheres can not interpenetrate , and @xmath81 $ ] if they can ( as is allowed in simulations . )",
    "these calculations are performed for the simplest setup described by , but we expect them to be valid in more general settings ( with a suitable modification to account for the potential energy @xmath18 . )    figure [ fig : probs ] plots the two distributions .",
    "the rolling constraints favour more open configurations than purely bond constraints .",
    "this figure also plots the empirical histograms obtained by numerically simulating the langevin equations directly ( see appendix [ sec : numerics ] for methods ) ; the agreement verifies our calculations .",
    "the small discrepancies are thought to arise partly from statistical fluctuations , and , in the case of rolling constraints , because the numerical method does not conserve the additional implied constraints in configuration space ( see appendix [ sec : geometry ] . )",
    "the distributions above are for `` hard '' constraints , i.e. the constraints are satisfied exactly . in a physical system constraints",
    "are often an approximation for a concentration of probability near a lower - dimensional manifold , but the system can wiggle around near this : the constraints are `` soft '' .",
    "this happens , for example , when constraints of the form @xmath82 ( where @xmath10 indexes the constraints ) are imposed by a stiff potential energy , such as @xmath83 with @xmath84 .",
    "this wiggle room changes the equilibrium density , and in the limit of infinite stiffness it is not the same as imposing hard constraints ; this is the well - known `` paradox '' of hard versus soft constraints in statistical mechanics that has been discussed many times in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the distributions for infinitely stiff soft constraints can be obtained from those for hard ones and we will show they are @xmath85 these are the distributions one would typically compare to experimentally ; for example similarly obtained distributions accurately predict the equilibrium probabilities of colloidal clusters @xcite .",
    "the distribution when discs can slide is constant ( see figure [ fig : probs ] ) , as one would expect since each outer disc should be uniformly distributed on the surface of the central disc .      in this section",
    "we show , explicitly .",
    "this section is technical and not essential to understanding the subsequent discussion .",
    "our strategy will be to parameterize the position degrees of freedom of the cluster explicitly to remove the bond and center of mass constraints , write the equations in these variables , and finally solve the fokker - planck equation by direct calculation .",
    "this is a brute - force approach yet it still gives insight into the geometry and mechanics of the constraints , by explicitly identifying the linear subspaces involved in setting the dynamics .",
    "let @xmath86 $ ] ( or @xmath87 $ ] ) be half the internal angle , measured underneath the line 1 - 2 - 3 when disc 2 has been rotated to lie on the @xmath88-axis , and let @xmath89 $ ] be the overall rotation of the cluster .",
    "see figure [ fig : trimer ] for an illustration .",
    "let the position variables be @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 is a @xmath93 block diagonal matrix , whose blocks are @xmath94 matrices that rotate each point @xmath95 by an angle @xmath96 about the origin .. ] the full cluster is parameterized by @xmath97 this preserves the bond and center of mass constraints so they can be removed from the rows of @xmath36 which form the projection @xmath98 .",
    "we now perform this change of variables in , to write the dynamics in terms of the new variables @xmath99 .",
    "let @xmath100 be the position variables and let @xmath101 be the spin variables .",
    "let us define the following matrices : @xmath102 here @xmath103 is the matrix of zeros with appropriate dimensions , and the diagonal elements of @xmath104 are @xmath105 note that @xmath106 is the two - dimensional moment of inertia of the cluster",

    "separately gives @xmath114 here @xmath115 is the same white noise for each .",
    "notice that equation for the position variables does not depend on @xmath2 , because @xmath116 are independent of @xmath2 .",
    "( the spin variables , however , do depend on the positions . )",
    "therefore we can analyze it independently , to compute the equilibrium distribution in these variables only .",
    "first consider the equilibrium density for _ without _ the rolling constraints , so that @xmath117 .",
    "one strategy would be to compute the matrix elements in directly and solve the stationary fokker - planck equation , as we will do when rolling constraints are included .",
    "however , it is simpler to proceed geometrically , and recognize that , based on and the subsequent discussion , is a parameterized version of a brownian motion on a manifold .",
    "( note that @xmath118 has zeros in the entries corresponding to the spin variables so these components of @xmath119 do not contribute . )",
    "this manifold ( call it @xmath120 ) is the set of accessible configurations in position space when internal rotations are ignored .",
    "it can be embedded in the full configuration space by setting the spin variables to fixed constants , for example as @xmath121 . this embedding respects the inner product inherited from the ambient space , so the columns of @xmath118 form a basis for tangent vectors to @xmath120 and @xmath104 is the metric tensor on @xmath120 in the variables @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium density is the surface measure on @xmath120 , which in these variables is @xmath123 .",
    "result follows from , , .",
    "next consider the invariant measure _ with _ the rolling constraints .",

    "are obtained as follows : @xmath138 is the motion obtained by fixing the positions of the discs and only letting them spin ; we call this `` pure spinning . '' for @xmath139 we prescribe the first six components to be @xmath140 , and solve the two linear equations for @xmath141 .",
    "there is a one - parameter family of solutions @xmath142 .",
    "we choose the one which minimizes @xmath143 , or equivalently which is perpendicular to @xmath138 .",
    "for @xmath144 we similarly fix the first six components to be @xmath145 and solve for @xmath141 .",
    "the solutions are @xmath146 , and we choose the one with minimum @xmath147-norm .",
    "each set of solutions for @xmath141 has physical meaning since they tell us how the discs must spin , like gears , to produce a desired motion of the cluster in position space .",
    "they are each equal to a fixed combination of spins ( @xmath148 to change the internal angle , and @xmath149 to rotate the cluster overall ) , plus an arbitrary multiple of the pure spinning motion @xmath138 .",
    "we project each column of @xmath118 using to find @xmath150 , @xmath151 , so @xmath152 from this , computing the @xmath153 , @xmath154 in is a matter of algebra .",
    "we eventually write as @xmath155 where @xmath156 denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath132 , and @xmath157 a solution that is independent of @xmath96 is @xmath158 .",
    "one can check this satisfies the boundary conditions , so holds , as claimed .      given constraints of the form @xmath82 ( where @xmath10 indexes the constraints ) which are imposed by a stiff potential energy , such as @xmath83 with @xmath84",
    ", we can obtain the distribution for infinitely stiff soft constraints from that for hard ones .",
    "this is done by multiplying the distribution for hard constraints by a factor of @xmath159 , where @xmath49 is the gram matrix of @xmath160 evaluated at @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "if we assume the bond - distance constraints are imposed softly by spring - like forces so that @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 , then one can calculate using that @xmath164 . including this factor in shows the probabilities including these vibrational modes are given by .    to impose the rolling constraints softly , they must be holonomic , meaning they imply two additional constraints in configuration space only .",
    "this is the case when the rows of @xmath36 are each a perfect gradient , but it can also hold when some nonlinear combinations of the rows are . it turns out that although each individual rolling constraint is not a perfect gradient , they are still holonomic after multiplying by a suitable integrating factor ( appendix , section [ sec : geometry ] . ) therefore , with knowledge of these additional constraints one could write down the equilibrium density @xmath165 immediately in the same way we did for @xmath166",
    ". such an approach may be able to consider larger , more general collections of discs .",
    "we do not attempt to impose the rolling constraints softly here , for at least two reasons .",
    "one , because it is not clear whether the additional conserved quantities in configuration space come from a stiff potential that is the origin of the friction force , or whether they are accidents of our two - dimensional geometry ; this probably depends on the details of how the friction comes about .",
    "two , because there are infinitely many functions @xmath167 which have the same level set and we currently have no physical principle with which to choose one .",
    "it is surprising that the equilibrium distributions for the trimer with and without rolling constraints are different , since according to classical statistical mechanics , if there is no external force on a system then each outer disc should be uniformly distributed on the central one , so the internal angle distribution is flat as for @xmath166 in .",
    "what then are we to make of this result ?",
    "two interpretations are suggested here .",
    "first , one can take this example as a lesson in imposing constraints in a statistical mechanical system , even when these constraints are effective models for mechanical systems and the forces that impose the constraints are derived in an analogous manner to the mechanical system .",
    "similar to the much - discussed difference between hard and soft constraints in configuration space , one must even be careful when imposing constraints on velocities , seemingly innocuous because it is not immediately obvious that these should affect distributions in configuration space .    nevertheless , it is often useful to model systems using constraints  it removes fast , often unnecessary degrees of freedom , and also reduces the dimensionality , making numerical and analytical descriptions more tractable ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in this first interpretation where we assume",
    "the classical statistical mechanical result holds , then this would imply a sort of `` roughness '' entropy associated with the velocity constraint , which would provide an additional force that would counteract the effect of the constraint and keep the equilibrium angle distribution constant .",
    "such a roughness entropy would be similar in spirit to a vibrational entropy , but different in form because it should not necessarily be possible to obtain it as a harmonic expansion of a function of variables in configuration space only .",
    "indeed , the constraint which models a sphere rolling on a plane is nonholonomic @xcite , so any jiggling about the constraint can not depend only on the location and overall rotation of the sphere . even for a pair of discs",
    ", one may wish to allow irreversible , nonharmonic slippage about their points of contact .    to see why this suggestion is plausible , imagine the following : three gears on a slippery plane , subject to stochastic fluctuations ( such as by vibrations , or fluctuations from the surrounding medium ) , whose",
    "centers are bound by elastic spring forces as for the trimer .",
    "the gears must roll in order to change their internal angle because the teeth are long and the spring forces strong .",
    "the teeth of the gears must have small gaps between them if the setup is to have non - zero probability , and the tangential rattling of the gears within these gaps could provide the conjectured roughness entropy in the limit as the teeth becomes smaller and closer together .",
    "a similar argument would hold for particles with rough surfaces , where asperities may interlock like gears with randomly - spaced teeth .",
    "the jiggling of the discs about their points of contact are coupled to the configuration space variables , since depending on the configuration ( the angle of the trimer ) there could be larger or smaller infinitesimal displacements available .",
    "an intriguing possibility is that this collective jiggling could result in a roughness entropy that causes the angle distribution to deviate from a constant , or even the distribution with rolling constraints derived in this paper , since even in a classical equilibrium system it could be the case that the limiting entropy depends on the way in which the limit is obtained , i.e. whether one considers regularly spaced identical gear teeth , randomly spaced teeth with random heights , or some other pattern .",
    "the author is not aware of results showing the free energy of a collection of hard particles is a continuous function of their shape .",
    "second , and perhaps more interestingly , is the literal interpretation of the result , which would imply that particles interacting with friction that creates rolling , have different free energies than those without .",
    "this is only possible if friction causes the system to deviate from classical statistical mechanics , which is possible if it involves non - conservative forces or kinetic effects .",
    "dry friction is known to be a complicated , time - dependent , non - equilibrium phenomenon @xcite that takes energy and dissipates it into heat or sound , via processes ranging from , among others , van der waals interactions , capillary bridges , covalent bonds , plastic and elastic deformations of the bodies , fracture , wear , and quantum mechanical interactions ; it is remarkable that it is so well modeled by the coulomb interaction law across a vast range of scales @xcite . yet",
    "this coulomb interaction law involves an intrinsically nonlinear response to applied forcing and therefore is difficult to reconcile with the conditions of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "it is not so implausible that such a dissipative force could cause a system of particles to deviate from the predictions of classical statistical mechanics ; indeed such deviations are observed in the widely - studied area of active particles , where active forcing due to internal motors , chemotaxis , external magnetic fields , and such forces push a system out of equilibrium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an active component might even be able to create a dissipative force that mimics the effects of rolling .",
    "for example , a popular method to create a reversible interaction between colloids is to coat them with strands of sticky dna , which acts like velcro when the colloids are close enough .",
    "certain kinds of dna must consume fuel in order to create an effective colloid - colloid interaction , which pushes the system out of equilibrium , and could arguably cause the colloids to roll preferentially @xcite .",
    "relatedly , colloidal particles of many different kinds are being synthesized and simulated where rotational degrees of freedom are actively forced , including particles that actively rotate @xcite and look like gears @xcite , for which this study may provide fundamental and preliminary intuition into a system with a rich and not very well understood phase space .",
    "if does describe the equilibrium angle distribution of a collection of particles interacting with very strong dry friction or other similar nonequilibrium dissipative forces , then it provides a method determine experimentally whether friction is present for a certain type of particle : one can construct a trimer that stays connected for long enough to generate sufficient statistics of the internal angle , and then compare the distributions . for example , the probability of a rolling cluster having angle greater than @xmath168 ( where the two densities cross ) is 0.48 , while that for a sliding cluster is 0.45 ; measuring @xmath169 could be one way to compare the distributions .",
    "conversely , given a system where strong friction is present , measuring the angle distribution of a trimer ( or other cluster of discs or spheres ) could be one way to verify whether friction changes its free energy .",
    "it is worth noting that gears have been used as the basis for mechanical metamaterials @xcite , and if these systems are made on smaller scales where thermal effects are relevant , then they could be used to test ( or possibly implement ) the predictions in this paper , at least for certain kinds of classically - imposed velocity constraints .      even at the mathematical level",
    ", it is perhaps surprising that the equilibrium distributions for sliding and rolling discs are different , since rolling constraints do not change the accessible configurations in position space .",
    "some insight into the mathematical reason for why comes from imagining how the constraints alter the amount of white - noise forcing that is projected onto the position variables , producing observable motion .",
    "the white noise acts equally in all directions in the subspace spanned by the columns of @xmath35 , but the forcing we observe in the position variables depends on the projection of the noise to the subspace @xmath170 .",
    "the magnitude of this observed forcing depends on the angles between the two subspaces , which varies with @xmath42 .",
    "a stochastic process with no drift spends more time in regions where it diffuses more slowly , so the equilibrium distribution changes accordingly .    as a side note",
    ", we can determine the specific magnitude of this projection from the calculations in section [ sec : derivation ] .",
    "the subspace spanned by the columns of @xmath35 has an orthonormal basis contained in the columns of @xmath171 , where the vectors @xmath172 are defined in .",
    "the subspace @xmath120 where only position variables vary has an orthonormal basis contained in the columns of @xmath173 , where @xmath174 are defined in and @xmath175 are defined in , .",
    "the element of area on one subspace changes magnitude when projected to the other subspace by an amount equal to @xmath176 @xcite , where the determinant applied to a rectangular matrix is the product of its singular values .",
    "we can calculate this determinant to be @xmath177 , which is consistent with the equilibrium distribution and also reminiscent of .",
    "physically , these calculations tell us how much forcing is absorbed by the spinning of the gears , and how much produces observable motion in the internal angle @xmath79 or the overall rotation @xmath96 .",
    "for example , consider how the cluster might change the angle @xmath132 by some small amount @xmath178 .",
    "this requires a change in positions with magnitude @xmath179 .",
    "when discs can slide , all the white noise forcing may be applied to change the angle so the timescale for this change to happen is roughly @xmath180 . however",
    ", if the discs must roll , then shows that it takes a constant amount of spinning to change the angle by some small amount @xmath178",
    ". this spinning has magnitude @xmath181 so it absorbs a constant amount of forcing , producing a timescale of @xmath182 .",
    "the difference with the sliding case arises because to change @xmath132 , the gears must spin in a way that is not proportional to how much they move in position space .",
    "we have derived a set of overdamped langevin equations for systems with linear velocity constraints .",
    "we applied this to a trimer of discs whose internal angle can change , and derived the equilibrium distribution in two cases : one where the discs can slide against each other , the other where they must roll .",
    "the two distributions are different , which shows that rolling dynamics modeled as velocity constraints can change even such basic things as the free energy of a system .    whether this model is physically valid depends on the details of how the friction force imposing the velocity constraint arises , a question we do not attempt to answer here since dry friction is a complicated and not fully understood phenomenon . for it to create the demonstrated free energy difference",
    ", the friction must be a nonequilibrium force , to push the system away from the classical boltzmann equilibrium . regardless of whether or not it is",
    ", this example is a useful lesson in modeling statistical mechanical systems by imposing constraints : even if the constraints act on the velocities , they can still have a fundamental effect on positions .",
    "we discussed how in a classical system in equilibrium , we would expect the distributions with and without rolling constraints to be the same , and conjectured that there may be a form of entropy , a `` roughness '' entropy , associated with the rolling constraints which models the infinitesimal jiggling and slippage of the discs about their points of contact as they roll around each other",
    ". such an entropy would be similar in spirit to a vibrational entropy but structurally different , since it would be associated with the dynamical degrees of freedom and not purely with the locational ones .",
    "we suggested ways to test the predictions of this model via experiments on clusters of colloidal particles , or with a system of gears on a vibrating table , where macroscale measurements like the internal configuration of a cluster may help determine microscale interactions . experiments that measure the effect of friction on the steady - state properties in any system with stochastic fluctuations would be valuable , because it is clear we do not have an adequate understanding of this phenomenon which is becoming increasingly important in soft - matter and other mesoscale systems .",
    "our model has also suggested problems where new mathematical developments could help shed light on physical systems .",
    "our derivation of the overdamped langevin equations is valid for arbitrary linear velocity constraints , both holonomic and nonholonomic . in the former case",
    "the overdamped equations describe a brownian motion on a manifold , whose equilibrium distribution is the surface measure on the manifold , but in the latter there is no such interpretation . while it turns out that discs in the plane are holonomic , a cluster of spheres should be nonholonomic : it can access a space that is higher - dimensional than the space along which it is constrained to move",
    ". this should be true because a single sphere rolling on a plane is non - holonomic @xcite .",
    "geometrically , it lives on a sub - riemannian manifold @xcite , an object which has been little studied in the physics literature . in this case",
    "there is no general method to determine the equilibrium distribution of , since there is no canonical volume form ( surface measure ) on a sub - riemannian manifold @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to even identify a laplacian , since it is not clear which volume form to use to define the divergence operator , though some recent progress has been made in comparing different choices @xcite .",
    "one could probably work out the equilibrium distribution for individual cases directly as we have done in this paper , but the delicacy of parameterizing @xmath183 requires separate treatment . extending this study to spheres would not only potentially provide an experimental method to determine whether friction is present , but would also bring insight into the physics of stochastic , nonholonomic systems , which have rarely been considered .",
