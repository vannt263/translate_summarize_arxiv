    "it has been observed that people addicted to watching streaming videos constitute more than half of the internet traffic . with the introduction of smartphones",
    ", mobile networks are witnessing an exponential traffic growth every year .",
    "this leads to scenario where internet and wireless networks are pushed to operate close to their performance limits , dictated by current architectural considerations .",
    "though much effort has been expended and in turn significant progress has been made in recent years to increase the capacity of mobile networks , there is little progress on dealing with the user satisfaction , which is strongly related to the quality of experience ( qoe ) .",
    "this is the big challenge that the operators face today because they have to look at both the server side and the client side to make a link between the quality of service ( qos ) of the network and the client satisfaction which depends on the qoe .",
    "empirical studies in @xcite has identified critical metrics that affect the qoe through the user engagement :    * starvation probability . denoting the probability that a streaming user sees frozen images . *",
    "average bit - rate . denoting the mean video quality over the entire session .",
    "* bit - rate stability . describing the jittering of video quality during the entire session .",
    "* start - up delay . denoting the waiting duration between the time that the user requests streaming service and the time that media player starts to play .",
    "paper @xcite pointed out that the buffering ratio is most critical across genres .",
    "for example , 1% increase in buffering reduces 3 minutes for a 90-minutes live video streaming .",
    "@xcite showed that the total time spent rebuffering and the frequency of rebuffering events have substantial impact on qoe . under this context ,",
    "media servers and network operators face a crucial challenge on how to avoid the degradation of user perceived media quality based on these metrics . however , development of new models as function of these metrics can help operators and content publishers to better invest their network and server resources toward optimizing these metrics that really matter for qoe .",
    "in this paper we focus on a setting in which a video is streamed over a wireless network which is subject to a lot of constraints like bandwidth limitation and rate fluctuations due to the frequent changes of channel states and mobility @xcite .",
    "indeed , time varying network capacity is especially relevant when considering wireless networks where such variations can be caused by fast fading and slow fading due to shadowing , dynamic interference , and changing loads . to addresse this issue ,",
    "we focus on performance modelling and analysis of a streaming video with long range dependence ( lrd ) traffic and variable service capacity . due to the inherent difficulty and complexity of modelling fractal - like lrd traffic , we assume that the arrival of packets at player buffer are characterized by a markov modulated fluid model , which accurately approximates the traffic exhibiting lrd behaviour and mimics the real behaviour of multimedia traffic with short - term and long - term correlation @xcite . in comparison to related works ,",
    "our whole analysis is on transient regime .",
    "we construct sets of partial differential equations ( pdes ) to derive the starvation probability generating function using the external environment , which is described by the continuous time markov chain ( ctmc ) .",
    "this approach predicts the starvation probability as function of the file size as well as the prefetching threshold .",
    "moreover we provide relevant results to understand on how the starvation probabilities are impacted by the variation of traffic load and prefetching threshold .",
    "we do simulations to show the accuracy of our model using ns-3 . achieving this goal , we are able to identify through our model the dependencies between quality metrics . for example",
    ", start - up delay can reduce rebuffing ratio .",
    "similarly bitrate rate switching can reduce buffering .    with the results developed in this work , we are able to answer the fundamental questions : how many frames should the media player prefetch to optimize the users quality of experience ? from what file size the adaptive coding is relevant to avoid the starvation ?",
    "how bit - rate switching impacts the qoe metrics ?",
    "knowing these answers enables the user to maximize his qoe realising the tradeoffs among different metrics incorporating user preferences on rebuffering ratio , start - up delay and quality @xcite .",
    "we further introduce an optimization problem which takes these key factors in order to achieve the optimal tradeoff between them .",
    "we adopt a more flexible method by defining an objective of qoe by associated a weight for each metric based on user preferences @xcite .",
    "qoe analysis over wireless networks has been studied for many years . in @xcite , authors study the qoe in a shared fast - fading channel using an analytical framework based on takacs ballot theorem .",
    "they use a gi / d/1 queue to model the system , so they assume that the arrival process is independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the analysis of buffer starvation using m / m/1 queue is performed .",
    "they use a recursive method to compare the results with the ballot theorem method even if the recursive method did not offer explicit results .",
    "they assume an i.i.d arrival process that is a rough model of streaming services over the wireless networks .",
    "since the performance measures depend on the autocorrelation structure of the traffic , a consensus exists about the limitation of the poisson process to model the traffic behaviour . in @xcite , authors develop an analytical framework to investigate the impact of network dynamics on the user perceived video quality , they model the playback buffer by a g / g/1 queue and use the diffusion approximation method to compute the qoe .",
    "the qoe of streaming from the perspective of the network flow dynamics is studied in @xcite .",
    "the throughput of a tagged user is governed by the number of the other users in the network .",
    "this study shows that the network flow dynamics is the fundamental reason for playback starvation . +",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section [ model ] , we describe the system model while section [ qsm ] presents the analysis of the queuing system model . section [ paq ] describes the performance analysis of the quality of experience and section [ 2mmpp ] presents explicit results for two states mmfm .",
    "section [ na ] shows numerical results and section [ clc ] concludes this paper .",
    "we consider a single user receiving a media file with finite size @xmath0 in streaming .",
    "generally , media files are divided into blocks of frames . when a user makes a request the server segments this media into frames and transfers them to the user through the network ( wired and wireless links ) .",
    "when frames traverse the internet , their arrivals are not deterministic due to the dynamics of the available bandwidth .",
    "one of the main characteristics of wireless traffic and internet traffic in general is the rate fluctuation caused by fast fading and slow fading due to shadowing , dynamic interference , and changing load .",
    "moreover , data packet arrivals in cellular networks are found to be correlated over both short and long - time scales .",
    "this is generally due to the arrival of packets bursts of comparable size , often leading to high instantaneous arrival rates .",
    "hence , video flows through the internet with fluctuating speed . in this paper",
    ", we assume that frames arrive to the play - out buffer with a rate that can take values from finite set @xmath1 .",
    "the rate of arrival frames is governed by a continuous - time markov chain ( ctmc ) @xmath2 with infinitesimal generator @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 where @xmath5 .",
    "the maximum buffer size is assumed to be large enough so that the whole file can be stored . at the user side ,",
    "incoming frames are stocked in a buffer and from there they are played with a rate @xmath6 ( e.g. , 25 frames per second ( fps ) ) in the tv and movie - making business .",
    "we quantify the user perceived media quality using two measures called start - up delay and starvation .",
    "there is ongoing research on mapping these two measures on standard human evaluated qoe measures .",
    "as explained earlier , the media player wants to avoid the starvation by prefetching packets .",
    "however , this action might incur a long waiting time . in what follows",
    ", we reveal the relationship between the start - up delay and the starvation behaviour , with the consideration of the file size .",
    "we consider a fluid model that has been proven to be a powerful modeling paradigm in many applications and relevant to capture the key characteristics that determine the performance of networks .",

    "this is an important measure because it allows one to achieve the buffer requirements in setting up the desired values .",
    "indeed , a very small threshold do not help to reduce the starvation probability and very large thresholds do not further reduce the starvation probability .",
    "hence the analytical model aims to predict the player buffer behavior in video streaming sessions .",
    "the network parameters and the video size are the framework inputs that can be used to improve the qoe related to user preferences .      in this section ,",
    "we introduce an optimization problem of the qoe by including different metrics and incorporating user preferences by associated a weight to each metric .",
    "we denote by @xmath250 the cost of a user watching the media stream , @xmath251 where @xmath252 is the number of starvation , @xmath14 is the start - up delay , @xmath253 is the lost on video quality and @xmath254 is the fraction of the total session time spent in low bit - rate .",
    "@xmath255 , @xmath256 and @xmath257 are depending on the user preferences of the three metrics ( starvation , start - up delay and video quality ) .",
    "based on the user preferences , we compare the cost of qoe for two scenarios . in scenario 1 ,",
    "the adaptive bitrate streaming is not used and for the second scenario , the adaptive bitrate streaming is used in order to adjust the quality of a video stream according the available bandwidth .",
    "we consider a network that throughput varies between 200kbps and 400kbps .",
    "for the adaptive bitrate streaming , we have two coding rates depending on the throughput .",
    "this leads to two different frame sizes ( 10kbits , 20kbits ) .",
    "then we compute the cost @xmath258 for @xmath259 and @xmath260 .",
    "[ progadap ] and [ progadap2 ] , we compare the cost for the two scenarios . for short video duration",
    ", the adaptive bitrate streaming is not benefit because there is a less number of starvation and the quality of the video is degraded .",
    "but , for the long video duration , the adaptive bitrate streaming becomes interesting because the low coding rate decreases the number of the starvation . in fig .",
    "[ progadap ] and [ progadap2 ] , we can see that the value of the parameter @xmath257 changes the preference of the user for the quality of the video . for @xmath261 , @xmath262",
    ", we use the adaptive bitrate streaming when the size of the file is more than 400 , 600 frames respectively .",
    "otherwise , the adaptive bitrate streaming is not necessary .    ,",

    "in this paper , we have proposed a new analytical framework to compute the qoe of video streaming in the network modeled by the markov modulated fluid model .",
    "we found the probability of starvation and the start - up delay in solving partial differential equations through the laplace transform method .",
    "this allowed us to compute the number of starvation during the video session that is an important metric of the quality of experience of the user .",
    "in addition , we have presented simulation results using ns3 to show the correctness of our model . we have proposed a method to optimize the quality of experience given a trade - off between the player starvation and the quality of the video .",
