    "it was conjectured , and proved in many cases , that these theories are equivalent : the equivalence of dt and pt theories was proved in  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite using hall algebras , and the equivalence of gw and pt theories was proved by pandharipande - pixton  @xcite for many calabi - yau 3-folds including quintic 3-folds using degenerations and torus localizations .",
    "on the other hand , the derived category of coherent sheaves @xmath0 on a calabi - yau 3-fold @xmath1 is also an important mathematical subject , due to its role in kontsevich s homological mirror symmetry conjecture  @xcite .",
    "it was suggested by pandharipande - thomas  @xcite that the derived category also plays a crucial role in curve counting , as their stable pair invariants count two term complexes @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a pure one dimensional sheaf and @xmath4 is surjective in dimension one . in this paper , we concern how symmetries in the derived categories affect stable pair invariants .",
