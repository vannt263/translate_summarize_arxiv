    "<S> the effect of electron - photon coupling is naturally strongest when the resistance describing the electromagnetic environment equals the sns normal - state resistance , i.e. , @xmath89 , and as much noise as possible is coupled to the junction , and therefore @xmath61 is as large as possible @xcite . for completeness , we show the effect of varying these parameters in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> we find out that the major effect on the current increase comes from frequencies @xmath90 , so that a further increase of the cutoff frequency beyond a few @xmath91 does not affect the increase much . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the incoherent reduction of the supercurrent ( at low temperatures , for example ) increases in strength as the noise bandwidth is increased . </S>",
    "<S> we also point out that the `` optimal '' matching of noise takes place at @xmath54 somewhat larger than the normal - state resistance @xmath8 of the sns junction , but the order of magnitude of the effect depends quite weakly on their ratio .     vs. the parameters of the circuit at the temperatures indicated in the figure . </S>",

    "<S> let us estimate the typical parameters for the electron - photon coupling in sns junctions @xcite , where the authors report at low temperatures a 7 % difference between their experimental results and the theory that does not take into account phase fluctuations . a cu wire of length 1 @xmath95 m , diffusion constant @xmath96 m@xmath97/s and normal - state resistance @xmath98 @xmath99 has a thouless energy @xmath100 @xmath95ev and a zero - temperature critical current of 650 @xmath95a . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to the josephson energy @xmath101 ev , allowing to increase the ( noise ) temperature of the electromagnetic environment to very large values before any phase diffusion could be observed . increasing @xmath66 decreases the critical current and thereby @xmath49 , but the observation of phase diffusion would require quite high @xmath66 . on the other hand , the change in the supercurrent due to electron - photon coupling is @xmath102 , where we assume @xmath103 , @xmath104 is the dimensionless number plotted in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tdep]-[fig : matching ] at perfect matching , and @xmath105 at @xmath106 . for cu , </S>",
    "<S> a typical electron - phonon scattering rate at @xmath107 mk is 20 khz @xcite , corresponding to the temperature scale of @xmath108 @xmath95k . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for a typical @xmath109  @xmath99 , we get @xmath110 for @xmath111 k. as the sns junctions are typically connected to a measurement equipment residing at higher temperatures , the noise coupling from such equipment may well result in noise temperatures of this order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , many experiments are conducted on higher - resistance samples than those considered above , in which case the required temperature difference decreases . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our results may explain the typically encountered difference between the experimental results and the standard theoretical predictions @xcite as being caused by electron - photon coupling . </S>",
    "<S> however , to really probe the effect we are predicting , the environmental noise should be systematically varied while measuring the supercurrent . </S>",
    "<S> the previous can be done for example by passing a large heating current through a macroscopic shunt resistor of the sns junction .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> _ we have shown that whereas the typical and well - known mechanism of the effect of phase fluctuations on the supercurrent through superconductor - normal - metal - superconductor junctions , dependent on the parameter @xmath112 , can often be disregarded , the heat current due to the temperature difference between the electromagnetic environment and the sns junction leads to much more pronounced effects . at low temperatures @xmath113 </S>",
    "<S> , this results into a suppression of the observed supercurrent , but what is more remarkable , for @xmath114 , we predict an _ increased _ supercurrent , competing with the exponentially suppressed bare supercurrent . </S>",
    "<S> our predictions should be tested by simply varying the temperature of the electromagnetic environment while keeping that of the sns junction constant . besides weak links fabricated of normal metals , similar effects can be expected for other types of conducting weak links , such as those made of graphene , carbon nanotubes or semiconductor nanowires .    </S>",
