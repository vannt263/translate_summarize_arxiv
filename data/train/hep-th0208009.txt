    "[ sec : introduction ] for the past one and a half years vacuum string field theory ( vsft )  @xcite has been studied intensively .",
    "the distinguishing feature of this theory is that the kinetic operator is made purely out of ghost operators so that its equation of motion allows us to have solutions of matter - ghost factorized form . since in bosonic string theory",
    "there is essentially only one kind of d - brane , it has been assumed that d - brane solutions in vsft have the factorized form @xmath5 and that its ghost part @xmath6 is common to all d@xmath7-branes  @xcite .",
    "this assumption has successfully been tested by showing that such solutions correctly reproduce the ratios of d - brane tensions , in which only the matter part of the solutions was needed . as a matter of fact",
    ", many encouraging results have been obtained from the analysis of the matter sector : not only the ratios of tensions  @xcite and various d - brane configurations  @xcite but also the overall d25-brane tension  @xcite and the fluctuation spectrum around the brane solution  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it has not been discussed whether the solutions of the ghost equation of motion proposed in  @xcite are suited for the description of the d - brane or not .",
    "anyway , in section  [ sec : solution ] of the present paper we will give arguments based on the assumption that the twisted ghost sliver state introduced in  @xcite really describes the universal ghost solution for bosonic d - branes .",
    "in the type ii superstring case , there are two kinds of d - branes : stable bps d - branes and unstable non - bps ones .",
    "because of the qualitative difference between these two families , even if all d - brane solutions in vacuum superstring field theory have the matter - ghost factorized form and each of the families has its universal ghost solutions , there is no apparent reason to assume that the two ghost solutions should also agree with each other . in case",
    "they are really different , we will be forced to consider the full matter+ghost system even for the calculation of ratios of tensions between a bps d - brane and a non - bps d - brane . as another issue peculiar to the superstring case",
    ", there is a question of how the spacetime supersymmetry is restored around the tachyon vacuum : after the non - supersymmetric non - bps d - branes or brane  antibrane systems have completely decayed through the tachyon condensation , it is believed that there remains the true vacuum for the type ii closed superstrings without any d - branes , where @xmath8 spacetime supersymmetry should exist .",
    "considering that the exact tachyon vacuum solution has not been obtained so far and that it seems difficult to investigate the supersymmetric structure in the level truncation scheme , the only way to proceed is to construct superstring field theory around the tachyon vacuum directly .",
    "although we have no idea up to now how this phenomenon of supersymmetry restoration should be described in terms of _ open _ string degrees of freedom , if we are to take the vacuum string field theory proposal seriously this is a problem of the kind that should be resolved within this theory . for this purpose",
    ", it is obvious that we must reveal the complete structure of the theory including both neveu - schwarz ( ns ) and ramond ( r ) sectors . )",
    "sectors have been discussed by yoneya  @xcite in the context of witten s cubic open superstring field theory  @xcite . ] as a first step toward this goal , we consider in this paper the ns sector only .",
    "the above two interesting problems have motivated us to study in detail the ghost structure of superstring field theory around the tachyon vacuum .",
    "the study of ghost kinetic operator in vacuum superstring field theory was initiated by arefeva _ et .",
    "those authors argued that the kinetic operator @xmath0 around the tachyon vacuum may contain a grassmann - even operator @xmath9 that mixes the gso(@xmath10 ) sectors of the string field , and proposed two possible candidates for the pure - ghost kinetic operator @xmath1 where @xmath2 was represented by linear combinations of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "however , they have not shown on what principle they determined the precise form of @xmath1 . in the present paper",
    "we adopt as a guiding principle the ` twist invariance ' of the action , which exists in the original ( bosonic , 0-picture cubic super and berkovits super ) string field theories on d - branes , reinforced with the gauge invariance .",
    "in fact , if the tachyon vacuum solution is represented by a twist - even string field configuration as has been the case in the level truncation calculations , this twist symmetry should survive in vacuum string field theory action . as a result",
    ", we will put forward a candidate different from theirs , and show that our choice gives rise to consistent gauge invariant actions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "proposal ] we fix the form of the ghost kinetic operator @xmath1 from the requirement of the twist invariance of the cubic action , and then examine its properties . in section  [ sec : solution ] we try to solve the equations of motion , but we find a solution only in an approximation scheme . in section  [ sec : nonpoly ]",
    "we extend the results obtained in the previous sections for the cubic theory to the non - polynomial superstring field theory by berkovits . in section",
    "[ sec : sumdis ] we summarize our results and have discussion on further research . in appendices",
    "we expose the technical details about the inner derivation formula for @xmath2 and the twist invariance of our action .",
    "[ sec : proposal ] in sections [ sec : proposal ] and [ sec : solution ] , we consider the cubic vacuum superstring field theory  @xcite .",
    "we first argue that a gso(@xmath10)-mixing grassmann - even sector @xmath9 generally arises in the kinetic operator @xmath0 around the tachyon vacuum , following  @xcite , and that this is in fact necessary in order to have the expected structure of vacuum superstring field theory action .",
    "we then use the twist symmetry to determine the form of purely ghostly kinetic operator @xmath1 , and propose that this operator describes the open superstrings around one of the tachyon vacua .",
    "let us begin with the cubic action for the neveu - schwarz sector string field @xmath13 in the background of a non - bps d - brane  @xcite : @xmath14 , \\label{eq : aa}\\ ] ] where the _ internal chan - paton _ structure is @xmath15 and the trace tr is taken over the space of these @xmath16 matrices ( @xmath17 s are the pauli matrices ) .",
    "the gso(@xmath3 ) sector string field @xmath18 is grassmann - odd and consists of states with integer weights , while the gso(@xmath4 ) field @xmath19 is grassmann - even and has half - odd - integer weights .",
    "both of them have ghost number 1 and picture number 0 .",
    "the bracket @xmath20 is defined in terms of the correlation functions in the world - sheet cft as is not well - defined for vertex operators of non - integer weights @xmath21 unless we fix the phase ambiguity .",
    "we will mention it when it is needed . ]",
    "@xmath22 where @xmath23 and in particular , @xmath24 note that since the inverse picture - changing operator @xmath25 is a primary field of conformal weight 0 , it is not affected by conformal transformations that keep the open string midpoint @xmath26 fixed .    by taking the trace over the internal chan - paton matrices in advance , the action  ( [ eq : aa ] ) can be rewritten explicitly in terms of @xmath27 as @xmath28 .",
    "\\label{eq : ag}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this expression , one can immediately see that this action is invariant under the sign - flip of the gso(@xmath4 ) sector string field : @xmath29 .",
    "this symmetry guarantees that the effective potential for the ` real ' ) sector  @xcite . ]",
    "tachyon field living in the gso(@xmath4 ) sector takes the left - right symmetric double - well form .",
    "now , postulating the solution @xmath30 corresponding to one of the doubly - degenerate tachyon vacua , we expand the string field @xmath13 around it as @xmath31",
    ". then part of the action quadratic in the fluctuation fields @xmath32 is found to be @xmath33 where we have used the cyclicity relation of the 3-string vertex : @xmath34 with @xmath35 denoting the conformal weight of @xmath36 .",
    "that is to say , if the vertex operator @xmath36 to be moved is in the gso(@xmath4 ) sector an additional minus sign arises .",
    "this is due to the @xmath37-rotation @xmath38 of the unit disk , which provides a conformal factor @xmath39^{h_{a_3}}=e^{2\\pi ih_{a_3}}$ ]  @xcite .",
    "note that  ( [ eq : ah ] ) contains cross - terms among @xmath40 and @xmath41 through the help of @xmath42 . in the matrix notation  ( [ eq : aa ] ) , the same quadratic action is also written as @xmath43 where we have used the fact that the hatted fields satisfy the cyclicity relation without any sign factor because the @xmath4 sign for the gso(@xmath4 ) field appearing in  ( [ eq : ai ] ) is compensated for by one more sign arising from @xmath44 . here",
    "we define the new kinetic operator around the tachyon vacuum as @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the ghost number of @xmath47 . to understand why we have adopted the ghost number grading instead of the grassmannality , recall that the internal chan - paton factors have originally been introduced in such a way that the gso(@xmath10 ) string fields with different grassmannalities obey the same algebraic relations  @xcite .",
    "note that if we restrict ourselves to the gso(@xmath3 ) states , these two gradings agree with each other : @xmath48",
    ". holds among the ghost number @xmath46 , grassmannality @xmath49 and gso parity @xmath50 of @xmath47 .",
    "] by using @xmath0 defined in  ( [ eq : ak ] ) , eq.([eq : aj ] ) can further be rewritten as @xmath51 comparing eqs.([eq : ah ] ) and ( [ eq : al ] ) , we notice that @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( as well as @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) must be non - zero in general , because the tachyon vacuum solution @xmath30 contains non - zero gso(@xmath4 ) components @xmath42 and there is no reason that @xmath56 and @xmath57 should vanish in  ( [ eq : ah ] ) .",
    "this can be achieved by letting @xmath0 have the following internal chan - paton structure  @xcite : @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath9 are grassmann - odd and grassmann - even operators respectively .",
    "explicit actions of @xmath60 can be found by comparing the both sides of eq.([eq : ak ] ) .",
    "when @xmath1 acts on a string field @xmath61 of _ odd ghost number _ of the form @xmath62 we find @xmath63 where the gso(@xmath3 ) component @xmath64 is grassmann - odd and the gso(@xmath4 ) component @xmath65 is grassmann - even .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath1 acts on a string field @xmath66 of _ even ghost number _ having the form @xmath67 we obtain @xmath68 where @xmath69 is grassmann - even and @xmath70 is grassmann - odd .",
    "these two sets ( [ eq : qxodd ] ) , ( [ eq : qyeven ] ) of equations can be written in a unified manner as @xmath71 for @xmath72 of any ghost number and of any gso parity , where @xmath73 denotes the grassmannality of @xmath72 ( @xmath74 mod 2 if @xmath72 is grassmann - even / odd ) and @xmath75 represents the gso parity of @xmath72 ( @xmath76 if @xmath72 is in the gso(@xmath10 ) sector ) .",
    "the difference in the chan - paton structures for even and odd ghost number string fields , ( [ eq : xodd ] ) and ( [ eq : yeven ] ) , comes from the consistency of the @xmath77-product : for example , @xmath77-multiplication of two string fields both having ghost number 1 must give rise to a structure appropriate for a string field of ghost number 2 , and the set of all ghost number 0 string fields must form a closed subalgebra under the @xmath77-product .",
    "here we argue that non - zero @xmath9 is necessary to have a sensible vacuum superstring field theory . to this end , suppose that we are given @xmath78 , so @xmath79 .",
    "since this @xmath0 has the same structure as @xmath80 , the action expanded around the tachyon vacuum would again take the same form as the original one  ( [ eq : ag ] ) with @xmath81 replaced by @xmath59 and @xmath27 denoting the fluctuations around the tachyon vacuum .",
    "then , for the same reason as the one mentioned above , the ` string field theory around the tachyon vacuum ' would have a @xmath82-reflection symmetry under @xmath83 , which means that if we have a solution @xmath84 then we find one more solution @xmath85 with the same energy density .",
    "however , we do not expect such a degeneracy of solutions to exist in vacuum superstring field theory ( figure  [ fig : pot ] ) .",
    "[ 0.7]).,title=\"fig : \" ]    there remains a possibility that any relevant solutions in this theory , such as d - branes , consist only of gso(@xmath3 ) components so that we can avoid having a pair of degenerate solutions , but we do not believe that this is the case .",
    "next we show that @xmath9 plays the rle of removing this unwanted degeneracy . making use of the new kinetic operator @xmath0 defined in  ( [ eq : ak ] ) or ( [ eq : an])([eq : ao ] ) , we can write the cubic superstring field theory action around the tachyon vacuum as @xmath86 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & -\\frac{1}{2g_o^2}\\mathrm{tr}\\left[\\frac{1}{2}{\\langle\\!\\langle}\\widehat{y}_{-2}|\\widehat{a},\\widehat{q}\\widehat{a } { \\rangle\\!\\rangle}+\\frac{1}{3}{\\langle\\!\\langle}\\widehat{y}_{-2}|\\widehat{a},\\widehat{a}*\\widehat{a}{\\rangle\\!\\rangle}\\right ] , \\label{eq : aq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have omitted a constant term . in the second line of eq.([eq : ap ] ) the gso(@xmath4 ) string field @xmath41 enters the action linearly , so that the above - mentioned @xmath82 symmetry is absent in this action . at this stage",
    "the kinetic operator @xmath0 is regular and is not considered to be pure ghost . in the next subsection we will try to determine the form of the purely ghostly kinetic operator @xmath1 which is supposed to arise after a suitable singular field redefinition .",
    "let us briefly review the argument of gaiotto , rastelli , sen and zwiebach  @xcite about the origin of a pure - ghost kinetic operator of bosonic vacuum string field theory .",
    "first assume that a regular representative @xmath87 of an equivalence class of kinetic operators around the tachyon vacuum takes the following form @xmath88 where @xmath89 are functions of @xmath90 and @xmath91 s are local operators of ghost number 1 with conformal weights higher than that of @xmath92 .",
    "then consider performing a reparametrization of the open string coordinate : @xmath93 , which keeps the open string midpoint @xmath94 fixed and is symmetric about it . while this operation does not change the @xmath77-product",
    ", it induces a transformation on the operator  ( [ eq : ar ] ) as @xmath95 if we choose @xmath96 such that @xmath97 near @xmath98 with small @xmath99 , the integrand of the first term becomes large around @xmath98 and , in the limit @xmath100 , all other contributions can be neglected . in this way we have obtained simple but singular constituents of pure - ghost kinetic operator : @xmath101 and @xmath102 in the upper half plane coordinate .",
    "the relative coefficient between these two terms will be fixed by requiring that the kinetic operator @xmath103 preserve the twist invariance of the action .",
    "it is known that the bosonic cubic open string field theory action @xmath104 \\label{eq : at}\\ ] ] has a twist symmetry  @xcite . on an arbitrary @xmath105-eigenstate",
    "@xmath106 the twist operator @xmath107 acts as @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the @xmath105-eigenvalue of @xmath106 .",
    "it can be shown that the action  ( [ eq : at ] ) is twist - invariant , @xmath110  @xcite . thanks to this property , we could restrict the string field to be twist - even in computing the tachyon potential  @xcite .",
    "the proof of the twist - invariance of the action uses the fact that the usual brst operator @xmath81 commutes with the twist operator @xmath107 : @xmath111 this property holds because @xmath81 is the zero - mode of the brst current @xmath112 so that it does not change the @xmath105-eigenvalue of the state .",
    "let us now turn to bosonic vacuum string field theory whose action is given by @xmath113 , \\label{eq : aw}\\ ] ] where , according to the arguments of the last paragraph , the kinetic operator @xmath103 is some linear combination of @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "since the original action  ( [ eq : at ] ) has the twist symmetry and the tachyon vacuum solution is believed to be represented by a twist - even configuration  @xcite , it is natural to assume that the vsft action  ( [ eq : aw ] ) also has twist symmetry . for this action to be twist invariant , @xmath103 must commute with @xmath107 : @xmath116 since we have @xmath117 @xmath103 satisfies the twist - invariance condition  ( [ eq : ax ] ) if @xmath103 consists of even modes @xmath118 only .",
    "this requirement uniquely fixes the relative normalization as  @xcite @xmath119 where an overall normalization constant has been absorbed into the definition of the string field .",
    "this kinetic operator was shown  @xcite to agree with the one found in  @xcite by requiring that the siegel gauge solution should solve the equations of motion in the full gauge - unfixed field configuration space .",
    "now we turn to the superstring case , where there are two negative - dimensional operators @xmath92 and @xmath120 .",
    "suppose that after a reparametrization of the string coordinate implemented by a function @xmath121 , the kinetic operator is written as @xmath122^{-1}c(f(\\sigma))\\otimes \\sigma_3   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi}d\\sigma\\ a_{\\gamma}(\\sigma)[f^{\\prime}(\\sigma)]^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\gamma ( f(\\sigma))\\otimes i\\sigma_2+\\ldots .",

    "@xmath422 , it then gives a solution in the non - polynomial theory because we have @xmath458 where ( [ eq : fs ] ) was used .",
    "furthermore , we expect that the solution @xmath422 in the non - polynomial theory has the same physical interpretation as the corresponding one @xmath456 in the cubic theory .",
    "in particular , the forms of the new kinetic operators around these solutions are , respectively , @xmath459 and @xmath460 since we have determined @xmath422 such that @xmath461 is satisfied , these kinetic operators @xmath462 , each of which describes the perturbative physics around the corresponding solution , should agree with each other .",
    "this result strongly supports the claim that the solutions @xmath456 and @xmath422 of the two theories related through  ( [ eq : fu ] ) share a common physical interpretation .",

    "we have also tried to solve the equations of motion of cubic vacuum superstring field theory , but obtained only an approximate solution in an @xmath99-expansion method .",
    "finally we have suggested a way of generating the solution in the non - polynomial theory which physically corresponds to a given solution in the cubic theory , with its precise algorithm left to be clarified .    to completely understand the nature of superstring field theory around the tachyon vacuum , many things still remain to be done . at the level of the determination of the kinetic operator @xmath1 , aside from a proportionality constant",
    "we have not been able to uniquely fix the form of the non - leading part of @xmath185 , which has been added _ by hand _ in order to make @xmath1 be nilpotent .",
    "it might be that , after successfully including the ramond sector field in vacuum superstring field theory , the requirement of spacetime supersymmetry restored around the ` type ii closed string vacuum ' puts further constraints on the form of @xmath1 .    at the level of the construction of classical solutions",
    ", we have not obtained exact expressions even for the solution representing the most fundamental non - bps d9-brane . moreover , the expressions for our approximate solution are plagued with many vanishing or diverging factors , as is often the case with the singular representative of vacuum string field theory . in the bosonic case ,",
    "such a ` formal ' argument was partly justified by showing  @xcite that the twisted sliver solution coincides with the siegel gauge solution found in  @xcite in a less singular algebraic approach .",
