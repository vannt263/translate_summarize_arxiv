    "micrornas ( mirnas ) are a class of small , noncoding rnas which regulate gene expression in prokaryotes and eukaryotes at the post - transcriptional level . they play critical roles in a number of cellular processes , such as stress response , developmental transitions , differentiation , apoptosis etc . @xcite",
    ". the mechanisms of regulation by small rnas differ in specific features in prokaryotes and eukaryotes .",
    "these are , however , based on the common principle of the regulatory rna base - pairing with the messenger rna ( mrna ) of the target gene inhibiting translation and/or promoting mrna degradation .",
    "various possibilities have been suggested for the fate of the inactive complex of the regulatory rna and the target mrna once it is formed @xcite : ( i ) the complex has a finite lifetime followed by dissociation into its free components , ( ii ) the regulatory rna co - degrades with the target mrna at the same or different rates and ( iii ) only the target mrna degrades with the regulatory rna becoming free for further activity @xcite .",
    "a number of functional features of rna - regulated gene expression have been identified so far @xcite .",
    "one prominent feature is that of a threshold linear mode of action , in which the target gene protein synthesis is highly repressed below a threshold level of target mrna production and activated in a linear fashion once the threshold is crossed .",
    "other significant characteristics include : suppression of protein fluctuations in the form of translational bursts , rapid response times and filtering of transient signals @xcite , sharpening of spatial expression patterns @xcite and prioritisation of the expression of target genes in the case of a single rna regulating the expression of multiple genes @xcite .",
    "recently , a mathematical model has been proposed @xcite to describe the biochemical interactions and kinetics of mirna - mediated regulation of gene expression .",
    "the model has been experimentally validated in single cell measurements using quantitative fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry .",
    "the experiments clearly demonstrate the high repression of target protein synthesis below a threshold level of target mrna production , and a sensitive response above the threshold .",
    "a major finding is that the strength of the repression below the threshold has considerable cell - to - cell variation in a population of genetically - identical cells .",
    "this indicates that stochasticity may have non - trivial consequences in mirna - mediated regulation of gene expression .",
    "figure [ fig_scheme ] shows a sketch of the different biochemical processes involved in the mirna - mediated regulation of gene expression , and which form the basis of the mathematical model proposed in @xcite .",
    "the mrna , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_scheme ] , is either free ( @xmath0 ) or is part of a mirna - mrna complex ( @xmath1 ) . the target mrna is transcribed with rate constant @xmath2 and has a natural degradation rate constant @xmath3 .",
    "the rate constants @xmath4 and @xmath5 are associated with the formation and dissociation of the bound complex of mrna and mirna . the bound mirna becomes free either by unbinding the target mrna ( rate constant @xmath6 or by degrading the mrna ( rate constant @xmath7 ) .",
    "the model incorporates the important feature of molecular titration similar to the protein - protein titration analysed earlier @xcite .",
    "protein sequestration occurs when a repressor protein binds an active protein thus forming an inactive complex . as shown in @xcite , the regulatory mechanism , termed molecular titration , can generate ultrasensitive input - output responses . in the case of mirna - mediated regulation of gene expression , the inactive complex is that of mrna and mirna .",
    "molecular titration is responsible for the observed sensitive dependence of protein expression on target mrna input around a threshold level of target mrna production .     and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "the rate constants @xmath4 and @xmath5 describe the formation and dissociation of the bound complex @xmath1 of free mrna @xmath0 and the mirna .",

    "[ fig_scheme ] is considered . in this model ,",
    "the only stochasticity is associated with the random transitions between the inactive and active expression states of the gene . in the inactive state , there is no transcriptional activity , i.e. , mrna synthesis .",
    "transcription is only initiated in the active state of the gene .",
    "the degradation of the mrna occurs in both the inactive and active states of the gene .",
    "we show that binary gene expression is a possible outcome in both of the scenarios described above . in the deterministic case ,",
    "binary gene expression implies bistability , i.e. , the coexistence of two stable expression states . in the stochastic case ,",
    "the distribution of mrna levels is bimodal , i.e. , has two prominent peaks . in the following , we analyse the deterministic and stochastic models to investigate the origins of binary gene expression .",

    "the plot exhibits hysteresis since the discontinuous transitions from the lower to the upper branch , and from the upper to the lower branch , occur at different values of the parameter @xmath31 , the so - called bifurcation points of the associated dynamics .",
    "bistability constitutes a universal theme in several cell biological processes @xcite and signifies that a cell has a choice between two stable expression states for the same parameter values .",

    "figure 2(d ) shows a similar phase diagram in the @xmath41 plane .",
    "bistability , in general , is an outcome of dynamics involving positive feedback and sufficient nonlinearity .",
    "the latter condition is usually achieved via the binding of the regulatory protein molecules at multiple sites of the promoter region of the gene , or when the regulatory proteins form multimers , such as dimers and tetramers , which then bind specific regions of the dna ( cooperativity in regulation ) @xcite . in the case of transcriptional regulation ,",
    "tan et al .",
    "@xcite have proposed a new mechanism by which a noncooperative positive feedback loop combined with a nonlinear protein decay term are sufficient to generate bistability .",
    "this novel type of bistability was demonstrated in the operation of a synthetic gene circuit .",
    "the circuit contains a single autoregulatory positive feedback loop in which the protein product x of a gene promotes its own synthesis in a noncooperative fashion .",
    "the protein decay rate is a sum of two terms , the natural degradation rate and the dilution rate due to cell growth . in the synthetic circuit ,",
    "the production of x inhibits cell growth so that the dilution rate of x and hence the protein decay rate are reduced .",
    "this gives rise to an effective positive feedback loop , since an increased synthesis of x proteins leads to a greater accumulation of the proteins , which in turn activates further protein synthesis .",
    "the combination of two positive feedback loops gives rise to bistability in a parameter regime in the absence of cooperativity .",
    "a related study by klumpp et al .",
    "@xcite has also demonstrated the generation of a positive feedback loop due to cell growth inhibition by a protein .",
    "the nonlinear protein decay term in these cases ( ` emergent bistability ' ) has the same form as in eq .",
    "the origin of the nonlinearity is , however , different in the case of the post - transcriptional , i.e. , mirna - mediated regulation of gene expression .",
    "the effect of a transcriptional positive feedback loop on mirna - regulated gene expression has been investigated in a number of earlier studies @xcite . specifically , bistability has been demonstrated in cases where the transcriptional positive feedback loop involves some form of cooperativity .",
    "our present study establishes a new origin of bistability in mirna - regulated gene expression , based on a non - cooperative transcriptional positive feedback loop and a nonlinear protein decay term . since our model closely follows the experimentally - tested model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the inclusion of a transcriptional positive feedback loop in the original gene circuit could provide an experimental test of the new mechanism of bistability suggested by us .",

    "<S> microrna - mediated regulation of gene expression is characterised by some distinctive features that set it apart from unregulated and transcription factor - regulated gene expression . recently </S>",
    "<S> , a mathematical model has been proposed to describe the dynamics of post - transcriptional regulation by micrornas . </S>",
    "<S> the model explains the observations made in single cell experiments quite well . in this paper , we introduce some additional features into the model and consider two specific cases . in the first case , a non - cooperative positive feedback loop is included in the transcriptional regulation of the target gene expression . in the second case , a stochastic version of the original model </S>",
    "<S> is considered in which there are random transitions between the inactive and active expression states of the gene . in the first case we show that bistability is possible in a parameter regime , due to the presence of a non - linear protein decay term in the gene expression dynamics . in the second case , we derive the conditions for obtaining stochastic binary gene expression . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this type of gene expression is more favourable in the case of regulation by micrornas as compared to the case of unregulated gene expression . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical predictions relating to binary gene expression are experimentally testable . </S>"
