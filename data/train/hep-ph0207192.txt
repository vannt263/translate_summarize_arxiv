    "the advent of the @xmath9-factory era in kek and slac opens a new chance for very suppressed @xmath9 decays .",
    "nonleptonic two - body decays into tensor @xmath10 mesons , among them , deserve much attention nowadays .",
    "experimental data on them provides only upper bounds of the branching ratios .",
    "two - body hadronic @xmath9 decays involving a tensor meson @xmath11 in the final state has long been studied @xcite using the non - relativistic quark model of isgur , scora , grinstein , and wise ( isgw ) @xcite with the factorization ansatz .",
    "their predictions for the branching ratios are rather small while the preliminary results from the belle collaboration indicate that the branching ratios for @xmath12 ( @xmath13 pseudoscalar ) may not be very small compared to @xmath14 modes @xcite .",
    "recently , both charmed and charmless @xmath15 ( @xmath16 vector ) decays were updated @xcite using isgw2 model @xcite which is an hqet - based improvement of its original model .",
    "they are in many respects complementary to @xmath17 decays . in a theoretical point of view",
    ", more reliable description of @xmath18 transition is required .",
    "the biggest obstacle in theoretical predictions is the hadronic matrix elements .",
    "the factorization hypothesis is a widely accepted assumption .",
    "recently , it is pointed out that the factorization parameter @xmath19 is process dependent and there is a nonzero strong phase difference between color - allowed and color - suppressed decay modes , based on the first observation of @xmath20 by belle and cleo @xcite .",
    "it is thus very interesting to see what happens in @xmath21 .",
    "the vector meson @xmath22 and the charmed tensor @xmath23 are members of a doublet @xmath24 with @xmath25 , while @xmath26 corresponds to @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "the neutral decay mode @xmath29 is dominated by the color - suppressed internal @xmath30-emission diagram . within the factorization ( we will not consider the small contributions from the @xmath30- exchange diagram for simplicity ) , the decay amplitude is proportional to @xmath31 .",
    "it can be easily shown , however , that such a factorized term vanishes @xcite .",
    "this is a good advantage of tensor mesons in the final state because the decay amplitude is greatly simplified .",
    "given the factorization assumption , therefore , the hadronic uncertainties are condensed to the @xmath18 transition matrix elements . on the other hand , the observation of sizable branching ratio for @xmath29 would provide the direct information on the nonfactorizable effects @xcite",
    "this is another benefit of studying the production of tensor mesons .",
    "present bounds from the experiments are @xcite @xmath32    in this paper , we analyze the two - body @xmath9 decays into a charmed tensor @xmath23 . heavy quark effective theory ( hqet )",
    "is an appropriate framework in this process . in hqet",
    ", @xmath33 transition matrix element is parametrized by one universal isgur - wise ( iw ) function at leading order of @xmath1 , where @xmath34 is the heavy quark mass .",
    "an extensive study of the leading and subleading iw function in semileptonic decays is found in @xcite . in general , the iw function depends on the velocity transfer @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the 4-velocity of @xmath37 . typically , kinematically allowed range of @xmath38 is very small in @xmath39 transition .",
    "it is customary to parametrize the iw function @xmath40 in terms of its interception @xmath6 and the slope parameter @xmath7 , and expand in @xmath41 .",
    "the branching ratio is directly proportional to @xmath42 . unlike the groundstate to groundstate transition",
    ", the heavy quark symmetry ( hqs ) does not guarantee the normalization of @xmath6 in @xmath33 .",
    "this is because at zero recoil ground- to excited - state transition is suppressed by @xmath43 , due to the hqs .    though the hqet is very economic and allows a systematic expansion of @xmath1 , one still needs some nonperturbative methods to evaluate the iw function . at present work",
    ", we adopt the qcd sum rule results for the @xmath33 leading iw function @xcite .",
    "qcd sum rule is among the most reliable nonperturbative methods @xcite .",
    "it takes into account the nontrivial qcd vacuum which is parametrized by various vacuum condensates in order to describe the nonperturbative nature . in qcd sum rule ,",
    "hadronic observables can be calculated by evaluating two- or three - point correlation functions .",
    "the hadronic currents for constructing the correlation functions are expressed by the interpolating fields . in describing the excited @xmath44 mesons of @xmath24 states , the transverse covariant derivative",
    "is included in the interpolating fields @xcite .    in the next section ,",
    "the decay amplitudes are given within the factorization and the qcd sum rule results for the leading iw function are summarized .",

    "we use the qcd sum rule results at leading order of @xmath1 .",

    "( [ tau ] ) , ( [ f ] ) @xmath87 the errors come from the qcd sum rule parameters , the continuum threshold and the borel parameter .",
    "the decay rate for @xmath12 is in general given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the pseudoscalar three momentum .",
    "we use the wcs of @xcite , where @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the branching ratios for @xmath0 are summarized in table [ t1 ] with the abbreviations    @xmath92    in table [ t1 ] , we give the numerical results for various @xmath93 , while it is reported that @xmath94 @xcite . as a comparison , results from the isgw2 model @xcite are also given .",
    "the qcd sum rule predicts about four - times larger branching ratios . since the decay amplitude is proportional to @xmath95 , the dependence of @xmath96 on @xmath93 is rather mild .",
    "figure [ f0 ] shows the transition form factors as functions of @xmath84 for both qcd sum rule and the isgw2 , where the form factors @xmath97 are defined by    @xmath98    with the linear approximation of ( [ linear ] ) and ( [ linear2 ] ) , the ratio of the hadronic and semileptonic branching ratios is ( with only central values of ( [ linear2 ] ) ) @xmath99 where the estimated total decay rate @xmath100 @xcite is used . in this fraction ,",
    "common factor of @xmath42 is canceled and only the slope parameter @xmath7 remains at leading order .",
    "near future experiments will check the ratio .",
    "one thing interesting is that the value is very close to that of @xmath101 transition @xcite @xmath102    another important ratio is @xmath103 ^ 2 \\left[\\frac{2r_2(1+y_2)-(1-r_2 ^ 2)+r_\\pi^2 }       { ( 1-y_1 ^ 2)-3(1-r_1y_1)+(y_1 - 2)(y_1-r_1)}\\right]^2~ , \\label{r21}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where    @xmath104          [ m_b^2-(m_{d_1,d_2^*}-m_\\pi)^2]}~,\\\\ y_{1,2}&\\equiv & \\frac{m_b^2+m_{d_1,d_2^*}^2-m_\\pi^2}{2m_b m_{d_1,d_2^*}}~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and @xmath105 .",
    "charged decay modes of @xmath106 are both highly dominated by tree amplitudes , and involve the same iw function at the heavy quark limit within the factorization scheme .",
    "we have , at the heavy quark limit , @xmath107 this value is rather small compared to the semileptonic decay ratio ) prediction is larger than experimental data .",
    "see @xcite . ]",
    "@xcite @xmath108 and experiments @xmath109 ( cleo @xcite ) , @xmath110 ( belle @xcite ) .",
    "since the mass difference between @xmath22 and @xmath23 is very small ( @xmath111 ) , ( [ r21 ] ) is quite insensitive to the structure of the leading iw function ; @xmath112 .",
    "the ratio @xmath113 depends on how the relevant form factors are described in hqet , so the subleading analysis might affect the ratio .",
    "the authors of @xcite found that @xmath113 depends on @xmath114 weakly but is very sensitive to the subleading iw functions , ranging from @xmath115 to @xmath116 while neubert in @xcite expects @xmath117 corrections less than 20% , with the leading order prediction @xmath118 .",
    "while the experimental errors are still large ( much reduced in belle ) , the discrepancy between theory and data is significant .",
    "more quantitative and reliable analysis at subleading order in theory and reduced errors in the future experiments will check this hqet framework as well as the factorization .    on the other hand ,",
    "conversely , the experimental bounds on the branching ratios can constrain @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "figure [ contour ] shows the allowed region ( shaded ) of these two parameters from the given branching ratios .",
    "note that the central value of qcd sum rule result @xmath119 resides very near to the boundary .",
    "in addition , measured value of the ratio ( [ nlsl ] ) will determine @xmath7 regardless of @xmath6 .",
    "more precise measurements will thus provide a simple test of leading order description of @xmath33 .",
    "now consider the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections to the above analysis .",
    "the nlo contributions come from both @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in hqet",
    ", @xmath1 corrections appear in a two - fold way . at the lagrangian level ,",
    "subleading terms are summarized in @xmath120 and @xmath121 . in a usual convention",
    ", @xmath120 parametrizes the kinetic term of higher order derivative , while @xmath121 represents the chromomagnetic interaction which explicitly breaks the heavy quark spin symmetry .",
    "their effects are known to be small @xcite . at the current level ,",
    "@xmath1 corrections come from the current matching procedure onto the effective theory .",
    "the correction terms originate from the small portion of the heavy quark fields which corresponds to the virtual motion of the heavy quark . during the current matching ,",
    "eight subleading iw functions are newly introduced and two of them are independent .    compared with the @xmath101 transition , @xmath1 corrections to @xmath33 would be rather small .",
    "this is due to the tensor structure in the final state . at zero recoil ( properties at this point",
    "is very important because kinematically allowed region is quite narrow around it ) , the transition matrix is proportional to @xmath122 as argued briefly in the introduction , vanishing matrix element is well explained by the hqs at the heavy quark limit . on the other hand , for @xmath101 transition at zero recoil , @xmath123 which can be nonzero in general .",
    "that s the reason why nlo corrections are more important in @xmath101 .",
    "another nlo contribution from @xmath124 corrections is studied in @xmath125 decays in @xcite ; it remains a good challenge in @xmath33 process .",
    "finally , if there observed a sizable value of @xmath126 , it should come from the nonfactorizable effects . or",
    "indirectly , the measurement of @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the @xmath9 life - time ratio , would test the validity of the isospin relation ( [ triangle ] ) and the general factorization scheme .",
    "the values in table [ t1 ] , of course , satisfy the relation @xmath129 .",
    "using the qcd sum rule results for the leading iw function of @xmath33 , we investigated the nonleponic two - body decays @xmath0 within the framework of factorization .",
    "the predicted branching ratios are about four times larger than the recent calculations based on the isgw2 .",
    "study of tensor meson is very advantageous because the decay amplitudes are simple , and some of the decay modes are directly related to the nonfactorizable effects .",
    "present @xmath9 factories show a big optimism of producing copious tensor mesons , and more precise and reliable theoretical works are on the request . the nlo analysis of both @xmath43 and @xmath124 , in this respect , is challenging and will improve the theoretical reliability .",
