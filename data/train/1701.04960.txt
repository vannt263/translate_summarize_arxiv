    "secure communication achieved by exploiting the wireless physical layer to provide secrecy in data transmission , has drawn significant recent research attention ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the performance of this type of secure communication can be measured in terms of the secrecy throughput , which is the capacity of conveying information to the intended users while keeping it confidential from eavesdroppers @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "energy efficiency ( ee ) has emerged as another important figure - of - merit in assessing the performance of communication systems @xcite . for most systems ,",
    "both security and energy efficiency are of interest , and thus it is of interest to combine these two metrics into a single performance index called the secrecy ee ( see ) , which can be expressed in terms of secrecy bits per joule .",
    "transmit beamforming can be used to enhance the two conflicting targets for optimizing see in multiple - user multiple - input multiple - output ( mu - mimo ) communications : mitigating mu interference to maximize the users information throughput , and jamming eavesdroppers to control the leakage of information . however , the current approach to treat both ee @xcite and see @xcite is based on costly zero - forcing beamformers , which completely cancel the mu interference and signals received at the eavesdroppers .",
    "the ee / see objective is in the form of a ratio of a concave function and a convex function , which can be optimized by using dinkelbach s algorithm @xcite .",
    "each dinkelbach s iteration still requires a log - det function optimization , which is convex but computationally quite complex .",
    "moreover , zero - forcing beamformers are mostly suitable for low code rate applications and are applicable to specific mimo systems only .",
    "the computational complexity of see for single - user mimo / siso communications as considered in @xcite and @xcite is also high as each iteration still involves a difficult nonconvex optimization problem .",
    "this letter aims to design transmit beamformers to optimize see subject to per - user secrecy quality - of - service ( qos ) and transmit power constraints .",
    "the specific contributions are detailed in the following dot - points .    * a path - following computational procedure , which invokes a simple convex quadratic program at each iteration and converges to at least a locally optimal solution ,",
    "is proposed .",
    "the mu interference and eavesdropped signals are effectively suppressed for optimizing the see .",
    "in contrast to zero - forcing beamformers , higher code rates not only result in transmitting more concurrent data streams but also lead to much better see performance in our proposed beamformer design .",
    "* as a by - product , other important problems in secure and energy - efficient communications , such as ee maximization subject to the secrecy level or sum secrecy throughput maximization , which are still quite open for research , can be effectively addressed by the proposed procedure .",
