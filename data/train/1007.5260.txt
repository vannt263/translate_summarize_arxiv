    "one of the key problems to overcome when conducting multi - wavelength surveys is determining which sources are associated with one another in different wave - bands , and which are unrelated .",
    "when multiple observations have been conducted at similar wavelengths and with similar resolution and sensitivity , this problem can be reliably addressed by using a simple nearest  neighbour match . however , in the situation where the two distinct sets of observations to be matched have considerably different resolution  for example matching far - infrared or sub - millimetre survey data to an optical catalogue ( e.g. sutherland et al . , 1991 , clements et al . , 1996 ,",

    "one method which can be used to identify the most likely counterpart to a low - resolution source , is the likelihood ratio technique ( hereafter lr ) , first suggested by richter ( 1975 ) , and expanded by sutherland &  saunders ( 1992 ) and ciliegi et al .",
    "the crucial advantage of the lr technique over other methods is that it not only uses the positional information contained within the two catalogues , but also includes brightness information ( both of the individual potential counterparts , and of the higher resolution catalogue as a whole ) to identify the most reliable counterpart to a low - resolution source .",

    "herschel_atlas was to obtain the first unbiased survey of the local universe at sub - mm wavelengths , and as a result the survey was designed to overlap with existing large optical and infrared surveys .    in this paper , we present a discussion of our implementation of the lr technique to identify the most reliable counterparts to 250@xmath0m  selected sources in the _ herschel_atlas science demonstration phase ( sdp ) data field ( eales et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "this field was chosen in order to take advantage of multi  wavelength data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss  york et al . , 2000 ) , and the uk infrared deep sky survey large area survey ( ukidss - las  lawrence et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "this field also overlaps with the 9 hour field of the galaxy and mass assembly survey ( gama  driver et al . , 2010 ) .",

    "in section [ lrcalc ] we present the specific lr method that we have used to identify counterparts to 250@xmath0m  selected sources from the _ herschel_atlas sdp catalogue in an @xmath9band catalogue of model magnitudes derived from the sdss dr7 . in section",

    "section [ results ] contains some basic results based on our reliable catalogue , and in section [ conclusions ] we present some concluding remarks about the likelihood ratio technique and the resulting catalogue .",
    "the likelihood ratio , i.e. the ratio between the probability that the source is the correct identification and the corresponding probability for an unrelated background source , is calculated as in sutherland & saunders ( 1992 ) :      in which @xmath13 , and @xmath14 correspond to the sdss @xmath9band magnitude probability distributions of the full @xmath9band catalogue and of the true counterparts to the sub ",

    "herschel_atlas sdp observations , it was necessary to determine the spire positional uncertainties .",
    "since this information was not available _ a priori _ , we empirically estimated @xmath17 using the sdss dr7 @xmath9band catalogue positions , assuming that the sdss positional errors were negligible in comparison to the spire errors . to determine @xmath17 , we derived histograms of the separations between the positions in the mad - x spire catalogue ( rigby et al . , 2010 ) of the @xmath18 250@xmath0 m sources , and all of those objects in the @xmath9band sdss dr7 catalogue within 50 arcsec , doing this for both the north  south and east  west directions ( figure [ fig : clust ] ) .",
    "these histograms can be well  described as the sum of the gaussian positional errors plus the clustering signal for sdss sources convolved with gaussian errors , @xmath19 , with @xmath20 :        where @xmath23 , with @xmath24 being measured in degrees for the purposes of comparison with the literature .",

    "the effects of clustering ( i.e. @xmath31 ) are shown in the top panel of figure [ fig : clust ] .    in order to determine the 1@xmath8 positional error of the 250@xmath0 m selected catalogue",
    ", we conducted a simple @xmath32 fit of our model ( equations [ xhist ] & [ yhist ] ) to the histograms .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : clust ] for the summations in the east - west and north - south directions in the middle and bottom panels respectively .",
    "the clustering signal is shown in the bottom two panels by the dotted lines , with the histograms and their poisson error bars overlaid with the best fit model ( solid lines ) .",
    "the 1@xmath8 positional errors were found to be @xmath33 arcsec and @xmath34 arcsec in the two directions , consistent with one another within the errors .",
    "the advantages of this method are two  fold ; firstly , it is not necessary to identify the counterparts to the 250@xmath0 m sources _ a priori _ , and secondly , the centroids of the best fit gaussians may be used to determine astrometric corrections in the spire maps ( e.g. pascale et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "the value for @xmath17 that we adopted was the weighted mean @xmath35 arcsec .",
    "positional errors of the spire 250@xmath0m  selected sources , we produced histograms of the total number of sdss sources within a box 50 arcsec on a side around the spire 250@xmath0 m centres .",

    "performing a @xmath32 minimisation allows us to then empirically determine the 1@xmath8 positional uncertainty for these sources , which are shown as @xmath36 and @xmath37 . ]    theoretically",
    ", the positional uncertainty should depend on the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the detection and on the full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the spire 250 @xmath0 m beam ( 18.1 arcsec , pascale et al . , 2010 ) , following the results derived in ivison et al .",

    "this leads us to introduce a factor of 1.09 to give equation [ ivison2007 ] :        * whilst it is acceptable to neglect the sdss dr7 positional errors for the purposes of determining @xmath17 ( section [ sec : f_r ] ) , the astrometric precision for sources in the sdss dr7 catalogue is non - zero ( @xmath40 arcsec ",
    "abazajian et al . ,",
    "* large sources , especially those without gaussian surface brightness profiles ( e.g. bright spiral galaxies ) , have considerably larger positional uncertainties associated with them .",
    "* confusion provides a lower limit to the positional errors of the spire catalogue , although the snr in equation [ ivison2007 ] does include confusion noise as described in rigby et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and pascale et al ( 2010 ) .      to account for these effects",

    "finally , @xmath15 must be renormalised so that        calculating the lr requires two further pieces of magnitude information , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the quantity @xmath13 is simply the probability that a background source is observed with magnitude @xmath43 . to estimate this",
    ", we calculate the distribution of sdss dr7 @xmath9band model magnitudes for all of the primary photometry sources in the catalogue , normalised to the total area of the catalogue ( which is approximately 36.0 deg@xmath7 for the sdss catalogue that we use for this purpose ) .",

    "we calculate the @xmath9band magnitude distribution of the counterparts to the 250@xmath0 m sources using the method of ciliegi et al .",
    "this method involves counting all objects in the optical catalogue within some fixed maximum search radius ( @xmath44 ) of the spire positions . to avoid influencing the results of this analysis with erroneous deblends in the sdss dr7 catalogue ( which artificially alter the number counts ) , we eyeballed the sdss @xmath9band images of each of the 5@xmath8 250@xmath0 m sources , removing 370 sdss sources from the input catalogue .",
    "the magnitude distribution of the remaining objects is referred to as total@xmath45 .",
    "here we have adopted @xmath46arcsec , which encloses @xmath4799.996%  of the real counterparts to the 250@xmath0 m sources based on our derived value for @xmath17 .",
    "the distribution total@xmath45 is then background  subtracted to leave the magnitude distribution of excess sources around the 250@xmath0 m centres , real@xmath45 :      where @xmath49 is the number of 250@xmath0 m sources in the catalogue .",
    "this enables us to empirically estimate @xmath14 from the sources in our optical catalogue rather than modelling the @xmath9band magnitude distribution of 250@xmath0m  selected _",
    "herschel_atlas sources .",
    "the distribution @xmath14 is given by equation [ eq : q_m ] :          here @xmath53 represents the number of possible ids within 10.0 arcsec of the spire positions , and @xmath49 is defined as above . since the value of @xmath51 will be different for galaxies and unresolved sources in our catalogue , we must calculate @xmath14 , @xmath13 and @xmath51 separately for each population .",
    "we separate resolved and unresolved sources using a slightly modified version of the gama colour  colour relation from baldry et al .",
    "( 2010 , modified such that @xmath54 rather than 0.20 to avoid adding an unphysical sharp edge to the stellar locus in figure [ fig : stargalsep ] ) .",

    ", 2004 ) , precessing their co  ordinates to the epoch of the _ herschel_atlas sdp observations .",
    "only those unresolved sources with proper motions detected at a snr @xmath55 were updated .",
    "sources in our catalogue classified as unresolved , we find that three satisfy the gama colour selection criteria for being stellar , and so are potentially evolved stars , dust - obscured qsos or debris disk candidates possibly indicative of a proto - planetary system ( e.g. thompson et al . , 2010 ) .",

    "the lobes of this frii are extremely bright ; as a result , the @xmath93 statistic suggests that there is a low probability of a chance association , even though the separation between the spire position and the first centroid is large .",

    "<S> we have estimated photometric redshifts for each of these 2423 reliable counterparts , while 1099 also have spectroscopic redshifts collated from several different sources , including the gama survey . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the completeness of identifying counterparts as a function of redshift , and present evidence that 250@xmath0m - selected _ herschel_-atlas galaxies have a bimodal redshift distribution . </S>",
    "<S> those with reliable optical identifications have a redshift distribution peaking at @xmath5 , while sub - mm colours suggest that a significant fraction with no counterpart above the r - band limit have @xmath6 . </S>",
