    "however , as discussed below , the strong he  i features were detected and the intensities were anomalously strong for sne ic - bl . with the spectra exhibiting he  i , this sn should be classified as an sn ` ib'-bl according to the definition .",
    "spectra up to @xmath2 d exhibited the absorption lines at 5500 , 6300 , and 6850   ( see the inset of figure 1 ) . in this section , we show that these features were attributed to the absorption lines of he  i @xmath35876 , @xmath36678 , and @xmath37065 .",
    "the velocities reached 18,000 km  s@xmath10 , and the corresponding wavelengths were denoted by the vertical gray lines in figures 1 and 2 . in order to confirm the line identification of he",
    "i , we first produced artificially smoothed spectra of sn ic 2007gr @xcite and sn ib 2012au ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "we smoothed the spectra by using gaussian kernel so that the full - width - of - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of absorption lines of sn 2016coi ( 11,000 km  s@xmath10 ) matches to those of sne 2007gr ( 5,000 km  s@xmath10 ) and 2012au ( 7,500 km  s@xmath10 ) .",
    "then , the spectra were further blueshifted to match the positions of the absorption lines .",
    "as shown in figure 4 , the spectrum of sn 2016coi was very similar to the smoothed and blueshifted spectrum of sn 2012au .",
    "we confirmed that in addition to the he  i  @xmath35876 line , both the he  i  @xmath36678 and @xmath37065 features were similar in the spectrum of sn 2016coi and the smoothed and blueshifted spectrum of sn 2012au . on the other hand ,",
    "as expected from type ic identification , the smoothed and blueshifted spectrum of sn 2007gr did not exhibit the he  i absorption lines .",
    "these tests demonstrate that sn 2016coi show the he lines .",
    "the relative absorption depths of the he lines were slightly different in sne 2016coi and 2012au .",
    "we thus further study the possible he  i features of sn 2016coi using the synthetic spectral code , syn++ to assess possible contamination of the other lines in the he features .",
    "the o  i , na  i , si  ii , si  iii , ca  ii , fe  ii , and co  ii were used to reproduce the depth ratio .",
    "figure 5 shows the na  i d and si  iii features would contaminate to the broad line at 5600  . the co  ii  @xmath145914,6019 help to explain the strength of the feature at 5600  . the co  ii  @xmath146540,6570 also support to explain the strong absorption line at 6200  ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "the absorption lines at 5600 , 6200 and 6600  were well explained using these components . on the other hand",
    ", it is hard to explain the depth ratios without he  i lines ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "note that inclusion of co  ii at 3800  , 4400  , and other elements is also consistent with a blue portion of the spectrum .",
    "since fe - group elements strongly affect the spectra in the ultraviolet wavelengths , we calculated @xmath15 color in the synthetic spectrum .",
    "the calculated color ( @xmath15 = 0.6 mag ) is consistent with observed @xmath15 within the error .",
    "the mg  ii and ti  ii features possibly contributes to the spectra below 4500  , but again the u - band flux was consistent with the observed color even including these features .",
    "to study the validity of our spectral fit , we also fit a spectrum of sn 2012au using the same ion species ( he  i , c  i , o  i , na  i , si  ii , si  iii , ca  ii , fe  ii , and co  ii ) . the spectrum could be explained by the synthetic one except for slight differences at 6200 and 6600  .",
    "the absorption features of he  i were well matched .",
    "this suggests that the co  ii features could support to improve the spectral fit .    in summary",
    ", we identified the he features in the pre - maximum spectra of sn 2016coi .",
    "the detection of the he lines has been suggested in other sne ic - bl . for sn ic - bl 2009bb , the identification of he  i",
    "has been discussed @xcite . in sn 2009bb , the he  i@xmath36678 and he  i@xmath37065 features were very weak and the identification was marginal ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the near - infrared spectrum for sn 2012ap exhibited a strong absorption line around 10500   @xcite .",
    "the nir and optical features were simultaneously explained using the synthetic spectra , but they pointed out that the he  i@xmath320587 feature was too weak to explain the strength of he  i@xmath310830 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "compared with these two previous cases , early - phase spectra of sn 2016coi gives more robust identification of the he  i lines , because the lines were stronger than those of sn 2009bb and 2012ap .",
    "the bottom panel of figure 3 shows the comparison of the he  i@xmath35876 line velocities with those of sne ib 1999dn @xcite , 2008d , and 2012au .",
    "the he velocity of sn 2016coi was almost identical to that of si  ii@xmath36355 , and was the fastest among other sne ib until @xmath2 d. again , the si  ii@xmath36355 line velocity of sn 2016coi was very similar to those of sne 1998bw and 2009bb after @xmath16 d. these facts support that sn 2016coi could be classified as an sn ` ib'-bl .",

    "the @xmath17-band light curves reached the maximum magnitude at @xmath13 d.    the rising part of the light curves exhibited the slow evolution which was similar to those of sne 1998bw , 2008d , and 2012au ( see the upper panel of figure 7 ) .",

    "the decline rate of sn 2016coi was also similar to those of sne 1998bw , 1999dn , 2008d , and 2012au , but significantly slower than those of sne 1994i and 2009bb .",

    "we suggest the classification of these sn to be ` ib'-bl .",
    "we estimate the kinetic energy and the total ejecta mass of sn 2016coi using the scaling method ( see * ? ? ?",
    "since the light curve shape of sn 2016coi was similar to the stretched light curve of sne 2006aj and 2008d ( see figure 9 ) , we use these objects as references .",
