    "investigating the stability of multiquark hadrons have been pursued in various models after jaffe suggested the possible existence of such particles in qcd  @xcite .",
    "the observation of many charmonium - like states , such as @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and of heavy pentaquark states@xcite revived great interest in the studies of multiquark hadrons and/or of molecular bound states containing heavy quark hadrons .",
    "additionally , a new particle , called @xmath4 was recently observed by the d0 collaboration in the @xmath5 invariant mass spectrum with 5.1@xmath6 significance  @xcite .",
    "@xmath4 may be the first observed tetraquark which has four different flavors : up , down , strange and bottom . if all the flavors are different , for any typical two body interaction , one can always find the most attractive combination so that one has advantage to form a bound multiquark state .",
    "the stability of the dibaryons with heavy quarks were studied already in several models ; those based on chromomagnetic models  @xcite and chiral constituent quark model  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , huang et al . studied @xmath7-like dibaryon states containing heavy quarks instead of strange quarks within the framework of the quark delocalization color screening model  @xcite .",
    "dibaryons within the diquark models with heavy quarks are also considered  @xcite .",
    "most of the models studying the possible existence of dibaryons are looking at the most attractive color spin interaction channel@xcite .",
    "for example , for the @xmath7 dibaryon , the attraction in the color spin interaction is larger than those coming from two @xmath8 s , which is the most attractive two baryon channel that the dibaryon can decay .",
    "however , it should be noted that whether such attraction really leads to a stable compact dibaryon states is determined by whether the attraction is strong enough to overcome the extra repulsion coming from bringing all the quarks together into a compact configuration .",
    "as we will discuss later , the magnitude of each effect depends on the masses of the quarks involved that can only be systematically studied within a complete model that consistently treats the kinetic terms and the interaction terms within one framework .    in this work , to investigate the subtle interplay between the two competing effects , in a simple but consistent model , we will study the stability of @xmath9 dibaryon using variational method in a constituent quark model .",
    "this is a generalization of h - dibaryon to include one heavy quark so that it contains the most attractive color - spin interaction channel but at the same time , reduced kinetic energy from combining six quarks in a compact configuration . in particular , we focus our attention on @xmath0 because the states with lowest isospin are most attractive bound for a given quark system  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we will demonstrate how to consistently construct the color spin flavor wave functions that contains the @xmath9 quarks .",
    "there are two ways of constructing the wave function of dibaryon with one heavy quark .",
    "first , we can directly construct the color and spin wave function of dibaryon starting from the four possible su(3 ) flavor state .",
    "or we can consider the color and spin state of @xmath10 and then construct the wave function of dibaryon by adding one heavy quark .",
    "we show the two approaches lead to identical wave functions , showing the consistency of our approach .",
    "technically , the second approach is more convenient to obtain the wave function compared to using the first approach , because the former utilises clebsch - gordan coefficients of @xmath11 while the second approach uses that of @xmath12 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first present the hamiltonian and calculate the masses of baryons to determine the fitting parameters of the model in sec.[section2 ] . in sec.[stability ] , we explain why we choose the dibaryon with one heavy flavor in terms of the relation between hyperfine potential and the stability condition . in sec.[section3 ] , we construct the spatial wave function of the dibaryon . in sec.[section4 ] , we classify @xmath10 with su(3 ) flavor symmetry and construct the color and spin wave function of dibaryon using the first method . in sec.[section5 ] , we construct the color and spin wave function of dibaryon using the second method . in sec.[section6 ] , we calculate the wave function of dibaryon and show that their results are the same in both methods . in sec.[section7 ] , we represent the numerical results obtained from the variational method , and finally summarize the results in sec.[section8 ] .",
    "the appendices include some details of the calculations .",
    "we take a nonrelativistic hamiltonian with the confinement and hyperfine potential given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 s are the quark masses , and @xmath15 are the color operator of the @xmath16th quark for the color su(3 ) , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the confinement and hyperfine potential , respectively . @xmath19 the hyperfine term which effectively splits the multiplets of baryon with respect to spin is expressed as @xmath20 here , @xmath21 is the distance between interquarks , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are chosen to depend on the masses of interquarks given by @xmath24 we choose to keep the isospin symmetry by requiring that @xmath25=@xmath26 . in the hamiltonian ,",
    "the parameters have been chosen so that the fitted mass of baryons are comparable with those of experiments .    .",
    "parameters fitted to the experimental baryon masses using the variational method with a single gaussian .",
    "the respective units are given in the third row .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this section , we present the color @xmath28 spin basis .",
    "the clebsch - gordon coefficients of combining the color and spin basis are calculated by using k matrix  @xcite .",
