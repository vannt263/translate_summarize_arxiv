    "a typical _ schubert problem _ asks how many lines in three - space meet four generally chosen lines .",
    "the answer , two , may be obtained by computation in the cohomology ring of the grassmannian variety of two - dimensional planes in four - space .",

    "for this reason , and in order not to frighten the reader , we will use the term `` cohomology '' throughout . )    a modern schubert problem asks how many flags have relative position @xmath7 with respect to three generally chosen fixed flags @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . the solution to this problem , due to lascoux and schtzenberger @xcite , is to compute a product of schubert polynomials and expand in the schubert polynomial basis .",

    "this method extends to schubert problems with more than three flags . to do this",
    ", we use the permutation arrays defined by eriksson and linusson to obtain a table of intersection dimensions .",
    "these permutation arrays are closely related to the checker boards used in @xcite .",
    "eriksson and linusson introduced permutation array varieties as natural generalizations of schubert varieties to an arbitrary number of flags .",

    "for example , their equations are not reduced , so we argue that the `` correct '' generalization of schubert varieties are permutation array _",
    "schemes_. we describe pathologies of these varieties / schemes , and show that they are not irreducible nor even equidimensional in general , making a generalization of the bruhat order problematic .",
    "we also give counterexamples to the realizability conjecture  [ c : realizability ] .",
    "returning to the task at hand , we use the data from the permutation array to identify and solve a collection of determinantal equations for the permutation array schemes , allowing us to solve schubert problems explicitly and effectively , for example allowing us to compute galois / monodromy groups .",

    "<S> using a blend of combinatorics and geometry , we give an algorithm for algebraically finding all flags in any zero - dimensional intersection of schubert varieties with respect to three transverse flags , and more generally , any number of flags . in particular , the number of flags in a triple intersection is also a structure constant for the cohomology ring of the flag manifold . </S>",
    "<S> our algorithm is based on solving a limited number of determinantal equations for each intersection ( far fewer than the naive approach ) . </S>",
    "<S> these equations may be used to compute galois and monodromy groups of intersections of schubert varieties . </S>",
    "<S> we are able to limit the number of equations by using the _ permutation arrays _ of eriksson and linusson , and their permutation array varieties , introduced as generalizations of schubert varieties . </S>",
    "<S> we show that there exists a unique permutation array corresponding to each realizable schubert problem and give a simple recurrence to compute the corresponding rank table , giving in particular a simple criterion for a littlewood - richardson coefficient to be @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we describe pathologies of eriksson and linusson s permutation array varieties ( failure of existence , irreducibility , equidimensionality , and reducedness of equations ) , and define the more natural _ permutation array schemes_. in particular , we give several counterexamples to the realizability conjecture based on classical projective geometry . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we give examples where galois / monodromy groups experimentally appear to be smaller than expected . </S>"
