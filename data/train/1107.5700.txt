    "<S> the position of this minimum yields an estimation of the characteristic decay time . </S>",
    "<S> if the pulse duration exceeds this characteristic time , the vortex core dynamics reaches steady - state before the end of the pulse , i.e. , the pulse duration is uselessly too long . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> if the pulse duration is shorter than this characteristic time , some energy is wasted outside the resonance line . due to the transient response of the vortex core to the excitation pulse , </S>",

    "<S> the damping ratio @xmath36 is itself about three times larger than the gilbert constant , measured from the linewidth in the perpendicularly saturated state of the nimnsb disk and found to be @xmath37 ( see supplementary figure 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between @xmath36 and @xmath7 corresponds to the expected increase due to topological renormalization@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this enhancement is produced by the strongly inhomogeneous spatial distribution of magnetization in the undistorted vortex state compared to the perpendicularly saturated state . </S>",
    "<S> our experimental results of fig.2 give a quantitative estimation of the damping ratio @xmath30 for the vortex distorted by large oscillations@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in a further step , it would be interesting to evaluate how much of the observed increase of @xmath30 against @xmath36 is due to topological renormalisation between the distorted and undistorted vortex states . as can be seen in fig.2e , </S>",

    "<S> , the gyrotropic motion is forced at the pulse frequency , while in the free decay regime , the core oscillates towards its equilibrium position at its natural frequency , therefore acquiring a phase shift with respect to the excitation carrier . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency of the second pulse to drive the vortex core to the reversal threshold , which is estimated out of ten attempts in fig.3 , depends on the microwave frequency and on the delay between pulses in an oscillatory manner ( the oscillation period scales as the inverse frequency detuning ) .    to illustrate further this effect of coherence , similar experiments with a @xmath43 phase shift introduced between the two pulses </S>",
    "<S> have been carried out . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the regions where successful reversal are observed in figs.3c and 3d are complementary to those in figs.3a and 3b , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> thus , phase control of the microwave excitation can trigger vortex core switching .    using the same approach as before </S>",
    "<S> , it is possible to calculate numerically such experimental phase diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> an excellent agreement with experiments is achieved , as can be seen in fig.4a . in fig.4b , we have plotted the calculated vortex core trajectory and velocity as a function of time corresponding to two consecutive @xmath18 pulses at @xmath44  mhz separated by a 60  ns delay . in the top graphs , </S>",
