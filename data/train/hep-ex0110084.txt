    "the physics of the differences between quark and gluon jets continuously attracts an interest of both , theorists and experimentalists .",
    "hadron production can be described by parton showers ( successive gluon emissions and splittings ) followed by formation of hadrons which can not be described perturbatively .",
    "the gluon emission , being dominant process in the parton showers , is proportional to the colour factor associated with the coupling of the emitted gluon to the emitter .",
    "these colour factors are @xmath0 when the emitter is a gluon and @xmath1 when it is a quark .",
    "consequently , the multiplicity from a gluon source is ( asymptotically ) 9/4 higher than from a quark source .    in qcd calculations ,",
    "the jet properties are usually defined inclusively , by the particles in hemispheres of quark - antiquark ( @xmath2 ) or gluon - gluon ( @xmath3 ) systems in an overall colour singlet rather than by a jet algorithm .",
    "in contrast to the experimental results which often depend on a jet finder employed ( _ biased _ jets ) , the inclusive jets do not depend on any jet finder ( _ unbiased _ jets ) .",
    "as a consequence of the greater radiation of soft gluons in a gluon jet compared to a quark jet , gluon jets are predicted to be broader . an experimental confirmation of this effect is shown in fig.[jet_width ] where the fraction of a jet s visible energy close to the jet axis is larger for quark jets than for gluon jets .",
    "all the qcd - based models describe the data very well .",
    "the predicted larger soft gluon emission in gluon jets compared to quark jets has been confirmed by an observed difference between the hadron multiplicity in quark and gluon jets where the latter are found to be higher , as can be seen for example in fig.[multipl ] @xcite . only unbiased jets ( here @xmath4 ) defined by particles found in the event hemispheres were used .",
    "the hemispheres are defined by the plane perpendicular to the principal event axis .",
    "there is a large theoretical interest in the ratio of the mean multiplicity of gluon and quark jets , @xmath5 .",
    "this is predicted to be equal to the ratio @xmath6 if the asymptotic condition @xmath7 is fulfilled . in real experimental conditions ( @xmath8 finite ) , the satisfaction of this condition is approached by taking only soft particles into account @xcite . in @xcite soft particles in unbiased gluon and quark jets ( @xmath9 gev ) were defined by momenta @xmath102.0 gev . in order to reduce the hadronization effects ,",
    "transverse momenta of particles relative to the jet axes were required to be higher than 0.8 gev , yielding @xmath11 which agrees with the asymptotic value .",
    "the corresponding herwig results for @xmath12 gev were found to be in a good agreement with the measurement .",
    "moreover , for asymptotic @xmath13 tev , herwig yielded @xmath14 , while jetset set to have @xmath15 gave @xmath16 . exploiting all the particles from finite energy jets",
    "leads to a reduced value of @xmath17 compared to the asymptotic one .",
    "the measured value 1.51@xmath180.04 from @xcite is in excellent agreement with qcd calculations of this quantity @xcite .      adopting a recently proposed method for obtaining the scale dependent unbiased gluon jet multiplicity , @xmath19 @xcite , the ratios of multiplicities , @xmath17 , of slopes , @xmath20 and of curvatures , @xmath21 , defined as + @xmath22 were recently measured @xcite and compared to recent qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "the method is based on a nlo expression for @xmath23 : @xmath24 \\label{nglu } \\vspace*{-0.2cm}\\ ] ] @xmath25 \\label{ngle}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the inclusive multiplicity in 2-jet @xmath3 system and @xmath26 is the exclusive multiplicity in 2-jet @xmath2 events with no gluon radiation harder than @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 is the multiplicity of e@xmath29e@xmath30 3-jet events .",
    "the two expressions for @xmath23 reflect the ambiguity in the definition of the gluon jet @xmath31 with respect to the @xmath2 system when the gluon radiation is hard .",
    "the scales @xmath27 and @xmath32 are proportional to + @xmath33 with @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 and @xmath39 the 4-momenta of the @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 specifies the e@xmath29e@xmath30 c.m .",
    "energy ( @xmath43 ) and @xmath44 the energy of the @xmath2 system in the @xmath2 rest frame .",
    "note that the gluon jet terms depend on a single scale which corresponds to the unbiased jets , whereas the quark jet terms depend on two scales accounting for the bias in quark jet multiplicity due to the jet finder criteria used to select the @xmath45 events .    in order to obtain @xmath23 , two event samples with jets found by durham , cambridge and luclus jet finders were used . in the first sample , 3-jet light quark ( uds ) events from @xmath46 decays were kept . after energy ordering",
    ", the jet 3 , having the lowest energy , is taken to be the gluon jet .",
    "this fact together with the condition @xmath47 ( the angles between the jet 1 and the other two are roughly the same , so called `` y events '' ) leads to a low sensitivity to gluon jet mis - identification . for y events , the quantities depend only on @xmath43 and one inter - jet angle , which was conveniently chosen to be @xmath48 .",
    "the measurement of @xmath49 and @xmath32 is shown in fig.[yevents ] .",
    "+    in the second sample , @xmath50 from eq.[nglu ] was directly measured as a mean multiplicity of 2-jet uds flavour events from @xmath51 decays ( @xmath52 ) fixed ) .",
    "note that @xmath53 can not be directly measured since @xmath44 , unlike @xmath42 , is variable , so a direct measurement relevant for this analysis would require c.m .",
    "energies below the @xmath51 . instead",
    ", the biased @xmath54 is determined from measurements of the unbiased @xmath54 , using a nlo expression from @xcite .",
    "+    ( 0,0)(0,0 ) ( -20,175)*preliminary *    fig.[ngg ] shows that the results for @xmath23 using the directly measured biased 2-quark jet multiplicity at lund definition of @xmath55 are found consistent with the direct cleo @xcite and opal @xcite measurements and with mc predictions ( fig.[ngg](a ) ) as well as with the result using the calculated @xmath50 ( fig.[ngg](b ) ) . on the other hand , using the leningrad definition of @xmath55 , the results ( fig.[ngg](b ) ) are inconsistent with mc predictions ( found to have been accurate for @xmath26 and @xmath23 in many other studies ) and also with direct cleo ( and possibly opal ) measurements .",
    "these observations show a clear preference of the results based on eq.[nglu ] using @xmath27 over those based on @xmath32 .    in fig.[rr1r2 ]",
    "the data are compared to various qcd calculations @xcite . for the predictions of @xcite",
    "we observe that at 30 gev , @xmath17 and @xmath20 exceed the data by about 20 and 6% , while @xmath21 agrees with the data .",
    "this suggests that higher order corrections are smaller for @xmath21 than for @xmath20 and for @xmath20 than for @xmath17 .",
    "the data also confirm the prediction @xmath56 .",
    "for the predictions of @xcite we observe a better agreement than @xcite for @xmath17 and a similar agreement for @xmath20 .",
    "the predictions of @xcite are in good overall agreement with the data , however , it should be noted that these predictions are not entirely independent of the data .",
    "the differences between quark and gluon jets manifest themselves also in the fragmentation functions , defined as + @xmath57    ( 0,0)(0,0 ) ( 180,355)*preliminary *    in @xcite the quark and gluon fragmentation functions have been measured in udsc flavour general as well as in y 3-jet events using durham and cambridge jet finders .",
    "the scale in these cases is not unambiguously defined but it should depend on @xmath8 and the event topology",
    ". studies of hadron production in events with a general topology have shown that the characteristics of the parton cascade depend mainly on the hardness of the process producing jets @xcite + @xmath58 and accordingly , the scale in this analysis was put @xmath59 .    in fig.[ffincl ] the inclusive quark fragmentation function is compared to the gluon one .",
    "the latter is observed to be softer which can be explained by the fact that the radiation of soft gluons is larger for gluon jets and that gluon can not be present as a valence parton inside a produced hadron ( first splitting @xmath60 has to occur ) .",
    "the scale dependence of the quark and gluon fragmentation functions is presented in fig.[ffscal ] .",
    "the figure on the left contains a summary of quark jet fragmentation function measurements .",
    "a good correspondence between the biased and unbiased measurements suggests that @xmath61 is a meaningful choice of scale for a general 3-jet topology .",
    "the figure on the right shows the scaling violations of the biased gluon jets which are stronger than for quark jets .",
    "this is due to the fact that the scale dependence of the fragmentation functions for gluons is dominated by the splitting @xmath62 , while that for quarks is dominated by the splitting @xmath63 .",
    "shown examples of differences between quark and gluon jets underline the key role of the inequality @xmath64 .",
    "its consequences , namely larger widths and multiplicities as well as softer fragmentation function with stronger scaling violations of gluon jets with respect to quark jets have been confirmed experimentally .",
    "a new method for the indirect measurement of unbiased @xmath23 from biased @xmath28 and @xmath26 was described and its usefulness proven .",
    "the results for @xmath23 based on @xmath27 agree significantly better with previous measurements and mc predictions than the results based on @xmath32 .",
    "an overall conclusion is that the theory is in general agreement with the experimental results ."
