    "real function _ usually represented as a sum of monomials in powers of the @xmath20 , @xmath49 with real coefficients @xmath50 . in the quantum case",

    "as is common with statistical integrals , the variational approximation will be developed on the basis of the inequality , cf .",

    "the resulting @xmath63 can then be adopted as an approximation for @xmath39 with which one should calculate the relevant correlators . as always with variational methods ,",
    "it is hard to assess the accuracy of the approximation . here",

    "below ) as the variational space , by comparing ( where available ) with exact analytical results or with monte carlo simulations .",
    "freeness is a concept recently developed in the mathematical literature associated with noncommuting random variables @xcite .",
    "while freeness is abstractly defined without reference to a specific realization of the random variables , in the context discussed here , namely in relation to large-@xmath3 hermitian multi - matrix models , it essentially means that the weight @xmath64 according to which the matrices are distributed contains no bias with respect to the relative @xmath65 `` orientations '' of the matrices . in terms of the decomposition @xmath66 with diagonal @xmath67 and unitary @xmath68",
    "this means that the action @xmath39 in the free models depends only on the @xmath67 .",
    "consequently all the angular integrals in any given correlation function are weighted only with the group theoretical @xmath7 haar measure and give universal results independent of what the action is .",
    "the remaining integrals over the @xmath67 in the large-@xmath3 limit are controlled by the saddle point of the effective action which includes the contribution from the vandermonde determinants for each @xmath69 , cf .",
    "examples below . as a consequence of these properties",
    "all correlation functions for free multi ",
    "matrix models are systematically accessible in terms of the _ moments of individual matrices _ through the recently developed techniques , as will be elaborated upon below , cf .",
    "also refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a family of noncommuting random variables @xmath20 is called free if and only if @xmath70 where @xmath71 ( and @xmath72 is identified with @xmath73 ) .",
    "note that the bracket notation introduced here following @xcite means taking the expectation value of the trace of the expression inside , divided by @xmath3 . in order to evaluate a general correlation function @xmath74",
    ", one can use @xmath75 and multiply out the terms in the expectation value .",
    "this recursively determines correlation functions of a certain order in terms of lower - order correlation functions until one arrives at an expression containing only _ the moments of the individual matrices_. for two free matrices @xmath76 and @xmath77 this algorithm yields , e.g. , @xmath78    building on this information , it has been possible , e.g. , to determine , @xcite , how the eigenvalue distributions of matrices which are free with respect to one another are additively and multiplicatively convoluted .",
    "freeness in matrix models is a slightly more general concept than what is usually meant by the term `` independent matrix model '' , in which the potential governing the distribution of the matrices is a sum of terms for each individual matrix .",
    "independent matrix models are certainly free ; however , so is e.g. a two - matrix model with potential @xmath79 more generally , the potential of a free matrix model can be any function of traces over functions of the individual matrices .",
    "such more general free matrix models are almost as easy to solve as the independent ones .",
    "this is best illustrated by an example .",
    "consider the model described by ( [ freex ] ) .",
    "after the transformation of variables @xmath80 , with diagonal @xmath19 and unitary @xmath21 , the potential @xmath81 depends only on the @xmath19 .",

    "@xcite,@xcite @xmath86 the constants @xmath87 and @xmath88 can now be determined by the self - consistency conditions @xmath89 including such self - consistency conditions on selected moments of the matrices is the only additional step needed compared with solving independent matrix models .",
    "knowledge of the eigenvalue distributions @xmath90 is sufficient to calculate any correlation function since the latter can be reduced using eq .",
    "( [ algo ] ) to a sum of products of individual moments , i.e. to the integrals @xmath91 .",
    "it was argued e.g. in refs .",
    "@xcite,@xcite that a free behaviour of the matrix variables representing physical degrees of freedom may capture correctly the main features of the dynamics in the large-@xmath3 limit of nonabelian gauge theories .",
    "this hope and the wealth of available analytical techniques presented above render the space of free matrix models a good candidate for variational calculations .",
    "the main idea of the present approach is to choose the optimal action @xmath63 in the variational principle ( [ minp ] ) from among all actions which leave the matrices in terms of which @xmath39 is given , free with respect to one another .      in making a variational approximation based on free matrix models one must first decide which combinations of the original matrix variables @xmath20 will be assumed to be free , i.e. in which variables to formulate the exact action @xmath39 .",
    "one should realize that e.g. free @xmath76 , @xmath77 do not imply free @xmath92 , @xmath93 nor vice versa ( more about this below ) .",
    "the second step is to find the best trial action @xmath63 which is free in the variables one has settled for .",
    "in this subsection , the solution of the second step is addressed .",
    "in other words , consider @xmath94 to be _ free in terms of the original _ @xmath20 . under this limitation , it is possible to give a _ general recipe _ for finding the trial @xmath63 which minimizes the right hand side of ( [ minp ] ) .",
    "for this it is useful to introduce the following algorithm . given a trace of any function of matrices @xmath20 , @xmath95 , write down its expectation value in terms of the moments of the individual matrices under the assumption that the matrices are free with respect to one another .",
    "this is easily accomplished for any multinomial expression using eq .",
    "( [ algo ] ) .",
    "now rewrite the resulting expression with @xmath96 replaced by tr@xmath97 .",
    "this defines what will be called the `` free partner '' @xmath98 of @xmath99 ( the `` liberated '' @xmath99 , so to speak ) .",
    "for instance , the free partner of @xmath100 is @xmath101 cf .",
    "( [ m1m2e ] ) .",
    "evidently , the original function and its free partner have the same expectation values when evaluated in any free matrix model for the @xmath16 ( note that the expectation values of the products of traces appearing in the free partner factorize at large @xmath3 ) . in general , the two expectation values will of course differ . furthermore ,",
    "if the free partner @xmath102 of any action @xmath39 is used as a trial action , it will generate a free matrix model ; hence the terminology .    with the help of the above definitions , one can give the general solution of the minimization principle ( [ minp ] ) in the space of matrix models which are free in terms of the variables @xmath16 .",
    "the crucial observation is that , when @xmath94 is to be chosen from among all free actions , the original action @xmath39 and its free partner @xmath103 lead to the same minimization problem , i.e. identical right hand sides of eq .",
    "( [ minp ] ) , since @xmath104 by construction for any free @xmath63 , as mentioned above . however , the minimization problem for @xmath103 is trivial to solve : since @xmath103 itself describes a free matrix model , the best approximation to @xmath103 in the space of free actions is @xmath105 itself . since the approximation to @xmath39",
    "is governed by the same minimization problem , @xmath105 is at the same time the best free approximation to @xmath39 .",
    "this result provides a general solution of the minimization problem in the space of matrix models which are free _ in terms of the original variables _ @xmath16 .",
    "note that the solution @xmath106 of the minimization problem defines a type of mean field approximation to the exact action @xmath39 .",
    "interaction terms in @xmath39 which are sensitive to angular correlations between the different matrices are replaced by terms in which each matrix couples only to selected moments of the other matrices , i.e. to some mean properties independent of the angular orientations .",
    "this is entirely analogous to the standard development of the hartree or hartree - fock mean field theories from a variational principle using the space of ( properly symmetrized or antisymmetrized ) product states .",
    "there , in second - quantized language , the combinations in which the mean field enters the single - particle hamiltonian are determined by wick s theorem ; here , in complete analogy , the combinations in which the moments enter the free partner are determined by the free random variable axioms as encoded in eq .",
    "( [ algo ] ) .",
    "in fact , ( [ algo ] ) is nothing but wick s theorem generalized from the usual bosonic and fermionic cases to the case of objects obeying the cuntz algebra ( this is the algebra obeyed by the fock space operator representation of free variables , cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the idea of the present variational approach was stated as choosing the optimal action @xmath94 from among all matrix model actions which leave the matrices in terms of which @xmath39 is given , free with respect to one another . in this",
    "there exists an additional freedom of choice which will now be exploited , namely the choice of matrix variables in terms of which @xmath39 is given , i.e. in terms of which one develops the mean field approximation by constructing the free partner @xmath106 . up to now",
    ", only a fixed set of variables was considered  the original @xmath16 . however ,",
    "if one rewrites the action @xmath39 in terms of other variables , @xmath107 and again looks for the optimal free action , now in terms of the new variables @xmath108 , approximating @xmath109 , one may find a better approximation than the one found using the variables @xmath16 .",
    "it should be emphasized that free @xmath108 in general do not imply free @xmath16 nor vice versa .",
    "therefore , the accessible variational space using free matrix models is in fact much larger than was apparent in the last section . by allowing different sets of variables in which to formulate the problem to be approximated",
    ", one can even include into the variation models in which the original matrices @xmath16 are not free with respect to one another .",
    "to formalize this idea , it is necessary to reexamine the derivation of the variational principle ( [ minp ] ) . carrying out a variable transformation @xmath110",
    ", one has @xmath111",
    "e^{-n^2 \\tilde{s } [ b_j ]   + \\ln j [ b_j ] } \\ge \\exp \\left [ - ( f_0 + n^2 \\langle \\tilde{s } -   ( \\ln j)/n^2 -s_0 \\rangle_{s_0 } ) \\right]\\ ] ] i.e. @xmath112 with the jacobian ( which must be non - vanishing to have a legitimate change of variables ) @xmath113 } { d\\mu [ b_j ] } \\right|\\ ] ] note that this is the determinant of a @xmath114 matrix , where @xmath115 denotes the number of matrix variables .",
    "now , one can use the theorem of the previous section with the immediate result that the optimal free choice of @xmath94 in the new variables is the free partner of @xmath116 .",
    "thus , while for any given set of variables , the optimal @xmath94 is known , one may now try to further improve the approximation ( i.e. diminish the right hand side of ( [ linv ] ) ) by trying different sets of variables leading to different @xmath109 and @xmath117 .    in general",
    ", this is technically difficult , since @xmath118 is not a multinomial expression , for which the algorithm of finding the free partner is easiest to carry out .",
    "therefore , in this paper the treatment will be specialized to linear transformations , @xmath119 then @xmath120 is independent of the matrix variables @xmath108 .",
    "this greatly simplifies the treatment of ( [ linv ] ) ; the jacobian does not play any role in the determination of the optimal free action @xmath94 for given new variables @xmath108 and thus the best free approximation @xmath94 to the given @xmath109 is the free partner @xmath121 of @xmath109 . using furthermore that @xmath122 , one arrives at the residual minimization problem @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the free energy associated with @xmath121 .",
    "it now remains to try different choices of @xmath125 , leading to different @xmath109 , @xmath121 , and finally @xmath124 , such as to minimize the right hand side of ( [ linvs ] ) .      before actually carrying out the minimization procedure ,",
    "it is convenient to clarify a technical point concerning the actual evaluation of @xmath126 given @xmath127 .",
    "the best way to achieve this seems to be the following . by subtracting a constant @xmath128 , independent of @xmath129 , from both sides of ( [ linvs ] ) ,",
    "one arrives at the equivalent problem of minimizing @xmath130 . for @xmath128",
    ", one can choose a reference free energy , preferably of an independent matrix model with the same number of variables as @xmath39 and whose potential @xmath131 is a polynomial of the same degree as @xmath39 .",
    "this specification is not necessary , but convenient from the point of view of keeping the expressions one deals with in practice as regular as possible . in many applications , @xmath132 is adequate",
    ". then one can write @xmath133 e^{-n^2 \\tilde{s}_f[b ] }   + \\ln \\int \\prod_j d\\mu[b_j ] e^{-n^2 v_{ref } [ b ] } \\nonumber\\\\   & = & \\left .",

    "while the case of one quantum mechanical matrix discussed in the previous section is amenable to exact treatment @xcite due to its special form , an analogous solution is not possible once more than one quantum mechanical matrix is involved . on the other hand , the approximate variational approach , using discretized time ,",

    "this trivial freedom should be removed in order to obtain stable monte carlo results ; otherwise , the system just performs a random walk in the trace of the matrices .",
    "thus , the @xmath321 here are constrained to be traceless , i.e. the condition @xmath322 , assumed to be realized dynamically in prior examples , is enforced by hand .",
    "the free partner to ( [ sq2def ] ) in the original basis is @xmath323 ( using @xmath324 ) . on the other hand , in the fourier basis @xmath325 with @xmath269 as in ( [ umat ] ) ,",

    "this is different from the one - matrix case , where assuming the original variables to be free merely implied decoupling variables at different time slices , which certainly should become exact for large coupling @xmath30 . in the two - matrix case , by contrast , there is still an additional truncation at every time slice which prevents convergence to the exact problem at large @xmath30 . in light of this",

    "ultimately , though , one would expect a local treatment , which assumes different time slices to be free with respect to one another , to provide better agreement at high @xmath30 if it manages to well approximate the commutator interaction .",
    "this is precisely what is not achieved if the original variables are assumed to be free . on the contrary ,",
    "a nontrivial mixing of the variables @xmath354 and @xmath355 at every time slice is necessary such as to better accomodate the commutator - type interaction in ( [ sq2def ] ) .",
    "note that linear combinations of @xmath354 and @xmath355 will not effect any improvement , since the commutator is invariant under such linear transformations ( up to trivial rescalings of the variables ) .",
    "it is disappointing that precisely this phenomenologically very interesting type of interaction term seems particularly resistent to free approximation combined with linear transformations . here",
    ", it seems that using ( technically more complicated ) nonlinear variable transformations must be contemplated in order to capture the essential angular correlations .",
    "note also that the commutator term in the action on its own does not confine the eigenvalue distributions of the involved variables to a compact support , even if one enforces tracelessness ; the eigenvalues can become arbitrarily large if the matrices are located in the regions of configuration space where they commute .",
    "this pathology however seems to disappear ( according to monte carlo experiments carried out by the authors ) when more than two matrices are involved ( i.e. a higher - dimensional yang - mills type of action ) .",
    "presumably there , the regions of configuration space where all the matrices commute are too small compared with the whole space such that entropy suppresses configurations with arbitrarily large eigenvalues .",
    "in this work , a new variational approach to interacting large-@xmath3 multi - matrix models was developed .",
    "the partition function was approximated using the variational principle @xmath356 with @xmath94 initially taken from the space of all matrix models which are free in the set of variables the original interacting problem is given in .",
    "it turned out to be possible to give a general solution to this variational problem for a fixed set of matrix variables in terms of the concept of the `` free partner '' introduced by the authors .",
    "the free partner defines a type of mean field approximation to the original action and is constructed using the axioms of freeness in a fashion analogous to the construction of more conventional mean field theories for fermionic or bosonic particles using wick s theorem .",
    "the freeness axioms constitute the analog of wick s theorem for objects obeying the cuntz algebra , which is the algebra obeyed by the fock space operator representation of free random variables @xcite .",
    "however , the variational approach presented here goes beyond simply acting as a device to derive a mean field theory . above",
    ", the variational space was characterized as being the space of all matrix models which are free in the set of variables the original interacting problem is given in .",
    "this implies that one can considerably enlarge the variational space by first allowing for a change of variables in the original problem and only then varying over all matrix models which are free in the variables one has settled for . in this way one",
    "includes into the variation models which are not free in the original variables .",
    "every set of variables defines a different mean field theory given by the corresponding free partner .",
    "the variational principle not only allows to derive these mean field theories , but further allows to decide which out of a set of mean field theories provides the best approximation to the exact problem .",
    "a number of examples were considered in order to assess the accuracy of the variational method ; the variational results were compared with monte carlo simulations as well as analytical results , where available . to begin with",
    ", classical two - matrix models described by actions with at most quartic terms were investigated allowing for a general linear transformation of matrix variables .",
    "impressive agreement was observed , except in the case of the action @xmath198 , eq . ( [ s1redef ] ) .",
    "the authors did not attempt to improve the approximation by allowing for nonlinear variable transformations , which may relieve the discrepancy .",
    "classical models with a large number of matrices were considered in which all matrices pairwise interact in the same way .",
    "such models e.g. become relevant when one has managed to decouple the different space - time points of a large-@xmath3 matrix field theory in a large number of dimensions @xmath115 , e.g. in the framework of an eguchi - kawai reduction . among the models considered",
    "was one which reduces to @xmath198 for @xmath246 .",
    "it turned out that the quality of the variational approximation using only the original set of variables improves as @xmath115 rises .",
    "the variational approximation was also considered for the problems of a single and two coupled matrix chains simulating path integrals for one and two quantum matrices .",
    "two discrete choices of free variables , namely the original variables and a fourier basis , were considered . in the single chain case , as expected , for small ( large ) lattice spacing , the fourier ( original ) basis provided the better approximation . in the continuum limit of the one - matrix case ,",
    "good agreement was achieved with the available analytical solution . for two matrix chains coupled via a commutator - type interaction",
    ", the fourier basis provided a better approximation for all couplings ; it also compares quite favorably with the exact monte carlo results for a large range of coupling constants .",
    "however , for very large coupling , one would expect a local basis , constructed such as to capture the angular correlations introduced by the commutator interaction , to ultimately be more appropriate . here , again it seemed that technically more involved nonlinear transformations must be contemplated in order to achieve further progress .",
    "following @xcite , @xcite the one - cut eigenvalue distribution @xmath357 resulting from a hermitian large-@xmath3 one - matrix model in a quartic potential @xmath358 is most easily found by considering the resolvent , @xmath359 where @xmath360 is a polynomial .",
    "@xmath360 , along with @xmath361 , which defines the support of @xmath357 , is fixed by comparing coefficients in the asymptotic behavior of @xmath362 , @xmath363 where @xmath364 is the @xmath352-th moment of the distribution @xmath357 .",
    "one obtains @xmath365 then one can also immediately read off @xmath366 ( where @xmath367 ) , and by expanding @xmath362 in @xmath368 , @xmath369 \\\\",
    "c_4 & = & \\frac{1}{216   a_4 ^ 3 } \\left [ a_2 ^ 4 + 18 a_2 ^ 2 a_4 + 54 a_4 ^ 2 - a_2 ( a_2 ^ 2 + 12 a_4 ) ^{3/2 } \\right ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when @xmath370 , these expressions simplify to @xmath371 i.e. the second moment of the semicircular distribution is one fourth of its square radius .    in complete analogy , one can derive the two - cut solution in the quartic potential .",
    "then , @xmath362 has the form @xmath372 from which one again obtains by comparing coefficients in the asymptotic expansion @xmath373 one can immediately read off the eigenvalue distribution , and the second moment e.g. becomes @xmath374",
    "in order to additively convolute the eigenvalue distributions of two matrices which are free with respect to one another , i.e. to obtain @xmath375 given @xmath376 and @xmath377 , one should go to the corresponding r - transforms @xcite .",
    "these are defined as follows : find the resolvents @xmath378 and @xmath379 as defined in appendix [ appa ] ; then the r - transforms are given by @xmath380 ( here @xmath381 denotes the inverse function , @xmath382 ) .",
    "the r - transforms behave additively , i.e. @xmath383 . in this sense",
    "they are the free analogs of the logarithm of the fourier transform for probability distributions of ordinary commuting random variables .    in the case of matrices governed by a quartic potential @xmath384",
    ", the resolvent has already been given explicitly in appendix [ appa ] ; denoting @xmath385 , one has that @xmath386 satisfies @xmath387 where @xmath361 was defined in appendix [ appa ] . isolating the square root term and squaring the resulting equation leads to a third order equation for @xmath388 ,",
    "@xmath389 it is not necessary to solve this explicitly , since the case of interest here is the case of two identical distributions , i.e. identical r - transforms .",
    "then one has @xmath390 implying @xmath391 however , the equation satisfied by @xmath388 is known , equation ( [ eqforz ] ) , which by inserting ( [ zitow ] ) leads to the equation satisfied by @xmath392 .",
    "since one is actually interested in @xmath393 , one can solve directly for @xmath394 by rearranging ( [ eqforz ] ) in conjunction with ( [ zitow ] ) as a polynomial in @xmath394 , @xmath395 rather than obtaining a cumbersome analytical solution of ( [ eqfory ] ) , the relevant solution was tracked numerically .",
    "this is best done in small steps in along the positive real @xmath396-axis starting from the known asymptotic behavior @xmath397 and using the positivity of the eigenvalue distribution @xmath398 .",
    "the latter is essentially given by the imaginary part of @xmath394 , namely @xmath399 .",
