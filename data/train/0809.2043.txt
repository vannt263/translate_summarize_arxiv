    "a fundamental issue of quantum theory is the question about the reduction of the state - vector , also known as the collapse of the wave - function .",
    "a key problem for establishing a theory of quantum state reduction is the difficulty to get experimental facts for developing and verifying a theoretical approach .",
    "our experimental knowledge about quantum state reduction might be characterized by the following issues :    1 .",
    "the measurement process forces a reduction of the state - vector towards an eigenvector of the operator describing the measurement process .",
    "the reduction probabilities towards these eigenvectors are given by the projection postulate @xcite .",
    "the nonlocal nature of quantum state reduction is demonstrated by bell - type experiments @xcite .",
    "the question how much mass can be involved in a superposition before it decays by state reduction is so far open .",
    "a main problem is to distinguish the real reduction phenomenon from decoherence .",
    "a lower limit how much mass can be involved in a superposition can be estimated from recent experiments demonstrating e.g. quantum superpositions of fullerenes @xcite or superconducting currents @xcite . due to the rare experimental facts about quantum state reduction",
    "a variety of different theoretical approaches were developed in the last decades .",
    "several of them try to explain state reduction by physical mechanisms like e.g. uncertainties of the space - time @xcite .",
    "others , as the grw approach , introduce a spontaneous localization process , without having a concrete physical mechanism in mind @xcite .",
    "parallel to the theoretical activities a lot of experimental proposals were developed benefiting from recent technological progress @xcite . but with none of them it was so far possible to bring more light into the subject .",
    "the concern of this work is to stimulate the research of quantum state reduction by proposing new experiments .",
    "this is done by investigating the idea that state reduction has its origin in a somehow mutual physical interaction between the states of the superposition .",
    "the investigation is done with help of a phenomenological model , which aims at the calculation of reduction probabilities .",
    "the model s approach is to calibrate it for superposition of two states to the projection postulate and then to study its behavior for superpositions of more states .",
    "although the model is explicitly worked out for the disi - penrose approach of gravity - induced quantum state reduction , other approaches for the physical interaction between the states can be plugged into the model as well .    in chapter [ model ]",
    "the phenomenological model is introduced and the disi - penrose approach of gravity - induced quantum state reduction is recapitulated .",
    "the application of the phenomenological model to thought experiments predicts regimes , in which deviant behavior from the projection postulate could be observed . in chapter [ disqm ]",
    "the question is discussed whether the model can explain the reduction behavior of typical quantum mechanical experiments , in which deviations from the projection postulate are not observed so far .",
    "this discussion is based on an analysis of the decay behavior of solid states in a quantum superposition . in chapter [ experiment ]",
    "the question is followed up whether it is possible to verify the predictions of the model with current state of the art technology .",
    "this is done by proposing and analyzing a concrete quantum optical experiment .",
    "chapter [ biology ] gives an outlook on the possible role of quantum state reduction in biology .",
    "finally the approach is analyzed from the view point of quantum non - locality in concrete its consequences for signaling .",
    "in the derivation of the following phenomenological model it is assumed that according to penrose @xcite state evolution can be described by a formal sequence of u- and r - processes , where the u - process is the unitary evolution of the state vector , described e.g. by the schrdinger equation , and the r - process is causing the reduction of the state vector .",
    "furthermore , it is assumed that there exists a statistical process , which triggers the r - processes on quantum superpositions .",
    "this process shall be denoted here as the `` reduction triggering process '' .",
    "the lifetimes of quantum superpositions , predicted e.g. by the disi - penrose approach , are correlated to this process in the following way .",
    "the life - time @xmath0 corresponds to a decay rate @xmath1 by @xmath2 , where the decay rate @xmath1 describes the probability @xmath3 that the reduction triggering process triggers within a given time - interval @xmath4 an r - process ( @xmath5 ) . in the disi - penrose approach the derived decay rate",
    "does not distinguish , whether the superposition decays towards state 1 or 2 .",
    "the basic idea of the following phenomenological model is to introduce a `` direction '' for the reduction triggering process , i.e. to write down separate trigger rates for stimulating a decay of state 1 towards state 2 ( @xmath6 ) and vice versa ( @xmath7 ) . but",
    "before developing the model in detail , the basics of the disi - penrose approach shall be recapitulated .        in the derivation of penrose",
    "the hypothesis of gravity - induced quantum state reduction is a manifestation of the incompatibility of general relativity and the unitary time evolution of quantum physics @xcite .",
    "basic idea can be explained with the thought experiment shown in figure  [ fig : penroseexp ] .",
    "depending on whether the diffracted photon is detected by the detector at the right , a rigid mass inside the detector is shifted by a small distance or not . following the unitary evolution of the schrdinger equation",
    "the system evolves at this experiment into a superposition of two macroscopic states corresponding to the shifted and not shifted mass . according to the theory of general relativity the superposed macroscopic states have slightly different space - time geometries , which means that a clock at the same position runs with slightly different speeds .",
    "penrose argues that due to this the time - translation operator for the superposed space - times involves an inherent ill - definedness leading to an essential uncertainty in the energy of the superposed states , which results finally to a decay of the superposition towards to one of the states . the expression @xmath8 ( @xmath9gravitational constant , @xmath10mass - density distribution of state @xmath11 , @xmath12 dimensionless parameter , which is expected to be in the order of 1 is assumed to be 1 . ]",
    "@xcite ) defines a measure how much the space - time geometries of the states 1 and 2 differ from each other @xcite .",
    "if the superposition consists of a rigid mass at different locations , equation ( [ form : eg12 ] ) expresses the mechanical work , which is needed to separate the masses from each other under the assumption that gravitation acts between them .",
    "the stability of the superposition is expressed by the decay rate @xmath13 or its corresponding lifetime @xmath14 .",
    "a derivation of equations [ form : eg12 ] and [ form : decrate - eg12 ] basing on the argumentation above is given in appendix  [ appendixa ] .",
    "for superpositions of atoms and molecules the disi - penrose hypothesis predicts in consistency to quantum theory extremely long life - times .",
    "lifetimes in the order of seconds are predicted for masses and lengths in the order of the bacterial scale ( microns ) . with current state of the art technology it was so far not possible to study the decay of quantum superpositions involving masses of this order .",
    "concrete proposals for checking the disi - penrose hypothesis were developed by several authors @xcite .    ) in configuration space for the experiment of figure 1 shortly after the photon was detected .",
    "the wave - function is localized at two points corresponding to the states `` photon detected '' and `` photon not detected '' . ]    in the following discussion of the phenomenological reduction model a special representation for the wave - function is used , which is shown in figure  [ fig : configspace ] : this figure shows schematically the distribution of the wave - function in configuration space for experiment  [ fig : penroseexp ] shortly after the photon has reached the detector .",
    "the wave - function @xmath15 describes here always the whole system consisting in the experiment of figure  [ fig : penroseexp ] of photon , aperture and detector .",
    "the configuration space on which the wave - function @xmath15 is defined is given for a many particle system mainly by the positions of all participating particles @xmath16 .",
    "the configuration space shall always be chosen in such a way that a classical state corresponds to a wave - function @xmath15 , which is localized around one point in the space .",
    "the quantum superposition evolving at the experiment of figure  [ fig : penroseexp ] is then represented by a wave - function localized at two well distinguished points corresponding to the states `` photon detected '' and `` photon not detected '' respectively , as indicated at the right of figure  [ fig : configspace ] .",
    "both axis of figure  [ fig : configspace ] ( and the following figures  [ fig : thoughtexp ] , [ fig : transition ] and [ fig : statescell ] ) represent the almost infinite dimensions of the configuration space .",
    "since each point of the configuration space represents a classical state with a well defined mass - density distribution @xmath17 , expression @xmath18 ( [ form : eg12 ] ) can be calculated for each pair of points in the configuration space as indicated in figure  [ fig : configspace ] for state 1 and 2 . by integrating @xmath19 in the surroundings of state 1 and 2 the amount of their amplitudes @xmath20",

    "let s now return to the derivation of the reduction model .",
    "the basic idea of the model is to split the decay rate ( [ form : decrate - eg12 ] ) describing the probability for triggering an r - process into two rates specifying the direction of the decay like @xmath24 under the assumption that the direction of the reduction triggering process determines the final outcome of the experiment , i.e. a triggering of a decay of state 1 towards state 2 ( @xmath25 ) leads finally to a complete vanishing of state 1 and a reduction towards state 2 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 have to be chosen like @xmath27 to calibrate the model to the predictions of the projection postulate . for a quantum superposition of more than two states the trigger rates ( [ form : approachptrigger12 ] ) can be generalized like @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the generalization of expression ( [ form : eg12 ] ) for a pair of states @xmath11 and @xmath30 .",

    "shall be presented : summing all trigger rates ( [ form : approachptriggerij ] ) , which trigger the decay of a certain state @xmath11 , one can define a decay rate for this state as is symmetrical ( @xmath31 ) and that its diagonal elements are vanishing @xmath32 . ] @xmath33 with the definition of the gravitational potential of a state @xmath11 @xmath34 and the normalization @xmath35 , equation ( [ form : pdecayi ] ) can be transformed to @xmath36 where the mean mass distribution and potential are defined by @xmath37 with the approximation that the gravitational self energies of the states are nearly identical(@xmath38 ) expression ( [ form : pdecayiinterpretation ] ) can be simplified to @xmath39 this yields the physical interpretation that the decay rate of a state @xmath11 is given by the energy difference of this state in the mean gravitational potential of the superposition and its own gravitational potential . for a superposition of two states , where @xmath40 is much bigger than @xmath41 , the mean potential is close to the potential of state 1 and",
    "its decay probability is small . for state 2 one",
    "gets a big energy difference and a high decay rate .",
    "consequently the superposition mostly decays towards state 1 .",
    "let s now continue with the calculation of the final outcome of the experiment . from the assumption that the reduction triggering process ( @xmath42 ) induces a reduction stream from state @xmath11 towards state @xmath30 , which might be defined as @xmath43",
    ", it follows that the reduction streams of all other states @xmath44 towards state @xmath30 become also bigger than 0 ( @xmath45 ) , since @xmath46 is bigger than 0 and @xmath47 equals 0 .",
    "since there is a physical interaction between these states described by the matrix element @xmath29 , it is assumed that this net stream from state k towards state j triggers like the reduction triggering process @xmath48 a reduction stream from state @xmath44 towards state @xmath30 .",
    "this means that the initial trigger event determines the final outcome of the experiment . here",
    "the reduction stream @xmath49 becomes so small that later occurring trigger events can overrule the final outcome of the experiment .",
    "this problem of the draft estimations ( [ form : pjexact ] ) and ( [ form : pjapproximation ] ) can be seen , if one studies the transition of a superposition of three states towards a superposition of two states by choosing @xmath50 . here",
    "one will find discontinuities of the reduction probabilities as a function of @xmath51 at @xmath52 .",
    "but to get a first understanding of the model this effect can be neglected . ] . by summing up all trigger rates towards a state @xmath30",
    "one can define a reduction rate for this state describing all trigger events leading to a reduction towards this state like @xmath53 by summing up all scenarios , which lead finally to a reduction towards state @xmath30 , the reduction probability @xmath54 can be calculated like @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the probability that the quantum superposition stays stable till the time @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the time , when the states of the superposition start to separate from each other .",
    "if the time dependencies of all couplings @xmath59 are equal , the calculation of equation ( [ form : pjexact ] ) simplifies to @xmath60 where the proportional constant of equation ( [ form : pjapproximation ] ) can be determined with the normalization @xmath61 .",
    "an important property of the derived model is that the predicted reduction probabilities do not depend on the coherence of the superposed states since @xmath54 in equation ( [ form : pjapproximation ] ) depends only on the amounts of the state amplitudes @xmath62 .",
    "a more general argument for the independence of the reduction behavior from decoherence is simply the fact that the disi - penrose approach predicts state reduction in regimes , where coherence between the states is normally lost . since reduction behavior according to the projection postulate takes place in a regime , where coherence is lost , it is obvious that reduction behavior different from the projection postulate ( predicted by the model ) is also not impacted by decoherence .",
    "let s now turn to the discussion of thought experiments .",
    "at the upper diagram of figure  [ fig : thoughtexp]a an experiment is shown , at which a single photon is split into four beams , where the photon is detected at each beam by the same kind of detector as in figure  [ fig : penroseexp ] .",

    "@xmath64 is zero when the photon enters the mirrors and arrives a constant value after the detector has shifted the position of its mass . by inserting matrix ( [ form : matrixa ] ) into equation ( [ form : pjapproximation ] ) one gets the reduction probabilities predicted by the projection postulate @xmath65 . from equation ( [ form : pjapproximation ] ) one can easily see that the projection postulate is always reproduced , if the couplings @xmath29 between the superposed states are all equal .    at figure",
    "[ fig : thoughtexp]b the experiment of figure  [ fig : thoughtexp]a is modified .",
    "the three lower detectors are replaced by so called `` mass - density distribution conserving detectors '' ( mdd conserving detector ) , which means that these detectors do not change their mass - density distributions during the detection process .",
    "but nevertheless these detectors shall store the information , whether a photon was detected or not , persistently , so that this information can be read after the decay of the superposition has taken place .",
    "this persistent storage of information inside the detector is indicated in figure  [ fig : thoughtexp]b by the switches , which can have the positions `` detected '' and `` not detected '' . in chapter  [ experiment ] the question will be pursued whether it is possible to construct such a mdd conserving detector .",
    "the matrix @xmath29 of the experiment of figure  [ fig : thoughtexp]b is given by @xmath66 \\ ; .\\ ] ] the difference between the coupling matrices of experiments  [ fig : thoughtexp]a and [ fig : thoughtexp]b is visualized in the lower part of figure  [ fig : thoughtexp ] , which shows that in experiment [ fig : thoughtexp]b there are no couplings between the states 2 , 3 and 4 anymore ( @xmath32 ) . with result ( [ form : pjapproximation ] )",
    "the probability for detecting the photon at detector 1 is obtained to be @xmath67 , if the photon intensity is split symmetrically at the mirrors ( @xmath68 ) . for the other detectors one gets @xmath69 .",
    "but since the couplings between the states 2 , 3 and 4 are zero ( @xmath32 ) , it is expected that a triggering of a reduction event form state 1 towards e.g. state 2 causes no reduction stream from the other states 3 and 4 towards state 2 .",
    "furthermore , the initial reduction stream @xmath70 has the effect that @xmath71 and @xmath72 are also bigger than zero and @xmath73 follows @xmath74 and @xmath75 . ] , which induces a decay of state 1 towards the states 3 and 4 as well .",
    "the final result is therefore expected to be a superposition of the states 2 , 3 and 4 . the probability for this superposition is also 0.5 ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "the deviation from the projection postulate for the reduction probability of state 1 ( 0.5 instead of 0.25 ) becomes more dramatic , if one evaluates an analogous experiment with 8 detectors , where seven of them are mdd conserving detectors .",
    "the reduction probability for state 1 is again 0.5 .",
    "the same result is also obtained for experiments with 16 , 32 , 64 etc .",
    "this 50%-rule can also be seen directly from the structure of the couplings ( figure  [ fig : thoughtexp]b ) . here one has six non - vanishing trigger rates ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 ) , which have all the same amount , and where half of them reduce the superposition towards state 1 and the other ones towards the superposition of the other states .",
    "this dramatic change in the reduction behavior provokes questions , which define the guideline of the following chapters .    1 .",
    "why have such significant effects not been observed so far ? or : how far is the proposed model consistent to known experimental results ?",
    "this is the subject of the following chapter .",
    "2 .   how can the predicted behavior of the reduction model been verified by experiments ?",
    "this question is the subject of chapter  [ experiment ] , in which a concrete experiment is proposed .",
    "3 .   does the dramatic increase of the reduction probability towards a distinguished state play a role in nature ?",
    "this question is picked up in chapter  [ biology ] .     for a superposed amorphous solid state on the displacement @xmath83 between the two superposed states . ]",
    "to get an understanding how the proposed reduction model behaves in typical quantum mechanical experiments it is necessary to understand the decay behavior of a solid state in a quantum superposition .",
    "such a quantum superposition occurs e.g. in the experiment of figure  [ fig : penroseexp ] , where the mass inside the detector is shifted by a small distance @xmath83 , depending on whether the photon is detected or not .",
    "the vibration of the nuclei around their fix - positions in a solid state leads to a broadening of the extension of the wave - function @xmath15 in configuration space . at the application of the disi - penrose approach the mass - density distribution @xmath84 in expression ( [ form : eg12 ] ) has to be determined for the broadened wave - function @xmath15 .",
    "this means that the mass - density distribution @xmath84 is approximately given by gaussian distributions around the fix positions of the nuclei , where the mean diameter for the extension of the nuclei @xmath85 is mainly determined by acoustical phonons , which can be estimated with @xmath86(@xmath44 = boltzmann constant , @xmath87 = temperature , @xmath88 = mass of nucleus , @xmath89 = lattice constant , @xmath90 = velocity of the acoustical phonons ) . for iron at room temperature @xmath85 is roughly @xmath91 m . for an amorphous solid state",
    "it is expected that the quantity @xmath18 achieves a constant value after all its nuclei are separated far enough from each other , i.e. for @xmath92 , as schematically shown in figure  [ fig : solidstate ] .",

    "the amount of the microscopic contribution is then just given by the number of nuclei @xmath93 multiplied with the energy @xmath94 to bring a single nucleus in a quantum superposition of spatially far separated states @xmath95 with the approximation that the density distribution of one nucleus inside the sphere with diameter @xmath85 is constant , the energy @xmath94 is given by @xmath96 for 100 g iron at room temperature equation ( [ form : solidmicrcontr ] ) predicts a decay rate of roughly @xmath97s@xmath98 . for small displacements ( @xmath99 )",
    "@xmath18 scales with @xmath83 like ( see figure  [ fig : solidstate ] ) @xmath100 where @xmath101 is roughly 5 . for bigger displacements ( @xmath102 )",
    "a macroscopic contribution has to be added on top of the microscopic one , which has as its physical origin that the center of masses of both states are separated from each other .",
    "this contribution depends on the shape of the solid and the direction of the displacement .",
    "we give two examples : a ) for a long rod with length @xmath103 and diameter @xmath104(@xmath105 ) , which is displaced along its axis , @xmath18 scales for @xmath106 like @xmath107 ( @xmath108 = macroscopic averaged density of the solid ) , where @xmath109 is approximately 5 .",

    ".    for a rod made of 100 g iron ( @xmath111 , @xmath112 ) the macroscopic contribution ( [ form : solidbigdisplace ] ) achieves the same decay rate as the microscopic one ( @xmath113 ) for a displacement of roughly @xmath114 m .",
    "let s now turn to the discussion of typical quantum mechanical experiments .",
    "in figure  [ fig : standardqm ] three different types of experiments are shown . in experiment",
    "a ) the position of a diffracted particle is measured by a detector . according to the discussion of the experiment of figure  [ fig : penroseexp ] the system turns here into a superposition of two states corresponding to the cases `` particle detected '' and `` particle not detected '' , for which the reduction model reproduces per definition ( its calibration ) the projection postulate . in experiment",
    "b ) the particle is detected by a continuous medium , a film .",
    "this case can be treated as follows .",
    "the continuous detection medium can be modeled by an infinite number of small detectors . in this case one",
    "gets an infinite number of superpositions and all off - diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath29 have the same amount , which leads according equation ( [ form : pjapproximation ] ) to the reduction probabilities predicted by the projection postulate .    in experiment c ) the particle is measured by two detectors simultaneously .",
    "here one has a superposition of three states ( state 1 = `` particle detected at upper detector '' , state 2 = `` particle detected at lower detector '' , state 3 = `` particle not detected '' ) .",
    "since the matrix element @xmath18 is in this case twice as big as the other two couplings @xmath115 and @xmath116 , the observation of deviations from the projection postulate should be possible .",
    "but these deviations are difficult to observe : one reason is that the two detectors need a perfect synchronization in time .",
    "the discussion of the decay rates of superposed solids has shown that already very small displacements @xmath83 in the order of @xmath91 m lead to high decay rates in the order of @xmath117s@xmath98 .",
    "the investigation of concrete detectors in the next chapter will show that physical processes accompanying the detection process , as e.g. changing electric fields etc .",
    ", can easily cause displacements of this order and even much bigger ones . therefore , if there is no perfect synchronization in time , the quantum superposition is broken stepwise , where one has at each step only the concurrency of two states , for which the projection postulate is exactly reproduced .",
    "another point is that the ratio between the detection probabilities of the two detectors does not show any deviations from the projection postulate .",
    "only the absolute values of the reduction probabilities are different . but",
    "this difference is small , if the detection zones of the detectors are small compared to the extension of the particle .    in the discussion of further types of experiments",
    "one should keep in mind that not only the detection processes inside the detector , but also its interaction with the environment causes small displacements of solids . to be specific",
    ", this can be the interaction with the detector s power supply or with the device storing finally the measurement result , as indicated for the upper detector of experiment c ) ( figure  [ fig : standardqm ] ) .",
    "therefore the discussion , whether the result of an experiment is consistent to the proposed model or not , requires a detailed analysis of all processes accompanying the detection process .",
    "normally , experimentalist do not care about these processes , which makes a subsequent discussion of experiments difficult .",
    "more clarity , whether the proposed reduction model is correct , can only be achieved by experiments , in which all processes accompanying the detection process are carefully controlled .",
    "such an experiment is proposed in the following chapter .",
    "a and [ fig : thoughtexp]b .",
    "if the piezo control at the bottom is connected by the two switches , the detector is operating in the mdd changing mode , otherwise in the mdd conserving mode . ]",
    "in this chapter the question is discussed to what extent it is possible to verify the predictions of the model with current state of the art technology .",
    "this is done by proposing and investigating a concrete realization for the thought experiments of figure  [ fig : thoughtexp]a and [ fig : thoughtexp]b .",
    "figure  [ fig : detector ] shows the proposed circuit for the photon detector , which can be operated in the mdd conserving and mdd changing mode as well : if the piezo at the bottom is connected by the two switches to the circuit , the detector is operating in the mdd changing mode , otherwise in the mdd conserving mode .",
    "an important strategy of the proposed reduction experiment is that the reduction process itself is part of the experiment and is not induced by an external observation process .",
    "this is realized as follows .",
    "the information about the photon measurement will be stored during the detection process inside the detector and will not be forwarded to an external observer .",
    "sufficient time after the reduction event has taken place the observer can read out the measurement result from the detector . in the circuit of figure  [ fig : detector ]",
    "the photon detection leads to a voltage drop in the lower capacitor , which can be measured afterwards by connecting the voltage meter to the capacitor with help of the two switches .",
    "the photon detection is realized by an avalanche photodiode ( apd ) , which is biased above its breakdown voltage . at this so - called geiger mode",
    "a single photon can generate - by exciting an electron hole pair - an avalanche , which leads to a macroscopic current pulse . in the experiment two characteristics of the apd are important :    1 .   the quantum efficiency , which is the probability to detect the photon .",
    "2 .   the dark count probability , which is the probability to measure a photon without a stimulating photon .",
    "the dark count probability can be reduced significantly by operating the apd in the so - called gated mode @xcite . here",
    "the bias voltage will be kept slightly below the breakdown voltage and raised above the breakdown level only inside a window , at which the photon is expected .",
    "quantum efficiency and dark count probability increase both with the voltage at the apd .",
    "they can therefore not be adapted independently from each other . for an ingaas / inp apd",
    "cooled to 77k combinations of 60% and @xmath118 ( quantum efficiency , dark count probability ) or 10% and @xmath119 are possible @xcite .",
    "the circuit of figure  [ fig : detector ] works now as follows . at the beginning of the measurement",
    "the capacitors will be charged to 36v and 29v respectively , where 29v is below and 36v above the breakdown voltage of ingaas / inp at 77k @xcite .",
    "the switch connects the apd with the upper capacitor . at the time ,",
    "where the photon is expected , the switch changes to the lower capacitor of 36v within a time window of 26ns ( see figure  [ fig : detector ] ) .",
    "if the photon triggers an avalanche , the voltage of the lower capacitor will decrease due to the avalanche current , which will stop after some time . in the mdd changing mode",
    "the voltage drop in the lower capacitor affects also the connected piezo , which in turn shifts the position of the connected rigid mass .",
    "a mdd changing detector using an apd and a piezo for shifting a mass was already realized and used in another context @xcite .",
    "a and [ fig : thoughtexp]b . ]    figure  [ fig : propexperiment ] shows the complete experimental setup , which allows to toggle between the experiments of figure  [ fig : thoughtexp]a and [ fig : thoughtexp]b , by connecting/ disconnecting the piezos of the three lower detectors .",
    "the single photons are generated by short laser pulses of 150ps , which are attenuated by 100db @xcite .",
    "for the ingaas / inp apds a photon wavelengths in the infra red of @xmath120 m is needed @xcite .",
    "the probability that the laser emits exactly one photon ( single photon efficiency ) depends on the attenuation .",

    "the accuracy with which the reduction probability @xmath121 for detector 1 can be measured depends on the number of measurements like @xmath122 , where @xmath123 denotes the number of successful measurements , at which exactly one photon was detected in one of the four detectors . to achieve with a quantum efficiency of the apd of 50% an accuracy of @xmath124 ,",
    "one needs roughly @xmath125 measurements .",
    "the proposed experiment is facilitated by the fact that one has not to care about the coherence of the superposed quantum states since the predicted deviations from the projection postulate are not expected to be sensitive to decoherence ( see chapter  [ model ] ) . in the proposed experiment the trigger rates ( [ form : approachptriggerij ] ) become significant , when the piezo starts to move the mass . here",
    "the coherence between the four superposed states is already lost mainly due to the avalanche currents in the detectors .",
    "we turn now to the decisive question , whether the proposed circuit of figure  [ fig : detector ] can be designed in such a way that it satisfies approximately the requirements of a mdd conserving detector . the decay rate of the mdd conserving detector @xmath126 which is given by @xmath29 between the states `` photon detected '' and `` no photon detected '' has to be significantly lower than the decay rate @xmath127 of the mdd changing detector ( @xmath128 ) . from the discussion in chapter  [ disqm ]",
    "it follows that a decay rate of the mdd changing detector in the order of @xmath129 can easily be achieved .",
    "several physical effects contribute to the decay rate of the mdd conserving detector .",
    "the following effects are only a selection :    1 .",
    "one effect occurring in the capacitor @xmath130 of the circuit of figure  [ fig : detector ] is the compression of its dielectric , which changes slightly due to the voltage drop by the avalanche current . assuming that the avalanche current causes a voltage drop from 36 to 29v one gets for a circular plate capacitor with radius @xmath131=5 cm , a plate distance of @xmath104=0.1 mm and sio@xmath132 as dielectric ( @xmath133 3.7 , compression module @xmath134nm@xmath135 ) , which corresponds to a capacity of @xmath136 nf , a change of the plate distance of roughly @xmath137 m , which is 10.000 times smaller than the extension of the nuclei @xmath91 m . with equation ( [ form : solidsmalldisplace ] ) the contribution of this effect to @xmath138 can be estimated as @xmath139s@xmath98 .",
    "a further effect occurring in the capacitor is due to the changing numbers of electrons on its plates by the avalanche current , which leads to a small change of the mass density of the plates due to the electron s masses .",
    "the contribution of this effect to @xmath138 can be estimated with equation ( [ form : eg12 ] ) as @xmath140s@xmath98 .",
    "3 .   an effect occurring in the resistor @xmath141 of the circuit of figure  [ fig : detector ] is its heating by the avalanche current , which leads via thermal extension to small displacements of the resistor . assuming that the resistor is just a wire of cu ( extension coefficient @xmath142k@xmath98 ) with length @xmath103=10 cm and diameter @xmath104=3 mm , which corresponds to a resistance of @xmath143 , one gets for a discharge of the capacitor ( @xmath136nf ) from 36 to 29v a change in the resistor s length of @xmath144 m , which is 50 times smaller than @xmath91 m . with equation ( [ form : solidsmalldisplace ] ) the contribution of this effect to @xmath138 leads to a decay rate of @xmath145s@xmath98 .",
    "a further effect is caused by the impetus of the photon , which transmits its impetus to the detector , leading to a small movement of the detector and a displacement @xmath83 increasing linearly with time .",
    "the contribution of this effect to @xmath138 is after one second still smaller than @xmath146s@xmath98 .",
    "this first analysis is encouraging since the strongest effect the heating of the resistor is with a decay rate of @xmath145s@xmath98 still 10,000 times smaller than the assumed decay rate of the mdd changing detector @xmath147s@xmath98 .",
    "but nevertheless , a lot of further challenges remain to keep the detector s decay rate sufficient small , as e.g. the engineering of the five electronic switches in the circuit of figure  [ fig : detector ] or to keep the environments contribution to the decay rate of the detector as small as possible .",
    "another aspect for the dimensioning of the experiment is that the lifetime of the mdd conserving detector ( here @xmath148s ) has to be significantly bigger than fluctuations in the reaction times of the apds , which can be defined by the time span between the entering of the photon into the apd and the point in time , at which the avalanche current has reached a certain strength .",
    "measurements of such fluctuations are not known by the author and should be checked for the chosen apds .",
    "b , at which the states 2 , 3 and 4 converge so close in configuration space that they can be treated as one state , as shown at the left part of the figure . ]",
    "an issue which will remain open in this work is the question how far the macroscopic quantum states have to be separated from each other in configuration space so that they can be regarded as separated states in terms of the proposed model and how their separation can be defined .",
    "this issue can be explained with help of the experiment shown in figure  [ fig : transition ] , at which the three mdd conserving detectors of the experiment of figure  [ fig : thoughtexp]b are removed .",
    "this experiment resembles the one of figure  [ fig : configspace ] .",
    "the only difference is that the photon is distributed at three concrete locations instead blurred around the detector .",
    "the states 2 , 3 and 4 are now so close in configuration space that they can be treated as one state ( see figure  [ fig : transition ] ) . for the matrix @xmath29",
    "one has therefore to regard only the concurrency of two states leading to the reduction probabilities of the projection postulate .",
    "hence there has to be a smooth transition of the reduction probabilities of the experiment of figure  [ fig : transition ] towards the ones of the experiment of figure  [ fig : thoughtexp]b depending on the separation of the states . a possible criterion for this separation could be the number of particles participating at the photon detection process combined with the distance the particles are moving at the detection process . for the proposed experiment it is assumed that the electrons moving with the avalanche current from one side of the capacitor to the other cause a sufficient separation of the states .",
    "to sum up , the analysis of the experimental proposal has shown that a verification of the predicted effects should be possible with current state of the art technology .",
    "encouraged by the fact that the reduction behavior of the model is not expected to be sensitive to decoherence the question shall be investigated whether the predictions of the model can play a role in biology .",
    "this investigation is additional motivated by the matter of fact that the disi - penrose hypothesis predicts longer life - times for quantum superpositions in an fluid environment ( as e.g. in a cell ) than for quantum superpositions of solids , which can be explained as follows .",
    "since the particles in a fluid environment will move according to the brownian motion , their wave - function will disperse and be blurred after some time .",
    "consequently the microscopic mass - density distribution will become almost flat and will not have the sharp peaks as in solid states .",
    "therefore the microscopic contribution to the decay rates of solid states @xmath149(see figure  [ fig : solidstate ] ) , which has its origin in the fact that the nuclei of the superposed states have to be separated from each other , plays no role , which should result in bigger lifetimes than in solids .    according to the discussion in chapter  [ model ] the most significant deviation from the projection postulate",
    "is expected for a superposition of many states , from which only one state is distinguished by a different mass - density distribution . in the following",
    "it will be shown that a cell , e.g. a bacterium , can evolve in such a quantum superposition . according to the lwdin two - step model for mutations the modification of a dna molecule",
    "is initiated by a quantum tunneling process of an h - bounded proton between two adjacent sites within a base pair @xcite leading to the generation of a tautomeric form of a dna base ( e.g. keto guanine @xmath150 enol guanine ) . in the second step",
    "the tautomeric dna base can lead at the replication of the dna strand to an incorporation of an incorrect base ( e.g. enol guanine with keto thymine instead of cytosine ) .",
    "after the tunneling of the proton the wave - function of the whole cell consists of two superposed states , which differ from each other by only one base pair in one dna molecule .",
    "but the superposed states will differ much more from each other , when the cells starts to replicate the dna molecule and to produce proteins from it in its ribosomes . according to the disi - penrose hypothesis",
    "the superposition of the cell is at this stage far from the point where a reduction is expected .",
    "note that the evaluation of @xmath18 for a superposed sphere of water with a diameter of 1@xmath151 m , where the two superposed states are separated far from each other , leads to a life - time in the order of seconds .",
    "since bacteria have extensions of this order , the stability of the superposition is expected to be orders of magnitude above this time scale .",
    "the stability of the superposition can reduce significantly , if the protein produced in one of the states is an enzyme that enables the cell to live from a chemical substance ( e.g. lactose ) available in its environment .",
    "this will lead to metabolism between the cell and its environment , which in turn causes movement of masses and therefore leads to a change of the mass - density distribution .",
    "if one assumes that the proton tunneling occurs with a small probability and with a constant rate for all sections of the dna molecule , the amplitude corresponding to the original dna molecule @xmath21 will decrease slightly at each proton tunneling . assuming that the amplitudes of the separated states with the modified dna molecules have all the same amount , their amplitudes are given by @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the number of occurred proton tunnelings .",
    "all the states of the superposition will correspond to different types of produced enzymes , where normally only the state with the original dna molecule will be able to catalyze the chemical substance available in the environment .",
    "the matrix @xmath29 for the superposed states in the cell is visualized in figure  [ fig : statescell ] by connecting lines between the states .",
    "since only state 1 with the original dna molecule leads to metabolism and therefore to a change of the mass - density distribution , all matrix elements are vanishing except the ones between this and all other states .",
    "these matrix elements have all the same amount . from equation ( [ form : pjapproximation ] )",
    "follows that the reduction probability of the superposition towards the original state 1 is given by     for a set of superposed states in a cell by connecting lines between the states .",
    "the state in the centre distinguishes from all others by its mass - density distribution due to the catalysis of a chemical reaction . ]",
    "@xmath154    which means that the probability for the superposition to reduce back to the original `` good state '' ( i.e. the state , which enables the cell to live from the food of its environment ) is almost 100% for big @xmath153 , even if the amplitude @xmath21 has reduced significantly .",
    "the derived model could be suitable to explain the effect of adaptive mutation first observed on escherichia coli bacteria @xcite . a non - fermenting strain of escherichia coli bacteria , which means that this mutant of escherichia coli is not able to live from lactose , shows a significant increased mutation rate of its dna molecules towards a lactose - fermenting mutant , if one changes the food on its agar plate to lactose only .",
    "this mutation effect occurs on non - growing strains , i.e. the bacteria do not replicate themselves during the mutation @xcite .",
    "some attempts were already made to explain this phenomenon by quantum mechanical effects @xcite . with the derived reduction model the explanation of adaptive mutation could be as follows .",
    "if the food on the agar plate of the bacteria strain is changed to lactose , the state with the unmodified dna molecule will not lead to metabolism and consequently to a change of the mass - density distribution anymore .",
    "instead the state with the lactose - fermenting mutant will be distinguished from all other states . from equation ( [ form : pjapproximation ] )",
    "it follows that the reduction probability towards this state is given for big @xmath153 by @xmath155 which leads to a significant non - vanishing probability towards this state , which is for big @xmath153 orders of magnitudes bigger than the probability expected from the projection postulate @xmath65 .",
    "this behaviour might be nominated as `` selective reduction '' since the state that is the best for the survival of the cell gets a strong increased reduction probability .",
    "further ideas , how selective reduction can play a role in biology , were published by the author in reference @xcite .",
    "the following discussion deals the following two issues .",
    "first , it is attempted to define an generalized experimental agenda , which is independent from the specific approach of the phenomenological model and the assumption that the physical couplings are governed by gravity .",
    "it shall base only on the thesis that quantum state reduction has its origin in a mutual physical interaction between the states .",
    "second , the approach is analyzed from the view point of quantum non - locality in concrete its consequences for signaling .",
    "a conclusion , which can be extracted from the analysis of the phenomenological model is that changes of the strengths of the physical couplings between the states should lead to somehow changes of the reduction probabilities .",
    "an experimental agenda verifying this thesis would be characterized at least by the following points :    1 .",
    "superpositions of more than two states have to be investigated ( otherwise condition 2 ca nt be fulfilled ) .",
    "2 .   the coupling strengths between the states have to be chosen significantly different .",
    "it is recommended to compare reduction probabilities of experiments with equal and significantly different coupling strengths as proposed in figure [ fig : thoughtexp ] . beneath gravity - induced quantum state reduction",
    "other theses for the physical origin of the couplings @xmath29 or modifications of the disi - penrose approach should be tested by a modification of the proposed experiments .",
    "this requires to change the mdd conserving detectors of experiment [ fig : thoughtexp]b in the way that they move a rigid mass like the mdd changing detectors but with a time delay @xmath4 after the photon has entered the detector",
    ". this delayed change of the mass - density distribution can impact the measurements result only if the four states are still in a superposition . by measuring changes of the reduction probabilities of experiment [ fig : thoughtexp]b and the modified experiment as function of the time delay @xmath4 it is possible to determine the superposition s life - time and accordingly the coupling strengths . ] .",
    "3 .   the different coupling strengths become relevant in a regime , where the states have already lost their coherence to each other .",
    "experiments fulfilling these conditions were not performed so far .",
    "it is evident to mention that the proposed program should also check for smaller changes of reduction probabilities than predicted by the model .",
    "this requires long measurement times , since the accuracy of probability measurements @xmath3 scales with the number of returns @xmath156 like @xmath157 .",
    "point 3 of the agenda might look for many physicists unusual .",
    "normally it is not expected that quantum effects are further relevant when the states have lost their coherence to each other .",
    "point 3 can simply be justified from the experimental fact that it was so far not possible to observe state reduction at a quantum interference experiment .",
    "therefore state reduction has to take place in a regime , where quantum coherence between the states is already lost .",
    "as already stated the phenomenological model predicts also no dependence of the reduction probabilities from the coherence between the states .",
    "they depend only on the amplitudes of the states ( see equation [ form : pjapproximation ] ) . at the proposed experiment in chapter  [ experiment ]",
    "the four superposed states have also lost their coherence when the rigid mass inside the detectors is moved mainly due to the avalanche currents in the apds .",
    "a question of general concern is whether quantum state reduction by a mutual physical interaction between the states activates signalling via quantum non - locality . from the conclusion that this thesis leads to deviant behavior from the projection postulate one",
    "can easily construct experiments which enable signaling via quantum non - locality .",
    "this shall be exemplarily shown by a modification of the thought experiment of figure [ fig : thoughtexp ] . by removing the upper detector in figure [ fig : thoughtexp ] spatial far from the three lower ones , information can be exchanged between the two locations by changing the modes of the three lower detectors between mdd changing and mdd conserving . by estimating several measurements in the upper detector the mode of the three lower detectors can be determined via the changed reduction probabilities for the upper detector . from the fact that bell - type experiments demonstrate faster - than - light correlations of separated measurements via quantum non - locality of state reduction @xcite follows that the proposed reduction model comes in conflict with faster - than - light singalling .",
    "this follows also , if one interprets the state amplitudes of the phenomenological model @xmath158 as global properties of the system and assumes that these amplitudes change abruptly when the decay of the superposition is trigged .",
    "this does also not change if one takes into account that the state amplitudes @xmath158 might not change abruptly but with a somehow time - dependency .",
    "also the experiments restriction that one can not forward the detector s results instantaneously to an observer but has to wait until the superposition is decayed completely before reading out the detector s result does not change the conclusion .    in this context",
    "the question if of interest whether the proposed reduction model is in conflict with existing proves for the impossibility of signalling via quantum non - locality .",
    "these proves investigate the question whether a measurement on a quantum state can influence the result of an other spatially far separated measurement @xcite . the impossibility of an influence on the second measurement bases on the fact that the measurement operators of the spatially separated measurements commutate with each other @xcite .",
    "these proves can not be applied to the proposed experiments of this work .",
    "here one has not a sequence of two measurements corresponding to two separated state reductions but a single spatially distributed measurement ( state reduction ) .",
    "the question whether state reduction by a physical interaction between the states is generally in conflict with superluminal signalling requires the development of a lorentz invariant reduction model basing on this idea .",
    "the decisive question is , whether this model allows as the presented model deviant behaviour from the projection postulate . if this is the case , the model has to predict for the experiment of figure 3b reduction probabilities , which converge to the projection postulate , if the detectors are far separated from each other .",
    "the development of such a model is going beyond the scope of this paper and should be the subject of further investigations .    to sum up , a careful execution of the proposed experimental program , characterized by the above three issues , which checks reduction probabilities also for small deviations from the projection postulate and tests beneath the gravitational hypothesis further hypotheses for the physical couplings",
    ", will give us a deeper insight into the nature of quantum state reduction .",
    "a negative result would manifest the projection postulate as a fundamental principle of nature .",
    "it would be a hint against the thesis that quantum state reduction has its origin in a physical interaction between the superposed states and show that state reduction is governed by other principles .",
    "a positive result would reveal a new aspect of quantum state reduction and would strongly stimulate further experimental and theoretical research .",
    "equations [ form : eg12 ] and [ form : decrate - eg12 ] for the decay rate of a superposition can be derived with penrose s argument that the time - translation operator of the superposition is ill - defined as follows .",
    "the component @xmath159 of the metric tensor is given in the newtonian limit by @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the gravitational potential .",
    "the derivation of the physical time @xmath0 to the time coordinate @xmath57 ( @xmath162 ) is given by @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the space - time invariant ( @xmath165 ) .",
    "the fuzziness of the energy of state 1 by due to the difference of the time - translation operators of state 1 and 2 can be estimated by @xmath166 and for state 2 analogous @xmath167 the addition of @xmath168 and @xmath168 leads directly to expression [ form : eg12 ] for @xmath18 : @xmath169 the corresponding frequency of the energy fuzziness @xmath170 yields the decay rate @xmath1 of equation [ form : decrate - eg12 ] .",
