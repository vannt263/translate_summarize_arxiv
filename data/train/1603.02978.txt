    "fullerenes are stable carbon molecules with spherical , ellipsoidal or cylindrical hollow shape . the existence of these carbon structures was theoretically predicted by different authors between 1965 and 1975 @xcite , but it was not until 1985 that kroto _",
    "et al . _ observed @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "fullerene molecules , together with graphene and carbon nanotubes , are of considerable interest to researchers from many scientific areas and have multiple possible applications , specially on nanotechnology .",
    "their unique mechanical and electronic properties , such as low weight , high strength , flexibility and thermal stability , make this carbon structures quite suitable for the creation of nano - devices @xcite .",
    "one of the most important features of fullerene molecules is that they can harbor atoms in their interior constituting endohedral compounds , denoted by @xmath4 @xcite , whose main advantage is the isolation of the enclosed atom from its environment .",
    "endohedral atoms can be produced in laboratories @xcite , and many technological applications , such as drugs - delivery agents , molecular containers , hydrogen or lithium storage , are now in development @xcite .",
    "previous research mostly aimed to investigate the shell structure and spectral properties of @xmath7 , in which the enclosed atom is located right at the geometrical center of @xmath6 , and the fullerene molecule is modeled by a short - range spherical shell with an attractive potential @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , for larger fullerene molecules the equilibrium position of the confined atom is no longer the geometrical center of the molecule @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to calculate and describe the physically expected differences between the electronic states of the atom confined by the fullerene cage and their free state .",
    "we focus on the systems @xmath4 , where @xmath8 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath9 .",
    "the chosen @xmath10 isomers were @xmath11 and @xmath12 because they are the only two isomers that have been prepared and characterized as pristine structures @xcite .",
    "each of these fullerene molecules was modeled by a short range shell according to molecule symmetry .",
    "@xmath13 was modeled by a spherical shell , while both @xmath10 isomers were described by an ellipsoidal shell with proper parameters .",
    "the fundamental question underlying our work could be stated in the following way : is the endohedral compound formed by a neutral atom inside a neutral fullerene ( @xmath4 ) , or does the valence electron of the encapsulated atom localize into the fullerene shell , giving rise to a zwitterion - like state ( @xmath5 ) ?    in order to understand the transference of the valence electron to the fullerene cage @xmath14 , we analyze the electronic density , the projections onto free atomic states , and the weights of partial angular waves as a function of the attraction that the fullerene exerts upon the valence electron .",
    "it is important to mention that the short range spherical ( or ellipsoidal ) potential for the fullerene cage is indeed a very simple approach ; even so , this model explains and provides a good description of the system and its properties .",
    "there are plenty of studies of the electronic structure as well as photoionization of @xmath7 where the fullerene molecule is modeled as a spherical short range shell @xcite , which show an excellent agreement with another theoretical studies as well as with the experimental photoionization cross section or electron elastic scattering cross section @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the second section",
    ", we present a complete description of the theoretical method ; the third section is focused on the computation , results and discussion .",
    "finally , our conclusions are given in the fourth section .",
    "in a first step we used the structure of the fullerene molecules to obtain the position of the confined atom as the minimum of the classical @xmath3-body potential as explained in sec .",
    "[ obtained x - position ] .",
    "once the position of the atom is determined , the electronic structure of the enclosed atom is calculated modelling the fullerene as a spherical or ellipsoidal square well according to the symmetry of the fullerene molecule .",
    "we model the interaction between the @xmath15 atom and the carbon fullerene using the non - bonded classical lennard - jones potential with each carbon atom of the @xmath16 .    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the position of the confined atom , @xmath19 the position of the @xmath20-th carbon from ref .",
