    "early universe inflation is considered the physical process behind the generation of perturbations that produce the large - scale structures observed in the universe today as well as the mechanism that solves the main problems of the standard cosmological scenario . as a proposal still lacking a fundamental theory from which it could emerge ,",
    "there is a variety of scenarios which achieve the fundamental aim of inflation in different manners .",
    "current observational results @xcite start to constrain the application of the chaotic inflation scenario @xcite for single - field inflation models .",
    "a variation of chaotic inflation contemplates having only a small amount of accelerated expansion , just enough to solve the causality and flatness problems of the hot big bang model . in this scenario ,",
    "the initial fast - roll dynamics has observational consequences at the larges scales , the physics of smaller scales is determined by the subsequent era of slow - roll inflation .",
    "this setup has been considered to explain the lack of power observed in the lower multipoles of the cmb @xcite .",
    "other works have analyzed initial conditions for this scenario in the context of a preinflationary radiation - dominated universe @xcite and initial conditions for the perturbations different from a bunch ",
    "davies vacuum @xcite .    in previous works @xcite , we proposed a modification of the chaotic inflation scenario also with a limited amount of exponential expansion which is in accordance with recent observations .",
    "our motivation considered the fact that some theories of fundamental physics , including the standard model of particle physics , stop being valid above a certain energy scale . in those cases , applying chaotic initial conditions would imply a complex potential and a decaying inflaton field . by considering an amount of inflation of no more than 50 to 60 @xmath1-foldings of exponential expansion",
    "this situation can be avoided . as a consequence ,",
    "the universe starts out in a kinetic - energy - dominated stage with an inflaton potential which is many orders of magnitude smaller than the planck scale to the fourth , but is real and well defined .",
    "this situation initially causes a violation of the slow - roll conditions at the moment of horizon crossing when perturbations are evaluated , but the universe rapidly joins the attractor ( slow - roll ) regime .    regardless of this initial violation of slow - roll , we based our previous results on the slow - roll expansion .",
    "the aim of this work is to formalize the implementation of this scenario by integrating the mode equations for inflationary perturbations in a way consistent with its initial conditions and find those values that best characterize this scenario in accordance with current data by means of a monte carlo integration .",
    "here we limit ourselves to the @xmath0 potential only , once the the mode integration is carried out correctly , one can consider the application of this scenario to arbitrary potentials .",
    "for the purposes of our work , we need to integrate the mode equations for the cosmological perturbations for scalar and tensor modes .",
    "the fact that this scenario of inflation naturally induces a violation of scale invariance on observable scales , means that we can not approximate the power spectra and higher - order observables by a power law , as doing so would rely on the validity of the slow - roll approximation .",
    "our intention is to obtain the initial conditions that predict values for the power - spectra and spectral indices which are in accordance with current data .",
    "we therefore need to integrate the mode equations numerically and insert this new information into the camb code @xcite to supply it with the spectra and then into the cosmomc code @xcite .",
    "all relevant information on how this is done is provided in the next subsections .      as a first approximation , in this work we still assume homogeneity , isotropy and flatness from the very beginning of inflation .",
    "the equations of motion for the background are then @xmath2 a prime denotes a derivative with respect to the scalar field @xmath3 , a dot means derivative with respect to cosmic time , @xmath4 is the hubble rate , whereas @xmath5 represents the inflaton potential . in this case",
    ", we adopt the notation @xmath6 and @xmath7 gev is the reduced planck mass .    we perform all integrations with respect to the number of @xmath1-foldings @xmath8 , which means for the differential equations that @xmath9    our convention is as follows : @xmath10 , then the inflaton roll downs the potential from right to left and @xmath11 with @xmath12 cosmic time , therefore @xmath13 as @xmath14 .    in what follows , we make use of the horizon flow functions @xmath15 @xcite , developed as a generalization of the slow - roll parameters and defined as @xmath16 @xmath17 refers to the initial hubble rate ( at @xmath18 ) . in the case of single - field inflation models ,",
    "the function @xmath19 represents the ratio of the kinetic energy to the total energy density of the field , @xmath20    in the scenario of inflation being considered , the initial value of the potential is limited to be much less than the planck mass such that : @xmath21 , where @xmath22 represents a scale that bounds the validity of the theory under consideration .",
    "this means that the evolution of the system starts in a stage of kinetic energy domination , which later naturally leads to one of potential energy domination shortly after inflation starts . within this picture , it is valid to consider an initial condition for the function @xmath23 corresponding to a value bigger than 1 , @xcite , but for a stage of kinetic energy domination , an initial condition close to 3 comes out more naturally from eq .",
    "( [ epsilon ] ) , as @xmath24 .      in order to calculate the power spectra",
    ", we need to integrate the equations that describe the evolution for inflationary perturbations .",
    "we follow the notation and conventions of @xcite and write the equations for scalar and tensor modes in the following manner : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is defined in @xcite as a gauge - invariant combination of field and metric perturbations . the comoving wave number @xmath27 is introduced to calculate the power spectra through a fourier expansion .",
    "the quantity @xmath28 is defined as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the scale factor and @xmath31 is conformal time defined as @xmath32 .    as mentioned before , we are integrating all quantities with respect to the number of @xmath1-foldings @xmath8 , in consequence , the perturbation equations are rewritten and integrated as @xmath33u_k^s&=&0 , \\\\",
    "\\nonumber \\frac{d^2 u_k^t}{d n^2}+(1-\\epsilon_1)\\frac{d u_k^t}{dn } + \\left[\\left(\\frac{k}{ah}\\right)^2-f_t(\\epsilon_1)\\right]u_k^t&=&0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 and @xmath35 , writing @xmath36 and @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ etau ] ) in terms of the horizon flow functions ( [ psrpp ] ) .",
    "when perturbations are generated inside the horizon , in the region where @xmath38 , the modes approach plane waves of the form @xcite @xmath39 whereas in the opposite limit , when they are outside the horizon @xmath40 , the solution is @xmath41 .    in our case , in order to set the initial conditions for equations ( [ en ] ) , we need to consider that the system is not in the slow - roll regime and we are actually starting the mode integration from the very beginning of inflation . at this point , we make another approximation which needs to be improved ; we set the initial conditions for the perturbations assuming the bunch - davies vacuum eq .",
    "( [ bd ] ) .",
    "this clearly needs to be reconsidered as it should not be necessarily the case that from the very beginning of inflation the part of the universe on which inflation starts corresponds to the vacuum state of the field when there is kinetic energy domination .",
    "our initial conditions are therefore different from those adopted in @xcite for a similar situation .",
    "we also need to establish a way to determine the value of the first mode to be integrated , the other modes will be generated from this value .",
    "we follow the discussion of ref .",
    "( @xcite ) , section 11 in which a consistent initial condition keeps the terms @xmath42 , and @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ etau ] ) positive at the beginning of inflation .",
    "therefore the minimum value of @xmath27 that we choose is given by the maximum of the initial values between the terms @xmath44 and @xmath45 which are determined by the background initial conditions given by this scenario .",
    "the initial conditions we use for the scalar and tensor perturbations for each mode @xmath27 in terms of @xmath8 are    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     having these situations in mind , one can find either initial conditions that fit the value of the quadrupole and the octopole separately , or increase the value of the initial scale to be considered for the mode integration so that the final output gives less power in the lower multipoles , this would be a complementary way to compensate for the situation mentioned at the beginning of this subsection .",
    "the value of the pivot scale considered in camb does not have any influence in the mode integration , but one can consider varying the value of the first scale to be integrated as long as the equations for the perturbations are well defined .",
    "however , we have not explored further this last situation and its consequences for the inflationary observables and the monte carlo integration .",
    "if one tries the first method , the result is that the upper multipoles are misplaced , this is different from the result found in @xcite where they use a @xmath46 distribution to fit the cmb and different initial values for the scale factor considering a preinflationary radiation dominated epoch .",
    "those initial conditions that enter in the first possibility are listed in figure  [ qp ] .        by keeping the value of @xmath23 fixed and finding the value of @xmath47 that gives the desired result for @xmath48",
    ", we found that as long as @xmath49 , this happened always at a value of @xmath47 that gave the same amount of total inflation .",
    "once @xmath50 we did not find the same effect .",
    "by increasing instead the value of the initial scale to be considered for the mode integration by a factor of 60 , one can reduce the values of the quadrupole and octopole arriving to values as low as 346.7 for @xmath48 and 344.7 for @xmath51 .",
    "the values are the lowest ones obtained even if one uses bigger scales . in some of those cases the",
    "interpolation again gives negative values for the output of the primordial power spectra and for other values of @xmath52 , which could be bigger or smaller , gives a positive output throughout the whole interpolation process .",
    "the quadrupole and octopole could no be fit at the same time .",
    "for all the models that fit the quadrupole and octopole by trying different initial conditions , there is a range of @xmath53 or equivalently , of pivot scales in which the inflationary observables @xmath54 are inside the @xmath55 intervals respectively , for wmap7 with running and tensors , but not the amplitude of scalar perturbations , which turns out to be very small : @xmath56 in the best of cases , even for those initial conditions with @xmath50 . for the octopole on the contrary ,",
    "the amplitude is too big : @xmath57 .",
    "some comments on the results of the mode integration are made in this subsection .",
    "we have mentioned before that for a fixed initial value of the field , the bigger @xmath23 is or closer to 3 , the less amount of total inflation produced by the model there is .",
    "if one keeps fixed instead the value of the scalar field , in order to have more inflation produced , the value of @xmath23 has to be decreased .",
    "that is , @xmath23 and @xmath47 are correlated and the only free parameter is the total amount of inflation produced @xmath58 . for a fixed amount of total inflation ,",
    "the bigger @xmath23 is , the bigger the initial value of the field must be in order to compensate .",
    "for the mode integration of perturbations , we fixed the initial value of the scale factor to 1 at the beginning of inflation .",
    "as in this scenario there is an epoch of noninflationary expansion , we discarded the number of @xmath1-foldings during that time and reset it to 0 at the beginning of inflation .",
    "in figs .  [ spt_s ] and",
    "[ spt_t ] we present examples for the primordial scalar and tensor power spectra as obtained from a mode - by - mode integration and compared to the corresponding slow - roll predictions .",
    ", @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "the main plot shows the scales in the x - axis in gev , the subplot in mpc@xmath61.,width=326,height=220 ]    , @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "the main plot shows the scales in the x - axis in gev , the subplot in mpc@xmath61.,width=326,height=220 ]    we can observe oscillations in the amplitude of the scalar and tensor perturbations .",
    "we have seen before that the initial value of the first mode to be integrated is already very close to horizon crossing due to the way it is chosen for this scenario .",
    "this means , that we are still able to observe the sub horizon oscillations of the solutions in eq .",
    "( [ etau ] ) before the growing mode dominates . in @xcite",
    ", it is said that those oscillations disappear by considering an initial condition for the scale factor deeper into a previous epoch of radiation domination .",
    "we are not considering this situation here .",
    "however , we have checked that if one chooses a bigger initial scale to do the mode integration , the cutoff and oscillatory behavior observed before disappear completely and the mode integration and slow - roll spectra are the same for all scales .",
    "that is , one obtains pure power - law spectra .",
    "the idea of considering a limited amount of inflationary expansion as a modification of the chaotic inflation scenario implies a choice of initial conditions that have observable consequences . in this scenario ,",
    "the kinetic energy dominates before the onset of inflation and consequently violates the slow - roll conditions at horizon crossing of observable modes before the system joins the inflationary attractor .",
    "the best - fit power spectrum of scalar perturbations shows a sharp cutoff on large scales .",
    "this however , does lead to a significant suppression of the angular cmb power at the largest angular scales .",
    "the reason is that the cutoff in a @xmath62 model with just enough @xmath1-foldings turns out to be at scales that are too large to account for a lack of power in the cmb at the largest angles .",
    "however , one can obtain values very close to those of the reported quadrupole and octopole by considering bigger values of the initial scale to be integrated , and also by tuning the initial conditions to find them separately .",
    "this , however , causes higher multipoles to have much higher values than observed .",
    "however these results are only applicable for the @xmath0 potential .",
    "the results of the mode integration for the tensor modes show that they have less power , as expected , than the scalars and their power spectrum also shows a sharp cutoff at large scales .",
    "an interesting point concerning the initial conditions of the inflaton and @xmath19 is that the monte carlo integration gives predictions of best - fit values only for those intervals specified in the priors .",
    "it does not give information about the physical significance of the region explored , unless that information is contained in the amount of independent samples given by the simulation for different distributions .",
    "we have seen that values @xmath63 give bigger numbers of independent samples .",
    "the monte carlo integration confirms in the sense mentioned above , that a natural initial condition for this scenario corresponds to the first horizon flow function being close to 3 .",
    "we have already seen that an initial epoch of kinetic energy domination naturally leads to this initial condition .",
    "we have been able to prove with the results obtained by the monte carlo integration , that the @xmath0 potential is inside current observational constraints for single - field models of inflation .",
    "the implementation of this scenario still lacks the consideration that the initial conditions for the perturbations can not be in the bunch  davies vacuum and that the equations of motion for the background are approximated by a flat homogeneous universe .",
    "both should be reconsidered in order to have consistency with the fact that there is kinetic energy domination at the beginning of inflation .",
    "however , as a first approach , we could obtain enough information of the main behavior for the inflationary observables and the predictions for the cmb anisotropies given by this scenario .",
    "one should be able now to apply it to different potentials and explore more general situations and their consequences .",
