    "of fundamental importance to the propagation of astrophysical jets is the question of their stability .",
    "jet flows are known to vary over time and certainly in the case of both jets from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , e.g. , the m  87 jet ( harris et al .  1997 ) , and from young stellar objects ( ysos ) , e.g.  the l1551  irs  5 jet ( neckel & staude 1987 ) , this variability can often be traced to the source itself . moreover",
    ", the dynamical interaction between faster jet fluid catching up with slower jet material can explain many of the features that we see for example in yso jets ( raga et al .",
    "1990 ; stone & norman 1993 ) . at the same time",
    ", a number of fluid dynamic instabilities can occur even when the jet flow is , at least initially , very steady .",
    "for example , in purely hydrodynamic flows , rayleigh - taylor and vishniac instabilities may be important especially at the head of yso jets ( blondin et al .",
    "an additional concern is whether or not kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instabilities are important .",
    "certainly kh instabilities are a viable explanation for some morphological features observed in agn jets : for example the well - known sinusoidal appearance of the 3c449 jets has been successfully modeled by the non - linear growth of the helical twisting mode ( hardee et al .",
    "1994 ) .    until recently ,",
    "most treatments of kh instabilities in jets , both of an analytical and numerical nature ( e.g.  birkinshaw 1991 ; bodo et al .",
    "1994 ) have ignored the effects of radiative losses . in the case of agn jets",
    "such an approach is justified since radiative losses can , to a first approximation be ignored .",
    "the same can not be said of their smaller scale counterparts i.e.  jets from ysos ( e.g.  edwards et al .",
    "1993 ; ray 1996 ) where such energy losses have major effects on the development of the flow ( blondin et al .  1990 ; stone & norman 1994 and references therein ) .",
    "bhrke et al .",
    "( 1988 ) were the first to suggest that the knots seen in yso jets might be due to the growth of kh pinching modes .",
    "although it is now generally agreed , especially as a result of hubble space telescope imaging ( e.g.  ray et al .  1997 ; reipurth et al .",
    "1997 ) , that such knots are probably produced by episodic variations in the outflow from the source , it is nevertheless interesting to see what effects , if any , the growth of kh modes might have on the development of yso jets .",
    "effects caused by kh instabilities could be present in addition to those caused by `` pulsing '' .",
    "another interesting question is whether the growth of kh modes might provide a mechanism through which momentum could be transferred to the jet s surroundings and thus accelerate ambient gas .",
    "such momentum transfer would be in addition to any acceleration provided by the so - called `` prompt '' entrainment of ambient material near the head of the jet ( padman et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "recently a number of researchers have investigated the growth of kh modes in radiatively cooled slab jets .",
    "hardee & stone ( 1997 ) , in a linear stability analysis of such jets , solved the kh dispersion relationship numerically for a broad range of perturbation frequencies .",
    "they found that the wavelengths and growth rates of the most unstable kh modes differed considerably from the adiabatic case and that the nature of the cooling function , i.e.  whether it is a steep or shallow function of temperature about its equilibrium value , along with the form of the heating function , is a crucial factor in determining initial growth rates .",
    "their analysis was followed ( stone et al .",
    "1997 ) by a time - dependent hydrodynamical simulation of a cooled jet that traced the growth of the kh instability in the non - linear regime .",
    "stone et al .",
    "( 1997 ) concentrated on the development of asymmetric modes .",
    "such modes , and in particular the helical mode , might be responsible for the `` wiggling '' motion seen in a number of yso jets , e.g.  hh  30 ( lopz et al.1995 ) and may also transport momentum from the jet to its environment ( stone et al .",
    "1997 ) . here",
    "we present the results of time - dependent hydrodynamical simulations of the growth of the kh instability in a radiatively cooled flow using parameters typical of yso jets .",
    "rossi et al .  ( 1997 ) reported the results of simulations of these axisymmetric modes of the kh instability in cylindrical symmetry and found that cooling appears to dampen the growth of the instability .",
    "theory suggests that the linear behaviour of these modes will be similar in both slab and cylindrical symmetry . here",

    "there are two approaches to analysing the kh instability .",
    "one is to perturb a flow at a particular point in space and observe how the disturbance grows as it propagates downstream .",
    "the other is to perturb a flow everywhere and observe how the disturbance grows with time .",

    "the slab jet occupies all of the grid within 1 jet radius of the ` lower ' edge .",
    "the boundary conditions at either end of the grid are set to periodic so that , effectively , we have a jet with infinite length .",
    "the boundary away from the jet axis is set to have gradient zero boundary conditions , while the jet axis boundary conditions are set to reflecting .",
    "the grid cells are uniform in the direction parallel to the jet axis with a size of @xmath54 cm .",
    "perpendicular to this direction the cell spacing obeys @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the cell index perpendicular to the jet axis and @xmath57 cm .",
    "the grid size was set to 400@xmath58200 cells , or about 48@xmath59 jet radii .",
    "we ` stretch ' the cells perpendicular to the jet axis in order to avoid reflections from the upper boundary .",
    "the jet radius was set at 50 cells ( i.e. @xmath60 cm ) which is typical of yso jets ( e.g.  raga 1991 ) .",
    "the jet to ambient density ratio was set to 1 and the jet and ambient medium were set to be in pressure equilibrium also .",
    "three different density regimes were used : 20 @xmath61 , 100 @xmath61 and 300 @xmath61 .",
    "these densities , although perhaps rather low for yso jets ( e.g.  bacciotti et al.1995 ) , were selected to ensure that the cooling lengths behind shocks were resolved .",
    "the pressure was chosen so that the initial temperature on the grid was @xmath52k .",

    "[ coo_heat ] ) .",
    "the calculation was performed in the rest frame of the jet in order to reduce the effect of advection errors on the growth of the instability .",
    "the ambient medium was given an initial velocity of mach 10 ( @xmath62112 km s@xmath26 ) .",
    "the jet material was given a small transverse velocity perturbation : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the number of perturbation wavelengths , @xmath65 is the jet sound speed , @xmath66 is the jet radius , and @xmath67 are approximately 0.21 , 0.42 , 0.52 , 0.84 , 1.05 , 1.68 , and 2.09 .",
    "these values were chosen so that the grid length corresponded to an integral number of wavelengths of each perturbation .",
    "the sine term outside the summation gives the perturbation a profile across the jet radius such that it is zero both on the axis and at the edge of the jet .",
    "therefore , the perturbation has a velocity structure similar to that which would be produced by the first reflecting mode at all these values of @xmath68 .",
    "however , it is not true to say that this perturbation excites only the first reflecting mode since we do not introduce corresponding perturbations in the pressure and density .",
    "it is well known ( e.g. bodo et al .",
    "1994 ) that introducing a shear layer dampens the growth rates of all surface modes and body modes which have wavelengths shorter than the width of the layer . in simulations of adiabatic jets with high mach numbers",
    "this is generally unimportant as the growth rates of the surface waves are usually much less than the growth rates of the body modes .",
    "however , in radiatively cooled jets analytic studies suggest that a surface mode exists which has growth rates higher than all other modes for a large range of wavelengths if the cooling function around @xmath51 is shallow enough ( see hardee & stone 1997 ) .",
    "therefore it is important that we run simulations with different thicknesses for the shear layer in order to study the effect of this surface mode if it is present .",
    "the jet itself is given a ` top - hat ' velocity profile modified by a term so that a shear layer exists initially between the jet and ambient medium .",
    "two forms of this term have been tested .",
    "the first is identical to that of rossi et al .",

    "this latter shear layer is wide enough to be well resolved by the code , and hence avoids numerical errors which lead to spurious waves being emitted from the jet boundary .",
    "the latter was chosen for the majority of simulations in the parameter space study .",
    "the analysis of the results of these simulations to find the growth rates of the kh modes is not trivial .",
    "first the velocity perpendicular to the jet axis was averaged over 1 jet radius at a particular time .",
    "a fourier transform of the resulting data was performed and the power contained in the wavelengths of the initial perturbation were recorded .",
    "this was done at several times during the simulation and these powers were used to derive growth rates .",
    "the averaging process described above was carried out to reduce the effect of the different distributions of amplitude of the kh modes across the jet radius .",
    "the signal at a particular wavelength from a single row of cells parallel to the jet axis will change with distance from the axis .",
    "this signal will be given by a complicated weighted mean of the modes present .",
    "the weighting associated with a particular mode is determined by the distribution of the disturbance due to that mode across the jet .",
    "thus , for example , if we take a row of cells located very close to the edge of the jet , the signal we receive might come primarily from surface modes .",
    "if we locate the row of cells a distance of @xmath71 from the jet axis the signal we will receive will be biased towards the first body mode , although it may be modified significantly by the presence of other odd index body modes .",
    "averaging reduces the effects of these problems .",
    "it is important to note that the averaging process described above has the effect of removing the signal from even - index body modes and it also reduces the signal from surface modes .",
    "the growth rates calculated on the basis of this averaging will be a weighted mean of the odd - index modes present at the wavelength in question , with the lower index modes being more heavily weighted .",
    "several tests were performed using this averaging technique for the growth of the kh instability in an adiabatic jet with a mach number of 10 and density ratio of 1 .",
    "the derived growth rates were within 20% of those predicted by linear analysis where only one mode was present .",
    "if more than one mode was present , the derived growth rates at a particular wavelength lay between the growth rates predicted from theory for the modes present at that wavelength , as expected .",
    "we have run 9 simulations with identical initial conditions , but with different techniques for calculating the energy loss function @xmath7 .",
    "none of the simulations shown here have linear growth rates which are significantly different to the adiabatic growth rates .",
    "this is in agreement with the linear results of rossi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and would be expected anyway since the cooling times near equilibrium are much longer than any other time scales in the system .",
    "in addition we have run simulations , both cooled and adiabatic , to test the effect of varying the shear layers as described above .",
    "it was found , in general , that widening the shear layer , while changing the behaviour of the system for a short time at the beginning of the non - linear phase , did not significantly alter the long - term evolution of the jet .",
    "we will begin by describing the evolution of a typical radiatively cooled simulation and comparing this with the evolution of an adiabatic simulation with identical initial conditions .",
    "we will then discuss the results of the parameter space study in terms of    * the transfer of momentum from jet material to ambient material * the distribution of momentum throughout the grid * the strength of shocks produced on the jet axis    each of these sections will be broken down into an analysis of the effect of the shear layer and an analysis of the effect of the different heating terms .",
    "all times are quoted in units of the sound crossing time @xmath72 . in the simulations presented here @xmath73 yrs .",
    "as already noted , the linear behaviour of the kh instability was not significantly altered by the introduction of cooling for the parameters chosen here .",
    "this would be expected since the cooling time around equilibrium is longer than any other time - scales in these simulations .",
    "once we enter the non - linear regime , however , cooling has a dramatic effect on the evolution of the system .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ tracer ] which contains grey - scale plots of the distribution of the jet tracer variable at various times throughout an adiabatic and a cooled simulation .",
    "we can see that very little mixing occurs in the adiabatic simulation and the jet expands due to the conversion of bulk kinetic energy to internal energy by the growth of waves due to the kh instability .",
    "differences between the adiabatic and cooled jets become noticeable at @xmath74 and by @xmath75 there are very significant differences in the distribution of jet material . the cooled jet material remains closer to the axis and , in addition , ambient material has been funneled onto the axis by the distortion on the surface of the jet . from this figure",
    "we would intuitively expect stronger shocks to form in the cooled jet as a result of this funneling of ambient material towards the axis .",
    "in fact this is not the case , due to the oblique nature of the shocks formed and also the damping of the body modes by cooling observed by rossi et al .",

    "the simulation which simply assumes the cooling to be insignificant below @xmath51 forms the strongest shocks .    in general , the shocks produced by the instability in radiative jets are quite flat , but with a slight bow shape pointing _ towards _ the jet source . in the adiabatic simulations these shocks tend to be more curved with the apex of the curve pointing away from the jet source .",
    "the proper motions of the shocks produced in the simulations have been measured as the motion of the shock with respect to the ambient medium .",
    "the adiabatic simulations produced shocks with proper motions in the range 0.7@xmath1000.9@xmath100 while the shocks in the cooled simulations moved with proper motions of 0.3@xmath1000.9@xmath100 .",
    "no significant differences were found between the proper motions of shocks produced by different heating terms or densities .",
    "strong shocks were found to move slower with respect to the jet source than weaker shocks , as would be expected from momentum balance arguments .",
    "while making these measurements it was noted that , in cooled jets , the shock pattern tends to coalesce into 1 shock within a few crossing times of the first shocks appearing .",
    "the rate of coalescence was found to increase with the density of the jet .",
    "shocks were not found to coalesce in the adiabatic simulations .",
    "we have performed a total of 12 different simulations of the kh instability in jets .",
    "the parameters were chosen to approximate the physical conditions thought to prevail in jets from young stellar objects .",
    "we have found that introducing cooling    * increases the level of mixing between jet and ambient material * increases the amount of momentum transferred from jet material to ambient material * increases the time taken for shocks to develop in the flow * reduces the strength of these shocks * reduces the rate of decollimation of the momentum flux    the first and second of these results are somewhat surprising as they contradict the results presented by rossi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . however , we found it possible to reproduce the results of rossi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) by performing the simulations in cylindrical symmetry .",
    "therefore we can conclude that , although in the linear regime we do not expect significant differences between the 2 symmetries , _ the non - linear growth of the instability is significantly affected by the choice of symmetry_.    we will now explain how radiative jets can transfer more momentum to the ambient medium while the momentum flux in these systems remains better collimated than in an adiabatic system .",
    "as the kh instability grows , longitudinal momentum will be converted to internal energy by the resulting compressions and shocks within the jet .",
    "if the jet is not cooled it will , as a result , become overpressured and begin to expand and so momentum will be moved away from the jet axis .",
    "this mechanism allows longitudinal momentum to be transported away from the jet axis while still remaining in jet material .",
    "if , on the other hand , the jet is cooled this internal energy is radiated away causing the jet to remain in approximate pressure equilibrium with the surrounding medium and thus momentum will not be transported away from the jet axis in this way .",
    "in fact , as the instability grows in the cooled jet the surface of the jet develops a saw - tooth profile which steepens and eventually funnels ambient material towards the jet axis , causing mixing .",
    "it is in this way that momentum is transferred from jet to ambient material in the radiatively cooled simulations .",
    "it is interesting that the shocks produced by this process do not appear to decollimate the jet .",
    "the process by which the steepening of the disturbance on the surface of the jet occurs can be understood as follows .",
    "as the jet s surface becomes perturbed by the transverse velocity perturbation , the expanding parts of the jet begin to compress the surrounding ambient medium .",
    "this process heats both ambient and jet material near the boundary between the two .",
    "the region is then cooled and a dense filament will form at the boundary .",
    "the inertia of this filament will cause the smooth wave pattern to be converted to a saw - tooth one as the wave grows in amplitude .",
    "this process is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ steepening ] . put another way , the waves steepen and ` break ' earlier in the radiative than the adiabatic case because of a stronger dependence of the wave speed on its amplitude .",
    "= 8.8 cm    the shocks produced in the adiabatic jet are formed by the growth of body modes .",
    "our results suggest that cooling of the type expected in yso jets inhibits the development of shocks and this is in agreement with the results of rossi et al .",
    "this is because the development of the instability takes longer due to the increased levels of cooling in low density regions and vice versa for high density regions with respect to equilibrium values ( see hardee & stone 1997 ) .",
    "therefore , in a cooled jet , the time taken for shocks to develop in the jet is increased .",
    "note however , that while this explanation is valid for these simulations , it does not imply that , in general , shocks resulting from the kh instability are weaker if cooling is introduced .",
    "we emphasize that whether this is the case in general depends on the form of the heating and cooling functions .",
    "our simulations suggest that widening the shear layer does not significantly affect the long term evolution of the system .    this result is easily explained .",
    "previous studies of the kh instability in adiabatic jets ( e.g. payne & cohn 1985 ; hardee & norman 1988 ) have shown that the surface modes do not grow as fast as the body modes in high mach number flows for @xmath101 .",
    "a wide shear layer tends to damp the growth of surface modes and body modes with wavelengths less than the width of the layer ( for example , bodo et al .",
    "1994 ) . therefore , although widening the shear layer will damp surface modes , we know that in an adiabatic jet these modes do not have a significant effect on the jet anyway . since it is these modes which are expected to disrupt the jet and thus cause mixing and transfer of momentum from jet material to ambient material , we do not expect widening the shear layer to have much effect on momentum transfer in the adiabatic case . according to hardee & stone ( 1997 ) introduction of cooling can allow a new surface mode to grow which has higher growth rates than any other modes present if the cooling function is shallow enough around @xmath51 . in our simulations it is difficult to tell whether the cooling function is shallow enough around @xmath51 as it is a non - equilibrium one and we also include energy dumped into ionisation in our calculations . since the differences in growth rates introduced by the narrowing of the shear layer are of order a few percent , it seems reasonable to say that this surface mode does not exist , or at least has a very low growth rate , for the energy loss functions studied here .",
    "detectable differences were found between simulations which included a constant volume heating term and those which included a heating term proportional to @xmath1 . generally , the inclusion of the former resulted in behaviour more similar to an adiabatic system than simulations with the latter kind of heating term , though this difference is relatively small .",
    "simulations with the assumption that the cooling is insignificant below @xmath51 were dramatically different from adiabatic simulations and were generally more unstable than the simulations which used a heating function to maintain initial equilibrium .",
    "this difference is unlikely to arise from the growth of the surface mode mentioned by hardee & stone ( 1997 ) because of the very low level of the cooling around @xmath51 for the modified cooling function described in eq .",
    "[ cooling : tanh ] .",
    "it is more likely to be due to the fact that there is no heating term in the system and this allows the instability to grow faster than in the other cooled systems .",
    "the injection of energy by a heating term makes the system as a whole more similar to an adiabatic one .",
    "it is plausible to suggest that the lack of a heating term will therefore accentuate any differences between adiabatic and cooled systems .",
    "as already stated , the results of simulations of the cooled kh instability in slab and cylindrical symmetry differ in 2 respects . in slab symmetry",
    "the introduction of cooling    * increases the level of mixing between jet and ambient material * increases the amount of momentum transferred from jet material to ambient material    whereas the introduction of cooling in cylindrical symmetry does the opposite .",
    "we can understand this as follows .",
    "the increase in mixing and momentum transfer in slab symmetry results from disturbances on the surface of the jet steepening due to cooling as discussed in sect .",
    "[ general_differences ] . while we do not expect this steepening process to be significantly modified by the choice of symmetry we note that axisymmetric waves of a given amplitude on the surface of the jet require higher pressures ( and hence higher temperatures ) on the jet axis in cylindrical symmetry .",
    "this is because the amplitude of an axisymmetric wave in cylindrical symmetry goes as @xmath102 whereas it is independent of @xmath103 in slab symmetry .",
    "thus if the system is cooled , and the cooling function is an increasing function of @xmath104 , we expect cooling to damp the waves more in cylindrical than in slab symmetry .",
    "hence the disturbances on the surface of the jet will be lower in amplitude and take longer to steepen .",
    "this is precisely what we observe in cylindrically symmetric simulations . by the time",
    "the waves have steepened significantly the corresponding adiabatic jet will have disrupted .",
    "hence we conclude that , while slab symmetric simulations are adequate to approximate the linear behaviour of the axisymmetric modes of the kh instability in cooled cylindrical jets , such simulations give misleading results in the the non - linear regime . in principle",
    "one would expect the above argument to hold for studies which examine the growth of the helical modes of the kh instability using slab symmetric simulations of the sinusoidal modes ( e.g.  stone et al .",
    "however , this assumes that the most significant waves are ones which pass through the body of the jet rather than along its surface .",
