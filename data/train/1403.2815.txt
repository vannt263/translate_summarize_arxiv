    "one of the long - standing problems in the standard big bang cosmology is the initial singularity from which all matter and energy originated .",
    "standard cosmology based on general relativity offers no resolution to this problem .",
    "however , a quantum gravitational model of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) offers a nice solution .",
    "the theory and principles of lqg , when applied in the cosmological framework , creates a new theoretical framework of loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) @xcite .",
    "the main idea is that lqc assumes a discrete nature of space which leads , at quantum level , to consider a hilbert space where quantum states are represented by almost periodic functions of the dynamical part of the connection @xcite .",
    "due to quantum corrections , the friedmann equations get modified .",
    "the big bang singularity is resolved and replaced by a quantum bounce @xcite . for a brief summary on loop quantum cosmology ,",
    "see reference @xcite .",
    "nowadays , the accelerated expansion of the present universe has been supported by various independent cosmological observations . as representative procedures to explain the late time acceleration ,",
    "the first is to assume the existence of an unknown component called dark energy , which has as one of the main feature a negative pressure ( which can be considered as responsible for the accelerated expansions the universe is undergoing ) .",
    "the second is to modify gravity , the simplest model of which is @xmath4 gravity .    in general , dark energy can be assumed to be a perfect fluid with equation of state given by @xmath5 , which realizes the current cosmic acceleration .",
    "moreover , the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) observations indicate that the central value of the equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath6 is given by @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this means that our universe would be dominated by phantom energy ( @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath9 ) .",
    "the standard viewpoint of lqc assumes , at quantum level , a discrete nature of space which leads to a quadratic modification @xmath10 in its effective friedmann equation at high energies @xcite .",
    "this modified friedmann equation depicts the ellipse in the plane @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the hubble parameter and @xmath13 the energy density of the universe ( for more details , see reference @xcite ) .",
    "we must also underline here that the lqc model prevents singularities like the big bang or the big rip . using lqc",
    "when one considers a model of universe filled by radiation and matter where , due to the cosmological constant , there are a de sitter and an anti de sitter solution @xcite .",
    "the effects of loop quantum gravity can be described in two possible ways : the first one is based on the modification of the behavior of the inverse scale factor operator .",
    "this approach has been used to study quantum bounces , avoidance of singularities and to produce inflationary expansion @xcite .",
    "a second approach is to add a term quadratic in density to the friedmann equation . in lqc ,",
    "the non - perturbative effects lead to correction term @xmath14 to the standard friedmann equation . with the inclusion of this term",
    ", the universe bounces quantum mechanically as the energy density of matter - energy reaches the level of @xmath15 ( i.e. of order of the planck density ) .",
    "thus the lqc is non - singular by producing a bounce before the occurrence of any potential singularity and hence transitions from a pre - bang and after - bang are all well - defined .",
    "the observational constraints due to the quadratic term are discussed in scientific literature [ 9 ] where it is shown that the model with quadratic correction to density is consistent with the observational tests .",
    "the development of lqc as a @xmath16 theory allows the study of lqc perturbations using the perturbation equations in @xmath16 modified gravity .",
    "this is an alternative to the study of perturbations in lqc up to the present , which is based on phenomenological corrections .    in reference @xcite , lqc",
    "have been considered and the modified friedmann and raychauduri equations has been derived . moreover , future singularities in lqc have been studied and it was shown that the rip singularities do not survive , but type ii and type iv singularities could still happen .    for other models in ordinary @xmath16 gravity ,",
    "namely , not in the framework of lqc , the type i and type iv singularities can eventually appear in the finite time limit for a power - law form of @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , the lr and pl scenarios can be realized for specific power - law type models of @xmath16 gravity @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the features of future singularities occurring in @xmath16 gravity in the context of lqc would be different from those of other models in @xmath16 gravity .    in this paper , we consider modified teleparallel gravity theory with the torsion scalar have recently gained a lot of attention as a possible explanation of dark energy .",
    "we perform a thorough reconstruction analysis on the @xmath16 models , where @xmath16 is some general function of the torsion term , and derive conditions for the equivalence between of @xmath16 models with purely kinetic k - essence .",
    "we present a new class models of @xmath16-gravity and k - essence .",
    "we also proposed some new models of generalized gases and knot universes as well as some generalizations of @xmath16 gravity .    in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the evolution of our universe dominated by a scalar field in lqc , which has constant equation of state and interacts with dark matter , and then investigate whether there are some interesting features arising from the loop quantum gravity effect .",
    "we will concentrate to the fridmann - robertson - walker metric case of the form : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the scale factor .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way . in section 2",
    ", we give a brief description of the classical friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) model . in section 3",
    ", we present a brief review of the standard frw model of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) . in section 4 ,",
    "we study two particular cases of the @xmath0-model . in section 5 ,",

    "<S> in this paper , we study the main cosmological properties of the classical friedmann equations in the case of homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - robertson - walker universe and we also generalized the expression of the friedmann equation in the case of loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) . considering the @xmath0-model , we found the solutions of the equations considered for two particular cases , i.e. @xmath1 ( i.e. , the de sitter solution ) and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we considered and studied two exact cosmological solutions of the @xmath0-model , in particular the power - law and the exponential ones . </S>",
    "<S> futhermore , we also considered a third more complicated case and we derived the solution for an arbitrary function of the time @xmath3 . a scalar field description of the model is presented by constructing its self - interacting potential . </S>"
