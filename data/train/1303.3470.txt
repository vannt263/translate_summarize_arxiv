    "we remark also that the condition of non - flatness on the critical points can not be removed : in @xcite hall was able to construct @xmath73 homeomorphisms of the circle with no periodic points and no dense orbits .",
    "recall that an irrational number is of _ bounded type _ if it satisfies the diophantine condition ( [ diof ] ) for @xmath74 , that is , @xmath55 in @xmath75 $ ] is of bounded type if there exists @xmath13 such that:@xmath76for any integers @xmath14 and @xmath77 . on one hand",
    "this is a respectable class : the set of numbers of bounded type is dense in @xmath75 $ ] , with hausdorff dimension equal to one . on the other hand , from the metrical viewpoint , this is a rather restricted class : while diophantine numbers have full lebesgue measure in @xmath75 $ ] , the set of numbers of bounded type has zero lebesgue measure .    since a critical circle map can not be smoothly conjugate to a rigid rotation , in order to study smooth - rigidity problems we must restrict to the class of critical circle maps .",
    "numerical observations ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) suggested in the early eighties that smooth critical circle maps with rotation number of bounded type are geometrically rigid .",
    "this was posed as a conjecture in several works by lanford ( @xcite , @xcite ) , rand ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , see also @xcite ) and shenker ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) among others :    any two @xmath0 critical circle maps with the same irrational rotation number of bounded type and the same odd criticality are conjugate to each other by a @xmath1 circle diffeomorphism , for some @xmath2 .    the conjecture has been proved by de faria and de melo for real - analytic critical circle maps @xcite and nowadays ( after the work of yampolsky , khanin and teplinsky ) it is understood without any assumption on the irrational rotation number : inside each topological class of real - analytic critical circle maps the degree of the critical point is the unique invariant of the @xmath8-conjugacy classes . in the following result",
    "we summarize many contributions of the authors quoted above :    [ riganalitico ] let @xmath22 and @xmath78 be two real - analytic circle homeomorphisms with the same irrational rotation number and with a unique critical point of the same odd type . let @xmath79 be the conjugacy between @xmath22 and @xmath78 ( given by yoccoz s result ) that maps the critical point of @xmath22 to the critical point of @xmath78 ( note that this determines @xmath79 ) .",

    "[ aitem1 ] @xmath79 is a @xmath8 diffeomorphism .",
    "[ aitem2 ] @xmath79 is @xmath1 at the critical point of @xmath22 for a universal @xmath2 .",
    "[ aitem3 ] for a full lebesgue measure set of rotation numbers ( that contains all bounded type numbers ) @xmath79 is globally @xmath1 .",
    "on one hand , the presence of the critical point gives us more rigidity than in the case of diffeomorphisms : smooth conjugacy is obtained for all irrational rotation numbers , with no diophantine conditions . on the other hand , there exist examples ( @xcite , @xcite ) showing that @xmath79 may not be globally @xmath1 in general , even for real - analytic dynamics .    item of theorem [ riganalitico ] was proved by khanin and teplinsky in @xcite , building on earlier work of de faria , de melo and yampolsky ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . item was proved in @xcite and item is obtained combining @xcite with @xcite .",
    "the proof of theorem [ riganalitico ] relies on methods coming from complex analysis and complex dynamics ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and that is why rigidity is well understood for real - analytic critical circle maps , but nothing was known yet for smooth ones ( even in the @xmath20 setting ) . in this article",
    "we take the final step and solve positively the rigidity conjecture :    [ main ] any two @xmath0 critical circle maps with the same irrational rotation number of bounded type and the same odd criticality are conjugate to each other by a @xmath1 circle diffeomorphism , for some universal @xmath2 .    the novelties of this article in order to transfer rigidity from real - analytic dynamics to ( finitely ) smooth ones",

    "let us discuss the main ideas of the proof of theorem [ main ] : a @xmath0 critical circle map @xmath22 with irrational rotation number generates a sequence @xmath80 of commuting pairs of interval maps , each one being the renormalization of the previous one ( see definition [ renop ] ) . to prove theorem [ main ] we need to prove the exponential convergence of the orbits generated by two critical circle maps with a given combinatorics of bounded type ( see theorem [ primeroedsonwelington ] ) .",
    "our main task ( see theorem [ compacto ] in section [ secred ] ) is to show the existence of a sequence @xmath81 that belongs to a universal @xmath82-compact set of real - analytic critical commuting pairs , such that @xmath83 is @xmath7-exponentially close to @xmath84 at a universal rate , and both have the same rotation number . in section [ secred ] , using the exponential contraction of the renormalization operator on the space of real - analytic critical commuting pairs ( see theorem [ uniform ] ) , we conclude the exponential contraction of the renormalization operator in the space of @xmath0 critical commuting pairs with bounded combinatorics ( see theorem [ expconv ] in section [ secfirstred ] ) , and therefore the @xmath1 rigidity as stated in theorem [ main ] .    to realize the main task we extend the initial commuting pair to a pair of @xmath0 maps in an open complex neighbourhood of each original interval ( the so - called _ extended lift _",
