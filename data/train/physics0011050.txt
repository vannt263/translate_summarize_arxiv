    ", a joint action of the magnetic field and hyperfine interaction creates different population of magnetic sublevels @xmath14 and @xmath15 of hyperfine levels @xmath13 .",
    "this means that _ longitudinal _ orientation of atoms along the direction of an external magnetic field is created .",
    "recently it was predicted that joint action of a magnetic field and hyperfine interaction from an initially aligned ensemble would create _ transverse _ orientation of angular momentum  of atoms or molecules @xcite .",
    "transverse orientation implies orientation in a direction perpendicular to the external magnetic field @xmath3 . in this particular case",
    "magnetic sublevels @xmath14 and @xmath16 are equally populated , but orientation is a result of coherence between pairs of wave functions of magnetic sublevels @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",
    "creation of transverse orientation is achieved if the excitation light polarization vector is neither parallel nor perpendicular to the external magnetic field direction with the largest effect occurring for the case of a light polarization ",

    ", the magnitude of created orientation was found to decrease rapidly .",

    "as we will show , this effect is interesting not only as a new way to create orientated atoms , but also can be used to increase the accuracy with which constants related to the hyperfine interaction can be determined .",
    "the general scheme how transverse orientation of angular momentum is created from an aligned ensemble of atoms is the following :  initial alignment , for example by absorption of a linearly polarized light , is created at some non - zero acute angle with respect to the direction of an external - field ( in this case a @xmath3-field . )  the optimum angle is @xmath0 , but the effect will take place at any angle that differs form @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the perturbing field together with the hyperfine interaction causes unequally spaced magnetic sublevel splittings .  under these conditions , angular momenta orientation at the direction perpendicular to the direction of the external field",
    "is created @xcite .",
    "a semiclassical interpretation of this effect in terms of angular momentum precession in an external field can be found in a previous publication @xcite .  in this vectorial model , alignment ",
    "orientation conversion is the result of a different precession rate for different orientations of angular momentum with respect to the external field .  in what follows",
    "we explain this transverse - orientation in terms of a accurate quantum mechanical model .    in the present study we exploit laser excitation of pure isotopes of rb atoms from their ground state @xmath1 to the first excited state @xmath23 ( resonance d@xmath12 line ) ( see inset figure [ rb_85_lin ] . )",

    "the ground - state - level splittings for @xmath10rb and @xmath25rb are approximately @xmath31 ghz and @xmath32 ghz respectively .",
    "in contrast , the four excited state hyperfine components are separated by only several hundred mhz ( see figures [ rb_85_levels ] and [ rb_87_levels ] ) .",
    "excited - state - hyperfine structure in absorption is not resolved due to doppler broadening and laser - frequency jittering . to make an accurate signal modeling assuming broad line excitation , laser frequency is modulated by a few hundred mhz superimposing a @xmath33 khz sine wave on laser current .",
    "this allows accurate modeling to be done assuming that the excitation radiation is broad enough to excite all hyperfine components of the excited state without frequency selection , yet narrow enough to completely resolve the two ground - state components .",

    "the fact the @xmath17 remains a good quantum number whereas @xmath38does not is important to the interpretation of the data .    a convenient way to describe excited state atoms",

    "these expansion coefficients along with the magnetic sublevel energy splittings @xmath55 can be obtained by a standard procedure of diagonalization of a hamilton matrix that contains both the diagonal hyperfine elements and the off - diagonal magnetic field interaction elements ( see for example @xcite . )    there are several methods how to tell whether or not a particular atomic state described by a density matrix ( [ eq1 ] ) possesses orientation .",
    "one possibility is to expand this matrix over the irreducible tensorial operators .",
    "then those expansion coefficients can directly be attributed to the alignment and orientation of the atomic ensemble @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one may calculate directly the fluorescence circularity rate in spontaneous transitions from a particular excited state of an atom : @xmath56 observed circularity of the fluorescence in a specific direction can differ from zero only for the case that the ensemble of atoms possesses overall orientation in this direction @xcite .",
    "@xmath57 and @xmath58 are intensities of two fluorescence components with opposite circularity .",

    "this leads to resonance behavior of  the observed signal .  for case of excitation with linearly polarized light",
    ", the intensity of the resonance depends upon the angle between polarization direction of the laser light and external magnetic field direction . if the angle between these directions is @xmath21 , different magnetic sublevels are differently populated but no coherence is created in the ensemble . if the angle is @xmath22 coherence is created between magnetic sublevels with @xmath71 .",
    "if the angle differs form @xmath21 and @xmath22 then magnetic sublevels with @xmath69 and @xmath30 @xcite are excited coherently .",
    "this @xmath69 coherence is required for transverse orientation .",
    "we now consider the fluorescence circularity enhancement due to @xmath72 level crossing for the case  that the linear polarization and external field meet at an angle of @xmath0 ( inset figure [ rb_85_circ ] . )",

    "the resonance peak is more pronounced for the @xmath76 absorption transition than for the @xmath77 transition .    because a @xmath33 g field is weak enough not to cause substantial hyperfine level mixing ( i.e. , the magnetic sublevel splitting in the magnetic field still is small in comparison with hyperfine splitting , ) the increase in orientation for @xmath27 absorption",
    "can be understood using the relative transition probability @xmath78 given by sobelman @xcite : @xmath79 here @xmath80 and @xmath81 are quantum numbers of total and orbital electronic angular momentum of the initial and final atomic state and @xmath82 is the electronic spin of the atomic state .",

    "fluorescence linear polarization as a function of magnetic field is measured .  here",
    "we repeat this experiment for the case of @xmath10rb ( see inset of figure [ rb_85_lin ] . )",
    "two signals are numerically simulated and experimentally recorded , the first one when absorption occurs on the transitions ( @xmath120 ) and a second one for a ( @xmath121 ) absorption transition . in both cases the conditions are maintained so that the excited state hyperfine levels are not resolved .",
    "for the first absorption transition in the absence of the magnetic field electric dipole transitions are allowed only to the levels @xmath122 and @xmath31 . for the second absorption transition in absence of the external field hyperfine components with @xmath123 and @xmath124",

    "change substantially . as it was mentioned before , @xmath34 is no longer a good quantum number .",
    "each hyperfine level in the presence of external field is mixed together with others .",
    "as far as @xmath125 remains a good quantum number in the presence of the external field , only components with the same @xmath125 are mixed .",
    "this implies that for the present example of @xmath10rb , magnetic sublevels with @xmath126 and @xmath127 at any field value are unmixed because only @xmath128 contains such sublevels and there is no counterpart for these states to be mixed with . in case of @xmath129 and @xmath130",
    "only two magnetic sublevels originating from @xmath131 and @xmath124 are mixed together , etc .",
    "this means that magnetic sublevels @xmath132 in external field are composed from @xmath133 components , @xmath134 , from @xmath135 components @xmath136 , from @xmath137 components but @xmath138 , contain only one component @xmath139 .    in figure [ rb_85_levels ]",
    "we can see several @xmath68 magnetic sublevel crossings .",
    "the first crossing takes place at zero magnetic field when all magnetic sublevels belonging to the same hyperfine level have the same energy .",
    "this crossing is the zero field level crossing .  because all magnetic sublevels belonging to the same hyperfine state cross at zero field , the zero field level crossing leads to the largest resonance amplitude .",
    "then subsequent crossings take place at approximately @xmath140 and @xmath141 g magnetic field strength .",
    "a resonant peak occurs on both linear polarization signals for almost every one of these level crossings , although with differing amplitudes ( see figure [ rb_85_lin ] . )",
    "there is one exception .",
    "the strong resonance peak at @xmath142 g that is present in @xmath143 signal is missing in @xmath144 signal .",
    "this seeming inconsistency can be easily explained .",
    "this resonance appears when the magnetic sublevels @xmath145 and @xmath146 are crossing .",
    "but as it was mentioned due to dipole transition selection rules the @xmath147 level can not be excited from @xmath27 and this restriction can not be removed by external field because @xmath147 remains unmixed at any field strength .    in the same figure [ rb_85_lin ] along with the theoretically simulated signal",
    "the experimentally registered signal is depicted as well .",
    "the only adjustable parameter in this comparison is a scaling factor for the overall intensity of the experimentally detected signal .",
    "the observed signals agrees very well with level crossing signal registered by several groups before us @xcite .",
    "however , in these previous studies the first derivative from the intensity was measured and so we were able to compare only the exact positions of resonances .",
    "these coincide perfectly . in our case",
    "we are able to calculate not only the positions of resonances , but also the shape , width and relative amplitudes of the resonance peaks .",
    "in this study we report for the first time the appearance of transverse orientation in atoms with hyperfine structure after excitation by linearly polarized light in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "we have also presented a theory that is in  quantitative agreement with our data .",
    "the use of transverse alignment - orientation as a probe of level crossings is compared to previous measurements  the case of measured circularity has an advantage over the more conventional measurement of the degree of linear polarization :  for the case of alignment  orientation conversion , there is no signal in the absence of the external field .",
    "this implies that we do not have the first trivial resonance position at zero field value which is always present in traditional geometry ( hanle effect @xcite . )",
    "this allows measurements of first level crossing positions that are very close to the zero field resonance . in traditional methods",
    "these resonances are hidden under the zero field peak .",
    "for example , from the inset of figure [ rb_85_levels ] we can see that there must exist several resonances of @xmath71 crossings around @xmath31 and @xmath32 g. however these resonances are hidden in a traditional level crossing signal and can not be observed ( see figure [ rb_85_lin ] . ) at the same time @xmath69 crossings that appear even at smaller field values @xmath148 and @xmath149 g in alignment  orientation conversion signals , although not fully resolved are clearly visible .",
