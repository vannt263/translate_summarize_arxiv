    "an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) is comprised of three major elements , an accretion disc , a central spinning black hole ( bh ) , and a jet",
    ". the complex interactions among them result in fascinating phenomena of all bands , from radio , optical to x - ray and gamma - ray , and displaying in all forms , from images to spectra and time varying effects .",
    "although tremendous progresses have been made in understanding the mechanisms underlying them , many fundamental questions are still open .",
    "firstly , frame dragging produced by a rotating bh with angular momentum @xmath0 causes precession of a particle if its orbital plane is inclined in relation to the equatorial plane of the rotation object .",
    "this is known as the lense - thirring effect @xcite , with a precession velocity , @xmath1 , of strong function of radius , @xmath2 , so that the inner parts of the disc tends to align with the direction of the bh spin .    in the case where the bh spin is misaligned with the rotation direction of the disc ,",
    "the disc becomes twisted and warped .",
    "such a warp can propagate in the disc in a diffusive manner through viscosity @xcite . and",
    "the warp can make a large increase in the accretion rate @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "when a bh is in a binary system , the inner regions of the disc remain aligned with the spin of the central bh . whereas , the outer region precesses around the orbital axis , owing to the tidal torque of the companion object @xcite .",
    "this results in a warped and twisted disc .",
    "the apparent lack of correlation between the orientation of the radio jets and the plane of the host galaxies disc might also be attributed to warped discs @xcite .",
    "then there is a question : what if a disc is so warped that the jet axis aligning with the inner disc touches the outer disc ?",
    "once such a warp induced jet - disc interaction occurs , the inner and outer parts of a warped disc interact in a new way other than the viscosity , which influences the precession velocity of jet , accretion rate and stability of the disc .",
    "secondly , accretion disc has been proven to be one effective mechanism of extracting gravitational potential energy and converting it to radiation powering agns .",
    "no matter a disc is warped or not , the accreted material at the inner region of the disc has to dissipate its angular momentum in order to fall on to the bh .",
    "if there is no external torque , the angular momentum loss is achieved through the accretion disc by outwardly transferring angular momentum .",
    "accretion onto an agn black hole will be limited largely by how rapidly angular momentum can be lost , which determines the power of agn directly .",
    "the angular momentum transferred to the periphery must have a reasonable way of loss , or the accumulation of external angular momentum would cause instability in the accretion disc .",
    "thirdly , one of the fundamental and defining characteristics of agns is the presence of broad emission lines in their optical and ultraviolet ( uv ) spectra .",
    "the investigation of the profile and intensities of these lines show that they originate in dense gas moving very fast around the central engine , which are thought to be fully exposed to the intense radiation from the engine .",
    "the outer region of disc and wind from disc as possible origins of blr have been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "however , the complexity of observations , e.g. , the double - peaked broad emission lines are thought to originate in disc , while the local viscosity heating is usually insufficient for the observed luminosity of the emission site ; and the correlation of blr ( optical and uv ) with fe k@xmath3 ( x - ray ) lines indicate that the origin of blr is still an open question .",
    "interestingly , each of the three questions , the precession property , transfer of angular momentum , and origin of blr , appears to be unrelated and difficult , but all of them together point to a simple scenario : sprinkler , with the water stream replaced by the jet and  impact arm \" replaced by the outer parts of accretion disc .",
    "the collision between jet ( formed by relativistic electrons ) and the outer disc ( slow baryons ) , automatically kicked out baryons from the disc , which provides a channel of angular momentum dissipation of a disc .",
    "moreover , such a jet disc interaction influences the overall precession velocity of the disc .",
    "finally , the baryons in the disc , carrying velocity gained through the collision with electrons , spread around the collision site , which naturally account for the major features of blr .",
    "therefore , sprinklers in our yards , may provide a clue to understand what happens to  sprinklers \" of the garden of universe .",
    "once a disc is warped as shown in fig.@xmath4 , the jet - disc interaction occurs .",
    "the collision sites separate from the central engine by a distance @xmath5 .",
    "the opening angle of the jet cone is denoted , @xmath6 , and the misalignment angle between the jet axis and the axis of the precession cone is @xmath7 , as shown in fig.@xmath4 .",
    "at different radii of a disc , gaseous material is orbiting with differing angular velocities , @xmath8 , determined by kepler s third law . because of the ever present chaotic thermal motions of fluid molecules or turbulent motions of fluid elements , viscous stresses are generated .",
    "this type of transport process is known as shear viscosity .",
    "the torque exerted by the outer ring on the inner one (= @xmath9the torque of the inner on the outer ) is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the kinematic viscosity , @xmath12 is the surface density of the disc , and @xmath13 is the angular velocity .",
    "such a torque corresponds to a transfer of angular momentum ( per unit time ) to the outermost ring , @xmath14 the accretion rate of mass @xmath15 can be expressed by , @xmath16,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the schwarzschild radius of a bh .",
    "substitute the kepler angular velocity , @xmath18 , and eq.@xmath19 into eq.@xmath20 , the angular momentum loss rate can be written in terms of @xmath21 , @xmath22\\mathop { \\cdot \\frac { { - 3}}{2}(\\frac{{g\\mathop m\\nolimits_p } } { { \\mathop r\\nolimits^5 } } \\mathop ) \\nolimits^{1/2 } \\ } |}\\nolimits_{r = \\mathop r\\nolimits_0 } \\\\",

    "there must be an efficient channel of angular momentum dissipation , otherwise the piled up angular momentum in the outer disc can cause instability of the disc and stops the accretion process .",
    "the sprinkler scenario provides a simple answer . the collision between jet and disc results in scattering matters off the disc , which should be in kepler motion around bh and hence carrying angular momentum .",
    "such a mass loss rate of the outer disc can be estimated by , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are mass and angular momentum of the disc respectively ( @xmath27 is the total number of baryons in the disc ) .",
    "if we use the angular momentum of the outermost ring to represent that of the whole disc , the mass loss rate reduces to @xmath28.\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the angular momentum of a proton .",
    "thus , a channel of dissipating angular momentum is set up , at a warped disc as shown in fig.@xmath4 .",
    "the jet - disc interaction dissipating the angular momentum can be calculated simply by the collision of relativistic leptons in the jet with the slow baryons in the outer disc , as shown in fig.@xmath30 .",
    "major parameters in the study of such a jet - disc collision are : the volume of the interaction zone , @xmath31 ; the number density of baryons ( dominantly protons ) in the outermost disc , @xmath32 ; the number density of leptons ( relativistic electrons ) in the jet , @xmath33 , which travel at speed , @xmath34 .",
    "the number of leptons scattered into a solid angle between @xmath35 and @xmath36 per unit time is given , @xmath37 the number of leptons ejected out from the jet per unit time is estimated , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a dimensionless coefficient , @xmath40 means accreted matter is totally ejected out . with an opening angle of jet , @xmath41 , as shown in fig.@xmath4 , we have @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "the change of linear momentum ( per unit time ) of leptons involving in collision is given , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the energy of a relativistic electron , with mass @xmath45 and lorentz factor @xmath46 .",
    "for simplicity , the rutherford scattering cross section @xcite , @xmath47 , is used , where @xmath48 is the energy of the scattering particle .",
    "although it is derived in the case of a repulsive scattering process , it is still a good approximation in the collision of the jet and disc .    since the collision occurs predominantly between electrons and protons , the interacting charges satisfy , @xmath49 . substituting eq.@xmath50 into the linear momentum change yields ,",
    "@xmath51    the mean force corresponding to the interaction is @xmath52 the number density of protons in the outermost ring is @xmath32 , each proton occupies a volume @xmath53 , the functional relationship between the impact parameter and the scattering angle is @xcite , @xmath54 . in such case , we have @xmath55 , the lower limit of the integral can be obtained by , @xmath56    integrating eq.@xmath57 , we get @xmath58\\sqrt { 2\\mathop m\\nolimits_e e } ( \\frac{{\\mathop e\\nolimits^2 } } { { 2e}}\\mathop ) \\nolimits^2 \\frac{{16{\\xi}\\dot m\\mathop n\\nolimits_p \\mathop v\\nolimits_i } } { { \\mathop m\\nolimits_p \\mathop r\\nolimits_0 ^ 2 \\mathop \\theta \\nolimits_0 ^ 2 } } , \\ ] ]    eq.@xmath59 corresponds to a torque , @xmath60 , which makes the jet to precess around the core at angular velocity , @xmath61 , determined by , @xmath62 , so that , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the precession period measured in the observer s reference frame , and @xmath65 is the spin angular momentum of the primary bh , with @xmath66 its dimensionless angular momentum . such a precession resembles a sprinkler , with water stream and impact arm replaced by the jet and the baryons at the outer disc respectively .",
    "thus , according to the collision process described by eq.@xmath50 to eq.@xmath67 , the mass loss rate , @xmath21 , required to precess the jet at the period , @xmath64 , is , @xmath68}},\\ ] ] where @xmath69 .",
    "fore simplicity , @xmath40 is assumed in the calculation of eq.@xmath70 .",
    "notice that @xmath71 of eq.@xmath70 represents mass loss rate of the relativistic jet , which is thought to be comparable to the accretion rate of eq.@xmath72 derived from the angular momentum transfer of a disc .",
    "the parameter spaces of @xmath71 , @xmath5 and @xmath73 corresponding to the two mechanisms given by eq.@xmath72 and eq.@xmath70 , can be displayed through the observational parameters of the seyfert 1 galaxy 3c 120 and the quasar 3c 345 , as shown in table @xmath74 .",
    "assuming @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , the cross area can be obtained as shown in fig.@xmath81 .",
    "notice that in fig.@xmath81 the inclined lines correspond to eq.@xmath70 ; and the solid vertical ones correspond to eq.@xmath72 in which @xmath82 is estimated under the binary model , with radius @xmath5 equivalent to the outer disc radius @xmath83 under the tidal torque @xcite .",
    "the shadowed area of fig.@xmath81 corresponds to an acceptable parameters of collision process , the predicted torque of which can precess the jet at a period of tens of years , which is expected by newtonian torque @xcite .",
    "the volume of the collision region is estimated , @xmath84 , the magnitude of which can be inferred from the cross of vertical lines ( correspond to different scenarios ) with the inclined lines of fig.@xmath81 .",
    "the shadowed area corresponds to the case that the 10yr precession period is driven by the newtonian torque , so that the size of the outermost ring of the disc can be estimated , @xmath85^{1/2}}$ ] , which is @xmath86 for 3c 120 , and @xmath87 for 3c 345 .",
    "in contrast , if the @xmath8810yr precession period originates in the lense - thirring precession in a single bh , the jet - disc collision results in a twisted outer ring of the disc . because the collision makes the liner momentum of baryons in the outer disc vary as fig.@xmath30 .",
    "such a twisting of outer ring apparently changes with the jet precession , so that the whole disc , inner and outer , varies at the precession rate dominated by the inner disc .",
    "as a result of the jet - disc collision , baryons in the outer disc scattered by high - speed leptons in jet spread around the collision site .",
    "the momentum and energy exchange between slow baryons and relativistic electrons are shown in fig.@xmath30 .",
    "the velocity distribution of scattered baryons can be calculated simply by the conservation of momentum , @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the lorenz factor of relativistic electrons , and @xmath91 , as shown in fig.@xmath30 , is the misalignment angle between the velocity of protons and the jet axis .    by eq.@xmath92 ,",
    "the velocity gained by a baryon at one collision , is @xmath93km@xmath94s , which is responsible for the velocity inferred from the doppler broadening of emission lines observed in agns .",
    "moreover , the jet - disc collision predicts a velocity distribution as shown in fig.@xmath95 , in which magnitude of velocity decreases with the increase of @xmath96 .",
    "such a velocity distribution of baryons predicts a bi - polar configuration of line emission .",
    "in fact , eq.@xmath92 is obtained ignoring the energy absorption by baryons , which can ionize the baryons . for simplicity",
    ", we can assume that a half of energy before collision is absorbed by the baryons , the magnitude of the baryon velocity @xmath97 of eq.@xmath92 , will be smaller .",
    "while in order of magnitude the conclusion drawn is unaffected .",
    "notice that the bi - polar corresponds to half opening angle of @xmath98 , and the smallest deflection angle @xmath99 is given by eq.@xmath100 .",
    "in fact , eq.@xmath92 predicts a correlation : the velocity of baryons inferred from line broadening of blr is inversely related to precession period of the jet .",
    "this is easy to understand .",
    "the more the linear momentum exchange between electrons of jet and the baryons of the disc , the more the momentum and energy gain for the baryons , so that they travel faster . on the other hand",
    ", this corresponds to larger action and reaction forces between jet and disc , and hence larger torque on the jet , so that the jet precesses more rapidly ( and shorter precession period ) .",
    "the rate of jet precession can be approximated , @xmath101 , which is so small that @xmath97 of eq.@xmath92 can be written , @xmath102 .",
    "the predicted correlation is supported by some agns with corresponding observations , as shown in table @xmath103 .",
    "besides interpreting the difficulties in angular momentum transfer and precession velocity of jet , a number of observations concerning blr likely favor the new model .",
    "firstly , the profiles of the broad lines observed at a high spectral resolution and signal - to - noise ratio , appear to be very smooth @xcite .",
    "the velocity distribution predicted by our model originates in the jet - disc collision , as shown in fig.@xmath95 , is automatically smooth .",
    "secondly , as shown in fig.@xmath4 , the new model actually implies a limited jet - disc interaction , in which only a small fraction of leptons in the jet is involved in the collision .",
    "once the jet plunges into the outer ring heavily , or touches part of inner rings , the collimated jet can be destroyed .",
    "this may explain the observations of radio quiet quasars , with the largest emission line width among agns , but weak in radio emission .",
    "obviously , when a torus is outside the bi - polar configuration of blr of an agn , then obscurity of the blr becomes more complicated .",
    "therefore , a los with a relatively small misalignment angle with the jet axis tends to observe single peaked emission line of blr , as some seyfert type 1 .    and if the misalignment between los and jet axis is relatively large , the obscurity depends on the angle of los with the normal direction of the outer ring . as shown in fig.@xmath4 ,",
    "a large misalignment is favorable to observe double - peaked blr , and a small one tends to be obscured , as seyfert type 2 ( which is absence of blr emission ) .",
    "thirdly , a number of authors @xcite have pointed out that local viscous dissipation in the line - emitting region of accretion disc does not provide enough power to account for the observed emission line luminosity .    apparently in our model this difficulty is naturally avoided . during the collision ,",
    "as shown in fig.@xmath4 , baryons at the collision sites ( or near ) gain energy and momentum ( linear ) , which can automatically ionize neutral hydrogen or other atoms .",
    "typically , a non - relativistic proton can absorb @xmath104ev in a head on collision with an electron of lorentz factor 10 in the jet , which can well account for the energy required for line emission of blr . and",
    "multi - collision processes can easily excite a hydrogen to uv band .",
    "moreover , if the jet contains certain fraction of baryons with a bulk lorentz factor of 10 also , their collisions with the baryons in the outer disc correspond to an energy exchange of @xmath104kev , which is responsible for the energy required to invoke the line emission of fe k@xmath3 .    because ngc 7213 displays very close speeds inferred from its blr and fe k@xmath3 lines , it is used as an evidence of blr origin for fe k@xmath3 line @xcite .    from the point of view of the jet - disc interaction , the cross section of the relativistic electrons in the jet with the non - relativistic hydrogen in the disc differs from that of relativistic protons in jet and non - relativistic iron in the disc .",
    "therefore , even if a source shows considerably discrepancy between speeds inferred from blr and fe k@xmath3 lines , the emission lines may still be originated at the same site of collision .",
    "so evidence of common origin should be found in luminosity , number density , absorbtion extracted from the two types of emission lines .",
    "consequently , all these issues are realized at the expense of a warped disc , which makes the jet - disc interaction possible .",
