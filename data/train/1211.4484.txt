    "brown dwarfs  substellar objects with masses below the hydrogen burning limit of 0.08@xmath1  are ideal to test the mass dependence of critical parameters in stellar evolution .",
    "one example for such a parameter is the lifetime of circumstellar disks , which is an important constraint for the core - accretion scenarios for planet formation .",
    "the disk lifetime is affected by a number of physical processes , e.g. disk ionisation by the central object and cosmic rays , accretion , grain growth ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our understanding of the relative importance of these processes and how they change with object mass is still incomplete , i.e. observational guidance is important to advance the theory .",
    "the clear majority of low - mass stars lose their disk within less than 5myr @xcite .",
    "maybe the best test for the longevity of disks is the upper scorpius ob assocation ( upsco in the following ) , the oldest nearby star forming region with a substantial number of brown dwarfs .",
    "upsco is often assumed to have an age of 5myr @xcite but recently @xcite have derived an older age of 10myr for this region . in upsco , @xcite derived a disk frequency of @xmath2% for f and g stars and @xmath3% for k0-m5 stars ( with 1@xmath4 binomial confidence intervals ) . the brown dwarfs in this region exhibit a disk fraction of @xmath5% , based on an examination of 35 objects @xcite .",
    "thus , the spitzer data tentatively shows that the disk fractions _ in upsco increase monotonically with decreasing object mass for early f- to late m - type objects_. this would imply a mass dependence in the disk evolution , resulting in long - lived disks in the substellar regime .",
    "so far , the brown dwarf disk frequency in upsco is affected by low number statistics . here",
    "we set out to test previous findings based on a much enlarged number of brown dwarfs in upsco , identified from ukidss . to identify the objects in our sample that have a disk ( class ii objects ) and those that do not ( class iii objects ) , we use data from the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise)@xcite . as will be shown , with improved statistics we find a disk fraction for brown dwarfs that is consistent with the value published for low - mass stars in this region ."
