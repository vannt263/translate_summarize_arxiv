    "superconformal algebras have a long history in mathematical physics , being intertwined with the development of string theory through their role as infinitesimal symmetries of superstrings ( see @xcite , for example ) , as well as appearing as extended symmetries of the scaling limits of certain lattice models @xcite .",
    "these infinite - dimensional lie superalgebras each contain a virasoro subalgebra that quantises the infinitesimal conformal symmetries of the plane .",
    "field - theoretically , the superconformal algebras are customarily parametrised by the number @xmath1 of fermionic partners of the energy - momentum tensor . the simplest examples , after the virasoro algebra itself ( corresponding to @xmath2 ) are the @xmath0 superconformal algebras : the _ neveu - schwarz algebra _ @xcite and the _ ramond algebra _ @xcite .",
    "after this debut in superstring theory and statistical mechanics , the structure theory for verma modules over the neveu - schwarz algebra was quickly settled .",
    "a determinant formula for their invariant bilinear forms , originally conjectured in @xcite , was proven in @xcite and the possible submodule structures were elucidated in @xcite with the result essentially repeating that of the virasoro algebra . in particular , all non - trivial submodules are generated by singular vectors , the dimension of the space of singular vectors in any weight space is at most one , and non - trivial homomorphisms between verma modules are necessarily injective .    by way of contrast",
    ", the structures of the ramond verma modules can be more intricate @xcite : submodules not generated by singular vectors can exist , there can be up to two linearly independent singular vectors of each parity in a given weight space , and there can exist non - trivial non - injective homomorphisms .",
    "these features of the ramond case are now relatively well understood , but serve as a useful toy model for the more pronounced difficulties that one encounters when investigating the verma modules of the @xmath3 superconformal algebras . despite the fact that the latter algebras have fundamental applications to mirror symmetry @xcite",
    ", the ads / cft correspondence @xcite and mathieu moonshine @xcite , it is fair to say that their representation theories remain poorly understood at best .    our purpose with this article is to explore some of the representation - theoretic aspects of the neveu - schwarz algebra that pertain to logarithmic conformal field theory .",
    "the more challenging exploration of the representations of the ramond algebra will be addressed in a sequel @xcite . here",
    ", the qualifier `` logarithmic '' means that the underlying vertex operator ( super)algebra admits modules upon which the virasoro zero mode @xmath4 acts non - semisimply . a collection of reviews on this topic may be found in @xcite .",
    "the results presented here are motivated by a recent lattice - theoretic study , reported in @xcite , although logarithmic conformal field theories with supersymmetry have been discussed in the past , see @xcite for example .",
    "this study proposes a conjecture , based on numerical evidence , that the scaling limits of a certain collection of integrable lattice models are described by logarithmic analogues of the @xmath0 superconformal minimal models . here",
    ", these logarithmic superconformal models are explored directly in the continuum , as conformal field theories .",
    "in particular , we study the fusion rules of a certain collection of neveu - schwarz modules that we will refer to as ( neveu - schwarz ) _",
    "kac modules_. this usage follows the nomenclature established in @xcite for kac modules over the virasoro algebra .",
    "the physical relevance of these modules is that they are believed @xcite to identify the scaling limits corresponding to an accessible class of integrable boundary conditions for the underlying lattice models . because of this , the continuum fusion rules for virasoro kac modules have been well studied both via lattice approximations @xcite and direct calculations @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the fusion rules of the @xmath0 kac modules only seem to have been studied from the lattice point of view @xcite , although those of the simple ( irreducible ) modules appearing in the @xmath0 minimal models have received continuum treatments , see @xcite for instance .",
    "we begin , in [ sec : back ] , by recalling the @xmath0 neveu - schwarz algebra and reviewing the necessary structure theory of its highest - weight modules and fock spaces .",
    "the latter are the superconformal analogues of the well known feigin - fuchs modules that appear in the coulomb gas free field realisation of the virasoro minimal models .",
    "their structure theory is detailed in @xcite .",
    "this theory is important for the present investigation because we define the @xmath0 neveu - schwarz kac modules as certain submodules of fock spaces , following @xcite in the virasoro case .",
    "when a conformal field theory is rational , meaning that the relevant modules of the underlying vertex operator algebra are semisimple and that only finitely many simple modules appear , the fusion rules may be efficiently computed using the verlinde formula @xcite . while rigorous proofs seem to require rationality , see @xcite , a lesson learned from more physical proofs @xcite is that this formula follows from the deeper consistency requirements of conformal field theory and so should be valid , in some form , more generally",
    ". in [ sec : verlinde ] , we utilise a continuous version of the verlinde formula to compute the characters of the fusion products of the kac modules .",
    "this approach was pioneered for logarithmic theories in @xcite and is now referred to as the standard module formalism .",
    "it has since been shown to yield correct ( or , at least , sensible ) results rather generally , see @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite in which general features of the standard module formalism are discussed .",
    "armed with this character information , we turn to the detailed structure of the fusion product of two kac modules .",
    "the additional structural data may be obtained , at least in certain examples , by explicitly constructing ( a truncation of ) the fusion product using the nahm - gaberdiel - kausch fusion algorithm @xcite . in [ sec : theexample ] , we detail an explicit example in order to illustrate how one typically employs this algorithm , noting that _ a priori _ knowledge of the fusion product s character can lead to significant simplifications .",
    "we also use this example to emphasise that completely identifying the result , up to isomorphism , may require computing additional indecomposability parameters @xcite , in particular the @xmath0 analogues of the logarithmic couplings of @xcite .",
    "moreover , we demonstrate that structural theorems for more general classes of neveu - schwarz modules may also be used to significantly simplify the identification of the fusion product .",
    "[ sec : results ] then summarises the fusion rules that we have obtained for neveu - schwarz kac modules by combining the nahm - gaberdiel - kausch fusion algorithm with the verlinde formula and neveu - schwarz structural theorems .",
    "an infinite family of fusion rules are subsequently conjectured and encoded in polynomial ring structures .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion that looks toward generalising these results to the ramond sector and outlines how the formalism being developed will contribute to our long term research goals .",
    "this is followed by three appendices .",
    "[ app : fusion ] provides a detailed derivation of the coproduct formulae that underlie the nahm - gaberdiel - kausch fusion algorithm and a description of the usage of the algorithm itself .",
    "while this material roughly follows @xcite , it makes the explicit computations in [ sec : theexample ] self - contained as well as prepares the reader for the rather more involved generalisation , detailed in @xcite , needed to discuss the ramond sector .",
    "[ app : stagmod ] then introduces the neveu - schwarz _ staggered modules _ , following @xcite and @xcite , that appear in certain fusion products .",
    "we prove a few basic structural results before reviewing the definition of logarithmic couplings and explaining how these parameters may be computed .",

    "second , applying the nahm - gaberdiel - kausch algorithm to depth @xmath147 indicated which composition factors were descendants of others and which were not , while the depth @xmath187 computation uncovered a rank @xmath209 jordan block for the action of @xmath4 and determined the corresponding logarithmic coupling .",
    "we also determined the parities of the indecomposable direct summands of the fusion product from these computations .",
    "third , the structure theory for staggered modules allowed us to completely fix the rest of the structure of the fusion product , except for one arrow in our diagrammatic representation of the structure that may or may not have been present .",
    "fourth , the presence of this arrow was confirmed by explicitly showing the non - existence of a singular vector , of the appropriate conformal weight , in the staggered module .",
    "the logic that led us to the structure of this fusion product is fairly typical .",
    "we have employed it to analyse many further examples of neveu - schwarz fusion products .",
    "the conclusions that we have drawn from these analyses are reported in the next section .",
    "in this section , we summarise the results that we have obtained by combining the character product rules with explicit nahm - gaberdiel - kausch fusion computations and the structure theory of staggered modules . as was explained in the previous section , this combination allows us to significantly reduce the depth to which the fusion algorithm must be applied in order to completely identify the product . for brevity , we have only considered fusion rules between kac modules , restricting to the central charges @xmath252 , @xmath253 , @xmath254 , @xmath147 , @xmath255 and @xmath256 , corresponding to @xmath257 , @xmath258 , @xmath259 , @xmath260 , @xmath261 and @xmath262 , respectively .",
    "the results obtained suggest conjectures for certain classes of general kac fusion rules which we describe below .",
    "perhaps the simplest kac module fusion products are those involving a `` first row '' module and a `` first column '' one . in this case",
    ", the proposed fusion formalism for the underlying lattice models @xcite requires the following fusion rule for consistency : @xmath265 this is certainly consistent with the corresponding character product rule and we have verified it explicitly , using the nahm - gaberdiel - kausch algorithm , in many cases ( see below ) .",
    "the evidence is , in our opinion , sufficient to conjecture that holds in complete generality . whilst this accords with the proposed lattice fusion calculations , we view the result as also confirming , indirectly , that we have made the correct abstract definition for kac modules .",
    "we remark that when confirming the fusion product , the case in which @xmath90 is a corner type module , hence is semisimple , is the most computationally intensive . to explicitly verify that each composition factor splits off as a direct sum , thereby forming the required collection of islands ( as indicated in [ fig : kacstructures ] ) , we must compute to the depth given by the maximal difference between the conformal weights of consecutive composition factors ( when they are ordered by their conformal weight ) .",
    "this quickly becomes infeasible with our implementation as @xmath34 and @xmath35 grow , so the direct evidence for corner type modules is somewhat less compelling than for the other cases .",
    "we also note here that the computational complexity of the fusion algorithm means that we were only able to successfully confirm when the required depth was at most @xmath266 .",
    "however , as @xmath60 or @xmath61 increases , the labels @xmath34 and @xmath35 requiring a given depth calculation tend to increase leading to an overall steady decrease in the feasible depths due to the increasing complexity of the singular vectors for high @xmath34 and @xmath35 . for @xmath267 and @xmath262 ,",
    "we were therefore limited to depths at most @xmath209 .    including",
    "parity in the fusion rule is easy : in each case , explicit computation confirms that @xmath268 more generally , if the parities of @xmath269 and @xmath270 coincide ( differ ) , then that of @xmath90 will be even ( odd ) .",
    "this observation does not appear to have a simple explanation in terms of the fusion algorithm , although it is in accord with the well known principle of conservation of fermion numbers .",
    "we will show in @xcite that it follows readily from a fermionic version of the verlinde formula . from the lattice",

    "the verlinde formula tells us that the character is that of @xmath112 which means that the fusion product has two composition factors , @xmath189 and @xmath272 . however , there are three inequivalent structural possibilities : @xmath192{0.3\\textwidth } { \\begin{tikzpicture}[->,node distance=1cm , scale = 0.8 , transform shape,>=stealth',semithick ]    \\node[main node ] ( 1 ) { } ;    \\node[main node ] ( 1a ) [ below of=1 ] { } ;    \\path [ ] ( 1 ) edge ( 1a ) ;    \\node[sv ] ( 2 ) [ right = 1.5 cm of 1 ] { } ;    \\node[sv ] ( 2a ) [ right = 1.5 cm of 1a ] { } ;    \\path [ ] ( 2a ) edge ( 2 ) ;    \\node[sv ] ( 3 ) [ right = 1.5 cm of 2 ] { } ;    \\node[sv ] ( 3a ) [ right = 1.5 cm of 2a ] { } ;    \\node ( 0 ) [ left = 1 cm of 1 ] { $ \\tfrac{1}{2}$ : } ;    \\node      [ below of=0 ] { $ 3 $ : } ; \\end{tikzpicture } \\ .}\\]]the",

    "hence does not appear at depth @xmath147 .",

    "we remark that one can derive this result from the isomorphism @xmath394 ( specific to this model ) , the conjectured fusion rule , and the definition of corner type kac modules .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath395 of course , semisimplicity also proves that the character product lifts to the fusion rule , when @xmath308 .",
    "it follows , in particular , that the kac modules form a closed fusion ring , without the need to introduce any staggered modules .",
    "this does not mean , however , that staggered modules do not exist at @xmath308 .",
    "for example , one can construct staggered self - extensions of every ( simple ) neveu - schwarz kac module @xmath270 , with @xmath396 , by following the arguments of ( * ? ? ?",

    "the results presented in this article demonstrate that the paradigm of fusion product computations using the nahm - gaberdiel - kausch algorithm is as successful for the neveu - schwarz algebra as for the virasoro algebra .",
    "in particular , our computations have allowed us to formulate several conjectures for kac module fusion rules in the logarithmic @xmath0 superconformal minimal models .",
    "we have seen that staggered neveu - schwarz modules , upon which @xmath4 has rank @xmath209 jordan blocks , are readily encountered and that more complicated indecomposable modules can be generated on which @xmath4 has rank @xmath212 blocks .",
    "these results provide , among other things , strong evidence for the conjectures made in @xcite from numerical lattice - theoretic studies . on the other hand",
    ", the reader may have noticed that our results and conjectures bear a striking resemblance to their counterparts for the virasoro algebra , see @xcite .",
    "this accords with expectations , as there are many instances in which the representation theories of the neveu - schwarz and virasoro algebras mirror one another .    from this point of view",
    ", the key advance made in this paper is not so much the explicit results themselves , but rather the development of the formalism that led to them .",
    "this should be understood in the context of the extension of this formalism , to include the ramond algebra , that will appear in @xcite . in this case , the standard module development that led to the logarithmic verlinde formula will need to be generalised to accommodate supercharacters , ultimately resulting in a fermionic verlinde formula generalising that of @xcite .",
    "more tellingly , the nahm - gaberdiel - kausch fusion algorithm will require significant modifications because the ramond sector , consisting of twisted modules , forces one to deal with non - integer field - theoretic monodromies .",
    "the required changes have been partially addressed in @xcite , but this work requires refinement ( and simplification ) before the twisted version of this algorithm can be efficiently coded and utilised .",
    "let us recall that the representation theory of the ramond algebra can be significantly more involved than that of the virasoro or neveu - schwarz algebras .",
    "in particular , the relation @xmath397 means that @xmath398 may act nilpotently , hence possibly non - semisimply , on weight spaces .",
    "such a non - semisimple @xmath398-action is observed , for example , on the ramond verma module of highest - weight @xmath399 . because it seems that the majority of the difficulties in the ramond sector may be traced back to this observation , and because nilpotent actions are the norm for the odd generators of the @xmath3 superconformal algebras , it is reasonable to regard the @xmath0 ramond sector as a non - trivial , but accessible , toy model for the representation theory of these important superalgebras .",
    "this gives a separate motivation for studying logarithmic @xmath0 models : they give us an idea of what one can expect in the @xmath3 case .",
    "as logarithmic behaviour is now recognised to be generic ( rather than pathological ) for conformal field theories , it makes sense to look for logarithmic structures when investigating poorly understood representation theories .",
    "models , see @xcite . ]",
    "we mention that such superconformal algebra studies fit rather naturally into a bigger research programme that is currently being actively pursued ( see @xcite for further details ) . here",
    ", the point is that the superconformal algebras may be naturally constructed as quantum hamiltonian reductions of certain affine lie superalgebras @xcite . for the @xmath0 superconformal algebras , the corresponding affine lie superalgebra is @xmath400 .",
    "the conformal field theories corresponding to these affine superalgebras are expected to be logarithmic , in general , and the relatively tractable affine symmetry suggests that these theories will be very valuable for understanding general logarithmic behaviour .",
    "unfortunately , little is known about these models ( but see @xcite ) . a more thorough understanding of these affine theories is therefore warranted and we expect that the structural features of the logarithmic superconformal models will aid in this undertaking ( and vice - versa ) .",
    "this work also relates to affine models through the celebrated coset construction of goddard , kent and olive @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the simple modules of the @xmath0 minimal models arise when considering admissible highest - weight modules @xcite of the @xmath401 components of the coset . however , as proposed in @xcite , one expects to similarly realise @xmath0 kac modules , in particular , by extending these considerations to the analogues of kac modules over @xmath401 .",
    "as this approach is also applicable to the infinite hierarchy of extended minimal models @xcite , this will give important insight into their logarithmic counterparts .",
    "these ideas are also currently being actively pursued .    finally , it would be of interest to explore whether our results admit a w - extended picture , generalising the situation @xcite for the virasoro logarithmic minimal models . from the lattice",

    "in this appendix , we review an algorithmic approach to fusion that was proposed by nahm @xcite and then significantly generalised by gaberdiel and kausch @xcite . this approach aims to construct the fusion product of two ( vertex operator algebra ) modules by realising it as a vector space , in fact as a quotient of the vector space tensor product of the modules being fused , upon which the chiral algebra acts through explicitly given coproduct formulae .",
    "these formulae are deduced from fairly straight - forward manipulations involving operator product expansions @xcite and the aforementioned quotient corresponds to imposing the condition that two seemingly different means of arriving at these coproduct formulae actually give identical results .",
    "as we will see , this imposition follows from the mutual locality requirement for conformal fields .",
    "the algorithm that has come to be known as nahm - gaberdiel - kausch fusion then observes that this tensor product realisation can be consistently truncated so as to explicitly construct only a quotient , preferably a finite - dimensional one , of the fusion product vector space .",
    "it is often the case that one can completely identify a given fusion product by analysing the coproduct action on a sufficiently large truncation .",
    "this allows one to perform fusion calculations explicitly with a computer algebra system .",
    "there are several advantages to this approach to fusion over traditional approaches , the most important of which is that it facilitates the exploration of the new classes of representations that fusion produces .",
    "for example , the result of fusing two simple modules need not be a direct sum of simple modules in general ; in fact , the fusion product need not even be highest - weight .",
    "the main disadvantage is that the algorithm amounts to a computationally intensive brute force construction and is therefore not well suited for general fusion calculations or theoretical studies .",
    "there is also the issue of determining when one has determined all of the so - called _ spurious states_. the algorithm itself does not guarantee termination here , so it is important to be able to check this independently . in this article",
    ", we employ a verlinde formula for this purpose ; in some cases , one can instead use correlation function computations to confirm the result _ a posteriori_.    readers who are already familiar with the nahm - gaberdiel - kausch fusion algorithm , as introduced in @xcite , will find little that is new here , though they may wish to skim what follows in order to familiarise themselves with our notation and nomenclature .",
    "the neveu - schwarz supersymmetry does lead to the appearance of additional signs , as one expects with a graded tensor product , but the ideas and implementation follow the bosonic case . on the other hand , fusing with a ramond module requires significant modifications to the algorithm .",
    "we shall defer a detailed discussion of these modifications to @xcite .",
    "here , we review the derivation , following @xcite , of the coproduct formulae that define the action of the chiral algebra on the fusion product .",
    "we provide almost all of the details because the generalisation to the twisted sector , necessary for ramond fusion , is significantly more involved .",
    "in fact , our treatment of the twisted case , which will be reported in @xcite , simplifies the known formulae @xcite considerably .",
    "we mention that the derivation for negative modes is only valid in the limit when one of the insertion points is sent to zero .",
    "this is not important for practical purposes , but is expected to be relevant to demonstrating that these fusion coproducts define a tensor structure on appropriate categories of vertex operator algebra modules .",
    "let @xmath402 be chiral fields of conformal weight @xmath403 whose mode expansions take the form @xmath404 for the purposes of this article , the relevant fields are @xmath15 , with @xmath405 , and @xmath16 , with @xmath406 . in what follows",
    ", we will omit the index @xmath355 labelling the chiral field for simplicity .",
    "we also introduce arbitrary fields @xmath407 and @xmath408 that are local with respect to @xmath409 : @xmath410 here , @xmath411 is the mutual locality index of @xmath412 with @xmath413 ( this index also depends on @xmath412 ; the notation likewise keeps this implicit for simplicity ) .",
    "we deduce coproduct formulae for fusion by determining the natural action of the modes @xmath414 on the ( radially ordered ) products @xmath415 .",
    "this will define an action of the @xmath414 on the tensor product of the corresponding states @xmath416 , the latter being interpreted ( after quotienting ) as a state in the fusion product .",
    "the starting point of the computation is the contour integral @xmath417 where the contour @xmath418 encloses @xmath147 , @xmath177 and @xmath419 , @xmath420 is the vacuum , and @xmath421 is an arbitrary spectator state .",
    "we remark that @xmath421 may even depend on other insertion points , noting that because of radial ordering , such insertion points are not enclosed by @xmath418 .",
    "we will assume that the fields @xmath407 and @xmath408 correspond to untwisted representations of the chiral algebra , referring to @xcite for the twisted case .",
    "in other words , their operator product expansions with @xmath409 are characterised by modes @xmath422 with @xmath423 : @xmath424 inserting these operator product expansions into , we see that there are no branch cuts in the integrand .",
    "we may therefore split the contour into three simple contours around each of the ( potential ) singularities @xmath177 , @xmath419 and @xmath147",
    ". the residue at @xmath177 is computed by substituting the operator product expansion of @xmath409 and @xmath407 : @xmath425 the residue at @xmath419 is similarly computed , though we must first apply before we are able to substitute the operator product expansion @xmath426 : @xmath427 note that follows readily from upon swapping @xmath177 with @xmath419 and then making the replacements @xmath428 and @xmath429 .    if @xmath430 , then the integrand of has no pole at @xmath431 and the coproduct formula for @xmath414 is just @xmath432 } \\qquad \\text{(\\(n { \\geqslant}-h+1\\)).}\\ ] ] here , we have extracted the action of @xmath422 on the fields in the correlator so that , for example , @xmath433 it should be clear now why we have insisted on the spectator state @xmath421 even though it plays no role whatsoever in the analysis .",
    "if @xmath434 , then there is a pole at @xmath431 and we can evaluate the corresponding residue by using either operator product expansion :    @xmath435    we remark that @xmath230 is supposed to make a small circle around @xmath147 , while inserting the appropriate operator product expansion requires that @xmath230 be close to either @xmath177 or @xmath419 .",
    "we conclude that is only valid when @xmath177 is close to @xmath147 whereas is only valid when @xmath419 is close to @xmath147 .",
    "we will later send @xmath177 or @xmath419 to @xmath147 to arrive at a simplified form for the fusion coproducts .    evaluating the integral in",
    ", we see that the @xmath431 contribution to the fusion coproduct @xmath436 , with @xmath434 , takes the form @xmath437 here , we have used the binomial coefficient identity @xmath438 which is valid when @xmath439 and @xmath434 .",
    "it is clear that the first sum on the right - hand side of precisely cancels the contribution from @xmath440 , when @xmath434 .",
    "similarly , starting from the evaluation of shows that the contribution from @xmath441 is cancelled .    in this way , we arrive at _ two _ formulae for the fusion coproduct of @xmath414 with @xmath434 :    @xmath442    of course , these formulae should coincide in some sense .",
    "however , they are only supposed to be valid when @xmath177 or @xmath419 is small , respectively , so we make the substitutions @xmath443 and @xmath444 in the first and @xmath445 and @xmath446 in the second to obtain    @xmath447    we remark that we can set @xmath448 or @xmath449 in the first or second coproduct formula above because the binomial coefficient @xmath450 vanishes if @xmath451 .",
    "we would not have been able to make these simplifications if the residue at @xmath431 did not partially cancel the contribution from @xmath440 or @xmath441 .",
    "to summarise , the fusion coproduct formulae ( for untwisted representations ) may be expressed as    [ eq : untwcoprods ] @xmath452    these formulae are related by translation : @xmath453 using @xmath454 } = { \\bigl ( -h+1-n \\bigr ) } s_{n-1}$ ] , we derive inductively the following formulae : @xmath455 consequently , one has @xmath456 which leads to the three _",
    "master equations _ for untwisted fusion :    [ eq : master ] @xmath457    here , we let @xmath175 denote @xmath458 for brevity . in practice , such as when performing the explicit computations reported in this work , we would set @xmath241 to @xmath48 to further simplify these formulae . however , this masks the natural grading of these formulae by conformal weight in the same way that choosing insertion points masks the conformal grading of operator product expansions .",
    "we remark that the interpretation of fusion as a quotient of the ( vector space ) tensor product is captured in [ eq : translation ] .",
    "this formula is actually a requirement imposed by the locality of operator product expansions on the coproduct formulae .",
    "thus , we may define the fusion product ( as a vector space ) of two chiral algebra modules @xmath459 and @xmath1 to be the quotient @xmath460 where the ideal is the sum of the images for all chiral modes @xmath414 ( and all @xmath241 ) .",
    "of course , this is the same as the intersection of the corresponding kernels .",
    "the point is that @xmath461 is defined to be the _",
    "largest _ quotient of @xmath462 upon which the coproduct actions coincide .",
    "we expect that this can be interpreted as a universality property for fusion as is imposed in @xcite .",
    "finally , we remark that the cancellation between the contributions to the integral from the residues at @xmath431 and @xmath440 or @xmath441 is best understood analytically in terms of the regularity of the integrand at infinity . explicitly , if we use the operator product expansion @xmath463 , then the sum of the contributions is , for fixed @xmath439 and @xmath434 , proportional to the integral @xmath464 } { { \\mathopen{}\\mathclose\\bgroup\\originalleft } ( z - w_1 { \\aftergroup\\egroup\\originalright})}^{-m - h } z^{n+h-1 } \\ : \\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}z}{2 \\pi { \\mathfrak{i } } } & = -\\oint_{\\infty } { { \\mathopen{}\\mathclose\\bgroup\\originalleft } ( z - w_1 { \\aftergroup\\egroup\\originalright})}^{-m - h } z^{n+h-1 } \\ : \\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}z}{2 \\pi { \\mathfrak{i } } } \\notag \\\\ & = \\oint_0 { { \\mathopen{}\\mathclose\\bgroup\\originalleft } ( 1 - w_1 y { \\aftergroup\\egroup\\originalright})}^{-m - h } y^{m - n-1 } \\ : \\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}y}{2 \\pi { \\mathfrak{i } } } \\notag \\\\ & = 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because @xmath465 . in the above derivation",
    ", we have chosen to instead derive the cancellation of these contributions algebraically , using binomial coefficient identities , because this method readily generalises to the twisted sector @xcite , whereas the contour analysis becomes rather more subtle there due to the presence of branch cuts .",
    "one important insight @xcite into the definition of the fusion product is that it admits consistent truncations which are easier to construct explicitly . for this , we consider subalgebras @xmath466 of the universal enveloping algebra of the chiral algebra .",
    "one important example is that generated by all the chiral modes with index not greater than minus their conformal weight : @xmath467 for the neveu - schwarz algebra , this subalgebra is generated by the @xmath5 , with @xmath166 , and the @xmath20 , with @xmath167 .",
    "the second example , actually a family of examples labelled by @xmath468 , that we shall employ is that spanned by monomials of weight greater than @xmath469 in the chiral modes : @xmath470 the integer @xmath469 will be referred to as the depth .",
    "the ability to consistently truncate the fusion product amounts to the following claim @xcite for the chiral algebra modules @xmath459 and @xmath1 : @xmath471 the first factor on the right - hand side defines the _ special subspace _",
    "@xmath472 of @xmath459 and the second factor defines the depth @xmath469 subspace @xmath473 of @xmath1 ( even though both are defined as quotients ) .",
    "the claim is therefore succinctly expressed as the inclusion @xmath474 .",
    "we remark that fusion is commutative , so one may swap the roles of @xmath459 and @xmath1 if desired .",
    "the proof of the claim amounts to showing that any @xmath475 representing the left - hand side may be written as a linear combination of elements of the right - hand side by using the master coproduct formulae .",
    "this is demonstrated through the following algorithm which is applied , at each step , to each term @xmath475 of the result of the previous step :    * if @xmath476 , so @xmath477 , with @xmath478 , then , perhaps followed by , may be used to replace @xmath475 by a linear combination of terms of the form @xmath479 and @xmath480 , where @xmath481 .",
    "repeat until none of the resulting terms @xmath475 have @xmath477 , with @xmath478 .",
    "one may need to take into account relations in @xmath459 to arrive at terms with @xmath482 . * if @xmath483 , so @xmath484 , where @xmath244 is a monomial in the chiral modes of weight greater than @xmath469 , then combine @xmath485 , coming from the left - hand side of , with and to replace @xmath475 by a linear combination of terms of the form @xmath486 , where the @xmath487 are monomials in the chiral modes of weight strictly smaller than that of @xmath244 . repeat until each of the resulting terms have @xmath488 , using relations in @xmath1 .",
    "* repeat the above two steps as required .",
    "termination is guaranteed for modules whose weights are bounded below over a large class of chiral algebras , the neveu - schwarz algebra included , because each step requires that the sum of the weights of the factors in each term strictly decreases .",
    "we remark that these steps are also used when computing fusion products to a given depth @xmath469 .",
    "an explicit example illustrating this is detailed in [ sec : theexample ] .",
    "the first goal in constructing a depth @xmath469 fusion product @xmath489 is to determine the subspace of @xmath490 with which it may be identified .",
    "this determination proceeds through the identification of _ spurious states _ which are actually relations in the tensor product space that are derived from relations in @xmath459 and @xmath1 ( or even in the chiral algebra ) .",
    "specifically , one combines @xmath485 , for monomials of weight greater than @xmath469 , with these relations ; a spurious state arises if reducing the result to an element of @xmath490 using the above algorithm does not yield zero identically .",
    "we again refer to [ sec : theexample ] for examples of this process . quotienting by the spurious states then gives the fusion product to depth @xmath469 .",
    "once the depth @xmath469 fusion product has been identified , its structure is analysed by computing the action of the chiral modes @xmath414 with @xmath491 ( all other chiral modes must act as the zero operator ) . for this",
    ", one applies the coproduct formulae and to a basis element of the depth @xmath469 fusion product , reducing the result to an element of @xmath490 using the above algorithm , then to an element of @xmath492 by imposing the spurious state relations . by analysing the structures obtained for various ( small ) values of @xmath469",
    ", one gets highly non - trivial information about the fusion product itself ; in favourable cases , the information obtained is sufficient to completely identify the fusion product .",
    "the example of [ sec : theexample ] illustrates such a case .",
    "staggered modules form a particular class of indecomposable modules upon which the virasoro zero mode @xmath4 acts non - semisimply . in a sense , they form the simplest class of such modules and they are responsible for the logarithmic structure of most of the best understood logarithmic conformal field theories . the term was introduced for virasoro modules in @xcite , where some classification results were reported , shortly after the first examples had been exhibited @xcite .",
    "a full classification of staggered modules over the virasoro algebra was completed in @xcite .",
    "this notion has been recently developed @xcite for other chiral algebras , though only a few results have been proven at this level of generality . in this appendix",
    ", we discuss the situation for the neveu - schwarz superconformal algebra and explain the results that we use in the course of identifying the fusion products reported in [ sec : results ] .",
    "one particularly important feature of staggered modules is that they are generally not determined , up to isomorphism , by the structural diagrams commonly used to depict them . in the simplest examples over the virasoro algebra ,",
    "one requires an additional parameter @xmath493 to fix the isomorphism class completely .",
    "this was first recognised in @xcite , but a general invariant definition of @xmath493 does not seem to have appeared until @xcite , where it was christened the _",
    "logarithmic coupling_. other commonly used nomenclature for @xmath493 includes `` beta - invariant '' @xcite and `` indecomposability parameter '' @xcite . here",
    ", we define logarithmic couplings for the neveu - schwarz algebra and describe the methods we use to compute these parameters in this paper .",
    "a staggered module is normally defined to be an extension of highest - weight modules upon which @xmath4 acts non - semisimply . given the results reported here , and in @xcite , we believe that it will be necessary to generalise this to extensions of kac modules .",
    "however , most of the rigorous results @xcite about staggered modules were proven for extensions of highest - weight modules over the virasoro algebra and we expect that these results will lift to the neveu - schwarz algebra without difficulty",
    ". moreover , the simplest kac modules are also highest - weight modules , so that many of the staggered modules we explicitly analyse will be of highest - weight type .",
    "we will therefore make use of virasoro results , lifted to the neveu - schwarz algebra , that apply to highest - weight type staggered modules , deferring rigorous proofs of these lifts to a future publication .",
    "let us therefore define a _ neveu - schwarz staggered module _ to be an extension of a kac module by another kac module upon which @xmath4 acts non - semisimply .",
    "the short exact sequence characterising the staggered module @xmath494 is then @xmath495 where the injection @xmath496 and surjection @xmath497 are neveu - schwarz module homomorphisms .",
    "we will customarily label the staggered module with two sets of indices @xmath498 such that the kac quotient is @xmath499 and the kac submodule is @xmath500 . in the above exact sequence ,",
    "we would therefore write @xmath501 we remark that this labelling need not completely specify the staggered module up to isomorphism .",
    "when necessary , we shall append the required additional labels in parentheses ; for example , @xmath502 .",
    "we also mention that the staggered modules @xmath498 that we have encountered in our fusion computations all have either @xmath503 or @xmath504",
    ". however , staggered modules with both @xmath505 and @xmath506 non - zero do exist .",
    "most of the staggered modules analysed in this paper have the property that both the kac submodule and quotient appearing in are highest - weight modules ( an example where this is not the case is discussed in [ sec : away ] ) . in this case",
    ", we have the following result .",
    "if the kac modules @xmath507 and @xmath508 in are highest - weight , then their minimal conformal weights must satisfy @xmath509 and @xmath510 .",
    "if this condition on the minimal conformal weights is not met , then there is no staggered module @xmath494 making exact .",
    "the requirement that the kac modules be highest - weight is necessary as the example discussed in [ sec : away ] shows .",
    "in contrast , the following results hold for general staggered modules .",
    "the jordan blocks of @xmath4 , acting on @xmath494 , have rank at most @xmath209 .",
    "let @xmath160 belong to a jordan block for @xmath4 where the ( generalised ) eigenvalue is @xmath25 .",
    "then , @xmath511 need not be zero , but @xmath512 , since @xmath513 belongs to the kac module @xmath514 . by exactness , @xmath515 for some @xmath516 , hence @xmath517 .",
    "it follows from this proposition , and the definition , that the action of @xmath4 on a staggered module always possesses jordan blocks of rank @xmath209 .",
    "[ prop : stagann ] let @xmath518 be elements of a rank @xmath209 jordan block for @xmath4 satisfying @xmath519 . if @xmath246 is annihilated by some @xmath244 in the universal enveloping algebra of the neveu - schwarz algebra , then @xmath520 . in particular , if @xmath521 is singular of conformal weight @xmath25 , then @xmath241 is singular or zero in @xmath522 .",
    "we may assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath244 is homogeneous , meaning that @xmath523 } = -n u$ ] for some @xmath524 .",
    "since @xmath525 , we have @xmath526 by exactness , hence @xmath527 is an eigenvector of @xmath4 with eigenvalue @xmath528 .",
    "thus , @xmath529 .",
    "the last statement now follows by combining this result for @xmath530 with that for @xmath244 a positive mode .",
    "note that if @xmath514 is highest - weight with highest - weight vector @xmath246 of conformal weight @xmath25 , then @xmath531 can not be @xmath147 if there are to be any jordan blocks at all .",
    "it follows that , in this case , @xmath241 is singular .      in this section ,",
    "we assume that the kac submodule and quotient of each staggered module is highest - weight . with this restriction",
    ", we can follow @xcite in discussing parametrisations of the isomorphism classes of the staggered modules with @xmath90 and @xmath514 fixed .",
    "the parametrisations for general staggered modules are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "when the highest - weight vectors of the ( highest - weight ) modules @xmath90 and @xmath514 have equal conformal weight , @xmath532 , then this sequence determines the staggered module up to isomorphism ( assuming that it exists ) .",
    "this follows easily from the fact that such staggered modules are quotients ( * ? ? ?",
    "4.7 ) of universal `` verma - like '' staggered modules .",
    "however , the exact sequence typically does not determine the isomorphism class uniquely when @xmath533 .",
    "this seems to have been first recognised in the virasoro examples constructed in @xcite , where an additional parameter @xmath534 was introduced to specify the module structure .",
    "the claim that this parameter determines the isomorphism class was subsequently demonstrated for a class of verma - like virasoro staggered modules in @xcite . extending this work to general virasoro",
    "staggered modules required a general invariant definition of @xmath534 @xcite and was completed in @xcite .",
    "the staggered modules typically encountered in fusion computations have the following structure : let @xmath221 denote the highest - weight vector of the submodule @xmath535 and let @xmath536 denote its singular descendant of conformal weight @xmath537 ( unique up to rescaling ) .",
    "the existence of @xmath241 is guaranteed by [ prop : stagann ] , so we may choose @xmath242 such that @xmath538 .",
    "it follows that @xmath539 must be proportional to @xmath221 and we define @xcite this constant to be the _ logarithmic coupling _",
    "the choice of @xmath242 is generally only unique up to adding elements of @xmath535 ( with conformal weight @xmath537 ) ; however , these are annihilated by @xmath540 as @xmath541 is singular .",
    "the logarithmic coupling is therefore independent of such choices once we fix a normalisation for the singular vector @xmath241 .",
    "for the neveu - schwarz algebra , it is not hard to show that the coefficient of the monomial involving only @xmath149 is non - zero @xcite , hence we let @xmath542 with the ( antilinear ) adjoint generated by @xmath543 and @xmath544 , we see that renormalising @xmath241 by a factor of @xmath210 leads to a renormalisation of @xmath534 by a factor of @xmath545 .",
    "we will often denote the logarithmic coupling of a staggered module @xmath498 , obtained from fusion calculations , by @xmath546 for convenience .",
    "logarithmic couplings are therefore fundamental representation - theoretic quantities .",
    "their physical interest in logarithmic conformal field theory lies in the fact that they also appear in the coefficients of certain operator product expansions and correlation functions , often accompanied by the factors with logarithmic singularities .",
    "one can compute the value of any logarithmic coupling by explicitly constructing the staggered module to sufficient depth as in the nahm - gaberdiel - kausch fusion algorithm .",
    "however , this is , computationally , very intensive .",
    "an alternative method proposed in @xcite , but typically limited to staggered modules involving braid type highest - weight modules , is to consider staggered modules for which the quotient @xmath514 is replaced by its verma cover .",
    "the desired staggered module may then be realised as a quotient of the verma - like one if the latter possesses a singular vector of the appropriate conformal weight .",
    "checking explicitly for the existence of such a singular vector fixes @xmath534 ( in the braid type case ) ; see @xcite for the proofs .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the most efficient means of computing the logarithmic coupling in a fusion product is the field - theoretic , though somewhat heuristic , method outlined in @xcite ( noting the important clarifications described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "this builds on earlier work @xcite addressing the so - called `` @xmath547 catastrophe '' that is reviewed in @xcite .",
