    "the many - body quantum states in ultracold gases have been studied with a high interest , because there are many parameters that can be adjusted in experiments to control the static state as well as the dynamics of the system . as a paradigm model , bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in a double - well system provides a useful setup to tackle the properties of quantum systems . by loading ultracold atoms in double wells",
    ", one can study fundamental quantum mechanical effects and many important quantum many - body phenomena , for example interferometry @xcite , quantum information processing @xcite , quantum phase transition @xcite , quantum superposition state @xcite , josephson oscillations and nonlinear self - trapping form of dynamics @xcite .",
    "recently , it was found that in some ultracold gas systems ( such as rotating bec and bec in double wells with very small tilt ) , the ground state transition can not be described by the mean - field theory , although the ground states before and after transition are consistent with the mean - field description very well @xcite .",
    "this is because in the transition region , the ground state is no longer a product of single - particle states but a strongly - correlated entangled state .",
    "how to characterize such states is under intensive study .",
    "moreover , in refs .",
    "@xcite , the system sizes under study are not too large .",
    "the property of quantum correlation in the transition region for larger system is an interesting problem .",
    "the appearance of quantum correlation in the ground state in the transition region makes it reasonable to use some tools borrowed from quantum information theory to investigate the transition . in this article",
    ", our goal is to use fidelity susceptibility and quantum correlation to study the ground state transition of bec in double wells with an arbitrary tilt . in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we introduce the model and give the prediction of the ground state transition according to the semiclassical picture . in sec .",
    "[ fs ] , we calculate the fidelity susceptibility which can precisely locate the critical point of a possibly unknown quantum transition @xcite",
    ". different behaviors of the fidelity susceptibility under different tilts are found . in sec . [ qd ] ,",
    "enlightened by the fact that entanglement can also show a rather interesting behavior at the critical point of a quantum transition @xcite , we calculate two quantities of quantum correlation : total correlation and quantum discord , both of which can exhibit signatures of the quantum transitions @xcite",
    ". moreover , quantum discord can appear even when entanglement is absent @xcite so it is a more suitable quantity than entanglement to characterize the quantumness of the correlation .",
    "we find that both total correlation and quantum discord are nonzero in the transition region , but their values decrease with the particle number . by doing a finite - size analysis , an exponential decay of them with the particle number",
    "this means although for a small system the transition is dominated by the quantum correlation , for a very large system no quantum correlation exists during the transition .",

    "the single level bose - hubbard hamiltonian for @xmath3 atoms in a double - well system can be written as @xmath4\\nonumber\\\\ & -&v_{0}(\\hat{n}_{l}-\\hat{n}_{r } ) , \\label{h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) creates ( annihilates ) a boson in the @xmath7-th well ( @xmath8 ) , @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the tunneling energy and @xmath11 is the on - site interaction [ a positive ( negative ) @xmath11 corresponds to attractive ( repulsive ) atom - atom interaction ] .",
    "@xmath12 is the tilt which can destroy the left - right symmetry and is non - zero in real experiments .",
    "we set @xmath13 for convenience and only consider @xmath14 in this paper .",
    "the above hamiltonian can be diagonalized in the @xmath15-dimensional fock space spanned by @xmath16 .",
    "the dynamics of the system is controlled by the parameter @xmath17 .",
    "as @xmath18 passes from the weak region to the fermionization limit , the dynamics of these atoms which are initially prepared mostly in one well , will change from josephson oscillation ( simply tunneling back and forth between two potential wells ) to self - trapping above a critical interaction strength @xcite . moreover , the static properties of the system , such as the ground state , are also closely related to @xmath18 .",
    "we can replace the operators @xmath6 with @xmath19 numbers @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) to obtain a semiclassical hamiltonian @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 characterizing the imbalance . to minimize the energy ,",
    "it is obvious that @xmath24 should be zero .",
    "then , for each @xmath25 and @xmath18 , we can find the position @xmath26 of the local minimum of eq .",
    "( [ ch ] ) by solving @xmath27 . for @xmath28 , at a critical @xmath29 , @xmath26 increases from 0 abruptly , giving a hint of quantum transition of the ground state .",
    "in this section , by diagonalizing the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) , we use fidelity susceptibility to show the quantum transition of the ground state predicted by the semiclassical hamiltonian ( [ ch ] ) . the ground state fidelity susceptibility is defined as @xmath30},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 [ @xmath32 is the ground ( excited ) state of @xmath33 , @xmath34 and [ @xmath35 is the corresponding ground ( excited ) energy . here",
    "we suppose that @xmath33 has a non - degenerate ground state . in our system , @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "when @xmath37 , the ground states are degenerate for some values of @xmath18 . to break this degeneracy ,",
    "we add an non - zero tilt and then we can use fidelity susceptibility to study the quantum transition of the ground state .     for @xmath38 under tilt @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "one can see a clear transition from double peaks to single peak around @xmath42 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ chiv0 ] , we fix the particle number @xmath3 to show the relation between @xmath43 and @xmath25 . we find that under a small @xmath25 , @xmath43 has two peaks . with the increase of @xmath25 , the position of the left peak",
    "does not change but the right peak moves left towards smaller @xmath18 .",
    "when @xmath25 is moderate ( for example when @xmath44 ) , only one peak remains and continues moving left .",
    "when @xmath25 is large enough ( for example when @xmath45 ) , no peak remains .",
    "the behavior of @xmath43 can be understood from the analysis of the ground state .",
    "the ground state can be expanded as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 . through studying the spectrum @xmath49 as a function of @xmath50",
    ", we can know the configuration of particles in the two wells .",
    "[ ck ] shows the spectra under different tilts @xmath39 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 . under @xmath39 [ fig .",
    "[ ck](a ) ] , when @xmath51 , @xmath49 is symmetric and has a peak at @xmath52 , which is consistent with the knowledge that the ground state is a binomial state @xmath53 at @xmath54 under @xmath55 .",
    "when @xmath56 , @xmath49 is still symmetric but has two peaks .",
    "this means the ground state becomes a cat - like state . when @xmath57 , @xmath49 only has one peak which moves towards @xmath58 , meaning all particles tend to locate in one well and self - trapping occurs .",
    "therefore , at small enough tilt , there are three phases , reflected by two peaks of fidelity susceptibility .",
    "if we increase the tilt , the cat - like region becomes smaller and finally vanishes after the tilt is increased to an appropriate value , for example @xmath59 in fig .",
    "[ ck](b ) . at this value of the tilt",
    ", the ground state will change from the binomial configuration to the self - trapping directly at some critical @xmath18 , reflected by the single peak of @xmath43 .",
    "for a very large tilt , @xmath49 is not symmetric in the whole region [ fig .",
    "[ ck](c ) ] and no ground state transition appears .",
    "so far our discussion is based on a fixed particle number @xmath3 .",
    "now we need to fix the tilt and enlarge @xmath3 to see what happens in the large-@xmath3 limit .",
    "the height of peaks in both double - peak and single - peak region diverge with @xmath3 exponentially as predicted by the fidelity susceptibility theory [ fig .",
    "[ chin](c ) ] . in the double - peak region",
    "[ chin](a ) ] , when we increase @xmath3 , the distance between the two peaks becomes smaller .",
    "a finite - size analysis of the positions @xmath60 of both peaks shows that @xmath61 with @xmath62 for the left peak and @xmath63 for the right peak .",
    "therefore , @xmath60 of both peaks will tend to 2 when @xmath64 , being consistent with the prediction of eq .",
    "( [ ch ] ) .",
    "similarly , in the single - peak region [ fig .",
    "[ chin](b ) ] , @xmath65 is also proportional to @xmath66 with @xmath67",
    ". we can know from these results that in the thermodynamic limit there is only one direct _ quantum phase transition _ from the binomial state to the self - trapping state .",
    "the double - transition from the binomial state to the cat state then to the self - trapping state under a small tilt and for moderate @xmath3 is actually a _",
    "crossover_. our results confirm that the fidelity susceptibility is useful for detecting not only quantum phase transitions but also crossovers @xcite .",
    "it is usually stated that the quantum transition of the ground state can be indicated by some quantum information quantity , such as entanglement of the ground state . here",
    "we revisit this problem by studying the correlation in the transition region of our system .",
    "before we discuss this , we first introduce two quantities we use to describe the correlation : the total correlation and quantum discord .",
    "suppose that we have a system @xmath68 composed by two subsystems @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "then we can use three density matrices @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 to describe the states of the whole system and the two subsystems respectively , where @xmath74 .",
    "the joint entropy of the whole system is defined as the von neumann entropy of @xmath71 : @xmath75 .",
    "similarly , we can also calculate the von neumann entropy @xmath76 of @xmath77 .",
    "if @xmath71 is a pure state , @xmath78 is called as entanglement entropy and used to quantify the quantum entanglement between @xmath69 and @xmath70 . however ,",
    "if @xmath71 is a mixed state ( like the two - body reduced density matrix in our system ) , @xmath76 is not a good measure of entanglement . the total correlation ( the quantum mutual information ) between @xmath69 and @xmath70 is given by @xmath79 , where @xmath80 . generally speaking , a bipartite quantum state @xmath71 has both classical and quantum characteristics .",
    "so we can divide the the total correlation @xmath81 into two parts : the quantum part and the classical part .",
    "the classical part is defined as the maximum information about one subsystem that can be obtained by performing measurements on the other subsystem .",
    "let us consider a measurement performed only on subsystem @xmath70 .",
    "this measurement can be described by a complete set of projectors @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the state of system @xmath68 after the application of @xmath85 becomes @xmath86 with @xmath87 $ ] . according to the definition",
    ", the classical correlation can be obtained as @xmath88 , where @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the quantum component of the correlation between two systems can be regarded as the difference between the total correlation and the classical correlation .",
    "this quantity is what we call quantum discord @xmath91 .",
    "it is interesting that some non - entangled states can also have nonzero quantum discord @xcite , revealing that quantum discord is more suitable to capture the quantumness of correlation than entanglement . for pure states ,",
    "the discord reduces exactly to the entanglement entropy .",
    "now we consider quantum discord and the total correlation between two particles in our double - well system ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the discussion of the entanglement between identical particles ) . because all particles are identical qubits , we have @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the von neumann entropy of one- ( two- ) particle reduced density matrix . here",
    "the one - particle and two - particle reduced density matrices are defined as @xmath94 and @xmath95 respectively , where @xmath96 and the average is made under the ground state .",
    "for qubits , each complete set of projectors contains two elements labeled by two parameters @xmath97 $ ] and @xmath98 $ ] , such that @xmath99 one can note that actually we can write @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) with @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "then the quantum discord can be expressed as @xmath104,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 $ ] and @xmath106 .",
    "although in some cases one can obtain an analytical expression for @xmath107 @xcite , we have to do a numerical calculation here .",
    "we divide the domains of @xmath108 ( @xmath109 $ ] ) and @xmath24 ( @xmath110 $ ] ) into 100 equal intervals respectively and search the minimization .     and total correlation @xmath81 for @xmath38 under different tilts @xmath111 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "one can see that with the increase of @xmath25 , both @xmath107 and @xmath81 decrease . ]",
    "similar with what we did in sec .",
    "[ fs ] , we first fix the particle number @xmath3 to study the relation between correlations and @xmath25 ( fig . [ dv0 ] ) .",
    "we find that @xmath107 and @xmath81 have similar behaviors . under a small tilt @xmath111 ,",
    "each correlation in the transition region is remarkably larger than that out of the transition region , which means this transition can not be described by the mean field theory for this system size . however , for each correlation we only observe one peak , whose position is near the position of the right peak of @xmath43 [ fig .",
    "[ chin](a ) ] .",
    "if we increase the tilt to @xmath112 , both @xmath107 and @xmath81 become smaller .",
    "however , a peak still exists , whose position is near the position of the single peak of @xmath43 [ fig .",
    "[ chin](b ) ] .",
    "if the tilt is further increased , both @xmath107 and @xmath81 are almost zero , meaning the ground state is almost a product state for any @xmath18 .",
    "then , we want to know whether we can have a non - zero correlation in the large-@xmath3 limit . after fixing @xmath25",
    ", we find both @xmath107 and @xmath81 decrease with @xmath3 [ fig .",
    "[ staticd](a ) and ( b ) ] . through a finite - size analysis for the tilt @xmath111 , we find the peak values of the correlations decay exponentially as @xmath113 ( @xmath114 for quantum discord and @xmath115 for the total correlation ) .",
    "this means in the @xmath116 limit , there will not be correlation in the transition region and this transition can be described by the mean field theory . for @xmath112",
    ", a similar conclusion can also be obtained .",
    "in this paper , we analyze the quantum transition of the ground state for the single level bose - hubbard model in a double - well system with an arbitrary tilt .",
    "a semiclassical hamiltonian predicts that for a not too large tilt , this transition happens at @xmath117 .",
    "we use fidelity susceptibility @xmath43 to identify this transition .",
    "we find that for a small tilt , @xmath43 has two peaks which are at the same position in the @xmath64 limit .",
    "one peak corresponds to the transition from a binomial state to a cat - like state and the other peak corresponds to the transition from a cat - like state to the self - trapping state .",
    "while for a moderate tilt , only one peak of @xmath43 is observed , which corresponds to the direct transition from a binomial state to self - trapping . for a large tilt , no transition is observed in @xmath43 .",
    "we also use two quantities describing correlation , quantum discord and the total correlation , to indicate the ground state transition . for a finite system size",
    ", each correlation has a peak in the transition region ( either for a small tilt or a moderate tilt ) , meaning the transition can not be described by the mean field theory .",
    "however , by doing a finite - size analysis , we find that in the @xmath64 limit , both correlations decay exponentially with particle number to zero .",
    "it is an interesting generalization to check the behavior of quantum correlation with system size in other systems where a ground state transition that can not be described by the mean - field theory exists , such as rotating bec .",
