    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) continues to be a remarkable resource for studies of galactic structure and the local group . in addition to the large scale features attributed to past galaxy accretion events @xcite ,",
    "sdss data was used to detect the remarkably strong tidal tails of palomar 5 @xcite .",
    "most recently , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite used sdss data to discover several new dwarf satellites of the milky way .",
    "substantial tidal streams have now been found associated with at least two of the eight globular clusters in the sdss area ; pal 5 @xcite and ngc 5466 @xcite .",
    "most recently , @xcite discovered a @xmath2 cold stellar stream without an obvious progenitor .",
    "though the parent body may be one of the @xmath3 globular clusters situated outside the sdss area , it is equally possible that the stream is all that remains of a globular cluster that was disrupted long ago .    in this paper",
    "we analyze a broad , @xmath0 long stream , independently detected in sdss data by @xcite .",
    "we briefly describe our analysis in section [ analysis ] .",
    "we discuss the detection of the stellar stream in section [ discussion ] , make some initial distance estimates in section [ distance ] , and attempt to identify a progenitor in section [ progenitor ] .",
    "we make concluding remarks in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "data comprising @xmath4 photometry for @xmath5 stars in the region @xmath6 and @xmath7 were extracted from the sdss database using the sdss casjobs query system .",
    "the data were analyzed using the matched filter technique employed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and described in detail by @xcite .",
    "this technique is made necessary by the fact that , over the magnitude range and over the region of sky we are considering , the foreground disk stars outnumber the more distant stars in the galactic halo by three orders of magnitude .",
    "applied in the color - magnitude domain , the matched filter is a means by which we can optimally differentiate between two populations , provided we know the color - magnitude distribution of each .",
    "we used the sdss photometry to create a color - magnitude density or hess diagram for both stars of interest and for the contaminating foreground population . dividing the former by the latter",
    ", we generated an array of relative weights which constitutes an optimal color - magnitude filter . using this filter , every star in the survey",
    "can be assigned a weight or probability of association with a particular color - magnitude sequence .",
    "having used observed data to generate it , the filter implicitly includes the effects of photometric uncertainties .    to generate the filters",
    ", we used the sdss - observed color magnitude distributions for stars in each of the eight globular clusters in the sdss dr4 area ( ngc 2419 , pal 3 , ngc 5272 , ngc 5466 , pal 5 , ngc 6205 , ngc 7078 , and ngc 7089 ) . a single hess diagram for field stars",
    "was generated using @xmath8 stars spread over @xmath9 deg@xmath10 of dr4 .",
    "we applied each of the eight optimal filters in turn to the entire survey area , and the weighted star counts were summed by location on the sky to produce two dimensional probability maps .",
    "we used all stars with @xmath11 .",
    "we dereddended the sdss photometry as a function of position on the sky using the dirbe / iras dust maps of @xcite .",
    "we optimally filtered the @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 star counts independently and then co - added the resulting weight images . in figure 1",
    "we show the final , combined , filtered star count distribution , using a filter matched to the color magnitude distribution of stars in m 13 .",
    "the image has been smoothed with a gaussian kernel with @xmath16 . a low - order",
    ", polynomial surface has been subtracted from the image to approximately remove large scale gradients due to the galactic disk and bulge .",
    "quite obvious in figure 1 are two broad streams , one running east to west across the center of the field , and the other running more nearly north and south .",
    "the stronger , east - west stream is part of the well known northern tidal tail of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy @xcite .",
    "the north - south stream is clearly distinct from the sagittarius stream ( intersecting at an angle of almost @xmath17 on the sky ) , and runs from ( r.a . ,",
    "decl ) = ( @xmath18 ) to approximately ( r.a . ,",
    "decl . ) = ( @xmath19 ) . on the sky",
    ", the stream runs in a @xmath0 , nearly great circle path from ursa major in the north to sextans in the south .",
    "the stream is distinct from the low latitude halo stream found by yanny et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , which lies some @xmath20 to the east of the present stream .",
    "the stream is also visible in figure 1 of @xcite .",
    "the stream was found using a filter that is matched to the color magnitude distribution and luminosity function of stars in the globular cluster m 13 , though shifted faintwards by 2.1 magnitudes .",
    "we used m 13 s color - magnitude locus primarily because , owing to 13 s relative proximity , we have a better measure of its luminosity function and the effects of sdss completeness .",
    "the stream is not a product of our dereddening procedure .",
    "figure 2 shows the portion of the reddening map of @xcite covering the region of interest .",
    "there appears to be no correlation between the new stream and the applied reddening corrections .",
    "the maximum values of @xmath21 are @xmath22 , with typical values of 0.03 in the southern region of the stream and 0.01 in the northern .",
    "there are diminutions here and there in the stream that could perhaps be attributed to regions of higher reddening in figure 2 , but there is certainly no long trough in the reddening map that could be held to account for the entire stream .",
    "we have also run our optimum filter against the sdss dr4 galaxy catalog to investigate whether the stream could be due to confusion with faint galaxies .",
    "though there are occassional concentrations of galaxies along the stream s trajectory , there is no indication of a continuous north - south feature as is apparent in figure 1 .",
    "we conclude that faint galaxies also can not be held to account for the stream .    at its southern end",
    "the stream is truncated by the limits of the available data .",
    "the apparent surface density of the stream is highest at this point , and we are fairly confident that larger surveys will be able to extend the current stream substantially to the south . on the northern end ,",
    "the stream becomes indiscernible beyond @xmath23 .",
    "we have attempted to trace the stream in the portion of the sdss extending from @xmath24 by shifting the filter to both brighter and fainter magnitudes , but to no avail .",
    "we conclude that we are seeing either @xmath25 a substantial local drop in volume density at the northern end of the stream ( due perhaps to an episodic stripping process or a higher velocity portion of an eccentric orbit ) , @xmath26 a significant change in the color - magnitude distribution of stars along the stream , or @xmath27 the physical end of the stream .",
    "we consider the second option to be the least likely of the three possibilities , though it is not inconceivable that distinct stellar populations could have been pulled from the progenitor in sequence .",
    "arguments for or against @xmath28 and ( @xmath29 will have to await the acquisition of survey data covering a larger field .    sampling by eye at several representative points , the stream appears to be about @xmath1 wide on average .",
    "this is significantly broader than the globular cluster streams found by @xcite and @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is similar to the western portion of the sagittarius stream visible in figure 1 .",
    "@xmath1 corresponds to about 700 pc at our estimated distance to the stream ( see below ) .",
    "if the stream is circular in cross section , then in a logarithmic potential with @xmath30 km s@xmath31 , a radial width of this magnitude would correspond to @xmath32 km s@xmath31 .",
    "this is considerably larger than the expected random velocities of stars weakly stripped from globular clusters and implies a much larger progenitor mass . of course",
    ", with the stream passing high over the outer regions of the disk ( @xmath33 ) we can not currently say how broad the stream is along a radial from the galactic center .",
    "however , 700 pc remains much larger than the tidal diameters of globular clusters , and we conclude that the progenitor is most likely to be an extant or disrupted dwarf galaxy .    integrating the background subtracted , weighted star counts along the stream over a width of @xmath34 we find that the total number of stars in the discernible stream down to @xmath35 is @xmath36 .",
    "the surface density of stars in the southern portion of the stream ( @xmath37 ) is roughly twice that of the northernmost section ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the highest surface densities along the southern portion of the stream are @xmath39 stars deg@xmath40 .",
    "the power of the matched filter resides primarily at the main sequence turn - off and below , where the stellar luminosity function increases rapidly and the bulk of the foreground contaminants lie well to the red .",
    "if our filter is globally matching the color - magnitude distribution of the stream population , then we can use the filter response to estimate distances by main sequence fitting ( e.g. @xcite ) . in figure 3",
    "we show the color - magnitude distribution for the stream stars , extracted by generating a hess diagram of stars in a 11 deg.@xmath10 area covering the southern portion of the stream , and subtracting a similar field star distribution sampled over 28 deg@xmath10 to the east and west of the stream . a clear signature of the sub - giant branch and the main sequence turn - off is evident in the stream population . moreover , the sub - giant and turn - off region of the distribution match the dereddened , shifted @xmath41 rgb / main sequence locus of m 13 very well .",
    "varying the magnitude shift applied to m 13 s main sequence locus from 1.5 to 3.0 mags , we measured the foreground - subtracted , mean surface density of stream stars in the regions @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 . to avoid potential problems related to a difference in age between m 13 and the stream stars",
    ", we used only the portion of the filter with @xmath45 , where the bright cutoff is 0.8 magnitudes below m 13 s main sequence turn - off .",
    "this reduces the stream contrast significantly , but still provides sufficient signal to identify the optimum magnitude shift .",
    "fitting gaussians to the mean surface densities as a function of magnitude shift ( e.g. @xcite , we find the highest contrasts occur for shifts of 2.1 , 2.4 , and @xmath46 mags for the three stream segments identified above .",
    "this puts the stream roughly perpendicular to our line of sight at an average distance 2.78 times that of m 13 . adopting a distance to m 13 of 7.7 kpc , we arrive at a mean sun - stream distance of @xmath47 kpc , where the uncertainty reflects only random measurement errors .",
    "the measurement of relative distances in this manner rests on the assumption that the color - magnitude distribution of stream stars is uniform , and that different parts of the stream will respond to magnitude shifts in the filter in the same way . of course",
    ", this may not be true if different sub - populations of the parent galaxy were removed at different times .",
    "our relative distance estimates may also be subject to variations in sdss sensitivity and completeness at faint magnitudes , though over the scales with which we are dealing , it seems reasonable to suppose that the such variations will have largely averaged out .",
    "the stream does not pass near any of the known dwarf galaxies in the local group . while leo i and leo a lie close to the stream in projection , their respective distances of @xmath48 kpc @xcite and @xmath49 kpc",
    "@xcite put them well beyond the 21 kpc distance we determined above .",
    "the sextans dwarf is situated about @xmath50 west of the southern end of the stream . however , at its distance of @xmath51 kpc @xcite it too is too far away to be a likely progenitor . at this distance",
    "its main sequence turn - off would be well below the completeness limit of the sdss data , which is clearly inconsistent with figure 3 .",
    "though we are obviously limited by the lack of velocity information , for a given model of the galactic potential the progenitor s orbit is actually fairly well constrained by the observed distance and orientation of the stream . using the model of @xcite ( which includes a disk , bulge , and spherical halo , and which @xcite and @xcite found to work reasonably well for ngc 5466 and pal 5 )",
    ", we use a least squares method to fit both the orientation on the sky and the distance measurements in section [ distance ] .",
    "in addition to a number of normal points lying along the centerline of the stream , we chose as a velocity fiducial point a position at the northern tip of the stream at ( r.a .",
    ", decl ) = ( 141.2 , 51.2 ) .    if we allow the proper motions to be free ranging and uninteresting parameters , we find that the 95% confidence interval in @xmath52 predicts @xmath53 km s@xmath31 at the fiducial point .",
    "the corresponding ranges in perigalactic and apogalactic radii are @xmath54 kpc and @xmath55 kpc . of course",
    ", these ranges do not take into account uncertainties in the absolute distance of the stream ( which depends on the uncertainty in m 13 s distance ) or in the validity of @xcite s galactic model .",
    "however , they do suggest a fairly compact orbit with moderate eccentricity .",
    "integrating orbits for parameter sets spanning the range above , we find that there are another five known dwarf galaxies ( ngc 185 , the aquarius dwarf galaxy , ngc 6822 , and the sagittarius irregular and dwarf elliptical galaxies ) that lie within @xmath56 of the projected orbits . however , with the exception of the sagittarius de , their measured distances are all greater than 500 kpc and would therefor require rather unreasonably high orbital eccentricities ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "we attribute the proximity of the sagittarius de to the new stream s projected orbit to the expected confluence of orbit projections in the direction of the galactic center , and not to any physical association between them .    in the upper right - hand corner of figure 1 ( r.a . , decl . )",
    "= ( @xmath58 ) is a fairly pronounced concentration of stars about 37 kpc distant which we identify as a new globular cluster or dwarf galaxy @xcite .",
    "the object lies within @xmath59 of the projected orbit of the stream ( 1.8 kpc at the distance of the stream ) . however , its diminutive size and its 16 kpc separation from the stream s orbit argue against its being either the progenitor or a part of the debris in the stream .",
    "applying optimal contrast filtering techniques to sdss data , we have detected a broad stream of stars some @xmath0 long on the sky .",
    "we are at present unable to identify a progenitor for this stream , though from its appearance and location on the sky , we believe it to be a either an extant or disrupted dwarf galaxy .",
    "the color - magnitude distribution of stars in the stream closely matches that of the globular cluster m 13 , indicating that the stars making up the stream are old and metal poor .",
    "the stream appears to be about 21 kpc distant , and the portion of the stream contained in the survey data is roughly perpendicular to our line of sight .",
    "refinement of the stream s orbit will require radial velocity measurements of individual stars along its length .",
    "ultimately , the vetted stream stars will become prime targets for the space interferometry mission , whose proper motion measurements will enable very much stronger constraints to be placed on both the orbit of the progenitor and on the potential field of the galaxy .",
    "funding for the creation and distribution of the sdss archive has been provided by the alfred p. sloan foundation , the participating institutions , the national aeronautics and space administration , the national science foundation , the u.s .",
    "department of energy , the japanese monbukagakusho , and the max planck society ."
