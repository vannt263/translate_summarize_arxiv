    "in hadronic collisions soft interactions are dominant . these are characterized by large distances ( @xmath1 ) and",
    "the pqcd can not be used for their study .",
    "regge - pole theory is the main method for description of high - energy soft processes and the pomeron is the main object of this approach , which is associated with cylinder - type diagrams of @xmath2 expansion in qcd .",
    "@xmath2 expansion is a dynamical expansion and the speed of convergence depends on the kinematical region of studying process . at very high energies many terms of the expansion ( multi - pomeron exchanges ) should be taken into account .",
    "the models of quark - gluon strings ( qgsm ) @xcite and dual - parton model ( dpm ) @xcite , are based on nonperturbative notions , combining @xmath2 expansion in qcd with regge theory and using parton structure of hadrons . here",
    "we concentrate on qgsm , which has been successfully applied to many different problems of strong interactions : hadronic mass spectrum @xcite , widths of resonances @xcite , relations between the total cross - sections , residues of regge poles @xcite , behavior of hadronic form factors @xcite , baryon number transfer @xcite , and multiparticle production at high energies @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we briefly describe qgsm , compare its predictions with s@xmath0s and tevatron data on charged particles pseudorapidity and multiplicity distributions and give predictions for lhc .",
    "in qgsm the production of a particle is defined through production of showers and each shower corresponds to the cut - pomeron pole contribution in the elastic scattering amplitude . for hadron - hadron collisions",

    "the sum of @xmath16 ( @xmath3 = 1,2,3 , @xmath17 ) defines the cross - section of non - diffractive interaction .",
    "the association of the pomeron with cylinder - type diagrams leads to the fact that in a single cut - pomeron diagram there are two chains of particles ( strings ) .",
    "analogously , in case of @xmath3 cut - pomerons there are 2@xmath3 chains .",
    "inclusive distribution in rapidities and multiplicity distribution of particles for non - diffractive events can be expressed in terms of rapidity distributions , @xmath18 , and multiplicity distribution , @xmath19 , for 2@xmath3-chains @xcite : @xmath20 in order to calculate the distribution of hadrons produced during the fragmentation of the strings one should take into account that the hadron can be produced in each of the 2@xmath3-chains and the ( di-)quarks , which stretch the strings , carry only a fraction of energy of the incoming protons . in these terms , the inclusive spectra can be written as convolutions of the probabilities to find a string with certain rapidity length and the fragmentation functions , which defines the distribution of hadrons in the string breaking process .",

    "in fact these are the only free parameters in the model that are fixed from fit to data . in articles @xcite,@xcite and @xcite the following values",

    "the structure and fragmentation functions are determined by the corresponding regge asymptotic behaviors in the regions @xmath36 and @xmath37 and for the full range of @xmath24 an interpolation is done .",

    "@xcite .    in hadronic interactions",
    "diffractive processes play an important role .",
    "densities of produced particles in these processes are small , especially in the central rapidity region , but their cross - section is not negligible with respect to non - diffractive cross - section and they must be taken into account in calculations of characteristics of secondary particles . in ref .",
    "@xcite single- and double- diffractive processes are described in terms of dressed triple - reggeon and loop diagrams .",
    "for instance , for calculating the rapidity distribution of particles produced in soft single - diffractive events the first equation in ( [ eq : eq2 ] ) must be replaced by ( see @xcite ) : @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the derivative of single - diffraction dissociation cross - section , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the mass of the diffracted system .",
    "the model does not contain `` odderon''-type singularities with negative signature , which could lead to a difference of @xmath12 and @xmath0 scattering , so at energies @xmath48 100 gev all characteristics of @xmath12 and @xmath0 interactions coincide .",
    "qgsm has been used successfully to describe data on secondary hadron inclusive cross - sections integrated over transverse momentum , such as rapidity and multiplicity distributions , ratios of particles and it explains many characteristic features of hadron - hadron soft interactions . but for calculating pseudorapidity distribution from eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq2 ] ) or ( [ eq : eq4 ] ) we must know mean transverse momentum of particles .",
    "though the model does not give predictions on @xmath49 dependence , some conclusions can be obtained from its basics ( or from gribov s reggeon calculus in general ) .",
    "as it is already mentioned , the multi - particle production is described in terms of cut - pomeron diagrams . on the other hand , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq1 ] ) it is easy to see that the mean number of cut - pomerons increases with energy @xmath50 .",
    "average transverse momenta of produced particles increase with the number of chains : @xmath51 .",
    "so , we expect at lhc energies to have mean transverse momentum of produced particles higher then the one measured at isr energies . analogously , the selection of events with high multiplicity results in an increase of cut - pomerons number and to an increase of @xmath52 .",
    "this dependence is observed experimentally by ua1 and cdf collaborations ( @xcite and @xcite ) . only in cases of @xcite the values of measurements",
    "are published and in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] we compare our expected dependence with these data .",
    "the fit result is : @xmath53    [ fig : fig1 ]    in order to convert rapidity to pseudorapidity distributions we used experimentally measured @xmath54 for different types of particles ( here we assume that the sample of secondary charged particles consists from @xmath55 , @xmath56 and protons , and their anti - particles ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have parameterized @xmath54 as a function of @xmath57 for charged pions , kaons and anti - protons , and found a successful fit to the data from isr to tevatron energies with the second - order polynomial function of @xmath58 .",
    "fit result is @xcite : @xmath59 in the following for each energy and for each particle type we calculate @xmath60 using ( [ eq : eq6 ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] we give description of s@xmath0s and tevatron data on charged particles pseudorapidity distributions in @xmath0 non - single diffractive ( nsd ) events and give a prediction for @xmath57 = 14 tev .",

    "theory with account of `` non - enhanced '' diagrams ( without interaction between pomerons ) , which we consider now , inclusive cross - sections @xmath62 at very high energies and at @xmath63 increase with energy as @xmath64 ( see the first article in ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "this means , in particular , that an energy dependence of inclusive spectra in the central rapidity region gives more reliable information on the value of @xmath14 , than an energy dependence of @xmath65 , where pomeron cuts strongly modify energy dependence compared to the pole diagram .",
    "an integral over rapidity density gives charged particles mean multiplicity @xmath66 . in tables",
    "[ tab : tab1 ]  and  [ tab : tab2 ] we list qgsm predictions on pseudorapidity density at mid - rapidity and mean number of charged particles for @xmath12 interactions at various energies of lhc . charged particles mean multiplicity is calculated for @xmath67 and @xmath68 pseudorapidity bins , corresponding to alice @xcite and atlas / cms @xcite detectors central barrel acceptances , respectively , and for full phase - space .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the multiplicity distribution in the model is given according to eq  ( [ eq : eq2 ] ) by a sum of @xmath3 cut - pomerons contributions and it is assumed poisson - like form for each contributor . in this scheme ,",
    "the kno scaling @xcite is approximately valid up to isr energies ( @xmath69 100 gev , where the poissonian distributions for a different number @xmath3 of cut - pomerons significantly overlap ) and must be definitely violated at higher energies @xcite , as confirmed by measurements done at s@xmath0s and tevatron . in fig .",

    "[ fig : fig5 ] predictions for @xmath57 = 14 tev for the full phase - space and for two preudorapidity bins ( corresponding to alice and atlas / cms detectors central barrel acceptances ) are given .",
    "in this formulation , the model at very high energies ( starting from @xmath70 10 tev ) predicts @xmath71 asymptotic behavior for particles rapidity density at mid - rapidity and @xmath72 for mean number of secondary particles in the full phase - space .",
    "we stress that the contribution of enhanced diagrams ( the interaction between pomerons ) that we do not take into account here are expected to be essential at these energies . with the account of these diagrams @xmath73 and @xmath74 asymptotic behaviors are expected .",

    "[ fig : fig6 ] we give a description of ua5 data @xcite on charged particles pseudorapidity distribution in single diffractive events at @xmath57 = 900 gev ( dissociation of one of the colliding particles is considered ) and give a prediction for @xmath57=14 tev . for both energies",
    "the spectra are calculated by integrating over all masses of the diffractive system ( up to @xmath75 0.05 ) .",
