    "recently there has been considerable interest in experimenting with gravity using quantum instrument  @xcite , to better explore its theory , predictions , and applications in uncontested regimes  @xcite .",
    "this trend has been established through laboratory measurements of the gravitational acceleration by ultra cold atom interferometers with accuracies exceeding that achievable by conventional gravimeters  @xcite .",
    "the realization of such quantum gravity and gravity gradient sensors as portable devices would herald a new level of quantum applications in engineering and technology  @xcite .    for physicists",
    ", it has been hoped that major progress across a range of areas could be enabled by the availability of precision quantum gravity sensors .",
    "these include testing of the equivalence principle as a foundation of general relativity in the quantum domain  @xcite , confronting macroscopic quantum behaviour with a microgravity environment  @xcite , and assessing a long range effect such as gravitational time dilation on quantum coherence  @xcite .",
    "above all , quantum experiments may promise fundamental breakthroughs by offering a unique opportunity of accessing phenomena from quantum gravity and planck scale physics that would otherwise have required an inconceivable @xmath2 gev gut - scale particle collider  @xcite .",
    "there are a number of counterintuitive effects unavailable in the classical domain to justify novelties and advantages of quantum measurements . for bell s",
    "inequality related experiments  @xcite , quantum entanglement and nonlocality are the key .",
    "more relevant to precision measurements , in the case of atom interferometry metrology , the short matter wavelength underpins a fine scale resolution .",
    "when atom interferometry is applied to gravity measurements including gradiometry and spacetime fluctuations , the slowness of the motion for cold atoms contributes to a longer interaction time to build up effects in terms of phase shift due to acceleration and decoherence due to granulation respectively  @xcite . for quantum systems with a large number of correlated particles",
    ", nontrivial collective behaviours can arise  @xcite .",
    "an early remarkable example shows up in the hanbury brown and twiss s intensity interferometry  @xcite .",
    "collective behaviours can give rise to significant amplifications of quantum effects associated with a large number of correlated particles , as exemplified in dicke s seminal superradiance  @xcite . in this paper , we will analyze previously unexploited collective quantum interactions between a large number of particles with gravitational waves that may be relevant for their detections beyond the existing observation windows e.g. in the frequency domain of fundamental , astronomical and cosmological interest  @xcite .    in particular , we consider stochastic gravitational waves of higher frequencies than the existing detection range , that may have a primordial origin and carry imprints of post - inflation structure formation processes  @xcite . the nature and possible observation of such stochastic gravitational waves",
    "have attracted significant recent attention since the ground breaking detection of gravitational waves by ligo and virgo collaborations  @xcite with anticipation of broader gravitational wave astronomy and cosmology  @xcite . in what follows ,",
    "we present a generic theoretical analysis without assuming a specific distribution function @xmath3 and the equivalent spectral function @xmath4 for gravitational waves apart from being gaussian , which is physically reasonable  @xcite , and the type of atoms apart from being bosonic so as to have large occupation number states and the resulting collective dynamics .    for possible future implementation considerations",
    ", we have in mind rydberg atoms  @xcite , in view of a number of exceptional physical characteristics they possess : ( i ) their large principal quantum number @xmath5 means that the effective mass quadrupole moment , which provides external gravitational wave coupling and scales with @xmath6 , can be greatly enhanced .",
    "( ii ) these atoms are very stable having extremely long life times of the internal transitions up to the order of one second allowing us to neglect them in many practical situations  @xcite .",
    "( iii ) by placing rydberg atoms in a high-@xmath7 cavity with controlled boundary conditions , undesirable transitions may be further suppressed  @xcite .",
    "the presence of the cavity may also change the quantum electrodynamics of the atom to modify the interaction between the nucleus and the electron so as to increase the quadrupole interaction while suppressing the atom - atom dipole interaction as well  @xcite .",
    "( iv ) increasingly large numbers of rydberg atoms with high principal quantum numbers @xmath8 have been produced in laboratories  @xcite . by virtue of these properties",
    ", we will hypothesize for simplicity a setup of @xmath0 identical free 2-level rydberg atoms with a quadrupole moment transition frequency @xmath9 used to evaluate the distribution function @xmath3 and the equivalent spectral function @xmath4 for the stochastic gravitational waves .",
    "further refinement is possible to reduce the present level of idealization but will be deferred to future work .",
    "the investigations of rydberg atoms as a many - body system have often featured in the recent literature  @xcite with their collective quantum dynamics receiving current research interest both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "the effect of that curved metric have on hydrogen - like rydberg systems have been considered in a number of works  @xcite , in which the calculations show a shift in the energy spectrum . gravity as been proposed to induce decoherence in atomic states  @xcite , making the analysis of the evolution of the atomic state a potential method for the detection of gravitational fluctuation  @xcite .",
    "however , these effects have also been found to be generally too small to be measured in practice .    here , rather than considering the gravitational interactions for individual systems",
    ", we investigate the coherent quantum interactions for a large number of correlated atoms with gravitational waves .",
    "we find that the resulting collective interactions can lead to amplified transition rate of states with a quadrupole moment in a fashion akin to superradiance  @xcite .",
    "this collective amplification therefore adds to the application of rydberg atoms , which are already more sensitive to spacetime perturbations @xcite , as a basis for a possible future detection scheme for gravitational waves of a wider spectral window , especially towards higher frequencies than currently accessible , which may be of fundamental and cosmological importance .",
