    "in order to put the li abundance of our sample in the context of the known results for solar - like stars , we used the work of @xcite as a reference , as it is , to date , the largest homogeneous compilation of lithium abundance of ms and subgiants stars .",
    "they derived stellar parameters and li abundances for 671 stars and included measurements from the literature to construct a catalog of 1381 fgk dwarf and subgiant stars . analyzing the distribution of data in the a(li)@xmath1 plane , they confirmed that , in the interval @xmath12  k , stars appear to be neatly separated into two groups of high and low li abundance , creating an avoidance region , called _ lithium desert _ , as was suggested for the first time by @xcite .",
    "these authors proposed that the low - li side of the a(li)@xmath1 diagram is populated by evolved lithium dip objects @xcite , that might burn the li during the pre - ms stage .",
    "however , @xcite argues against this suggestion , based on their analyisis of the mass - metallicity correlation ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "* ) of their whole sample , which includes the @xcite data .",
    "they also show that there are no young stars ( age@xmath132  gyr ) at the lower side of the _ lithium desert _ , suggesting that the mechanism that depletes surface lithium in the objects that populate that region should take place during the ms or subgiant phases .",
    "however , @xcite do not further speculate on the nature of this mechanism .",
    "in total , we have 11 stars in common with @xcite ; however , for the star hd  140385 we have only upper limits and was excluded from the comparison . in fig .",

    ", this object should have half the ew measured in our work , which would represent a 4.5@xmath14 anomaly .",
    "since , the ew measurement for this star is one of our best determinations , and the stellar parameters used in both works are not so different , we do not have a clear cause for the discrepancy . in the following analysis",
    ", we exclude this star too . in general",
    ", we found a good agreement between the a(li ) determined in this work and those determined in @xcite : on average , we found a difference of + 0.05  dex ( our minus @xcite data ) .",

    "if we consider our possible small overestimation of the a(li ) with respect to the @xcite scale , the star would move further inside the _ lithium desert_. encouraged by this finding , we additionally searched the literature for new a(li ) determinations for ms and subgiants stars from 2012 to date . in total",
