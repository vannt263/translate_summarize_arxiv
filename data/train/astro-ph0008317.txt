    "however , the constituents in this region appear to sum to a significantly greater mass , @xmath160 9 @xmath116 10@xmath118 m@xmath4 for the old stars plus @xmath101 3 @xmath116 10@xmath118 m@xmath4 for the molecular gas plus 5.5 @xmath116 10@xmath118 m@xmath4 for the starburst using either a salpeter imf or imf8 .",
    "the total exceeds the dynamical mass by at least 35% . unless there is substantial contamination of the disk outside the starburst by younger stars",
    ", these numbers suggest that the mass in the starburst may be overestimated .",
    "a further indication in the same direction is that the starburst plus remaining molecular gas in our nominal estimates account for 65% of the dynamical mass .",
    "theoretical modeling suggests that instabilities will set in and a starburst will appear once the mass of gas reaches @xmath101 20% of the total in a galaxy nucleus ( wada & habe 1992 ; bekki 1995 ) .",
    "these estimates are somewhat uncertain and may not apply strictly to the conditions in ngc  1614 .",
    "however , they fall so far below the deduced mass of new stars and residual gas to suggest that the imf in the ngc  1614 starburst is weighted toward massive stars , even compared with imf8 or a modified salpeter function . this behavior should be tested in studies of other extreme starbursts .",
    "the mechanism needed to account for the strong star formation in luminous mergers is a matter of debate .",
    "the two main competing models are : ( 1 ) cloud - cloud collisions which predict a large population of high mass stars to give rise to the high infrared luminosities ( scoville , sanders , & clemens 1986 ) ( 2 ) gravitational instability in nuclear gas disks , as favored by taniguchi & ohyama ( 1998 ) .",
    "the former model would predict a schmidt law , schmidt ( 1959 ) ] with index @xmath180 , whereas the latter model predicts indices @xmath181 as found for isolated galaxies and strong starbursts ( kennicutt 1998 ; taniguchi & ohyama 1998 ) .    from the pa@xmath1 luminosity of ngc  1614 ( corrected for extinction ) and using the relation between sfr and h@xmath1 luminosity ( kennicutt 1998 ) we measured a @xmath182 in the ring and a sfr surface density of @xmath183 , similar to , although slightly higher than , the earlier estimate by kennicutt ( 1998 ) from the fir luminosity and somewhat different parameters for the size of the emitting region ( @xmath184 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath185 that we found for ngc  1614 is of the same magnitude as that of the giant hii region 30 doradus ( kennicutt 1998 ) , and the global star formation efficiency for this galaxy approaches 100% over a gas consumption period of @xmath186 .",
    "based on the standard conversion , kennicutt ( 1998 ) derived @xmath187 .",
    "if the mass in molecular gas is only @xmath101 3 @xmath116 10@xmath118 m@xmath4 , with a conversion of co to h@xmath7 mass a factor of @xmath101 15 lower than the standard value , one would derive @xmath188 or more , as discussed by kennicutt ( 1998 ) ( with less gas , higher efficiency is needed ) .",
    "thus , our results appear to favor the cloud collision explanation for the high rate of star formation .",
    "mihos & hernquist ( 1994 ) explored via numerical simulations the merger of a large and a smaller galaxy , similar to our proposal for ngc  1614 . from their simulation they predicted that in response to the tidal perturbation of the infalling satellite , the disk galaxy develops strong spiral arms .",
    "this non - axisymmetric perturbation causes large quantities of material to be funneled into the central regions , and as a result a strong burst of star formation is triggered lasting for up to 60myr .",
    "the predicted central starburst is very compact ( @xmath189pc in radius ) and contains some 85% of the total mass in newly formed stars .",
    "hernquist & mihos ( 1995 ) carried out further simulations .",
    "they showed that the degree of central concentration of gas decreases markedly with the presence of a massive bulge .",
    "the relatively low dynamical mass in the central 620 pc of ngc  1614 indicates that it had little bulge prior to the collision , so it would be ideal for a strong central concentration of gas .",
    "hernquist & mihos ( 1995 ) state that the resolution of their calculations is inadequate to determine how the gas behaves once it has sunk into the central few hundred pc .",
    "however , from the behavior of ngc  1614 , it appears that it must be further concentrated until instability is reached in the bottom of the potential well of the galaxy , leading to the initial stages of massive star formation .",
    "as the starburst ages , supernovae begin to explode and winds develop that expand outward , compressing the remaining molecular gas surrounding the nucleus ( e.g. , tenorio - tagle & muoz - tun 1997 ; taniguchi , trentham , & shioya 1998 ) .",
    "gravitationally unstable shocked layers of interstellar gas may be produced in cloud cloud collisions and by the impact of these winds on incoming clouds .",
    "the resulting star formation appears to favor massive stars ( whitworth et al .",
    "1994 ) , possibly accounting for the suggestion of a high abundance of such stars in extreme starbursts .",
    "the evidence we find that the starburst in ngc  1614 has expanded from the nucleus to the ring of hii regions and into the surrounding molecular ring is in agreement with this picture .",
    "we have used _ hst_/nicmos and wfpc2 imaging , ground - based near infrared spectra , and information from the literature to study the luminous infrared galaxy ngc  1614 .",
    "the modest extinction to its starbursting nucleus , combined with our favorable viewing angle , make this galaxy ideal for probing the properties of its powerful starburst .",
    "we show that    star formation has propagated outward from the nucleus to a @xmath139pc radius circumnuclear ring of massive hii regions .",
    "these circumnuclear hii regions are an order of magnitude more luminous than 30 doradus , and hii regions in the spiral arms are similar in luminosity to 30 dor .",
    "these regions are probably younger versions of the luminous stellar clusters also around the nucleus and in the spiral arms .",
    "the presence of so many extremely luminous hii regions and stellar clusters is similar to the behavior of other luminous starbursts .",
    "the ring of hii regions is surrounded by molecular gas .",
    "the mass in molecular gas appears to be @xmath190 the prediction from the standard @xmath5co / h@xmath7 ratio , with an upper limit of 1/10 the standard ratio .",
    "the large levels of extinction predicted previously from the standard ratio are absent in ngc  1614 .",
    "the mass budget for the starburst is very tight , suggesting that the proportion of massive stars is larger than predicted by a salpeter imf modified to turn over near 1 m@xmath4 , or by the virtually identical imf8 found to fit the starburst in m82 ( rieke et al .",
    "1993 ) . until now",
    ", such imfs have been adequate to fit the properties of all known starbursts .    the high efficiency needed to convert the available molecular gas density into the observed density of star formation suggests that the starburst is propagating by cloud - cloud interactions and winds .",
    "the behavior of ngc  1614 is consistent with simulations for the interaction of a modest sized galaxy with a massive , late type spiral .",
    "we thank j. hinz for a helpful discussion and the anonymous referee for a thorough critique of the first version of this paper .",
