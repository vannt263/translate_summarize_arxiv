    "the hydrodynamic calculations require an estimate of the three dimensional helium density around the solute molecule , sf@xmath0 in this case . this density will be totally symmetric in the point group of the molecule , o@xmath12 in this case .",
    "this density , @xmath14 , can be expanded in terms of the spherical tensor operators : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are linear combinations of the spherical harmonics , @xmath18 s , that transform as @xmath19 in the @xmath20 point group . in particular : @xmath21 fox and ozier  @xcite have presented a general procedure for to calculate these and higher harmonics .",
    "barnett and whaley have calculated the helium density around sf@xmath0 using the diffusion monte carlo method .",
    "their paper contains figures which give the radial isotropic density , @xmath22 , and radial ` cuts ' of the density along the c@xmath23 , c@xmath24 , and c@xmath25 symmetry axes .",
    "if we assume that the density contains only the terms explicitly given in eq .",
    "[ eq : rho_expansion ] , then we can use the isotropic density and the density cuts to determine the radial coefficients @xmath26 and @xmath27 by using the equations : @xmath28 in these equations , @xmath29 represents the radial density along the c@xmath30 symmetry axis .",
    "the radial density functions where determined by digitization of the images from the paper by barnett and whaley for clusters of 69 helium atoms , the largest for which they reported the density cuts .",
    "these equations were derived by evaluation of the tensor operators ( @xmath31 ) along each of the symmetry axes and then inverting the linear system that relates the calculated density along each cut .",
    "figure  [ fig_a ] shows the radial tensor densities calculated from these density cuts .",
    "it is apparent from this figure that the density in the first solvation shell ( which is the most important for determination of the moment of inertia ) is likely not fully converged with the present truncation of the density expansion .",
    "unfortunately , we were not able to obtain the primary data from reference @xcite which would have allowed the expansion to be carried to higher order .",
    "the assumption that the helium motion is irrotational ( @xmath32 ) implies that the velocity , @xmath33 , can be written as the gradient of a scalar function , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is known as the velocity potential . in order to calculate the increased moment of inertia caused by motion of the helium",
    ", we will assume that the molecule is undergoing classical rotation with angular velocity @xmath36 around the @xmath37 axis .",
    "the equation of continuity gives the following equation : @xmath38 where the second equality comes from the assumption that the helium density remains constant in the frame rotating with angular velocity @xmath36 around the @xmath37 axis .",
    "the boundary conditions on @xmath35 are that the normal component of the fluid velocity match the normal component of velocity of any surface .",
    "the solution to eq .",
    "[ eq : hydro ] is linear in the angular velocity and thus is solved numerically for unit velocity . equating the helium kinetic energy with the rotational kinetic energy , we can define @xmath39 by : @xmath40 \\label{ekin2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first equation holds for any velocity potential .",

    "the three cartesian axes of this coordinate system is aligned with three of the s - f bonds .",
    "the range of @xmath42 was selected between 3.5 and 10 @xmath43 with between 51 and 201 radial points .",

    "reflection in each of the four planes perpendicular to the @xmath37 axis is equivalent to change in the direction of rotation , and thus leads to a change in the sign of @xmath35 . as a result , the numerical solution for @xmath35 could be restricted to the domain @xmath46 $ ] and @xmath35 selected to be zero on each of the planes @xmath47 . between 41 and 161 equally spaced angular points were used in each of the angular coordinates coordinates . since @xmath35 or its normal",

    "the inhomogeneous partial differential eq .",
    "[ eq : hydro ] was converted to a finite difference equation in the grid of points and solved by gauss - seidel iteration with successive overrelaxation  @xcite .",
    "these equations ( which involve @xmath48 and its gradient ) become singular when @xmath49 . as a result ,",
    "the density is bounded to remain above a threshold value , which was selected as @xmath50 in this work .",
    "solutions were iterated until the mean squared change in @xmath35 on the grid points was less than a fixed fraction ( @xmath51 in this work ) of the mean squared value of @xmath35 on the grid points . for the largest grid used , this required about 6000 iteration cycles with an overrelaxation parameter of 1.4 ( @xmath36 in the notation used in numerical recipes  @xcite ) .",
    "the two integral estimates for @xmath52 are found to be 171 and 168 @xmath53 respectively .",
    "this can be compared with a value of @xmath54 inferred from the observed effective rotational constant of sf@xmath0 in @xmath4he nanodroplets  @xcite .",
    "kwon and whaley  @xcite reported the ` superfluid ' densities along the same symmetry axes , as calculated using pimc and their proposed superfluid estimator .",
    "these have greatly decreased anisotropy compared to the total density .",
    "repeating the hydrodynamic calculation using these densities gave @xmath55 .",
    "this can be compared to their ` superfluid ' contribution of the moment of inertia increase of @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "these authors also claim to have calculated the hydrodynamic contribution to the rotational constant used the total density around sf@xmath0 and report @xmath57 .",
    "this value is 5.5 times smaller than the value we have calculated . based upon our extensive experience with similar hydrodynamic calculations , the modest 50% in hydrodynamic moment of inertia",
    "is inconsistent with the considerably greater angular anisotropy of the total density compared to their reported ` superfluid ' density .",
    "the hydrodynamic prediction for the enhanced moment of inertia of sf@xmath0 in helium is @xmath58 of the experimentally observed value .",
    "this can be contrasted with the results reported in @xcite , where for heavier rotors , the theory appeared to systematically overestimate the size of the increased moment of inertia .",
    "similarly , an overestimate of the hydrodynamic estimate for the increased moment of inertia was found for a model problem of a planer rotor interacting with a rigid ring of he atoms  @xcite .",
    "one explanation for the underestimate in the present case is that the density model used has underestimated the true anisotropy of the helium density , particularly in the first solvation shell where the hydrodynamic kinetic energy density is highest .",
    "this is supported by the results presented in fig 1 , where it is demonstrated that the highest order anisotropy we have retained is still of considerable size in this first shell .",
    "since the @xmath59 derivative of the density is the source term in the hydrodynamic equation , addition of higher order anisotropies is expected lead to increased hydrodynamic motion and thus an increased estimate of @xmath39 .",
    "this explanation for the limited success of the hydrodynamic model in the present case can be tested by repeating the hydrodynamic calculation using the full anisotropic helium density calculated by quantum monte carlo methods .",
    "an alternative explanation , which can not be ruled out at present , is that some fraction of the helium motion is not irrotational. the kelvin minimum energy principle  @xcite states that any ` rotational ' solution to the equation of continuity will generate higher helium kinetic energy and thus he contribution to the moment of inertia",
    ". this would include the hydrodynamics assumed by the ` two fluid ' model of kwon and whaley  @xcite .",
    "the fixed node , diffusion monte carlo calculations of lee _",
    "et al._@xcite were in excellent agreement with the experimental rotational excitation energies .",
    "this suggest that , barring cancelation of errors , that the nodal structure of the wavefunction assumed in that work ( which had the nodal properties of the rigid rotor wavefunction for the sf@xmath0 ) should be a reasonable description of the true many body wavefunction for this system .",
    "it is useful , therefore , to examine how consistent the hydrodynamic model is with the functional form assumed in that work .    in a future publication",
    ", we will present a quantum derivation of the hydrodynamic approach . in that work",
    ", it will be shown that eq .",
    "[ eq : hydro ] arises from a variational optimization of a one particle phase function that multiples the ground state wavefunction that describes the helium in the frame that rotates with the molecule .",
    "the wavefunction for the orientation of this axis system in space will be the rigid rotor function for the molecule .",
    "thus , the presence of the one particle phase functions will modify the nodal surfaces from that assumed in the lee _",
    "_ calculation .",
    "the size of the one particle phase argument will be @xmath60 .",
    "the maximum value for @xmath35 for our solution is @xmath61 , and for the @xmath62 level we can approximate @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the effective moment of inertia of sf@xmath0 in helium , @xmath65ghz .",
    "this gives a maximum hydrodynamic phase of @xmath66 , and thus it appears that this will lead of small changes in the nodal properties .",
    "we would like to point out that for the model problem of the planer rotor coupled to a ring of helium ( which can of course be solved exactly ) , the errors in the equivalent fixed node approximation was of this same size and yet the dmc estimate of the rotational excitation energy had errors of at most a few percent .",
