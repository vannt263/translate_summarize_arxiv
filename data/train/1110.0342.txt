    "with the ever - increasing precision of measurements , space has become a privileged place to test the two fundamental theories which emerged during the 20^th^ century : general relativity and quantum theory .",
    "in addition to providing a very clean environment , it opened new ways of testing these theories : as an example of interest for this article , precise navigation of interplanetary spacecrafts allows probing the scale dependence of gravitation at the solar system distance scale @xcite",
    ".    even if most experimental tests support general relativity @xcite , there are still open windows for deviations . indeed , the fact that these two fundamental theories are difficult to reconcile suggest that general relativity may not be the final description of gravitation .",
    "the reason is that gravitation is the only interaction not having a quantum description .",
    "the validity of the newton potential has been extensively tested for distances between the millimeter and the characteristic size of planetary orbits @xcite .",
    "but there remain open windows outside this distance range for violations of the inverse square law ( * ? ? ?",
    "4 ) : below the millimeter or for distances of the order or larger than the solar system characteristic size .",
    "long range tests are performed using the motion of planets and interplanetary probes .",
    "monitoring of the moon and mars delivers high precision tests of the validity of general relativity at these distances ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the navigation data of the pioneer probes show a discrepancy with respect to the predictions of general relativity @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy can be described as an anomalous acceleration directed toward the sun with a roughly constant amplitude of approximately @xmath0  m.s@xmath1 .",
    "the origin of this anomaly is yet unexplained despite a huge effort of the scientific community ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) : it may be an experimental artifact as well as a hint of considerable importance for fundamental physics @xcite . at larger scales , the rotation curves of galaxies and",
    "the relation between redshift and luminosities of supernovae are accounted for by introducing respectively `` dark matter '' and `` dark energy '' , which represent 25  % and 70  % of the energy content of the universe @xcite .",
    "since these dark components have been introduced on the basis of gravitational observations solely , the hypothesis that general relativity is not a correct description of gravitation at these scales needs to be considered @xcite .",
    "it is therefore essential to test gravitation at all distance scales . to this extend",
    ", several mission concepts have been proposed to improve the experiment made by the pioneer probes @xcite . in many proposals ,",
    "the addition of an accelerometer being able to measure without bias the non - gravitational acceleration of the spacecraft is central .",
    "esa included this idea in the roadmap for fundamental physics in space @xcite and recommended the development of accelerometer compatible with spacecraft tracking at the 10 pm.s@xmath1 level .",
    "this article presents such an instrument , called the gravity advanced package @xcite .",
    "first , a description of the instrument and its performances is given .",
    "then , the method used to make absolute measurement is described @xcite . finally , the expected improvements of the orbit reconstruction process using the instrument are briefly discussed .",
    "the gravity advanced package is an important technological upgrade for future fundamental physics missions in space .",
    "it is composed of two subsystems : microstar is a three - axis electrostatic accelerometer @xcite based on onera s experience @xcite , and the bias rejection system is a rotating stage with piezo - electric actuator used to rotate microstar around its @xmath2  axis .",
    "the accelerometer aims at measuring the non - gravitational acceleration of the spacecraft but other quantities are also measured .",
    "in fact , microstar measures the components of the vector @xmath3 on its three orthogonal measurement axis called @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 : @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the masses of the satellite and the proof mass respectively , @xmath9 is the non - gravitational force acting on the spacecraft , @xmath10 is the rotation vector of the instrument with respect to a galilean reference frame , @xmath11 is the vector between the center of mass of the satellite and the instrument ( lever arm ) , @xmath12 is the gravity of the spacecraft , and the last term in parenthesis is the gravity gradient expressed in term of acceleration , @xmath13 and @xmath14 being the gravitational forces acting on the satellite and the proof mass respectively .",
    "all these additional terms can be removed @xcite .",
    "of course , the measurement is plagued by scale ( @xmath15 ) and quadratic factors ( @xmath16 ) , by bias ( @xmath17 ) and by noise ( @xmath18 ) , such that the actual measurement on the axis @xmath19 is : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the projection of @xmath3 on the axis @xmath22 .",

    "[ fig : noise ] ) : @xmath24    \\label{eq : acc_noise}\\ ] ] the characterization of the noise can also be given in term of allan variance @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the cut - off frequency .",
    "a simplified expression of the allan variance ( avar ) @xcite for @xmath27 is : @xmath28   \\label{eq : allan}\\ ] ] figure [ fig : noise ] shows the dependence of allan variance with respect to integration time and cut - off frequency without the @xmath27 approximation .",
    "the bias rejection system rotates the accelerometer around the @xmath2 axis of a monitored angle called @xmath29 . assuming that the quadratic factors are equal to zero and that the scale factors are perfectly known , the quantities measured along the axis @xmath4 and @xmath5 are :    m_y = + b_y + n_y + m_z = + b_z + n_z    [ eq : measurement ]    with @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) being the components of the acceleration in the reference frame of the spacecraft .",
    "the method for removing the bias of the instrument consists in flipping microstar .",
    "the underlying idea is that when @xmath32  rad , the accelerometer measures the quantities @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and when @xmath35  rad , it measures @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "subtracting these measurements allows recovering the external signal without bias , under the assumption that they are constants .",
    "the complete method , which can handle time variations of the external signal and of the bias , is described in @xcite .",
    "it is shown in particular that the modulation signal , i.e. the time variation of @xmath29 , must fulfill some conditions in order to correctly remove the bias from the measurement ( cf .",
    "eq . ) .",
    "the modulation signal is supposed to be periodic , @xmath38 being the period . moreover , the measurements used for data post - processing are the ones made when the angle @xmath29 is constant with time and only two positions are considered : @xmath39  rad and @xmath40  rad ( so that assuming @xmath41 is not restrictive ) . on the contrary , the measurements made when the accelerometer is rotating are not used because they may be spoiled by unwanted signal ( vibration , fictitious acceleration ) .",
    "the duration of the rotation per period is called @xmath42 and will be referred to as the masking duration .",
    "arbitrary unit .",
    "two periods are represented , separated by circles ( @xmath43 ) * right : * the figure describes how the modulation signal changes when the ratio @xmath44 changes ( one period is represented ) .",

    "these conditions allow deriving the time variation of the angle @xmath29 , which is shown in figure [ fig : lin_signal ] ( left ) .",
    "the pattern depends on the ratio of the masking duration @xmath42 and the period @xmath38 , as shown by figure [ fig : lin_signal ] ( right ) .",
    "with such a signal and after post - processing , it is possible to recover the mean of the external signal without bias over a modulation period @xmath38 .",
    "it is possible to characterize these unbiased measurements in term of noise .",
    "the level of noise depends on the modulation period @xmath38 and the masking time @xmath42 but is approximately white as shown by figure [ fig : dsp ] ( left ) . for @xmath49",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , the gravity advances package ( gap ) aims at improving the orbit reconstruction of interplanetary probes so as to test the theories of gravitation .",
    "so far , models have been used to correct for the non - gravitational acceleration of the spacecrafts .",
    "but the computed orbit is then subject to errors due to uncertainties or inaccuracies in the models . by providing unbiased measurements of the non - gravitational acceleration in the orbit plane ,",
