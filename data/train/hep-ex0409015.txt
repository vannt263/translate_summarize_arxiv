    "the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix element @xmath4 can be extracted from the inclusive branching fraction for semileptonic @xmath5 hadron decays @xmath6@xcite .",
    "several studies have shown that the spectator model decay rate is the leading term in a well - defined expansion controlled by the parameter @xmath7 .",
    "non - perturbative corrections to this leading approximation arise only at order @xmath8 and above .",
    "the key issue in this approach is the ability to separate non - perturbative corrections , which can be expressed as a series in powers of @xmath9 , and perturbative corrections , expressed in powers of @xmath10 .",
    "the coefficients of the @xmath9 power terms are expectation values of operators that include non - perturbative physics .",
    "two different expansions exist , reflecting a difference in the approach used to handle the energy scale @xmath11 that separates long - distance from short - distance physics . in this note",
    ", we use the short distant mass expansion that defines the non - perturbative operators using a mass scale @xmath12 gev @xcite .",
    "the shape of the lepton spectrum provides constraints on the heavy quark expansion based on local operator product expansion ( ope ) , which calculates properties of the @xmath13 transitions .",
    "so far , measurements of the electron energy distribution have been made by the delphi , cleo , and babar collaborations @xcite . in this note",
    "we report a measurement of the first and second moment of the electron energy spectrum with a minimum electron momentum cut ranging between 0.6 and 1.5 gev in the @xmath0 meson rest frame .",
    "we measure , independently , the electron energy moments for the semileptonic decays of the @xmath14 and the @xmath15 mesons  @xcite .",
    "if quark hadron duality applies in @xmath16 decays then the moments from the @xmath14 and @xmath15 should agree . up to now",
    "such a measurement has been impossible to perform .",
    "however , in this measurement we find good agreement between the moments .",
    "the data used in this analysis was collected with the belle detector at the kekb  @xcite asymmetric energy @xmath3 collider .",
    "the belle  @xcite detector is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a three - layer silicon vertex detector ( svd ) , a 50-layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) , an array of aerogel threshold erenkov counters ( acc ) , a barrel - like arrangement of time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) , and an electromagnetic calorimeter comprised of csi(tl ) crystals ( ecl ) located inside a super - conducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5  t magnetic field .",
    "an iron flux - return located outside of the coil is instrumented to detect @xmath17 mesons and to identify muons ( klm ) .",
    "events are selected by fully reconstructing one of the @xmath0 mesons , produced in pairs from @xmath18 , in several hadronic decay modes .",
    "prompt semileptonic decays ( @xmath19 ) of the non - tag side @xmath0 mesons are separated from cascade charm decays ( @xmath20 ) , based on the correlation between the flavour of the tagged @xmath0 and the lepton charge .",
    "the present results are based on a @xmath1 data sample collected at the @xmath18 resonance , which contains @xmath21 @xmath22 pairs .",
    "an additional @xmath23 data sample taken at 60  mev below the @xmath18 resonance ( off@xmath24resonance ) is used to perform background subtraction from the @xmath25 process .",
    "we use a fully simulated generic monte carlo sample generated with the qq98 event generator @xcite .",
    "this sample is equivalent to about three times the beam luminosity of the real data .",
    "simulated events are required to satisfy tight hadron selection criteria .",
    "the hadronic decay of the tag - side @xmath0 meson is fully reconstructed in the decay modes @xmath26 , yielding a high purity @xmath0 meson sample .",
    "the following sub - decay modes are implemented :    * @xmath27 , * @xmath28 , * @xmath29 and * @xmath30 .    if multiple candidates are found in one event , we select the best candidate based on @xmath31 and other variables .",
    "there are two conditions that affect the best candidate selection .",
    "the candidate may be reconstructed from at least one particle from the other side @xmath0 , or the final state particles may be incorrectly reconstructed .",
    "we identify electrons produced in semileptonic @xmath0 decays on the `` non - tag '' side .",
    "low - momentum particles spiral in the cdc  detector .",
    "if the particles pass close to the interaction point more than once , they can lead to multiple reconstructed tracks .",
    "those tracks are removed .",
    "the remaining tracks are required to satisfy tight restrictions on the impact parameters .",
    "in addition , we require the tracks to be in the barrel region of the detector , corresponding to an angular acceptance of @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the polar angle of the track relative to the @xmath34 axis ( opposite the positron beam line ) .    tracks that pass the above selection criteria and are not used in the reconstruction of the tag - side @xmath0 meson are considered as electron candidates .",
    "electron identification is based on a combination of specific ionisation @xmath35 measurements in the cdc , the response of the acc , the shower shape in the ecl , and the ratio of energy deposit in the ecl to the momentum measured by the tracking system ( @xmath36 ) @xcite .",
    "the electron identification efficiencies include the detector acceptance as well as the selection efficiency .",
    "the errors for the tracking and electron detection efficiencies are @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "electron identification efficiency is determined by analysing a data sample where simulated single electron tracks are overlaid on hadronic events taken from real experimental data .",
    "the electron momentum spectrum is corrected by using this momentum dependent electron detection efficiency .",
    "the momentum of electron candidates is measured in the @xmath0 meson rest frame ( @xmath39 ) , exploiting the knowledge on the momentum of the fully reconstructed @xmath0 . to ensure a good electron identification performance we require @xmath40 gev/@xmath41 .",
    "backgrounds from @xmath42 , @xmath43 , photon conversions in the material of the detector , and dalitz decays from @xmath44 and @xmath45 mesons are reduced by imposing veto cuts .",
    "we look for additional electrons in the event , which satisfy looser identification criteria and @xmath46 gev/@xmath41 .",
    "we then calculate invariant masses ( @xmath47 ) for each electron candidate when combined with an opposite - charge electron that passes the loose selection . in the dalitz case",
    "we require an additional photon ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "we reject the electron if @xmath47 lies within the nominal @xmath42 and @xmath43 mass regions , or @xmath48 lies within the nominal @xmath44 and @xmath45 mass regions .",
    "to remove photon conversions we reject candidates by placing cuts on the vertex of the decay and @xmath47 less than 100 mev/@xmath49 .",
    "we select events containing a fully reconstructed @xmath0 candidate on one side and an electron candidate on the other side .    for each selected event , we calculate the beam - constrained mass @xmath50 and @xmath31 : @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the beam energy , the @xmath0 3-momentum and the @xmath0 energy in the centre of mass frame , respectively .",
    "events with @xmath55 and @xmath56 are considered to be signal candidates .",
    "each electron is assigned to the `` right sign '' sample if the electron has the opposite flavour to the fully reconstructed @xmath0 , and to the `` wrong sign '' sample if the electron has the same flavour as the fully reconstructed @xmath0 . in events without @xmath57 mixing ,",
    "the primary electrons belong to the `` right sign '' sample while the secondary electrons contribute to the `` wrong sign '' sample .",

    "the off@xmath24diagonal bins are filled due to bremstrahlung occurring in the material in front of the calorimeter .",
    "it is important to note , for the reliability of the unfolding , that the phase space covered by the generated energy spectrum is very similar to the reconstructed spectrum .",
    "we divide the generated energy in slices of 0.025 gev . for each slice",
    "we produce a histogram of the corresponding reconstructed energy spectrum , normalised to one .",
