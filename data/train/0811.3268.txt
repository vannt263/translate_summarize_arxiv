    "the recently discovered high temperature superconductivity in fluorine doped lafeaso have stirred new interest in the research of high-@xmath3 superconductors @xcite , outside of the cuprate family @xcite . replacing oxygen by fluorine introduces charge carriers which is eventually transferred from the la - o(f ) charge reservoir layer to the fe - as conductive layer .",
    "superconductivity emerges as the f doping concentration is higher than 5 % .",
    "subsequent research suggests that replacing the lanthanum in lafeaso with other rare earth elements such as cerium , samarium , neodymium and praseodymium leads to superconductors with elevated critical temperature up to 55 k @xcite .",
    "the first and most important question about the lafeaso - based new superconducting system is whether it has similar mechanism for superconductivity with cuprate superconductors or not . in cuprate superconductors ,",
    "the antiferromagnetic properties of the parent compounds have provoked scenarios of purely electronically driven superconductivity , where lattice effects are mostly ignored @xcite . on the other hand , various anomalous lattice effects have recently been observed in cuprates which closely correlate with the onset of superconducting transition , suggesting that lattice effects play an important microscopic role in the superconducting pairing mechanism @xcite . in particular , x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs ) measurements",
    "have shown that doping causes local lattice distortion which occurs well above @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "correlating data from inelastic neutron scattering and inelastic x - ray scattering , isotope effects , raman spectroscopy , infrared absorption spectroscopy and femtosecond optical spectroscopy have been proving that the anomalous local lattice distortion observed by exafs measurements is correlated with the opening of pseudogap and the formation of polarons @xcite .",
    "the change in dynamics , which is observed across the superconducting transition temperature , indicates an intimate link of the dynamics of these polarons with the mechanism of high - temperature superconductivity @xcite . in lafeaso - based superconductors , evidence of pseudogap evolutions similar to the high-@xmath3 cuprates",
    "has been reported @xcite .",
    "however , there is a lack of experimental data on the lattice effects . in order to find the appropriate mechanism",
    ", lattice effects can provide key information . in this paper we present results from fe and as k edge exafs measurements indicating that local fe - as",
    "lattice fluctuation occurs well above @xmath3 .",
    "similar to that in cuprates , this local lattice fluctuation is closely correlated with the onset of superconducting transition , indicating that the local lattice fluctuation is involved in the superconducting coherence in both systems .",
    "polycrystalline samples lafeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 ( @xmath4=0 ; 0.07 ) were prepared by solid state synthesis as described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "exafs measurements were performed at bl13b at photon factory , tsukuba .",
    "powder samples were mounted on an aluminum holder and attached to a closed - cycle helium refrigerator .",
    "the holder rotates on a high precision goniometer ( huber 420 ) to change the incidence angle .",
    "a novel ge pixel array detector ( pad ) with 100 segments was used in order to gain high throughput and energy resolution .",
    "the detailed description of pad apparatus was reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the experimental exafs , @xmath5(@xmath6 ) , was analyzed by use of the ifeffit analysis package .",
    "the fitting to experimental data was performed in both @xmath7 space and @xmath6 space , and the uncertainties were determined from a reduced @xmath5@xmath8 using standard techniques of error analysis .",
    "the fe and as @xmath9-edges exafs oscillations for lafeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 ( @xmath4=0 ; 0.07 ) are measured from 5 k and 300 k. the exafs oscillations at the fe and as @xmath9-edges are converted into @xmath6 space .",
    "typical exafs oscillations are shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) for the @xmath4=0.07 sample at the fe @xmath9 edge ( lower panel ) and the as @xmath9 edge ( upper panel ) .",
    "the fourier transform spectra at 20 k for the fe and as @xmath9 edges are shown as black curves in fig .",
    "1(b ) . the position of the coordination atoms of the fe and as atoms are also indicated which are slightly shifted due to the phase - shift effect .",
    "the atomic radial distribution function ( rdf ) around fe and as atoms are simulated using feff7 . in the simulation",
    "the structural parameters determined by rietveld analysis are used and all possible scattering paths ( including single - scattering paths and multiple - scattering paths ) are included @xcite .",
    "the simulated rdf around fe and as atoms are shown as the red curves in fig .",
    "1(b ) , which can reproduce all the main peaks in the experimental fourier transform spectra .    in the exafs data analysis process",
    ", coordination numbers are set to the values dictated by the average structure .",
    "for the fe @xmath9 edge , we fit the experimental data by including both the nearest neighboring fe - as correlation and the next nearest neighboring fe - fe correlation .",
    "typical fitting result is shown as the green curve in fig .",
    "it can be seen that the fitting curve can well reproduce the experimental data at 1.4@xmath10@xmath7@xmath103.1   range . for the as @xmath9 edge",
    ", we fit the experimental data using a single - gaussian as - fe rdf .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) as the green curve .",
    "figure 2 gives the temperature dependence of the fe - as bond distances and the fe - fe bond distances for both samples .",
    "it is obvious that the f - doping leads to a shrink of fe - as bond distance .",
    "the slight decrease of fe - as bond distance induced by f doping has been detected by synchrotron x - ray diffraction measurement @xcite .",
    "the contraction of the fe - as bond distance with f - doping indicates that the bonding between fe and as atoms is strengthened covalent bonding .",
    "the contraction of the fe - as bond distance is reminiscent of the shortening of the cu - o bond distance in la@xmath11sr@xmath1cuo@xmath12 as charge carriers are introduced into the cuo@xmath13 plane . in cuprate superconductors ,",
    "the cu - o orbital hybridization is strengthened with the shortening of the cu - o bond . according to this fact",
    ", we can also suggest that the hybridization between the fe 3@xmath14 orbitals and the as 4@xmath15 orbitals would be strengthened .",
    "the strengthening of the fe - as orbital hybridization favors the flow of charge carrier in the fe - as conductive layer .",
    "it is also obvious that the fe - fe bond distance is shortened in the f - doped sample , which indicates a decrease of the unit cell volume .",
    "we notice a slight increase of the fe - fe bond distance below @xmath2 150 k in undoped lafeaso , which is consistent with the tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition @xcite . in f - doped sample ,",
    "such a phase transition disappears . the temperature dependence of fe - fe bond distance for the f - doped sample shows little change in the whole temperature region .    in fig .",
    "3 we plot the temperature dependence of the mean - square relative displacement for the nearest neighboring fe - as shell derived from both fe @xmath9 edge exafs ( labeled as @xmath16@xmath17 ) and as @xmath9 edge exafs ( labeled as @xmath16@xmath18 ) for the lafeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 ( @xmath4=0.07 ) sample together with that of the undoped lafeaso sample .",
    "as expected , the results give nearly the same @xmath16@xmath17 and @xmath16@xmath18 values at each temperature . at @xmath19@xmath20150 k range",
    ", the @xmath16@xmath17 value decreases with decreasing temperature for both samples , consistent with the non - correlated debye - like behavior .",
    "however , below 150 k the temperature dependence of @xmath16@xmath17 exhibits distinctly different behavior . for undoped lafeaso ,",
    "the @xmath16@xmath17 value slightly increases with further decreasing temperature , which is related to the so - called spin - density - wave transition @xcite . for the f - doped sample , the increase of @xmath16@xmath17 at about 150 k",
    "is well suppressed .",
    "the @xmath16@xmath17 decreases further with decreasing temperature .",
    "significantly , an anomalous upturn of @xmath16@xmath17 appears at @xmath19@xmath1070 k. this anomaly occurs only in f - doped sample while no such anomaly is detected in undoped parent compound .",
    "this anomaly is accompanied by a sharp drop at the temperature where the onset of superconducting transition occurs ( @xmath21@xmath229 k ) .",
    "similar anomalous behavior was previously found in la@xmath11sr@xmath1cuo@xmath12 samples where an upturn of @xmath16@xmath22 ( mean - square relative displacement of the in - plane cu - o bond ) occurs at @xmath19@xmath1080 k which is also accompanied by a sharp decrease at @xmath21 @xcite . in order to clearly see the low temperature local lattice instability and its relation to the @xmath21 value , we plot in the inset of fig .",
    "3 the normalized temperature ( @xmath19/@xmath21 ) dependence of the mean - square relative displacements for both lafeaso@xmath23f@xmath24 and la@xmath25sr@xmath26cuo@xmath12 samples .",
    "it can be seen that a sharp decrease in the mean - square relative displacement occurs exactly at @xmath21 in both systems .",
    "this result indicates that the local lattice instability might be play an important role in the superconducting coherence in both systems .    in order to reveal whether or not this anomaly involves the fe - fe bond , we studied the temperature dependence of mean square relative displacement for the fe - fe bond ( @xmath16@xmath27 ) by fitting the fe @xmath9 edge exafs data including the multiple scattering paths .",
    "figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of @xmath16@xmath27 for the lafeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 ( @xmath4=0 ; 0.07 ) samples .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath16@xmath27 for the undoped lafeaso sample exhibits a slight increase below @xmath2140 k , which may relate to the sdw transition @xcite .",
    "it can be clearly seen that there is no anomaly in the mean - square relative displacement of the fe - fe bond in @xmath4=0.07 sample .",
    "thus we conclude that the anomaly in @xmath16@xmath17 below 70 k in f - doped sample involves only the fe - as bond . comparing the mean - square relative displacements of the fe - fe bond in lafeaso@xmath0f@xmath1",
    ", one can find a rather strong f - doping effect , i.e. , the displacement of fe - fe bond is strongly decreased upon f - doping .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath16@xmath17 shows a complicated behavior related to a magnetic phase transition .",
    "that is , an increase of @xmath16@xmath17 occurs below 140 k in undoped lafeaso . in lafeaso@xmath23f@xmath24 ,",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath16@xmath17 shows no anomaly in the whole temperature region , consistent with the disappearance of phase transition in f - doped samples .    to our knowledge macroscopic structural study on lafeaso - based system did not explore any structural transition near 70 k. however , in cuprate superconductors , a similar upturn of mean - square relative displacement of the in - plane cu - o bond has been discovered , which is related to the splitting of the cu - o bonds into elongated and shortened cu - o bond distances @xcite .",
    "based on this fact , we suggest that a bond splitting of the fe - as bond in f - doped lafeaso system also occurs below @xmath270 k. consequently , some as ions are shifted forward or backward the adjacent fe ions .",
    "this bond splitting would lead to a decrease of the magnitude of the fe - as ( as - fe ) rdf peak . in fig .",
    "5(a ) we plot the fourier transform magnitude of the first shell as - fe bond . in order to compare the magnitude as - fe peak quantitatively , we plot the absolute magnitude of the as - fe peak in fig",
    "the magnitude of the as - fe peak increases with decreasing temperature which is followed by a decrease below 70 k , consistent with the as - fe bond splitting model .    in order to quantitatively",
    "determine the length scale of the fe - as bond - splitting , we plot the fourier - filtered ( back - transforming over 1.4@xmath282.6  ) exafs oscillation and amplitude of the first - shell as - fe bond at 40 k. the plot is shown in fig .",
    "5(c ) . from the exafs oscillation",
    "we notice that the local minimum in the amplitude and the irregularity in the phase near 10.5 @xmath29 constitute a  beat \" , which signifies the presence of two as - fe bond distances . using the relation @xmath30@xmath7=@xmath31/2@xmath6 between the separation of the two shells and the position of the beat ,",
    "the as - fe distances are determined to differ by @xmath20.15  .",
    "we notice that the  beat \" feature is very weak , which possibly comes from two facts : one is that only small amount of fe - as bonds are splitted while the other fe - as bonds keep undistorted ; another reason could be the unpolarized property of the powder sample used in the exafs measurements .    in doped cuprates ,",
    "lattice instability is observed as local distortions ( creation of elongated and shortened bonds ) probed by exafs which reflects the presence of strong hole - lattice interaction @xcite . in case of doped lafeaso system ,",
    "similar behavior is found in both as and fe @xmath9 edge exafs .",
    "we note that this distortion is of electronic origin and is different from crystallographic phase transition as it is observed only after carrier doping at low temperature . the anomalous change below 70 k",
    "is explained using a local lattice distortion model having equal number of elongated and shortened fe - as bonds separated by about 0.15  . among candidates of distortion models characterized by the elongated and shortened fe - as bonds",
    ", we consider two cases in fig .",
    "6 which illustrates the distortion in the feas layer in f - doped lafeaso .",
    "the left panels show displacement of as atoms ( grey ball ) tetrahedrally coordinating with fe atoms . in the right , four - fold coordination of fe atoms is represented by pyramids where each corner indicates the location of as atom and the direction of displacement is indicated by arrow . in the upper model",
    "all four fe - as bonds in the same unit elongate and the shortening of bonds occur in the adjacent unit , while in the lower model the elongation and shortening occur in the same unit . in analogy to doped cuprates ,",
    "the former and latter models correspond to breezing @xcite and q@xmath13 @xcite distortions proposed for la@xmath25sr@xmath26cuo@xmath12 , respectively . in the lafeaso system",
    ", those two possible distortions may account for the detected distortion .",
    "we now discuss the implications of the present results .",
    "first , the temperature dependence of mean - square relative displacement of the fe - as bond shows remarkable similarity with that of cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "that is , a significant upturn in the temperature dependence of @xmath16@xmath17 in f - doped lafeaso ( or @xmath16@xmath22 in sr - doped la@xmath13cuo@xmath12 ) occurs at a characteristic temperature @xmath32 , which is related to the opening of pseudogap in cuprates @xcite . in lafeaso(f )",
    "system , the opening of pseudogap was recently reported @xcite , consistent with the observation of the onset of the upturn of @xmath16@xmath17 .",
    "we interpret this anomaly as a signature of lattice instability that indicates the formation of polarons .",
    "secondly , the increase of mean - square relative displacement continues until a sudden drop occurs at the onset of superconducting transition .",
    "the plot of mean - square relative displacement _",
    "vs_. normalized temperature ( @xmath33 ) clearly indicates that the mean - square relative displacement exhibits a large decrease at the onset superconducting transition temperature in both fe - based and cuprate superconductors , which indicates that the lattice effects might be important in both systems .",
    "however , whether or not the superconducting mechanism in these systems is driven by electron - lattice interaction needs further experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "in conclusion , we provide evidence from exafs measurements that local lattice instability occurs in f - doped lafeaso superconductor , similar to that in cuprate superconductors .",
    "this local lattice distortion may reveal certain polaron formation well above @xmath3 .",
    "the mean - square relative displacements of the fe - as bond exhibits a sharp drop at the onset transition temperature , indicating the lattice effects might be important in this system .",
    "the authors express their greatest thanks to h. koizumi for inspiring discussions .",
    "the exafs experiments were conducted under the proposal 2007g071 at photon factory ."
