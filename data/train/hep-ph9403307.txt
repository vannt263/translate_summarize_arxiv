    "supersymmetry ( susy)@xcite is increasingly being regarded as the most compelling of the various extensions of the standard model proposed to date . susy relates properties of bosons and fermions resulting in a new level of synthesis .",
    "supersymmetry also provides a technically natural framework for incorporating the higgs mechanism crucial for the breaking of electroweak symmetry . on the experimental front , while the measurements of the gauge couplings by the experiments at lep are inconsistent with minimal models of unification of gauge interactions , these measurements are in good agreement with the predictions of the simplest supersymmetric grand unified model@xcite . as an added bonus , supersymmetry provides a natural candidate for cosmological dark matter@xcite .",
    "despite these many attractive attributes of supersymmetric theories , no compelling model has as yet emerged . this could be due to the fact that the dynamics of supersymmetry breaking is not yet understood .",
    "in phenomenological analyses , supersymmetry breaking is incorporated by the introduction of soft susy breaking terms which do not jeopardize the stability of the electroweak mass scale in the presence of radiative corrections from very massive degrees of freedom not included in the sm ( these could be the particles of a grand unified theory ( gut ) , flavour physics at intermediate scales or effects of quantum gravity at the planck scale ) . even in the simplest low energy effective theories , the incorporation of all possible such soft breaking terms@xcite consistent with the known low energy symmetries leads to a proliferation of new parameters , greatly limiting the utility of this approach for susy phenomenology .",
    "this situation can be greatly ameliorated if the symmetries of the interactions that lead to the breaking of supersymmetry can be guessed at .",
    "for example , in a susy gut , if susy breaking is assumed to occur above the scale of gut breaking , the soft susy breaking masses and couplings of all particles in the complete multiplet are related .",
    "supergravity ( sugra ) models@xcite provide a very attractive realization of this idea of utilizing symmetries to restrict the supersymmetry breaking interactions .",
    "it is assumed that susy breaking in the effective low energy theory relevant for phenomenology arises due to gravitational interactions , which being universal , allow for only a few independent soft - supersymmetry breaking parameters ( a common scalar mass , a gaugino mass along with susy breaking trilinear , and possibly , bilinear susy breaking scalar coupling ) despite our ignorance of the details of the dynamics of susy breaking .",
    "all this , of course , holds at the ultra - high scale of susy breaking . in order to use the structure of the couplings thus obtained for perturbative calculations at the 100 gev energy scale relevant to experiment today",
    ", we must sum the large logarithms arising from the disparity of these scales .",
    "this is most conveniently done using the renormalization group technique@xcite whereby the soft breaking masses and couplings at the scale of electroweak breaking@xcite may be obtained . when mixing effects are negligible ( as is the case for the first two generations of sfermions ) or absent ( as for gluinos ) , these masses only differ slightly from the physical ( pole ) masses of the sparticles@xcite .",
    "the real beauty of this framework is that these same radiative corrections drive the desired breakdown of electroweak symmetry , leaving colour and electromagnetic gauge invariance intact . as a bonus ,",
    "supergravity models lead to ( approximate ) degeneracies of the first two generations of squarks which is required@xcite by the non - observation of flavour changing neutral currents in the k meson sector .",
    "it is interesting that the masses of @xmath3- and @xmath0- squarks may be significantly different ; this can lead to interesting phenomenological consequences as we will see below .",
    "while most phenomenological analyses of supersymmetry embody some of the ideas of supergravity guts , the observation that the lep data are consistent with the predictions of susy su(5 ) has led several groups@xcite to systematically study the implications of the simplest sugra su(5 ) model with radiative symmetry breaking constraints incorporated .",
    "it has been pointed out@xcite that these same data vitiate one of the earliest successes of non - susy su(5 ) gut  the prediction of the ratio @xmath4 from @xmath0-@xmath1 yukawa coupling unification .",
    "in contrast , the data are in agreement with the yukawa coupling unification in the sugra su(5 ) framework provided that the top quark mass is close to its infrared fixed point@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the implications of the simplest su(5 ) supergravity model with radiative symmetry breaking constraints incorporated .",
    "we will mainly focus on the detectability of the sparticle signals at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and especially , on whether these signals serve to distinguish this framework from the usually studied `` minimal susy '' framework@xcite . here , by simplest , we mean that we assume the fewest number of particles and the smallest number of soft - susy breaking parameters at the scale @xmath5 of gut symmetry breaking .",
    "more specifically , we assume :    1 .   a minimal set of soft susy breaking parameters at the gut scale @xmath6 gev , i.e. a common scalar mass @xmath7 , a common gaugino mass @xmath8 and common trilinear ( @xmath9 ) and bilinear ( @xmath10 ) soft breaking parameters .",
    "we do not assume any relation between @xmath9 and @xmath10 , though .",
    "2 .   minimal particle content at and below the scale @xmath5 .",
    "we recognize that these assumptions are sensitive to the unknown physics at high energy scales , and may well prove to be incorrect ; for instance , the assumption of a common gaugino mass might be invalid if there are non - minimal kinetic terms for the gauge fields@xcite .",
    "our point , however , is that at present even this very restrictive model can be claimed to be realistic in the sense it is compatible with all experimental constraints both from particle physics as well as from cosmology .",
    "moreover , as we will see , the fact that the top quark yukawa couplings are driven to their fixed point values results in supercollider signals that are characteristically different from previous studies@xcite . despite the fact that our analysis entails an extrapolation of physics over a very large range of energy , we believe that the simplicity of the model and the characteristic predictions of the scenario provide sufficient motivation for our analysis .    in the next section ,",
    "we discuss how the two assumptions together with various observational constraints from collider and non - accelerator experiments as well as from cosmological considerations further constrain the model parameters in this already restrictive framework .",
    "we also recapitulate how the sparticle spectrum and the susy parameters of the low energy theory are obtained and present representative examples of these . in section iii , we study the general features of the various scenarios obtained with our assumptions , and discuss how these differ from those usually considered in phenomenological analyses within the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) framework . in the next section",
    "we briefly describe our simulation of sparticle production at hadron colliders using isajet 7.07@xcite and discuss various improvements that we have recently incorporated into the program . in section",
    "v , we discuss various susy signals that might be expected at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) in the representative scenarios introduced above . we show that an observable signal may be expected in various event topologies including in single lepton and dilepton + @xmath11 samples , which are usually thought to be obscured by large sm backgrounds . here , and in the next section",
    ", we discuss how the simultaneous observation of a signal in several channels can serve to differentiate the sugra su(5 ) from the mssm framework , and also , to distinguish between the various illustrative supergravity scenarios .",
    "we conclude with a summary of our results and some general remarks .",
    "in this section , we first overview the relations between mass parameters at the weak scale in the minimal sugra model .",
    "we then describe various theoretical and experimental constraints that we impose , and show that despite these , it is possible to find viable solutions even in our theoretically restricted scenario .    at the high scale @xmath5 , we start@xcite with the common gaugino mass @xmath8 , the common scalar mass @xmath7 , the higgsino - mixing parameter @xmath12 , the soft susy breaking trilinear ( bilinear ) couplings @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , together with the yukawa couplings @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( with @xmath15 at scale @xmath5 ; see below ) .",
    "the absence of any intermediate scales implies that all parameters at the weak scale can be determined uniquely from the input parameters at @xmath5 , by solving a set of renormalization group equations ( rge ) @xcite .",
    "of course , the above set of parameters should reproduce the correct size of symmetry breaking , or @xmath16 , @xmath2 ( as a input ) , @xmath17 and @xmath18 at the weak scale ; this leads to constraints between the parameters at @xmath5 .",
    "we do not assume any relationship between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "in practice we use the ratio of vacuum expectation values @xmath19 as an input parameter .",
    "using the equations describing the minimization of the higgs potential at the weak scale then allows us to express @xmath20 and @xmath21 at the weak scale in terms of @xmath22 and @xmath19 @xcite ; note that the renormalization group equations for @xmath20 and @xmath23 decouple from all other rge .",
    "the constraint of proper electroweak symmetry breaking therefore reduces the number of free input parameters to five , which we take to be @xmath24 and @xmath19 ; in addition , the sign of @xmath23 needs to be specified .",
    "these considerations lead to simple relations between gaugino mass parameters ( @xmath25 ) and first and second generation sfermion masses at the weak scale .",
    "the rg running of the masses of strongly interacting particles implies large positive corrections to squark and gluino mass parameters , while corrections to the electroweak interacting particles stay relatively small .",
    "numerically , @xmath26 , and the soft susy - breaking gaugino masses are related by @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the higgs mass parameters and third generation squark masses receive significant radiative corrections from yukawa interactions in addition to those from gauge interactions . at @xmath5",
    "our ansatz requires the two higgs mass parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 to be equal : @xmath32 .",
    "as is well known , this equality implies that the tree  level potential can not simultaneously lead to nonzero vacuum expectation values and be bounded from below .",
    "quantum effects , i.e. the running of the mass parameters of the scalar potential , thus become crucial for gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "radiative @xmath33 symmetry breaking is in fact a natural prediction of this model , given the large size of the top yukawa coupling .",
    "more explicitly , @xmath34 receives a negative radiative correction proportional to @xmath35 times some function of soft susy breaking parameters when going towards the weak scale , due to its interaction with the top quark . on the other hand @xmath36",
    "is insensitive to @xmath37 , thereby lifting the equality between higgs mass parameters .",
    "if @xmath37 is very large , @xmath34 becomes negative well above the weak scale , resulting in too large a value of @xmath22 or even an unbounded higgs potential .",
    "this can be compensated by choosing @xmath21 to be large . in other words",
    ", @xmath21 has to be increased along with @xmath37 in order to maintain @xmath16 at its correct value .",
    "we now turn to the constraints coming from our assumption of a minimal susy @xmath38 gut .",
    "the minimality of the @xmath38 higgs sector immediately implies the equality of the bottom and tau yukawa couplings at the unification scale .",
    "several recent studies@xcite have shown that this is only compatible with the measured values of @xmath0 quark and @xmath1 lepton masses if the top yukawa coupling is large , i.e. close to its `` fixed point '' value@xcite .",
    "this conclusion persists even if the ratio @xmath39 is varied about unity by 10% to account for uncertainties due to threshold effects .",
    "this immediately leads to the prediction @xmath40 where @xmath2(@xmath2 ) is the running ( @xmath41 ) mass .",
    "since we only use 1loop rge everywhere , we simply interpreted eq.([sug1 ] ) to mean @xmath42 taking the on  shell top quark mass @xmath43 gev@xcite , we find @xmath44 @xcite , in general agreement with the constraints on it from nucleon decay@xcite which we now turn to .",
    "in susy guts , the exchange of higgsino triplets can lead to a dangerously short lifetime of the proton .",
    "in minimal susy @xmath38 its exact value depends on many parameters .",
    "in particular , the lifetime increases with increasing mass of the higgsino triplet .",
    "since the dimension5 operators induced by higgsino triplet exchange need to be  dressed \" by loops involving squarks and gauginos ( chargino loops usually being dominant ) , contributions from ( s)quarks of different generations in the loop add coherently .",
    "this opens the possibility to increase the total lifetime , at the cost of some fine  tuning , by cancelling contributions involving third generation ( s)quarks against those involving only the first two generations .",
    "the `` dressing loop function '' can be decreased , and hence proton decay can be suppressed , by choosing scalars ( squarks and sleptons ) to be considerably heavier than gauginos . for given values of the other parameters",
    "the lower bound on the proton lifetime therefore translates into an upper bound on the ratio @xmath45 . in view of the various uncertainties@xcite of this calculation",
    "we have conservatively required@xcite , @xmath46 the coefficient 3 on the right hand side has been chosen so that the contribution @xmath47 to @xmath48 described earlier dominates the one @xmath49 , which implies @xmath50 .    finally , we require our model to be cosmologically acceptable .",
    "because the mssm has a conserved r parity , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is stable .",
    "thus the lsp can be a good candidate for the missing cosmological mass density , or dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "large @xmath21 means that the lightest neutralino , which is also lsp in this scenario , is dominantly a gaugino .",
    "the constraint eq.([sug3 ] ) implies that lsp annihilation via the @xmath51channel exchange of sfermions is suppressed , leading to a dangerously large relic abundance ( or small age of the universe ) unless lsp annihilation is enhanced by the proximity of an @xmath52channel pole .",
    "this is not as unnatural as it sounds , since recent studies@xcite have shown very large pole enhancements even if the lsp mass is several gev below half the mass of the boson exchanged in the @xmath52channel .",
    "our large values of @xmath23 and @xmath7 and the rather small value of @xmath53 force most higgs bosons to be heavy , the exception , of course , being the lighter neutral scalar @xmath54 .",
    "this is because @xmath36 does not receive large negative radiative correction from yukawa interactions if @xmath53 is small , while @xmath55 with @xmath56 from the minimization of the higgs potential .",
    "the condition eq.([sug3 ] ) then implies @xmath57 .",
    "therefore only the @xmath58 boson and the light higgs boson can contribute significantly to lsp annihilation .    in our computation of the higgs sector",
    ", we have included one loop corrections from top and bottom ( the latter are small ) yukawa interactions to both masses and trilinear higgs interactions using the effective potential@xcite ; note that these corrections are _ not _ contained in the rge discussed above . despite the large top yukawa coupling , we find that @xmath59 is bounded from above by about 110 gev for the values of @xmath53 we are considering .",
    "moreover , @xmath54 is always sm  like in this scenario , due to the large masses of the other higgs bosons .",
    "hence the lep bound of 62.5 gev applies for it as well .",
    "this then leads to bounds on the mass of a cosmologically acceptable lsp , and hence on the gaugino mass : @xmath60 finally , we impose the limit @xmath61 in order to avoid excessive fine tuning .",
    "we should mention a technical complication that arises from the constraint ( [ sug3 ] ) as a result of which squarks are substantially heavier than gluinos .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that the pole gluino mass receives additional corrections proportional to @xmath62 . since one of the features of these scenarios , as we will see , is a rather light gluino , these extra corrections  which can be as large as 30%  can be significant .",
    "we have incorporated these into our program using the formulae in ref.@xcite .",
    "our apparently innocuous assumption of minimal particle content at the gut scale led to the various constraints on model parameters as we have just discussed .",
    "most analyses require _ either _ the equality of @xmath0 and @xmath1 yukawa couplings at @xmath5 , _ or _ an acceptably long lifetime for the proton , but not both .",
    "it seems to us that these two constraints are really on very similar theoretical footing in that they can both be weakened or even avoided completely if one allowed a more complicated higgs sector and/or a larger gut group@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , we do not try to find correlations between the value of the strong coupling constant and the overall size of susy breaking masses .",
    "given the present ( mostly theoretical ) error of @xmath63 , and in view of further uncertainties at the high scale we do not consider any `` bounds '' on sparticle masses derived in this fashion to be reliable at present .",
    "we now turn to a discussion of the characteristics of the fixed point scenario outlined above , and give some illustrations of the spectra and the sparticle mixing patterns that may be anticipated in this class of models .",
    "the characteristic feature of the fixed point scenario of the last section is the large top yukawa coupling , eq .",
    "( [ sug1 ] ) .",
    "this , as we have seen , leads to @xmath64 , assuming the radiative breaking mechanism of electroweak symmetry . together with eq .",
    "( [ sug3 ] ) , this then implies that the lighter ( heavier ) charginos and neutralinos are gaugino- ( higgsino- ) like in character .",
    "the limit eq .",
    "( [ sug4 ] ) implies that gluinos can not be much heavier than about 400 gev and may even be light enough to be discovered at the tevatron .",
    "we have also seen that the pseudoscalar ( @xmath65 ) , the charged ( @xmath66 ) and the heavier neutral scalar ( @xmath67 ) higgs bosons all tend to be heavy , so that these will not be produced via cascade decays of gluinos@xcite .",
    "finally , we make the obvious remark , @xmath68 so that the squarks of the first two families dominantly decay to gluinos",
    ".    another important consequence of the large top family yukawa interactions is the sizable reduction of the susy  breaking masses of scalar top quarks , and further , the mass squared of @xmath69 is reduced twice as much as that of @xmath70 . by @xmath71 invariance",
    "this means that the mass of left  handed scalar bottom quarks will also be reduced compared to squarks of the first two generations .",
    "the top squark masses are further altered by squark mixing , which depresses the lighter state even further .",
    "this non  degeneracy of third generation squarks , which is one of the characteristic features of minimal sugra models with radiative gauge symmetry breaking is accentuated by the large value of @xmath37 in the model .    in spite of the rather strong constraints on parameter space",
    ", we found that there is still considerable room for variation in the expected phenomenology .",
    "while condition ( [ sug3 ] ) implies that masses of the first and second generation squarks are well above the gluino mass no such statement can be made for the lighter stop eigenstate @xmath72 .",
    "in particular , it is possible that the two body decay @xmath73 is allowed@xcite , in which case it will have a branching ratio near 100% , being the only two  body decay mode of @xmath74 .",
    "we remind the reader that it has been shown in ref.@xcite that signals from a relatively light @xmath3-squark may well have escaped detection at the fermilab tevatron , although with the accumulation of a large data sample , its detection may be possible@xcite .    despite the various constraints that we have imposed it is impossible to do an exhaustive scan of parameter space .",
    "moreover , for the purposes of this study , the main question is not whether it is possible to detect supersymmetry at the lhc ( for the light spectrum we have this has already been answered affirmatively@xcite ) , but whether it is possible to distinguish the present class of models from the usually studied mssm , and further , whether it is possible to distinguish the various scenarios ( discussed shortly ) from one another . toward this end",
    ", we have attempted to choose model parameters ( respecting the constraints discussed in sec .",
    "ii ) that accentuate the qualitative differences in the signals .    at hadron colliders , squarks and gluinos",
    "are the most copiously produced particles . since , within our framework , the first two generations of squarks dominantly decay to gluinos",
    ", we expect that the gluino decay patterns fix the broad features of the phenomenology .",
    "this immediately leads us to consider two classes of scenarios : ( a ) where the decay @xmath73 is allowed , and ( b ) where it is forbidden .",
    "case a naturally subdivides into two cases determined by the decay pattern of the lighter @xmath3-squark . in case a1 , we assume that the decay @xmath75 is accessible ; since this is the only tree - level two body decay , its branching fraction is essentially 100% . in case a2 ,",
    "we assume that the decay @xmath75 is kinematically inaccessible ; in this case the stop decays@xcite via one loop diagrams into a charm jet and an lsp : @xmath76 .    turning to the heavier stop ,",
    "case b , we have attempted to diversify the phenomenology by choosing combinations of @xmath7 and @xmath8 at their maximum and minimum values discussed in sec .",
    "ii . this leads to four cases b1b4 .    *",
    "b1 : @xmath8 and @xmath77 small , * b2 : @xmath8 small ; @xmath77 large , * b3 : @xmath8 large ; @xmath77 small , * b4 : @xmath8 and @xmath77 large .",
    "notice that for the case b1 where both squarks and gluinos are at their minimum phenomenologically acceptable values , the gluino may even be accessible at the tevatron .",
    "our point in analysing this case is more to illustrate the diversity of phenomena that could result even in this restricted framework , and to study the range of parameters over which distinguishable signals may be possible at the lhc .",
    "the input parameters , the resulting spectra and the values of @xmath23 at the weak scale in these six cases are shown in table i. several features are worth pointing out .",
    "* we see that the gluinos are relatively light . as noted above , gluino signals in case b1 ( and ,",
    "possibly , b2 ) may even be observable at the tevatron .",
    "* it is striking to see that in case a2 , @xmath78 is only 84 gev ; a significant number of @xmath79-pair events should , therefore , be present in the existing data sample at the tevatron .",
    "as pointed out in ref.@xcite such a light stop squark may well have escaped detection at the tevatron especially since the lsp is rather heavy in this case .",
    "it should , however , be remembered that both the experiments at the tevatron have since accumulated at least 15 - 20 @xmath80 , so that the detectability of the stop at the tevatron merits a reevaluation@xcite .",
    "it would indeed be interesting to study whether stop squark signals in cases a and b2 might be detectable at the tevatron .",
    "* the lighter chargino and the second lightest neutralino in b1 and b2 should be kinematically accessible at lep ii .",
    "for the other cases in table i , their accessibility will obviously depend on the energy that lep ii is finally able to attain .",
    "since , as remarked above , both @xmath81 and @xmath82 are dominantly gaugino - like ( and selectrons are heavy ) , their production at lep ii will be suppressed . for cases",
    "b1 and b2 , the trilepton signal from @xmath83 production at the tevatron should be present at observable rates . in the other cases",
    "illustrated , the trilepton cross section ( after experimental cuts ) is @xmath841 @xmath85@xcite , and hence , is unlikely to be observable .",
    "this is because we have @xmath86 so that , unlike as in no - scale models , the leptonic branching ratios are not dynamically enhanced . *",
    "the light higgs boson @xmath54 is essentially the sm higgs boson .",
    "it should , therefore , certainly be detectable at lep ii in case b1 , while the detectability in the other cases will be sensitive to the machine energy that is ultimately achieved .",
    "* we note that the top quark is necessarily within the reach of the tevatron , and further , its decays are as given by the sm except in case a2 where the decay @xmath87 has a branching fraction of @xmath88% . *",
    "finally , we see that as noted above , @xmath89 is indeed considerably smaller than the mass of the first two generations of squarks .",
    "this implies that three body gluino decays mediated by @xmath90 exchange are enhanced relative to those mediated by other squarks . as a result ,",
    "gluino events in cases b may be expected to have a higher multiplicity of @xmath20 mesons than would be expected if all squarks are taken to be degenerate as in most mssm studies .",
    "it is amusing to note that @xmath91 events may be even richer in @xmath20 s for cases a , since then , decays of @xmath3 quarks from @xmath92 as well as the decays @xmath93 ( in case a1 ) lead to @xmath20 meson production .",
    "we also note that because @xmath90 is relatively light , @xmath94 decays can also be considerably enhanced relative to @xmath95 decays .",
    "we thus see that the presence of light third generation squarks leads to susy events that should be rich in @xmath20 mesons .",
    "such events may also occur within the mssm framework where cascade decays of gluinos to higgs bosons can result in events with a high multiplicity of @xmath0 quarks@xcite .",
    "however , these cascade decays can occur only when @xmath96 exceeds the lighter higgs boson mass which , for the sm higgs bosons , is bounded below by 63.5 gev@xcite .",
    "thus , within the mssm framework , these events occur only when gluinos are rather heavy . in other words ,",
    "the detection of @xmath20-rich gluino events with event kinematics corresponding to gluino masses smaller than 400 gev could signal a light third generation of squarks .",
    "next , we briefly describe the improvements that we have made in isajet 7.07@xcite to simulate supersymmetry events at hadron colliders that we use to compute event rates , topologies and kinematic distributions for the six cases listed in table i.",
    "the main production processes and decay modes of all sparticles as given by the minimal supersymmetric model have been incorporated into isajet@xcite which we use for all our simulations . in order to allow for the possibility that the third generation of squarks may be substantially lighter than the first two generations , which is the distinguishing characteristic of the scenario",
    ", we have had to make several modifications to the code . in isajet 7.07 ,    1 .",
    "we have included the production and decays of @xmath3-squarks .",
    "we have modified the input parameters to the program .",
    "in addition to the sm parameters ( including @xmath2 ) the current low energy inputs in terms of which sparticle masses and decay patterns are computed are ( @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath53 , @xmath23 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 ) .",
    "the last five entries are new modifications and allow for independent mass and mixing pattern for the third squark generation .",
    "the stop and sbottom masses are the respective soft susy - breaking mass parameters and not the physical squark masses .",
    "since @xmath90 and @xmath108 belong to the same su(2 ) doublet , @xmath109 .",
    "we have neglected d - term contributions that break the degeneracy between the l- and r - type squarks of the first two generations but have retained these in the computation of slepton masses  this is the only reason for the difference in the @xmath110 and @xmath111 masses . for heavy squarks ,",
    "this d - term splitting is generally small , and so , makes little difference in the computations of squark production cross sections or gluino , chargino and neutralino decays mediated by virtual squarks .",
    "this splitting can be very important when squarks and gluinos are close in mass , since then some of the two - body gluino decay modes may become accessible . in the present study , this is never the case because of the constraint ( [ sug3 ] ) .",
    "3 .   the input gluino mass is the physical pole mass@xcite as opposed to the running @xmath112 mass that enters the gaugino - higgsino mass matrices . in all the cases in table i ,",
    "the pole mass is somewhat larger than the @xmath112 mass , primarily because the squarks are heavier than gluinos . for case b2 , where the gluino is light and squarks are at their maximal value , this difference is almost 50 gev .",
    "4 .   in the computation of the higgs boson masses and couplings",
    ", we have , as already mentioned , incorporated radiative corrections from both top and bottom yukawa interactions , including mixing between third generation squarks .",
    "we have not included effects of virtual gauge boson and gaugino loops , but these are known to be small@xcite .",
    "we have supplemented the various sparticle decay formulae to account for non - degenerate third generation sparticles",
    ". this can be especially important for gluino three body decays , as well as the corresponding neutralino decays .",
    "we have also included contributions to three body @xmath82 decays mediated by higgs bosons ; these can be important for large values of @xmath23 and @xmath98 for which the contributions from both @xmath58 and squark mediated decays are dynamically suppressed . as a result",
    ", @xmath82 decays to heavy quarks and leptons may be enhanced .",
    "for every set of input parameters , the routine isasusy calculates all sparticle masses along with branching fractions for all their allowed decay modes .",
    "of course , the input parameters are correlated by the minimal su(5 ) supergravity constraints discussed above .",
    "we then use isajet to generate supersymmetric particle pairs in @xmath113 collisions . in each run",
    ", isajet is set up to simultaneously generate all allowed sparticle pairs in numbers proportional to the corresponding pair production cross section .",
    "we use the ehlq set i structure functions@xcite for our computations of cross sections at the lhc .",

    "( _ iv _ ) events with three isolated leptons ( @xmath156 ) ;    ( _ v _ ) and events with four isolated leptons ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "table iii gives an overview of the cross sections for these event topologies for the six sugra cases in table i along with the cross sections for the major sm backgrounds .",
    "also shown are the corresponding cross sections for the four `` mssm '' cases introduced in sec .",
    "the cross sections shown here include the various cuts mentioned above , as well as additional cuts ( discussed below ) for the @xmath11 , the @xmath158 and the os dilepton signals which are known to have large sm backgrounds .",
    "as we will see , these additional cuts are essential to suppress the sm background , particularly to the @xmath158 and @xmath159 signals to acceptable levels .",
    "we see from table iii that for all but the @xmath158 signal in case b4 , the signal to background ratio exceeds unity , and is frequently considerably larger .",
    "furthermore , we see that the cross sections in the @xmath11 , @xmath158 and dilepton channels range from 1 - 100 @xmath160 so that @xmath161-@xmath162 signal events may be expected annually at the lhc even for a luminosity of @xmath161 pb@xmath163/year .",
    "we also see that except for case a2 , several thousand trilepton events may be expected every year at the lhc .",
    "we have been unable to identify any significant sm physics background to this signal .",
    "finally , we note that while there is some variation of the signals for the different scenarios in table iii , these cross sections alone do not enable us to unambiguously distinguish between all the various cases , or for that matter even between the sugra and the `` mssm '' cases .",
    "this requires a more detailed study of the various signals which we now turn to .",
    "this is generally regarded as the canonical signal for supersymmetry .",
    "backgrounds in this channel can be very dependent on detector details , especially forward calorimetry , and realistic bg estimates require a detailed calorimeter simulation .",
    "nevertheless , we estimate backgrounds from several major sm sources using our toy calorimeter and isajet : @xmath164 pair production , for @xmath165 gev , @xmath166 production , @xmath167 production , and heavy flavor ( @xmath168 and @xmath169 ) production .",
    "considerable background rejection with relatively little cost to signal can be gained by requiring , in addition ,    * @xmath170 gev , where the sum is over all calorimeter cells .",
    "the impact of this cut on the signal and the various backgrounds is shown in the @xmath11 column of table iv .",
    "the values ( inside ) outside the parenthesis indicate the signal cross section ( before ) after this additional cut . while this cut is not essential in that the signal to background ratio substantially exceeds unity even before the cut , we see that implementing the cut results in a significant improvement of this ratio with only a modest loss of signal .",
    "the largest @xmath11 cross sections come from the low @xmath8 ( light gluino ) cases , where the total production cross sections are largest . in order to facilitate distinction between the different scenarios in table iii ,",
    "we exhibit various characteristics of the @xmath11 events in table v. in columns 3 - 5 , we list the fraction of events with jet multiplicities @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "the most noticeable difference occurs in the @xmath173 channel , where we see several sugra cases yield large fractions of events with very high jet multiplicity .",
    "this is especially true of cases a1 , a2 and b4 .",
    "for instance , in a1 , many of the events come from gluino pair production , where @xmath174 , which can yield up to twelve ` parton level ' jets .",
    "of course , it is very difficult for the sm background processes to yield such high jet multiplicities .",
    "we also list in table v the fraction of events containing identifiable displaced @xmath0-vertices , @xmath175 .",
    "an important point is that supersymmetry events often have high multiplicity of @xmath20 hadrons@xcite in the central region .",
    "this is even more so in the sugra cases we have generated .",
    "we see that in the sugra cases , from @xmath176 of the @xmath11 events have at least one identifiable @xmath20 vertex , compared to @xmath177 for the btw cases ( of course , larger b multiplicities are also possible in the btw cases when cascade decays of gluinos into higgs bosons become operative .",
    "however , this occurs for considerably larger values of @xmath97 . ) . also , the sugra cases can have large fractions of events with @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "there are several reasons for this :    * in case a1 with the richest @xmath20 content , each gluino in gluino pair events decays via @xmath180 , which automatically yields at least four @xmath20 s per event since the @xmath3-quark as well as the @xmath79 squark decay into a @xmath0 , * the fact that @xmath90 is generally lighter than the first two generation squarks means that three body gluino decay via a virtual @xmath90 is enhanced , yielding a large branching fraction for @xmath181@xcite , * neutralino three body decays such as @xmath118 are frequently enhanced , either because of the smaller @xmath90 mass , or due to the importance of higgs boson mediated diagrams discussed in sec .",
    "of course , the exact @xmath0 multiplicity will depend on the tagging efficiency that is ultimately attained .",
    "the ability to tag @xmath20 vertices may also be very helpful in obtaining an enriched susy sample , and thus aid in susy particle mass estimates .",
    "we also show in table v the mean summed scalar @xmath182 and mean @xmath11 in @xmath183 events .",
    "use has already been made of @xmath184 to enhance susy signal against background .",
    "the scalar @xmath182 distribution is somewhat sensitive to the magnitude of the susy particle masses produced in the subprocesses although this is not clear from just the mean values listed in table v. we also remark that the differences between the various cases are somewhat reduced by the hard @xmath184 cut .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "1 the @xmath185 distribution of the fastest jet in @xmath11 events , for four sugra cases , and the sum of backgrounds . the sugra cases have @xmath185 which peaks around @xmath186 gev , with a broad tail extending to higher @xmath185 s , unlike sm background .",
    "since squarks of the same mass are expected to lead to harder jets than gluinos , it is natural to ask whether squark production shows up as a shoulder in this distribution . a glance at fig .",
    "1 shows that this will be difficult .",
    "we remark though that the hard cuts that we have imposed to enhance the signal selects out events with similar kinematics and so reduces the differences between the various signals .",
    "little effort has gone into searches for susy in the single lepton channel , due in part to large backgrounds expected from @xmath166 production and @xmath164 production . within our framework , the production rate of ( the rather light ) gluinos is truly enormous at the lhc so that one may hope to be able to make rather stringent cuts to eliminate the backgrounds , leaving behind an observable signal .",
    "a glance at the cross sections in parenthesis listed in the @xmath158 column of table iv shows that the single lepton cross section is smaller than the sm background except in case b1 . to facilitate further separation between the susy signal and the sm background , we show in fig .",
    "2 _ a _ ) the @xmath184 and _ b _ ) transverse mass @xmath187 distributions for four sugra cases a1 , a2 , b1 and b4 , along with the summed background distribution .",
    "the scalar @xmath182 distribution is substantially harder than sm background .",
    "since both the top and the @xmath188 backgrounds dominantly contain one leptonically decaying @xmath188 boson , the transverse mass distribution for the background rises to a jacobian peak at @xmath189 while that for the signal is relatively smooth .",
    "hence , to maximize signal against background , we further require :    * @xmath170 gev , and * @xmath190 gev , or @xmath191 gev .",
    "the resultant cross sections are shown in tables iii and iv , in the @xmath158 column .",
    "the total sm background is @xmath192 , while signal ranges between @xmath193 . in order to get some idea of the hardness of the leptons in the @xmath158 sample , the @xmath194 distribution after all the above cuts",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "2_c_. in case b1 , where single leptons are apt to come from light chargino decay , a distortion of the low @xmath194 distribution can occur ; for other cases , where leptons come from @xmath3-quark decay , the distribution more nearly tracks the shape of the background .",
    "various characteristics of single lepton events are detailed in table vi .",
    "the general features are similar to those of table v. the jet multiplicity is again large , especially for events with larger gluino masses , while jet multiplicities for sm backgrounds are substantially smaller .",
    "furthermore , the susy signal events , especially for cases a1 , a2 and b4 , are characterized by large fractions with visible displaced @xmath20 vertices .",
    "the sugra cases , except for case b2 , all have @xmath178 substantially larger than the corresponding btw values , and hence could yield evidence for a sugra - type of sparticle spectrum , where some of the third generation squarks are far lighter than squarks of the first two generations .      as for the case of single lepton events , searches for susy in the isolated opposite sign dilepton channel",
    "have rarely been considered due to a large expected background from @xmath164 events . within our framework , however , we see from the cross sections in parenthesis in the os column in table iv that , with just the canonical cuts discussed above , the dilepton signal exceeds that background in the favourable cases a1 , b1 and b2 .",
    "furthermore , it is only between a factor 2 - 6 smaller than the background in the other cases . in fig .",
    "3_a _ we plot the @xmath184 distribution , for which the signal gives a substantially harder spectrum than background .",
    "we see that the additional requirement ,    * @xmath170 gev ,    reduces the background by a factor of seven , with only modest loss of signal , particularly for the cases a2 , b3 and b4 where the signal was considerably below background . the cross sections after all cuts are shown in tables iii and iv , in the os columns .",
    "signal exceeds background for cases a1 , b1 and b2 , and is comparable in the other sugra cases . the @xmath194 distribution for fast and slow leptons after the above cuts is shown in fig .",
    "3_b _ and 3_c_. the overall hardness of these distributions depends in part on the susy sources of the dileptons . in cases a1 and a2 , many of the leptons are quite hard , coming from top quark decay , while in cases b2 and b4 the leptons frequently come from three body chargino and neutralino decay , and exhibit a softer spectrum . for os dileptons produced in gluino and squark events , either the leptons",
    "each separately come from the two susy particles produced in the hard scattering , or the two leptons can come from a single susy particle cascade , such as @xmath195 . in the former case , the dilepton pair is expected to have a large opening angle in the transverse plane , whereas in the latter case , the opening angle is expected to be small .",
    "this is borne out in the behavior of fig .",
    "4 . in cases b2 and to a smaller extent in case b4 ( cases b1 and b3 are similar to b1 and b4 , respectively ) , where there is substantial neutralino production via cascade decays , the dileptons come with a small opening angle . in case a1 the dileptons",
    "are somewhat peaked at large opening angle , though the peak is not as pronounced as in cases b2 and b4 .",
    "this is because the os dileptons can come from either the same gluino ( from the leptonic decay of its @xmath3 and @xmath79 daughters ) or from different gluinos and the cuts tend to favour leptons from top decays to those from the decays of stop .    we show os lepton event characteristics in table vii .",
    "the sugra cases again show large jet multiplicity , and large @xmath20 hadron multiplicity ; the latter quantity can again serve to distinguish sugra events from the mssm btw cases .",
    "just as with dilepton opening angle , the susy source of os dileptons is correlated with the dilepton flavor asymmetry , defined as @xmath196 ss dilepton events are expected to have @xmath197 ( replacing @xmath198 with @xmath199 ) , reflecting uncorrelated sources of the leptons ; however , os dileptons may be expected to have a large positive @xmath200 if many of the os dileptons come from _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath201 decay .",
    "the asymmetry is listed in the last column of table vii .",
    "indeed , cases b1 and b2 have large @xmath200 , while a1 and a2 have @xmath200 consistent with zero .",
    "cases b3 and b4 show intermediate values of @xmath200 .",
    "notice that the flavour asymmetry qualitatively tracks the azimuthal angle peaking illustrated in fig .",
    "the same - sign isolated dilepton signature has been recognized@xcite for several years now as a particularly clean signal for susy , owing to tiny sm backgrounds .",
    "it is indicative of the majorana nature of the gluino ; in a gluino pair production event , both gluinos may decay to charginos of the same sign so that subsequent chargino leptonic decay leads to the same - sign dilepton signature .",
    "the cross sections after the cuts discussed above are listed in table iii , under the @xmath202 column .",
    "the sugra cases yield cross sections between 0.4 - 3.7 @xmath160 at the lhc , which would yield 4000 - 37,000 events for an integrated luminosity of @xmath161 @xmath80 per year .",
    "backgrounds are expected to come from @xmath164 production , where a lepton from @xmath0 decay is somehow recorded as isolated and from @xmath203 production .",
    "our simulation of 300k @xmath204 events gives a background of 0.01 @xmath160 , well below signal whereas the corresponding background from same sign @xmath205 production has been shown to be@xcite @xmath206 @xmath160 .",
    "we thus expect that this sample is essentially free of _ physics _ backgrounds .",
    "each lepton in a ss dilepton event usually originates from the cascade decay of different particles produced in the hard scattering subprocess .",
    "thus , the transverse ss dilepton opening angle @xmath207 distribution should be maximal for large opening angles .",
    "this is shown by the @xmath208 distribution plotted in fig .",
    "this behavior , in comparison to that of os dileptons , reflects the source of the dilepton parentage , and hence may be useful in ultimate event reconstruction .",
    "furthermore , if ss and os dileptons had the same source , for instance as in @xmath91 events , then one would expect roughly equal rates for ss and os dilepton production . in table iii , we present the ratio of os / ss event rates , where the same cuts have been made for each topology , _",
    "i.e. _ the @xmath184 cut has been removed for os dileptons .",
    "we see in case a2 , where dileptons come mainly from @xmath3 decay in gluino pair events with @xmath180 , that this is indeed the case . in case a1 ,",
    "leptonic decays of the top and stop daughters of the same gluino are an additional source of os dileptons . in cases b1 and b2 , where os dileptons come frequently come from @xmath201 decay , the os / ss ratio is @xmath209 .",
    "cases b3 and b4 yield intermediate values of this ratio , in agreement with fig . 4 and the flavour asymmetry values in table vii . finally , we show in fig .",
    "5 the fast and slow lepton @xmath185 distributions for ss events . the hardness of these distributions",
    "again reflects the source of the dileptons .",
    "in particular , the slow lepton distribution in os dilepton events is typically softer than the corresponding distribution in ss events .",
    "this is reasonable since there is less energy for multi - leptons produced in the same susy particle cascade decay .",
    "complicated superparticle cascade decays can lead to events with 3 , 4 and even 5 isolated leptons@xcite if gluinos are heavy enough .",
    "these cross sections , after the @xmath149 gev cut , are shown in the @xmath210 and @xmath211 columns of table iii .",
    "we should warn the reader that in our simulation , we have just 10 - 80 trilepton signal events depending on the case in question and just a handful of @xmath211 events . these numbers could , therefore , contain significant statistical fluctuations , and should be viewed in proper perspective .",
    "we see that except in case a2 , @xmath84(@xmath212 trilepton events should be expected in a data sample of 10 @xmath213 at the lhc . however , since gluinos are relatively light within our framework , the @xmath211 cross sections are rather small .",
    "sm backgrounds to these multi - lepton topologies are small : for our simulation of 300k @xmath164 events , no isolated multi - leptons were found , leading to an upper bound on bg from this source of @xmath214 @xmath160",
    ". estimates of backgrounds from @xmath215 and three and four vector boson production also yield rates below the @xmath85 level@xcite .    in the @xmath210 channel , we see a wide range of possible rates for our sugra cases",

    "case a1 , which is similar to a2 except now @xmath93 , can yield substantial @xmath210 and @xmath211 rates in gluino pair events where both tops and stops decay leptonically .",

    "in this paper , we have studied the implications of the simplest supergravity grand unified model ( based on su(5 ) gauge symmetry ) with radiative electroweak symmetry breaking for experiments at the lhc .",
    "this necessarily involves assumptions about physics at the ultra - high energy scale .",
    "our assumptions , which include the minimality of the particle content at and below the gut scale together with the unification of soft - susy breaking parameters at the unification scale , are carefully elucidated in sec .",
    "ii . in the framework of minimal supergravity",
    ", the susy parameters at low energy can all be obtained by renormalization group evolution of just four gut scale parameters together with the top quark yukawa coupling at the unification scale .",
    "we have further restricted the range of these parameters by incorporating constraints from the non - observation of proton decay [ eq .",
    "( 2.3 ) ] and from the requirement that the relic lsp density is compatible with the present age of our universe [ eq . ( 2.4 ) ] .",
    "we have taken at face value the implications of the equality of the @xmath0-quark and @xmath1-lepton yukawa couplings at the unification scale ( allowing for 10% deviations from exact equality due to threshold effects ) which , as has been pointed out by several groups , implies that the top quark mass is close to its fixed point value .      *",
    "the gluino is light , @xmath218 gev ; * the lighter @xmath3-squark is substantially lighter than all other squarks , and further , @xmath90 is lighter than the other squarks ; * the higgsino mass parameter @xmath219 is large , so that the lighter charginos and neutralinos are dominantly gauginos , with masses smaller than about 100 gev ; * @xmath53 is close to unity ; * the lightest scalar in the higgs sector is never significantly heavier than 100 gev .    we have seen that these mass and mixing patterns lead to characteristic features in susy events at hadron supercolliders .",
    "of course , these characteristics can be mimicked by appropriately adjusting the multitude of parameters of the mssm .",
    "the point , however , is that an observation of several of these features could serve as a strong indication of the simplest unification scenario .    despite the various theoretical and experimental constraints that we have imposed",
    ", the parameter space is too large to allow a systematic exploration .",
    "instead , we have identified six sets of model parameters ( that respect all the constraints in sec .",
    "ii ) which , we believe , capture the diversity of signals that may arise within this framework .",
    "the input parameters along with the sparticle masses are summarized in table i. in cases a1 and a2 the gluino decays via @xmath180 , while in cases b , gluinos decay via three body decays .",
    "the main difference between a1 and a2 is in the stop decay patterns : in case a1 , @xmath93 while in case a2 , @xmath220 .",
    "our main results for the signals from the supergravity framework are presented in sec .",
    "v. in order to compare signals from supergravity su(5 ) with those of the usually studied `` minimal models '' , we have also studied the same signals for the four scenarios labelled btw1-btw4 defined in sec .",
    "iv , which have a similar value of @xmath97 as in table i , but have squarks and sleptons exactly degenerate . as usual , we have classified the signals by their leptonic content .",
    "table iii gives an overview of the various signals after all the cuts discussed in sec .",
    "v. we see that there are observable signals in essentially all the channels shown including the @xmath158 and @xmath159 channels which are usually thought to be swamped by sm backgrounds .",
    "unambiguous distinction between all the various supergravity cases , or for that matter , even between sugra and btw cases , is not possible , on the basis of cross sections alone .    in order to facilitate this distinction",
    ", we have listed the characteristics of the @xmath11 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 event samples in tables v , vi and vii , respectively . a major difference between our supergravity cases",
    "a1 , a2 , b3 and b4 , and the btw cases , is that the supergravity events are significantly richer in @xmath20 hadrons .",
    "of course , whether distinction of scenarios based on @xmath20 identification is actually possible will crucially depend on the ability of the detectors to identify displaced vertices . in our calculation , we have assumed a 40% efficiency of identifying central @xmath20 mesons with @xmath221 gev in the central region .",
    "the reason that supergravity events are @xmath20-rich is that one , or more , of the third generation of squarks is significantly lighter than the other squarks . in cases a1 and a2 where the gluinos decay via @xmath222 , each gluino pair event contains at least two @xmath0 quarks from the decays of the top ( in case a1 , the decay of each of the stops also gives @xmath0 s ) . in cases b1-b4 , the enrichment of the @xmath20 sample arises in part because @xmath90 is lighter than the other squarks . as a result , gluino and neutralino decays mediated by a virtual @xmath90 are enhanced .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath81 and @xmath82 are mainly gaugino - like , the z - mediated decays of @xmath82 are strongly suppressed .",
    "then , when squarks are very heavy , contributions from higgs mediated @xmath223 decays , which further enrich the @xmath0 sample , become significant .",
    "finally , in cases b2-b4 , @xmath20 s can also come from @xmath224 decays , although in case b2 , the primary @xmath0 quark is likely to be soft . in cases b3 and b4 , the primary @xmath0 quark and , in all three cases , the @xmath0 quark from top decay should have large efficiency to pass our cuts .",
    "btw type events can be very rich in @xmath20 s if @xmath54 can be produced via cascade decays .",
    "as we have mentioned , this is unimportant for the smaller gluino masses of interest here ( presumably , the kinematic features of the events will give a rough measure of gluino mass ) .",
    "we also see from table v that in cases a1 and a2 , and also in cases b3 and b4 , supergravity events can have very high jet multiplicities  about 10% of the @xmath11 sample has @xmath225 whereas this number is somewhat smaller for the btw cases . for cases",
    "a1 and a2 , this is due mainly to the production of top quarks in gluino decays , which leads to a large jet multiplicity . finally , we see that the flavour asymmetry @xmath200 defined in sec .",
    "v is generally larger in the btw cases than in the sugra cases , except when the gluino is very light .",
    "this asymmetry , which is a measure of the rate for neutralino production in gluino and squark cascades , is greatly reduced when chargino cascades dominate as , for instance , in cases a1 and a2 .",
    "the features of tables v - vii also facilitate some distinction between the various supergravity scenarios .",
    "clearly a1 and a2 are readily distinguishable via the high b - multiplicity in the @xmath11 sample and also from the absence of any flavour asymmetry in the @xmath159 sample .",
    "the ratio of ss to os dilepton production rate in table iii may facilitate further distinction . also , the @xmath20-multiplicity is significantly higher in a1 than in a2 .",
    "the dilepton cross section is considerably higher in case a1 ( where stops can also yield leptons ) than in a2 , while exactly the opposite is true for the @xmath11 signal .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath82 rarely occurs in the a1 and a2 cases , case a2 yields no @xmath210 or @xmath211 cross section , while a1 yields such events only from top and stop decay .",
    "distinction amongst the various cases b is somewhat more subtle .",
    "b1 and b2 are very similar , except for the squark mass , as are b3 and b4 .",
    "a striking difference between ( b1 , b2 ) and ( b3,b4 ) is in the flavour asymmetry , in the os / ss ratio in table iii , in the differential distribution shown in fig . 4 , and especially in the large rate for isolated @xmath210 and @xmath211 events ( as has been explained , these are all measures of @xmath82 production via cascade decays ) .",
    "some distinction may also be possible via the scalar @xmath182 distribution since the parent gluino masses are significantly different .",
    "we should mention that the hard scalar @xmath182 cut tends to wash out this difference ; therefore , this difference may best be studied in the @xmath11 sample _ prior _ to this cut .",
    "this should be possible since the signal is larger than background even before this cut as can be seen from table iv .",
    "the multiplicity of @xmath20 mesons may provide yet another distinction . to distinguish b1 from b2 or b3 from b4",
    "is more difficult .",
    "this is not surprising since essentially the only difference comes from the squark mass .",
    "the clearest distinction appears to be in the cross section for the @xmath158 signal and , in the case of b3 and b4 , also from the @xmath11 cross section .",
    "it is encouraging to see that the various scenarios are distinguishable even in the messy environment of a hadron collider .",
    "the reader may have noticed that even though the @xmath3-squark is light and even though its production constitutes a substantial portion of all susy events ( see table ii ) , we have not extracted any direct signal for its production . in fact , signals for @xmath79-pair production may even be observable at the tevatron in several of the cases discussed in this paper . since our primary purpose here was to study the distinguishability of various scenarios within the su(5 ) supergravity framework from one another and from the so - called `` minimal models '' , we used rather hard cuts to obtain clean event samples .",
    "the direct signals from the lighter sparticles are essentially removed by these cuts and , in our analysis , the existence of the lighter stops and sbottom quarks manifested itself in the decay patterns of the parent gluinos .",
    "it may , of course , well be possible to devise a strategy that is dedicated to look for the light scalar top signal at the lhc .",
    "charginos and neutralinos may also be searched for using specialized strategies@xcite .    in summary , we have examined the phenomenology of the minimal su(5 ) supergravity grand unified model with radiative breaking of electroweak symmetry .",
    "we have delineated the range of parameters allowed by constraints from proton decay and from a cosmologically acceptable lsp .",
    "we have shown that these lead to a characteristic pattern of sparticle masses and mixings .",
    "we have examined signals from the production of supersymmetric particles at the lhc for representative points in the parameter space .",
    "we find that these signals are distinguishable from the corresponding signals within the usually studied models where squarks and sleptons are taken to be degenerate .",
    "we further find that by simultaneously examining various signals it should be possible to distinguish between the various scenarios that are possible even within the restricted framework of supergravity su(5 ) .",
    "discovery of supersymmetric signals at the lhc with patterns corresponding to any of these cases would be extremely dramatic , since it would not only signal the discovery of supersymmetry , but would provide support for the ideas underlying supergravity grand unification .",
