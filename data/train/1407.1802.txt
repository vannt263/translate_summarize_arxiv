    "the interest in the resonance properties of dielectric resonators stems from their scattering properties @xcite , their use as compact resonators or filters in electronic rf circuits @xcite and applications like lasers or sensors of microscopic dimensions in the infrared to optical frequency regime @xcite .",
    "flat microlasers with a large diversity of shapes have been investigated in order to understand the connections between their properties ( e.g. , emission directionality and threshold ) and their shape @xcite . even in two dimensions ,",
    "the helmholtz equation describing the passive resonators can be solved analytically only for a few cases of rotationally symmetric structures @xcite .",
    "hence , generally , numerical methods like the boundary element method @xcite , the finite difference time domain method @xcite , or perturbation theory @xcite are indispensable for their theoretical analysis . cavities with sizes much larger than the wavelength provide an exception since they can be considered as photon billiards , that is , their properties can be related to the classical ray dynamics in the framework of semiclassical approximations @xcite .",
    "such models , though approximate , generally allow for a better understanding of the resonance spectra and field distributions than solely numerical methods and can be extended to size - to - wavelength regimes where numerical computations are no longer feasible .",
    "a phenomenon of particular interest are resonant states exhibiting exceptionally clear structures associated with classical trajectories like periodic orbits ( pos ) .",
    "examples are wave functions that are enhanced around unstable pos , called scars @xcite , or gaussian modes related to stable pos @xcite . furthermore , resonant states concentrated on trajectories with a specific ( angular ) momentum have been observed for oval and square dielectric resonators and circular resonators with rough boundaries @xcite .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that closed polygonal resonators with angles @xmath0 , where @xmath1 are coprime integers and @xmath2 exhibit a pronounced scarring behavior of the wave functions which can be related to families of pos with parallel trajectories and attributed to the strong diffraction at the corners .",
    "similar modes exist in polygonal dielectric resonators @xcite .",
    "resonators with polygonal shape are of importance , e.g. , for filter applications @xcite or because crystalline materials favor the fabrication of polygonal cavities @xcite . cavities with regular polygonal shape have been intensively investigated , and a large number of in many cases similar ray - based models for the resonant modes of equilateral triangles @xcite , squares @xcite , and hexagons @xcite have been proposed .    in this article",
    "we investigate experimentally the structure of the modes of a dielectric square resonator with a microwave experiment .",
    "the cavity is made from a low - loss ceramic material and is large compared to the wavelengths of the microwaves coupled into it .",
    "one advantage of microwave resonators is that the field distributions inside the resonator can be measured directly and the results of these studies can be applied to microcavities since these have a similar ratio between cavity size and wavelength .",
    "furthermore , the dimensions of a macroscopic resonator can be measured with high precision and geometric imperfections that would break the symmetry properties can be excluded .    in the experiments with a square resonator presented here , all observed modes were related to specific classical tori , i.e. , families of orbits that are defined by their common angle of incidence @xcite .",
    "this is surprising because generally only a few modes of a cavity show a structure which can be related to classical trajectories @xcite , like , e.g. , the scars observed in the stadium billiard @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that they can be described by a semiclassical model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite in a unified way and present a detailed comparison of different aspects of the model with the experimental data .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in the experimental setup and in the general theoretical framework for flat dielectric resonators as well as the ray - based model from ref .",
    "@xcite are introduced .",
    "the measured frequency spectra are discussed in . in , the measurement of the field distributions and their analysis is detailed .",
    "section [ sec : expvsmod ] presents an overview over the experimental data and an in - depth comparison with the ray - based model .",
    "the length spectrum and the trace formula for the dielectric square resonator are discussed in , and ends with some concluding remarks .",
    "figure [ fig : setup ] shows a photograph and a sketch of the experimental setup . a ceramic plate made of alumina ( deranox 995 by morgan advanced ceramics with 99.5% al@xmath3o@xmath4 content )",
    "was used as microwave resonator .",
    "the plate was manufactured precisely to be square and to have sharp corners and edges ( the deviation of the angles from @xmath5 is less than @xmath6 ) .",
    "it had a side length of @xmath7 mm and a thickness of @xmath8 mm . in the frequency range of interest",
    "its refractive index was determined as @xmath9 ( see ) .",
    "the plate sat atop a @xmath10 mm thick layer of foam ( rohacell 31ig by evonik industries @xcite ) with refractive index @xmath11 and low absorption such that a free - floating resonator was effectively simulated .",
    "two wire antennas protruding from coaxial cables were coupled to the resonator and aligned perpendicularly to its plane .",
    "a vectorial network analyzer ( vna , model pna n5230a by agilent technologies ) was used to measure the complex transmission amplitude @xmath12 from antenna @xmath13 to antenna @xmath14 .",
    "the excitation antenna @xmath13 was put at different positions either next to a side wall of the resonator or below it [ see left and right part of , respectively ] in order to excite resonances of specific symmetry classes ( see ) .",
    "the receiving antenna @xmath14 could be moved around by a computer controlled positioning unit , allowing to map out the field distributions ( see ) .",
    "it had a configuration as shown in the right panel of , though coming from above instead of from below , with an additional teflon hat in order to reduce the friction with the ceramic plate . before the measured frequency spectra",
    "are discussed in , we will briefly review the general modeling of flat dielectric resonators in the next section .",
    "electromagnetic resonators are described by the well - known vectorial helmholtz equation with appropriate boundary conditions which is difficult to solve for general three - dimensional ( 3d ) resonators .",
    "the dielectric resonator considered in the present article has a cylindrical geometry and is flat , that is , it has a thickness @xmath15 of the order of the wavelength @xmath16 or smaller and a transverse extension much larger than the wavelength .",
    "such resonators can be approximated as two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems @xcite by introducing an effective refractive index @xmath17 . in the framework of this approximation ,",
    "the resonator is considered as an infinite slab waveguide where the phase velocity with respect to the @xmath18 plane [ cf .  ]",
    "is @xmath19 with @xmath20 the speed of light in vacuum and the modes in the resonator can be separated into modes with transverse magnetic ( tm ) and with transverse electric ( te ) polarization having a magnetic field @xmath21 and , respectively , an electric field @xmath22 parallel to the plane of the resonator .",
    "the ansatz for the field component @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) inside the resonator for modes with tm ( te ) polarization is @xmath25 where @xmath26 are constants and @xmath27 is called the wave function ( wf ) in the following .",
    "the @xmath28 component @xmath29 of the wave vector is related to @xmath17 via @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the refractive index of the resonator material and @xmath32 is the wave number that is related to the frequency via @xmath33 .",
    "we only consider modes guided by total internal reflection ( tir ) here .",
    "their fields decay exponentially with @xmath34 above and below the resonator where the decay lengths are @xmath35 here @xmath36 are the refractive indices of the material below and above the resonator , respectively .",
    "matching of the ansatz for the fields inside and outside the resonator yields the quantization condition for the effective refractive index @xcite .",
    "the vectorial helmholtz equation for the resonator thus reduces to the 2d scalar helmholtz equation , @xmath37 for the wf @xmath38 associated with @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) for tm ( te ) modes , where @xmath39 is the component of the wave vector parallel to the plane of the resonator .",
    "the boundary conditions are that @xmath27 is continuous at the boundary of the resonator in the case of both polarizations and that @xmath40 is continuous for tm modes while @xmath41 is continuous for te modes , with @xmath42 the normal vector of the boundary , @xmath43 inside the resonator , and @xmath44 outside",
    ". it should be noted , however , that the @xmath17 approach , even though it turned out to be most suitable for the present considerations , is an approximation which , e.g. , results in small deviations between the predicted and the actual resonance frequencies ( see ) .",
    "furthermore , the behavior of the fields close to the boundary is not well understood since there the approximation resulting from the assumption that the resonator can be regarded as an infinite slab waveguide no longer applies .",
    "the boundary conditions for the field components @xmath23 and @xmath24 are actually coupled at the side walls of the resonator @xcite so there the separation into tm and te modes is only approximate . for the resonator configuration depicted in",
    ", the ansatz for the fields below the resonator needs to be slightly modified due to the presence of the metal table .",
    "this yields the quantization condition @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the @xmath28 quantum number counting the number of field nodes in the @xmath28 direction .",
    "the two phases are @xmath47 and @xmath48 with @xmath49 for tm and @xmath50 for te modes , respectively . here",
    "@xmath11 is the refractive index of the foam and @xmath51 that of air .",
    "the function @xmath52 in @xmath53 is @xmath54 for tm and @xmath55 for te modes , respectively , and accounts for the boundary conditions at the metal table . for a sufficiently short decay length @xmath56 , @xmath57 ,",
    "the influence of the optical table becomes negligible since @xmath58 \\approx 1 $ ] . in the experiments described in the present article , both tm and te modes with different @xmath28 excitations , denoted as tm@xmath59 and te@xmath59 in the following ,",
    "were observed , but the investigations concentrate on the tm@xmath60 modes for which the best data is available .",
    "furthermore , the effective refractive index depends strongly on the frequency . for the tm@xmath60 modes",
    ", @xmath17 takes values between @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the frequency range of interest .",
    "in fact , it was determined experimentally from the measured field distributions , and the theoretical curve for @xmath63 was fitted to the experimental data to obtain the refractive index @xmath31 of the alumina more precisely than provided by the manufacturer ( see ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     the difference between the peak positions of the experimental and semiclassical length spectrum , @xmath64 , are shown in .",
    "they grow linearly with the length of the po , and the solid line is a fit of the form @xmath65 with @xmath66 . the same effect was observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was attributed to the systematic deviations between the measured resonance frequencies and the predictions of the @xmath17 model .",
    "it was shown that @xmath67 is equal to minus the derivative of @xmath68 with respect to the frequency .",
    "this slope equals @xmath69 [ see and ] , which is in good agreement with @xmath67 . from this",
    "we can conclude that the frequency deviations evidenced in are mainly due to the inaccuracy of the @xmath17 approximation and not due to that of the semiclassical model for the dielectric square .",
    "the ratios of the peak amplitudes of the experimental and semiclassical length spectrum , @xmath70 , are depicted in with respect to the angle of incidence of the pos , @xmath71 .",
    "they are in the range of @xmath72@xmath73 and slowly decline with diminishing @xmath71 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and their average value is @xmath74 . given that the semiclassical model and the weyl formula predict a total of about @xmath75 modes in the given frequency range , so only about @xmath76 of all modes are actually observed experimentally , it is not surprising that the experimental peak amplitudes are significantly smaller . since , however , all observed modes are related to trajectories with an angle of incidence above the critical angle ( see ) , it is interesting to compare the experimental length spectrum with the length spectrum for the set of calculated modes that are confined by tir .",
    "it consists of @xmath77 modes , i.e. , @xmath78 of all modes predicted by the model in the considered frequency range .",
    "the corresponding length spectrum is depicted as solid black line in the upper parts of .",
    "it agrees well with the semiclassical length spectrum except for a few peaks like that of the @xmath79 orbit and its harmonics .",
    "this is related to the proximity of the @xmath71 associated with that orbit to the critical angle and the inaccuracy of the stationary phase approximation for such orbits @xcite and not to the lack of the nonconfined modes .",
    "in fact , the length spectrum obtained when including all @xmath75 model modes ( not shown ) can hardly be distinguished from the one accounting only for the confined modes .",
    "this is expected because modes that are not confined contribute very little to the length spectrum since their finite imaginary part of @xmath80 leads to an exponential damping of their contribution [ see ] .",
    "so in practice , it suffices to consider only the confined modes to obtain the length spectrum predicted by the trace formula .",
    "interestingly , the number of measured modes , @xmath81 , is @xmath82 of the number of all confined modes , which is close to the mean ratio between experimental and semiclassical peak amplitudes in . in summary",
    "we demonstrated that the trace formula for the dielectric square resonator is directly connected to our semiclassical model and that the indices @xmath83 of the pos are the conjugated variables of the quantum numbers @xmath84 .",
    "individual modes hence do not contribute to specific pos .",
    "on the other hand , it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that a spectrum containing only one or two families of modes related to trajectories with angle of incidence close to @xmath85 leads to a length spectrum that exhibits only the diamond po .",
    "the experimental length spectrum evidenced that the measured modes , that are all confined by tir , correspond only to pos with this property in agreement with previous studies @xcite .",
    "the qualitative agreement with the prediction deduced from the trace formula was good , and the deviations between the respective peak positions and amplitudes could be well explained with the inaccuracy of the @xmath17 model and the limited number of experimentally observed modes in accordance with refs .  @xcite .",
    "we investigated a dielectric square resonator in a microwave experiment with an alumina cavity .",
    "the spectra and field distributions were measured with various antenna positions on different symmetry axes of the square .",
    "the experimental data were compared with a simple semiclassical model @xcite and showed excellent agreement for an effective refractive index in the range of @xmath86@xmath62 .",
    "the analysis of the momentum space representation of the field distributions proved particularly useful .",
    "first , it enabled a direct measurement of the effective refractive index of the resonator and the refractive index of the alumina .",
    "the measured values of @xmath17 furthermore validated the effective refractive index calculations with high precision .",
    "second , contributions from different waveguide modes , i.e. , @xmath28 excitations in the resonator , could be easily identified and removed within the momentum space representation . this allowed us to obtain field distributions with high data quality in frequency regimes that would be otherwise inaccessible experimentally .",
    "it should be noted that these two aspects apply in general to experiments with flat dielectric microwave resonators .",
    "third , the association of the modes with classical tori in the square resonator was particularly evident in momentum space .",
    "it is presumed that similar phenomena exist also in other dielectric resonators with integrable classical dynamics @xcite .",
    "the ray - based model permitted us to identify the measured resonant states and label them with quantum numbers .",
    "this in turn allowed for a better understanding of the structure of the measured spectra , and it was shown that the modes of the dielectric square are organized in a very regular way akin to that of integrable systems @xcite as also evidenced in ref .",
    "@xcite . only modes associated with trajectories confined by tir",
    "were observed since the resonator was passive .",
    "microlasers , on the other hand , can also exhibit other modes due to their gain .",
    "depending on the symmetry of the excited resonant states , the excitation antenna was placed such that modes of specific symmetry classes were not excited .",
    "we came to the result that modes belonging to nondegenerate symmetry classes exhibit their symmetry regardless of the position of the excitation antenna , whereas for twofold degenerate modes the symmetry of the measured wfs depended strongly on it and could be partially controlled .",
    "this demonstrates the particular sensitivity of highly symmetric resonant structures not only to perturbations of their geometry but also to the manner of excitation .",
    "while the procedures and devices used to pump microlasers differ from those employed to excite microwave resonators , there are nonetheless techniques to influence the excitation of certain lasing modes by changing , e.g. , the shape of the pumped domain @xcite or the wavelength and polarization of the pump beam @xcite .",
    "while the aforementioned methods do not rely on modes with specific symmetries , the use of degenerate mode pairs might enable particularly simple and effective schemes to control the behavior of a laser .",
    "furthermore , the length spectrum was investigated and yielded good qualitative agreement with the trace formula prediction .",
    "in addition it was demonstrated that the trace formula for the dielectric square can be directly derived from the ray - based model .",
    "future projects are the extension of the model to the far - field distributions and a refined model that can also correctly predict the lifetimes of modes confined by tir .",
    "this work was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( dfg ) within the collaborative research center 634 .",
    "here we derive the trace formula for the dielectric square resonator , , starting from the approximate quantization condition . by introducing the variable @xmath87",
    "the dos can be written as @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the solutions of the quantization condition .",
    "hence the function @xmath91 vanishes for @xmath92 and @xmath93 \\ , .\\ ] ] the summation over @xmath94 is rewritten as @xmath95 = \\frac{1}{4 } \\sum \\limits_{m_x , m_y = -\\infty}^\\infty [ \\dots ] + \\ , \\mathrm{additional \\ , terms}\\ ] ] where the additional terms yield contributions due to grazing orbits at the cavity boundaries @xcite .",
    "such higher - order corrections are ignored in the following .",
    "the derivative of @xmath96 is @xmath97 { \\frac{d n}{d e } } \\ , .\\ ] ] the last term is essentially the derivative of the fresnel reflection phase in the case of modes confined by tir .",
    "since the reflection phase does not depend strongly on @xmath98 we neglect this term in the following",
    ". we can now transform @xmath99\\ ] ] by means of the poisson resummation formula to @xmath100 the conjugated variables @xmath101 turn out to be the indices of the pos in the square billiard .",
    "the quantum numbers @xmath94 in the exponential are replaced using and , furthermore , @xmath102 is used where again the derivative of the fresnel coefficients was neglected .",
    "this yields      the integral is calculated by introducing polar coordinates and applying the stationary phase approximation to the azimuthal part .",
    "furthermore , we revert to @xmath104 . the saddle point for @xmath105",
    "gives the area term of the weyl formula @xmath106 .",
    "the remaining terms yield the fluctuating part of the dos in the semiclassical limit ,",

    "<S> furthermore , they allow for a precise determination of the refractive index </S>",
    "<S> . measurements with different arrangements of the emitting and the receiving antennas were performed and their influence on the symmetry properties of the field distributions was investigated in detail , showing that resonances with specific symmetries can be selected purposefully . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the length spectrum deduced from the measured resonance spectra and the trace formula for the dielectric square resonator are discussed in the framework of the semiclassical model . </S>"
