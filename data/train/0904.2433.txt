    "to well understand the properties of charged macromolecules in electric fields , including the conformation and the mobility , is very important in many domains of researches such as in polymer science , in biophysics , and in microfluidics , for the reason of a large variety of applications  @xcite . applying electric fields",
    "stays at the center of the techniques to manipulate charged macromolecules .",
    "it can be also used as a tool to separate molecules by sizes . however , for the latter case , experiments are usually performed in a sieving matrix such as in gel , instead of in a solution  @xcite .",
    "this is because the free draining effect in an electrolyte solution produces an electrophoretic mobility independent of the chain length of macromolecules under a typical electrophoretic condition  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , researchers continue to devote their efforts in finding ways for size separation in free solutions for the reason of its high throughput and applications in microfluidics .    in 2003 , netz proposed a new strategy to achieve this goal by unfolding condensed polyelectrolytes ( pes ) in electric fields  @xcite .",
    "he predicted that the chain mobility increases when a condensed pe chain unfolds in an electric field , and the critical electric field to unfold a chain , @xmath3 , depends on the chain length @xmath4 , following the scaling law @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the chain swelling exponent .",
    "therefore , longer chains will be unfolded and separated out earlier when the applying electric field slowly increases .",
    "his idea has been recently verified by simulations  @xcite in which pe chains were condensed into globules by tetravalent salts and then stretched in electric fields .",
    "a more general form of the scaling law has been proposed in the study , reading as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the ellipsoidal volume calculated from the three eigenvalues of the chain gyration tensor .",
    "according to the scaling law obtained by the simulations , an electric field of 2kv / cm should be applied to unfold collapsed pes of chain length of order @xmath9 .",
    "this electric field is relatively strong .    for practical reason , we wish @xmath3 to be as small as possible .",
    "one way to reduce @xmath3 is to make less compact the condensed chain structure .",
    "this aim can be achieved , for example , by increasing temperature , by performing experiments in high - dielectric solutions , or by using weak condensing agent to collapse pes . in this paper , we choose the last method , using trivalent salt as the condensing agent , and study the static and dynamic properties of chains and the unfolding electric field .",
    "since the electrostatic interaction with trivalent salt is @xmath10 weaker than that with tetravalent salt , some unexpected situations may take place .",
    "a key question is to know if @xmath3 still follow the same scaling law of the strong condensation as shown in netz s",
    "@xcite and in hsiao and wu s study  @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe our model and simulation setup . in section iii , we present our results .",
    "the discussed topics include the degree of unfolding , the critical electric field to unfold a chain , the electrophoretic mobility , the distribution of condensed trivalent counterions on a chain , and the chain conformation after unfolding .",
    "we give our conclusions in section iv .",
    "our simulation system contains a single polyelectrolyte and trivalent salt , placed in a rectangular box with periodic boundary condition .",
    "the polyelectrolyte dissociates into a polyion chain and many counterions .",
    "the polyion is modeled by a bead - spring chain , consisting of @xmath4 beads ; each bead carries a @xmath11 charge where @xmath12 is the elementary charge unit .",
    "the counterions are modeled by spheres ; each carries @xmath13 charge .",
    "the trivalent salt dissociates into trivalent cations ( counterions ) and monovalent anions ( coions ) ; these ions are also modeled by charged spheres .",
    "solvent is treated as a uniform dielectric medium with dielectric constant equal to @xmath14 .",
    "three kinds of interaction are considered : the excluded volume interaction , the coulomb interaction , and the bond connectivity .",
    "the excluded volume interaction is modeled by a purely repulsive lennard - jones potential @xmath15 + \\varepsilon_{lj } & \\mbox{for } r \\leq",
    "2^{1/6 } \\sigma \\\\ 0 & \\mbox{for } r > 2^{1/6 } \\sigma \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the distance between two particles , @xmath17 is the interaction strength , and @xmath18 denotes the diameter of a particle .",
    "we assumed that all the beads and spheres have identical @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we set @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath21 is the temperature .",
    "the coulomb interaction is @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the valences of the two charges and @xmath25 is the bjerrum length , at which two unit charges have the coulomb interaction tantamount to the thermal energy @xmath26 .",
    "we set @xmath27 to be @xmath28 to simulate highly charged pes , such as polystyrene sulfonate .",
    "@xmath29 was calculated by pppm ewald method .",
    "two adjacent beads ( monomers ) on the chain are connected by the bond connectivity , modeled by a finitely extensible nonlinear elastic potential @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the bond length , @xmath32 is the maximum bond extention , and @xmath33 is the spring constant .",
    "we set @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the average bond length under this setup is about @xmath36 .",
    "an external uniform electric field @xmath37 is applied , toward @xmath38 direction .",
    "the equation of motion of a particle is described by the langevin equation : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the mass of the particle @xmath41 , @xmath42 is its position vector , @xmath43 is the friction coefficient , and @xmath44 simulates the random collision by solvent molecules .",
    "@xmath45 has zero mean over time and satisfies the fluctuation - dissipation theorem : @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the kronecker and the dirac delta function , respectively .",
    "the temperature control is incorporated according to this theorem .",
    "we assumed that the particles have the same mass @xmath49 and damping constant @xmath50 .",
    "we set @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the time unit .",
    "we know that the dynamics of polymers in dilute solutions is described by zimm model  @xcite .",
    "however , when an electric field is applied in a typical electrophoretic condition , the hydrodynamic interaction is largely canceled out due to the opposite motions of the ions in the electrolyte solution  @xcite . therefore , in this study we neglected the hydrodynamic interaction .",
    "hydrodynamic interaction is important only when the chain length is very short  @xcite .",
    "we varied the chain length ( or the number of monomer ) from @xmath53 to @xmath54 and studied the static and dynamic properties of pe under the action of an electric field , up to a field strength @xmath55 @xmath56 .",
    "we set the monomer concentration @xmath57 . in order to keep @xmath58 constant",
    ", the size of the simulation box needs to change with @xmath4 . instead of using a cubic simulation box",
    ", we chose a rectangular parallelepiped of @xmath59 , where the box size in the field direction is linearly proportional to @xmath4 to prevent overlap under periodic boundary condition when the chain unfolds .",
    "the added salt concentration was fixed at @xmath60 , the equivalence point @xmath61 .",
    "it has been shown that at this salt concentration , the chain collapsed into a compact globule structure , in the absence of electric field  @xcite , with its effective chain charge almost being neutralized .",
    "we performed langevin dynamics simulations  @xcite with integrating time step equal to @xmath62 .",
    "we ran firstly @xmath9 to @xmath63 time steps to bring the system to a steady state and then ran @xmath64 time steps to cumulate data for analysis . to simplify the notation",
    ", we assign in the following text that @xmath18 , @xmath49 , and @xmath26 are the unit of length , mass , and energy , respectively .",
    "therefore , the concentration will be described in unit of @xmath65 , the strength of electric field in unit of @xmath56 , and so forth .",
    "we start from studying the chain conformation under the action of an electric field .",
    "the degree of unfolding , defined as the ratio of the end - to - end distance @xmath66 of chain over the chain contour length @xmath67 , is used to characterized the conformation .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ f : reolc - e ] as a function of @xmath68 .     as a function of @xmath68 at @xmath69 for different chain length @xmath4 .",
    "the symbol ` x ' denotes the inflection point of curve.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    each curve in the plot denotes the variation of @xmath70 for a given chain length @xmath4 .",
    "we can see that when the electric field is weak , the ratio is a constant .",
    "this indicates an unperturbed conformation of chain and the chain remains in a collapsed structure .",
    "an abrupt increase appears when @xmath68 is increased over some critical value @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath66 can become as large as @xmath71 of @xmath72 if the applied field is very strong .",
    "this indicates a structural transition from a collapsed structure to an elongated structure .",
    "we noticed that the value of @xmath3 depends on the chain length .",
    "the longer the chain length , the smaller the @xmath3 will be",
    ". moreover , this structural transition happens in an interval of @xmath68 .",
    "the size of the interval decreases with increasing chain length .",
    "although the transition becomes sharper when chain length is long , @xmath66 increases in a continuous way with @xmath68 , which suggests a second - order transition .",
    "the dependence of the critical electric field @xmath3 on chain length @xmath4 has been investigated in salt - free  @xcite and in tetravalent salt solutions  @xcite .",
    "both of these studies showed that @xmath3 scales roughly as @xmath73 to unfold a condensed chain .",
    "it is now important to know if this scaling law is valid for a pe chain condensed by trivalent counterions . to verify it ,",
    "we follow firstly the method proposed by netz  @xcite : @xmath3 is calculated by equating the polarization energy @xmath74 and the thermal fluctuation energy @xmath26 . here @xmath75 is the dipole moment of the pe - ion complex induced by the electric field and calculated by @xmath76 where @xmath42 is the position vector , running over all the particles inside the complex , and @xmath77 is the center of mass of the pe .",
    "the complex is considered as a set of particles , including monomers and ions , inside the region of a worm - shaped tube which is the union of the jointed spheres of radius @xmath78 , centered at each monomer center .",
    "the component of @xmath75 at the field direction , @xmath79 , is plotted against the field strength @xmath68 in fig .",

    "the dotted line denotes the equation @xmath80.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    as seen in the log - log plot , @xmath79 increases linearly with @xmath68 with a slope equal to 1 , when @xmath68 is small .",
    "this is the well - known linear response of a dielectric object , @xmath81 , which has been reported in the previous studies  @xcite . but",
    "different to the previous , we found that this linear region terminates before intersecting with the dotted line which denotes the relation @xmath80 , specially when the chain length is long .",
    "this is simply because the binding force to condense the pe chain in the trivalent salt solutions is weaker than in the tetravalent salt  @xcite . for the system studied by netz  @xcite ,",
    "the chains were strongly condensed because of the un - realistically strong coulomb coupling chosen by him .",
    "therefore , his method can be used only as a rough estimation of @xmath3 for the case of strong condensation but not suitable for the weak condensation . if we continue going with his method and",
    "calculate the intersection between the extended linear region and the dotted line , we will find that @xmath3 scales as @xmath82 ( see open circles in fig .  [",
    "f : scale](a ) ) .     vs.  @xmath4 where the open circles denote the data obtained by netz s method and",

    ", scaledwidth=60.0% ]    this scaling law seems to follow the prediction of netz , @xmath84 , because the chain swelling exponent in zero electric field is @xmath85 for this case ( cf .",
    "[ f : scale](b ) ) .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath3 obtained by this method is actually overestimated , going much over away the linear response region , specially when the chain is long .    to give a more accurate estimation of @xmath3 ,",
    "we follow here the definition of the unfolding electric field by taking simply the electric field at the inflection point of the curve @xmath70 vs.  @xmath68 .",
    "the inflection point on each curve in fig .",
    "[ f : reolc - e ] is indicated by the symbol ` x ' .",
    "the scaling law obtained by this method reads as @xmath86 ( see close squares in fig .  [",
    "f : scale](a ) ) .",
    "the exponent @xmath0 is significantly smaller than the one obtained by the netz s method .",
    "therefore , @xmath3 is smaller than netz s prediction for a long chain and it is easier to unfold a pe chain in trivalent salt solutions .",
    "for example , for a chain of length @xmath9 , @xmath3 is @xmath87 according to the scaling law .",
    "this @xmath3 corresponds to about 185 v / cm , much smaller than 2kv / cm predicted for the chains condensed by tetravalent salt in simulations  @xcite .",
    "our results show that the valence of the condensing agent plays an important role in determination of the scaling law .",
    "there must exists more complicated mechanism to polarize and to unfold a pe chain in an electric field than our thinking .",
    "this mechanism will be investigated in detail in the future .",
    "we now study the electrophoretic mobility @xmath88 of pe chain in electric fields of different strength and show how @xmath88 changes with @xmath68 when the chain is unfolded to an elongated structure .",
    "@xmath88 was calculated by @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the velocity of the center of mass of the chain in the field direction .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : mu - e ] .     as a function of @xmath68 for different chain length @xmath4.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    in weak electric fields",
    ", @xmath88 is nearly zero , indicating that the pe chain is effectively charge - neutral , as reported in experiments  @xcite .",
    "while @xmath68 is increased over @xmath3 , @xmath88 turns to be negative and the chain starts to drift opposite the field direction , which suggests a negative effective chain charge .",
    "we found that the stronger the field , the faster the chain will drift .",
    "for a long chain , @xmath88 shows furthermore a plateau region when @xmath91 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath88 on the electric field and the chain length gives a plausible way to electrophoretically separate pe chains by size in free solutions by means of chain unfolding transition  @xcite .",
    "the variation of @xmath88 can be related to the ion condensation on the chain under the action of the electric field .",
    "therefore , we studied here the number of the condensed trivalent ions on the chain by counting the ions inside the worm - shaped tube of radius @xmath78 around the chain .",
    "the results for @xmath92 in different strength of electric field are plotted in fig .",
    "[ f : n3-ipos ] against the monomer index @xmath93 , rescaled from 0 to 1 , where @xmath94 denotes the first monomer heading toward the field direction and @xmath95 denotes the last monomer of the other chain end .     obtained in different field strength .",
    "the value of @xmath68 is indicated near each curve.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    we saw that @xmath96 is flat when the applied field is small , @xmath97 , which shows an uniform distribution of the condensed trivalent ions along the chain .",
    "there is about 0.33 trivalent counterions condensed on each monomer , which indicates the neutralization of the negatively - charged chain backbone by these condensed counterions .",
    "if we further increases the electric field , these condensed ions distribute non - uniformly on the chain where fewer ions condensed near the heading end ( @xmath94 ) than the tailing end ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "when @xmath98 , @xmath96 looks similar to an inclined line and the slope increases with @xmath68 , resulting in a decrease of the total number of the condensed trivalent counterions on the chain .",
    "therefore , @xmath99 increases with @xmath68 due to this partial detachment of the condensed ions by the electric field . at this moment , the pe - ion complex is polarized in a way that the condensed trivalent counterions are bound , basically immobile , on the chain .",
    "for the higher electric field , @xmath100 , @xmath96 becomes a horizontal sigmoidal curve and the value in the middle chain region is independent of @xmath68 .",
    "the appearance of this horizontal region reflects the fact that the condensed trivalent counterions are now gliding on the chain .",
    "these ions can be stripped off the chain by the strong electric field and the other ions in the bulk solution then condense onto it , establishing a steady state .",
    "the total number of the condensed trivalent counterions is approximately a constant in this electric field , which results in the plateau region of @xmath88 against @xmath68 . for an even stronger electric field , such as @xmath55 ,",
    "the baseline of the horizontal sigmoidal curve moves downward .",
    "the condensed trivalent ions are stripped off the chain even more .",
    "the effective chain charge is thus more negative and @xmath101 increases .      in our simulations ,",
    "the pe chains were unfolded , for the most of the time , to an extended structure , similar to a straight line , aligned parallel to the field direction ( see in fig .",
    "[ f : snapshots](a ) ) . nonetheless , we observed sometimes that they were unfolded to a u - shaped structure in the electric fields .",
    "the open side of the u shape can point opposite or toward the chain drifting direction as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : snapshots ] , panel ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "this u - shaped structure has been observed experimentally in electrophoresis of microtubules  @xcite and also been shown in simulations of the elastic uncharged / charged chains in stokes flows or in electric fields  @xcite .",
    "these studies showed that a combination of the elastic and the hydrodynamic effect results in the bending of a rigid chain into a horseshoe shape , oriented perpendicular to the direction of motion  @xcite . if chains are charged and the driving force is an electric field , other effect , the electric polarization of the pe complex , will play a role , which favors parallel orientation to the electric field , and compete with the elasto - hydrodynamic effect  @xcite . in our simulations , the pe chains are flexible and the hydrodynamic interaction is neglected .",
    "therefore , different mechanism drives the chains to form u - shaped structures where the field - induced dipole moments on the two branches of a u - shaped chain establish an equilibrium .",
    "this phenomenon can be seen by plotting in fig .",
    "[ f : n3-ipos_u ] the distribution of the condensed trivalent counterions @xmath96 for the two u - shaped chains from fig .",
    "[ f : snapshots](b ) and ( c ) , respectively .     for the two u - shaped chains in fig .",
    "[ f : snapshots](b ) and ( c ) , respectively.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the symmetry of @xmath96 with respect to the middle point of the chain ( @xmath102 ) shows that an equilibrated polarization was established on the two branches of the u - chain in the electric field .",
    "the existence of two pointing directions of the open side of the u chain is a feature specially for the electric polarization .",
    "it is distinguishable to the elasto - hydrodynamic effect where only the u - shaped structure with the open side opposite to the moving direction is produced .",
    "moreover , we notice that the electrophoretic mobility of an u - shaped chain is approximately equal to that of an elongated chain of half of the chain length . for example",
    ", @xmath88 is @xmath103 in fig .",
    "[ f : snapshots](b ) , close to the mobility of the elongated chain of @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",
    "furthermore , we verified the stability of these u - shaped chains and found that they can persist through the whole simulation period corresponding to , at least , the order of microsecond .",
    "however , by introducing some perturbations such as ac electric fields , the u - shaped structure can be transfered into the elongated chain structure but the inverted direction of transfer can not be realized .",
    "therefore , the u - shaped structure is probably metastable .",
    "we have calculated the total energy of the system for the u - shaped chain structure and also for the extended - chain structure .",
    "we found that the previous energy is , at least , @xmath106 higher than the latter .",
    "moreover , the u - shaped chain has a slower electrophoretic mobility than the extended chain , which implies a larger number of counterions condensed on the u - shaped chain to decrease the effective chain charge ; consequently , fewer ions are presented in the bulk solution and the entropy of the solution is small , compared to the extended - chain structure .",
    "therefore , the free energy of the system is lower for the extended chain than for the u - shaped chain .",
    "this estimation supports that the u - shaped structure is metastable .",
    "since the open side of the u - shaped chain can point to one of the two directions , along or against the field direction , we predict the existence of other metastable states , due to polarization , in which the chain shows many bends , such as s - shaped or w - shaped structures , in electric fields .",
    "we have studied the behavior of single polyelectrolytes condensed by trivalent salt under the action of an uniform electric field by means of langevin dynamics simulations .",
    "we found that the chains unfolded while the strength of the electric field is stronger than some critical value @xmath3 , similar to the previous study where the chains were condensed by tetravalent salt  @xcite .",
    "@xmath3 shows scaling - law dependence on the chain length @xmath4 , reading as @xmath107 .",
    "the exponent in the scaling law is different from the prediction by netz  @xcite and from the simulations in tetravalent salt solutions  @xcite , which demonstrated the importance of the salt valence on the exponent .",
    "therefore , the weaker the condensing agent , the larger the absolute value of the exponent and the easier the unfolding of a condensed chain will be .",
    "we showed that the electrophoretic mobility of chain @xmath108 drastically increases while the chain is unfolded .",
    "the distribution of the condensed counterions on the chain was studied and related to the change of the mobility in different regions of electric field .",
    "the dependence of @xmath88 on the chain length and the electric field enables us to device a way to impart chain - length dependence in free - solution electrophoresis through chain - unfolding mechanism in electric fields . finally , we pointed out the possibility to unfold a condensed pe chain into an u - shaped structure in electric fields , in addition to the elongated structure , with the open side of the u heading or tailing the chain drifting direction .",
    "this structure is a result of purely electric polarization , different from the formation of the horseshoe - shaped chains in sedimentation experiments caused by elasto - hydrodynamics .",
