    "this talk reviews the status of two distinct though related subjects : our understanding of chiral extrapolations , and results for weak matrix elements involving light ( i.e. @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) quarks . the major connection between these subjects is that understanding chiral extrapolations allows us to reduce , or at least estimate , the errors in matrix elements . indeed , in a number of matrix elements , the dominant errors are those due to chiral extrapolation and to the use of the quenched approximation .",
    "i will argue that an understanding of chiral extrapolations gives us a handle on both of these errors .    while understanding errors in detail is a sign of a maturing field , we are ultimately interested in the results for the matrix elements themselves",
    ". the phenomenological implications of these results were emphasized in previous reviews @xcite . here",
    "i only note that it is important to calculate matrix elements for which we know the answer , e.g. @xmath11 and @xmath12 , in order to convince ourselves , and others , that our predictions for unknown matrix elements are reliable .",
    "the reliability of a result for @xmath13 , for example , will be gauged in part by how well we can calculate @xmath14 . and it would be a real coup if we were able to show in detail that qcd indeed explains the @xmath15 rule in @xmath16 decays .",
    "but to me the most interesting part of the enterprise is the possibility of using the lattice results to calculate quantities which allow us to test the standard model . in this category ,",
    "the light - quark matrix element with which we have had the most success is @xmath2 .",
    "the lattice result is already used by phenomenological analyses which attempt to determine the cp violation in the ckm matrix from the experimental number for @xmath17 .",
    "i describe below the latest twists in the saga of the lattice result for @xmath2 .",
    "what we would like to do is extend this success to the raft of @xmath18-parameters which are needed to predict @xmath19 .",
    "there has been some progress this year on the contributions from electromagnetic penguins , but we have made no headway towards calculating strong penguins .",
    "i note parenthetically that another input into the prediction of @xmath19 is the strange quark mass .",
    "the recent work of gupta and bhattacharya @xcite and the fermilab group @xcite suggest a value of @xmath20 considerably smaller than the accepted phenomenological estimates , which will substantially increase the prediction for @xmath19 .    much of the preceding could have been written in 1989 , when i gave the review talk on weak matrix elements @xcite .",
    "how has the field progressed since then ?",
    "i see considerable advances in two areas .",
    "first , the entire field of weak matrix elements involving heavy - light hadrons has blossomed .",
    "1989 was early days in our calculation of the simplest such matrix elements , @xmath13 and @xmath21 . in 1996 a plethora of quantities are being calculated , and the subject deserves its own plenary talk @xcite .",
    "second , while the subject of my talks then and now is similar , there has been enormous progress in understanding and reducing systematic errors .",
    "thus , whereas in 1989 i noted the possibility of using chiral loops to estimate quenching errors , we now have a technology ( quenched chiral perturbation theory  qchpt ) which allows us to make these estimates .",
    "we have learned that the quenched approximation ( qqcd ) is most probably singular in the chiral limit , and there is a growing body of numerical evidence showing this , although the case is not closed .",
    "the reduction in statistical errors has allowed us to go beyond simple linear extrapolations in light quark masses , and thus begin to test the predictions of qchpt .",
    "the increase in computer power has allowed us to study systematically the dependence of matrix elements on the lattice spacing , @xmath4 .",
    "we have learned how to get more reliable estimates using lattice perturbation theory @xcite . and ,",
    "finally , we have begun to use non - perturbative matching of lattice and continuum operators , as discussed here by rossi @xcite .",
    "the body of this talk is divided into two parts . in the first , secs .",
    "[ sec : whychi]-[sec : querr ] , i focus on chiral extrapolations : why we need them , how we calculate their expected form , the evidence for chiral loops , and how we can use them to estimate quenching errors . in the second part , secs .",
    "[ sec : decayc]-[sec : otherme ] , i give an update on results for weak matrix elements .",
    "i discuss @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath2 and a few related @xmath18-parameters .",
    "results for structure functions have been reviewed here by gckeler @xcite .",
    "there has been little progress on semi - leptonic form factors , nor on flavor singlet matrix elements and scattering lengths , since last years talks by simone @xcite and okawa @xcite .",
    "until recently linear chiral extrapolations ( i.e. @xmath22 ) have sufficed for most quantities .",
    "this is no longer true .",
    "this change has come about for two reasons .",
    "first , smaller statistical errors ( and to some extent the use of a larger range of quark masses ) have exposed the inadequacies of linear fits , as already stressed here by gottlieb @xcite .",
    "an example , taken from ref .",
    "@xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ndelta ] .",
    "the range of quark masses is @xmath23 , typical of that in present calculations .",
    "while @xmath24 is adequately fit by a straight line , there is definite , though small , curvature in @xmath25 .",
    "the curves are the result of a fit using qchpt @xcite , to which i return below .",
    "[ fig : ndelta ]    the second demonstration of the failure of linear extrapolations has come from studying the octet baryon mass splittings @xcite .",
    "the new feature here is the consideration of baryons composed of non - degenerate quarks .",
    "i show the results for @xmath26 ( with @xmath27 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigdel ] . if baryons masses were linear functions of @xmath20 and @xmath28 then the data would lie on a horizontal line .",
    "instead the results vary by a factor of four .",
    "this is a glaring deviation from linear behavior , in contrast to the subtle effect shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ndelta ] .",
    "[ fig : sigdel ]    once there is evidence of non - linearity , we need to know the appropriate functional form with which to extrapolate to the chiral limit .",
    "this is where ( q)chpt comes in . in the second example , the prediction is @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the mass of the quenched @xmath31 meson . under study . ]",
    "qchpt also implies that @xmath32 , which is why in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigdel ] i have plotted the data versus @xmath33 .",
    "the good news is that the points do lie approximately on a single curve  which would not be true for a poor choice of y - axis .",
    "the bad news is that the fit to the the @xmath34 term and a constant is not that good .",
    "this example illustrates the benefits which can accrue if one knows the chiral expansion of the quantity under study .",
    "first , the data collapses onto a single curve , allowing an extrapolation to the physical quark masses . and , second",
    ", the theoretical input reduces the length of the extrapolation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigdel ] , for example , to reach the physical point requires an extrapolation by less than a factor of 2 .",
    "this is much smaller than the ratio of the lightest quark mass to the physical value of @xmath35a factor of roughly 8 .",
    "in fact , in the present example , the data are not yet accurate enough to distinguish between the @xmath9 and @xmath36 terms in eq .",
    "[ eq : chptsiglam ] . a global fit of the qchpt prediction to this and other mass differences ( the results of which are shown in the figure ) implies that both types of term are present @xcite .",
    "this brings me to a summary of qchpt . in qcd ,",
    "chiral perturbation theory predicts the form of the chiral expansion for quantities involving one or more light quarks .",
    "the expansion involves terms analytic in @xmath37 and the external momenta , and non - analytic terms due to pion loops .",
    "the analytic terms are restricted in form , though not in magnitude , by chiral symmetry , while the non - analytic terms are completely predicted given the analytic terms .",
    "the same type of expansions can be developed in quenched qcd using qchpt .",
    "the method was worked out in refs .",
    "@xcite , with the theoretically best motivated formulation being that of bernard and golterman @xcite .",
    "their method gives a precise meaning to the quark - flow diagrams which i use below .",
    "they have extended it also to partially quenched theories ( those having both valence and sea quarks but with different masses ) @xcite .",
    "results are available for pion properties and the condensate @xcite , @xmath2 and related matrix elements @xcite , @xmath21 , @xmath38 and the isgur - wise function @xcite , baryon masses @xcite , and scattering lengths @xcite .",
    "i will not describe technical details , but rather focus on the aims and major conclusions of the approach . for a more technical review see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as i see it , the major aims of qchpt are these .",
    "+ @xmath39 to predict the form of the chiral expansion , which can then be used to fit and extrapolate the data .",
    "this was the approach taken above for the baryon masses .",
    "+ @xmath39 to estimate the size of the quenching error by comparing the contribution of the pion loops in qcd and qqcd , using the coefficients of the chiral fits in qcd ( from phenomenology ) and in qqcd ( from a fit to the lattice data ) .",
    "i return to such estimates in sec .",
    "[ sec : querr ] .",
    "i begin by describing the form of the chiral expansions , and in particular how they are affected by quenching .",
    "the largest changes are to the non - analytic terms , i.e. those due to pion loops .",
    "there are two distinct effects",
    ". + ( 1 ) quenching removes loops which , at the underlying quark level , require an internal loop .",
    "this is illustrated for baryon masses in fig .",
    "[ fig : quarkloops ] . diagrams of types ( a ) and ( b ) contribute in qcd , but only type ( b ) occurs in qqcd .",
    "these loops give rise to @xmath40 terms in the chiral expansions .",
    "thus for baryon masses , quenching only changes the coefficient of these terms .",
    "in other quantities , e.g. @xmath14 , they are removed entirely .",
    "+ ( 2 ) quenching introduces artifacts due to @xmath0 loops  as in fig .",
    "[ fig : quarkloops](c ) .",
    "these are chiral loops because the @xmath0 remains light in qqcd .",
    "their strength is determined by the size of the `` hairpin '' vertex , and is parameterized by @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : chevidence ] below ) .",
    "[ fig : quarkloops ]    the first effect of quenching is of greater practical importance , and dominates most estimates of quenching errors .",
    "it does not change the form of the chiral expansion , only the size of the terms .",
    "the second effect leads to new terms in the chiral expansion , some of which are singular in the chiral limit .",
    "if these terms are large , then one can be sure that quenching errors are large .",
    "one wants to work at large enough quark mass so that these new terms are numerically small . in practice",
    "this means keeping @xmath37 above about @xmath43 .",
    "i illustrate these general comments using the results of labrenz and i for baryon masses @xcite .",
    "the form of the chiral expansion in qcd is terms in both qcd and qqcd , the coefficients of which have not yet been calculated in qqcd . for the limited range of quark masses used in simulations ,",
    "i expect that these terms can be adequately represented by the @xmath44 terms , whose coefficients are unknown parameters . ]",
    "@xmath45 with @xmath46 predicted in terms of @xmath47 and @xmath14 . in qqcd",
    "@xmath48 the first line has the same form as in qcd , although the constants multiplying the analytic terms in the two theories are unrelated .",
    "@xmath49 is predicted to be non - vanishing , though different from @xmath46 .",
    "the second line is the contribution of @xmath0 loops and is a quenched artifact .",
    "note that it is the dominant correction in the chiral limit .    in order to test qchpt in more detail ,",
    "i have attempted to fit the expressions outlined above to the octet and decuplet baryon masses from ref .",
    "there are 48 masses , to be fit in terms of 19 underlying parameters : the octet and decuplet masses in the chiral limit , 3 constants of the form @xmath50 , 6 of the form @xmath51 , 6 pion - nucleon couplings , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "i have found a reasonable description of the data with @xmath52 , but the errors are too large to pin down the values of all the constants @xcite .",
    "examples of the fit are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ndelta ] and [ fig : sigdel ] .",
    "[ fig : mnchfit ]    although this is a first , rather crude , attempt at such a fit , several important lessons emerge .",
    "+ ( 1 ) for present quark masses , one needs several terms in the chiral expansion to fit the data .",
    "this in turn requires that one have high statistics results for a number of light quark masses .",
    "+ ( 2 ) one must check that the `` fit '' is not resulting from large cancellations between different orders .",
    "the situation for my fit is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : mnchfit ] , where i show the different contributions to @xmath25 .",
    "note that the relative size of the terms is not determined by @xmath25 , but rather by the fit as a whole .",
    "the most important point is that the @xmath44 terms are considerably smaller than those of @xmath53 up to at least @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath40 terms are part of a different series and need not be smaller than those of @xmath53 . similarly the @xmath55 terms are the leading quenched artifact , and should not be compared to the other terms .",
    "thus the convergence is acceptable for @xmath56 , though it is dubious for the highest mass point .",
    "+ ( 3 ) the artifacts ( in particular the @xmath57 terms ) can lead to unusual behavior at small @xmath55 , as illustrated in the fit to @xmath24 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ndelta ] ) .",
    "+ ( 4 ) since the `` @xmath41-terms '' are artifacts of quenching , and their relative contribution increases as @xmath58 , it makes more sense phenomenologically _ to extrapolate without including them_. in other words , a better estimate of the unquenched value for @xmath24 in the chiral limit can probably be obtained simply using a linear extrapolation in @xmath59 .",
    "this is , however , a complicated issue which needs more thought . + ( 5 )",
    "the output of the fit includes pion - nucleon couplings whose values should be compared to more direct determinations .",
    "+ ( 6 ) finally , the fact that a fit can be found at all gives me confidence to stick my neck out and proceed with the estimates of quenching errors in baryon masses .",
    "it should be noted , however , that a fit involving only analytic terms , including up to @xmath60 , can probably not be ruled out .",
    "what of quantities other than baryon masses ? in sec .",
    "[ subsec : bkchfit ] i discuss fits to @xmath2 , another quantity in which chiral loops survive quenching .",
    "the data is consistent with the non - analytic term predicted by qchpt .",
    "good data also exists for @xmath61 .",
    "it shows curvature , but is consistent with either cubic or quartic terms@xcite .",
    "what do we expect from qchpt ?",
    "in qcd the chiral expansion for @xmath61 has the same form as for baryon masses @xcite .",
    "the qchpt theory calculation has not been done , but it is simple to see that form will be as for baryons , eq .  [ eq : baryqchpt ] , _ except that @xmath62_. thus an @xmath40 term is entirely a quenched artifact  and a potential window on @xmath42 .",
    "what of quantities involving pions , for which there is very good data ?",
    "for the most part , quenching simply removes the non - analytic terms of qcd and replaces them with artifacts proportional to @xmath41 .",
    "the search for these is the subject of the next section .",
    "the credibility of qchpt rests in part on the observation of the singularities predicted in the chiral limit .",
    "if such quenched artifacts are present , then we need to study them if only to know at what quark masses to work in order to avoid them ! what follows in this section is an update of the 1994 review of gupta @xcite .",
    "the most direct way of measuring @xmath41 is from the @xmath0 correlator . if the quarks are degenerate , then the part of the quenched chiral lagrangian bilinear in the @xmath0 is @xcite @xmath63 @xmath41 is defined by @xmath64 . in qqcd the terms in the second line must be treated as vertices , and can not be iterated .",
    "they contribute to the disconnected part of the @xmath0 correlator , whereas the first line determines the connected part .",
    "thus the @xmath0 is degenerate with the pion , but has additional vertices . to study this ,",
    "various groups have looked at the ratio of the disconnected to connected parts , at @xmath65 , whose predicted form at long times is @xmath66 i collect the results in table [ tab : etapres ] , converting @xmath67 into @xmath41 using @xmath4 determined from @xmath68 .",
    ".results from the quenched @xmath0 two point function .",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath70 denote wilson and staggered fermions . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     thus favoring the linear fit , but by a much smaller difference than last year .",
    "if one uses only the first four points then linear and quadratic fits are equally good . what has changed since last year",
    "is that the new point at @xmath71 lies above the straight line passing through the next four points .",
    "[ fig : jlqcdbk ]    jlqcd have also checked the theoretical argument using a simpler method of operator enumeration@xcite .",
    "the conclusion is that there can not be @xmath72 corrections to @xmath2 , because there are no operators available with which one could remove these corrections .",
    "thus jlqcd use quadratic extrapolation and quote ( for degenerate quarks ) @xmath73 where the first error is statistical , the second due to truncation of perturbation theory .",
    "this new result agrees with that from 1993 ( indeed , the results are consistent at each @xmath74 ) , but has much smaller errors . to give an indication of how far things have come , compare our 1993 result at @xmath75 with landau - gauge operators , @xmath76 @xcite , to the corresponding jlqcd result @xmath77 .",
    "the perturbative error in @xmath2 arises from truncating the matching of lattice and continuum operators to one - loop order .",
    "the use of two different lattice operators allows one to estimate this error without resort to guesswork about the higher order terms in the perturbative expansion .",
    "the difference between the results from the two operators is of @xmath78 $ ] , and thus should remain finite in the continuum limit .",
    "this is what is observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : jlqcdbk ] .",
    "i will take eq .",
    "[ eq : jlqcdbk ] as the best estimate of @xmath2 in qqcd .",
    "the errors are so much smaller than those in previous staggered results and in the results with wilson fermions discussed below , that the global average is not significantly different from the jlqcd number alone .",
    "the saga is not quite over , however , since one should confirm the @xmath79 dependence by running at even smaller lattice spacings .",
    "jlqcd intend to run at @xmath80 .",
    "if the present extrapolation holds up , then it shows how one must beware of keeping only a single term when extrapolating in @xmath4 .      to obtain a result for qcd proper , two steps",
    "remain : the inclusion of dynamical quarks , and the use of @xmath81 .",
    "the osu group has made important progress on the first step @xcite .",
    "previous studies ( summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite ) found that @xmath2 was reduced slightly by sea quarks , although the effect was not statistically significant .",
    "the osu study , by contrast , finds a statistically significant increase in @xmath2 @xmath82 they have improved upon previous work by reducing statistical errors , and by choosing their point at @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) to better match the lattice spacing at @xmath85 ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 ) and @xmath88 ( @xmath89 , @xmath87 ) .",
    "there are systematic errors in this result which have yet to be estimated .",
    "first , the dynamical lattices are chosen to have @xmath90 , and so they are truely unquenched simulations . but @xmath91 is determined by extrapolating in the valence quark mass alone , and is thus a partially quenched result .",
    "this introduces an uncertainty in @xmath20 which feeds into the estimate of the @xmath92 dependence of @xmath2 .",
    "similarly , @xmath4 is determined by a partially quenched extrapolation , resulting in an uncertainty in the matching factors between lattice and continuum operators .",
    "but probably the most important error comes from the possibility of significant @xmath4 dependence in the ratio in eq .",
    "[ eq : bkquerr ] .",
    "the result quoted is for @xmath93gev , at which @xmath4 the discretization error in the quenched @xmath2 is 15% .",
    "it is not inconceivable that , say , @xmath2 in qcd has very little dependence on @xmath4 , in which case the ratio would increase to @xmath94 in the continuum limit .",
    "clearly it is very important to repeat the comparison at a different lattice spacing .    despite these uncertainties ,",
    "i will take the osu result and error as the best estimate of the effect of quenching at @xmath95 .",
    "i am being less conservative than i might be because a small quenching error in @xmath2 is consistent with the expectations of qchpt .",
    "a more conservative estimate for the ratio would be @xmath96 .      what remains is to extrapolate from @xmath97 to @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "this appears difficult because it requires dynamical quarks with very small masses .",
    "this may not be necessary , however , if one uses chpt to guide the extrapolation @xcite .",
    "the point is that the chiral expansion in qcd is @xcite @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath18 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 are unknown constants . at this order @xmath104",
    "can be equally well taken to be @xmath14 or @xmath105 .",
    "equation [ eq : bkchqcd ] is an expansion in @xmath106 , but is valid for all @xmath17 .",
    "the idea is to determine @xmath103 by working at small @xmath17 , and then use the formula to extrapolate to @xmath107 .",
    "this ignores corrections of @xmath108 , and so the errors in the extrapolation are likely to be @xmath109 .",
    "notice that @xmath28 does not enter into eq .",
    "[ eq : bkchqcd ] .",
    "thus one can get away with a simulation using only two different dynamical quark masses , e.g. setting @xmath110 , while holding @xmath111 . to date , no such calculation has been done . to make an estimate i use the chiral log alone , i.e. set @xmath112 , yielding @xmath113 the range comes from using @xmath114 and @xmath105 , and varying the scale in the logarithm from @xmath115gev . since the chiral log comes mainly from kaon and @xmath116 loops @xcite",
    ", i prefer @xmath117 , which leads to @xmath118 for the ratio .",
    "to be conservative i take @xmath119 , and assume that the generous error is large enough to include also the error in the estimate of the effect of unquenching .",
    "this leads to a final estimate of @xmath120 where the first error is that in the quenched value , the second that in the estimate of unquenching and using non - degenerate quarks . taking the more conservative estimate of the unquenching error ( 15% ) , and adding it in quadrature with the ( 5% ) estimate of the error in accounting for non - degenerate quarks , increases the second error in eq .",

    "@xcite . using @xmath122 and @xmath123 ,",
    "i find @xmath124 , with the last error increasing to @xmath125 with the more conservative error .",
    "this differs from the result i quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite , because i am here using the 2-loop formula and a continuum choice of @xmath126 .",
    "since @xmath2 can be calculated very accurately , it provides a potential testing ground for ( partially ) quenched chpt .",

    "i note only some highlights .",
    "it turns out that , for @xmath127 , eq . [ eq : bkchqcd ] is valid for all @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "this is why my estimate of the quenching error for @xmath2 with degenerate quarks in table [ tab : querr ] is zero .",
    "thus the first test of ( p)qchpt is to see whether the @xmath128 term is present .",
    "the osu group has the most extensive data as a function of @xmath106 , and indeed observe curvature of the expected sign and magnitude for @xmath129 .",
    "jlqcd also finds reasonable fits to the chiral form , as long as they allow a substantial dependence of @xmath104 on lattice spacing .",
    "they also study other @xmath18 parameters , with similar conclusions",
    ".    not everything works .",
    "jlqcd finds that the volume dependence predicted by the chiral log @xcite is too small to fit their data .",

    "it will be interesting to see how things evolve .",
    "my only comment is that one may need to include @xmath108 terms in the chiral fits .",
    "there has also been considerable progress in the last year in the calculation of @xmath2 using wilson and sw fermions .",
    "the challenge here is to account for the effects of the explicit chiral symmetry breaking in the fermion action .",
    "success with @xmath2 would give one confidence to attempt more complicated calculations .",

    "the methods of choice are clearly ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , as long as they can determine the @xmath137 accurately enough .",
    "in fact , both methods work well : the errors in the non - perturbative results are much smaller than their difference from the one - loop perturbative values . and",
    "both methods find that the matrix element of @xmath144 has the correct chiral behavior , within statistical errors .",
    "what remains to be studied is the uncertainty introduced by the fact that there are gribov copies in landau gauge .",
    "prior experience suggests that this will be a small effect .",
    "it is not yet clear which , if either , of methods ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) is preferable for determining the @xmath137 . as stressed in ref .",

    "all calculations use @xmath145 and the quenched approximation .",
    "the fact that most of the results agree is a significant success , given the variety of methods employed .",
    "it is hard to judge which method gives the smallest errors , because each group uses different ensembles and lattice sizes , and estimates systematic errors differently .",
    "the errors are larger than with staggered fermions mostly because of the errors in the @xmath137 .",
    "[ fig : bkw ]    extrapolating to @xmath95 using the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : bkw ] would give a result with a large uncertainty .",
    "fortunately , jlqcd has found a more accurate approach . instead of @xmath2",
    ", they consider the ratio of the matrix element of @xmath144 to its vacuum saturation approximant .",
    "the latter differs from the denominator of @xmath2 ( eq . [ eq : bkdef ] ) at finite lattice spacing .",
    "the advantage of this choice is that the @xmath137 appear in both the numerator and denominator , leading to smaller statistical errors .",
    "the disadvantage is that the new ratio has the wrong chiral behavior at finite @xmath4 .",
    "it turns out that there is an overall gain , and from their calculations at @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 they find @xmath149 .",
    "this is the result shown at @xmath95 in fig .",
    "[ fig : bkw ] .",
    "it agrees with the staggered result , although it has much larger errors .",
    "nevertheless , it is an important consistency check , and is close to ruling out the use of a linear extrapolation in @xmath4 with staggered fermions .",

    "this year has seen the first detailed tests of the predicted chiral behavior of quenched quantities .",
    "further work along these lines will help us make better extrapolations , and improve our understanding of quenching errors .",
    "it is also a warm - up exercise for the use of chiral perturbation theory in unquenched theories .",
    "i have outlined one such application in sec .",
    "[ subsec : bknondegen ] .",
    "i expect the technique to be of wide utility given the difficulty in simulating light dynamical fermions .    as for matrix elements , there has been substantial progress on @xmath2 .",
    "it appears that we finally know the quenched result , thanks largely to the efforts of jlqcd . at the same time , it is disturbing that the complicated @xmath4 dependence has made it so difficult to remove the last 20% of the errors .",
    "one wonders whether similar complications lie lurking beneath the relatively large errors in other matrix elements .",
    "the improved results for @xmath2 with wilson fermions show that non - perturbative normalization of operators is viable .",
    "my hope is that we can now return to an issue set aside in 1989 : the calculation of @xmath16 amplitudes .",
    "the main stumbling block is the need to subtract lower - dimension operators .",
    "a method exists for staggered fermions , but the errors have so far swamped the signal . with wilson fermions , one needs a non - perturbative method , and the hope is that using quark matrix elements in landau gauge will do the job @xcite .",
    "work is underway with both types of fermion .",
    "given the success of the schrdinger functional method at calculating current renormalizations @xcite , it should be tried also for four fermion operators .",
    "back in 1989 , i also described preliminary work on non - leptonic @xmath154 decays , e.g. @xmath155 .",
    "almost no progress has been made since then , largely because we have been lacking a good model of the decay amplitude for euclidean momenta . a recent proposal by ciuchini _",
    "et al . _ may fill this gap @xcite .",
    "enormous computational resources have been used to calculate matrix elements in ( p)qqcd . to proceed to qcd at anything other than a snail s pace may well require the use of improved actions .",
    "indeed , the large discretization errors in quenched staggered @xmath2 already cry out for improvement . the fact that we know @xmath2 very accurately will provide an excellent benchmark for such calculations . working at smaller values of the cut - off , @xmath156 ,",
    "alleviates some problems while making others worse .",
    "subtraction of lower dimension operators becomes simpler , but the evaluation of mixing with operators of the same dimension becomes more difficult .",
    "it will be very interesting to see how things develop .",
