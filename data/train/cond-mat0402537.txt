    "nucleation phenomena are crucially important in many scientific disciplines , ranging from biochemistry@xcite to earth sciences,@xcite astrophysics,@xcite and cosmology,@xcite and they have been studied by kinetic monte carlo simulations in electrochemistry,@xcite materials science,@xcite magnetism,@xcite and atmospheric science,@xcite to mention just a few . however , many questions in nucleation theory are not yet resolved , and recently there has been much interest in using kinetic ising or lattice - gas systems as theoretical and computational models of nucleation . in particular , over the last decade much work has been done on their dynamical behavior at very low temperatures , both in the computational and mathematical physics communities . while this body of literature is divided between the ising spin and lattice - gas formulations , we here choose to use the more symmetric ising language . however , we remind the reader that the ising spin up and down states correspond to lattice - gas filled and empty sites , and that the magnetic field in the ising model is proportional to a chemical potential in the lattice - gas case .",
    "the explicit mappings are straightforward and can be found in endnote  .    in a typical numerical nucleation experiment ,",
    "the system is prepared in a metastable state with all spins antiparallel to the applied field , and is then allowed to evolve under a stochastic dynamic until the magnetization reaches zero on its way to the stable phase consisting of spins mostly aligned with the field .",
    "in the magnetic ( ferroelectric ) interpretation , this situation corresponds to magnetization ( polarization ) switching in an applied field,@xcite while in the lattice - gas interpretation it would correspond to submonolayer adsorption in the limit that lateral adsorbate diffusion can be ignored.@xcite    at very low temperatures , the dynamical behavior is influenced by the discreteness of the lattice , and it is possible to calculate exactly both the critical droplet ( the saddle - point configuration ) and the most probable path the system follows through configuration space during a nucleation event .",
    "the average nucleation time , defined as the inverse of the nucleation rate per unit system volume , has , for a two - dimensional system evolving under the metropolis dynamic @xcite in the low - temperature limit , been rigorously shown to be@xcite @xmath0 here , @xmath1 is a nonexponential prefactor , @xmath2 is related to the energy barrier separating the metastable state from the stable state , and @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the temperature and @xmath5 is boltzmann s constant ( hereafter set equal to one ) . with this definition ,",
    "@xmath6 is independent of the system size .    in kinetic monte carlo simulations , time",
    "is usually measured in monte carlo steps per site ( mcss ) , corresponding to one attempted update per site in the system . since thermal fluctuations occur in parallel all over the system , this is the measure of monte carlo time that would be proportional to physical time . at the very low temperatures and relatively small system sizes considered here , the average waiting time for a nucleation event is much longer than the time it would take a supercritical droplet to grow to a size comparable to the size of the system . as a result ,",
    "the change of the order parameter from its metastable to its stable value is accomplished by _ one single droplet _  the first one to nucleate after the simulation is started .",
    "since nucleation events can occur independently all over the system , the metastable lifetime in this single - droplet regime , operationally defined as the time until the system magnetization reaches zero and measured in mcss , is inversely proportional to the system volume.@xcite however , the quantity of interest here is the inverse nucleation rate @xmath6 , which is independent of the system size . to remove the volume dependence from the time measurements and obtain data directly applicable to @xmath6 , we therefore here choose to measure simulation times in units of individual monte carlo steps ( mcs ) .",
    "it is in these time units that we shall loosely refer to @xmath6 as `` the metastable lifetime . ''",
    "lifetimes measured in the conventional mcss units can be obtained through division by the number of sites in the system , @xmath7 .",
    "neves and schonmann@xcite have shown that the critical droplet is a rectangle of overturned spins of size @xmath8 with an extra `` knob '' consisting of one overturned spin on one of its long sides . the critical length @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the integer part of @xmath12 . here , @xmath13 is the nearest - neighbor interaction constant of the ising model , which will henceforth be set equal to unity , and @xmath14 is the applied field in the ising model .",
    "the critical length thus changes discontinuously at values of @xmath15 such that @xmath16 is an integer .",
    "it has been commonly assumed that the quantity @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau ] ) equals the height of the energy barrier separating the metastable state from the equilibrium state .",
    "however , we recently showed that @xmath2 actually depends on the specific stochastic dynamic under which the system evolves.@xcite only for certain dynamics , which include the metropolis dynamic used in ref .",
    ", as well as the commonly used standard glauber dynamic,@xcite does @xmath2 actually equal the energy barrier.@xcite for other dynamics that also satisfy detailed balance , and so are perfectly admissible from the point of view of eventually bringing the system to equilibrium , @xmath2 differs from the energy barrier.@xcite    however , neither of the dynamics studied in ref .   contains a microscopic energy barrier against individual spin flips .",
    "since such a barrier is often needed in modeling the dynamics of physical systems , we here consider two specific dynamics that both possess a microscopic barrier .",
    "these are the transition dynamics approximation ( tda ) , introduced by ala - nissila , et al.,@xcite and the commonly used one - step dynamic ( osd).@xcite both can be used in studies of adsorption / desorption and diffusion processes .",
    "formal definitions of these transition rates are given in sec .",

    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the ising lattice - gas model and the different stochastic monte carlo dynamics are introduced in sec .",

    "the extra factor of 4 in the denominator in the latter result would be due to the effect of degenerate configurations with the same energy and the same number of overturned spins that occur for @xmath30.@xcite since we in this paper perform numerical calculations only for @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) , we have not explicitly tested this discrepancy .",
    "results for @xmath33 were obtained in refs .  .",
    "note that @xmath34 is a continuous function of @xmath15 , even though @xmath9 and @xmath35 are discontinuous wherever @xmath28 is an integer .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath2 as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) is simply the energy difference between the metastable state and the critical droplet . in ref .",
    "we showed that there exist stochastic dynamics that satisfy detailed balance , as does the glauber dynamic , but for which @xmath2 is different from the value given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) , even though the critical droplet remains unchanged by the change of dynamic . the specific dynamic for which this was demonstrated was the `` soft glauber dynamic,''@xcite for which the transition rates are given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the changes in the interaction energy and in the field energy , respectively . consequently , the total energy change is @xmath39 .",
    "it is the factorization property into one part that depends only on @xmath37 and another that depends only on @xmath38 that defines this dynamic as  soft.\"@xcite in contrast , the standard glauber dynamic , eq .",
    "( [ eq : g ] ) , which does not have this factorization property , is described as `` hard . ''",
    "the need to use soft dynamics in cases where the ` field ' represents a chemical - potential difference has been recognized in some monte carlo simulations of crystal growth.@xcite    in many applications it is physically reasonable to introduce a microscopic transition barrier.@xcite such a barrier is not part of the ising or lattice - gas hamiltonian , and it is therefore absent in the transition rates discussed above .",
    "rather , the barrier represents a transition state which is inserted between the states allowed in the hamiltonian , such as a saddle point in a corrugation potential for particle diffusion , or a high energy associated with a transitional spin state that is not along one of the two directions allowed by the ising hamiltonian .",
    "dynamics that contain such a barrier are often called arrhenius dynamics , and they can be viewed as a way to use the lattice - gas or ising model to simulate dynamics in an underlying , continuous potential.@xcite here we use the following approximation to express the transition - state energy:@xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the initial and final energies , and @xmath43 is the bare , microscopic energy barrier . in electrochemical applications , such as electron- or ion - transfer reactions , this corresponds to the symmetric butler - volmer approximation.@xcite the construction corresponding to eq .",

    ", we see that the tda dynamic can not be factored into parts that depend only on @xmath37 and @xmath38 and thus is hard . on the other hand , the osd dynamic",
    "can be factored in this way and thus is soft . while these dynamics are often used for diffusion problems ( i.e. , conserved order parameter),@xcite we will here use them in the simpler context of magnetization switching or adsorption / desorption ( i.e. , nonconserved order parameter ) .",
    "like we did in ref .",
    ", in this paper we obtain our results in three different ways .",
    "first , we calculate analytically by hand the first - passage time from the metastable state to an absorbing state just beyond the saddle point in an approximation that the path in configuration space corresponds to a simple one - step markov process.@xcite second , we perform computer - aided analytic calculations using the technique of absorbing markov chains ( amc),@xcite allowing for multiple branching paths and `` blind alleys '' on the way to the absorbing state(s ) .",
    "third , we perform monte carlo simulations using the monte carlo with amc ( mcamc ) technique.@xcite the first method provides the clearest physical insight , and for noninteger values of @xmath28 the results are fully confirmed by the other two .      as we discussed in ref .",
    ", the one - step markov chain for @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) corresponds to the configurations labeled @xmath49 in fig .",
    "[ fig : conf ] .",

    "the differences that we find between the results for the osd and tda rates also indicate that these dynamics are not physically equivalent .",

    "for example , one can utilize the time - dependent quantum density matrix for a hamiltonian coupled to a heat bath , integrate out the heat bath , and with additional approximations usually arrive at a dynamic for a classical or semiclassical system .",
    "this was accomplished for the quantum spin-1/2 system with a fermion heat - bath , giving the ising model with the standard , hard glauber dynamic.@xcite it has recently also been accomplished for a quantum spin-1/2 lattice system coupled to a bosonic heat bath , giving a dynamic that is different from the hard glauber dynamic.@xcite    in this paper we have only studied the effect that changing the dynamic has on the two - dimensional square - lattice ising model .",
    "it is natural to ask how widely such influences on nucleation occur in other models and in other dimensions . at low temperatures , studies",
    "have also been made of the three - dimensional ising model , both through simulations @xcite and through rigorous mathematical analysis.@xcite ( note that the results given for three - dimensional systems in refs .",
    "are not correct for all @xmath15 ; correct results are given in refs .  .",
    ") we expect that both @xmath2 and the prefactor should also change for different dynamics for the cubic - lattice ising model .",
    "in fact , we anticipate that results similar to those presented here may hold for most lattice models with discrete state spaces .",
    "one important question is whether in off - lattice simulations , for example ones that use energy barriers from zero - temperature first - principles calculations,@xcite a change in the dynamic could also change both @xmath2 and the prefactor in low - temperature nucleation .",
    "if this is the case , then , since a small change in @xmath2 can lead to orders - of - magnitude changes in lifetimes , particular attention must be paid to deriving the dynamic to be used in off - lattice simulations .",
    "the results of this study reinforce the message that great caution must be exercised when constructing transition rates for kinetic monte carlo simulations of specific physical systems.@xcite on the other hand , the significant differences between individual dynamics that have been observed indicate that experimental results for such quantities as nucleation rates and interface mobilities should provide valuable input for devising physically sound kinetic monte carlo algorithms in the future .",
