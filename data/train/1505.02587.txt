    "beams of photons and charged particles that carry a _ non  zero _ projection of the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) upon their propagation direction attract considerable attention in both , fundamental and applied research . during the last two decades ,",
    "for example , a large number of experiments have been performed with _ optical _ twisted ( or vortex ) beams @xcite .",
    "moreover , very recently the production and manipulation of the twisted _ electrons _ have become feasible @xcite .",
    "these vortex electrons , whose oam projection may be as high as @xmath0 @xcite , serve today as a valuable tool for probing the structural , electronic and magnetic properties with atomic resolution .",
    "the engineering of the sub ",
    "nanometer sized vortices opens also new possibilities for studying the shell structure and dynamics of individual atoms @xcite .",
    "most applications of twisted electron beams to the study of ( material ) structure rely on the knowledge about the electron _ scattering _ by target atoms or ions .",
    "accurate theoretical description of the basic scattering processes is required , therefore , which properly accounts for the details of the electron ",
    "atom interaction and the vortex structure of the incident beams .",
    "moreover , such a theoretical analysis has to be necessarily performed within the _ relativistic _ framework .",
    "this is due to the fact that the electron vortices are currently produced in transmission electron microscopes @xcite with the typical kinetic energy of 300  kev , corresponding to the velocity of about 80  % of the speed of light .",
    "even much higher energies up to 50  mev are likely to be achieved in an experiment at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility where the twisted electrons , created with the help of conventional holographic mask technique , are to be injected into the linear accelerator @xcite",
    ". the scattering of these mev  beams on solid targets , which will be observed to verify the vortex nature of the accelerated electrons , will proceed in an ultra ",
    "relativistic regime and definitely requires the proper theoretical treatment based on dirac s equation .    despite the definite need for the _ relativistic _ analysis of the twisted electron scattering by atomic targets ,",
    "this field of research has barely started to develop .",
    "up to the present , most of the collision studies with the vortex beams have been performed in the non  relativistic framework @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the twisted electron solutions of the dirac equation have been applied either in free space @xcite or in the presence of strong laser fields @xcite , but not in the scattering kinematics . here",
    "we close this gap and investigate the mott scattering of _ relativistic _ twisted electrons . in our study , we pay special attention to the angular distribution and polarization of the outgoing electrons . in order to calculate these ( angular and polarization ) properties we made use of the first born approximation and the free  particle solutions of the dirac equation .",
    "moreover , we approximated the atomic potential by a sum of yukawa terms ; an approach that is justified for the description of the relativistic electron  atom collisions @xcite .",
    "for such a potential , we evaluated in section [ sec_theory ] the first  born scattering amplitudes for both , initial plane  wave and twisted bessel electrons . with the help of these amplitudes",
    "we were able to derive then the angular distribution and polarization of the outgoing electrons .",
    "for the incident vortex beam , moreover , two experimental scenarios have been considered in which the target is ( i ) just a single well  localized atom , or ( ii ) a macroscopic ensemble of randomly distributed atoms .",
    "the relativistic calculations have been performed for both scenarios as well as for the neutral hydrogen and iron targets , and incident electron energies in the range 10  @xmath1  1000  kev .",
    "these calculations are discussed in section  [ sec_computations ] and clearly indicate that the angular distribution and polarization of the scattered electrons are sensitive not only to the ( ratio of ) transverse and longitudinal linear momenta but also to the projection of the total angular momentum ( tam ) of the incident vortex beam .",
    "even though these results have been obtained within the first born approximation , which has a rather limited accuracy for the description of ( realistic ) electron  atom collisions , they allowed us to elucidate the main effects arising in the relativistic mott scattering of twisted beams .",
    "our study , therefore , can be viewed as a starting point for more elaborate calculations including spin  orbit and spin  spin interactions as well as higher terms of the perturbative expansion .",
    "relativistic units ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) are used throughout the paper .",
