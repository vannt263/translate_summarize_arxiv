    "consider an isochronous hamiltonian system , described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 , with @xmath1 real analytic in @xmath2 and @xmath3 an open subset of @xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding hamilton equation are @xmath5 let @xmath6 be a solution of ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) for @xmath7 . for @xmath8 , in general , there is no quasi - periodic solution to ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) with frequency vector @xmath9 which reduces to @xmath10 as @xmath11 .",
    "however , one can prove that , if @xmath12 is small enough and @xmath9 satisfies some diophantine condition , then there is a ` correction ' @xmath13 , analytic in both @xmath12 and @xmath14 , such that the modified equations @xmath15 admit a quasi - periodic solution with frequency vector @xmath9 which reduces to @xmath10 as @xmath11 .",
    "this is a well known result , called the _ modifying terms theorem _ , or _ translated torus theorem _ , first proved by moser @xcite .",
    "by writing the solution as a power series in @xmath12 ( lindstedt series ) , the existence of an analytic solution means that the series converges .",
    "this is ultimately related to some deep cancellations in the series ; see @xcite for a review .",
    "equations like ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) naturally arise when studying the stability of an elliptic equilibrium point .",
    "for instance , one can think of a mechanical system near a minimum point for the potential energy , where the hamiltonian describing the system looks like @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a real analytic function at least of third order in its arguments , the vector @xmath18 satisfies some diophantine condition , and the factor @xmath12 can be assumed to be obtained after a rescaling of the original coordinates .",
    "indeed , the corresponding hamilton equations , written in action - angle variables , are of the form ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the action - angle variables are singular near the equilibrium , and hence there are problems in the region where one of the actions is much smaller than the others .",
    "thus , it can be worthwhile to work directly in the original cartesian coordinates .",
    "in fact , there has been a lot of interest for kam theory in configuration space , that is , without action - angle variables ; see for instance @xcite .    in the light of moser s theorem of the modifying terms",
    ", one expects that , by writing @xmath19 and taking the ( arbitrary ) unperturbed solution @xmath20 , @xmath21 , there exists a function @xmath22 , analytic both in @xmath12 and @xmath23 , such that by fixing @xmath24 , there exists a quasi - periodic solution to ( [ eq:1.4 ] ) with frequency vector @xmath9 , which reduces to the unperturbed one as @xmath11 .",
    "one can try to write again the solution as a power series in @xmath12 , and study directly the convergence of the series .",
    "in general , when considering the lindstedt series of some kam problem , first of all one identifies the terms of the series which are an obstruction to convergence : such terms are usually called resonances ( or self - energy clusters , by analogy to what happens in quantum field theory ) . crudely speaking ,",
    "the series is given by the sum of infinitely many terms ( finitely many for each perturbation order ) , and each term looks like a product of ` small divisors ' @xmath25 , @xmath26 , times some harmless factors : a resonance is a particular structure in the product which allows a dangerous accumulation of small divisors .",
    "this phenomenon is very easily visualised when each term of the series is graphically represented as a tree graph ( tree _ tout court _ in the following ) , that is , a set of points and lines connecting them in such a way that no loop arises . in terms of trees ,",
    "each line @xmath27 carries a label @xmath28 ( that one call momentum , again inspired by the terminology of quantum field theory ) and with each such line a small divisor @xmath29 is associated : then a resonance becomes a subgraph which is between two lines with the same @xmath30 and hence the same small divisor @xmath31 .",
    "a tree with a chain of resonances represents a term of the series containing a factor @xmath31 to a very large power , and this produces a factorial @xmath32 to some positive power when bounding some terms contributing to the @xmath33-th order in @xmath12 of the lindstedt series , so preventing a proof of convergence .",
    "however , a careful analysis of the resonances shows that there are cancellations to all perturbation orders .",
    "this is what can be proved in the case of the standard anisochronous kam theorem , as first pointed out by eliasson @xcite ; see also @xcite , for a proof which more deeply exploits the similarity with the techniques of quantum field theory .",
    "more precisely the cancellation mechanism works in the following way . given two lines @xmath34 and @xmath35 with the same small divisor , consider all possible resonances which can be inserted between @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    ": when summing together the numerical values corresponding to all such resonances , there are compensations and the sum is in fact much smaller than each summand ( for more details we refer to @xcite ) .    for the isochronous case , already in action - angle variables @xcite , there are some kinds of resonances which do not cancel each other .",
    "nevertheless there are other kinds of resonances for which the gain factor due to the cancellation is more than what needed ( that is , one has a second order instead of a first order cancellation ) .",
    "thus , the hope naturally arises that one can use the extra gain factors to compensate the lack of gain factors for the first kind of resonances , and in fact this happens . indeed , the resonances for which there is no cancellation can not accumulate too much without entailing the presence of as many resonances with the extra gain factors , in such a way that the overall number of gain factors is , in average , one per resonance ( this is essentially the meaning of lemma 5.4 in @xcite ) .",
    "when working in cartesian coordinates , one immediately meets a difficulty .",
    "if one writes down the lowest order resonances , there is no cancellation at all .",
    "this is slightly surprising because a cancellation is expected somewhere : if the resonances do not cancel each other , in principle one can construct chains of arbitrarily many resonances , which produce factorials in the formal power series expansion .",
    "however , we shall show that there are cancellations , as soon as one has at least two resonances .",
    "so , one has the curious phenomenon that resonances which do not cancel each other are allowed , but they can not accumulate too much . moreover , the cancellation mechanism is more involved than in other cases ( including the same problem in action - angle variables ) .",
    "first of all , the resonances are no longer diagonal in the momenta , that is , the lines @xmath34 and @xmath35 considered above can have different momenta @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "second , the cancellation does not operate simply by collecting together all resonances to a given order and then summing the corresponding numerical values .",
    "as we mentioned , in this way no cancellation is produced : to obtain a cancellation one has to consider all possible ways to connect to each other two resonances .",
    "thus , there is a cancellation only if there is a chain of at least two resonances .",
    "what emerges eventually is that working in cartesian coordinates rather complicates the analysis . on the other hand ,",
    "as remarked above , it can be worthwhile to investigate the problem in cartesian coordinates .",
    "moreover , the cancellations are due to remarkable symmetries in the problem , which can be of interest by their own ; in this regard we mention the problem of the reducibility of the skew - product flows with bryuno base @xcite , where the convergence of the corresponding ` lindstedt series ' is also due to some cancellation mechanism and hence , ultimately , to some deep symmetry of the system",
    ".    in this paper we shall assume the _ standard diophantine condition _ on the frequency vector @xmath9 ; see ( [ eq:2.3 ] ) below .",
    "of course one could consider more general diophantine conditions than the standard one ( for instance a bryuno condition @xcite ; see also @xcite for a discussion using the lindstedt series expansion ) .",
    "this would make the analysis slightly more complicate , without shedding further light on the problem .",
    "an important feature of the lindstedt series method is that , from a conceptual point of view , the general strategy is exactly the same independently of the kind of coordinates one uses ( and independently of the fact that the system is a discrete map or a continuous flow ; see @xcite ) .",
    "what is really important for the analysis is the form of the unperturbed solution : the simpler is such a solution , the easier is the analysis .",
    "of course , an essential issue is that the system one wants to study is a perturbation of one which is exactly soluble .",
    "this is certainly true in the case of quasi - integrable hamiltonian systems , but of course the range of applicability is much wider , and includes also non - hamiltonian systems ; see for instance @xcite .",
    "moreover an assumption of this kind is more or less always implicit in whatsoever method one can envisage to deal with small divisor problems of this kind .    in the anisochronous case ,",
    "the cancellations are due to symmetry properties of the model , as first pointed out by eliasson @xcite .",
    "ultimately , the cancellation mechanism for the resonances is deeply related to that assuring the formal solubility of the equations of motions , which in turn is due to a symmetry property , as already shown by poincar @xcite .",
    "subsequently , stressing further the analogy with quantum field theory , bricmont et al",
    ". showed that the cancellations can be interpreted as a consequence of suitable ward identities of the corresponding field theory @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in the isochronous case , in terms of cartesian",
    "coordinates the cancellation mechanism works in a completely different way with respect to action - angle coordinates .",
    "however , as we shall see , the cancellation is still related to underlying symmetry properties : it would be interesting to provide an interpretation of the symmetry properties that we find in terms of some invariance property of the corresponding quantum field model .",
    "consider the ordinary differential equations @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath12 is real parameter ( _ perturbation parameter _ ) , the function @xmath40 is real analytic in @xmath41 and @xmath12 at @xmath42 and at least quadratic in @xmath41 , @xmath43 @xmath44 is a vector of parameters , and the _ frequency vector _ ( or _ rotation vector _ ) @xmath18 satisfies the diophantine condition @xmath45 with @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "here and henceforth @xmath49 denotes the standard scalar product in @xmath4 , and @xmath50 .    the equations ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) naturally arise from equations of the form @xmath51 with @xmath52 analytic and at least quadratic in @xmath41 , after rescaling the coordinates : @xmath53 .",
    "such rescaling makes sense if one wants to study the behaviour of the system near the origin .",
    "we look for quasi - periodic solutions @xmath54 of ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) with frequency vector @xmath9 .",

    "the proof is organised as follows . after introducing the small divisors and proving some simple preliminary properties in section [ sec:3 ]",
    ", we develop in section [ sec:4 ] a graphical representation for the power series of the counterterms and the solution ( tree expansion ) .",
    "in particular we perform a multiscale analysis which allows us to single out the contributions ( self - energy clusters ) which give problems when trying to bound the coefficients of the series . in section [ sec:5 ]",
    "we show that , as far as such contributions are neglected , there is no difficulty in obtaining power - like estimates on the coefficients : these estimates , which are generalisations of the siegel - bryuno bounds holding for anisochronous systems @xcite , would imply the convergence of the series and hence analyticity . in section [ sec:6 ]",
    "we discuss how to deal with the self - energy clusters : in particular we single out the leading part of their contributions ( localised values ) , which are proved in section [ sec:7 ] to satisfy some deep symmetry properties .",
    "finally , in section [ sec:8 ] we show how the symmetry properties can be exploited in order to obtain cancellations involving the localised parts , in such a way that the remaining contributions can still bounded in a summable way .",
    "this will yield the convergence of the full series and hence the analyticity of both the solution and the counterterms .",
    "note that the system dealt with in theorem [ thm:1 ] can be non - hamiltonian . on the other hand",
    "the most general case for a hamiltonian system near a stable equilibrium allows for hamiltonians of the form @xmath80 which lead to the equations @xmath81 also in this case one can consider the modified equations @xmath82 which are not of the form considered in theorem [ thm:1 ] .",

    "the latter property can be seen as a consequence of the cancellation mechanism just described . in a few words  and oversimplifying the strategy  the dressed propagators are obtained starting from a tree expansion where no self - energy clusters are allowed , and then ` inserting arbitrary chains of self - energy clusters ' : this means that each propagator @xmath1023}={{\\mathscr g}}^{[n]}({\\boldsymbol{\\omega}}\\cdot{\\boldsymbol{\\nu}})$ ] is replaced by a dressed propagator @xmath1048 } = { { \\mathscr g}}^{[n ] } + { { \\mathscr g}}^{[n ] } m { { \\mathscr g}}^{[n ] } + { { \\mathscr g}}^{[n ] } m { { \\mathscr g}}^{[n ] } m { { \\mathscr g}}^{[n ] } + \\ldots , \\label{eq : b.3}\\ ] ] where @xmath1049 denotes the insertion of all possible self - energy clusters compatible with the labels of the propagators of the external lines ( @xmath1050 is is the matrix with entries @xmath1051 formally defined in remark [ rmk:4.26 ] ) .",
    "then , formally , one can sum together all possible contributions in ( [ eq : b.3 ] ) , so as to obtain @xmath1048 } = { { \\mathscr g}}^{[n ] } \\left ( { \\mathds{1}}- m { { \\mathscr g}}^{[n ] } \\right)^{-1 } = \\left ( a^{-1 } - b \\right)^{-1 } , \\qquad a:={{\\mathscr g}}^{[n ] } , \\quad b:= m .",
    "\\label{eq : b.4}\\ ] ] for sake of simplicity , let us also identify the self - energy values with their localised parts , so as to replace in ( [ eq : b.3 ] ) , and hence in ( [ eq : b.4 ] ) , @xmath1050 with @xmath1052 , if @xmath649 is the localisation operator .",
    "then , in the notations we are using , the cancellation ( [ eq : b.2 ] ) reads @xmath1053 , which implies @xmath1048 } = a + a b a .",

    "so the values of the trees appearing in the resummed expansion can be bounded as done in section [ sec:5 ] , with the only difference that now , instead of the propagators @xmath625 bounded proportionally to @xmath866 , one has the dressed propagators @xmath1055}$ ] bounded proportionally to @xmath867 .    of course , the argument above should be made more precise .",
    "first of all one should have to take into account also the regularised values of the self - energy clusters .",
    "moreover , the dressed propagators should be defined recursively , by starting from the lower scales : indeed , the dressed propagator of a line on scale @xmath361 is defined in terms of the values of the self - energy clusters on scales @xmath1056 , as in ( [ eq : b.4 ] ) , and the latter in turn are defined in terms of ( dressed ) propagators on scales @xmath1056 , according to ( [ eq:4.13 ] ) . as a consequence , the cancellation mechanism becomes more involved because the propagators are no longer of the form ( [ eq : b.1 ] ) ; in particular the symmetry properties of the self - energy values should be proved inductively on the scale label . in conclusion , really proceeding by following the strategy outlined above requires some work ( essentially the same amount as performed in this paper ) .",
    "we do not push forward the analysis , which in principle could be worked out by reasoning as done in the papers quoted above ."

    "<S> the kam theorem for analytic quasi - integrable anisochronous hamiltonian systems yields that the perturbation expansion ( lindstedt series ) for any quasi - periodic solution with diophantine frequency vector converges . </S>",
    "<S> if one studies the lindstedt series by following a perturbation theory approach , one finds that convergence is ultimately related to the presence of cancellations between contributions of the same perturbation order . in turn , this is due to symmetries in the problem . </S>",
    "<S> such symmetries are easily visualised in action - angle coordinates , where kam theorem is usually formulated , by exploiting the analogy between lindstedt series and perturbation expansions in quantum field theory and , in particular , the possibility of expressing the solutions in terms of tree graphs , which are the analogue of feynman diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> if the unperturbed system is isochronous , moser s modifying terms theorem ensures that an analytic quasi - periodic solution with the same diophantine frequency vector as the unperturbed hamiltonian exists for the system obtained by adding a suitable constant ( counterterm ) to the vector field . </S>",
    "<S> also in this case , one can follow the alternative approach of studying the perturbation expansion for both the solution and the counterterm , and again convergence of the two series is obtained as a consequence of deep cancellations between contributions of the same order . in this paper , we revisit moser s theorem , by studying the perturbation expansion one obtains by working in cartesian coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the symmetries giving rise to the cancellations which makes possible the convergence of the series . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the cancellation mechanism works in a completely different way in cartesian coordinates , and the interpretation of the underlying symmetries in terms of tree graphs is much more subtle than in the case of action - angle coordinates . </S>"
