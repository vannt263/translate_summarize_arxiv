    "the existence of the top quark has been established in march 1995 by the cdf and d collaborations at the tevatron collider .",
    "top quark has been discovered in the strong pair production mode .",
    "the cross section of electroweak process of single top quark was found to be comparable with the qcd pair top production@xcite .",
    "single top production mechanism is the independent way of a confirmation of the top quark existence and straightforward key to measure the @xmath1 ckm matrix element and to study the @xmath2 vertex .",
    "since the mass of the top quark is very large compared to all other quarks one might expect some deviations from the standard model ( sm ) predictions in the top quark interactions @xcite .",
    "the single top quark production rate is directly proportional to the @xmath2 coupling and therefore it is a promising place to look for deviations from the sm .",
    "however one should stress that the task of background reduction is much more serious and important problem in the case of the single top comparing to the @xmath3-pair production .",
    "it happens because the jet multiplicity of single top quark events is typically less than for @xmath3-pair production and so qcd @xmath4 and multijet backgrounds are much higher , and the problem of the single top signal extraction is more involved .",
    "that is why the detail background study is especially needed in order to find an optimal strategy to search for of single top quark .",
    "top quark decays into a @xmath5-boson and a @xmath6  quark with the almost 100% branching ratio in the framework of the standard model .",
    "we consider here the subsequent leptonic decays of the @xmath5-boson to a electron ( muon ) and neutrino , as this signal has much less background and should be easier to find experimentally than channels with hadronic decay of the @xmath5  boson .",
    "in order to study a possibility of the signal extraction from the background we have created the mc generator for complete set of the single top production and backgrounds processes .",
    "generator was designed as a new external user process for the pythia  5.7/jetset  7.4 package  @xcite .",
    "this generator is related to pythia  5.7 by a special interface and uses fortran codes of squared matrix elements produced by the package comphep  @xcite . for integration over the phase space and a consequent event simulation the monte - carlo generator uses the kinematics with a proper smoothing of singular variables @xcite from the comphep and the integrator package bases / spring  @xcite .",
    "the effects of the final state radiation , hadronization and string jet fragmentation ( by means of jetset  7.4 ) have also been taken into account .",
    "the following resolutions have been used for the jet and electron energy smearing : @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in our analysis",
    "we used the cone algorithm for the jet reconstruction with the cone size @xmath9 .",
    "the minimum @xmath10 threshold for a cell to be considered as a jet initiator has been chosen 5  gev while the one of summed @xmath10 for a collection of cells to be accepted as a jet has been chosen 10  gev .    for all calculations cteq3 m parton distribution has been used . for the top - quark production we chose the qcd @xmath11 scale equal to the top mass squared , while for @xmath4 background @xmath12 have been taken . for calculations of @xmath13 and @xmath14 processes we chose the invariant @xmath15 mass for the @xmath11 scale .    under the assumptions mentioned above the kinematic features of both signatures for signal and background have been studied .",
    "we concentrated on the following set of processes at tevatron @xmath16 and lhc @xmath17 colliders leading to the single top quark production : + 1 .",
    "@xmath18 , + 2 .",
    "@xmath19 , + 3 .",
    "@xmath20 , + 4 .",
    "@xmath21 , + where @xmath22 is a light quark and @xmath23 represents the remnants of the proton and antiproton .",
    "basic feynman diagrams for processes mentioned above are shown in fig .",
    "[ diag - st ] .",
    "we refer to the paper @xcite which consider the whole set of feynman diagrams for signal subprocesses .",
    "it is necessary to stress that @xmath24 process contributes only with 5% to the total cross section at the 2 tev upgraded tevatron .",
    "it could be easily omitted at tevatron energies but should be taken into account for the lhc energies since as we shall demonstrate below its contribution at the lhc will be about 30% of the the total cross section of the single top quark production .    for events analysis",
    "we have rescaled the total cross sections of the single top production using the results of the nlo calculations from the papers @xcite(@xmath25=175 gev ) : + for @xmath26=2 tev + @xmath27=@xmath28 pb , @xmath29= @xmath30 pb ; + and for @xmath26=14 tev + @xmath27=@xmath31 pb , @xmath29= @xmath32 pb .    we found lo cross section of @xmath24 equal to 98 pb at the lhc with about 8% uncertainty due to a choice of different structure functions .",
    "the cross section for @xmath33 was calculated using the following way .",
    "the process @xmath34 has been combined ( diagram 3.2 in fig .",
    "[ diag - st]c shows the only one among 8 different topologies contributed to this subprocesses ) with @xmath35 ( diagram 3.1 in fig .",
    "[ diag - st]c ) .",
    "similar to the @xmath5-gluon fusion process the subtraction of gluon splitting term has been made in order to avoid a double counting : + @xmath36    in the previous studies the two above subprocess @xmath37 @xcite and @xmath38 @xcite have been considered separately which being simply added leads to an overestimation and stronger scale dependence of the cross section .",
    "in addition we calculated the complete set of feynman diagrams for @xmath39 subprocesses .",
    "however one should also take into account that the complete set of feynman diagrams for @xmath40 processes includes @xmath41 pair production subprocess .",
    "the @xmath41 pair production is one the background processes included separately into analysis .",
    "therefore its contribution has been removed from the @xmath42 rate .",
    "it can be done in a gauge invariant way by excluding the kinematical region of @xmath43 invariant mass around top quark mass within 3 top decay widths as it was used in case of the @xmath44 collisions @xcite : @xmath45 . for our calculations we used : @xmath46 gev , @xmath47 gev .    as a result , we have 91 pb for @xmath48 process , while @xmath49 process gives additional 7 pb to the total @xmath33 cross section which is therefore expected to be about 98 pb at lhc .",
    "thus the total single top rate is expected to be about 3.5 pb at the upgraded tevatron and 350 pb at the lhc to be compared to the @xmath50 production rate@xcite 7.6 pb and 760 pb respectively .",
    "relative contributions of different subprocesses to the total single top quark production cross section at tevatron are the following : + @xmath51(39% ) , + @xmath52(30% ) , + @xmath53(26% ) , + @xmath24 ( 5% ) .",
    "+ relative contribution of @xmath52 and @xmath24 turn over at lhc : + @xmath51(44.2% ) , + @xmath52(2.8% ) , + @xmath53(25% ) , + @xmath24 ( 28% ) .",
    "as it was mentioned we consider here the leptonic decay modes of @xmath5-boson from the top quark and therefore the final state signature to search for the signal will be : + @xmath54 + where one of the jets is the @xmath6-quark jet from the top - quark decay .",
    "the main backgrounds leading to the same @xmath54 final state signature as the single top signal are the following : @xmath55 ( gluonic , @xmath56 order and electroweak @xmath57 order ) ) , @xmath58 pair top quark production and @xmath59 qcd fake background when one jet imitates the electron .",
    "all numbers for @xmath60 and @xmath59 backgrounds are presented below for the initial general cuts on jets : + @xmath61 , @xmath62 10 gev for tevatron ; + @xmath61 , @xmath62 20 gev for lhc .",
    "total cross section of w+2jets gluonic background is more than 2 orders of magnitude higher than the signal one .",
    "this process includes 32 subprocesses for @xmath63-quarks and gluons in the initial state @xcite , and the total cross section equals to 1240  pb for tevatron and 7500  pb for lhc ( @xmath64- and @xmath65- sea quarks give additional 3% contribution to the total cross section ) .    the specific feature of the single top production is the high energetic @xmath6-jet in final state and one additional @xmath6-jet for @xmath5-gluon and @xmath66 processes .",
    "it is clear that the only chance to extract the signal from such an overwhelming background is the efficient b - quark identification .",
    "we assume 50% of a double b - tagging efficiency hereafter .",
    "however the cross section of the @xmath67 process is so large that even with the requirement of a double b - tagging but due to a b - quark jet misidentification it represents an important part of the total background . in our study",
    "we chose 0.5% misidentification probability which based on the previous mc analysis  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6-quark content of the @xmath67 processes is fairly small  less then 1% .",
    "for the cuts mentioned above the total cross section for @xmath68 process(gluon splitting ) is 8.7 pb for tevatron and 30 pb for lhc .",
    "however , the @xmath69 process is the irreducible part of the total background which has different kinematical properties from the main qcd @xmath67 part , and as will be shown below it depends differently on the cuts .    therefore the @xmath68 background has been considered separately and we have calculated it completely .",
    "complete set of feynman background diagrams for @xmath70 final state is shown in fig .  [ back1 ] for @xmath71 and @xmath72-quarks in the initial state .",
    "the main contribution comes from subprocess ( a ) with the gluon splitting into the @xmath73 quark pair .",
    "diagrams with virtual photon ( c ) contribute only 1% to the total cross section .",
    "contribution from @xmath74 process ( c ) can be suppressed by applying cut on the invariant @xmath15-mass .",
    "lo cross section for @xmath74 is 2.5  pb at tevatron and about 30 pb at lhc . for our analysis",
    "we apply k - factor=1.33 ( 1.55 ) for tevatron(lhc ) to rescale this number for the nlo total cross section@xcite .",
    "cross section of the process ( d ) of higgs production ( we take as an example @xmath75 110 gev ) is even smaller : 0.16 ( 1.8 ) pb ( lo ) at tevatron ( lhc ) , and it means the higgs is really not an important background for the single top .",
    "we apply k - factor=1.25 ( 1.1 ) for tevatron(lhc ) to rescale the results for nlo one@xcite .",
    "diagrams ( b ) give very small contribution due to small value of ckm elements .",
    ".total cross section for @xmath76 process for tevatron and lhc .",
    "the following cuts have been applied at the parton level calculations : @xmath77 , @xmath62 10 gev for tevatron and @xmath61 , @xmath62 20 gev for lhc[tab : jbb ] [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     indeed one can see that for @xmath78  gev cut the difference between exact calculation and the splitting approximation is only about 10 % : 70 nb and 64 nb respectively .",
    "but after @xmath79  gev cut those results differ almost by factor 5 : one has 1.2 and 0.25 nb for exact calculation of @xmath80 and splitting approximation respectively .",
    "the expected difference in the distribution on the momenta transverse of the second jet is illustrated in figure  [ split ] .",
    "the distribution in case of the splitting approximation is significantly softer .",
    "( 600,500)(0,0 )    since we do not apply high @xmath81 cut on jet ( one of them fakes electron , for which we apply 15 gev @xmath81 cut ) the difference between exact calculation and the approximation is of order of 25% for the fake background simulation .",
    "the rate of the signal and backgrounds presented above clearly shows that even after @xmath6-tagging the signal is still more than one order less than the background .",
    "this fact requires a special kinematical analysis in order to find out a strategy how to suppress the background and extract the signal in an optimal way .",
    "-0.8 cm -1.2 cm +    -0.8 cm -1.8 cm +    the distributions for several sensitive kinematical variables for a separation of the signal and the background are shown in fig .",

    "[ st - fig_14 ] for the lhc .",
    "the mentioned above effects of the jet fragmentation , detector resolution and energy smearing are included in the figures . among the kinematical variables for separation of the signal and background the most attractive were found to be :    * @xmath81 of leading jet : + @xmath81 of leading jet distribution for the signal has a peak around @xmath82 , while it is much softer for qcd background at tevatron(fig .",
    "[ st - fig ] ) .",
    "the main difference between kinematical distributions for signal and background at tevatron is that jets from @xmath83 and @xmath84 processes are softer and less central than those for signal with one very hard jet coming from top and another softer jet , accompanying top quark .",
    "for lhc there is no such striking difference in @xmath81 of leading jet distribution between signal and background .",
    "it happens because of higher cm energy and dominating contribution to the background from @xmath41 production ( fig .",
    "[ st - fig_14 ] ) * @xmath85 - invariant mass of the system ( fig .",
    "[ st - fig],[st - fig_14 ] ) : + it is always bigger for signal than those for @xmath4 and @xmath84 backgrounds .",
    "it is important to notice that @xmath41 background peaks at higher values of invariant mass of the system which is clearly seen in the case of lhc , where this background dominates . *",
    "@xmath86 : @xmath5 boson tends to be harder from top - quark decay than from qcd processes .",

    "di - jet mass ( fig .  [ st - fig],[st - fig_14 ] ) : + it is harder for signal than for qcd background , for which @xmath73-pair coming mainly from gluon splitting , in the same time di - jet mass distribution of @xmath41 background has similar shape with the signal .",
    "di - jet mass cut is also used for a reduction of wz background .    in our analysis",
    "we used `` effective '' invariant top quark mass variable which is constructed using the following algorithm .",
    "it is clear that mass of the top quark decaying to lepton , neutrino and b - quark can not be unambiguously reconstructed since z - component of neutrino can not be measured .",
    "one can construct top quark mass @xmath89 using , one of two solutions for @xmath90 of simple quadratic equation @xmath91 our monte carlo analysis shows that if one chooses @xmath90 to be the @xmath92 from two solutions than it will be in about @xmath93 true @xmath90 .",
    "in fact the reason for that is obvious and related to the fact that smaller values of @xmath90 correspond in most cases to smaller values of the total invariant mass @xmath26 . and for the smaller values of @xmath26 the effective parton - parton luminosity is larger and therefore the cross section is higher .",
    "however anyway if the one solution for @xmath90 is used the invariant `` effective '' mass distribution is broader than real invariant top quark mass and one should apply rather wide window for this kinematical variable in order not to lose too much signal events .",

    "<S> we perform a detail theoretical study including decays and jet fragmentation of all the important modes of the single top quark production and all basic background processes at the upgraded tevatron and lhc colliders . </S>",
    "<S> special attention was paid to the complete tree level calculation of the qcd fake background which was not considered in the previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the various kinematical distributions for the signal and backgrounds allowed to work out a set of cuts for an efficient background suppression and extraction of the signal . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that the signal to background ratio after optimized cuts could reach about 0.4 at the tevatron and 1 at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining after cuts rate of the signal at the lhc for the @xmath0 signature is expected to be about 6.1  pb and will be enough to study the single top physics even during the lhc operation at a low luminosity . </S>"
