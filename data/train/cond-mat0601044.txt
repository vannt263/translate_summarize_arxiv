    "a single particle on a one - dimensional , infinite , regular lattice with matrix elements connecting neighboring sites only , as is appropriate in the tight - binding limit , is described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the wannier state localized at the @xmath2-th site , adopting the normalization @xmath3 . denoting the lattice constant by  @xmath4 , its eigenstates @xmath5 are extended bloch waves , labeled by the wave number  @xmath6 .",

    "the probability to find the particle at the @xmath2-th site , when it is bound by the defect , is given by @xmath21 as can be derived with the help of resolvent operator techniques ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .  ) . in the following ,",
    "knowledge of the amplitudes @xmath22 themselves will be required : as shown in the appendix  [ sec : eigen ] , the eigenstate corresponding to the defect energy  ( [ eq : e_0 ] ) reads @xmath23 with @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the normalization constant , and the auxiliary quantities @xmath26 have been introduced .",
    "they obey @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "the fact that the wave function  ( [ eq : psi0 ] ) with the amplitudes  ( [ eq : al ] ) indeed is normalizable for  @xmath29 , and hence describes a localized state , follows immediately from @xmath30 .",
    "if an oscillating electric field is applied to the system , linearly polarized along the direction of the lattice and with amplitude  @xmath31 , the interaction is modeled by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the particle s charge . since the total hamiltonian @xmath34 then is periodic in time , with period @xmath35 , the floquet theorem  @xcite asserts that there is a complete system of wave functions of the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a @xmath38-periodic function .",
    "the quantity @xmath39 is called `` quasienergy '' , in analogy to the quasimomentum in solid state physics .",
    "if there is no defect , the quasienergies for a periodically driven particle in a tight - binding lattice with nearest - neighbor coupling read  @xcite @xmath40 so that the bandwidth is effectively quenched according to the zero - order bessel function @xmath41 : @xmath42 at the zeros of @xmath41 , the band `` collapses '' .",
    "this band collapse manifests itself as dynamical localization of the driven particle  @xcite , an effect which should be observable in far - infrared driven semiconductor superlattices  @xcite .    without periodic",
    "forcing , the strength of a defect of the form  ( [ eq : def ] ) is determined not by the on - site energy  @xmath13 alone , but rather by the ratio @xmath43 : the larger @xmath44 , the shorter is the localization length of the defect state , as witnessed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : loc ] ) .",
    "this leads to the conjecture that in the presence of periodic forcing the defect floquet state again is described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : loc ] ) , but with @xmath43 replaced by @xmath45 , so that the localization length of the defect state should become strongly dependent on the amplitude of the forcing . in particular , when @xmath46 approaches a zero of @xmath41 , the state should be confined entirely to the defect site , if only @xmath47 .    as shown in ref .",
    ", this conjecture indeed is correct in the high - frequency regime , where @xmath48 is significantly larger than the bare band width @xmath9 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : defect ] for a defect with strength @xmath49 : the upper panel shows the occupation probabilities @xmath50 for a defect located at the site @xmath51 in the absence of the periodic force ; the discrete values have been connected by lines to guide the eye .",
    "the lower panel shows the state under the influence of a periodic force with high frequency @xmath52 and scaled amplitude @xmath53 , equal to the first zero of @xmath41 : as expected , the state now is confined almost entirely to the defect site .",
    "hence , the extension of the defect state is governed by the driving force s amplitude .",
    "this effect will be exploited in sec .",
    "[ sec : twodefs ] to control the population transfer between two communicating defects .",
    "in the following , the real amplitudes @xmath22 for the state bound by a single defect placed at a site @xmath54 are normalized such that @xmath55 which implies that the normalization constant @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : al ] ) is now given by @xmath57 this defect state obeys the schrdinger equation @xmath58 next , a second , identical defect is introduced into the left half of the lattice at the site labeled @xmath59 , as described by @xmath60 the two defects then carry two localized states @xmath61 and @xmath62 , obeying the eigenvalue equations @xmath63 by symmetry , good approximations to these two defect states are given by the even and odd linear combinations @xmath64 from these , auxiliary wave functions @xmath65 are defined , which have nonvanishing amplitudes in the right half of the lattice only . forming the scalar product of eq .",

    "@xmath71 . hence , subtracting the above two equations yields @xmath72 it is now stipulated that the localization of the state @xmath73 around the site @xmath54 be sufficiently strong that its amplitudes in the left half of the lattice are negligible .",
    "one then has @xmath74 leading to @xmath75 these telescope series can be summed immediately ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) , resulting in @xmath78 in the same manner , one also derives @xmath79 summing these two equations finally leads to a surprisingly simple expression for the splitting of the energies associated with the two defects : @xmath80 since @xmath81 can be taken as the discrete derivative of the wave function at the site @xmath82 , the energy splitting is determined by the product of the wave function itself and its derivative halfway between the two defects , _",
    "i.e. _ , by the current prevailing there .",
    "thus , this eq .",
    "( [ eq : fin ] ) constitutes a discrete analog of herring s formula , which describes the tunneling splitting for wave functions in double well potentials  @xcite . in view of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : al ] ) and ( [ eq : normerg ] ) , one then has @xmath83 or @xmath84    as with a single defect , the energy eigenvalues are replaced by the corresponding quasienergies in the presence of time - periodic forcing , and the energy splitting turns into a quasienergy splitting . the above result  ( [ eq : relative ] ) , with @xmath10 replaced by @xmath85 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : qeband ] ) , should also be a good approximation to the quasienergy splitting if the driving frequency is sufficiently high .    in order to check this hypothesis ,",
    "the time - dependent schrdinger equation for the periodically forced two - defect system has been solved numerically , and the quasienergies for the localized states have been obtained .",
    "the results for two defects at @xmath86 , with @xmath49 and @xmath52 , are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta ] as functions of the scaled amplitude @xmath46 .",
    "as can be seen , the agreement between the analytical approximation and the exact numerical data becomes excellent when @xmath87 .",
    "it is assumed now that initially , at time @xmath88 , the particle is localized at one of the two defects , and the periodic force is present . denoting the two floquet functions associated with the defects at the given driving amplitude  @xmath31 by @xmath89 , and their quasienergies by @xmath90 ,",
    "the initial state is given by a superposition @xmath91 under the influence of forcing with constant amplitude , this state evolves in time according to @xmath92 where @xmath93 denotes the quasienergy splitting .",
    "hence , the particle is coherently oscillating between the two defects ; the transfer time @xmath94 , after which the particle will be found at the other defect , is given by @xmath95 and thus depends on the driving amplitude  @xmath31 .",
    "when the amplitude changes sufficiently slowly in time , the system responds in an adiabatic manner  @xcite .",
    "hence , under the influence of a slowly varying amplitude  @xmath96 , the initial state  ( [ eq : ini ] ) follows the instantaneous floquet states and evolves into @xmath97 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times     \\exp\\left(-\\frac{{{\\rm i}}}{\\hbar } \\int_0^t \\ ! { { \\rm d}}\\tau \\ ,     \\varepsilon_1^{f(\\tau)}\\right ) \\ ; .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this implies that the transfer time from one defect to the other now is given by the relation @xmath98 which constitutes an immediate analog of the @xmath99-pulse - condition known from two - level systems  @xcite .",
    "this is the physics which will now be exploited for coherent control of population transfer between two communicating defects .    to this end",
    ", the driving amplitude @xmath96 is shaped such that one has @xmath100 for @xmath101 , so that the defect floquet states are confined to their respective sites , and the communication between the two defects is effectively disrupted .",
    "then the amplitude is adiabatically lowered such that the defect states start to overlap significantly , and the particle initially tied to one defect oscillates to the other .",
    "if the amplitude then rises again and reaches the `` collapse '' value @xmath102 at @xmath103 , and is kept constant thereafter , the particle has been transferred to the final state , and will stay there .",
    "the time  @xmath104 is chosen such that @xmath105 to obtain a transfer from one defect to the other , again  @xmath106 has to be chosen .    for a matter - of - principle demonstration of this scenario , one may employ the envelope function @xmath107 for @xmath108 , where @xmath109 quantifies the characteristic time interval during which the amplitude is ramped down and up again , with @xmath110 being understood .",
    "the parameter @xmath111 has been introduced in order to allow for a nonvanishing amplitude at intermediate times , at @xmath112 .",
    "the above considerations rely heavily on the adiabatic principle ; if the parameter variation proceeds too fast , complete population transfer is not achieved .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : versuch ] for a system with defect parameters @xmath113 and @xmath49 , subjected to forcing with frequency @xmath52 and the envelope function  ( [ eq : env ] ) , setting @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 . under these conditions",
    ", the transfer remains incomplete ; slight oscillations visible in the occupation probabilities of the defect sites indicate non - adiabatic dynamics",
    ". however , fig .",
    "[ fig : trans ] demonstrates that the desired result is obtained when the time scales are prolonged : with @xmath117 and @xmath118 , one has practically complete transfer .",
    "it is , of course , also possible to employ the method outlined here to prepare the particle in superpositions of defect states .",
    "for instance , if one chooses @xmath104 such that the phase integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : int ] ) yields @xmath119 , rather than @xmath99 , the resulting state describes a particle which , after initially being localized at a single defect , is eventually found with equal probability on either one . in the same manner",
    ", any desired probability ratio can be obtained ; fig .",
    "[ fig : super ] shows an example where the particle remains with a probability of @xmath120 at the initial defect , and is found with a probability of @xmath121 at the other one , after forcing according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : env ] ) .",
    "it has been shown in this paper that a periodic force can drastically alter the energy splitting associated with the two states bound by two identical defects in a one - dimensional tight - binding lattice . in the presence of the force ,",
    "the band width  @xmath10 entering the energy splitting  ( [ eq : relative ] ) has to be replaced by the effective width  ( [ eq : qeband ] ) , so that the splitting can be monitored within wide ranges , and even be completely suppressed .",
    "thus , the times required for coherent population exchange between the defects can be varied over several orders of magnitude by adjusting the amplitude of the force .",
    "the strategy employed here to give a matter - of - principle illustration of coherent control of population transfer relies on the adiabatic principle , and thus is restricted to forces with slowly varying amplitudes .",
    "it appears possible to overcome this restriction : utilizing techniques developed for the coherent control of molecules  @xcite , it might be possible to design even rapidly changing envelopes which effectuate a guided transport of a particle from one defect to the other , or to create superposition states with well - defined weights .",
    "this might open up new perspectives for the design of quantum logical devices .",
    "i would like to thank m.  holthaus for his continuous support and insightful discussions .",
    "in order to demonstrate that @xmath122 as defined by eqs .",

    "one then obtains @xmath124 singling out the defect site , one has @xmath125 utilizing the explicit expression  ( [ eq : al ] ) for the amplitudes  @xmath126 , this leads to @xmath127 according to the definition  ( [ eq : x_pm ] ) , one has @xmath128 .",
