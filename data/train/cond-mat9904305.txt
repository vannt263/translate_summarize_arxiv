    "it has become increasingly clear that including the circulating supercurrents outside the vortex core in a @xmath0-wave superconductor can lead to a qualitative understanding - in the low magnetic field limit , near @xmath4 - of the effect of a magnetic field * h * on various properties of a superconductor in the vortex state .",
    "the @xmath5 dependence of the specific heat predicted by volovik@xcite and kopnin and volovik@xcite was verified experimentally.@xcite a detailed analysis of the data for * h * oriented perpendicular to the cuo@xmath1 planes including impurity scattering was given by kbert and hirschfeld@xcite ( see also barash _",
    "et al._@xcite ) .",
    "transport properties were considered by kbert and hirschfeld.@xcite subsequently the analysis has been extended by hirschfeld@xcite to include the field * h * in the cuo@xmath1 plane and he demonstrated a four - fold symmetry in the electronic thermal conductivity .",

    "et al._@xcite for the effect of an in - plane magnetic field on the quasiparticle density of states ( qdos ) in a tetragonal two dimensional @xmath0-wave superconductor .",
    "the present work extends this previous study to the orthorhombic @xmath0-wave case and also includes in the calculations the effect of impurity scattering in both , born s and resonant scattering limits .",
    "while most high @xmath6 oxides are tetragonal , yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 ( ybco ) , which is perhaps the most extensively studied of all the oxides , is orthorhombic because its crystal structure includes cuo chains oriented along the @xmath7-axis , as well as two cuo@xmath1 planes per unit cell .",
    "optical measurements reveal that the carrier density in the chains in optimally doped ybco is of the same order of magnitude as it is in the planes and the ratio of the associated @xmath7- to @xmath8-direction plasma frequency is of the order of 2.@xcite similar large in - plane anisotropies are observed in the infrared optical conductivity,@xcite d.c.resistivity,@xcite zero temperature penetration depth,@xcite and thermal conductivity.@xcite    various approaches have been taken to treat band anisotropy including a single tight binding band with different nearest neighbor hopping in @xmath8- and @xmath7-direction,@xcite two band@xcite as well as three band@xcite models which include the single cuo chain layer as well as two cuo@xmath1 plane layers per unit cell with transverse hopping between them .",
    "all these models give the same qualitative features and describe reasonably well the @xmath8-@xmath7 band anisotropy of ybco .",
    "additionally , in an orthorhombic structure the superconducting gap will be a mixture@xcite of dominant @xmath9 symmetry as well as subdominant @xmath10 and @xmath11 symmetric functions because they all belong to the same irreducible representation of the @xmath12 crystal point group .",
    "the simplest approach which contains the physics of the more complex calculations is a single infinite band with distinct effective masses along the @xmath8 @xmath13 and @xmath7 @xmath14 directions@xcite with a @xmath15-symmetric gap function on the cylindrical fermi surface.@xcite for simplicity we will adopt throughout this paper this approach and calculate the effect of an in - plane magnetic field * h * on the qdos assuming a distribution of non overlapping vortex cores and account only for the circulating supercurrents around the vortices .",
    "we will also treat the effect of impurities in both , born s and resonant scattering limits .",
    "impurities were not considered in the previous calculations in tetragonal symmetry by vekhter _",
    "et al._@xcite which were confined to the pure limit .",
    "thus , our results with impurities in the tetragonal case are the first such results .",
    "we begin with a single free electron band in two dimensions with an ellipsoidal fermi surface and the single particle energy @xmath16 in the normal state given by the dispersion relation @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the momentum vector and @xmath20 the fermi energy . in eq .",

    "consistent with the above assumption for the energy band dispersion relation is a mixed @xmath15-symmetric gap on the fermi surface ( an ellipse ) of the form @xmath26 with @xmath27 the gap amplitude . in eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) @xmath28 is a polar angle measured from the @xmath29-axis in the two dimensional copper oxide brillouin zone giving the angle of * k * ( momentum on the fermi surface ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) gives the dominant @xmath0-wave part of the gap which , on its own , would have nodes on the main diagonal at @xmath30 .",
    "the number @xmath31 is a measure of the subdominant @xmath31-wave part .",
    "both parts are allowed to exist in an orthorhombic system such as ybco from group theoretical considerations .",
    "the @xmath31-component moves the nodes from @xmath30 to @xmath32 off the main diagonal of the brillouin zone . for positive values of @xmath31 the critical @xmath28 defining the node is larger than @xmath33 while the opposite holds for negative values of @xmath31 .    in order to work with eqs .",

    "clearly , the electron dispersion relation ( [ e1 ] ) reduces to @xmath38 with @xmath39 the average band mass . applying the same transformation to the gap ( [ e3 ] ) gives the order parameter in the * p*-frame@xcite @xmath40    we show in fig .",

    "this trend is even more pronounced in frame ( c ) where @xmath47 . in this case @xmath42 and @xmath31 add constructively to further increase the positive lobes as compared to the negative ones , and the nodes are shifted to yet larger angles .",

    "the nodes can be made to remain unshifted but the size of the lobes is changed over their @xmath49 values .    in the laboratory frame ( * k * , before transformation ) the thermodynamic green s function takes on the form @xmath50 with @xmath16 and @xmath51 given by eqs .",

    "assuming circular supercurrents , an approximation discussed in the paper by vekhter _",

    "( [ e18 ] ) is dominated by the nodal region and , thus , we get approximately @xmath87 where the @xmath88 are the nodes of the transformed gap ( [ e7 ] ) and @xmath89 is the derivative of this gap function at its nodes",
    ". these can be found at @xmath90 while in the laboratory frame , as we have noted before , the gap has its nodes at @xmath91 .",

    "the dashed line is the exact result ( [ e18 ] ) , the solid line is based on eq .",
    "( [ e24 ] ) .",
    "the agreement is good .",
    "note the two - fold symmetry in the pattern obtained , although , since @xmath44 , the gap in the laboratory frame has pure @xmath0-wave symmetry with nodes on the main diagonal .",
    "it is the band anisotropy that breaks the four - fold symmetry of the tetragonal case .",
    "however , it is very important to realize that because of @xmath102 , _",
    "i.e. _ band orthorhombicity , the sharp kinks in the curve for @xmath93 vs.  @xmath66 no longer fall at the position of the nodes .",
    "this would be the case in a tetragonal system but is not so for the ellipsoidal fermi surface of fig .",

    "this is an important result because it is often believed that the sharp structure in @xmath93 as a function of @xmath66 - the magnetic field orientation - gives the position of the nodes .",

    "the fermi velocity at that point , @xmath107 , points in the direction @xmath108 .",
    "if the magnetic field * h * is placed in that direction the circulating supercurrents will be in a plane perpendicular to the two dimensional brillouin zone and oriented along the tangent to the fermi surface at @xmath109 as shown in the figure by the thick shaded line .",

    "the angle @xmath103 coincides with the position of the nodes in the @xmath15-symmetric gap in the laboratory frame only if @xmath43 .",
    "we can also see from ( [ e27 ] ) that a negative value of the subdominant @xmath31-wave part ( _ i.e. _ a negative value of @xmath31 ) partially compensates for the effect of @xmath42 but does not cancel it out completely .    in fig .",

    "it is clear that the amplitude of the predicted oscillations in the qdos increases considerably with increasing effective mass anisotropy @xmath112 and that consequently this anisotropy will be easier to detect as the orthorhombicity of the band structure increases , _",
    "i.e. _ as @xmath42 increases .",
    "there is nearly a factor of 6 between the value at minimum and at maximum in the dashed - dotted curve .",
    "the pattern of oscillation is also changed as @xmath42 increases .",
    "the intermediate secondary maximum , around @xmath113 in the solid curve , is not present any longer in the dashed - dotted curve .",
    "instead there is a minimum .",
    "a fit to data of the form ( [ e24 ] ) could in principle yield information on the two most important parameters @xmath42 and @xmath31 but the position of the sharp structure in the qdos by itself does not give directly the position of the nodes or the ratio of the subdominant @xmath31-wave admixture to the dominant @xmath0-wave component .",
    "it is the direction of * h * giving no doppler shift which determines the position of the minimum in @xmath93 . before leaving eq .",

    "the anisotropy is now very small and will not be observable in specific heat experiments .",
    "dependencies of @xmath118 vs. @xmath123 are changed only slightly with the introduction of born scattering impurities ; the dotted curve is for @xmath121 and the dashed - dotted one for @xmath168 , and @xmath147 . on the other hand ,",
    "the gray curves for resonant scattering with @xmath151 are very different and are approximately constant at low @xmath123 with little difference between the two directions .",
    "it is obvious that little anisotropy remains in the qdos .",
    "similar results are given in frame ( b ) for the orthorhombic case with @xmath169 , @xmath170 , and @xmath149 , _",
    "i.e. _ the same value of @xmath82 to gap amplitude is used as in frame ( a ) .",
    "the most important difference to be noted is that the critical angle , at which an @xmath123 dependence is found in the clean limit , is at the angle @xmath171 and not at @xmath168 .",
    "also , the anisotropy is not washed out quite as much in the resonant scattering case when compared to the tetragonal case . further in this case at sufficiently high frequencies the two curves for @xmath121 and @xmath171 cross and the curve for @xmath121 falls below the one for @xmath171 thus reversing the pattern of maxima and minima shown in fig .",
    "[ f9 ] for lower values of @xmath123 .",
    "we also note that as @xmath123 increases out of zero the qdos @xmath118 decreases for both @xmath66 values given in frame ( a ) ( tetragonal case ) while for the orthorhombic case in frame ( b ) the reverse is true .",
    "this effect is also seen in figs .",

    "we have calculated the effect of the circulating vortex supercurrents on the qdos of a two dimensional @xmath0-wave superconductor . for the magnetic field * h * placed in the cuo@xmath1 plane the qdos varies as a function of the angle @xmath66 between * h * and the @xmath150-axis .",
    "we have included in our calculations an @xmath8-@xmath7 effective mass anisotropy of about 2 with a view of modeling the band structure of ybco which is orthorhombic because of the existence of cuo chains , and for which the charge carrier oscillator strength on the chains is approximately of the same order as in the cuo@xmath1 planes . in addition , the gap on the fermi surface was assumed to posses a subdominant @xmath31-wave as well as a dominant @xmath0-wave character .",
    "consideration of penetration depth data fixes the value of this admixture so that we have no adjustable parameters .",
    "impurities are also included in our calculations in both , born s and unitary limits .",
    "it is found that the four - fold pattern predicted for the dependence of the zero frequency value of the qdos in a pure tetragonal system is now changed to a two - fold variation due to the orthorhombicity in the gap or in the band structure .",
    "the introduction of impurities leaves the symmetry of the pattern unchanged but can reduce its amplitude .",
    "it is also found that the pattern of variation of @xmath118 with @xmath66 is altered as the frequency is increased , although it remains four - fold for tetragonal systems and two - fold for the orthorhombic case .",
    "an important result is that the angle at which minima occur in @xmath93 vs. @xmath66 does not correspond to the angle at which the zeros occur in the gap as would be the case in a tetragonal system . instead",
    ", the minima occur when the normal state quasiparticle fermi velocity in the nodal direction is perpendicular to the direction of the vortex supercurrents , _",
    "i.e. _ parallel to the direction of the external magnetic field",
    ".    specific heat measurements in clean samples are most favorable for observing the predicted two - fold pattern of anisotropy . to observe it in ybco detwinned samples are best because an average over equal numbers of twins greatly reduces the predicted anisotropy for detwinned samples .",
    "consideration of more realistic tight binding band structure models are in progress .",
    "our very simple effective mass model , however , has allowed us to understand the important changes orthorhombicity brings to the magnetic field orientation dependence of the qdos for a two dimensional cuo@xmath1 plane with * h * in the plane .",
    "it has helped us to determine the experimental conditions most favorable to the observation of the predicted anisotropies .",
