    "<S> in this paper , we propose an edge detection technique based on some local smoothing of the image followed by a statistical hypothesis testing on the gradient . an edge point being defined as a zero - crossing of the laplacian </S>",
    "<S> , it is said to be a significant edge point if the gradient at this point is larger than a threshold @xmath0 defined by : if the image @xmath1 is pure noise , then @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , a significant edge is an edge which has a very low probability to be there because of noise . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that the threshold @xmath0 can be explicitly computed in the case of a stationary gaussian noise . in images we are interested in , which are obtained by tomographic reconstruction from a radiograph , </S>",
    "<S> this method fails since the gaussian noise is not stationary anymore . </S>",
    "<S> but in this case again , we will be able to give the law of the gradient conditionally on the zero - crossing of the laplacian , and thus compute the threshold @xmath0 . </S>",
