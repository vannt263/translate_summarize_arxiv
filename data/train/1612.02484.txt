    "the combined statistical analysis of the most recent measurements coming from jla ( joint light curve analysis ) type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) data @xcite , the growth rate of structure formation obtained from redshift space distortion ( rsd ) data @xcite , the different baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) detected in the galaxy clustering observations ( @xmath8dfgs , sdss dr @xmath9 , sdss dr @xmath10 , sdss dr @xmath11 , boss dr @xmath10 cmass , @xmath12dspcf , @xmath12dmps , boss dr @xmath11 cmass ) , @xcite , the observations of anisotropies in the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb : distance priors ) data from the planck @xmath13 data @xcite , and the hubble parameter ( h ) measurements obtained from galaxy surveys @xcite indicate that the present universe is undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", this phenomenon can be explained introducing in the universe an unknown physical fluid with negative pressure so - called @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "many alternative models have been suggested to explain it ; in particular , the lambda cold dark matter ( @xmath14cdm ) model has a cosmological constant as @xmath2 with an eos parameter @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "however , other more structured models replace @xmath14 by a dynamical @xmath2 such as phantom model @xcite , quinton model @xcite , quintessence model @xcite , k - essence model @xcite , chaplyging gas model @xcite , massive scalar field model @xcite , etc .",
    "+ in the same way , within the universe we also assume the existence of another dark component so - called @xmath1 , which acts exactly like the ordinary matter ( pressureless ) , and can interact with @xmath2 gravitationally .",
    "+ on the other hand , the @xmath14cdm model presents two different problems such as the fine tuning and the cosmic coincidence .",
    "then , one way to solve the last problem within gr is to assume a coupling between @xmath2 fluid and @xmath1 fluid . currently , there are not neither physical arguments nor recent observations to exclude an energy exchange between these dark components because their natures are still unknown @xcite .",
    "+ due to the absence of a fundamental theory to construct @xmath0 , different phenomenological parameterizations for @xmath0 have been proposed by mathematical simplicity @xcite ; for example , @xmath16 @xcite , @xmath17 @xcite , @xmath18 @xcite , @xmath19 @xcite and @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "then such models may be physically viable , if they are confronted with the observational data , and therefore , can be employed in order to look new physical properties on cosmological scales @xcite .",
    "+ on the other hand , the properties of @xmath2 fluid are mainly characterized by the eos parameter @xmath3 . in this case , two possibilities are proposed to explain a varying @xmath3 . the first one is to parameterize @xmath3 in terms of some free - parameters @xcite .",
    "thus , among all the different ansatzes the chevallier - polarski - linder ( cpl ) parameterization @xcite @xmath21 $ ] ( where @xmath22 is the redshift , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are dimensionless parameters ) is considered as the most popular ansatz .",
    "this ansatz shows a divergence problem when redshift @xmath22 approaches to @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the second one is to expand @xmath3 in terms of an appropriated local basis @xcite .",
    "consequently , we are interested in proposing a divergence - free reconstruction for @xmath3 and via a polynomial expansion , it will show new features .",
    "for example , we can expand @xmath3 , in function of the chebyshev polynomials @xmath26 , with @xmath27 .",
    "these polynomials are considered as a complete orthonormal basis on the finite interval @xmath28 $ ] , and belong to the hilbert space @xmath29 of real values @xcite .",
    "likewise , they have the property to be minimal approximately polynomials @xcite , and possess a better advantage in terms of stability .",
    "+ if we compare the theoretical predictions with the observational measurements , we will show the different effects of including the numerical reconstructions of @xmath0 and @xmath3 on the energy densities ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) , on the evolution of the linear growth rate of @xmath1 density perturbation ( @xmath4 ) , on the effective hubble friction term ( @xmath5 ) and on the effective newton constant ( @xmath6 ) , respectively .",
    "this will be the main aim of the present work .",
    "+ on the other hand , rsd data represent a compilation of measurements of the quantity @xmath32 at different redshifts , which were obtained in a model independent way .",
    "these data are apparent anisotropies ( effects ) of the galaxy distribution ( in redshift space ) , due to the differences of the estimates between the redshifts observed distances and true distances , and caused by the component along the line of sight ( los ) of the peculiar velocity of each of the galaxies ( recessional velocity ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , rsd data will provide tight constraints on the parameter space of the cosmic scenarios , and the necessary information to discriminate among all them @xcite .",
    "+ furthermore , another interesting observable considered here are the measurements of the alcock - paczynski ( ap ) effect @xcite .",
    "this ap test describes a distortion along the observed tangential and radial dimensions of objects , which are assumed as isotropic @xcite .",
    "this signal depends on the value of the @xmath33 parameter , and will be very useful to constrain cosmological models . in this work ,",
    "the linear growth rate @xmath4 is constrained by measuring the rsd signal , while the dilation scale ( @xmath34 ) @xcite and @xmath33 parameter @xcite evaluated at an effective redshift @xmath35 are constrained by measuring the bao and ap signals , respectively .",
    "+ now then , two distinct coupled @xmath2 models such as xcpl and dr are studied here , and from which we have found a determined number of different effects such as a reduction or enhancement on the amplitudes of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 at large and small redshifts with respect to those found in the uncoupled models",
    ". however , these modifications should be small in order to do not have a significant impact on the matter density perturbations .",
    "furthermore , important features of the universe can be obtained from these changes , and therefore these variations depend of the chosen parameterizations for @xmath0 and @xmath3 , respectively . in this article ,",
    "all our models are constrained using an analysis combined of jla ( sne ia ) @xcite , the growth rate of structure formation obtained from rsd data @xcite , bao data @xcite , cmb data @xcite and the h data set @xcite .",
    "+ finally , we organize this paper as follows : the background equation of motions for the energy densities are presented in section ii . in section iii",
    "we describe the reconstruction schemes for @xmath0 and @xmath3 , respectively . in section",
    "iv we show the theoretical @xmath2 models . in section v we studied the conditions for the crossing of @xmath36 line , and define the redshift crossing points .",
    "the perturbed equation of motions and the equations of structure formations are described in section vi .",
    "the current observational data and the priors considered are presented in section vii .",
    "we discuss our results in section viii . in section ix , we conclude our main results .",
    "in a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe its background dynamics is described by the following set of equations for their energy densities ( detailed calculations are found in @xcite , so we do not discuss them here . )",
    "@xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the energy densities of the baryon , radiation , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "now , defined the hubble expansion rate as @xmath42 , and `` @xmath43 '' indicates differentiation with respect to the cosmic time @xmath44 .",
    "+ in what follows , we shall assume that there is not energy transfer from @xmath2 ( @xmath1 ) to baryon or radiation , and among them only exist a gravitational coupling @xcite .",
    "for convenience , we defined the critical density @xmath45 and the critical density today @xmath46 ( in where @xmath47 is the current value of the hubble parameter ) . considering that @xmath48 , and then the normalized densities become @xmath49 the first friedmann equation is given by @xmath50\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and with the following relation for all time @xmath51 the scale factor @xmath52 is related to the redshift through @xmath53 ,",
    "from which find @xmath54 .",
    "substituting this last relation into eqs.([eofb])-([eofde ] ) , and solving eqs.([eofb ] ) and ( [ eofr ] ) , we find @xmath55 these equations are fundamental to determine the results within our models .",
    "the chebyshev polynomials form a complete set of orthonormal functions on the interval @xmath57 $ ] , and have the property to be the minimal approximating polynomials . it is to say",
    ", they have the smallest maximum deviation from the true function at any given order @xcite .",
    "+ because of the unknown of the origin and nature of the dark fluids , it is not possible to derive @xmath0 from fundamental principles , but we have the freedom of choosing any possible form of @xmath0 that satisfies eqs . ( [ edfdmomega ] ) and ( [ edfdeomega ] ) simultaneously .",
    "hence , we propose a phenomenological form for a varying @xmath58 , which could be definitely a function of @xmath40 multiplied both by a quantity with units of inverse of time ( for instance @xmath59 ) and by the coupling term , @xmath60 .",
    "since @xmath60 can be modelled as a varying function of @xmath22 and used to measure the strength of the interaction , it can be reconstructed conveniently in terms of chebyshev polynomials .",
    "accordingly , we can look new physical properties in spite of the fact that @xmath0 may be determined by the universal expansion rate @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , this scenario will simplify the analytic results , if we reconstruct @xmath60 from observational data .",
    "an energy exchange in the dark sector can be chosen as @xmath61 here , the strength of the coupling is characterized by @xmath62 where the coefficients of the polynomial expansion @xmath63 are free dimensionless parameters @xcite , and @xmath64 represent the first three chebyshev polynomials . + within the cpl model , the past evolution history may be successfully described by its eos parameter , @xmath3 , but the future evolution may not be explained , because @xmath3 grows increasingly , and then , encounters a divergence when @xmath65 .",
    "that is not a physical feature .",
    "consequently , to avoid such divergence problem we propose here a complete phenomenological reconstruction of a smoothly varying eos parameter , @xmath3 , which can also be expanded in terms of an expansion of the chebyshev polynomials such that @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are free dimensionless parameters .",
    "the polynomial @xmath69 and the parameter @xmath68 were included conveniently to simplify the calculations . however , this suitable generalization should be compatible with recent observational data .",
    "likewise , @xmath70 behaves nearly linear at low redshift @xmath71 and @xmath72 , whereas in the high redshift regime @xmath73 .",

    "<S> based on general relativity ( gr ) we consider two different cosmological scenarios in where reconstruct the energy exchange ( @xmath0 ) between cold dark matter ( @xmath1 ) fluid and dark energy ( @xmath2 ) fluid , which is modelled with a @xmath2 varying equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we here investigate the main cosmological effects on the growth rate of matter density perturbations ( @xmath4 ) , on the effective hubble friction term ( @xmath5 ) , on the effective newton constant ( @xmath6 ) and on the growth index of the linear matter fluctuations ( @xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our study demonstrates that in the coupled models the evolution of these quantities are modified with respect to the predictions in the uncoupled models , and therefore could be used to distinguish among coupled @xmath2 scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we also perform a combined statistical analysis using current observational data ( geometric and dynamical probes ) to put more stringent constraints on the parameters space of the cosmic scenarios studied . </S>"
