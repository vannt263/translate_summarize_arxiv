    "understanding how the number of points fluctuates at a given length scale reveals important structural information about the point pattern .",
    "such local density fluctuations have been studied for a variety of physical systems , including one - component plasmas @xcite , molecular liquids @xcite , and the large - scale structure of the universe @xcite .",

    "@xcite , are of particular interest to us in the present paper .",
    "regular lattices of points in space are the simplest examples of super - homogeneous point patterns , but such point processes are neither statistically spatially stationary ( homogeneous ) nor isotropic . stochastic super - homogeneous point processes and fluctuations have been demonstrated to be very important in a variety of physical contexts , including the study of one component plasmas @xcite , the evolution of primordial matter density fluctuations in cosmology @xcite , and the structural properties of jammed configurations of hard spheres systems @xcite . it is considerably more difficult to construct point patterns that are statistically stationary and isotropic , although some examples have been identified @xcite . in order to shed light on this problem , our general goal is to understand the statistics of the underlying voronoi cells associated with the points of stationary and isotropic super - homogeneous point processes in arbitrary space dimension @xmath0 . a voronoi cell associated with a given point consists of the region of space closer to this point than to any other point @xcite .",
    "a first step toward the stated goal is to start by examining stationary super - homogeneous point processes in one dimension ( where isotropy is not an issue ) .",
    "specifically , we analyze such a particular one - dimensional model by studying size fluctuations and correlations of the associated voronoi cells .",
    "we derive exact results for the complete joint statistics of the size of two voronoi cells .",
    "it is additionally shown that infinitely large voronoi cells can exist in super - homogeneous point processes in one dimension .",
    "we also provide a sum rule that the correlation matrix for the voronoi cells must obey in any space dimension .",
    "before discussing the details of the model , we recall some general definitions of basic quantities that are used to statistically characterize point processes ( for rigorous definitions and analysis see @xcite ) .    a single realization of a point process is completely determined by the stochastic _ microscopic density _ function @xmath1 , which in @xmath0 dimension , can be expressed as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the usual @xmath4dimensional dirac delta function , @xmath5 is the position of the @xmath6 point in the system and the sum is over all of the points .",

    "the statistics of a point process is completely determined by the infinite set of correlation functions : @xmath10 for any integer @xmath11 , and where @xmath12 indicates the ensemble average over all the possible realizations of the point process . for definitions of more general correlation functions see ref .",
    "clearly , all of the functions @xmath13 are invariant under any permutations of the variables @xmath14 . for @xmath15",
    ", we have that @xmath16 gives the _ local average density _ of points at the spatial position @xmath17 and characterize completely all the one - point statistical properties of the system .",

    "it is the most commonly used function to study the correlation properties of an empirical particle distribution .",
    "if all the @xmath24 are invariant under a constant translation of all the points , i.e. if @xmath25 for any @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the stochastic point process is said to be _ spatially statistically stationary _ ( or _ statistically homogeneous _ ) . in most of what follows",
    "we will limit our considerations to this class of point process . in such instances , @xmath28 ( the condition @xmath29 excludes fractal point distributions ) does not depend on @xmath17 , and @xmath30",

    "( [ ergo ] ) that spatial stationarity is a necessary condition for ergodicity @xcite .",

    "here we briefly review definitions and basic properties of super - homogeneous ( or hyperuniform ) point processes . given a spatially stationary point process in @xmath0 dimensions , we can define the variance in the number of points in a sphere @xmath60 of radius @xmath61 ( the origin of the sphere is arbitrary because of the spatial stationarity ) as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the number of point in the sphere @xmath60 , which is a stochastic function .",

    "for this reason , we call this class _ critical systems_. * finally , if @xmath77 it is possible to show that @xmath78 with @xmath79 .",
    "in particular , it is possible to show that in any case @xmath80 , i.e. @xmath81 is the minimal scaling behavior for the number fluctuations versus @xmath61 for any point process ( all these considerations can be directly extended to include also any `` genuine '' continuous stochastic mass density field @xcite ) . in this case , there is an exact balance between positive and negative correlations in the density fluctuations in such a way to have eq .",

    "we will see that the answers to both questions are in the affirmative .    the first question is motivated by the following facts :    * all the commonly known super - homogeneous point processes ( lattices , quasi - crystals @xcite , the one - component plasma @xcite , @xmath192invariant processes @xcite etc . ) in the infinite - volume limit have only finite voronoi cells and spherical voids ; * by taking eq .",
