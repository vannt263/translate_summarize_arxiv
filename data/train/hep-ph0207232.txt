    "evidence for a tiny but non - zero cosmological vacuum energy density has steadily mounted in recent years @xcite . with information from a variety of observations put together",
    ", it appears that we are living in a flat universe , such that @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the density parameters associated with the vacuum energy and matter respectively .",
    "these observations pose at least two formidable theoretical challenges , namely , what physics determines the magnitude of the vacuum energy density to be of order @xmath10 and why are @xmath0 and @xmath11 in such close proximity in magnitude , considering that their evolution , at least for constant cosmological constant , can be so different . here",
    "@xmath12 gev denotes the reduced planck mass .",
    "a certain amount of theoretical prejudice suggests that the true vacuum energy density of the universe could be exactly zero .",
    "needless to say , how the zero value occurs remains a complete mystery , despite many attempts @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , following this reasoning , it has been speculated that the present universe happens to lie in a false vacuum , separated from the true vacuum by the observed energy density @xmath0 @xcite . the modest goal of this approach is to try to identify the physics underlying the origin of @xmath0 , as well as ensure that the metastable vacuum is sufficiently long lived .",
    "in this letter we propose a new mechanism for realizing @xmath0 of the desired magnitude which is based on warped geometry . while the original motivation of warped geometry was to resolve the notorious gauge hierarchy problem @xcite , it has subsequently been exploited to provide at least a qualitatively new understanding of fermion mass hierarchies and their mixings , especially within the context of neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "we will show here that the warped geometry can be further exploited to provide a new mechanism for generating @xmath0 of the desired magnitude .",
    "earlier attempt in this direction have been made in ref .",
    "recall that the tev scale in warped geometry arises from the presence of the warp factor @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes the ads curvature radius and @xmath15 is the radius of the orbifold @xmath16 .",
    "we will see that @xmath0 can be associated with the vacuum energy density of a suitable scalar field , such that @xmath17 we also discuss how the quintessence scenario @xcite can be realized within this approach .",
    "we take the fifth dimension to be an @xmath18 orbifold with a negative bulk cosmological constant , bordered by two 3-branes with opposite tensions and separated by distance @xmath15 .",
    "einstein s equations are satisfied by the non - factorizable metric @xcite @xmath19 which describes a slice of ads@xmath20 .",
    "the 4-dimensional metric is @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the ads curvature related to the bulk cosmological constant and brane tensions , and @xmath23 denotes the fifth coordinate . the ads curvature and the 5d planck mass @xmath24 are both assumed to be of order @xmath2 .",
    "the ads warp factor @xmath25 generates an exponential hierarchy of energy scales .",
    "if the brane separation is @xmath26 , the scale at the negative tension brane , located at @xmath27 , is of tev - size , while the scale at the brane at @xmath28 is of order @xmath2 . at the tev - brane gravity",
    "is weak because the zero mode corresponding to the 4d graviton is localized at the positive tension brane ( planck - brane ) .",
    "let us consider the equation of motion of a real scalar field in the background ( [ met ] ) @xcite @xmath29 which follows from the action @xmath30 here @xmath31 denotes the 5d metric and @xmath32 its determinant .",
    "in general , the 5d scalar mass consists of bulk and brane contributions @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are dimensionless parameters . in the case of supersymmetry",
    "the relations @xmath37 have to be satisfied @xcite , and @xmath38 becomes a complex scalar field which , together with a second complex scalar and a dirac fermion , forms a hypermultiplet .",

    "we note that gauge bosons show a similar behavior as we discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . numerically , for a tev - brane mass of order @xmath2",
    ", @xmath68 is comparable to the energy scale associated with dark energy ( [ lambda ] ) .",
    "of course , at this stage @xmath68 is not yet related to some vacuum energy , but merely represents a tiny particle mass . in the next section",
    "we will show how such a link can be established .    at the end of this section ,",
    "let us briefly summarize the supersymmetric case which was extensively discussed in refs .",
    "supersymmetry requires the bulk and brane mass terms to be simultaneously present . because of the special relations eq .  ( [ susy ] ) , the zero mode remains strictly massless , despite the non - zero bulk and brane masses .",
    "the wave function has an exponential form @xcite , @xmath82 for a positive ( negative ) mass squared term at the tev - brane the scalar field is localized towards the planck - brane ( tev - brane ) .",
    "the supersymmetric scalar fields thus behave similar to fermions in the warped background , which also possess massless exponential zero modes in the presence of bulk mass terms @xcite .",
    "in the last section we learned that a planck - size mass term at the tev - brane is translated into a sub - ev mass of the scalar particle .",
    "we now generalize this result to include a scalar potential on the tev - brane . this will allow as to generate tiny energy splittings in the minima of the 4d effective potential , which we hope to identify with the observed dark energy .",
    "we start with the simplest case of a massless scalar field with @xmath83 which , for instance , could be a consequence of supersymmetry .",
    "if we now switch on some general potential on the tev - brane , related for example , to supersymmetry breaking , the scalar zero mode remains , as discussed in the last section .",
    "consider the following contribution to the 5d action @xmath84 we approximate @xmath85 by a constant , and after integrating over the extra dimension , we arrive at the 4d effective potential for the zero mode @xmath86 @xmath87 where @xmath88 thus all operators on the tev - brane are red - shifted by four powers of the warp factor .",
    "the warped geometry not only generates tiny masses but also exponentially small coupling constants .",
    "this result may seem surprising since the zero mode @xmath85 is constant in the extra dimension and thus has a large overlap with the tev - brane .",
    "however , as we observe from eq .",
    "( [ norm ] ) , in the integration over the extra dimension the region close to the tev - brane is exponentially suppressed .",
    "the rescaled zero mode @xmath89 is the more appropriate object to look at . for a constant @xmath85 , the rescaled zero mode is exponentially localized towards the planck - brane , which explains the tiny quantities in eq .",
    "( [ couplings ] ) . for a very large mass squared term on the tev - brane ,",
    "i.e.  @xmath90 , there is an additional suppression of the brane operators ( [ brane ] ) induced by the dip in the zero mode .",
    "we note that scalar couplings in the bulk or on the planck - brane are not scaled down by the warped geometry .",
    "we now assume that @xmath91 in order to generate a vev for the scalar field . without additional interactions from the bulk , the tiny self coupling @xmath92 induced by the brane can stabilize the field only at a planck - size vev @xmath93 .",
    "we therefore have to introduce some additional interaction .",
    "a quartic coupling in the bulk does not feel the warping , and therefore generates @xmath94 in the effective 4d action .",
    "a quartic coupling on the planck - brane would have the same effect .",
    "the scalar field then acquires a tiny vev @xmath95 .",
    "if there is now more than one minimum with a similar vev , the energy splitting between the two minima will be on the order of @xmath96 .",
    "this is exactly what is required for the dark energy .",
    "two minima can easily arise , for example , in the case of two interacting scalar fields with a polynomial potential . we will show later that the false vacuum has a lifetime much longer than the age of the universe . in the next section",
    "we will also discuss how this setup can be stabilized against radiative corrections in a supersymmetric framework .",
    "a different possibility for the scalar field to be stabilized is by some non - renormalizable interaction in the bulk , for instance , by a @xmath97 operator . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , non - renormalizable interaction may be suppressed by much smaller energy scales than @xmath2 because of the warped geometry .",
    "however , as explained above , in some sense the flat zero mode is localized towards the planck - brane . therefore non - renormalizable operators are not enhanced , and we expect @xmath98 in the 4d action .",
    "the scalar would then be stabilized at @xmath99 , which is the kk scale .",
    "assuming that the @xmath49 symmetry in the scalar potential is broken by the cubic term on the brane , the induced energy splitting between the vacua at @xmath100 is @xmath101 .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath76 larger than what we found in the previous example . to make it compatible with the observational value ( [ lambda ] ) we",
    "either would have to increase the warp factor and end up with a kk scale of about 10 gev ( ! ) , or to reduce the suppression scale to about @xmath102 .",
    "both possibilities do not look realistic . in the next section we discuss the supersymmetric case ( with a non - vanishing bulk mass ) which gives us additional possibilities .",
    "the false vacuum energy not only leads to an exponential expansion of the universe , but will also modify the geometry of the extra dimension . to estimate the size of the back reaction we compare the false vacuum energy density to the bulk cosmological constant and brane tensions of the unperturbed randall - sundrum solution @xcite .",
    "we consider a somewhat simplified setup where the scalar vev is induced by a negative squared mass term @xmath103 at the tev - brane , as in eq .",
    "( [ brane ] ) .",
    "the potential is stabilized by a quartic self interaction in the bulk , @xmath104 . because the scalar potential changes along the extra dimension , the vacuum configuration @xmath105 does as well and has to be computed numerically .",
    "we find the profile to be @xmath106 and almost flat in the extra dimension .",
    "in the second step we assumed @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "close to the tev - brane , where the instability occurs , the profile @xmath105 increases by about 10 percent relative to its almost constant value in the bulk . on the tev - brane",
    "the scalar potential is @xmath109 . in the bulk",
    "we obtain @xmath110 .",
    "this means that einstein s equations are still completely dominated by planck - size bulk cosmological constant and brane tensions of the randall - sundrum solution @xcite .",
    "thus we can safely ignore the back reaction , at most of order @xmath111 , on the wave functions ( [ f1 ] ) and ( [ wave_susy ] ) .",
    "a crucial point is that a perturbation of the mass relations ( [ susy ] ) by some supersymmetry breaking mass term on the tev - brane with @xmath112 leaves the zero mode ( [ wave_susy ] ) practically unchanged .",
    "for @xmath113 we observe an additional reduction of @xmath85 close to the tev - brane , as in the case of a vanishing bulk mass . to obtain the 4d couplings from the brane action ( [ brane ] ) we approximate the zero mode by its supersymmetric shape ( [ wave_susy ] ) .",
    "we find @xmath114 where @xmath115 is now the tev - brane mass term required by supersymmetry and determines the shape of the zero mode . we have omitted a factor @xmath116 to some power which is of order unity .",
    "localizing the scalar zero mode towards the planck - brane by taking @xmath117 , we can suppress the induced 4d couplings even stronger than in eq .",
    "( [ couplings ] ) .",
    "this opens up new possibilities to generate a small vacuum energy density .",
    "the ( @xmath118 ) 5d supersymmetry prohibits a self interaction of the scalar field in the bulk .",
    "self interactions can be provided , however , by superpotentials on the branes , where the boundary conditions break the supersymmetry to @xmath119 .",
    "planck - brane operators are not warped down and induce order unity couplings in the 4d potential , in contrast to their tev - brane counterparts ( [ couplings_susy ] ) .",
    "localizing the scalar field close to the planck - brane , we can implement a quintessence - like solution to the dark energy problem .",
    "the cosmological evolution is assumed to leave the scalar field displaced from its minimum towards which it is slowly evolving .",
    "for polynomial potentials , the necessary slow rolling conditions are satisfied only for very large vevs @xmath120 .",
    "a small vacuum energy can therefore be explained only by extraordinarily small couplings . to generate @xmath0 from a term @xmath121",
    "requires @xmath122 . from eq .",
    "( [ couplings_susy ] ) we see that this requires @xmath123 .",
    "we can also implement this scenario by relying on the quartic term of the brane potential , @xmath124 . for @xmath125",
    "we obtain the required small @xmath126 .",
    "the other terms in eq .",
    "( [ brane ] ) as well as possible bulk self interactions have to vanish to accommodate this solution .",
    "it remains to be seen whether a realistic scenario of this type can be constructed in which the required small masses remain stable under quantum corrections @xcite .    a true cosmological constant , instead of quintessence , can be generated from a supersymmetry breaking cubic coupling which shifts previously degenerate minima .",
    "we assume that a scalar self interaction on the planck - brane leads to @xmath94 in the 4d action . if the scalar potential is now destabilized by a supersymmetry breaking brane mass ( [ couplings_susy ] ) , the induced vev is @xmath127 .",
    "the degeneracy of the minima at @xmath128 is lifted by the supersymmetry breaking cubic term on the brane ( [ couplings_susy ] ) .",
    "the induced energy splitting between the vacua is then of order @xmath129 .",
    "the preferred value of the cosmological constant ( [ lambda ] ) then leads to @xmath130 , i.e. the scalar field is localized somewhat towards the tev - brane .",
    "the mass of the scalar particles associated with @xmath38 is of order @xmath131 ev .",
    "the case with a vanishing bulk mass discussed in section 3 , can readily be embedded in the supersymmetric framework by setting @xmath132 in eq .",
    "( [ couplings_susy ] ) .",
    "then supersymmetry helps to tame radiative corrections . as in four dimensions the soft mass of the scalar zero mode , @xmath133 ,",
    "will receive a 1-loop quantum correction @xmath134 by the exchange of the scalar zero mode and its superpartner . here",
    "@xmath135 denotes the momentum cut - off and @xmath92 stems from the self coupling localized at planck - brane . as discussed above , in the case",
    "@xmath132 we have @xmath136 and @xmath137 . in the warped model",
    "there are additional radiative corrections to @xmath133 by the exchange of kk states of the scalar field .",
    "the kk states are localized towards the tev - brane .",
    "therefore they acquire a larger soft mass of order @xmath138 .",
    "the quartic coupling between two zero modes and two kk states of the scalar field is of order @xmath139 .",
    "thus loops with kk states of the scalar are of the same order as zero mode loop .",
    "it remains to be seen if performing the sum over the kk contributions , which are individually small , leads to a destabilization of the soft mass of the zero mode .",
    "since we assume the scalar field to be a gauge singlet , further quantum corrections can only come from gravity .",
    "exchange of a zero mode gravitino in the loop gives rise to @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the gravitino mass .",
    "since for the zero mode of the gravitino @xmath142 , we obtain a tiny correction even for a planck - size cut - off . for the kk gravitinos",
    "the situation is different .",
    "being localized towards the tev - brane , their supersymmetry breaking mass is tev - size @xmath143 @xcite and their dimension - six interaction with the scalar zero mode is suppressed by @xmath144 .",
    "the corresponding correction to the scalar mass is then @xmath145 .",
    "since the dimension - six operator has its support at the tev - brane , it seems plausible that the kk gravitino loop is cut off at the tev - scale . in this case",
    "its contribution to the scalar mass @xmath146 is safely suppressed . however , given the limitations and uncertainties which are inherent in our treatment of radiative corrections , the issue of the quantum stability of our approach to the dark energy problem is not yet satisfactorily settled .",
    "the false vacuum state is metastable and will finally relax to the true vacuum by thermal fluctuations and/or quantum tunneling .",
    "we must require the lifetime of the false vacuum to be longer than the age of the universe . because of the low temperature of the present universe , quantum tunneling is the dominant decay process . in the wkb approximation",
    "the tunneling probability is given by @xcite @xmath147 where @xmath148 denotes the age of the universe , and @xmath149 is the characteristic scale of the problem . in the thin wall approximation",
    "the euclidean action of the tunneling configuration @xmath150 depends on the energy splitting of the vacua @xmath151 and the `` surface tension '' of the bubble @xmath152 .",
    "vacuum decay is most effective between minima which are close to each other in field space and separated only by a low energy barrier @xmath153 . among the examples discussed before the tunneling rate is largest in the case of section 3 where @xmath154 ev . from the constraint @xmath155 we obtain @xmath156 . for a polynomial potential one finds @xmath157 ,",
    "i.e.  the false vacuum is metastable even for @xmath158 , as we expect for a potential with only a single mass scale . in the other example we discussed ,",
    "the barrier heights and scalar vevs are even much larger .",
    "thus , in all the cases discussed the false vacuum is sufficiently long lived .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that a warped geometry setting could help provide a new explanation of the origin of the tiny vacuum energy density of the universe that is indicated by recent observations .",
    "this can either be in the form of a cosmological constant or , if supersymmetry is invoked , as contribution arising from a slow rolling quintessence field .",
    "although no explanation exists as to why all other contributions to the vacuum energy density effectively vanish , it is certainly intriguing to think that resolution of the gauge hierarchy and dark energy problems may have a common origin .",
