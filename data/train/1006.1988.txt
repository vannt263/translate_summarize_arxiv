    "the equivalence principle is a cornerstone in the foundations of general relativity @xcite .",
    "indeed , the assumption of the proportionality of inertial and gravitational mass implies that in a linear gravitational potential all bodies experience the same acceleration and fall with the same rate . without this universality of free fall ,",
    "the geometrization of gravitation and its reinterpretation as curvature of spacetime would not be possible .",
    "the fact that several alternative gravitational theories predict the breakdown of the universality of free fall @xcite is one of the main reasons that drives physicists to test this bedrock of modern physics to higher and higher accuracy .    motivated by the seminal papers on neutron interferometry @xcite and the more recent , impressive matter wave experiments @xcite , we address in the present paper the question how the inertial and gravitational mass enter in non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "we show that in the case of a linear gravitational potential , quantum dynamics only involves the ratio of the two masses in complete accordance with classical newtonian mechanics .",
    "however , depending on the specific preparation of the initial state , inertial and gravitational mass may appear in a more complicated way in the time evolution of a physical state .",
    "as an example of such an initial state , we discuss the energy eigenfunctions in a linear potential @xcite , which have been analyzed e.  g. in the context of the coherence of an atom laser @xcite or in connection with the so - called atom trampoline , also known as the quantum bouncer @xcite .",
    "indeed , the energy eigenstate in this system is non - classical since the corresponding phase space equations for the wigner function do involve planck s constant @xmath0 . as a result",
    "such states are ideal objects to study the role of inertial and gravitational mass in quantum mechanics .",
    "three central results obtained in this paper stand out : ( i ) the quantum dynamics reduces to classical dynamics and therefore can only involve the ratio of the inertial mass @xmath1 and the ( passive ) gravitational mass @xmath2 , ( ii ) the spatial modulation of the energy eigenfunctions depends on the third root of the product of the two masses , and ( iii ) the energy eigenvalues of the gravitational atom trampoline are proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "the universality of free fall , often referred to as `` weak equivalence principle '' , states that all bodies experience the same gravitational acceleration independent of their internal structure and composition , provided they are so small in size that one can neglect the effects of gravity gradients .",
    "in other words , the ( inertial ) mass of a body is proportional to its weight , with an universal proportionality constant .",
    "a violation of this principle would arise e.  g. when the interaction energy between the nucleons in an atom would not contribute in the same manner to the gravitational mass , as it would for the inertial .",
    "the classical tests @xcite of the universality of free fall assume that the specific gravitational acceleration @xmath4 does depend on the internal structure or the composition of the body @xmath5 .",
    "this assumption translates in terms of the inertial and gravitational mass into the relation @xmath6 here , the gravitational acceleration @xmath7 should be considered as a standardized acceleration corresponding to a particular reference body .",
    "a measure for the breakdown of the universality of free fall is the so - called etvs parameter @xmath8 which quantifies the normalized difference in the gravitational accelerations between two different bodies @xmath5 and @xmath9 .",
    "the first tests of the equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass relied on pendulum experiments and can be traced back to newton and bessel @xcite",
    ". a great step towards higher accuracies was realized by the classical torsion balance experiments of etvs @xcite and roll et al .",
    "currently the best upper limits for the etvs parameter @xcite come from lunar laser ranging on the one hand and from the so - called  et - wash ",
    "experiment @xcite on the other .",
    "the latter uses a sophisticated rotating torsion balance and limits the etvs parameter to @xmath10 for the gravitational acceleration of beryllium and titanium towards earth .",
    "the motivation for quantum mechanical tests @xcite of the universality of free fall stems from the increase in accuracy that atom interferometry is expected to offer in the future .",
    "matter wave interferometry with freely falling @xmath11 and @xmath12 isotopes has already been performed @xcite , and several other experiments worldwide using different species of atoms are right now in preparation  @xcite .      in this paper",
    "we study the quantum mechanics of a particle in a linear potential .",
    "needless to say , this topic appears prominently in many papers , in particular in connection with the atom trampoline @xcite whose energy eigenstates have been theoretically investigated in @xcite , as well as in the context of cold neutrons @xcite .",
    "the work closest to ours is that of davies @xcite who has investigated the problem of a quantum mechanical particle in a linear gravitational field to gain insight into the equivalence principle .",
    "however , motivated by the classical motion his main emphasis is on a thorough analysis of the travel time of wave packets . in complete agreement with our conclusion that the dynamics is classical",
    ", he finds that classical and travel times agree far from the classical turning point . however , there are quantum corrections near the turning point .",
    "his calculations are based on the definition of the peres quantum clock  @xcite .",
    "we start in sect .",
    "[ sec : inertialgravitationalmass ] by recalling the universality of free fall in newtonian mechanics .",
    "since we are interested in the wigner phase space formulation of the corresponding quantum mechanical version , we first introduce in sect .",
    "[ sec : quantumdynamics ] the quantum liouville equation describing the dynamics of the wigner function in an arbitrary potential .",
    "moreover , we present the partial differential equations in phase space determining an energy eigenstate in this potential . in sect .",
    "[ sec : universalityqm ] we then apply these equations to analyze the dynamics of the wigner function in a linear gravitational potential , as well as to determine the wigner function of the corresponding energy eigenstates . whereas the quantum dynamics just reflects the classical time evolution and does not depend planck s constant @xmath0 , the phase space analog of the energy eigenstates does display quantum features and involves @xmath0 .",
    "this fact stands out most clearly in the energy eigenfunctions of the linear potential discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : energywavefunction ] , where we show that the wave vector governing the spatial modulation of the probability density is determined by the third root of the product the inertial and gravitational mass .",
    "in addition , we examine the energy eigenfunctions and the eigenvalues of the atom trampoline , also known as quantum bouncer , that is a particle trapped in the bounded potential resulting from the combination of a linear potential and an infinitely steep wall .",
    "we conclude in sect .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] by summarizing our results and by outlining possible experiments .    in order to keep",
    "the paper self - contained we summarize concepts pertinent to the present discussion in several appendices .",
    "for example in appendix  [ app : nonpreading ] we recall that the time evolution of a particle in a linear potential can be represented in phase space as a product of a shearing operator followed by a displacement .",
    "it is only the displacement which contains the gravitational acceleration .",
    "this decomposition provides us with deeper insights into the physics of non - spreading airy wave packets as outlined in appendix  [ app : nonspreadingairy ] .",
    "we dedicate appendix  [ app : semiclassical ] to a discussion of the semi - classical limit of the energy wave function in a linear gravitational potential . within the jeffreys",
    " wentzel  kramers  brillouin ( jwkb ) approximation we regain the universality of free fall .",
    "moreover , we can identify phase space quantization as the origin of the unusual scaling properties of the energy eigenvalues of the atom trampoline in terms of inertial and gravitational mass .",
    "we conclude in appendix  [ app : interferometry ] with a phase space analysis of the atomic fountain .",
    "in the present section we briefly recall newton s law of motion for a single particle in a linear gravitational potential which shows that the dynamics only depends on the ratio between the gravitational and the inertial mass . for this reason ,",
    "the free fall of two particles of different compositions is identical provided the inertial and gravitational mass are proportional to each other and the particles start with the same initial conditions .",
    "note that the universality of free fall requires the mentioned proportionality constant to be independent of the particles composition , in which case it can be absorbed in the universal gravitational acceleration .",
    "moreover , we examine the dynamics of a classical ensemble of identical particles falling in linear gravitational potential , thereby emphasizing some complications that come along with tests of the universality of free fall based on classical statistical mechanics .",
    "since we consider a homogeneous gravitational potential , we can restrict our analysis of the dynamics and kinematics to one spatial coordinate @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , instead of dealing separately with the inertial and gravitational mass , we will take advantage of the particle dependent gravitational acceleration  ( [ eq : gtilde ] ) and denote the inertial mass of a particle most of the time by @xmath14 .",
    "the time evolution of a particle moving in an external potential @xmath15 follows from newton s law of motion @xmath16 where the dots indicate differentiation with respect to time .    for a linear gravitational potential @xmath17",
    "we obtain from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gtilde ] ) and  ( [ eq : newtoneq_of_motion ] ) @xmath18 a breakdown of the universality of free fall would manifest itself in a particle dependent gravitational acceleration @xmath19 .",
    "the solution of newton s law of motion  ( [ eq : eq_of_motion_lin_pot ] ) reads @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the initial position and velocity of the test particle , respectively .",
    "therefore , tests of the universality of free fall require identical initial conditions for the two test particles .",
    "so far , we have concentrated on the dynamics of a single particle in a linear gravitational field with a well defined initial position @xmath21 and a well defined initial velocity @xmath22 .",
    "however , in reality it is impossible to prepare the state of the physical system with arbitrary accuracy .",
    "for this reason we now consider the dynamics of an ensemble of particles described by a classical distribution function @xmath23 the probability to find the particle between @xmath13 and @xmath24 with a velocity between @xmath25 and @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 .",
    "the probability interpretation requires that @xmath28 is positive everywhere .",
    "next we turn to the dynamics of the initial ensemble due to a conservative force @xmath29 originating from the potential @xmath15 .",
    "the requirement of conservation of probability leads us to the classical liouville equation @xmath30 subjected to the initial condition @xmath31 .    for the linear potential @xmath32 , given by  ( [ eq : linpotential ] )",
    ", this equation takes the form @xmath33 where we have recalled the definition of specific gravitational acceleration  ( [ eq : gtilde ] ) .",
    "it is easy to verify , that the solution of  ( [ eq : cl_liouvillelin ] ) reads @xmath34    this expression brings out most clearly the fact , that the dynamics of @xmath28 only depends on @xmath19 , that is on the ratio of gravitational and inertial mass .",
    "however , this property does not exclude the possibility , that @xmath35 can contain in addition a dependence on the inertial mass , since the initial distribution @xmath28 might involve the inertial mass .",
    "for example , the stationary solution @xmath36 \\label{eq : boltzmann}\\ ] ] of the boltzmann equation representing a gas of colliding particles at temperature @xmath37 in a trapping potential @xmath38 involves the inertial mass @xmath39 . here ,",
    "@xmath40 and @xmath41 denote a normalization factor and the boltzmann constant , respectively .",
    "when we take @xmath42 as the initial distribution of our ensemble of particles propagating in the gravitational field , the final distribution @xmath35 will obviously involve not only @xmath19 but also the inertial mass @xmath39 .",
    "hence , in a comparison of the free fall of two ensembles of particles of different composition ,",
    "it is important to ensure that the initial distributions are identical . for the example of two different species of atoms , prepared in the stationary solution of the boltzmann equation , given by  ( [ eq : boltzmann ] )",
    ", this requirement implies that the temperatures and binding potentials have to be adjusted appropriately .",
    "hence , in the case of two initial ensembles of particles described by a distribution function in position  velocity space , a test of this universality of free fall is more complicated .",
    "although each member of the ensemble satisfies the universality of free fall , the two initial distributions have to be identical in order to create two comparable situations .",
    "in classical mechanics kinematics describes motion without going into the origin of the motion . on the other hand dynamics asks for the origin of the motion . in the same spirit",
    "quantum kinematics describes the quantum states and quantum dynamics their time evolution . throughout our paper , this distinction will be reflected in the separate treatment of initial states and their time evolution . in particular , we consider energy eigenstates as natural candidates for initial states .    to the best of our knowledge",
    "the distinction between kinematics and dynamics has been spelled out for the first time most clearly by weyl in his book `` the theory of groups and quantum mechanics '' @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that in this book , weyl also defines the concept of averages of symmetrically ordered operators using a distribution function , which later became the wigner function @xcite .",
    "it is this phase space function which we use in our quest to analyze how the inertial and the gravitational mass manifest themselves in quantum mechanics .",
    "we devote the present section to a brief review of the wigner distribution and focus on the elements most pertinent to the present discussion : the quantum liouville equation and the phase space analog of the time independent schrdinger equation .",
    "the wigner function @xmath43 is a quasi - probability distribution which lives in phase space spanned by the position @xmath13 and its conjugate variable , the momentum @xmath44 .",
    "when the state of the quantum system is described by a density operator @xmath45 , the corresponding wigner function reads @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes a position eigenstate .",
    "this expression brings out the fact that the wigner function is real .",
    "however , it is not necessarily positive .",
    "moreover , the wigner function satisfies the marginal properties @xmath48 and @xmath49 that is the integrals over the phase space variables @xmath44 and @xmath13 yield the corresponding quantum mechanical probability densities @xmath50 and @xmath51 of the conjugate variables .",
    "the definition  ( [ eq : def_wignerfkt ] ) of the wigner function suggests that this formulation of quantum mechanics rests on the schrdinger representation and requires a wave function or a density operator as a starting point .",
    "however , this impression is misleading .",
    "the wigner phase space formulation of quantum mechanics is an approach in its own right . in principle",
    ", there is no need to resort to wave functions or density operators . for a more detailed introduction to the wigner function",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of a quantum state @xmath52 describing the motion of a non - relativistic quantum particle of inertial mass @xmath39 in a potential @xmath15 follows from the schrdinger equation @xmath53 with the hamiltonian @xmath54    this description is equivalent to the quantum liouville equation @xmath55 which governs the time evolution of the wigner function @xmath43 . here",
    "the differential operator @xmath56 involves only odd derivatives of the potential @xmath57 and even powers of @xmath0 .",
    "although the quantum liouville equation is in general derived from the time dependent schrdinger equation  ( [ eq : schroedinger_eq ] ) , we could also interpret  ( [ eq : qu_liouville ] ) as the equation of motion for the wigner function without any reference to the schrdinger formulation of quantum mechanics . indeed ,",
    "if we possess a priori knowledge about the initial wigner function , there is no need to refer to the time dependent density operator @xmath58 , since the wigner function @xmath59 contains all information of a quantum system .",
    "energy eigenstates @xmath60 of the time independent schrdinger equation @xmath61 are the elementary building blocks of quantum mechanics .",
    "we now briefly motivate the phase space analog of this equation .",
    "three steps lead to the partial differential equations in wigner phase space for an energy eigenstate : ( i ) multiply  ( [ eq : tise ] ) by @xmath62 , ( ii ) apply the weyl  wigner correspondence @xcite and ( iii ) take the real and imaginary part of the resulting equation . in this way we obtain two partial differential equations for the wigner function @xmath63 of the energy eigenstate that must be mutually satisfied .    the imaginary part yields the time independent quantum liouville equation    @xmath64    which through @xmath65 contains odd derivatives of the potential only .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : pde_wignere2 ] ) is the quantum liouville equation  ( [ eq : qu_liouville ] ) with a vanishing time derivative .",
    "this feature reflects the fact that an energy eigenstate only picks up a phase during its time evolution and the wigner function is bi - linear in the state . as a result , this phase factor drops out and the wigner function of an energy eigenstate is time independent .    from the real part",
    "we obtain the analog @xmath66    of the time independent schrdinger equation which involves only even derivatives of the potential in the differential operator @xmath67 it is interesting that both , @xmath68 as well as @xmath69 , contain only even powers of  @xmath0 .      in order to obtain a unique solution of the quantum liouville equation  ( [ eq : qu_liouville ] )",
    ", we must specify the initial wigner function @xmath70 . however , the choice of @xmath71 is a subtle and context dependent enterprise . according to planck",

    "we can interpret the right hand side of this inequality as the effective area of phase space taken up by a quantum state @xcite .",
    "but even if we would choose a normalizable function in phase space that satisfies this inequality , it is not clear that it represents a physical wigner function , since it must be related to a quantum state with positive semi - definite density operator via the weyl  wigner correspondence . for a characterization of the set of all phase space functions that represent physical wigner functions we refer to @xcite , or in the special case of gaussian phase space functions to  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the energy eigenvalue equations  ( [ eq : pde_wignere ] ) as well as the dynamical equation  ( [ eq : qu_liouville ] ) ensure the existence of a valid initial wigner function and its time evolution .",
    "since @xmath0 appears differently in the dynamical and kinematical equations of wigner phase space , one could imagine , at least mathematically , an extended phase space theory of quantum mechanics in which both planck s constants differ from each other .",
    "for example , a problem where the concept of two different @xmath0 turned out to be useful @xcite is kramer s dilemma and the langer transformation .",
    "however , such an extension would probably lead to a physically inconsistent theory . in this sense",
    "there is a parallelism between the equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass in general relativity and the identity of planck s constants of dynamics and kinematics in quantum mechanics .",
    "next we consider the partial differential equations  ( [ eq : qu_liouville ] ) and ( [ eq : pde_wignere ] ) determining the wigner function from phase space for the case of a linear gravitational potential given by  ( [ eq : linpotential ] ) .",
    "we again analyze quantum dynamics and kinematics separately .      for the linear potential  ( [ eq : linpotential ] ) the second and",
    "all higher derivatives vanish . as a result , the operator @xmath69 , containing all odd derivatives of the potential are zero and the equation of motion for the wigner function  ( [ eq : qu_liouville ] ) reduces to @xmath74 and no longer involves planck s constant @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , the quantum liouville equation simplifies to the classical liouville equation  ( [ eq : cl_liouvillelin ] ) for the linear potential when we recall the relation @xmath75 between the momentum and the velocity of the particle .",

    "the explicit expression  ( [ eq : wignerfunction_dynamics ] ) for the time evolution of the wigner function emphasizes again the difference between dynamics and kinematics . since the quantum liouville equation reduces to the classical liouville equation in the case of a linear potential , each point in phase space propagates according to classical mechanics while maintaining its `` weight '' as given by the initial wigner function @xmath78 . as a result ,",
    "the _ dynamics _ only involves the ratio @xmath79 .",
    "however , the initial state may depend on the inertial or gravitational mass in a nontrivial way and therefore the wigner function @xmath59 may not only involve the mass ratio @xmath79 . here",
    "we find a complete analogy to the classical treatment of sect .",
    "[ sec : ensembledynamics ] , with one distinct difference : not every initial quasi - probability distribution @xmath80 in phase space corresponds to a possible quantum state .",
    "we emphasize that the time evolution of the wigner function in a linear potential given by  ( [ eq : wignerfunction_dynamics ] ) can be related in a straightforward manner to the free propagation , as discussed in appendix  [ app : nonpreading ] .",
    "one important consequence of this consideration is the fact , that the specific gravitational acceleration @xmath19 does not influence the spreading of the wave packet , but only its position along the @xmath13-axis . in other words ,",

    "in sect .  [ sec : universalityqm ] we have presented an exact expression for the time evolution of the wigner function in a linear potential .",
    "the main emphasis of this section was the dependence on the inertial and the gravitational mass .",
    "we dedicate the present appendix to represent this dynamics as the product of a shearing and a displacement operator acting on the wigner function in phase space .",
    "this analysis is reminiscent @xcite of the one in a time dependent harmonic oscillator .",
    "we start by recalling  ( [ eq : wignerfunction_dynamics ] ) for the time dependence @xmath134 of the wigner function in terms of the momentum rather than the velocity variable .    in the absence of gravity , that is for @xmath135 , equation  ( [ eq : wignerfunction_dynamics2 ] ) reduces to @xmath136 and represents the dynamics of a free particle described by the hamiltonian @xmath137    the appearance of @xmath44 in the first argument of the wigner function  ( [ eq : wignerfunction_freedynamics ] ) is responsible for the familiar shearing effect of the wigner function . due to the marginal property  ( [ eq : wigner_marginalp ] ) , the shearing in phase space translates into a dispersion of the wave packet in position space .",
    "when we introduce the displacement operator @xmath138 and the time dependent shearing operator @xmath139 which act on any phase space function @xmath140 , we can represent the time evolution of the wigner function in a linear gravitational potential  ( [ eq : wignerfunction_dynamics2 ] ) in the compact form @xmath141 here we have introduced the time dependent displacement @xmath142 containing the specific gravitational acceleration @xmath19 .",
    "we emphasize that the operator @xmath143 provides a representation of the lie group of translations in phase space , whereas @xmath144 corresponds to the lie group of shear mappings , accordingly .",
    "in particular , the order of @xmath143 and @xmath144 is important , as reflected by the identity @xmath145    in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] we show the time evolution of a gaussian wigner function @xmath70 in the presence and absence of a linear potential confirming the decomposition  ( [ eq : decomposition ] ) into the product of a time dependent shearing and displacement . an important consequence of this feature is the fact that the linear potential has no influence on the spreading of the wave packet .",
    "the spreading is solely due to the free time evolution of the particle given by the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : freehamiltonian ] ) .",
    "( _ blue _ ) or @xmath146 ( _ red _ ) .",
    "the upper picture also indicates the average energy @xmath147 of the wave packet .",
    "the center of the wigner function of the free particle propagates along a straight line ( _ blue line _ ) , whereas the wigner function in the linear potential follows a parabola  ( _ red line _ ) .",
    "the time evolved quasi - probability distributions are depicted at three different times and clearly illustrate the fact that the time evolution in a linear potential can be decomposed into a free propagation followed by a shift @xmath148 in phase space . ]",
    "another surprising implication of  ( [ eq : decomposition ] ) is the fact that the linear gravitational potential can not influence the interference fringes in phase space of a schrdinger cat state that consists of a superposition of two gaussians centered around the same position but with slightly different initial momenta . in fig .",
    "[ fig : springbrunnen ] we show the time evolution of the wigner function corresponding to this superposition state .",
    "we note that the interference fringes do change in the course of time .",
    "however , this change arises solely from the shearing effect and is not due to the gravitational field . indeed , according to  ( [ eq : decomposition ] ) gravity only enters through the displacement of the schrdinger cat obtained from the shearing of free motion .",
    "corresponding to a schrdinger cat state consisting of a superposition of two gaussian states located at the same position but with different initial momenta . ]    the property of the wigner function to track the classical trajectory is not restricted to a time independent linear potential , but can be extended to arbitrary @xmath149 , resulting in a generalized shift @xmath150 in phase space .",
    "we note that this perspective has also been used in the context of many - body theory and the gross  pitaevskii equation to separate the center - of - mass motion from the internal dynamics @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of the energy eigenfunction @xmath116 given by  ( [ eq : stationary_u_e ] ) is the fact  @xcite that it does not spread during the free time evolution governed by the hamiltonian @xmath151 defined by  ( [ eq : freehamiltonian ] ) .",
    "instead , it preserves its shape and accelerates in positive @xmath13-direction with a rate @xmath152 .",
    "the representation of the quantum dynamics in a linear potential as a product of shearing and displacement in phase space discussed in appendix  [ app : nonpreading ] offers new insights into the origin of non - spreading airy - type wave packets .",
    "indeed , the wigner phase space description of quantum mechanics allows a rather straight forward derivation of this effect .",
    "we elucidate its connection to a specific invariance property of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamilton_function ] ) and show that this symmetry relation defines a broader class of wigner functions that all correspond to non - spreading wave packets . as an example of this broader class we examine the wigner function that follows from an incoherent superposition of energy eigenstates  ( [ eq : stationary_u_e ] ) .",
    "we conclude with an alternative view on the effect of non - spreading wave packets based on the transformation to an accelerated reference frame .",
    "the wigner function  ( [ eq : stationaryw_e ] ) of an energy eigenfunction is time independent .",
    "thus , by inserting @xmath87 into the time evolution equation  ( [ eq : decomposition ] ) , we arrive at the relation @xmath153 when we multiply  ( [ eq : decomp_eigen ] ) by the inverse operator @xmath154 of @xmath143 , we find @xmath155 this equation enjoys an interesting interpretation : the shearing of the wigner function @xmath87 is equivalent to a displacement of @xmath87 by @xmath156",
    ". therefore , @xmath87 preserves its shape during the free time evolution given by  ( [ eq : wignerfunction_freedynamics ] ) and shifts its position in phase space according to @xmath157    when we take advantage of the marginal property  ( [ eq : wigner_marginalp ] ) of the wigner function  ( [ eq : nonspreadwigner ] ) , we find the identity @xmath158 which indicates that the initial probability density of the energy eigenstate  ( [ eq : stationary_u_e ] ) does not spread during the free time evolution , but accelerates .",
    "the wigner function @xmath87 is not the only quasi - probability distribution whose marginal @xmath159 exhibits this interesting feature .",
    "since the non - spreading behavior of the wave packet can be traced back to the invariance relation  ( [ eq : decomp_eigen ] ) , any phase space distribution @xmath160 that obeys the identity @xmath161 possesses a probability density @xmath159 in position space that does not spread during free time evolution .",
    "the invariance property  ( [ eq : symmetry ] ) implies that the corresponding function @xmath160 must depend on the phase space coordinates @xmath13 and @xmath44 only via the classical hamiltonian @xmath162 of the particle in a linear potential .    indeed ,",

    ", we differentiate  ( [ eq : symmetry ] ) with respect to the time @xmath166 and insert @xmath167 .",
    "the resulting equation coincides with the time independent quantum liouville equation  ( [ eq : eigenvalueeq2 ] ) , whose general solution is found by the method of characteristics and exactly coincides with the class of phase space functions  ( [ eq : wignerclass ] ) .",
    "we emphasize , that the phase space distributions  ( [ eq : wignerclass ] ) can not be normalized .",
    "in fact , when we introduce the new phase space coordinates @xmath168 the normalization condition can be expressed as @xmath169 since the integral over @xmath170 diverges , @xmath171 and therefore its marginals can not be normalized .    as a consequence , a wave packet that corresponds to a wigner function satisfying the invariance relation  ( [ eq : symmetry ] ) can not be exactly realized in an experiment and does not allow the definition of the expectation values @xmath82 and @xmath172 .",
    "this fact saves the day for ehrenfest s theorem .",

    "[ fig : eigenwignerincoherent ] .",
    "in particular , the domains of phase space where the wigner function @xmath184 assumes negative values have almost disappeared . however , due to its functional dependence on @xmath185 , the parabolic profile has survived .    in the limit @xmath186 for which the energy distribution approaches a @xmath187-function centered around @xmath147 , we recover from  ( [ eq : incoherentwigner ] ) the wigner function @xmath188 of the energy eigenstate @xmath189 .     corresponding to an incoherent superposition of energy eigenstates @xmath60 of a linear potential , that is of wigner functions  @xmath93 with a gaussian weight function  ( [ eq : incoherentdistr ] ) of energy spread @xmath190 and average energy @xmath147 .",
    "in contrast to the wigner function of a single energy eigenstate , this distribution shows strongly suppressed oscillations in the domain @xmath191 and has a rather broad maximum sightly left to the classical parabolic phase space trajectory corresponding to @xmath147 .",

    "an alternative explanation for the non - spreading wave packet rests on a coordinate transformation  @xcite from an inertial to an uniformly accelerated reference frame .",
    "it is worthwhile to translate this idea into wigner phase space in order to obtain yet another interpretation of the invariance relation  ( [ eq : hamsym ] ) .",

    "the phase difference @xmath274 between the two paths is half the difference @xmath276 between the phases of two energy wave functions in a linear potential of slightly different energies .",
    "each wave represents an interferometer  it is the interference of two counter - propagating waves as expressed by  ( [ eq : u_e_superposition ] ) .",
    "the phase @xmath282 is the area in phase space enclosed by a straight line at @xmath117 and the parabola corresponding to the energy @xmath84 .",
    "the area of the `` crescent moon '' is thus the difference of the areas representing the phases of the wkb energy wave functions in a linear potential .",
    "we conclude by comparing the interference contained in a schrdinger cat such as the one shown in fig .",

    "we consider the quantum state of the center - of - mass motion in a linear gravitational field .",

    "@xmath285 denotes a normalization constant .",
    "in contrast , in the atomic fountain we have the states @xmath244 and @xmath245 each of which consists of the superposition of two states which only differ in the phase @xmath265 .",
