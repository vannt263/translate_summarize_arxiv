    "the very short lifetime of the @xmath0 lepton ( @xmath10s ) makes it very difficult to measure its electric and magnetic dipole moments . the present resolution on its anomalous magnetic moment",
    "@xmath1 is only of @xmath11  @xcite , more than an order of magnitude larger than its standard model ( sm ) prediction @xmath12 .",
    "in fact , while the sm value of @xmath1 is known with a tiny uncertainty of @xmath13  @xcite , this short lifetime has so far prevented the determination of @xmath1 measuring the @xmath0 spin precession in a magnetic field , like in the electron and muon @xmath14@xmath15@xmath16 experiments .",
    "instead , experiments focused on various high - precision measurements of @xmath0 pair production in high - energy processes , comparing the measured cross sections with the sm predictions . as these processes involve off - shell photons or taus in the @xmath17 vertices , the measured quantity is not directly @xmath1 .",
    "a precise measurement of @xmath1 would offer an excellent opportunity to unveil new physics effects .",
    "indeed , in a large class of theories beyond the sm , new contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of a lepton @xmath18 of mass @xmath19 scale with @xmath20 . therefore , given the large factor @xmath21 , the @xmath14@xmath15@xmath16 of the @xmath0 is much more sensitive than the muon one to electroweak and new physics loop effects that give contributions proportional to @xmath20 . in these scenarios ,",
    "the present discrepancy in the muon @xmath14@xmath15@xmath16 suggests a new - physics effect in @xmath1 of @xmath22 ; several theories exist where this nave scaling is violated and much larger effects are expected  @xcite .    ever since the very first discovery of @xmath23 violation in the 1960s there have been ongoing efforts to measure fundamental electric dipole moments ( edms ) .",
    "indeed , edms violate parity and time reversal ; if @xmath24 is a good symmetry , @xmath25 violation implies @xmath23 violation and vice versa .",
    "the sm predictions for lepton edms are far too small to be seen by projected future experiments .",
    "hence , the observation of a non - vanishing lepton edm would be evidence for a @xmath23-violating new physics effect  @xcite .",
    "the experimental determination or a stringent bound on the @xmath0 lepton edm @xmath2 poses the same difficulties that one encounters in the case of @xmath26 : the @xmath0 s lifetime is very short .",
    "nonetheless , a @xmath23 violation signature arising from @xmath2 was searched for in the @xmath27 reaction reaching a sensitivity to @xmath2 of @xmath4 cm  @xcite .",
    "after a brief review of the present experimental and theoretical status of the @xmath0 dipole moments , we discuss the possibility to probe them via precise measurements of the decays @xmath6 ( @xmath28 or @xmath8 ) .",
    "the sm prediction for @xmath1 is given by the sum of qed , electroweak ( ew ) and hadronic terms .",
    "the qed contribution has been computed up to three loops : @xmath29 ( see  @xcite and references therein ) , where the uncertainty @xmath30 has been assigned for uncalculated four - loop contributions .",
    "the errors due to the uncertainties of the @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) and @xmath33 terms ( @xmath34 ) , as well as that induced by the uncertainty of @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) , are negligible .",
    "the sum of the one- and two - loop ew contributions is @xmath37 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the uncertainty encompasses the estimated errors induced by hadronic loop effects , neglected two - loop bosonic terms and the missing three - loop contribution .",
    "it also includes the tiny errors due to the uncertainties in @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "similarly to the case of the muon @xmath14@xmath15@xmath16 , the leading - order hadronic contribution to @xmath1 is obtained via a dispersion integral of the total hadronic cross section of the @xmath40 annihilation ( the role of low energies is very important , although not as much as for @xmath41 ) .",
    "the result of the latest evaluation , using the whole bulk of experimental data below 12  gev , is @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "the hadronic higher - order @xmath43 contribution @xmath44 can be divided into two parts : @xmath45 the first one , the @xmath33 contribution of diagrams containing hadronic self - energy insertions in the photon propagators , is @xmath46  @xcite . note that navely rescaling the corresponding muon @xmath14@xmath15@xmath16 result by a factor @xmath47 leads to the incorrect estimate @xmath48 ( even the sign is wrong ! ) .",
    "estimates of the light - by - light contribution @xmath49 obtained rescaling the corresponding one for the muon @xmath14@xmath15@xmath16 by a factor @xmath47 fall short of what is needed ",
    "this scaling is not justified .",
    "the parton - level estimate of  @xcite is @xmath50 a value much lower than those obtained by nave rescaling . adding up the above contributions one obtains the sm prediction  @xcite a_^sm = a_^qed + a_^ew + a_^hlo + a_^hho = 117 721 ( 5 ) 10 ^ -8 .",
    "[ eq : atsm ] errors were added in quadrature .",
    "the present pdg limit on the @xmath0 lepton @xmath14@xmath15@xmath16 was derived in 2004 by the delphi collaboration from @xmath51 total cross section measurements at @xmath52 between 183 and 208 gev at lep2 ( the study of @xmath1 via this channel was proposed in  @xcite ) : @xmath53 at @xmath54 confidence level  @xcite .",
    "reference  @xcite also quotes the result in the form : a _ = -0.018 ( 17 ) .",
    "[ eq : atexp ] this limit was obtained comparing the experimentally measured values of the cross section to the sm values , assuming that possible deviations were due to non - sm values of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ eq : atexp ] ) is actually a limit on the non - sm contribution to @xmath1 .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for a concise review of older , less stringent limits on @xmath1 , derived from data samples of @xmath55 ( for photon squared four - momentum @xmath56 up to @xmath57 )  @xcite and @xmath58 ( where @xmath59 but the radiating @xmath0 is not on - shell )  @xcite .",
    "other indirect bounds on @xmath1 were studied in  @xcite .",
    "comparing eqs .",
    "( [ eq : atsm ] ) and ( [ eq : atexp ] ) ( their difference is roughly one standard deviation ) , it is clear that the sensitivity of the best existing measurements is still more than one order of magnitude worse than needed . the possibility to improve these limits is certainly not excluded .",
    "future high - luminosity @xmath9 factories such as super - kekb  @xcite offer new opportunities to improve the determination of the @xmath0 magnetic properties .",
    "the authors of @xcite proposed to determine the pauli form factor @xmath60 of the @xmath0 via @xmath61 production in @xmath62 collisions at the @xmath63 resonances with sensitivities possibly down to @xmath64 or even better . in @xcite",
    "the reanalysis of various measurements of the cross section of the process @xmath55 , the transverse @xmath0 polarization and asymmetry at lep and sld , as well as the decay width @xmath65 at lep and tevatron allowed the authors to set a model - independent limit on new physics contributions , -0.007",
    "< a_^np < 0.005 , a bound stronger than that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : atexp ] ) .",
    "this analysis , like earlier ones , was performed without radiative corrections , but the authors checked that the inclusion of initial - state radiation did not affect significantly the obtained bounds .",
    "in the sm , the only sources of @xmath23 violation are the ckm - phase and a possible @xmath66-term in qcd .",
    "a fundamental edm can only be generated at the three - loop level @xcite , yielding a sm contribution which is far below experimental capabilities .",
    "models for physics beyond the sm generally induce large contributions to lepton and neutron edms , and although there has been no experimental evidence for an edm so far , there is considerable hope to gain new insights into the nature of @xmath23 violation through this kind of experiments .",
    "the current @xmath54 confidence level limits on the edm of the @xmath0 lepton are given by @xmath67 they were obtained by the belle collaboration @xcite following the analysis of @xcite for the impact of an effective operator for the @xmath0 edm in the process @xmath68 .",
    "compared to @xmath26 , the experimental sensitivity to @xmath69 is not significantly higher since in natural units the bounds on @xmath69 quoted above are of the order of @xmath70 .",
    "furthermore , as discussed previously in the case of @xmath26 , the analysis of @xcite is limited to the lo precision of the calculation of @xcite .",
    "therefore , we believe that there is considerable room for an improvement of these bounds .",
    "we propose to measure the dipole moments of the @xmath0 lepton through its radiative leptonic decays @xcite @xmath71 the authors of @xcite and @xcite have applied effective lagrangian techniques to study @xmath26 and @xmath69 .",
    "our strategy is similar : we describe radiative @xmath0 decays through an effective lagrangian @xmath72 which contains the qed lagrangian for the leptons , the effective fermi lagrangian , and the effective operators that contribute to the anomalous magnetic moment and edm of the @xmath0 lepton , i.e.@xmath73 where @xmath74 are given by @xmath75 the scale @xmath76 represents the scale where any kind of physics which is not described by @xmath72 generates a contribution to the @xmath0 s electric or magnetic dipole moment and is therefore larger than the electroweak scale , i.e.  @xmath77 . for simplicity",
    "we assume the scale @xmath76 to be equal for both operators @xmath74 , knowing that in fact the scale for the edm is much higher than that for the @xmath14@xmath15@xmath16 .",
    "the effective lagrangian @xmath72 in gives the following predictions for the @xmath0 dipole moments : a _ & = & + c_a + [ eq : atauth ] + d _ & = & c_d + [ eq : dtauth ] where the dots indicate higher - order contributions not relevant for our discussion ( note , in , that @xmath2 has no qed contribution ) .",
    "we then define the parameters _ & & c_a , + _ & & c_d , which can be determined as follows .",
    "the leading - order ( lo ) prediction of the lagrangian @xmath78 for the differential decay rate of a polarized @xmath79 into @xmath80 ( @xmath28 or @xmath8 ) is , in the @xmath0 lepton rest frame , @xmath81 ,     \\label{eq : decayrate}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath82  @xcite is the fine - structure constant , @xmath83 gev@xmath84  @xcite is the fermi coupling constant , @xmath85 gev @xcite , @xmath86 , and the kinematic variables @xmath87 are the normalized energies of the lepton @xmath88 and the photon , which are respectively emitted at solid angles @xmath89 and @xmath90 , and @xmath66 is the angle between their momenta @xmath91 and @xmath92 . also , @xmath93 is the @xmath0 polarization vector with @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the functions @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 were computed in  @xcite .",
    "the operator @xmath99 generates additional contributions to the differential decay rate in  .",
    "they can be summarised in the shift  @xcite g_0(x , y , c ) g_0(x , y , c ) + _ g_a(x , y , c ) , [ eq : achange ] and similarly for @xmath97 and @xmath98 . the operator @xmath100 produces the additional term _ m _ y _",
    "l ( _ ) g_d(x , y , z ) [ eq : dchange ] inside the square brackets of  @xcite .",
    "tiny terms of @xmath101 and @xmath102 were neglected .",
    "our goal is to provide a method to determine @xmath26 with a precision of @xmath5 or better .",
    "this calls for an analogous precision on the theoretical side . for this reason",
    ", we have corrected the decay rate in eq .   to include radiative corrections at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in qed  @xcite .",
    "the comparison of this nlo prediction , modified by the additional terms in for @xmath96 ( and similarly for @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) , to sufficiently precise data allows to determine @xmath103 ( and thereby @xmath26 via ) possibly down to the level of @xmath104 .",
    "similarly , including the additional term in , one can also determine @xmath105 which , at this level of precision , coincides with @xmath69 ( see ) .",
    "this analysis is in progress  @xcite .",
    "the contributions from the two effective operators @xmath74 to the electromagnetic form factors are the same for @xmath106 as for @xmath107 .",
    "the point is that only higher dimensional operators would give rise to a difference between these two cases , which means that such contributions are suppressed by higher powers of @xmath108  @xcite . in our case",
    ", @xmath56 may be of the order of @xmath109 while @xmath76 is certainly higher than @xmath110 and we may therefore safely neglect contributions from higher dimensional operators . of course , the requirement that @xmath111 is the fundamental hypothesis of our effective lagrangian approach .    the possibility to set bounds on @xmath1 via the radiative leptonic @xmath0 decays in was suggested long ago in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that article",
    "the authors proposed to take advantage of a radiation zero of the lo differential decay rate in which occurs when , in the @xmath0 rest frame , the final lepton @xmath18 and the photon are back - to - back , and @xmath18 has maximal energy .",
    "since a non - standard contribution to @xmath1 spoils this radiation zero , precise measurements of this phase - space region could be used to set bounds on its value . however , this method is only sensitive to large values of @xmath1 ( at the radiation zero the dependence on non - standard @xmath1 contributions is quadratic ) , and preliminary studies with belle data show no significant improvement of the existing limits  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic and electric dipole moments of the @xmath0 lepton are largely unknown . we propose to use radiative leptonic @xmath0 decays to measure the former with a sensitivity of @xmath5 or better and improve the existing limits on the latter .",
    "a preliminary analysis with belle data is in progress to determine the feasibility of this proposal  @xcite .",
