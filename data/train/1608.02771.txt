    "[ a ]    how the quarks and gluons share their longitudinal momentum in proton is an important topic of study by itself .",
    "it has been studied in @xcite within perturbative qcd and in lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "it is equally interesting to study the corresponding pattern of such momentum fractions in other phenomenological models of proton @xcite , available in current literature .",
    "one such model is that of lastovicka @xcite based on self - similarity @xcite at small _ x_. while self - similarity is not yet formally established in qcd , it is obtained in renormalization group analysis @xcite and has found its successful phenomenological applications in multi particle hadron physics @xcite , since 1980 s .",
    "phenomenological validity range of the model of ref@xcite is rather limited , @xmath1 and @xmath2 gev@xmath3 . in ref@xcite ,",
    "such pattern was studied assuming the validity in entire _",
    "x_-range @xmath4 , while in ref@xcite , it was analyzed for _",
    "_ x__@xmath5 ; _ _ x__@xmath6 and _ _ x__@xmath7 where momentum fraction carried by quarks ( @xmath8 ) and the upper bound of gluons ( @xmath9 ) were obtained for partons having momentum fraction between _",
    "_ x__@xmath10 and _ _ x__@xmath11 .",
    "the main reason behind the work of ref@xcite is that it is more reasonable to study the model in the phenomenologically allowed range of _ x _ than going beyond it , as the model@xcite has a singularity at @xmath12 , outside the range of validity .",
    "one limitation of ref@xcite was that the analytical expression for @xmath8 contains two infinite series ; one in @xmath13 and the other in @xmath14 , but only the leading term of each series was considered without studying their convergence properties .",
    "this might make the result unstable and unreliable .",
    "one of the aims of the present communication is to make a re - analysis of ref@xcite , and critically examine its stability from the point of view of convergence properties of the infinite series involved",
    ". we will then use semi analytical , as well as numerical method and obtain stable values .    in order to remove the undesirable singularity at @xmath15 in the model of ref@xcite , an alternative singularity free model @xcite",
    "was suggested but was found to be valid only in a much narrower kinematical range @xmath16 ge@xmath17 .",
    "we report the corresponding predictions of small _ x _ momentum fractions in the model , using the improved numerical method .    the results of both the models",
    "are then compared with the corresponding predictions of the qcd based and froissart bound @xcite compatible phenomenological model suggested by block , durand , ha and mckay @xcite , which has an explicit @xmath18 and @xmath19- dependent structure function .",
    "the results are then compared with the perturbative , as well as lattice qcd .    in section [ b ] , we outline the essential formalism and the model of ref@xcite : model 1 and also model 2 @xcite . in section [ c ] ,",
    "we report the essential features of the model of ref@xcite : model 3 .",
    "section [ d ] contains the conclusions .",
    "the self - similarity based model of the proton structure function of ref@xcite is based on _ x _ and @xmath19 parton distribution function(pdf ) @xmath20 . choosing the magnification factors @xmath21 and",
    "@xmath22 , the unintegrated parton density function ( updf ) can be written as @xcite    @xmath23= d_1.\\log\\frac{1}{x}.\\log\\left(1+\\frac{q^2}{q_0 ^ 2}\\right)+d_2.\\log\\frac{1}{x}+d_3.\\log\\left(1+\\frac{q^2}{q_0 ^ 2}\\right)+d_0^i\\ ] ]     + where _ i _ denotes a quark flavor . here",
    "@xmath24 are the three flavor independent model parameters while @xmath25 is the only flavor dependent normalization constant .",
    "@xmath26(=1 gev@xmath3 ) is introduced to make ( pdf ) @xmath20 , as defined below ( in eqn [ e2 ] ) , dimensionless .",
    "the integrated quark densities then can be defined as    @xmath27     + as a result , the following analytical parametrization of a quark density is obtained by using eqn([e2 ] ) @xcite : * ( model 1 ) *    @xmath28    where @xmath29",
    "+ is flavor independent . using eqn([e3 ] ) in the usual definition of the structure function @xmath30 , one can get @xmath31 or it can be written as @xmath32 + where @xmath33 + eqn([e5 ] ) involves both quarks and anti - quarks . as in ref@xcite , we assume the same parametrization both for quarks and anti - quarks . assuming the quark and anti - quark have equal normalization constants , we obtain for a specific flavor @xmath34 + it shows that the value of @xmath35 will increase as more and more number of flavors contribute to the structure function .",
    "+ with @xmath36 and 5 , it reads explicitly as @xmath37 + since each term of right hand sides of eqn([ec]),([ed ] ) , and ( [ ef ] ) is positive definite , it is clear , the measured value of @xmath35 increases as @xmath38 increases .",
    "however , single experimentally determined parameter @xmath35 can not ascertain the individual contribution from various flavors .",
    "+   + from hera data @xcite , eqn([e6 ] ) was fitted in ref@xcite with @xmath39    in the kinematical region , @xmath40      the defining equations of the model of ref@xcite ( eqn [ e1]-[e4 ] above ) do not ascertain the numerical values and signs of the parameters @xmath41 s. these are determined from data@xcite , leading to the set of eqn([e7 ] ) in the kinematic range ( eqn [ e8 ] ) . however , the phenomenological analysis has one inherent limitation : due to the negative value of @xmath42 , eqn([e6 ] ) develops a singularity at @xmath43 @xcite , as it satisfies the condition @xmath44 , contrary to the expectation of a physically viable form of structure function .",
    "we , therefore , explore the possibility of an alternate model which is singularity free .    redefining the model parameters",
    "@xmath41 s by @xmath45 s ( _ _ j__=1,2,3 ) and ( pdf ) @xmath20 by @xmath46 and also structure function @xmath30 by @xmath47 in the present model , we get the following forms of pdf and structure function as : * ( model 2 ) *    @xmath48    and @xmath49 respectively .",

    "also , the @xmath52 increases with the increasing @xmath19 , but the rise of model 1 is faster than that of model 3 for each flavors and the @xmath52 for each models grows slower on increasing @xmath38 as expected .     vs @xmath19 ( gev@xmath3 ) of * model 1 * for @xmath50 ( dots ) and @xmath51 ( squares ) + @xmath52 vs @xmath19 ( gev@xmath3 ) of * model 3 * for @xmath50 ( diamonds ) and @xmath51 ( triangles ) , width=340 ]     vs @xmath19 ( gev@xmath3 ) of * model 1 * for @xmath50 ( dots ) and @xmath51 ( squares ) + @xmath52 vs @xmath19 ( gev@xmath3 ) of * model 3 * for @xmath50 ( diamonds ) and @xmath51 ( triangles ) , width=340 ]    on the other hand , fig [ f9 ] represents the upper limit of @xmath55 vs @xmath19 ( gev@xmath3 ) of models 1 and 3 for @xmath56 4 and 5 . from fig [ f9 ]",
    ", one can see the upper limit of @xmath55 falls down as @xmath19 increases and the fall is slower with the increasing @xmath38 in each models .",
    "also the fall of model 1 is faster than that of model 3 .",

    "( [ e33 ] ) yield @xmath64 = @xmath65 : 50 % of the momentum of proton is carried by gluons , as noted in @xcite and claimed to be experimentally tested in @xcite .    in ref@xcite",
    ", it has alternative asymptotic prediction :    @xmath66    @xmath67     + where eqn([e32 ] ) and ( [ e33 ] ) implies that except for @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "specifically , for @xmath38 = 5 , eqn([e32]-[e33 ] ) yields @xmath64 = @xmath70 @xmath71 and eqn([e34]-[e35 ] ) gives @xmath64 = @xmath72 . in the above equations , @xmath57 and",
    "@xmath64 denote the momentum fractions carried by quarks and gluons respectively for the entire _ x_-range .    the difference between eqn([e32]-[e33 ] ) and eqn([e34]-[e35 ] ) is attributed in ref@xcite to the proper gauge invariant definition of gluon momentum density ; its definition in earlier works @xcite includes a quark - gluon interaction term and hence resulted in a inflated value of gluon momentum fraction in proton .",
    "however , later ji@xcite refutes the claim of chen _ et al _ @xcite , underlying the correctness of the qcd prediction , eqn([e32]-[e33 ] ) @xcite .",
    "however , none of the ref@xcite specifically states about the partial momentum fractions @xmath52 and @xmath55 , relevant for phenomenological study in limited small _ x _ regimes and finite @xmath19 , as in the present analysis .",
    "however , if the asymptotic predictions of ref@xcite are considered to be the rough indicator even for partial momentum fractions for small _ x _ quarks at the finite @xmath19 , then the present result favors the prediction of ref@xcite , instead of ref@xcite , without violating the experimental value @xcite .",
    "it is to be noted that the rise of partial momentum fraction of small _ x _ quarks with @xmath19 ( specifically , the logarithmic rise with @xmath19 in model 3 ) is not necessarily inconsistent with the overall asymptotic prediction of total momentum fraction in perturbative qcd where @xmath0 @xcite , if one analyzes the approximate @xmath19 evolution of dglap equation at small _ x _ @xcite and large _ x _",
    "@xcite respectively . at small _ x _ , one finds that the quark evolves as ( @xmath73 ( @xmath74= + ve ) while at large _",
    "x _ , the corresponding evolution will be ( @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) . further",
    ", if one assumes @xmath77 where @xmath78 @xcite and @xmath79 , then both small _ x _ quarks and gluon distribution will rise with @xmath19 and the rise will be faster for the gluons than the quarks .",
    "however , in the context of the total momentum fraction of quarks and gluons , the small _ x _ contribution is insignificantly smaller than the total and hence the intermediate and the large _ x _ partons are the dominant contributor , resulting in the expected in perturbative qcd @xcite .",
    "@xmath80 falls with @xmath19 rather than rises , as in the present analysis .",
    "it is also consistent with the well known result that the behavior of quarks and gluons at very small and large _ x _ limit are @xcite : + when @xmath81 , for small _ x _ @xcite @xmath82 for gluon @xmath83 and for large _ x _ , when @xmath84 @xcite @xmath85 also for gluon @xmath86 + here @xmath87 is -ve and others are + ve .    at intermediate _",
    "x _ scale , one generally uses an interpolating function as polynomial @xcite in _ x _ @xmath88 .",
    "taking into account all these aspects , it is therefore reasonable to expect that the total quark momentum fractions will fall with @xmath19 , while the corresponding gluon momentum fraction will rise leading to the expected qcd asymptotic prediction .",
    "+   + let us discuss our results in the context of lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "+ its predictions for total momentum fractions for individual flavor are @xmath89 = 34% , @xmath90 = 16% , @xmath91 = 4% leading to total @xmath80 = 54% .",
    "the lattice analysis also yields @xmath92 = 36% , while remaining 10% proton momentum fraction remained unaccounted .",
    "thus , the analysis does not yet rule out the possibility of @xmath80 that exceeds @xmath92 at low momentum scale of lattice qcd , where perturbative qcd is not applicable .",
    "such possibility is also not rule out in the present analysis at low @xmath19 .",
    "in this paper , we have reported partial momentum fractions carried by small _ x _ quarks in a limited _ x _ ranges of @xmath93 , first using phenomenological models of proton structure functions based on self - similarity and valid in limited ranges of small _ x_. using momentum sum rule in inequality form , we obtain upper bound on momentum fractions carried by gluons in the same _ x_-ranges . we then compare the predictions of the self - similarity based models with the predictions of the qcd based phenomenologically successful model proposed by block , durand , ha and mckay @xcite    in each model , partial momentum fractions of small _ x _ quarks increases with @xmath19 in various degrees ; liner rise in models 1 and 2 and logarithmic rise in model 3 .",
    "however , upper bound of gluon partial momentum fractions invariably far exceed them .",
    "we then compared the predictions with perturbative , as well as lattice qcd expectation .",
    "we have then suggested that such pattern of rise for small _ x _ quarks ( specifically , for the model 3 ) is not inconsistent with known prediction of perturbative qcd . at lower @xmath19 scale , lattice qcd estimation of small _ x _ quarks and gluons momentum fraction",
    "might also relevant .",
    "+   + let us conclude the paper with a few comments regarding the self - similarity as a relevant symmetry of structure of the proton , as used in models 1 and 2 .",
    "the notion of self - similarity , although very interesting and has been successfully applied in hadron multi - particle production process , is not yet established in perturbative qcd : the experimental study during last decade has not yet confirmed this idea .",
    "of course , some constraints from general approaches such as unitarity , analyticity and in particular the froissart theorem @xcite can be suitably incorporated in a self - similar proton , as been done in ref @xcite . in a recent study @xcite",
    ", it is suggested that the logarithmic rise in @xmath19 of structure function is also possible , in an improved singularity free self - similar based model with a wider kinematical range in _ x _ and @xmath19 but even then it is far short off accounting the entire @xmath94 range explored in hera unlike perturbative qcd @xcite .",
    "further , such phenomenological models have got no predictive power outside their ranges of validity .",
    "thus , it appears that the conjecture of self - similarity as a symmetry in the structure of the proton appears to have limited applicability , at least at the present experimental energy scale .",
