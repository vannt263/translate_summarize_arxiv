    "most of this meeting has involved the use of deep astronomical surveys to study the formation and evolution of galaxies and stars in their youngest phases at high redshifts through direct observations of galaxies at wavelengths ranging from the radio and submillimeter to the x - ray range . in this paper",
    ", i will discuss a complementary approach which hinges on the determination of `` historical '' intergalactic ir , optical , and uv photon densities produced by the emission of stars and the reradiation of dust in these young galaxies in the distant past .",
    "the energy distribution and densities of these intergalactic photons then become a measure of the _ total _ star production and population distributions at high redshifts from all galaxies , visible and obscured , observed and unobserved .",
    "as a zeroth order approximation to the expected intergalactic absorption at high redshifts , we take the results of backward evolution models of stecker , malkan and scully ( 2006 ) , hereafter called sms .",
    "these models are based on two plausible cases of pure luminosity evolution , _ viz . _ :    \\(1 ) in the more conservative `` baseline '' scenario , all 60@xmath8 m galaxy luminosities evolved as @xmath9 with their evolution stopped at @xmath10 and galaxy luminosities assumed constant ( nonevolving ) at the higher redshifts @xmath11 , with negligible ( assumed zero ) emission for @xmath12 .",
    "this later assumption is supported by the recent _ hubble _ deep survey results indicating that the average star formation rate is dropping off significantly at a redshift of 6 ( bunker _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ; bouwens _ et al .",
    "independent evidence from luminosity functions of lyman break galaxies at redshifts from 3 to 6 indicates a similar decrease in the star formation rate ( shimasaku _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 ) . however , it is important to note that the star formation rate for @xmath12 is _ not _ zero and this will modify the results of sms so that the predicted @xmath4-ray opacity of the high redshift universe will be somewhat different , depending on the real star formation rate of the universe at redshifts greater than 6 .",
    "\\(2 ) a `` fast evolution '' scenario where galaxy luminosities evolved as @xmath13 for @xmath14 and evolved as @xmath15 for @xmath16 with no evolution ( all luminosities assumed constant ) for for @xmath17 and , again , zero luminosity is assumed for @xmath18 .",
    "this evolution model is based on the mid - ir luminosity functions recently determined out to @xmath19 by perez - gonzalez _ et al . _",
    "the `` fast evolution '' picture is favored by recent _",
    "observations ( le floch _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 , perez - gonzalez _ et al .",
    "it provides a better description of the deep _ spitzer _ number counts at 70 @xmath8 m and 160@xmath8 m than the `` baseline '' model .",
    "however , _ galex _",
    "observations indicate that the evolution of uv radiation for @xmath20 may be somewhat slower and more consistent with the `` baseline '' model within errors ( schiminovich _ et al .",
    "also , the baseline model fits the 24@xmath8 m _ spitzer _ source counts more closely than the fast evolution model .",
    "the _ spitzer irac _ ( infrared array camera ) counts lie in between the predictions of these two models .",
    "figure [ ste : fig1 ] shows the resulting photon density @xmath21 as a function of energy at various redshifts for the fast evolution model .",
    "figure [ ste : fig2 ] shows the predicted background seds compared with the data and empirical limits ( see , _ e.g. _ , hauser and dwek 2001 ) .",
    "quantum electrodynamics shows that two photons can annihilate to produce an electron - positron pair provided that the total energy in the center of momentum system of the interaction is above the threshold for making an electron and a positron ( breit and wheeler 1934 ) . the cross section for this",
    "interaction peaks close to the threshold energy ( jauch and rohrlich 1955 ) .",
    "this results in a redshift `` horizon '' for @xmath4-rays , beyond which the universe is opaque ( stecker 1969 ; fazio and stecker 1970 ) .",
    "the sms results on the optical depth as a function of energy for various redshifts out to a redshift of 5 are shown in figure [ ste : fig3 ] .",
    "figure [ ste : fig4 ] shows the energy - redshift relation giving an optical depth @xmath22 based on the sms calculations of @xmath23 .",
    "as is shown in figure [ ste : fig3 ] , for @xmath4-ray sources at the higher redshifts there is a steeper energy dependence of @xmath24 near the energy where @xmath25 .",
    "this effect is caused by the sharp drop in the uv photon density at the lyman limit .",
    "there will thus be a sharper absorption cutoff in the multi - gev @xmath4-ray spectrum of sources at high redshifts than in the tev spectra of more nearby @xmath4-ray sources .",
    "it is important to note that _ the exact position of this cutoff in energy is directly related to the @xmath5-dependence of the star formation rate at high redshifts .",
    "_      because absorption cutoffs in the spectra of blazars at the higher redshifts lies in the multi - gev range , _ glast _ , the gamma ray large space telescope ( http://glast.gsfc.nasa.gov ) , to be launched in the fall of 2007 , will be able to make measurements of such features and thus probe the early star formation rate ( chen , reyes & ritz 2004 ) .",
    "_ glast _ will be able to detect blazars at @xmath26 at multi - gev energies , the critical energy range for the expected sharp absorption cutoffs in high redshift @xmath4-ray sources as shown in figure [ ste : fig3 ] .",
    "thus , @xmath4-ray observations by _ glast _ can complement the deep galaxy surveys and help determine the redshift when significant star formation began .",
    "in fact , _ glast _ need not have to detect @xmath4-ray sources at high redshifts in order to aquire information about the evolution of intergalactic photon fluxes . if the diffuse @xmath4-ray background radiation is from unresolved blazars ( stecker & salamon 1996 ) , a hypothesis which can be independently tested by _ glast _ ( stecker & salamon 1999 ) , the effects of @xmath4-ray absorption will steepen the spectrum of this radiation at @xmath4-ray energies above @xmath27 gev ( salamon & stecker 1998 ) .",
