    "both the atlas and cms collaborations have announced the discovery of a @xmath6 higgs boson  @xcite , mainly based on the combination of the di - photon and leptonic @xmath1 higgs searches at the @xmath7 and 8 tev lhc .",
    "this achievement fixes the last renormalizable parameter in the standard model ( sm ) . at the same time",
    ", it carries important implications for new physics , particularly for low - energy supersymemmtry ( susy ) . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , a sm - like higgs boson with 125",
    "gev mass requires large corrections beyond the tree level prediction @xmath8 .",
    "although such an 125 gev sm - like higgs boson can be accommodated , careful choices of parameters must be made  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is well motivated to consider possible extensions of the mssm which give additional contribution to the mass of the sm - like higgs boson at tree level  @xcite .    in this paper , we consider the possibility of enlarging the mssm gauge symmetry by an additional @xmath2 .",
    "such a gauge symmetry is quite generic in uv completions low energy supersymmetry , and many possible candidates have been proposed ( for a review , e.g. , see  @xcite ) .",
    "if its d - term is non - decoupling , it can provides non - trivial contribution to the tree - level mass of the sm - like higgs boson  @xcite . in order to get a sizable correction , the higgs field",
    "must be charged under this @xmath2 symmetry . moreover",
    ", the symmetry breaking scale of this extra u(1 ) symmetry can not be much higher than the ew ( ew ) one .",
    "we will focus on a gauged peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry ( @xmath9 ) , under which by definition the higgs fields carries non - trivial charges  @xcite .",
    "this can be connected to a possible solution of the @xmath3-problem  @xcite , which is one of the central pieces of using low energy supersymmetry to address the hierarchy problem .",
    "the @xmath3 problem has its origin in a scale - violating term @xmath10 in the superpotential of the mssm , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are down- and up - type higgs supermultiplets . by introducing a spontaneously broken pq global symmetry (",
    "a discrete version is the @xmath13 symmetry in the next - to - mssm ) , the bare @xmath3 term is forbidden and an effective one can be dynamically produced via @xmath14 , with @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath16 is a sm - singlet supermultiplet and @xmath17 is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of its scalar component . due to quantum gravity effects",
    ", it is expected that low energy symmetries should have their roots as gauge symmetries . in our case",
    ", we will further assume that such a gauge symmetry survives down to the tev scale .",
    "in this paper , we will show that such a promotion for the pq symmetry can significantly impact the higgs physics .",
    "in particular , the @xmath9 gauge symmetry introduces new d - terms which can raise the mass of the sm - like higgs boson at tree level , enough to have @xmath18 gev without significant radiative corrections .",
    "in addition to the mass of the higgs boson , another interesting observation is that there is a possible excess in the di - photon signal with rate higher than the sm prediction . with a combined analysis of the @xmath7 and 8 tev lhc data ,",
    "the cms and the atlas collaborations obtain the best - fit signal strength : @xmath4 and @xmath5 times of the sm prediction , respectively@xcite .",
    "if such an excess is confirmed in the future , it would be an unambiguous indication for new physics .",
    "there are two usual strategies to enhance the higgs di - photon signal rate .",
    "the first one is by suppressing the width of its @xmath19 decay mode  @xcite . in supersymmetric theories with two higgs doublets",
    ", we have the coupling ratio @xmath20 for the sm - like higgs boson ( here we focus on the scenario with the lightest cp - even higgs boson being sm - like .",
    "the discussion can be generalized to the case with the heavy cp - even higgs boson being sm - like easily ) . here",
    "the mixing angle @xmath21 is defined as @xmath22 @xmath23 and @xmath24 are light and heavy cp - even higgs bosons , respectively .",
    "suppressing the @xmath25 decay width requires a small mixing angle for the sm - like higgs boson , @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "the sm - like higgs boson therefore needs to be extremely up - type like for @xmath28 . in the mssm",
    ", it can only be achieved only through a cancellation between the tree - level and loop - level contributions to the off - diagonal higgs mass term  @xcite .",
    "but , in the extensions of mssm , the quadratic terms of the higgs sector can receive non - trivial corrections at tree level from new f - term or d - term corrections , so the mixing angle can be suppressed more easily  @xcite .",
    "a potential problem for this strategy is that the suppressed @xmath19 decay width can enhance the @xmath1 and @xmath29 signal rates as well .",
    "the current analyses by the cms and atlas collaborations in these channels do not show such a feature , although one can not completely rule out this possibility due to the limited statistics .    a more viable possibility is by enhancing the higgs di - photon decay width .",
    "such a modification requires the existence of light charged exotics ( @xmath30 gev ) , with large coupling to the sm - like higgs boson .",
    "the exotics carrying both color and ew charges might work .",
    "however , such particles typically bring larger contribution to the higgs production via gluon fusion .",
    "more often than not , it would end up suppressing the rate of @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "in addition , direct searches at colliders have already put stringent lower bound on the mass of the colored exotics .",
    "therefore , we will concentrate on the exotics with ew gauge charges only .",
    "there are several possibilities for the spin and coupling of the exotics .",
    "probably the simplest case is the so - called higgs portal couplings of the form @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is some exotic scalar carrying electric charge .",
    "it is well - known that ( for recent discussions , see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , in order to enhance the @xmath34 coupling significantly and keep the coupling perturbative , the sign of this interaction must be negative .",
    "in supersymmetry , however , an interaction of this form is from the @xmath35 term whose sign is positive . at the level of renormalizable couplings , therefore , the enhancement of the @xmath36 coupling in susy must come from yukawa ( trilinear ) couplings between the higgs boson and the exotic fermions ( scalars ) .",
    "we also emphasize that the quantum number of such light exotics and the form of the couplings will be strongly constrained by the ew precision tests ( ewpt ) .",
    "remarkably , it is possible to satisfy these conditions in a special scenario of the mssm with very light stau lepton and a large @xmath37 coupling  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the gauged @xmath9 scenario contains the exotics which can enhance the @xmath38 coupling .",
    "the @xmath9 symmetry is anomalous . gauging it",
    "necessarily requires charged exotics to cancel its anomaly .",
    "the symmetries of the theory allow yukawa and trilinear couplings between the sm - like higgs boson and the exotics .",
    "if some of the exotics happen to be light , they can significantly enhance the higgs di - photon decay width . since the exotics usually can obtain their masses through the coupling with the @xmath9 breaking spurions , setting their masses to be light simply amounts to a choice of some dimensionless couplings .",
    "precision ew tests can strongly constrain the possible parameters and the form of the couplings . taking them into account",
    ", we identify two representative benchmark scenarios to illustrate the relevant higgs physics .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the effective theory of the mssm extension with a gauged @xmath9 symmetry .",
    "we discuss the mass of the sm - like higgs boson in section iii . in section iv , we give a general discussion of new physics contributions to the higgs to di - photon decay partial width , and its connection to ewpt observables . in section",
    "v , we present an anomaly - free model and identify two benchmark scenarios where the experimental data can be fit correctly .",
    "section vi contains our concluding remarks .",
    "in particular , we comment on the lhc signal of the light exotics .",
    "we also argue that the two benchmark models identified in section v are representative of large classes of viable models beyond our current framework which can consistently enhance the higgs to di - photon rate .",
    "a full model for the scenario considered in this paper needs to start from a sector which spontaneously breaks the @xmath9 symmetry .",
    "we assume that the pq symmetry is spontaneously broken by the scalar components of the superfields @xmath39 , with their vevs being @xmath40 .",
    "the scalar potential of such a pq breaking sector can be quite complicated . in this paper",
    "we will focus on a simple but instructive limit in which the @xmath9 symmetry breaking scale is somewhat larger than the scales of ew symmetry breaking and the soft susy breaking parameters , @xmath41 . in this case",
    ", we can integrate out the particles which become heavy after the @xmath9 symmetry breaking , in particular the  radial modes \" of the symmetry breaking fields .    since the susy breaking effect is smaller than the pq symmetry one , it is convenient to group the light degrees of freedom in an axion superfield @xmath42 with @xmath43 in the representation of non - linear sigma model . here",
    "@xmath44 is the @xmath9 breaking scale and @xmath45 is the @xmath9 charge of @xmath39 . at this stage ,",

    "if the @xmath9 symmetry is global and susy breaking effect is relatively small , both @xmath47 and @xmath49 can be light , with @xmath50 . in this case",
    ", the global @xmath9 theory provides a supersymmetric benchmark scenario of @xmath51 gev dark matter , with @xmath49 serving as the candidate  @xcite . for a gauged @xmath9 symmetry , @xmath46 is eaten by the @xmath9 gauge boson .",

    "we also include the susy breaking soft terms @xmath57 , with their scales below @xmath58 .",

    "in the first benchmark , the lightest charged ( @xmath177 ) and neutral ( @xmath178 ) fermion spectators are light .",
    "they have a large coupling to the higgs fields , for enhancing the di - photon signal rate . to get a small @xmath141",
    ", the spontaneous breaking needs to be small .",
    "hence , @xmath179 is required .",
    "for the second benchmark point , where one of the charged scalar is light and couples to the higgs fields with large @xmath133 terms ( again for enhancing the di - photon signal rate ) , there is an accidental cancelation which leads to @xmath141 to be a few times smaller than its natural value .",
    "a detailed discussion of this accidental cancelation can be found in appendix b. therefore , even in the case of large @xmath100 , the @xmath135 parameter can still be within the experimental limit .",
    "in addition , although the doublets @xmath162 are vector - like under the ew gauge symmetry and their fermionic components have a degenerated mass spectrum , the @xmath134 parameter can still receive non - zero corrections .",
    "this is because @xmath162 mix with @xmath180 and @xmath181 , while the latter violate the weak isospin ( recall that the @xmath134 parameter preserves the custodial but measures the violation of the weak isospin ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath94 , @xmath182 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 on @xmath183 and @xmath100 in the first benchmark is shown in fig .",

    "as is expected , with a fixed @xmath100 , @xmath182 tends to be enhanced for a larger @xmath184 ; and with a fixed @xmath185 , @xmath141 tends to be smaller while @xmath100 is close to 1 . from the right plot on the first row of fig .  [ contour1 ] , we can see that the correction to the rate of @xmath104 also has a maximum at @xmath186 with fixed @xmath185 .",
    "we can understand this from the form of the mass matrix of charged fermionic exotics , @xmath187 where @xmath188 and @xmath189 are the vector - like mass for the doublet and charged singlet exotics , respectively .",
    "then , we can get @xmath190 since we are interested in the region where @xmath191 , we have @xmath192 , which peaks at @xmath193 .",
    "therefore , from eq .",
    "( [ higgsi ] ) , we can see that the correction to @xmath106 reaches its maximum at @xmath186 .",

    "[ contour2 ] . in this region ,",
    "since the contribution from @xmath133 terms dominates over the ones from the yukawa couplings , the loop correction to higgs mass from exotics is negative .",
    "therefore , from the first plot in fig .",
    "[ contour2 ] , we can see that @xmath94 becomes smaller with larger @xmath145 . for the correction to the rate of @xmath104 , in the region where @xmath195 , the charged scalar exotics mainly couple to the higgs through @xmath196 and therefore the correction to the @xmath104 rate behaves similarly to up - type quarks . as a result ,",
    "the relevant part of the mass matrix of the charged exotics in this limit can be reduced to @xmath197 from which we can get @xmath198 where the relation @xmath199 is used .",
    "therefore , we can see that in this region the correction to the rate of @xmath104 goes up slowly with @xmath100 which is shown in the region @xmath145 around 1500 gev in fig .",
    "[ contour2 ] , where @xmath200 is fixed to be 1000 gev . in the region @xmath201 the dependence of the correction to @xmath104 on @xmath100 is more complicated , and numerical simulation shows that the dependence is not monotonic , as shown in fig .",
    "[ contour2 ] . for the contributions to the @xmath135 parameter , because of the accidental cancelation discussed in appendix b , @xmath141 is typically small , while @xmath99 can bring a further suppression .",
    "motivated by the discovery of a @xmath6 gev higgs boson in the cms and atlas experiments , we study the possibility of lifting the tree - level mass of the sm - like higgs boson in mssm extended by an extra @xmath2 gauge symmetry . for definiteness , we focus on the scenarios with a gauged @xmath9 symmetry which can also be connected to a possible solution to the @xmath3 problem in the mssm .",
    "we limit ourselves to the parameter region in which the softly susy - breaking scale is below the @xmath9 breaking scale , @xmath202 . in this case",
    ", we can work in the framework of effective theory with only the axion supermultiplet .",
    "we explicitly demonstrate that non - trivial corrections of the @xmath9 d - term to the higgs physics necessarily require sizable softly susy breaking effects in the pq symmetry - breaking sector .",
    "in particular , a correction @xmath203 gev to the higgs mass at the tree level can be achieved for @xmath204 tev and @xmath205 .",
    "in addition to the higgs mass , the lhc data also reveals a tantalizing hint of a significantly enhanced di - photon signal rate .",
    "we show that this feature can be accommodated in this scenario . gauging the @xmath9 symmetry",
    "necessarily requires the charged exotics for anomaly cancellation .",
    "if they happen to be light and have sizable couplings with the higgs boson , the di - photon signal rate can be significantly enhanced . with the bounds from the ewpt",
    "considered , we identify two benchmark scenarios where a light charged exotic fermion and scalar plays a crucial role in modifying the @xmath38 effective coupling , respectively .",
    "testing this scenario at the lhc is relatively difficult .",
    "the first signal is probably still from the modified decays of the sm - like higgs boson .",
    "a confirmation of the enhanced di - photon signal rate would provide a potential evidence for this scenario . in this case",
    ", it is obviously important to search for the light charged exotic mediators directly at the lhc .",
    "these exotics can be produced through the processes of weak interaction and then decay into the sm particles via the interactions described in the superpotential @xmath206 .",
    "their signals are similar to that of the higgsinos , or sleptons . with the accumulation of the data",
    ", we should be able to probe these exotics .",
    "of course , it is also possible to search for the leptoquark - type exotics @xmath207 , which are required for cancelling the @xmath208 anomaly .",
    "although not directly related to the modification of the higgs di - photon decay channel , these colored particles should not be too heavy since their mass is generated through pq symmetry breaking .",
    "they can be pair - produced via qcd processes at the lhc , with leptoquark - like signals .",
    "we will leave these studies to a future work .",
    "although our study is mainly done in the context of a specific model , the lessons we have learned are fairly general .",
    "the two benchmarks are representatives of large classes of models in which an enhancement of the @xmath129 signal rate does not lead to a violation of the ewpt constraints .",
    "the first benchmark contains four @xmath209 doublets and two charged singlets for the sake of anomaly cancelation .",
    "this is only a little larger than the minimal model . as discussed in sec .",
    "iv , for the corrections from fermionic exotics to have the same sign as the w boson contribution , the mass of the fermionic exotics must have two sources .",
    "one is chiral , coming from yukawa like couplings with higgs fields . at the same time",
    ", a dirac mass term is necessary .",
    "therefore , we at least need to introduce two doublets .",
    "moreover , to avoid explicit breaking of the custodial @xmath167 , we must at least introduce two singlets .",
    "the mass matrices of the fermionic charged exotics can always be written in the form of eq .",
    "( [ fermionmass ] ) .",
    "hence , the discussions for the correction to higgs to di - photon decay rate made in sec .",
    "v are in general applicable .",
    "the second benchmark is a very special case in which a charged scalar can do the job .",
    "another similar example in this class is the light stau scenario in the mssm  @xcite .",
    "we see that , due to the constraints from the ewpt , a certain amount of fine tuning is unavoidable in models with an enhanced @xmath38 effective coupling .",
    "this implies that if such an enhancement is confirmed , it would point us to a new direction of model building not completely guided by the reduction of such fine - tuning .",
    "if only the @xmath129 signal rate is enhanced while the other ones are not modified , the new exotic states will carry the ew quantum numbers only .",
    "their collider signals are similar to that of the ew - ino and the slepton .",
    "hence , it would be challenging to search , unless they are part of a long decay chain starting with some colored states .    *",

    "<S> the atlas and cms collaborations have announced discovery of a @xmath0 gev higgs boson , after a combined analysis of the di - photon and @xmath1 search channels . </S>",
    "<S> this observation has significant impact on low - energy supersymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> first , some fine - tuning is necessary to accommodate such a higgs mass in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) because the tree - level mass of the sm - like higgs boson in the mssm is relatively small . </S>",
    "<S> we study the possibility of lifting the mass of the sm - like higgs boson by non - decoupling d - term from an additional @xmath2 gauge symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we focus on a gauged peccei - quinn symmetry which can also be related to a possible solution of the @xmath3 problem in the mssm . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the measurement of the mass of the higgs , the data also reveals a tantalizing hint of a significantly enhanced di - photon signal rate , @xmath4 and @xmath5 times of the sm prediction in the cms and atlas experiments , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that such an enhancement can be accommodated in this mssm extension . </S>",
    "<S> anomaly cancellation requires the introduction of charged exotics . </S>",
    "<S> if some of them happen to be light and have sizable coupling to the sm - like higgs boson , the di - photon signal rate can be enhanced significantly . </S>",
    "<S> ew precision measurements provide stringent constraints on this model . taking these into account , </S>",
    "<S> we identify two benchmark scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that they are representative of large classes of viable models beyond our current example which can consistently enhance the higgs to di - photon rate . </S>",
    "<S> we also comment on possible signals of such light exotics at the lhc . </S>"
