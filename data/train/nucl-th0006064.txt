    "radiative capture of deuterons on alpha particles is the only process by which @xmath6li is produced in standard primordial nucleosynthesis models @xcite . because the low - energy cross section for this process is so small ( @xmath10 nb )",
    ", it has long been held that no measurable amount of @xmath6li can be made in big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) without recourse to exotic physics ( baryon - inhomogeneous scenarios , hadronically - evaporating black holes , etc . ) .",
    "however , there has been new interest in @xmath6li as a cosmological probe in recent years , for two reasons .",
    "first , @xmath6li is more sensitive to destruction in stars than is @xmath11li .",
    "there has consequently been an attempt to set limits on @xmath11li depletion in halo stars by determining how much @xmath6li they have destroyed over their lifetimes .",
    "second , the sensitivity of searches for @xmath6li has been increasing as a result , so that there are now two claimed detections in metal - poor halo stars , and two more detections in disk stars @xcite .",
    "the explanation of these data in terms of chemical - evolution models remains an open question @xcite .",
    "they are presently at a level exceeding even optimistic estimates of how much @xmath6li could have been made in standard bbn @xcite , and the observed @xmath6li is believed to have been created in interactions between cosmic rays and the interstellar medium .",
    "however , it remains interesting from the point of view of understanding these observations to remove as many remaining uncertainties as possible from the standard scenario .",
    "the main such uncertainty arising in the standard bbn calculation is the cross section for @xmath0 .    at the same time ,",
    "electroweak processes in light nuclei are interesting from the point of view of few - body nuclear physics .",
    "the advent of realistic two- and three - nucleon potentials has enabled calculation of nuclear wave functions and energy observables of systems with up to @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "calculation of electroweak observables allows both comparison of these wave functions with experiment ( _ e.g. _ , electron scattering form factors @xcite ) , and estimates of effects not observable in the laboratory ( _ e.g. _ , weak capture cross sections @xcite ) .",
    "the radiative capture of deuterons on alpha particles provides both kinds of opportunities : there are data on the direct process at 700 kev ( all energies are in center of mass ) and above @xcite , and there are indirect data from coulomb breakup experiments corresponding to 70400 kev @xcite .",
    "there is also a need for extrapolation to lower energies for application to nucleosynthesis .",
    "the @xmath13 capture problem is made even more interesting by the fact that @xmath14- and @xmath15-wave captures are strongly inhibited by quasi - orthogonality between the initial and final states and by an isospin selection rule , respectively . as a result",
    ", the dominant process in all experiments performed to date has been electric quadrupole ( @xmath3 ) capture from @xmath16-wave scattering states .",
    "the small remaining @xmath4 contribution from @xmath15-wave initial states has been observed at about 2 mev , but its magnitude has not been successfully explained by theoretical treatments ; it is generally expected to contribute half of the cross section at 100 kev .",
    "the @xmath14-wave capture induced by @xmath5 has been neglected in most calculations because of the quasi - orthogonality mentioned above , which makes the associated matrix element identically zero in two - body treatments of the process .",
    "the energy dependences of the various capture mechanisms ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) are such that even @xmath4 and @xmath5 captures with small amplitudes may become important at low ( @xmath17 kev ) energies . low - energy behavior is particularly important for standard bbn : the primordial @xmath6li yield is only sensitive to the capture cross section between 20 and 200 kev , with the strongest sensitivity at 60 kev .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sensitivity ] , where we show the fractional change in 6 yields resulting from changing the cross section over narrow bins in energy . since it is the energy integral of this quantity which determines the sensitivity , and it is shown on a logarithmic axis , the sensitivity function @xmath18 is defined to include a factor of energy so that relative areas may be accurately gauged .",
    "( a more extensive discussion of these functions appears in ref .",
    "the 6 yield is directly proportional to the cross section at the energies indicated by this function , so that an increase in the cross section by a given factor over the whole energy range produces an increase of the 6 yield by the same factor .",
    "we have carried out a calculation of the alpha - deuteron radiative capture cross section , treating it as a six - body problem .",
    "the remainder of this paper describes this calculation , and it is organized as follows : in section [ sec : wave functions ] , we describe wave functions used to compute the cross section . in section [ sec : operators ] , we describe the electromagnetic current operators and the methods used to calculate their matrix elements . in section [ sec : results ] , we describe our results for the cross section , thermal reaction rates and nucleosynthesis yields , and in section [ sec : end ] , we summarize our results and discuss their implications .",
    "the wave functions @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 used in our calculation are the ground states derived from the argonne @xmath1 two - nucleon  @xcite and urbana ix  @xcite three - nucleon potentials , henceforth denoted as the av18/uix model .",
    "the deuteron wave function is a direct numerical solution , while the variational monte carlo technique described in refs .",

    "@xcite . here",
    "we take them to be the same as in 4 , except that the @xmath59 are forced to go to zero at large distance by multiplying in a cutoff factor , @xmath60\\big]/\\big[1+{\\rm exp}[(r - r_u)/a_u]\\big]$ ] , with @xmath61 and @xmath62 as variational parameters .",

    "these choices for @xmath64 , @xmath63 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 guarantee that when the two p - shell particles are far from the s - shell core , the overall wave function factorizes as : @xmath75 ^ 2 \\psi_{\\alpha } \\psi_d \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the variational 4 wave function and @xmath77 is ( almost ) the exact deuteron wave function .",
    "the single - particle functions @xmath78 describe correlations between the s - shell core and the p - shell nucleons , and have been taken in previous work  @xcite to be solutions of a radial schrdinger equation for a woods - saxon potential and unit angular momentum , with energy and woods - saxon parameters determined variationally .",
    "it is important for low - energy radiative captures that these functions reproduce faithfully the large - separation behavior of the wave function , because the matrix elements receive large contributions at cluster separations greater than 10 fm .",
    "in fact , below 400 kev , more than 15% of the electric quadrupole operator comes from cluster separations beyond 30 fm .",
    "we have therefore modified the 6 wave function for the capture calculation to enforce cluster - like behavior when the two p - shell nucleons are both far from the s - shell core .    in general , for light p - shell nuclei with an asymptotic two - cluster structure , such as @xmath13 in 6 or @xmath79 in @xmath11li , we want the large separation behavior to be @xmath80^n \\propto w_{km}(2\\gamma r)/r,\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the whittaker function for bound - state wave functions in a coulomb potential ( see below ) and @xmath82 is the number of p - shell nucleons . we achieve this by solving the equation @xmath83 r\\phi^{ls}_{p}(r ) = 0,\\ ] ] with @xmath84 , @xmath85 the reduced mass of one nucleon against four , and @xmath86 a parametrized woods - saxon potential plus coulomb term : @xmath87 } + \\frac{2(z-2)}{n } \\frac{e^2}{r } f(r ) \\ .\\ ] ] here @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 are variational parameters , @xmath91 is the average charge of a p - shell nucleon , and f(r ) is a form factor obtained by folding @xmath2 and proton charge distributions together .",

    "nevertheless , the energy of the 6 ground state is variationally improved @xmath108 mev by including such a component in the wave function , so we set the asymptotic behavior of @xmath109 to a binding energy of 3.70 mev , which is the threshold for @xmath110 breakup .    in refs .",
    "@xcite the @xmath111 three - body correlation of eq.([eqn : jastrow ] ) was a valuable and inexpensive improvement to the trial function , but no @xmath112 or @xmath113 correlations could be found that were of any benefit .",

    "it effectively alters the central pair correlation between the two p - shell nucleons from their asymptotic , deuteron - like form to be more like the pair correlations within the s - shell when the two particles are close to the core .",

    "the @xmath118 gives improved binding compared to @xmath117 in both 4 and 6 , but is significantly more expensive to construct because of the numerical derivatives required for the spin - orbit correlations . in the case of an energy calculation",

    "unfortunately , because the variational 6 energy is not below that of separated alpha and deuteron clusters , it is possible to lower the energy significantly by making the wave function more and more diffuse . therefore , the variational parameters were constrained to give a reasonable rms radius , as seen in table  [ tab : energy ] .",

    "our scattering wave function is built from the alpha and deuteron ground - state wave fuctions , @xmath156 and @xmath157 ( where @xmath22 denotes the deuteron spin projection ) , from a nucleon pair correlation operator @xmath158 , and from an intercluster scalar correlation @xmath159 .",

    "it takes into account , in an approximate way , the distortions introduced in each cluster by the interactions with the particles in the other cluster , and becomes the identity operator as particle separations become large .",
    "the intercluster correlation @xmath162 is a two - body radial wave function describing alpha - deuteron scattering as the scattering of two point particles .",
    "it is generated from a schrdinger equation , with the potential chosen to reproduce the results of phase - shift analyses of alpha - deuteron scattering data in the two - body model .",
    "several such potentials exist in the literature , and we saw no need to re - fit the data .",
    "the potentials which we have applied to this study are the potentials of kukulin and pomerantsev , refs .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter , `` kp i '' and `` kp ii '' , respectively ) , and the potential of langanke , ref .",
    "because the potential of langanke was produced for the slightly different problem of describing the @xmath13 system in the resonating group method , it required modification to match our purposes .",
    "this consisted of a small adjustment to the woods - saxon radius to reproduce the energy of the @xmath163 resonance derived from electron scattering , 711 kev .",
    "the most important difference between these potentials , which give very similar cross sections in our calculations , is that the kp potentials were fitted to the phase shifts in the odd and even partial waves separately , to produce the expected parity - dependent potential .",
    "the work by langanke was concerned only with even partial waves , and did not fit the odd partial waves , although it provides a fair qualitative description of the @xmath15-wave phase shifts at low energy .",
    "the potentials are very similar to each other in form .",
    "all of the potentials used contain both central and spin - orbit terms , and the spin - orbit force in the even partial waves is well - constrained by the spacing of the @xmath16-wave scattering resonances . while a tensor component could in principle be derived to reproduce the ground - state quadrupole moment ( assuming total alpha - deuteron cluster parentage of the ground state ) , its effect on the scattering data is too small to support deriving it from the scattering phase shifts .",
    "( a more ambitious approach to derive a tensor interaction would involve computing energies at fixed separation between the @xmath2 and @xmath155 clusters and varying the deuteron orientation ; however , we have not pursued such an approach here . )",
    "coupling to other ( _ e.g. , _ cluster breakup ) channels has also been neglected ; this is well - justified below the @xmath164 and @xmath165 thresholds at 3.12 and 4.20 mev , respectively .",
    "we note that although the kp potentials and the langanke potential all reproduce the scattering phase shifts very well , and they produce very similar ground - state wave functions at small cluster separation , the ground - state binding of the kp ii potential is too large by almost a factor of two .",
    "all of the potentials we used to generate @xmath166 are deep potentials with a forbidden zero - node state .",
    "they produce the expected one - node structure of the ground - state alpha - deuteron wave function required by the pauli principle , as illustrated by our @xmath131 functions in fig.[fig : rls ] , and enforce ( by orthogonality to the forbidden state ) the most important consequences of the pauli principle for @xmath166 .",
    "a complication arises from the phenomenological treatment of the initial state . in reality , the ground - state and @xmath14-wave scattering - state wave functions are orthogonal , because they are different eigenstates of the same ( @xmath167 ) potential . because our calculation does not generate them explicitly as such",
    ", our ground state and @xmath14-wave scattering states are not necessarily orthogonal . for purposes of our capture calculation , this has the effect of generating spurious contributions to the @xmath5 transition operator . for @xmath14-wave captures ,",
    "we have modified the initial state to ensure orthogonality with the ground state .",

    "this procedure reduced the @xmath5 contribution to our computed cross sections by more than a factor of 10 , roughly to the level of monte carlo sampling noise .",

    "most other models have also arrived at @xmath4 cross sections that are too large relative to these data .",
    "a new aspect of our calculation is that the largest contribution is calculated from the nucleon - nucleon potentials as a relativistic center - of - mass correction .",
    "this corresponds closely to inserting measured cluster masses by hand in simpler models , as indicated by the fact that virtually identical ( within 50% ) results for the lwac term are obtained from our six - body model and from a simple capture model using the same cluster potential , but with laboratory alpha and deuteron masses introduced . in fig .",
    "[ fig : e1 ] , the top curve is the total @xmath4 @xmath14 factor ( arising mainly from the center - of - energy correction ) , and the other curves indicate the @xmath14 factors that would result from various small terms in the e1 operator individually .",

    "the @xmath5 strength is expected to be generally very small , since it is zero by orthogonality arguments in a two - body model . however , at very low energy , any @xmath14-wave contribution present may be expected to dominate the total cross section , and many - body wave functions can ( in principle ) provide small pieces of the final - state wave function which can be reached in such a transition .",
    "such an effect is present in neutron captures on the deuteron and on @xmath264he .",
    "the presence of a nonzero @xmath5 contribution in our calculation raises two questions : to what extent is it a product of our choice of wave functions , and how will the presence of meson exchange currents ( mec ) , which is a factor - of - ten correction for the @xmath5 cross section in @xmath265 , affect our result ?",
    "the answer to the first question lies in the discussion of orthogonalization at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : wave functions ] and in fig .",
    "[ fig : breakdown ] ; orthogonal ground and scattering states produce much smaller @xmath5 contributions than non - orthogonalized states , and the remaining @xmath5 contribution is very sensitive to the choice of phenomenological scattering potentials , suggesting a near - cancellation that ought to be exact .",
    "the second question is less important than it may appear at first glance .",
    "the large relative mec contributions to neutron captures on light nuclei typically arise from the _ isovector _ part of the @xmath5 operator .",
    "the @xmath13 capture process is isoscalar ; the isoscalar mec operator is both significantly smaller than the corresponding isovector operator , and quantitatively less certain in magnitude .",
    "we have therefore neglected mec contributions to the m1 operator .",
    "only electric multipoles contribute to coulomb breakup , so the discrepancy between our results and the indirect data ( circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : crsec ] ) is not the result of omitting mec .    to compare our results with those obtained in a simpler model , we have also computed @xmath13 capture by treating the two clusters as point particles , and the ground state as an @xmath14-wave bound state of these two clusters .",
    "we used the modified langanke potential , described above , to compute both states . with this potential ,",
    "the 6 ground state energy is 0.07 mev too high , and this affects the energy dependence of the cross section . the asymptotic normalization of the wave function , which sets the scale for the nonresonant cross section , depends in any model on the detailed short - range behavior of the ground state , and is larger for this model than for our six - body 6 ground state .",
    "while the 711 kev resonance is equally well - reproduced in strength and width by both two - body and six - body models , the total cross sections away from resonance are as much as 16% smaller in the six - body model .",
    "the simple model also yields an @xmath4 strength which is greater by about 30% at 3 mev .",
    "the source of the greater @xmath4 strength is an interplay between the differing asymptotic normalizations , the treatment of the center - of - energy correction ( treated in the simple model by using laboratory values of alpha and deuteron masses ) , and differences in the sizes of lwa2 and lwab terms .",
    "we have also calculated thermally - averaged reaction rates suitable for use in astrophysical calculations .",
    "we integrate from 0.1 kev to 10 mev at temperatures from @xmath266 k to @xmath267 k to produce the quantity @xmath268 customarily used in reaction network calculations .",
    "our result , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rate ] , is as much as 40% larger than previous estimates over a wide range of temperatures .",
    "the sources of these differences are not clear .",
    "they probably arise from several specific details of the capture models used , which have been normalized to the data using assumptions about the relative roles of the @xmath4 and @xmath3 components to produce the rates recommended in compilations .",
    "the total cross sections we have computed compare favorably with the data in the region from the @xmath163 resonance to 3 mev .",
    "this reflects mainly a combination of reasonable fits of the scattering states to experimental phase shifts , and reasonable reproduction of the asymptotic behavior of the @xmath6li ground state in the @xmath14-wave @xmath269 channel .",
    "our calculation of the @xmath4 cross section from the relativistic center - of - energy correction , and examination of several smaller corrections , is new ; however , like all other models not actually scaled to the laboratory data , it is higher than the data . in our calculation , the @xmath4 transition contributes just under 70% of the total cross section at 50 kev",
    ".    a very large cross section for alpha - deuteron capture would be of some interest for cosmology , since it would allow significant production of 6 in the big bang .",
    "however , we find that big - bang nucleosynthesis calculations using our new cross sections can produce 6 at a maximum level of 0.000 60 relative to @xmath11li , or 6/h=@xmath270 .",
    "the maximum occurs at a baryon / photon ratio of @xmath271 , at the low end of the range of possible values suggested by other light - element abundances . at the higher baryon / photon ratio of @xmath272 suggested by recent extragalactic deuterium abundance measurements ,",
    "there is a factor of three less 6 , but because of the increasing @xmath11li production , 6/@xmath11li = 0.000 07 .",
    "since the abundance ratio found in low - metallicity halo stars so far is in the vicinity of 6/@xmath11li = 0.05 , it seems very unlikely that standard big - bang nucleosynthesis could account for observed abundances .",
    "it should be kept in mind that non - standard models not relying solely on the alpha - deuteron capture mechanism could , in principle , produce interesting amounts of 6 @xcite .    in the future we expect to make several improvements on the present work .",
    "while the vmc wave functions for the s - shell nuclei give energies within 2% of the experimental value , the trial functions for p - shell nuclei are not as good .",
    "it should be worthwhile to try the more accurate gfmc ground states for the p - shell nuclei and calculate mixed estimates of the transition operators  @xcite .",
    "eventually one would also like to construct the scattering states with the gfmc method , but this will be considerably more difficult .",
    "further , new three - body potentials that give a better fit to the energies of the light p - shell nuclei are currently under development  @xcite and should improve both the vmc and gfmc results .",
    "an important aspect of these studies will continue to be the construction of ground states that have the proper asymptotic cluster behavior .",
    "this must be imposed in the variational trial function , because the gfmc algorithm is not sensitive to the tail of the wave function and will not be able to correct for any failures .",
