    "the links between geometric objects and angular momenta in quantum mechanics have been observed in many ways since long ago @xcite , and the properties of some invariants which can be obtained from @xmath0 representations have been used by ponzano and regge to build a quantum gravity model in three dimensions @xcite . in the pr model a partition function is defined for a given 3-dimensional simplicial complex ( it has been proved later , by deforming @xmath0 to a quantum group @xcite , that the partition function depends only on the topology of the manifold which is triangulated by the simplicial complex ) by means of the following procedure : to each _ edge _ of the complex is associated a spin @xmath1 ( that is , an irreducible unitary @xmath0 representation , characterized only by its dimension @xmath2 ) .",
    "the `` exponential of the action '' in such a configuration is a suitable product of the the @xmath3-symbols associated to the 3-simplices and the partition function is obtained by taking the sum of this products over the possible associations of spins to the edges .",
    "this construction has been inspired by the following property : ruling out the trivial 1-dimensional representations , the @xmath3-symbols are zero unless the values of the representations spins can represent lenghts of the edges of a tetrahedron ( i.e. the triangular inequality is satisfied in each face ) , which is , in a loose sense , the `` building block '' of 3-dimensional simplicial complexes .",
    "the main feature of the pr model is that the partition function is defined in a purely algebraic fashion , and in the classical limit ( i.e. when the spins @xmath1 are large ) it resembles the feynman path integral for ( euclidean ) general relativity in 3-dimensions : one could say that there is a classical geometry ( that defined by the edges lengths ) obeying a quantum dynamics .",
    "in this paper we highlight another link between tetrahedra and @xmath0 by associating to each _ face _ of the tetrahedron an irreducible unitary @xmath0 representation .",
    "this construction is , in some sense , dual to that of pr and , after the imposition of a `` closure '' condition analogous to the `` triangular inequality '' condition seen above , it leads to the notion of a _ quantum geometry _ by itself . in section [ quantet ]",
    "we introduce the hilbert space of the quantum tetrahedron and we discuss some of its properties .",
    "we shall see that , due to the noncommutativity of some operators simultaneously needed in order to define a classical geometry , an uncertainty relation arises ; it is however possible to obtain some geometrical informations by taking the mean values of the relevant operators and we have computed such `` mean geometries '' in some simple cases .    a strict connection exists between quantum tetrahedra and 4-valent vertices of @xmath0 spin networks . since their first appearence in the pioneering penrose s",
    "work @xcite , aiming to a combinatorial description of some kind of quantum geometry , spin networks have found applications in many branches of mathematics and physics ; in particular , it is now a firm result that spin networks embedded into a manifold are `` the skeleton '' of the kinematical structure of quantum gauge theories with compact gauge groups @xcite .",
    "when diffeomorphism invariance holds , as is the case in the loop quantization of ( euclidean , if one wants a compact gauge group ) general relativity using ashtekar connection variables @xcite , one must factor out all the classes of `` equivalent '' spin networks under diffeomorphisms ( i.e. one must solve the `` momentum constraints '' which arise in the corresponding functional quantization ) , obtaining what are usually called @xmath4-knots .",
    "one of the main difficulties with this approach is the rather `` knotted '' structure of the set of arbitrary @xmath4-knots , manifesting itself e.g. in the fact that this set is not countable @xcite .    in section [ gauge ] , we propose a model of quantum gauge theory in which the only allowed spin networks are the simplest they could be in order to be nontrivial : they are defined on the ( 4-valent ) dual graphs @xmath5 of the simplicial complexes @xmath6 which triangulate the manifold .",
    "we shall see in this way that both gauge- and diff - invariances are obtained , and that the resulting structure is purely combinatorial .",
    "( we must remark that , while completing this work , we came across a similar construction of combinatorial quantum gauge theory using simplicial complexes , appeared in recent works of other authors @xcite . )",
    "we conclude with some speculations about the possible links between our model and some `` quantum version '' of regge calculus @xcite and its possible applications to the problem of quantum gravity .",
    "a tetrahedron can be understood as the convex envelope of four points in 3-dimensional euclidean space @xmath7 . with reference to figure 1 ,",
    "we see that a triad @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 of independent vectors ( nine numbers ) defines completely the tetrahedron . if one is interested only in its properties independently from its space orientation ( we may consider these properties as defining the `` geometry '' of the tetrahedron ) , the relevant independent parameters , due to the factorization of the rotation group , become six and can be taken to be @xmath11 given these six numbers , it is possible to reproduce the original tetrahedron apart from its original orientation in space .",
    "( the upper bound in this hierarchy is given by the twelve cartesian coordinates of the four points and the degrees of freedom match : three parameters for the translations group plus three for that of rotations plus six of `` geometry '' . )",
    "let us now consider the _",
    "vectorial areas _ of the tetrahedron in figure 1 , given by @xmath12 the last equation , which is simply the `` closure '' condition ( in the form @xmath13 it holds for every closed surface @xmath14 ) , shows that only three of these vectors , which will be called , somewhat improperly , _",
    "normals _ , are independent ; it seems now natural to see whether the tetrahedron s geometry can be reconstructed from the normals rather than from the edges .",
    "the independent parameters must belong to the set of the invariants which can be obtained from @xmath15 , that is , their squares ( four times the squared areas of the faces ) and their mutual scalar products ( properly normalized , the cosines of the dihedral angles associated to the edges ) .",
    "we should add to these quantities the triple product @xmath16 , which is also invariant ; this quantity will play a rle later .    in all we have ten numbers which , owing to eqn .",
    "( [ nfond ] ) , are not independent ; by taking the scalar products of this expression with the normals we obtain four independent equations : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( the square in the first symbol is part of the notation ) .",
    "it is easy to verify that independent parameters are the four squared areas @xmath20 and two dihedral angles associated to edges sharing a vertex , e.g. @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the relations between couples of angles associated to opposite edges are the following : @xmath23 and eqn .",

    "this system , provided that some geometrical non - holonomic restrictions such as @xmath27 and @xmath28 are satisfied , has two sets of opposite real roots ; the correct solution is clearly the one with @xmath29 , while the other one can be imagined to correspond to purely imaginary edges ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "to summarize , the values of the areas and of two `` non opposite '' dihedral angles actually define completely the tetrahedron s geometry .",
    "as we have mentioned in the introduction , let us now associate to the four faces of the tetrahedron four unitary irreducible representations of @xmath0 acting on the spaces @xmath31 ( @xmath32 is the spin of the representation , while @xmath33 labels the faces ) .",
    "the `` quantum versions '' of the vectorial areas are assumed to be the generators @xmath34 acting on the tensor product @xmath35 in the pr model , the spins associated to the edges have to obey triangular inequalities for each face ; in our case , we must impose the quantum normals to obey the closure condition ( [ nfond ] ) : @xmath36 that is , the space @xmath37 must contain a subspace @xmath38 of spherically symmetric vectors .",
    "in such a space the operators @xmath39 are well defined and they obey a set of operatorial equations identical to ( [ invnfond]-[finfond ] ) . if , in order not to single out particular values of the @xmath32 s , we consider now the orthogonal sum @xmath40 where @xmath41 runs over the set of _ ordered _",
    "4-tuples of integers or half - integers such that @xmath42 is nonempty , the operators @xmath43 and @xmath44 can be defined in @xmath45 as hermitean operators , and , since they are blockwise diagonal , they continue to obey equations ( [ invnfond]-[finfond ] ) ; we thus may say that @xmath43 and @xmath44 , acting on @xmath45 , define a _",
    "quantum tetrahedron_. + condition ( [ fund ] ) may be considered to implement in this context the fact that the set of the faces must form the boundary of the tetrahedron and as such it must have no boundary . the topological principle that `` the boundary of a boundary is zero '' usually manifests itself in physics via the stokes theorem as an `` inducer '' of automatic consevation laws @xcite ; in our case it induces `` automatic '' invariance under rotations imposed onto the full tetrahedron : the faces by themselves transform non trivially ( since they carry a non - zero spin ) , but the quantum tetrahedron is invariant ( the spin `` created inside it '' must be zero ) . as we shall see in section [ gauge ] this fact is in intimate connection with gauge invariance .",
    "it is worth noting that , since e.g. @xmath46 is easily seen to be a complete set of commuting operators in @xmath45 , the set of operators which is needed in order to determine the geometry is non - commuting . indeed , if we take @xmath47 as the last parameter we find @xmath48=-{\\rm i}\\vec{\\bf j}{}_1\\cdot\\vec{\\bf j}{}_2 \\times\\vec{\\bf j}{}_3\\equiv { \\rm i}{\\bf u } , \\label{relcom}\\ ] ] where the r.h.s .",
    ", being a scalar quantity , is well defined in @xmath45 ( the @xmath43 are proportional to the identity in each subspace @xmath42 , therefore they commute with all the @xmath44 ) .",
    "this equation implies the uncertainty relation @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the mean square deviation of @xmath44 .      despite its non symmetric definition ,",
    "the operator @xmath51 is , except for the sign , unique : if we take as independent variables e.g. @xmath52 and @xmath53 , the commutator is then @xmath54=-{\\rm i}\\vec{\\bf j}{}_1\\cdot \\vec{\\bf j}{}_2\\times\\vec{\\bf j}{}_4=-{\\rm i}{\\bf u},\\ ] ] where the last equality follows from the fundamental equation ( [ fund ] ) , and a little reflection shows that @xmath55 is the same of @xmath51 ( recall the definition ( [ relcom ] ) with the minus sign ) if and only if @xmath56 are the first three elements of an odd permutation of @xmath57 , while it is opposite if the permutation is even .",
    "the latter property has an interesting connection with the notion of parity .",
    "the description we have given from the beginning of the geometry of tetrahedra has skipped the issue of parity : from the _ numerical values _",
    "alone of the parameters that we have chosen , it is by no means possible to distinguish one tetrahedron from its @xmath58-transformed : both the parameters",
    "( [ indipp ] ) and @xmath59 are invariant under the tranformation @xmath60 . in the description in term of the edges",
    "this ambiguity can be resolved by the choice of a sign for @xmath61 ( @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the _ volume _ of the tetrahedron ) : it is positive if the triad is right - handed , and negative if it is left handed .",
    "essentially the same thing can be done in the description in terms of the normals , but there is a subtlety .",
    "classically , the triple product of the normals @xmath64 , as defined in ( [ norms]-[nfond ] ) , is given by @xmath65 and it is always negative , whatever @xmath66 is right or left handed ; a closer inspection on the geometrical settings reveals however that they point outwards the tetrahedron only in the first case .",
    "the reason for this is that the vector products are defined in terms of the initial basis @xmath66 _ which we have supposed right handed _ and to mantain the geometrical settings we must change sign to all the normals , with the result that the l.h.s . of eqn .",
    "( [ ipovol ] ) also changes its sign : we may distinguish the original and its @xmath58-transformed tetrahedra by means of the sign we give to @xmath16 .",
    "this prescription , however , requires an additional information : an ordering modulo even permutations of the normals .",
    "indeed if the normals are non ordered it is not possible to decide wether a given triplet should be left- or right - handed .",
    "these considerations about the link between parity and permutations can be transposed in the quantum context quite as they stand . under the assumption ( to be justified later ) that @xmath51 is nondegenerate in each subspace @xmath67 , an orthonormal basis in @xmath45 is also provided by the set @xmath68 of simultaneous eigenvectors of @xmath43 and @xmath51 ( @xmath69 is an index that labels the eigenvalues of @xmath51 in @xmath38 ) .",
    "since the definition of the space @xmath38 is globally insensitive to permutations of @xmath70 , it is clear that @xmath51 has the same eigenvalues in @xmath42 and in @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is a permutation of four elements , and that they are symmetric with respect to zero .",
    "the index @xmath69 that labels the eigenvalues of @xmath51 in the subspaces @xmath42 can thus be chosen to run from to @xmath73 to @xmath74 with integer steps , where @xmath75 is the dimension of @xmath42 , in such a way that the corresponding eigenvalues obey @xmath76 if we define in @xmath45 a representation of the group @xmath77 ( permutations of four elements ) in the following way @xmath78 if @xmath72 is an even ( odd ) permutation , we see that the situation is exactly the same found for the classical geometry : we may define parity on the quantum tetrahedron s hilbert space in the following way @xmath79 so that we have @xmath80 but without an ordering modulo even permutations of the faces we can not decide if `` positive @xmath81 '' means right- or left - handed , since @xmath82      the spaces @xmath38 are all finite - dimensional , and their dimension is given by the espression @xmath83 since permutations are taken into account by the equivalence @xmath84 , we may assume @xmath85 , and we have @xmath86 the maximum dimensionality @xmath87 is achieved by the maximally symmetric space @xmath88 , while the minimum @xmath89 is achieved when any of the @xmath90 is zero or it holds @xmath91 ( the necessary condition for @xmath38 to be non empty is @xmath92 ) .",
    "+ 1-dimensional spaces are peculiar for the following reason : on those spaces @xmath51 , being traceless , is necessarily zero and all the parameters needed to define the geometry have a definite value , so that the geometry is `` classical '' .",
    "however , difficulties arise if one tries to interpret the results in a classical way ; for instance , when @xmath93 the condition",
    "@xmath91 corresponds to the `` quantum sum '' of three parallel vectors , that is , to a `` flat '' ( contained in a 2-dimensional plane ) tetrahedron , while the quantum geometry does not lead to this description , since e.g. the sum of the first three areas should be equal to the fourth , and one can check that it is not the case . in the generic case ,",
    "( [ indet ] ) implies that the geometry of the quantum tetrahedron can not be defined exactly , because of `` quantum fluctuations '' : we can continue to speak about geometry only `` in the mean '' .",

    "( [ mtrell ] ) of the identity in @xmath38 in the form @xmath110 produces the final result @xmath111 where the scalar products are given by the expression @xcite @xmath112 in order to verify if , in practice , the exposed construction produces consistent results , we have computed in some simple cases the quantum geometries of the quantum tetrahedron via the following procedure :    * given the values @xmath94 of the four external spins , we have computed the eigenvalues and the ( normalized ) eigenvectors of the operator @xmath51 in @xmath38 ; * we have then computed , using the mean values of @xmath52 and @xmath47 in each eigenstate of @xmath51 ( the choice of these states is motivated by reasons of symmetry ) , the `` mean '' geometry in the form of the `` mean '' edges squared lenghts .",
    "the results obtained are shown in the appendix .",
    "from the few cases explored we can infer some general properties of the mean geometries .",
    "firstly , it seems that actually @xmath51 is non - degenerate in @xmath42 ; secondly , the mean geometries corresponding to states with opposite eigenvalues of @xmath51 are the same . furthermore , when there are four or three equal values of the external spins , corresponding respectively to equilateral tetrahedra and right pyramids with equilateral basis , the mean geometries do not depend on the eigenvalues , but this `` degeneration '' disappears for less symmetric cases . + the case ( 1/2,1/2,1/2,1/2 ) , which in some sense is the first nontrivial one , is suggestive for the following reason . since the @xmath113 must have the dimensions of an area , we may write @xmath114 where l is a constant with the dimensions of a lenght , and we see that the mean length is exactly the unit lenght l.    in order to have a better understanding of these results it seems necessary to have a consistent interpretation of the operator @xmath51 . as shown in eqn .",
    "( [ ipovol ] ) , classically , the triple product @xmath16 is ( minus ) 36 times the squared _ volume _ of the tetrahedron . for this reason",
    "the operator @xmath115 could be interpreted as ( a multiple of ) the quantum analogue of the volume .",
    "it is not obvious , however , that this identification is consistent , because ( [ ipovol ] ) has been derived from eqns .",
    "( [ norms]-[nfond ] ) assuming that the edges @xmath116 commute .",
    "the fact that in the highly symmetric cases the mean geometry does not depend on @xmath69 , suggests that @xmath51 could be interpreted as an object with higher dimensional nature , as in minkowski space an invariant under rotations may have different 4-dimensional origins .",
    "indeed , in the cases explored , we have noticed that the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath51 is always less than @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the volume computed using the mean geometry .",
    "this property may be used to introduce the concept of a timelike direction .",
    "( we discuss the timelike case because it is more intriguing , but if one wishes the dimension more can be imagined as spacelike ; it does not change much . )",
    "if we imagine the tetrahedron as imbedded in 3 + 1 minkowski spacetime , the requirement that all the edges are spacelike is equivalent to the requirement that the 4-dimensional `` normal '' of the tetrahedron ( i.e. the 1-form @xmath119 dual to the trivector @xmath120 ) lies inside the light cone . assuming a privileged time axis , the immersion properties of our spacelike tetrahedron can be characterized ( in an invariant way under spatial rotations ) by the `` angle '' formed by its 4-velocity and the time axis , or , simply , by its velocity . notice that , due to the condition that @xmath119 lies inside the light cone , the velocity is necessarily less than one ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "+ we than see that , if the inequality @xmath122 is actually obeyed in all cases , it would be natural to interpret @xmath123 as some power of the `` @xmath124 '' of the quantum tetrahedron with respect to some `` background '' rest frame . in this light ,",
    "the symmetry @xmath84 could be also interpreted as the possibility for @xmath119 to lie inside the future or past light cone .",
    "it is clear that if one considers only _ one _ quantum tetrahedron , the possibility of defining its velocity with respect to nothing else , can be of little use ; one the other hand , if we collect togheter some quantum tetrahedra joining them by the faces ( i.e. we consider suitable tensor products of @xmath45 with itself ) , it may be then possible to define `` spatial slices '' of 4-dimensional `` quantum simplicial complexes '' . in the next section",
    "we will try to formalize in a general framework these ideas .",
    "the connection between quantum tetrahedra and the spin networks used in the loop representation framework of quantum general relativity is fairly obvious : condition ( [ fund ] ) , translated in terms of the representations spins , is nothing but the compatibility condition for the spins of the edges adjacent to a 4-valent vertex .",
    "furthermore the ( eigen)values of the areas of the faces are one half those obtained in the loop representation framework and @xmath115 is @xmath125 times the volume operator of that model , restricted to 4-valent vertices ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this analogy can not be pushed farther , because in the loop representation spin networks have vertices whose valence is arbitrary , and for valence different from four it does not seem possible to find a geometric interpretation in terms perhaps of more complicated polyhedra .",
    "anyway , 4-valent vertices seem to play a particular rle for the following conjunct two reasons : first , the volume operator always acts trivially on vertices with valence less than four ; second , diffeomorphism - equivalence classes of embedded spin networks with vertices with valence higher than four are labeled by continuous parameters @xcite , thus failing to have a purely combinatorial structure .    in this section",
    "we shall sketch a model of quantum gauge theory which is a kind of hybrid between the loop representation and lattice gauge theories , and in which the only allowed vertices are 4-valent .",
    "this model is not complete in an essential way , since it lacks a dynamics : all the considerations below are limited to the kinematical structure , but the framework itself seems to suggest how to introduce the concept of a dynamical evolution",
    ". we will return to this point at the end .",
    "the whole construction has been inspired by the following simple observation ( found in @xcite ) : let @xmath6 be a 3-dimensional regge simplicial complex with positive metric ; then the set @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the 1-skeleton of @xmath6 , is ( isomorphic to ) a multiply connected riemann manifold , which we will call a _ regge manifold _",
    ", whose fundamental group is isomorphic to the fundamental group of the 1-graph @xmath5 dual to @xmath6 ( @xmath5 is always 4-valent ) .",
    "this manifold is everywhere _ locally flat _ and the information about its `` curvature '' is contained into a representation of @xmath128 in @xmath129 ( or @xmath0 ) .",
    "+ turning to gauge theories , all the information about the gauge field is contained @xcite into a representation of the group @xmath130 of base - pointed loops in the gauge group @xmath131 , given by the holonomy of the connection ( which can be considered as a lagrangian coordinate for a 3-dimensional theory as well as a canonical coordinate on the phase space of a 4-dimensional one ; the underlying manifold @xmath132 is in both cases 3-dimensional ) .",
    "if however the connection is flat , we remain again with the representations of @xmath133 in @xmath131 .",
    "the idea for what should be called a _",
    "simplicial gauge theory _ is to `` substitute '' the configuration space for a non - flat gauge theory , with the set of flat connections which can be defined over the multiply connected manifolds obtained by triangulating the `` original '' manifold @xmath132 and by removing the 1-skeletons : in this way each configuration is given by a couple @xmath134 , where @xmath6 is a simplicial complex which triangulates @xmath132 and @xmath135 is a representation of @xmath128 in @xmath131 .",
    "intuitively one sees that there is no significant `` loss of configurations '' , as happens when one goes from a non - flat to a flat connection over the _ same _ manifold .",
    "furthermore the configuration space has a far more manageable form : the part that substitutes the local degrees of freedom , that is , the structure of the triangulation , is purely combinatorial . finally , as any reference to @xmath132 is contained in the properties of the simplicial complexes that triangulate it , and is thus of a purely topological nature , diffeomorphism invariance ( or rather covariance ) is , despite the `` lattice - like '' formulation , automatically obtained .",
    "it should be pointed out that this construction is simply meaningless if interpreted in a classical fashion ; in this respect it is not a `` quantized '' model but it has to be `` quantum '' from the beginning .",
    "the space of states should be taken as the set of the functionals over the configuration space ; if the gauge group @xmath131 is compact , and if the set of simplicial complexes triangulating a given manifold is countable ( which is surely the case if @xmath132 is compact ) , this space can be given a natural measure : @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the number of edges of @xmath5 , and @xmath138 is the haar measure for @xmath131 ( the representation @xmath135 is assigned by means of the @xmath139 in 1 - 1 correspondence with the oriented edges of @xmath5 ) .",
    "this measure however is not fully satisfying , because it leaves little space to impose additional relations or constraints to handle issues like the introduction of a dynamical evolution , the refinements of the triangulation and the limit in which one should `` see the continuum '' .",
    "regarding this problem , we are looking for a generalization of the projective techniques used for integration over the gauge groups in continuum gauge theories @xcite , using the fundamental groups of the manifolds @xmath140 ( @xmath141 represents a triangulation of @xmath132 `` isomorphic '' to @xmath6 ) instead of the tame groups .",
    "the main obstacle is that the @xmath5 do not form a group in a trivial way .",
    "+ let us now turn to gauge invariance : in perfect analogy with lattice gauge theories , gauge transformations are defined over each graph of each triangulation by assigning an element @xmath142 to each vertex @xmath143 ; for each edge @xmath144 we have @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the final vertex of @xmath144 and the opposite holds for @xmath147 .",
    "a basis in the space of invariant vectors under gauge transformations is provided ( see @xcite for the proof ) by the spin networks defined over the graphs @xmath5 , of which we recall the definition in the case of an arbitrary ( compact ) group @xmath131 ; to each edge @xmath148 one assigns a unitary irreducible representation @xmath149 of @xmath131 , in such a way that for each vertex @xmath143 the following property is satisfied : let @xmath150 and @xmath151 be the set of the edges having @xmath143 respectively as the final and initial vertex ; then in the set @xmath152 decomposed into a sum of irreducible representations , are contained trivial representations .",
    "a spin network is identified by such an assignment plus a choice of a trivial representation for each vertex .      when the gauge group is @xmath0 , a spin network can be interpreted as a collection of quantum tetrahedra joined by the faces and the concept of a _ simplicial quantum geometry _ for the manifold seems to emerge .",
    "the reason why the `` geometrical content '' of the model has appeared in the @xmath0 case can be explained by means of the mentioned observation about regge manifolds : gauge transformations are , in this context , simply _ frame rotations _ within each tetrahedron , so that there should be no surprise that , by handling invariants under these transformations , one gets geometrical quantities . indeed , our belief that the construction exposed has , for the @xmath0 case ,",
    "more than something to do with some `` quantum version '' of regge calculus has been recently enforced by some observations found in @xcite , where also it is suggested that the natural `` site '' of spin networks in a loop - quantization of regge calculus is the dual graph rather than the 1-skeleton .",
    "another feature of the @xmath0 case is that the space of states is a subset of the space of states of the loop representation of quantum general relativity ( each graph @xmath5 can be imbedded into the manifold by means of a triangulation ) , but , as mentioned in the beginning of this section , it is the subset that behaves , in the sense specified above , better .",
    "the fact that the model provides just _ this _ subset is somewhat gratifying and gives it some mathematical appeal .",
    "a posteriori , one may ask if it is really necessary to have a classical manifold `` in the background '' ; after all , its only rle is to provide some constraints on the combinatorial structure of the simplicial complexes one must consider .",
    "actually , from the point of wiew of consistency , it does not seem to make a lot of difference considering all possible ( perhaps compact ) simplicial complexes in the space of states , so that the model logically decouples from the manifold s concept itself , which , instead , may arise as a suitable `` semiclassical limit '' .",
    "obviously , whether the @xmath0 simplicial gauge theory has something to do with quantum gravity or not , can not be said before the introduction of some kind of dynamics ; regarding this latter point , we think there are two possible ways that can be pursued .",
    "the first one is the introduction of a `` scalar constraint '' to keep track of the fact that there is not a background temporal structure ; if one tries to mimic the form of the scalar constraint of general relativity a problem arises with the definition of an extrinsic curvature : the gauge group being @xmath0 rather than the lorentz group , it is not clear how to introduce the boosts .",
    "one way out could be something analogous to the generalized wick rotation proposed for the ashtekar formalism @xcite ; we think that such a construction could be linked to the property of the operator @xmath51 which we exposed at the end of the last section . the second possibility , maybe closest to the `` simplicial spirit '' , is the definition of transition amplitudes following steps similar to those in @xcite , using perhaps the topological moves that generate the ( classical ) evolution in regge calculus .",
    "this work is part of my graduation thesis and i wish to thank my supervisor enore guadagnini for the attention he dedicated to me during the last year and michele mintchev for his encouragement ; i am also grateful to riccardo giannitrapani for the many helpful discussions we have had throughout the years .",
    "a group - theoretical dimensional extension of the pr(tv ) model , meanwhile appeared in @xcite , seems to confirm some of the speculations of the last unit .",
    "it is argued in @xcite that this model have a chance to reproduce the euclidean einstein - hilbert action in the classical limit .",
    "on the `` minkowskian '' side ( that taking into account causality ) i have to point out that what i called `` second possibility '' above was indeed already contained in @xcite ( i can not explain myself my blindness ) and is used in @xcite to interpret a string worldsheet as a perturbation of _ evolving _",
    "@xmath153 simplicial spin networks , where @xmath153 is any ( quantum ) gauge group .",
    "it is argued in @xcite that the action of such a perturbation with respect to a background which tends ( in a still unprecised sense ) to flat spacetime tends to the spacetime area of the worldsheet .",
