    "occuring in a broad class of natural phenomena metastability has been intensively studied in different research fields ranging from condensed matter to chemical physics , from particle and nuclear physics to cosmology . while the mathematics of the metastable phase in statistical physics was elaborated by langer @xcite forty years ago , the thorough extension of the formalism to the quantum field theory came in the seventies of the last century @xcite .",
    "as the semiclassical approximation is known to be appropriate @xcite to deal with quantum tunneling , the path integral method in the euclidean version @xcite has emerged as the fundamental tool for quantitative theories of the decay rate @xmath1 of a metastable state .",
    "the latter is given in semiclassical theory by    @xmath2 \\label{eq:100}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath3 and @xmath4 depend on the specific shape of the potential .",
    "in the path integral approach , @xmath4 is the euclidean action calculated at the classical path around which the action varies the least while @xmath3 is obtained by summing over the quantum fluctuations paths . in quadratic approximation",
    "the quantum fluctuations are decoupled and their contribution can be evaluated by the theory of the functional determinants which implements the path integral method @xcite .",
    "( [ eq:100 ] ) is formally identical to the tunneling energy in the bistable @xmath5 potential @xcite which admits an instanton @xcite as the classical path interpolating between the two vacua .",
    "the fundamental difference lies however in the fact that the instanton minimizes the euclidean action whereas the classical path in the metastable potential , the bounce , is a saddle point for the action .",
    "hence the bounce time derivative , which is eigenfunction of the quantum fluctuations sturm - liouville operator with zero eigenvalue ( due to time translational invariance ) , is not the ground state .",
    "there must be a negative eigenvalue @xcite in the fluctuation spectrum causing an imaginary contribution to the total partition function .",
    "the decay rate of the false vacuum arises precisely from this negative eigenvalue which , moreover , is unique as the bounce path has one node along the time axis .",
    "while the general formalism of metastability is settled at least in one dimension and in the semiclassical method @xcite , the evaluations of @xmath1 for specific systems are generally based on the langer - coleman approach @xcite which assumes a system with _",
    "infinite size _ @xmath6 and therefore , strictly speaking , holds in the zero temperature limit of the quantum field theory once @xmath6 is taken equal to @xmath7 .",
    "the same formal approach can be used in classical systems to calculate the noise - induced transition rate between locally stable states , for example the domain reversal rate in micromagnets @xcite and the instabilities in metallic nanowires @xcite . in such systems",
    "however the character of the transition between activation regimes crucially depends on the finite spatial extent @xcite , thus quantitative estimates of the kramer escape rate require an extension of the langer - coleman method to the more complex",
    "_ finite size _ case . in quantum tunneling systems ,",
    "the counterpart of the latter is represented by the _",
    "finite t _ quantum regime below the crossover temperature @xmath8 at which thermal activated processes set in . below @xmath8 , the decay rate stems from purely quantum fluctuations effects and the @xmath1 dependence on @xmath0 is governed by the softening of the fluctuation spectrum . to determine this phenomenon with accuracy one has to face the non trivial task of computing fluctuation functional determinants at low but finite @xmath0 @xcite which also includes a knowledge of the negative eigenvalue in the spectrum .",
    "this paper focuses on this issues developing the finite temperature theory of metastability below @xmath8 for the case of a model cubic potential .",
    "in particular , the softening of the fluctuations is analysed quantitatively by means of the jacobi elliptic functions formalism @xcite which has the advantage to monitor the evolution of the system at any @xmath0 , free from approximations regarding the form of the bounce and its fluctuation spectrum .",
    "the explicit equations which determine such softening are provided .",
    "activation effects @xcite are not discussed in this work which assumes a closed system .",
    "metastability in the presence of dissipation has been studied in ref.@xcite .    as in the space - time euclidean path integral",
    "the time is an inverse temperature , the zero @xmath0 theory assumes that the bounce classical motion lasts an _ infinite time _ whereas the finite @xmath0 theory realistically admits that the excursion time for the bounce may be finite .",
    "this consideration permits to derive the family of energy dependent paths which solve the classical equation of motion as shown in section 2 for the cubic potential . in section 3 , using the theory of the functional determinants , i determine analytically and compute the quantum fluctuations contribution to the path integral .",
    "the solution of the lam equation which governs the fluctuation spectrum is presented together with the evaluation of the temperature effects on the lowest lying eigenmodes and their eigenvalues .",
    "section 4 contains the results for the decay rate of the metastable cubic potential and a comparison with the case of the metastable quartic potential .",
    "some final remarks are made in section 5 .",
    "consider a particle of mass @xmath9 in the one dimensional cubic potential :    @xmath10    plotted in fig .",

    "close to @xmath121 , the decay rate of the quartic potential shows the same behavior found in the cubic case as a consequence of the softening of the polynomial fluctuation eigenmode with lowest lying positive eigenvalue .",
    "the semiclassical path integral method has been applied to compute the decay rate of a metastable cubic potential at finite temperature .",
    "i have considered a non dissipative system where the inverse temperature , introduced as the imaginary time of the euclidean path integral , represents a measure of the system _ size_. solving the euler - lagrange equation for the cubic potential i have determined the classical background , the bounce , in terms of jacobi elliptic functions whose energy dependent modulus keeps track of the classical mechanics .",
    "the periodicity property of the elliptic solution sets the fundamental relation between bounce oscillation period and classical energy . as the former varies monotonically with the latter ,",
    "the transition from the quantum to the activated regime is in fact a temperature driven smooth crossover occuring at @xmath204 .",
    "then the quantum regime may cover a broader temperature range in systems with characteristic frequencies larger than the value taken here . in the latter cases",
    "however the quadratic approximation for the quantum fluctuations may become questionable .    in general , the character of this transition in tunneling systems may depend on the form of the potential . for the metastable potential the classical background represented by the bounce has zero topological charge , fulfills periodic boundary conditions and the amplitude of its motion progressively shrinks by increasing @xmath66 . at @xmath8 ,",
    "the bounce degenerates into a point , the constant solution which determines the classical arrhenius factor .",

    "i have obtained a compact expression for the fluctuations contribution to the path integral and computed the renormalization of the fluctuation spectrum due to temperature effects inside the quantum regime .",
    "the overall softening is remarkable : it shows up at about @xmath205 whereas at lower temperatures the predictions of the zero @xmath0 ( infinite time ) theory are accurate .",
    "the polynomial eigenmodes of the spectrum have been analytically determined by solving the stability equation associated to the sturm - liouville differential operator , the lam equation .",
    "the focus on the ground state is justified by the fact that its eigenvalue is negative hence , it is responsible for the decay rate @xmath1 of the metastable potential .",
    "the negative eigenvalue softens considerably by approaching the sphaleron where , in turn , it determines the oscillation period of the classical bounce . also the positive polynomial eigenvalue plays a key role as it even vanishes at the sphaleron and ultimately induces the rapid increase in the inverse determinants ratio .",
    "the explicitly derived equations governing the temperature dependence of the fluctuations may be adapted to specific situations by tuning the potential parameters . for the specific choice of parameters here presented ,",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath27 , the computed @xmath1 starts to increase over the zero @xmath0 decay rate at about @xmath205 and , close to @xmath8 , the peak value is larger by a factor @xmath179 , a sizeable effect . at the crossover the quantum decay process ends and",
    "the arrhenius classical behavior sets in .",
