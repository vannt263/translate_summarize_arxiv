    "in the early 1960s , kasteleyn @xcite and temperley and fisher @xcite studied the classical dimer model ( dm ) defining the statistical - mechanical problem of the covering of a lattice by dimers .",
    "they treated the dm on , for example , the square lattice in the thermodynamic limit , and obtained the partition function to give the extensive entropy of an ensemble of dimer configurations .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the close - packed model defined on planar lattices can be solved exactly by pfaffian techniques @xcite .",
    "the properties of these ensembles were studied in subsequent research .",
    "for example , those defined on bipartite ( non - bipartite ) lattices such as the square ( triangular ) lattice exhibit critical ( off - critical ) behavior @xcite , which are now thought to reflect an existence ( absence ) of the height representations for the dms @xcite . while the relevance of dimers as diatomic molecules adsorbed on a lattice is clear and direct , it can be also related to other degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "for instance , the zero - temperature ising - spin antiferromagnet on a triangular ( villain ) lattice can be related to the dm on a hexagonal ( square ) lattice , where each dimer represents an unsatisfied bond of spins @xcite .",
    "also widely known is the string representation whereby dimer systems under a certain condition can be related to loop gases whose configurations are classified by winding numbers ( see below ) @xcite .",
    "this correspondence has been utilized in discussions of polymer systems @xcite .",
    "more importantly , rokhsar and kivelson introduced quantum dimer models ( qdms ) to describe the valence - bond physics in quantum heisenberg antiferromagnets , where the dimer represents a tightly binding singlet pair of quantum spins @xcite .",
    "these are but a fraction of the examples that show dms having importance in a wide range of research and drawing attention over the years ; in particular , current interest has been mainly focused on exotic phases with topological orders observed in the qdms @xcite .",
    "more recently , blunt et al .",
    "reported on an adsorption experiment of certain rod - like organic molecules on graphite @xcite and explained its relevance to the dm on a hexagonal lattice which includes interactions between neighboring dimers @xcite .",
    "this exhibits the fact that interaction effects in classical dimers are also important from both theoretical and experimental viewpoints @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate an interacting dimer model ( idm ) defined on a square lattice : suppose the lattice constant @xmath1 and let @xmath2 denote the set of lattice sites",

    "[ dimerconf](c ) and [ dimerconf](d ) ] .",
    "meanwhile , for small @xmath16 and @xmath17 , a repulsive case , a highly degenerate phase is stabilized [ see an example in fig .",
    "[ dimerconf](b ) ] . for the isotropic case @xmath18 ,",
    "results of some numerical calculations are already available in the literature @xcite , but its extension to the anisotropic case @xmath19 is still lacking .",
    "therefore , we shall clarify the global phase diagram and provide evidence corroborating the properties of the phase transitions observed in anisotropically interacting dimers .    according to the effective field theory discussed by papanikolaou , luijten , and fradkin ( plf ) @xcite ,",
    "one effect absent in the isotropic system is a perturbation by the orientational order parameter ; this brings about berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transitions @xcite .",
    "another effect is a renormalization of the so - called geometric factor , which becomes important in numerical calculations of universal quantities , e.g. , the central charge and the scaling dimensions of operators ( see below ) . in such cases ,",
    "as demonstrated in our own research on an antiferromagnetic potts model with anisotropic next - nearest - neighbor couplings , the so - called level - spectroscopy analysis @xcite can provide an effective way to determine phase transition points @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we shall also employ the same strategy for the present model @xcite .    for later convenience",
    ", we shall briefly explain here the string representation of the dm on @xmath2 . as explicitly explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , the transformation of a dimer configuration , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ dimerconf](a ) , to a string configuration is performed via an ` xor ` operation with reference configuration [ fig .",
    "[ dimerconf](b ) ] .",
    "the ` xor ` operation takes the exclusive ` or ` between occupation ( binary ) numbers in these two configurations over each bond .",
    "consequently , we obtain strings running in the @xmath20 direction [ see the two gray lines in fig .",
    "[ dimerconf](a ) ] . due to the close - packing condition",
    ", they have no end points , and thus the string configurations for a @xmath21 system ( @xmath22 is an even number ) with periodic boundary conditions can be characterized by winding numbers @xmath23 satisfying @xmath24 .",
    "while in the numerical calculation of the transfer matrices we shall employ @xmath25 as a conserved quantity in the row - to - row transfer of configurations , we would rather use a quantity @xmath26 @xmath27 for convenience in our discussion .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec_theory ] , we review previous research results to give an effective description of the low - energy and long - distance behavior of the idms @xcite .",
    "in particular , the operator content of the theory , including expressions of local order parameters and defect operators , and their scaling dimensions are explained in detail .",
    "we then provide the conditions to determine the bkt - transition points and clarify some universal relations among excitation levels , which serve as a check of our calculational results . in doing this",
    ", a correspondence with a frustrated quantum - spin chain system plays a guiding role .",
    "thus , this correspondence will be emphasized and referred to when appropriate . in sec .",
    "[ sec_numerical ] , we summarize our numerical study and results obtained by the transfer - matrix calculations based on the conformal field theory ( cft ) @xcite . first , we demonstrate that the theoretical predictions in sec .",
    "[ sec_theory ] can be observed precisely via numerical analysis of the excitation spectra .",
    "next , we provide the global phase diagram of interacting dimers , which includes the bkt , the second - order , and the first - order transition lines . also , in a strong repulsion region , we expect a highly degenerate phase including the staggered state .",
    "we calculate the string - number dependence of the free - energy density for the isotropic case .",
    "furthermore , we investigate the `` dispersion relation '' of the one - string motion , and then based on these data we shall try to give an insight into properties of the strong repulsion phase . the last section , sec .  [ sec_discussions ] , is devoted to discussion and summary .",
    "we also provide our method to evaluate the original bkt transition in the isotropic system .",
    "finally , we compare our data with previous research results .",
    "continuum field theories offer unified approaches to investigate phase transitions in interacting systems on lattices .",
    "they are derived in the scaling limit , @xmath28 while keeping @xmath29 finite .",
    "here @xmath30 is the geometric factor , taking a fixed value , e.g. , @xmath31 @xmath32 for isotropic systems on a square ( triangular ) lattice .",
    "however , for anisotropic systems , renormalization of @xmath30 is necessary due to interactions leading to non - universal values .",
    "the renormalized @xmath30 can be also related to the velocity of an elementary excitation observed in tomonaga - luttinger liquids @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath30 disappears from the theoretical description if we properly employ its renormalized value ; but as we will see in sec .  [ sec_numerical ]",
    ", it becomes rather important in numerical calculations .    according to plf",
    ", the effective description of the idm takes the form of a sine - gordon field theory @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "its expression is given by the lagrangian density @xmath33 with @xmath34 we denote the course - grained height field in the two - dimensional euclidean space as @xmath35 , which satisfies a periodicity in height space of @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) @xcite .",
    "due to the close - packing of the dimers , the defect operators given in terms of the disorder field @xmath38 dual to @xmath39 are absent from @xmath40 , so that it represents a roughening phase or flat phases of an interface model in three dimensions .",
    "the theoretical parameter @xmath10 ( the gaussian coupling ) describes the stiffness , and determines the dimensions of the operators on the gaussian fixed line @xmath41 . in our notation ,",
    "the vertex operator with @xmath42 electric and @xmath43 magnetic charges is given by @xmath44 whose dimension is @xmath45 therefore , @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) represents the condition that the perturbation @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) becomes marginal .    to make our discussion more concrete , we introduce the average ( @xmath50 ) and the difference ( @xmath51 ) of the couplings as @xmath52 where the first ( second ) subscript refers to the upper ( lower ) sign",
    "then , around the non - interacting point , the parameters in @xmath40 are roughly given by @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "we see that the attractive interaction @xmath55 increases @xmath10 , and tends to stabilize the columnar states .",
    "also , @xmath56 in @xmath48 ( the orientational order parameter ) is proportional to the difference , @xmath57 , while @xmath58 in @xmath49 which is a remnant from the discreteness of the square lattice is almost constant . for @xmath59 ,",
    "both nonlinear terms are relevant , but they are not competing against each other , so the fourfold - degenerate columnar state stabilized by @xmath49 is only lifted to realize twofold - degenerate columnar states by @xmath48 ( see below ) . since the bkt transition by @xmath49",
    "was already discussed in the literature @xcite , we shall focus our attention on the role of @xmath48 .    according to the standard argument @xcite ,",
    "the renormalization - group ( rg ) flow diagram of the sine - gordon model @xmath60 ( here @xmath49 is irrelevant ) is expressed by the bkt rg equations @xcite ; we depict it by employing the coupling constants @xmath61 @xmath62 and @xmath56 in fig .",
    "[ rgflow ] , where the separatrices @xmath63 separate the dimer - liquid phase from two types of twofold - degenerate columnar phases , namely , the horizontal columnar ( hc ) state consisting of dimers in the horizontal direction and the vertical columnar ( vc ) state consisting of dimers in the vertical direction . now , we can point out that our task to treat the bkt transitions in the idm can be related to the investigation of the spin-@xmath64 xxz chain with next - nearest - neighbor interaction because these share the same effective description @xcite . to specify the relationship",
    ", we introduce the following operators : @xmath65 here @xmath66 stand for the horizontal and the vertical components of the columnar local order parameter , and take expectation values @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) in the hc ( vc ) phase ; @xmath71 are the defect ( or monomer ) operators which change the winding numbers classifying dimer configurations .",
    "alternatively , in the quantum - spin chain language , eqs .",
    "( [ eq_neel])([eq_dimer ] ) correspond to the nel , the doublet , and the dimer operators , and give the lowest excitations in the nel , the spin - liquid , and the dimer phases , respectively ( see table  [ tabi ] ) .",
    "nomura and okamoto ( no ) provided criteria to determine the bkt - transition points between the spin - liquid and the nel ( or dimer ) phases based on one - loop calculations of the scaling dimensions of these operators @xcite .",
    "therefore , following their argument , we shall discuss procedures to determine the bkt - transition points in our idm .",
    "consider a system with a finite - strip geometry , viz .",
    ", a narrow band of width @xmath22 along the @xmath72 direction and infinite length along the @xmath20 direction .",
    "the periodic boundary condition is imposed across the width of the strip .",
    "the finite - size corrections to the scaling dimensions of the above operators are our key quantities to be evaluated analytically and numerically . here , we first consider the system near the separatrix @xmath73 where a small parameter @xmath74 can be introduced , so that @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "next , the conformal perturbation calculations of the renormalized scaling dimensions were performed using the sine - gordon lagrangian density , for which the results can be summarized as follows : @xmath77 ( @xmath78 is the logarithmic scale length ) @xcite . according to the discussion by no",
    ", we can find the criterion to determine the bkt - transition point @xmath79 ( i.e. , the level - crossing condition ) @xmath80 and the level - splitting condition as @xmath81 the latter is one of the universal relations among the excitation levels on the separatrix @xcite , and enables us to check the consistency of the calculations .",
    "second , we investigate the system near the separatrix @xmath82 ; it proceeds in an analogous way to the above .",
    "writing @xmath83 , we then obtain the dimensions as @xmath84 thus , the level - crossing condition needed to determine the transition point is given by @xmath85 and the level - splitting condition is given by @xmath86 in analogy to the quantum - spin chain , each level crossing represents an emergence of a su(2 ) multiplet structure consisting of the singlet and the triplet states ( e.g. , @xmath87 and @xmath88 at @xmath73 ) .",
    "since these are the low - energy levels in the level-1 su(2 ) wess - zumino - witten model @xcite , our criteria , eqs .",
    "( [ eq_bkt_neel ] ) and ( [ eq_bkt_dimer ] ) , are natural and also convincing from this viewpoint .    at this stage ,",
    "two comments are in order about the advantage in using these relations ( the level - spectroscopy approach ) and the structure of the phase diagram . in sec .",
    "iii , we will outline the numerical transfer - matrix calculations performed to obtain the phase diagram .",
    "although it can treat systems with a strip geometry , accessible sizes are strongly restricted to small values , e.g. , @xmath89 in our calculations . in the bkt transition ,",
    "as seen above , the correction terms are typically given by the logarithmic form @xmath90 .",
    "if we employ the standard kt criterion such as @xmath91 to determine the transition point , its finite - size estimates include these , and thus exhibit a slow convergence in their extrapolation to the thermodynamical limit .",
    "alternatively , criteria  ( [ eq_bkt_neel ] ) and ( [ eq_bkt_dimer ] ) take the logarithmic corrections into account , so they provide finite - size estimates with fast convergences @xcite .",
    "consequently , we can employ the following least - squares - fitting form in extrapolating the finite - size data @xmath92 to the thermodynamic limit @xmath93 : @xmath94 which includes the @xmath95 term stemming from the @xmath96 irrelevant operators as the leading universal correction @xcite .",
    "the biases from the finite - strip geometry disappear in the limit , and the phase diagram is symmetric with respect to the isotropic line @xmath18 which is one of the inherent properties of the model . here , we describe how the symmetry of the lattice model is embedded in the sine - gordon field theory .",
    "we shall consider the generators of the @xmath97-point group : the @xmath98 rotation ( @xmath99 ) and the reflection in the @xmath72 axis ( @xmath100 ) about the original site [ see fig .",

    "in addition , the above four operators transform as @xmath106 thus , the symmetry operation @xmath102 interchanges the roles of the hc and the vc operators while leaving unchanged the doublet of the monomer excitations .",
    "consequently , as expected , the level - crossing and the level - splitting conditions for @xmath107 , eqs .",
    "( [ eq_bkt_neel ] ) and ( [ eq_dlog_neel ] ) , are translated to those for @xmath108 , eqs .",
    "( [ eq_bkt_dimer ] ) and ( [ eq_dlog_dimer ] ) . in sec .",

    "now , consider a system on @xmath2 with the @xmath109 stripe geometry and introduce the transfer matrix @xmath110 connecting nearest - neighbor rows in the @xmath20 direction [ see fig .",

    "the ground state is found in the @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) sector , and the excited levels are also in the sectors specified by the discrete symmetries given in table  [ tabi ] .",
    "in addition , since , independent of the value of @xmath10 , the scaling dimension of a level-1 descendant is equal to 1 , it has been utilized to estimate a velocity of elementary excitation in the tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( see , for example , @xcite ) . according to their treatment , the effective geometric factor ( i.e. , inverse velocity ) can be also calculated from the descendant level , say @xmath124 , as @xcite @xmath125 the corresponding excitation with small momentum can be found numerically . in calculating @xmath115 and @xmath72 from the excitation gaps via eq .",
    "( [ eq_c_xs ] ) , an estimate of @xmath30 first needs to be obtained .",
    "however , it is not necessary in determining the bkt - transition points by eqs .",

    "the methodological aspects of transfer - matrix calculations have been well explained in the literature @xcite .",
    "furthermore , due to the sparse nature of the matrices , we can output all elements to hard disk .",
    "then , using the ` arpack ` library @xcite , we can calculate the dominant eigenvalues of the nonsymmetric real matrices .    as a demonstration we give the @xmath57 dependence of the scaling dimensions at @xmath126 in fig .",

    "while the data are for a system with @xmath0 , we can see the excitation spectra approach quite close to the exact ones at the non - interacting point @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we find that the hc and the vc excitations interchange their behaviors at @xmath129 , and the former ( the latter ) shows a level crossing with the doublet excitations at a certain negative ( positive ) value .",
    "according to theoretical predictions ( [ eq_bkt_neel ] ) and ( [ eq_bkt_dimer ] ) , these can provide finite - size estimates of the bkt - transition points to the hc and the vc phases ; we shall give some evidence to support our augment . in fig .",

    "[ phasediagram ] , we summarize our results of numerical calculations for the global phase diagram of our model  ( [ eq_hamil ] ) , in which the diagonal line ( the center point ) corresponds to the isotropic ( noninteracting ) system . due to the fact that the phase diagram is symmetric about the line ,",

    "[ oneparticle ] , for several values of the interactions ( isotropic cases ) , we draw the lower two of four bands . when the eigenvalue becomes a complex number , we take its magnitude in the plot . while the symmetric two - band structure for the non - interacting case [ fig .",
    "[ oneparticle](a ) ] @xcite is deformed by interactions , there is a unique minimum at @xmath177 for finite interaction cases [ figs .",
    "[ oneparticle](b ) and [ oneparticle](c ) ] . at the same time , as expressed by the dotted lines , complex - conjugate pairs of eigenvalues start to appear near the zone boundary points @xmath178 . and",
    "then , in the strong repulsion limit [ fig .",
    "[ oneparticle](d ) ] , we find an emergence of a two - fold degenerate zero - energy flat band .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues are given by @xmath179 , which represents the modulations with wave number @xmath180 in the @xmath20 direction @xcite .",
    "consequently , our results show dispersionless motion in the @xmath170 $ ] and the @xmath171 $ ] directions , which precisely reflect the above - mentioned degeneracy , and thus this flat band structure may be a signature of the subextensive degeneracy in the staggered state .",
    "if we accept this naive argument , we can conjecture that the staggered state is only realized in the limit",
    ". however , our argument is of course at a very speculative level ; a full understanding should include also the degeneracy in many - string sectors .",
    "the isotropic case was discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the bkt - transition point driven by @xmath49 and the first - order transition point to the strong repulsion phase were numerically obtained .",
    "we have also estimated these transition points ( see the double circle and the double square in fig .  [ phasediagram ] ) ; in particular , for the former , the above level - spectroscopy approach has been applied .",
    "thus , here we briefly explain our procedure and compare the results . since the lagrangian density @xmath181 is analyzed in the region @xmath182 , we focus our attention not on @xmath66 but instead on the following order parameters responsible for the breaking of the @xmath98 rotational symmetry : @xmath183 while the former is the orientational order parameter , the latter represents the plaquette order @xcite which has not been found in classical dms @xcite ( the locking points are @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath186 , and @xmath187 ) .",
    "one then finds that via the transformation @xmath188 and @xmath189 , the lagrangian density and the operators are reduced to @xmath190 therefore , from the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec_theory ] , the level - crossing and the level - splitting conditions ( [ eq_bkt_neel ] ) and ( [ eq_dlog_neel ] ) are satisfied by the scaling dimensions of these operators , say @xmath191 ( here , we have taken the condition @xmath192 into account ) .",
    "since the half - charge excitations @xmath193 are absent in our system , we employ the condition @xmath194 to determine the bkt - transition point .",
    "the corresponding excitation levels can be found in the sectors specified by their symmetries given in table  [ tabi ] .",
    "we extrapolate the finite - size estimates up to @xmath0 to the thermodynamic limit according to eq .",
    "( [ eq_extrap ] ) .",
    "we then obtain the bkt - transition point as @xmath195 .",
    "as we see in table  [ tabii ] , the agreement with previous results is very good , which indicates that our approach is valid . similarly , for first - order phase transition , we have estimated the point via condition @xmath196 ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) while others have determined this transition from a point of breakdown in the condition @xmath146 . our result is closer to the estimate of alet et al .",
    "@xcite although there still exists considerable discrepancy among these estimates .",
    "likewise for instance for phase - separation transitions observed in one - dimensional electron systems , higher - order corrections have been argued to ambiguously affect estimations @xcite .",
    "thus , we think that the discrepancy in these estimates may reflect their effects .",
    "to summarize , we investigated the anisotropically interacting dimer model on a square lattice . for the attractive case , the orientational - order - parameter perturbation introduced by the anisotropy brings about the bkt transition to the columnar phases .",
    "we pointed out the close relationship of our model to a frustrated quantum - spin chain and then found the criteria to determine the transition points . using these , we performed level - spectroscopy analysis of the eigenvalue structures of the transfer matrices .",
    "numerical results were then summarized as the global phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] ) , which includes the dimer - liquid , the columnar , and the strong repulsion phases .",
    "furthermore , we checked the level - splitting conditions and evaluated the value of the central charge , which provided solid evidence to confirm the universality of the phase transition .",
    "by contrast , for the repulsive case , although we determined the dimer - liquid phase boundary , there exist some points with unclear status within the strong repulsion phase including the staggered state .",
    "based on the dispersion relation of the one - string motion , we gave a possible scenario for the stabilization of the staggered phase .",
    "however , although this issue still remains an open question , we now think that the nature of the nonsymmetric real matrix might have relevance to its description @xcite .",
    "the author thanks y. tanaka , m. fujimoto , k. kobayashi , and k. nomura for stimulating discussions .",
    "most of the computations were performed using the facilities of information synergy center in tohoku university .",
    "this work was supported by grants - in - aid from the japan society for the promotion of science , scientific research ( c ) , contract no .",
    "in this appendix , we shall explain how to construct the transfer matrix in the one - string sector and an analytical calculation of eigenvalues by the use of a fourier transformation . since a row of the reference configuration given in fig .",
    "[ dimerconf](b ) expresses a string vacuum state , we write it as @xmath197 ( see the top left in fig .",
    "[ states - elements ] ) . for convenience ,",
    "we treat two sites in the @xmath72 direction as one unit cell which includes four bonds ( see squares by dotted blue lines ) .",
    "then , one - string states can be obtained via replacements of one of @xmath198 @xmath199 unit cells in @xmath197 by four possible dimer configurations . from left to right of the first line in fig .",
    "[ states - elements ] ( except for the vacuum ) , we call these as @xmath200 , @xmath201 , @xmath202 , and @xmath203 , respectively . here",
    ", the center is supposed to be an @xmath204th unit cell ( @xmath205 $ ] ) .",
    "now , consider transfers of one - string states to those in the next - nearest - neighbor row in the @xmath20 direction .",
    "then , one can find 24 microscopic processes , which are listed in subsequent lines in fig .",
    "[ states - elements ] .",
    "for instance , the second line shows seven microscopic processes of transfers from @xmath200 in the first row to states in the third row , and thus exhibits an operation of the transfer matrix , i.e. , @xmath206 .",
    "consequently , we can obtain the following recursion relations for the transfers in the one - string sector      where coefficients represent the boltzmann weights of interactions in the first and the second rows .",
    "next , by the use of the fourier transformation , we can block - diagonalize the representation of @xmath208 : suppose that @xmath209 then the @xmath175-block representation spanned by states @xmath210 , @xmath211 , @xmath212 , @xmath213 is given by a @xmath214 complex nonsymmetric matrix : @xmath215_q     =     \\begin{pmatrix }      v^2 & h   +   z_q & h   + \\bar z_q   & 1 +   z_q \\\\",
    "v^2 & h^2 +   z_q & h   + h\\bar z_q   & h+   z_q \\\\",
    "v^2 & h   + h z_q & h^2 + \\bar z_q   & 1+h z_q \\\\      0    & v^2        & v^2   \\bar z_q   & v^2      \\\\     \\end{pmatrix},\\ ] ] where @xmath216 .",
    "hence , the characteristic equation to determine eigenvalues @xmath217 is given by      since it is invariant under a transformation @xmath219 , a @xmath175 dependence of the eigenvalue structure is even with respect to the point @xmath177 .",
    "meanwhile , in general cases we use a software to evaluate @xmath175 dependences of eigenvalues ; in some limiting cases , eq .",
    "( [ characteristicequation ] ) becomes simple and permits us to easily manipulate : for instance , for the noninteracting case @xmath220 , two of the four eigenvalues are zero , and the rest is obtained from an equation @xmath221 .",
    "it then provides two real bands , as given in fig .",
    "[ oneparticle](a ) .",
    "in contrast , for the strong repulsion limit @xmath222 , two of the four eigenvalues are zero again , but others are complex values with a modulus of 1 , i.e. , @xmath223 [ see fig .",
    "[ oneparticle](d ) ] .",
