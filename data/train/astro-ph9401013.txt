    "the time delay between the images of a gravitationally lensed object is of great astrophysical interest since it may be used to determine the hubble parameter as well as the mass of the lens ( refsdal @xcite , @xcite , borgeest @xcite , falco et al .",

    "it is also often claimed ( lehr @xcite , roberts et al .",
    "@xcite , prhb ) that the radio data decisively exclude a delay of around 415 days , a value favoured by other authors ( vanderriest et al .",
    "@xcite , schild 1990 ) .",
    "the time delay obtained by prha is quite close to 1.5 years , a value for which windowing effects due to the uneven sampling of the optical data are expected to be strongest ( vanderriest et al .",

    "the main emphasis of our work is the evaluation of two competing hypothetical time delays : 415 and 536 days .    for the combined data set generated from the data of image a and the data of image b , time shifted by @xmath1",
    ", we basically estimate the dispersion @xmath3 of the scatter around the unknown mean curve",
    ". the true time delay between the images should then show up as a minimum in the dispersion spectrum @xmath4 .",
    "it is our aim to determine the dispersion of the combined data due to the alternation between the two light curves , and not the dispersion within each lightcurve . in order to avoid strong windowing effects we therefore take into account only alternating neighbouring pairs in the combined data set",
    ", i.e. only pairs where one point is from a and the other one from b , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that for @xmath5 years ( where @xmath6 is integer ) the dispersion @xmath4 would otherwise be strongly dominated by the inner dispersion of the two original light curves , naturally leading to pronounced minima .    in section 2 of the paper",
    "we introduce the basic statistical techniques used . in section 3",
    "we present the results of a detailed analysis of the light curves of the double quasar 0957 + 561 a , b .",
    "we here use the same data sets as prha and prhb to allow a comparison of the results and to understand the problems leading to the different results . in the concluding",
    "part we try to summarize the work done on time delay estimation up to now and to delineate some inner difficulties of the problem under study .",
    "technical details of the nonparametric dispersion estimation are treated in the appendix .",
    "in the papers prha , prhb and rybicki et al .",
    "( @xcite ) a rather complex procedure for an optimal interpolation of the lightcurves was developed .",
    "the procedure itself is practically the same as used in geophysical research under the name of _ kriging _",
    "( cabrera et al .",
    "the use of sound statistical arguments and validation of the results by monte - carlo simulations allowed the authors to draw conclusions on the probable time delay with a ( formally ) high level of confidence . since our analysis did not fully confirm these results , we reimplemented the procedures used in prha and prhb and used some simple procedures to check the inner consistency of the results .",
    "we started from a very simple computation of the number of mixed data pairs in the combined sequence ( data set b shifted by @xmath1 coalesced with data set a ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the number of neighbouring data pairs of mixed type ( one from data set a , one from data set b ) is plotted against the trial time delays .",
    "this simple statistic measures well the total overlap between the two data sets for different shifts in time of the b component .",
    "inside of the range of probable delays quoted in prha two strong minima at @xmath7 days,@xmath8 and at @xmath9 days , @xmath8 are found .",
    "there is a strong similarity between the window function plot in prha and our simple statistic .",
    "it is quite obvious ( and was noticed also by prha ) that the coincidence of minima in the window function and in the @xmath10 spectrum in prha is a rather serious signal about the complexity of problems one encounters with the lightcurves of qso 0957 + 561 .",
    "after reimplementation of the prha procedures we carried out the following simple experiment .",
    "we divided the data points of the combined data set ( computed with @xmath11 days ) into two subsets : relevant and irrelevant . into the first subset we included observations which had at least one nearest neighbour from alternate original data sets , and into the second subset we included observations for which both neighbours had the same origin as the data point under consideration .",
    "after computation of the optimally approximated ( predicted ) values for all data points , we were now able to compute separately prediction errors for relevant and irrelevant observational points .",
    "_ we found that the dispersion for relevant points was by a factor of five larger than that for irrelevant points_.    this result lead us to another interesting test .",
    "we repeated monte - carlo simulation runs with different time delay values exactly as described in prha and used our data set subdivision procedure for each of the generated artificial data sets .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the resulting distribution of dispersion ratios is shown . the mean ratio is slightly less than unity",
    "this fact can be explained in the following way : the overlap regions for the two original data sets are populated in the mean two times more densely than regions where only one data set is seen . for the sparsely populated regions",
    "there is a tendency for the optimal prediction procedure to put the prediction curve through the observed points and consequently in these regions the dispersion for prediction errors is as a rule less than for overlapped regions .",
    "however , as can be seen from the distribution diagram , the typical decrease is by far not as severe as for the original data set ( marked in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the conclusion is discouraging : the monte - carlo procedure proposed in prha , which was considered as _",
    "experimentum crucis _ for their time delay computations does not model the actual data set at hand , but _ it proves only that for data sets with certain regular statistical properties their procedure works quite well_. the real data set is unfortunately more complex , this is probably caused by microlensing .",
    "our negative experience with the optimal prediction procedure lead us to the conclusion that to understand all the intricacies involved with the actual observations we must seek some extremely simple statistics whose use is not shadowed by the complexities of the mathematical procedures involved .",
    "our aim was not so much to prove that one or another delay value is right or wrong , but to understand how the different values are `` cooked '' from the data set .",
    "let @xmath12 and @xmath13 be two time series which are different measurements of the original light curve @xmath14 .",
    "it is assumed that for channel b the observations @xmath15 are amplified with an unknown amplification ratio @xmath16 .",
    "observed values contain also observational errors @xmath17 for which we may have certain dispersion estimates @xmath18 or corresponding statistical weights @xmath19 .",
    "our task is to estimate the time shift parameter @xmath1 from observed time series .    for every fixed set of values @xmath20 we can construct a combined data set from both observed series @xmath21 and estimate its dispersion @xmath22 with the simple nonparametric method described in the appendix .",
    "the _ dispersion spectrum _ is now defined as : @xmath23    statistical weights can be introduced into our scheme by using the usual combined weights for every pair of observations . if the statistical weight of channel a is @xmath24 and that of channel b is @xmath25 then the dispersion for the difference @xmath26 is equal to @xmath27 and the squared difference of the two observations must be consequently included with weights @xmath28 a correct normalization is obtained by dividing the corresponding sums of squared differences by the total sum of weights .    by choosing different selection windows ( see appendix )",
    "we can now compute different statistics and compute corresponding dispersion spectra . in several numerical experiments we tried to understand the behaviour of many different variants depending on features in the data sets at hand .",
    "however , to present our results we use only one , and by the way the simplest algorithm : only neighbouring data points are considered as near enough , to be included in the cross - sums .",
    "we even do not specify an upper limit @xmath29 for a maximum allowed time separation between two sequential points .",
    "this approach allows us to avoid _ any free parameters _ in our procedures , and makes the calculations simple enough to be well reproduced by other researchers .",
    "correspondingly , we use in the following analysis only two simple statistics .",
    "the first one @xmath30 measures the general dispersion of the combined data set .",
    "the second statistic @xmath31 where @xmath32 only when @xmath33 and @xmath34 are from different data sets and @xmath35 otherwise , measures the dispersion in the overlap areas of the combined light curve .",
    "to get an idea about error bars for the minima in the dispersion spectra we used a simple bootstrap procedure .",
    "we applied a 7-point median filter to smooth the combined light curve and reshuffled the corresponding residuals 1000 times to generate bootstrap samples .",
    "the full procedure turned out to be not very dependent on the median filter length , we therefore present only results for the particular value of 7 .",
    "it must be stressed that the somewhat arbitrary value for the filter length was used only to estimate mean square errors of the computed values of the minima , the minima themselves do not depend on any prechoosen numerical constant .",
    "it is possible to get much more narrow limits to the computed shift estimates by using longer smoothing filters , but we wanted to be as conservative as possible .      to demonstrate the effect of removing short segments of data from the analysis we used the following simple procedure . for any starting index value @xmath36 in the row of observations , for any skip length @xmath37 and for any pair of hypothetical shift values",
    "@xmath38 which are interesting for us we can compute the statistic ( _ gain _ of hypothesis @xmath39 against @xmath40 ) @xmath41 where the dispersions are computed for data sets with skips ( start of data skip from @xmath36 , length of skipped subset @xmath37 points )",
    ". in various experiments we used different skipping schemes : sometimes we skipped observing points for both channels , sometimes only from one channel .",
    "the statistic @xmath42 allowed us to compare the influence of skipped values for two different hypothetical time delays .",
    "maxima and minima in @xmath42 indicate skips which favor hypothesis @xmath43 and hypothesis @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "this kind of approach is quite common in standard regression analysis where robustness of the predicted curve is tested against removal of a small number of observed values ( outliers ) . in our case",
    "we assume that the correct estimate for the time delay should not depend strongly on a small number of observations .",
    "if it does , we conclude that some of the data points are real outliers , or that the available data sets do not contain enough information to discriminate between the two hypotheses .",
    "we used the same data as prha , i.e.  the optical data published by vanderriest et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath45 ( eq .  [ firststat ] ) and @xmath46 ( eq .  [ secondstat ] ) statistics for the original optical data set are depicted in fig .",
    "the strongest local minima in the @xmath46 spectrum is at a shift of @xmath47 days and bootstrap calculations give us a standard error value of @xmath48 days , so that our result is in good agreement with the value given in prha .",
    "it is interesting to note that the mean shift for the bootstrap trials occurred to be biased to a shift of @xmath49 days .",
    "there is an additional depression around @xmath50 days which is , however , somewhat weaker than the main `` peak '' .",
    "it is important to note that the @xmath46 spectrum stays _ everywhere _ well above the @xmath45 spectrum , i.e.  the dispersion in the overlap region is systematically higher than in the intervening regions .",
    "we therefore conclude that there must be a certain amount of additional mutual variability between two light curves ( maybe due to microlensing ) , so that the model of shifted but otherwise similar images , which has been used here and in prha , is oversimplified .",
    "to get an idea about the form of the real depression in the dispersion spectra we proceed with a simple numerical experiment .",
    "we combined the a and b datasets with the best shift and the best @xmath16 value , filtered the combined data set with a 7-point median filter , and decompose the filtered set back into two subsets .",
    "the spectra for the real data set and for the artificial data set ( with a delay of 536 days ) are given in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . the spectrum for the real data set",
    "is depicted in the two nearby curves .",
    "the upper curve is the dispersion spectrum _ plus _ the estimated subsampling error for the particular shift value and the lower curve is the dispersion spectrum _ minus _ the subsampling error estimate .",
    "thus , the difference between the two curves demonstrates the uncertainty due to the subsampling . the minimum value in the spectrum for",
    "the artificial set ( which is @xmath51 if we use the notation from the appendix , see eq .",
    "( [ trend ] ) ) is comparable to the largest difference between the upper and the lower limit for the original spectra .",
    "it is therefore clear that our dispersion estimation scheme works here ( at least in the region of the main minimum ) nearly optimally .",
    "it can be seen that the `` line profiles '' of the real and the artificial spectra differ significantly .",
    "the feature in the real spectrum is more fluctuation like than the wide and systematic depression in the artificial spectrum .",
    "we then investigated the robustness of our first solution against skipping short segments from both light curves . the strong motivation to do",
    "this kind of analysis stems from the remark of prha that the `` feature at epoch 6200 '' can bias estimation of the shift value towards @xmath50 days .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the results of a typical sensitivity analysis are shown . the gain @xmath52 ( eq .",
    "[ gain ] ) of hypothesis @xmath11 days against @xmath53 days is plotted against the starting index of a three point skip in the original data set .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] the corresponding spectra are plotted : one with the most favorable ( for hypothesis @xmath11 days , minimum at @xmath54 ) skip , and one with the most unfavourable ( maximum at @xmath55 ) .",
    "it is seen that the feature in the region of @xmath56 days undergoes a rather dramatic change , whereas the feature around @xmath50 days remains relatively stable . by skipping only _ three consecutive time points",
    "_ ( the a and b channels are observed simultaneously ) we can strongly emphasize the @xmath56 feature , or remove it completely !",
    "there is no need to say that for longer gaps the effect of skips is even more drastic .    from these experiments we concluded that it is reasonable to investigate the high frequency behaviour of the optical data sets .",
    "since our investigation is of explorative type , we postulated freely ( at least for the moment ) that both light curves are corrupted by independent low frequency components ( which can be physically interpreted as microlensing ) .",
    "we assumed that these components can be modeled by low degree polynomials .    in figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] and [ fig22 ] the @xmath46 spectra for data sets which were obtained by removing polynomial trends with degrees @xmath57 from the original data sets are shown .",
    "the feature around @xmath50 days is much stronger than the feature around @xmath56 days for degrees 1,3,5,6,7,8,9 . for degrees 2 and 4 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) the minima for both hypothetical shifts are comparable .",
    "it is evident that starting from degree 5 the behaviour of dispersion spectra is quite similar . for our further presentations",
    "we arbitrarily choose polynomials with degree @xmath58 and in the following discussion we use as detrended data sets the corresponding least squares fit residuals .",
    "the computations with other degrees ( from 5 to 8) gave essentially the same results .    in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] the @xmath45 and @xmath46 spectra for the detrended data are depicted .",
    "it is worth to note that the minimum of @xmath46 now nearly coincides with the value of @xmath45 for the same shift .",
    "correspondingly the dispersion for the overlap areas and for the intervening areas are nearly the same for the best shift ! _ the excess dispersion between the two light curves , which is probably due to microlensing , is removed_. at least from this point of view the @xmath53 days solution is much more consistent than the solution with @xmath11 days .",
    "we then repeated our experiment with the artificial data set . in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] the overall correspondence between the two spectra is striking",
    ". it seems , however , that the exact value of @xmath50 days for the very narrow dip of the real spectrum can be slightly out of place , because it is `` cooked '' by high frequency local fluctuation just on the bottom of the feature .",
    "the sensitivity analysis for the detrended data sets is also revealing . in figs .",
    "[ fig10 ] and  [ fig11 ] it can be seen that the feature around @xmath56 days can be amplified significantly or can be removed nearly completely by skipping three consecutive observing nights from the original data sets . on the other hand",
    "the depression around @xmath50 is rather stable .",
    "the bootstrap procedure gives us for the detrended data a standard error of @xmath59 days for the alternative solution of @xmath50 days .",
    "the distribution of @xmath60 trials is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] .",
    "there are two competing values for the time delay , both of which we were able to derive from optical data using exactly the same techniques .",
    "we hoped that the analysis of the radio data could have given us clues as to which of them should be preferred .",
    "we used the radio data published by lehr et al .",
    "( @xcite ) exactly in the manner they were used in prhb .",
    "the observations marked in prhb by an asterisk were skipped and the other observed values were transformed to logarithmic scale .",
    "the @xmath45 and @xmath46 spectra ( eqs .",
    "[ firststat ] and [ secondstat ] ) for the radio data are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] .",
    "the total minimum at ( @xmath61 ) days ( error bars from bootstrapping ) is again in very good agreement with the result of prhb .",
    "this coincidence is so good that one may well be inclined to drop the @xmath53 day hypothesis completely .",
    "the plot of two light curves with appropriate shift and parameter @xmath16 ( fig .  [ fig14 ] ) fits well into this picture .    nonetheless , we applied to the radio data some of the tests already used for the optical data .",
    "we first repeated the experiments with artificial data sets generated from the combined original data sets by 7-point median filtering . in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] the plot of the original and the artificial spectra are shown .",
    "the results are not very convincing , neither _",
    "pro _ nor _",
    "contra_. however , it seems that the artificial spectrum ( with @xmath62 days ) has a slightly more pronounced minimum .",
    "we then experimented with various skipping schemes , to look how stable our results are against removal of a small number of observations .",
    "it was quite surprising to find that the removal of _ only two successive outlying points from the b curve _ can change the situation dramatically , see fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] .",
    "the lower curve is the evaluation of the @xmath11 days hypothesis against the @xmath53 days hypothesis , when removing pairs of observations from _ only the b curve_. the upper curve depicts the same statistic for the data with two points removed from the b data set ( the skipped points are from april 10 , 1990 and may 7 , 1990 ) .",
    "it is seen that the data set with skips in the b curve is relatively stable against further removing of time points .    in fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] the original data points for the a and b curve are depicted , with linear interpolation between the points .",
    "the `` bad '' points are exactly the points which cause the strong fluctuation at the very end of the b data set .",
    "we proceed now with data set b without the two `` bad '' points .",
    "it is no surprise to see that the main minimum of the @xmath46 spectrum moves to @xmath63 days and that the overall correspondence between the artificial spectrum and the real one is also good ( see fig .  [ fig18 ] ) .",
    "quite pleasing is also the plot of the optimally shifted b curve with two skipped points and the original a curve ( see fig .",
    "[ fig19 ] ) .",
    "bootstrapping gives us an error of @xmath64 days for the shift , thus the correspondence between the results obtained from the optical and the radio observations is rather good .",
    "the error value must not be taken too seriously , since the use of a 7-point median filtering to build the mean curve estimates is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "however , it can be understood as a reasonable guess .",
    "let us first take the original optical and radio data sets as they are .",
    "we were able to reproduce the results of the rather complex analysis in prha and prhb , using extremely simple statistics .",
    "however , the simple formulation of our procedures also allowed to get additional insights into what is actually going on .",
    "we now summarize the _",
    "pro _ and _ contra _ arguments .",
    "the feature around @xmath11 days is located near the absolute minimum of the window function in the optical dispersion spectra and does not have a profile which is expected from the artificial curves .",
    "_ there is a large excess for the dispersion in the overlapped regions of the shifted light curves , and this is revealed using both methods of analysis . _",
    "the last fact also invalidates the monte - carlo results in prha because their data set models are too regular compared to the real data sets .",
    "this is well illustrated in fig .",
    "the dispersion spectra in the @xmath56 days region are rather sensitive to skipping few data points and detrending .",
    "original data sets are used . the statistically sound optimal prediction method and simple explorative type analysis method",
    "give essentially the same results .",
    "no additional or excessively metaphysical arguments are involved in the data analysis .",
    "good correspondence between optical and radio results .",
    "the good looking results are obtained after somewhat arbitrary detrending and removing part of the data from analysis . from the purist s point of view",
    "this is unacceptable",
    ".      for both data sets the results of the explorative analysis are relatively consistent and stable .",
    "the dispersion for the overlapped region in the spectrum for the optical data is nearly the same as for other regions .",
    "the overall form of the depressions in the dispersion spectra mimic quite well model spectra .      after the first version of this paper",
    "was completed a more extensive optical data set became available to us .",
    "these data have been obtained by r.  schild and contain 707 time points from november 1979 to june 1993 .",
    "here we present only a very short analysis of the new data , details will be presented elsewhere .    in fig .",
    "[ fig21 ] the dispersion spectrum for the full data set _ without any detrending and without any skips _ is plotted against the spectrum of the artificial data set which was computed by 7-point median filtering of the coalesced original data ( with b curve shifted by @xmath50 days ) .",
    "it can be seen that the feature around @xmath56 days is practically absent and the depression around @xmath50 days is well pronounced .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the analysis made by schild and thomson ( @xcite ) and thomson and schild ( @xcite ) .",
    "the number of observations in the extended data set is now much larger and probably sufficient to address the rather complicated question about the statistical significance of the feature around 415 days .",
    "as we demonstrated in section 2 the straightforward monte - carlo modelling can lead us to a wrong conclusion .",
    "therefore we plan to use more complex waveform models for the data sets which will include also parts describing microlensing .",
    "we introduced an extremely simple , but nevertheless sensitive method to seek probable time delay values for light curves which are assumed to originate from one and the same source .",
    "the method easily recovered results which were obtained by more complex and statistically sound procedures presented in prha and prhb .",
    "however , the simplicity of the proposed method allowed us to get additional insights into the problems which originate from unfortunate spacing of the sampling points for the optical light curves .",
    "it allowed us also to produce an alternative consistent solution for the time delay problem .",
    "the dispersion spectra of the optical and radio data can show minima in various places depending on the method of analysis and preprocessing of the data . for theoretical reasons delays @xmath65",
    "can be excluded .",
    "the minimum near 1.5 years most probably results from a statistical fluctuation which is amplified due to the windowing , since for this time shift the overlap of data from the two light curves is at a minimum and thus the least squares minimization has more freedom to fit free parameters .    for the radio data we found that removing only two observations from b gives a stable spectrum for the dispersions , with a best value for the shift near @xmath63 days .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the value of @xmath53 days for the optical curve , which reveals itself after the detrending of the original data , or in other circumstances which allow to depress the instable minimum around @xmath56 days .",
    "we think that the time delay controversy on qso 0957 + 561 a , b is still not settled , but there is quite strong evidence ( especially if we take into account preliminary results obtained using the extended data set by r. schild ) that the time delay is in the region of 400 - 420 days .",
    "we wish to thank l.  nieser , p.  king and a.  dent for helpful discussions and computational aid .",
    "it is a pleasure to acknowledge valuable discussion with rudy schild and david thomson , who also kindly provided us with their unpublished data .",

    "for a set of variables @xmath66 we observe that @xmath67 if we set @xmath68 the second term in the last expression vanishes and consequently the first double sum can be considered as a standard ( slightly biased ) estimator for the sample dispersion . taking into account that @xmath69 and using another normalization we can obtain the standard unbiased estimate @xmath70 for the dispersion : @xmath71 let @xmath72 be the total number of squares in the first sum , so that : @xmath73 the sequence of half squares @xmath74 can be looked upon as a general finite sample from which we can draw random subsamples @xmath75 . in this case the mean values @xmath76 approximate the original estimate @xmath70 . how good are these approximations ? from standard sampling theory ( cochran @xcite ) we get the estimate for the dispersion of @xmath77 ( _ subsampling dispersion _ ) : @xmath78 where * e * is mathematical expectation operator , @xmath3 is the dispersion for the full sample of half squares @xmath79 and @xmath80 is their mean value .",
    "we see that the approximation error vanishes if @xmath81 approaches @xmath82 .",
    "the important point is that even for small values of @xmath81 the subsampling error is as small as @xmath83 .    for the particular case of normally distributed @xmath84s",

    "the value for the trend dispersion @xmath93 can , however , be significant . in order to get an estimate for the error dispersion @xmath94 we must somehow eliminate the trend dispersion from the general sum . from the discussion above we know that we are not forced to use all pairs of squares to get dispersion estimates .",
    "let us choose only those pairs which have close enough observing times .",
    "formally we can define a _ selection window _ @xmath95 for some specified maximum allowable lag @xmath29 , and enter it into the general sum @xmath96 this choice of a subsample from the total of squares is not random from the point of view of its construction , but it is random from the point of view of the statistics of errors .    for a slowly varying trend @xmath14 we can assume that it is lipschitz continuous with some maximum slope parameter  @xmath97 @xmath98 and consequently the upper limit for the dispersion of the trend part can be estimated by @xmath99 the last limit is quite conservative , so that it should be used only for rather crude guesses .",
    "fortunately , the second sum can also be computed from the time point sequence .    for every fixed value of @xmath29",
    "there are @xmath100 pairs of squares to be taken into account when estimating the dispersion .",
    "the error from subsampling increases with decreasing @xmath81 ( and of course with decreasing @xmath29 ) .",
    "but the bias due to the trend part of the observed values ( _ modelling error _ ) decreases with decreasing @xmath29 .",
    "consequently there is a certain value for @xmath29 where both errors are of comparable magnitude .",
    "let us call this tradeoff value _",
    "optimal _ ( see fig . [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding @xmath101 can be used as an estimate for the original error dispersion .",
    "there is another well known procedure to choose a subsample of squared differences .",
    "we can select only pairs which consists of neighbouring observations in the original data .",
    "the corresponding estimate for dispersion is now @xmath102 in this estimate we avoided introduction of any free parameters into the selection scheme .",
    "similar estimates were proposed by different authors ( see von neumann et al .",
    "@xcite or in the context of periodicity search lafler&kinman @xcite ) .",
    "it is also possible to combine two subsampling schemes given above . in this case only neighbouring pairs of observations @xmath103 for which @xmath104 are included into the subsample .",
    "thereby we avoid additional scatter in our estimates due to the _ long gaps _ in the data set .",
    "however , every additional restriction for selected pairs decreases their total number and consequently increases the subsampling error .",
