    "ichihara  @xcite told us of a conjecture for knots in @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath5 denote the diameter of the set of boundary slopes of a knot @xmath6 and @xmath7 be the crossing number .    for @xmath6 a knot in @xmath3 , @xmath8 .",
    "( to be precise , ichihara proposed the conjecture only for montesinos knots and he and mizushima  @xcite have recently given a proof of that case . )    since @xmath9 , being the slope of a seifert surface , is always included in the set of boundary slopes , we have , as an immediate consequence , a conjecture due to ishikawa and shimokawa  @xcite :    let @xmath10 be a finite boundary slope for @xmath6 a knot in @xmath3 . then @xmath11 .    for example , it is easy to verify these conjectures for torus knots . for the unknot , @xmath12 . for a non - trivial torus knot",
    "@xmath13 we can assume @xmath14 relatively prime with @xmath15 .",
    "the boundary slopes are @xmath9 and @xmath16 @xcite while the crossing number is @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath18 . moreover , we have equality for the torus @xmath0bridge knots which are of the form @xmath19 with @xmath20 odd",
    ".    we will show that this equality obtains for all @xmath0bridge knots :    [ thmain]for @xmath6 a @xmath0bridge knot , @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath10 be a boundary slope for a @xmath0bridge knot @xmath6",
    ". then @xmath11 .",
    "this bound is sharp for the @xmath19 torus knots and there are many examples showing that it is also sharp for hyperbolic @xmath0bridge knots .    using conway notation , we can associate a rational number @xmath22 to each @xmath0bridge knot @xmath23 . hatcher and thurston",
    "@xcite showed how to calculate the boundary slopes of @xmath6 from continued fraction representations of @xmath22 . on the other hand ,",
    "the crossing number is given by summing the terms in a simple continued fraction for @xmath22 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "our technique is , starting with a simple continued fraction for @xmath22 , to compute all possible boundary slope continued fractions and identify those which yield the maximum and minimum boundary slopes .",
    "we can then verify that the difference between the maximum and minimum boundary slopes is twice the crossing number .    in section",
    "4 we develop four identities for continued fractions and in section  5 , we use those identities to establish four substitution rules .",
    "these substitution rules will allow us to produce all possible boundary slope continued fractions for a given rational number :    [ thm1 ] the boundary slope continued fractions of @xmath24 are among the continued fractions obtained by applying substitutions at non - adjacent positions in the simple continued fraction of @xmath22 .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm1 ] is presented in section  6 along with the following corollary .",
    "if @xmath25 $ ] is a simple continued fraction , then @xmath26 has at most @xmath27 boundary slopes where @xmath28 is the @xmath29th fibonacci number .    in section  7",
    "we outline our method for calculating the maximum and minimum boundary slopes and in section  8 we prove theorem  [ thmain ] .",
    "let us now review the basic ideas of conway notation and continued fractions ( section  2 ) and boundary slopes for @xmath0bridge knots ( section  3 ) .",
    "in this section , we give a brief overview of conway notation , continued fractions , and their relationship .",
    "rational tangles may be constructed by means of tangle algebra ( for example , see adams @xcite ) .",
    "a rational knot is obtained from numerator closure on a rational tangle .",
    "the _ conway notation _ for such a knot is the same as the conway notation for the tangle , i.e. , a list of integers , @xmath30 .",
    "note that the set of rational knots coincides with the set of @xmath0bridge knots and we will use these terms interchangeably .",
    "a _ continued fraction _ of a rational number @xmath31 is a fraction of the form @xmath32,\\ ] ] where @xmath33 and each @xmath34 , for @xmath35 , is a nonzero integer .",
    "note that , since each @xmath34 can be any nonzero integer , the continued fraction for @xmath31 is not unique .",
    "we will call @xmath2 the _ integral component _ of the continued fraction , and each @xmath34 will be called a _ partial quotient _ or _ term _ in the continued fraction",
    ".    we will assume that whenever we discuss a continued fraction @xmath36 $ ] , it does , in fact , evaluate to a rational number .",
    "for example , @xmath37 $ ] is not a valid continued fraction since @xmath38 is not defined as a rational number .",
    "conway notation and continued fractions are related in that we can calculate a rational knot s associated continued fraction by reversing the order of the conway notation .",
    "that is , a knot with conway notation @xmath39 has the continued fraction @xmath40 = \\frac p q$ ]",
    ". we will denote this knot @xmath41 .",
    "in fact ( see cromwell @xcite for a proof ) , all tangles given by conway notation corresponding to the same rational number are equivalent .",
    "passing to knots introduces additional equivalences : two rational knots @xmath42 and @xmath43 are equivalent if and only if @xmath44 .",
    "also , the knots @xmath45 and @xmath46 are mirror reflections of one another .    recall that if , in a continued fraction @xmath47 $ ] , we restrict every @xmath48 , @xmath35 , to be a positive integer , with @xmath49 , then this representation of @xmath31 is unique .",
    "we will call this the _ simple continued fraction _ of @xmath31 . the corresponding rational knot with conway notation",
    "@xmath50 then has crossing number @xmath51 , as is proven by ernst and sumners @xcite .    throughout this paper",
    ", we will use the notation @xmath52 to mean that the pattern `` @xmath53 '' is repeated @xmath2 times , with @xmath2 being any nonnegative integer , e.g. , @xmath54 = [ 0 , -2 , 2 , -2 , 2]$ ] and @xmath55 = [ 0 , 2]$ ] .",
    "in this section , we will briefly review how to calculate boundary slopes for rational knots .",
    "let @xmath56 , or simply @xmath57 , denote the set of all boundary slopes for a knot @xmath6 .",
    "for rational knots @xmath42 , recall @xcite that @xmath57 can be calculated from continued fractions of @xmath31 having every partial quotient at least two in absolute value .",
    "( we will refer to these as _ boundary slope continued fractions_. ) specifically , one takes such a continued fraction and pattern - matches the partial quotients against the pattern @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "the number of terms matching this pattern we call @xmath59 , and the number of terms not matching this pattern ( e.g. , the total number of terms minus @xmath59 ) we call @xmath60 ( since these terms match the pattern @xmath61)$ ] . in this way , we associate to each boundary slope continued fraction two non - negative integers @xmath59 and @xmath60 .    among",
    "the boundary slope continued fractions , there is a unique one consisting only of even terms ( indeed , this is easy to see using the four substitutions we will derive in section 5 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a seifert surface of boundary slope @xmath9 , so we will denote its @xmath59 and @xmath60 by @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "then , the boundary slope associated to any other continued fraction is given by comparing its @xmath59 and @xmath60 with those of the seifert slope ; the boundary slope is @xmath64 .",
    "applying this calculation to every continued fraction with terms at least two in absolute value gives the set of boundary slopes @xmath57 .",

    "again , some of these five sequences may not result in a boundary slope continued fraction , for example , if one of the @xmath48 is @xmath173 .",
    "however , every leaf of the tree will be included in the set of continued fractions obtained by substituting at non - adjacent positions .",
    "* case 4 * ( @xmath96 ) : as in case 3 , we can decompose the binary tree ( figure  [ fig6 ] )    the general case also results in two subtrees . ]    into two subtrees .",
    "one corresponds to sequences that begin with @xmath9 , the other to sequences beginning with @xmath219 .",
    "the first will be , essentially , the tree that arises from the simple continued fraction @xmath222 $ ] . by induction ,",
    "the leaves of this subtree correspond to non - adjacent substitutions in this simple continued fraction . by its placement in the @xmath186 $ ] tree , this ensures that the leaves of this part of the tree will correspond to continued fractions obtained by substitution sequences into @xmath223 $ ] that begin with @xmath9 .",
    "the other subtree is isomorphic to the tree that arises from the simple continued fraction @xmath224 $ ] . by induction ,",
    "the leaves of the subtree correspond to substitutions into this continued fraction .",
    "by its placement in the tree for @xmath225 $ ] , the leaves here can be obtained by non - adjacent substitutions into that continued fraction that begin with @xmath219 .",
    "thus , every leaf of the binary tree and , therefore , every boundary slope continued fraction can be obtained by non - adjacent substitutions into the simple continued fraction . @xmath75",

    "we have shown that the boundary slope continued fractions lie among those given by substitution at non - adjacent positions which in turn are in bijection with sequences of @xmath227 0 s or 1 s containing no pair of consecutive 1 s .",
    "thus the number of boundary slopes is at most @xmath228 , where @xmath228 is the number of @xmath9 , @xmath173 sequences of length @xmath227 with no consecutive 1 s .",
    "we will show that @xmath229 by induction .",
    "there are two base cases .",

    "sequences of length @xmath227 are obtained by either adding a @xmath9 to the beginning of a @xmath29 sequence or @xmath219 to the beginning of a @xmath232 sequence .",
    "thus @xmath233 .",
    "@xmath75    in general , @xmath27 is an overestimate since the continued fractions obtained by substitutions will not necessarily have terms at least two in absolute value .",
    "in particular , if the simple continued fraction includes any 1 s , then the continued fraction obtained by making no substitutions ( @xmath234 ) will not be a boundary slope continued fraction . moreover",
    ", different boundary slope continued fractions could result in the same boundary slope .",
    "for example , this will occur when , in the simple continued fraction , we have two equal terms separated by an even distance : @xmath235 .",
    "in this section , we will show how one can calculate the maximum and minimum boundary slopes .",
    "we will refer to the minimum value of @xmath236 as @xmath237 and the maximum as @xmath238 .",
    "further , we will refer to the components of @xmath237 as @xmath239 and @xmath240 .",

    "the key observation is that , if we begin with a simple continued fraction , applying a substitution at an even position will decrease @xmath241 and , hence , the boundary slope , while applying a substitution at an odd position will increase the boundary slope .",
    "thus , we can minimize the boundary slope by substituting at each even position ( and no odd positions ) . note that this will result in a continued fraction where each term is at least two in absolute value .",
    "indeed , the even position terms of the original simple continued fraction will be replaced by a sequence of @xmath242 s while the terms in the odd positions will be augmented in absolute value by at least one .",
    "however , we need a way to count the resulting @xmath239 and @xmath240 when we make substitutions at each even position .",
    "we will do this by focusing on the clusters of @xmath243 , examining what occurs near them individually , and then summing up the results .",

    "we replace it with @xmath248 or @xmath244 terms and a negative odd @xmath249 is also replaced with @xmath244 terms .",
    "we can combine these cases by observing that a term @xmath48 is replaced with @xmath250 terms .",
    "if we think of making the substitutions at position @xmath9 , @xmath0 , @xmath251 in turn , then , each substitution will not affect the magnitude of later @xmath252 but may change their signs .",
    "thus , if we begin with the simple continued fraction @xmath253 $ ] , each @xmath252 will be replaced by @xmath254 terms .",
    "all we need now , then , is to count the number of terms that appear between the strings of @xmath255 s .",

    "similarly , if @xmath29 is odd , then we must have @xmath259 odd terms . more concisely , there are @xmath260 odd terms .",
    "now , we have all the ingredients necessary to calculate @xmath240 .",
    "@xmath261    so , surprisingly , @xmath240 is equal to the sum of the even terms , less one if @xmath29 is even .",
    "recall that , the simple continued fraction is @xmath262 $ ] so that @xmath29 is one more than the number of partial quotients . note that @xmath263 as all partial quotients are now matched to the @xmath264 $ ] pattern .",
    "similarly , the maximum boundary slope is given by substituting at each odd position , and we can use the exact same logic to find @xmath265 .",
    "in fact , the formula itself is nearly identical .",
    "the sole differences are the terms we sum over , and the fact that we do nt add @xmath266 , but instead @xmath267 .",
    "we then get :    @xmath268    now that we have @xmath237 ( which is @xmath269 , since @xmath270 ) and @xmath238 ( which is simply @xmath265 ) , we can calculate the maximum and minimum boundary slopes in terms of @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
