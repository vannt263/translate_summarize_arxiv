    "recall that given a set @xmath5 and a direction @xmath6 , it s minkowski symmetral is defined to be @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the reflection with respect to the hyperplane @xmath9 .    the minkowski symmetrization @xmath10 results in a set that is symmetric with respect to the hyperplane @xmath9 ,",
    "thus it is natural to expect that successive applications of this procedure in different directions yield a sequence of sets that convergences in some sense to the euclidean ball .",
    "this is indeed known in the case where @xmath5 is convex",
    ". moreover , there are estimates regarding the convergence rate .",
    "bourgain , lindenstrauss and milman @xcite obtained the first quantitative estimate for the convergence rate of minkowski symmetrizations .",

    "the proof of theorem [ thm_mink - isometric ] consists of three steps .",

    "next , we consider minkowski symmetrizations _ of the convex hull _ of our star shaped body .",
    "as mentioned above , for convex bodies klartag showed how many steps are required in order to bring a body isometrically close to the euclidean ball .",
    "we apply these symmetrizations , and get a body whose convex hull lies between two balls of very similar radii .",
    "this can only happen if the body contains some `` @xmath32-net '' of the inner ball s sphere ( lemma [ lem_conv = ball - to - eps - net ] ) . in the third and final step , we use this fact to increase the radius of the small ball , which was obtained in the first step .",
