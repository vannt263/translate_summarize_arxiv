    "multi - dimensional dynamics is , quite literally , at the heart of core - collapse supernovae from massive stars .",
    "decades of theoretical and computational studies have shown that the hydrodynamic shock formed at core bounce always stalls and fails to be revived by neutrino energy deposition in simulations that assume spherical symmetry ( 1d ; @xcite ) .",
    "the advent of detailed axisymmetric ( 2d ) simulations led to the realization that neutrino - driven convection @xcite and the advective - acoustic standing accretion shock instability ( sasi ; @xcite ) may both play an important facilitating role in the neutrino mechanism for core - collapse supernova explosions .",
    "the nonradial dynamics associated with these instabilities can increase the time material spends in the layer near the stalled shock where net neutrino energy absorption occurs ( the `` gain layer '' ) .",
    "this , in turn , increases the neutrino heating efficiency and creates conditions favorable for launching an explosion ( e.g. , @xcite ) . rising convective plumes and large high - entropy bubbles created by sasi - induced secondary shocks can exert mechanical force on the shock and push it out @xcite . as recently pointed out by @xcite and @xcite , turbulent flow , which is both unavoidable and ubiquitous in the gain layer ,",
    "provides an effective pressure that adds to the pressure budget behind the shock and thus further helps the multi - d neutrino mechanism .",
    "the set of recent detailed ab initio 2d neutrino radiation - hydrodynamics simulations yields successful explosions in multiple cases and codes ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but failures in some others ( e.g. , @xcite , who used different approximations for radiation transport and microphysics ) .",
    "one must not rest on the partial 2d success of the neutrino mechanism .",
    "nature is 3d , so are core - collapse supernovae , and so is the multi - d dynamics in their postbounce cores .",
    "3d work was pioneered by the smooth - particle hydrodynamics simulations of @xcite , but grid - based 3d simulations had to await the broad availability of petascale computing resources and have become possible only recently .",
    "most current 3d simulations do not yet reach the level of their 2d counterparts in implemented and captured physics , and in numerical resolution .",
    "yet they are beginning to yield results that elucidate the 3d hydrodynamics of core - collapse supernovae and differences between 2d and 3d ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite carried out the only 3d studies to - date with accurate energy - dependent neutrino transport , which they implement not in 3d , but along many 1d rays .",
    "the angular resolution of these simulations is @xmath22@xmath6 for both hydrodynamics and neutrinos .",
    "current 3d cartesian adaptive - mesh - refinement ( amr ) simulations with a more approximate neutrino treatment reach much finer effective angular resolutions of @xmath7 in the gain layer ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    while there is still much tension between the detailed results ( and their interpretation ) of current 3d simulations obtained with different approximations and codes ,",
    "there is consensus that the development of large - scale , high - entropy regions ( by neutrino heating or sasi ) and , generally , kinetic energy at large scales is required for a neutrino - driven explosion to succeed @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we systematically study the qualitative and quantitative dependence of 3d postbounce hydrodynamics on the strength of neutrino heating and on numerical resolution .",
    "for this , we employ our 3d fully general - relativistic core - collapse supernova simulation code ` zelmani ` introduced in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this code includes a three - species neutrino leakage scheme , which allows us to control the local efficiency of neutrino heating .",
    "we carry out simulations of the postbounce evolution of the @xmath0-@xmath1 progenitor model of @xcite , which has been considered by multiple recent studies .",
    "its structure results in a high postbounce accretion rate , which leads to a small radius of the stalled shock , favoring the development of sasi @xcite .",
    "we are particularly interested in ( _ i _ ) the prominence of 3d neutrino - driven convection and 3d sasi , their interplay , and their dependence on neutrino heating ; ( _ ii _ ) the resolution dependence of postbounce hydrodynamics , neutrino heating , and the development of an explosion ; and ( _ iii _ ) the nature of turbulence under neutrino - driven convection dominated conditions and its dependence on resolution .",
    "we find three general regimes of postbounce 3d hydrodynamics : ( 1 ) neutrino - driven convection and onset of explosion ( for strong neutrino heating ; e.g. , @xcite ) , ( 2 ) initially neutrino - driven convection that subsides and is replaced by strong sasi with spiral modes and no explosion ( for moderate neutrino heating ; consistent with @xcite and @xcite ) , and ( 3 ) complete absence of neutrino - driven convection , sasi - dominated dynamics with spiral modes and no explosion ( for weak neutrino heating ) .",
    "the results of our resolution study show that low numerical resolution artificially damps sasi oscillations in the sasi - dominated case . in the neutrino - driven convection dominated case , we show that low resolution leads to artificially favorable conditions for explosion .",
    "the lower the resolution , the less efficient the cascade of turbulent kinetic energy to small scales ( as previously noted by @xcite on the basis of their simpler `` light - bulb '' simulations ) .",
    "low resolution simulations have higher radial convective kinetic energy and enthalpy fluxes , more buoyant mass in the gain layer , higher neutrino heating rates , larger average shock radii , and transition to explosion earlier than more finely resolved simulations . analyzing the angular spectra @xmath3 of turbulence in our simulations",
    ", we find a scaling @xmath4 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) at spherical harmonic mode @xmath8 that should belong to the inertial range of turbulence . by comparison with the literature on local mildly compressible turbulence",
    ", we argue that our and other global 3d simulations similar to ours do not resolve the inertial range of neutrino - driven turbulent convection .",
    "instead , numerical viscosity creates a bottleneck that hinders the efficient cascade of turbulent kinetic energy to small scales .",
    "energy is thus kept at large scales , which may , incorrectly and artificially , promote explosion .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec : methods ] with a discussion of our numerical approach and lay out our simulation plan in section  [ sec : id ] . in section",
    "[ sec : heating ] , we present results from our simulations in the strong , moderate , and weak neutrino heating regimes and provide detailed analyses of neutrino - driven convection , sasi , and turbulence in these simulations . in section",

    "we simulate core collapse and postbounce evolution of the nonrotating @xmath0-@xmath1 solar - metallicity model of @xcite . we follow collapse , bounce , and the first @xmath9 in spherical symmetry using gr1d @xcite with neutrino leakage and a heating factor @xmath10 ( see below for a definition of @xmath11 ) . at @xmath9 after bounce , the shock has almost stalled .",
    "figure  [ fig : initial_profile ] shows the spherically - symmetric density , specific entropy , and electron fraction @xmath12 profiles at @xmath9 after bounce .",
    "we then map this configuration to our 3d grid and continue the evolution in full 3d .",
    "we choose this 1d3d approach to save computer time during the spherical collapse phase and to avoid having the shock cross the boundaries of the two innermost mesh refinement levels of the 3d grid , which could generate significant numerical error @xcite . by mapping at @xmath2@xmath9",
    ", we miss the earliest part of prompt postbounce convection due to the negative entropy left behind by the weakening shock .",

    "we employ a cubed - sphere multiblock adaptive - mesh - refinement ( amr ) system that consists of a set of overlapping curvilinear grid blocks adapted to the overall spherical geometry of the problem @xcite .",

    ", the grid on the finest amr level has a linear cell width of @xmath16 . the third - finest level containing the entire postshock region and the shock has a linear cell width of @xmath17 .",
    "this corresponds to an effective angular resolution of @xmath18 at @xmath19 and @xmath20 at @xmath21 .",
    "the outer regions are covered by a shell of six angular grid blocks that stretch to @xmath22 .",
    "the angular blocks are arranged such that the two angular coordinate directions at each lateral edge of each block always coincide with those from neighboring patches @xcite .",
    "the angular resolution in those patches is @xmath2@xmath23 , which is sufficient since matter in those regions remains spherically symmetric .",
    "the radial resolution at the inner boundary of the angular patches is chosen to be the same as that of the coarsest amr level , which , for the baseline resolution , is a linear cell width of @xmath24 .",
    "the resolution decreases gradually with radius , reaching @xmath25 at the outer boundary .",

    "however , with decreasing resolution , the bottleneck shifts to progressively lower wavenumbers , consuming more and more of the resolved inertial range . already at @xmath248 , the inertial range is gone and energy injection and dissipation scales are joined directly with @xmath249 . on the basis of their results and previous work by @xcite , @xcite argue that the numerical viscosity of their ppm scheme provides dissipation that affects the flow directly on spatial scales from 2 to @xmath212 times the width of a computational cell .",

    "our baseline @xmath28 model has a resolution on the amr level containing the postshock region and the shock with linear resolution @xmath262 .",

    "the overall trend is very clear : the lower the resolution , the larger the average shock radius , the higher the neutrino heating rate , the greater the heating efficiency , and the larger the mass in the gain layer .    while these overall trends are robust , there are some inconsistencies in detail of note .",

    "their highest resolution roughly corresponds to our ulr case . at such coarse resolutions , which suppress nonradial convective motions ,",
    "it is not at all surprising that the conditions become more favorable for explosion as increasing resolution begins to allow nonradial motions .",
    "the @xcite simulations thus probe the resolution dependence of 3d postbounce hydrodynamics in a completely different regime than our simulations .",
    "figure  [ fig : buoyant_mass ] provides further evidence for why lower resolution simulations are ( artificially ) favorable for neutrino - driven explosions .",

    "we expect that this fraction will sensitively depend on progenitor structure and will be higher in progenitors with lower postbounce accretion rates than in the @xmath0-@xmath1  progenitor that we study here .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : buoyant_mass ] shows the time evolution of the sum of the angle - averaged `` turbulent '' radial fluxes of enthalpy ( @xmath281 , also known as `` convective flux '' ) and kinetic energy ( @xmath282 ) near the shock .",
    "we follow @xcite and @xcite and define @xmath283 where @xmath55 is the density , @xmath176 is the radial velocity , @xmath284 is the internal energy , @xmath285 is the pressure , and @xmath286 is the @xmath287th component of velocity .",
    "all primed quantities represent variations about the angle - averaged mean so that , for instance , @xmath288 measures the amount of the turbulent part of the specific kinetic - energy ( note that by construction @xmath289 , where @xmath290 denotes the angular average ) .",
    "we evaluate the angular integrals in equation  [ eq : turbflux ] at each time at a radius that corresponds to the instantaneous minimum shock radius .",
    "a number of studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) have argued that buoyant convective / turbulent bubbles are locally important in driving shock deformation and expansion . @xcite and @xcite have shown that the additional effective ram pressure due to turbulence is crucial for the relative ease of explosions in 2d and 3d compared with the 1d case .",
    "all these effects are related to the convective / turbulent flux of kinetic energy and enthalphy in the gain layer and near the shock ( cf .",

    "the effective pressure of turbulence at large scales adds to the thermal pressure in the postshock region and facilitates larger shock radii and thus helps explosion @xcite .",
    "if it is indeed energy / power / dynamics at large scales that is needed to revive the stalled shock , then the results of our resolution and turbulence study in this paper do not at all bode well for the standard neutrino mechanism in 3d .",

    "the result is a smaller average shock radius and a slower transition to explosion with increasing resolution .",
    "our model with strong neutrino heating still shows at least the onset of an explosion even in the highest resolution , but in a more critical case , a low - resolution simulation may incorrectly predict an explosion where a higher - resolution simulation does not .",
    "our results , in agreement with the results of the simpler `` light - bulb '' simulations carried out by @xcite , show that the higher the resolution in 3d , the more efficient becomes the turbulent cascade of nonradial kinetic energy to small scales . moreover , comparing our results for the turbulent energy spectra with what is expected from turbulence theory and local simulations of mildly compressible turbulence , we find that even our highest - resolution simulation does not resolve the inertial range of turbulence",
    ". instead , the realization of turbulence in our simulations is likely affected by numerical viscosity all the way up to the scale of energy injection .",
    "this reduces the efficiency of the turbulent cascade to small scales and results in a shallow scaling of the angular energy spectrum .",
    "the same is likely true also for the simulations of @xcite and @xcite , who find similarly shallow scalings .    in our highest - resolution simulation , the turbulent gain layer",
    "is covered by @xmath266 linear computational cell widths .",
    "@xcite argue that the numerical viscosity of the ppm scheme affects regions of up to @xmath232 cell widths and that @xmath236512 linear cell widths across a mildly compressible turbulent region are necessary to resolve any inertial range with ppm .",
    "this would , in the best case , correspond to @xmath2@xmath295 times our current resolution in the gain layer .",
    "should our conclusion be correct , then obtaining neutrino - driven explosions will just get harder when higher - resolution simulations become available that resolve the inertial range and efficiently transport energy to small scales .",
    "the standard neutrino mechanism may then need help to somehow corral energy at large scales and/or a source of additional heating .",
    "for example , large - scale perturbations from precollapse aspherical shell burning were shown by @xcite to boost the vigor of turbulence and thus could help .",

    "the parameter that is used to indicate the onset of turbulence is the physical reynolds number @xmath307 where @xmath8 is a length scale of the flow , @xmath308 is a velocity scale of the flow , and @xmath309 is the physical kinematic viscosity .",
    "laboratory experiments show that the transition from laminar to turbulent float occurs at @xmath310 , depending upon the geometry of the experimental boundaries ( cf .",
    "the kinematic viscosity is related to the efficiency of momentum transport by particles in the fluid . employing the chapman - enskog procedure to first order on the boltzmann equation gives the kinematic viscosity @xmath311 where @xmath312 is the transport cross - section for particles in the fluid ( cf .",
    "therefore , particles which have the smallest total cross section but large average momentum ( i.e. electrons are unlikely to contribute ) will be responsible for the viscosity in the medium .",
    "clearly , neutrons will have the smallest interaction cross section due to their neutrality .",
    "therefore , the kinematic viscosity in the postshock region is given by @xcite ( assuming the thermal debroglie wavelength is greater than the neutron s - wave scattering length @xmath313 ) , @xmath314    the convectively unstable gain layer has a typical length scale of @xmath2@xmath315 and typical velocities of @xmath2@xmath316 .",
    "hence , for @xmath317 and @xmath318 , we obtain an estimate for the physical reynolds number of @xmath319 which is larger than what would be predicted just using the braginskii - spitzer viscosity @xcite and clearly implies the system should be turbulent .",
    "momentum exchange due to neutrino emission , absorption , and scattering has also been invoked as a source of viscosity that can damp turbulent convection in core - collapse supernovae and protoneutron stars .",
    "the neutrino viscosity in the opaque and semi - transparent regimes was estimated by , e.g. , @xcite , and @xcite . here",
    "we provide an estimate of the relevance of neutrino viscosity in the gain region , where neutrinos stream relatively freely .",
    "the specific momentum deposition rate due to neutrino absorption in the gain region can be estimated as @xmath320 where @xmath99 is the electron neutrino luminosity emerging from the neutrinosphere , nuclei are assumed to be dissociated , neutrino  nucleon interactions from @xcite are employed ( electron scattering is neglected ) , @xmath321 is the characteristic neutrino cross section scale defined in @xcite , and the luminosity in all neutrino flavors is assumed equal . since most of these neutrinos propagate in the radial direction ,",
    "momentum will mostly be deposited in that direction",
    ". this will not dampen stochastic turbulent flow , for which momentum needs to be exchanged between turbulent eddies .",
    "however , @xmath322 can still be used as an upper limit for momentum exchange between different turbulent eddies . using ( [ eq : dotp ] )",
    ", one can estimate the timescale for momentum change in the gain region due to @xmath322 : @xmath323 where @xmath285 is the characteristic momentum of the largest turbulent eddies in the gain region and @xmath324 is their characteristic velocity .",
    "the latter is roughly equal to @xmath181 ( equation  [ eq : vaniso ] ) .",
    "the timescale of convective motion of eddies of size @xmath325 in the gain region can be estimated as @xmath326 for @xmath327 , which is a reasonable estimate for the eddy scale , we get @xmath328 , implying that momentum exchange due to neutrinos is unimportant at large scales . at smaller scales ,",
    "the characteristic turbulent eddy velocity is given by ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath329 where @xmath330 is the size of the largest eddies . combining ( [ eq : taumom ] ) and ( [ eq : ulambda ] ) , we get @xmath331 .",
    "the characteristic timescale of turbulent eddies scales with @xmath325 as ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath332 i.e. , @xmath333 decreases with @xmath325 faster than @xmath334 does , hence @xmath334 remains much larger than @xmath333 for any @xmath325 .",
    "in other words , momentum exchange due to neutrinos can not damp turbulence in the gain region .",
    "our simulations do not include any explicit physical viscosity but rely on the viscosity of the numerical scheme to model the unresolved scales of the turbulent cascade , in accordance with the implicit large eddy simulation ( iles ) paradigm @xcite .",
    "the iles procedure has been shown to be robust and accurate for a number of turbulent flows as long as the effective reynolds number , defined as @xmath335 @xmath336 being the `` numerical viscosity '' , is sufficiently large , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "that is , as long as there is a sufficient separation between the energy - containing scale @xmath337 and the dissipation scale @xmath338 .",
    "how large the scale separation should be in order for the iles procedure to reach convergence ( in a statistical sense ) , is problem dependent .",
    "nevertheless it is useful to measure the range of scales covered by our simulations in a quantitative way .",
    "this will also ease the comparison with future simulations .",
    "unfortunately , estimating the effective reynolds number in iles calculations is not trivial because the numerical viscosity does not really behave like a physical viscosity , that is , it can not easily be associated with a given kinematic viscosity coefficient @xmath336 .",
    "instead , it is a complex nonlinear function of the hydrodynamic quantities .",
    "nevertheless , in the framework of kolmogorov s theory of turbulence , it is possible to construct measures of the reynolds number that do not explicitly depend on @xmath336 . in particular , our estimate of the reynolds number is based on the taylor length  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath339 where @xmath340 is the enstrophy @xmath341 and @xmath342 is the total energy @xmath343 in the incompressible limit , the average kinetic energy dissipation rate is related to the enstrophy via the relation @xmath344 where @xmath309 is the kinematic viscosity .",
    "furthermore , in kolmogorov s theory of turbulence the energy dissipation rate is assumed to be @xmath345 where @xmath346 is of order one ( here assumed to be @xmath347 ) and @xmath337 is the integral scale , i.e. ,  the scale of energy containing eddies .",
    "substituting , , and into and using the definition of the reynolds number , we obtain @xmath348    we compute the enstrophy in our numerical data as @xmath349 where @xmath350 is the radius at which the spectra are computed and we restrict our calculation to @xmath351 , because , for @xmath352 , the floating point precision necessary to compute the associated legendre functions can exceed the limits of the double precision employed in our analysis code . in computing , we used the fact that the @xmath353 factor in the fourier expansion corresponds to ( minus ) the laplacian in the physical space and that , by definition , @xmath354 so that a @xmath353 factor in the fourier expansion corresponds to a @xmath355 factor in the angular expansion .",
    "@xmath342 is computed in a similar way to @xmath340 , summing the angular expansion coefficients of the energy ( equation ) up to @xmath356 . from the values of @xmath340 and @xmath342",
    ", we can infer @xmath357 for model @xmath30 at @xmath229 after bounce .",
    "the taylor length is sometimes interpreted as being the radius of the smallest coherent structures of the turbulent flow , so it is not surprising that we find @xmath325 to be roughly @xmath358 cells , close to the scale at which we expect numerical dissipation to be too strong for coherent structures to persist .",
    "ccccc @xmath26 & 0.92 & 68.80 & 21.08 & 53.25 + @xmath27 & 1.56 & 65.37 & 18.55 & 62.06 + @xmath28 & 1.82 & 60.97 & 16.52 & 68.14 + @xmath29 & 2.05 & 62.57 & 16.45 & 70.03 + @xmath30 & 2.33 & 61.55 & 16.20 & 72.21 [ tab : reynolds.number ]    as a sanity check , we can use another identity for @xmath253 @xcite : @xmath365 from which we find the effective dissipation scale to be @xmath366 .",
    "this value is of the same order as the grid spacing , meaning that the two estimates ( [ eq : reynolds.number.1 ] ) and ( [ eq : reynolds.number.2 ] ) for the reynolds number are roughly consistent with each other , which lends additional credence to our estimate of @xmath253 .",
    "table [ tab : reynolds.number ] collects @xmath338 , @xmath337 , @xmath325 and @xmath253 as computed from different resolutions .",
    "as expected , the effective reynolds number increases slowly with resolution : the integral scale , @xmath337 , stays roughly constant ( with the exception of the @xmath26 model ) , while @xmath325 decreases .",
    "the dissipation scale , and hence the numerical viscosity at the grid scale , seems to be increasing with the resolution .",
    "a similar effect was also reported , at much higher resolutions and for different problems , by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "its origins are unclear @xcite , but it is again a reminder that numerical viscosity can behave very differently from the physical viscosity .",
    "the reynolds numbers reported in table  [ tab : reynolds.number ] are disappointingly low , but this is not unexpected given the very low resolution ( @xmath266 linear cell widths across the turbulent region in even our highest - resolution simulation ) that our global simulations provide .",
    "note that , since we restricted our calculation of @xmath340 to @xmath367 , we are systematically underestimating the enstrophy .",
    "this means that we might be underestimating the actual value of the effective reynolds number @xcite .",
    "however , we point out that our measure is probably also affected by other uncertainties , such as in the determination of @xmath337 , and , more importantly , by possible systematic errors coming from the fact that we rely on the validity of kolmogorov theory of turbulence , which has not yet been verified in the context of neutrino - driven convection . given all of these uncertainties , our estimate of the reynolds number should only be taken as an order of magnitude indication .",
    "we remark that other approaches for measuring the reynolds number have been proposed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , these rely either on uncertain estimates of the numerical viscosity or on explicit measures of the kinetic energy dissipation rate .",
    "the latter are difficult to carry out in complex simulations where gravity , radiation , and compressible effects are all present and must be accounted for ."
