    "according to canonical stellar evolution models , the by - products of the nuclear processing around the hydrogen - burning shell ( h  shell ) of low - mass red - giant - branch ( rgb ) stars should remain confined to the stellar interior ; however , observations over the past 25 years have shown star - to - star variations in the elements c , n , o , na , mg and al , among others , on the surfaces of globular cluster red giants ( see kraft 1994 , briley et al . 1994 and",
    "cavallo 1998a for detailed reviews of the observations ) .",
    "in particular , the data show evidence of the cno cycle that dominates the energy production in such stars : c and o are anticorrelated with n , while the @xmath2c/@xmath3c ratio is near the equilibrium value of 4 in many clusters @xcite .",
    "while the first dredge - up phenomenon @xcite does alter the carbon and nitrogen abundances slightly , it can not account for the observed large variations of these elements and their isotopic ratios , nor can it account for the variations of the other elements .",
    "in addition , some elements show evidence for gradual changes along the rgb , indicating that something is occurring during the course of evolution to facilitate these alterations . for example , c becomes more depleted with decreasing @xmath4 in the clusters m  15 , m  55 , m  92 and ngc  6397 @xcite .",
    "two separate approaches have been developed to address the observations .",
    "one assumes that some form of non - canonical mixing occurs along the rgb , which gradually brings material from around the h  shell to the stellar surface ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , sm79 ) .",
    "models by sm79 , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , csb98 ) have shown that most variations along the brighter part of the rgb can be explained by nuclear processing around the h  shell combined with mixing .",
    "the source of mixing is generally assumed to be rotationally induced meridional circulation currents ( sm79 ) ; although , other theories abound @xcite .",
    "the observations by @xcite that show the horizontal - branch ( hb ) stars in m  13 , a cluster with large variations of oxygen and aluminum on the rgb , rotating nearly a factor of two faster than the hb stars in m  3 , a cluster with a composition similar to m  13 , but with less extreme abundance variations along it s rgb , support the sm79 hypothesis .",
    "the second approach assumes that some of the variations , particularly those of the heavier elements , are primordial in nature , perhaps originating in the processed envelopes of intermediate - mass asymptotic - giant - branch ( agb ) stars that were shed into the nascent cluster environment @xcite .",
    "while it has been shown that this scenario can not account for all the variations @xcite , some aspects of it are plausible in light of the data .",
    "for example , observations of cn - band strength and sodium variations on the upper main sequence of 47  tuc , sodium enhancements on the subgiant branch of m  92 and enhancements in the neutron - capture elements in some clusters all point to primordial origins @xcite .",
    "the most likely solution to the abundance anomaly problem probably involves a combination of both scenarios , where primordial pollution is present in the cluster , but mixing later plays a role in adjusting the abundance patterns ( see , e.g. , denissenkov et al . 1998 and",
    "briley et al . 1999 ) , an approach we examine here .",
    "this paper focuses on determining the chemical abundances in the red giants of the globular clusters m  3 ( ngc  5272 ) and m  13 ( ngc  6205 ) from high resolution , high signal - to - noise echelle spectra obtained with the mayall 4-meter telescope on kitt peak .",
    "we choose these two clusters because they are often considered a classical `` second - parameter '' pair since they have markedly different hb s , despite having similar [ fe / h ]  = log(x / y)@xmath5  @xmath6  log(x / y)@xmath7 . ]",
    "values , the first parameter .",
    "we discuss the hypothesis that deep mixing along the rgb , which we define as mixing that penetrates the h  shell , brings helium to the surface and affects the hb morphology as a second parameter that creates the extended blue tail in m  13 @xcite .",
    "one oft - quoted choice for the second parameter is a relative age difference between m  3 and m  13 @xcite ; however , this is not borne out by the photometry @xcite and leaves open the need for a qualified alternative .",
    "while m  13 is by far the most well - studied cluster for abundance variations , the data for m  3 are lacking .",
    "one goal of this paper is to increase our knowledge of the chemical abundances in this latter cluster so that it can be compared with m  13 in greater detail .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : we describe the observations , data reduction approach , abundance analysis technique and abundance results in sections 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 , respectively . in section 5",
    "we discuss evidence for and the implications of deep mixing along the rgb , and we give our conclusions in section 6 . in the appendix",
    "we derive the instantaneous mixing algorithm that is used in section 5 .",
    "we chose five bright giants in m  3 ( mb  4 , vz  205 , vz  297 , vz  1000 and vz  1127 ) and three in m  13 ( l  262 , l  324 and l  414 ) from previous studies by the `` lick / texas '' group @xcite that show evidence for abundance variations but have no information regarding aluminum .",
    "the observations were made on the nights of 29 - 31 may 1998 using the echelle spectrograph on the mayall 4-meter telescope .",
    "the echelle setup used - echelle grating 31.6 - 63 , cross grating 226 - 1 , long - focus camera and the t2 kb ccd - resulted in continuous spectral coverage between 5500   and 8800   at a dispersion of 0.08  per ccd pixel , i.e. resolution , r@xmath8 30,000 at 6000  over a 2.5 pixel resolution element . the central wavelength on the ccd was chosen to maximize the signal - to - nose ratio near the @xmath96696 , 6698  al i lines .",
    "the seeing was typically between 1 and 12 on all three nights , causing us to use a slit - width of 15 , and a slit length of 75 .",
    "each 4 @xmath10 30 min .",
    "exposure of a target star was sandwiched between two 15 s exposures of a thar comparison lamp , which was observed at the same telescope position and slit position angle ( p.a . ) . to facilitate subtraction of telluric lines we observed one or two fast rotating b stars each night at various airmasses .",
    "in addition to our data , dr . m. briley provided us with the reduced spectrum of the m  3 giant aa and a fast rotating b star , taken on 21 march 1998 with the mcdonald observatory 2.7-m telescope and 2d - coude echelle spectrograph .",
    "his set - up yielded an non - continuous wavelength coverage from 4070  to 10,500  with @xmath11 50,000 over a resolution element .",
    "a log of all the observations with estimates of the signal - to - noise ratio around the @xmath96696 , 6698  al i region is given in table 1 .",
    "the photometry is from @xcite for m  3 and from @xcite for m  13 .",
    "the locations of the program stars in their respective color - magnitude diagrams are given in figure 1 for m  3 and figure 2 for m  13 . in the following discussions , we refer to each star by its",
    "most commonly used identification , which in some cases is its alternate name .",
    "the data were reduced using standard iraf@xcite tasks ( version 2.11.1 ) , following the reduction procedure outlined in `` users guide to reducing echelle spectra with iraf '' , by d. wilmarth & j. barnes .",
    "zero frames were taken on each night , but since @xmath12 99.9% of the pixels had zero values within the 5 e@xmath13 r.m.s .",
    "noise of the t2 kb ccd , we only zero - corrected `` hot '' ( zero values @xmath12 5 e@xmath13 ) pixels .",
    "quartz flat exposures were taken on each of the three nights and used to flat field the target stars and to determine `` dead '' pixels .",
    "after initial processing of the ccd target star data , we used the iraf task apscatter to correct for scattered light between the orders .",
    "the orders were then extracted to single dimensional spectra using the task apsum with variance weighting , and then wavelength calibrated using the closest ( in time ) thar spectrum , taken at the same telescope position and slit p.a . as the target star .",
    "orders that contained telluric lines were corrected using the task telluric and a comparison spectrum of a fast - rotating b star that was observed at an airmass similar to the program star .",
    "finally , each spectrum was shifted into the rest frame and flattened by fitting a spline through the continuum .",
    "the spectrum for the star m  3 aa was given to us in its extracted form and required only correction for telluric lines in some orders .",
    "figure 3 shows the spectra around the al  i region for all the m  3 and m  13 giants .",
    "the variation in the al  i line strengths is quite apparent from one star to the next .",

    "the free spectral range for the mayall 4-meter data is less than the width of the ccd so that each line appears at least twice in our spectra , with one line usually towards the center of the chip where the noise is minimized .",

    "we measured the equivalent widths of the line closer to the center of the ccd and present the results in table 2 ( found after * references * ) .",

    "the iron lines were chosen from kurucz s cd - rom  # 23 and the solar atlas of @xcite .",
    "they were used to determine both the iron abundances and the model - atmosphere parameters and were thus selected to have a broad range in excitation potentials and oscillator strengths , which were adopted without modification from the empirically derived tables of @xcite and @xcite for the fe  i and fe  ii lines , respectively .",
    "we rejected fe i lines that were listed by @xcite as showing blends with other iron lines or uncertainties in their energy levels of more than 0.005 @xmath14 .",
    "for the sake of comparison , we measured the equivalent widths of our chosen iron lines in the visible and near - infrared solar spectra of @xcite and folded them through the @xcite solar model atmosphere with a microturbulent velocity of 1.0  km s@xmath15 .",
    "we adjusted the log @xmath16 s to reproduce an assumed solar iron abundance of log  @xmath17(x ) = log n(x / h ) + 12.00 , where n is the number abundance .",

    "texas studies we adopt the 7.52 value . ] .",
    "this results in an average difference between the two sets of oscillator strengths ( in the sense of solar model @xmath6 laboratory ) of @xmath18 for fe i and @xmath19 for fe ii ( see table 3 ) .",
    "both differences show a slight trend toward lower oscillator strengths from the laboratory measurements ( @xmath20 ) , which in turn would cause the determined iron abundances to be overestimated by 0.09 and 0.05 dex from the fe i and fe ii lines , respectively .      in the main panel of figure 4",
    "we compare the equivalent widths of our iron lines with those from the earlier lick / texas studies .",
    "the solid line in the figure has a 45 degree slope and represents perfect agreement between the two data sets . the lick / texas data tend toward higher equivalent widths relative to our data , especially above @xmath21100 m .",
    "the average differences between the two data sets ( in the sense of lick / texas @xmath6 present work ) are 6.9 @xmath22 9.7 m for fe i and 5.9 @xmath22 9.7 m for fe ii .",
    "we attribute the differences to several factors .",
    "first , our present data have higher signal - to - noise ratios than the lick / texas data ( 90 to 160 compared with 40 - 100 ) , which reduces the level of uncertainty in placing the continuum .",
    "second , the lick / texas spectra have higher resolution , @xmath23 compared with @xmath24 , which helps separate lines from the continuum and other lines .",
    "third , the two datasets were reduced using two separate software packages that apply scattered - light corrections differently ( see , e.g. , sneden et al .",
    "1991 ) , which can affect the continuum levels and depths of each line .",
    "fourth , measuring equivalent widths is subjective and two different observers can get different results from the same data .",
    "for example , the inset in figure 4 shows the equivalent widths for two separate observations of the m  13 giant iii-56 by the lick / texas group and demonstrates how much variability can be present in the data even with consistent reduction techniques ( see also kraft et al .",
    "1993 , figure 1 ) .",
    "fifth , the methods of measuring equivalent widths differ : we use both a simpson s rule technique ( i.e. , direct integration ) and gaussian fits , while the lick / texas results come from gaussian fits for their earlier papers and both techniques for @xcite .",
    "we determined the oscillator strengths for the other elements in our study by measuring the equivalent widths in the solar spectrum and adjusting the log @xmath16 values until we derived the @xcite solar abundances using the @xcite solar model .",
    "table 3 lists the average differences between the values we determined and the literature values , which are mostly from @xcite , who did a similar differential analysis using an older solar spectrum with a marcs @xcite solar model and a microturbulent velocity of 0.6 km s@xmath15 . with the exception of the mn i lines",
    ", we used our derived log @xmath16 s to derive the elemental abundances .",

    "the equivalent widths were folded through models that were built using the marcs code based on the atmospheric parameters that were initially derived via photometry @xcite .",
    "the models were assumed to have [ fe / h ]  =  @xmath181 , while , as with the models from this present study , the [ @xmath42/fe ] ratio was also assumed to be enhanced by @xmath1540.4 dex . as shown in tables 5 , 6 and 7 , models based on photometric indices can lead to a wider range of abundances ; although , we believe the wiyn models to be well - determined since they were iteratively corrected with the spectra .    of the twelve other stars in the wiyn sample that did not have measurable lines , one , ii-76 , had an aluminum abundance previously determined in the literature ; [ al / fe ]  =  @xmath182 @xcite .",

    "1996 for details ) .",
    "for example , our models are 40 - 60  k hotter , have gravities that are 0.35 - 0.45 dex lower and microturbulent velocities that are 0.09 - 0.13 km  s@xmath15 higher . in addition",

    "finally , the sample was then augmented with [ al / fe ] values taken from the literature @xcite , bringing the total number of stars with determined [ al / fe ] values to 85 .",
    "we believe that the systematic errors that might be present in the data are mostly removed before combination since , with the exception of @xcite for two stars , they are derived by the same group of lick / texas observers who practice consistent reduction techniques .",
    "small differences will arise as the telescopes and instruments are varied , but the lick / texas observers do compare their various observations and show little scatter among their results . if one adds the eleven stars with the assumed low [ al / fe ] values , the total sample size is 96 , covering a range from the tip of the rgb at @xmath183 to @xmath184 , with complete coverage of the @xcite photometry for @xmath185 .",
    "the data are plotted in figure 9a as a function of @xmath4 magnitude , where the eleven stars with [ al / fe ] assumed to be 0 are shown as open circles .",
    "the [ al / fe ] values of giants with multiple measurements were averaged together after being normalized by [ fe / h ] .    in figure 9c",
    "we show a histogram of the distribution of [ al / fe ] for the entire sample of 96 m  13 giants . from this figure",
    ", we see an apparent gap between [ al / fe ]  =  0.2 and 0.4 , indicating that the distribution might be bimodal .",
    "we test for bimodality by applying the kmm algorithm of @xcite , which tests the null hypothesis that a single gaussian is a good description of the data by comparing the fit of a single - peaked distribution to one with multiple modes .",
    "the algorithm returns a @xmath186-value that describes the confidence level of the single - mode fit , where @xmath187 indicates that a single gaussian can be rejected at better than the 95% confidence level , which is generally accepted as strongly consistent with the multimodal distribution .",
    "testing for a bimodal distribution in our sample gives @xmath188 with means in [ al / fe ] of @xmath189 for the `` al - normal '' peak and @xmath190 for the `` al - enhanced '' peak .",
    "the number of stars in each distribution is 65 and 31 for the al - enhanced and al - normal groups , respectively , giving a ratio of al - enhanced to al - normal stars ( hereafter , the `` al ratio '' ) of @xmath191 , where the error is estimated from poissonian statistics .",
    "it is possible that our assumption concerning the actual [ al / fe ] values of stars with no measurable al  i lines can introduce a bias into our statistics .",
    "for example , @xcite report an upper limit of 20  m for equivalent width measurements of lower luminosity giants . applying this measurement to the star k  272 , which has @xmath192 , and using the model parameters supplied by @xcite , we obtain [ al / fe ]  @xmath193  0.88 , assuming [ fe / h ]  =  @xmath61.49 .",
    "we test the effect of this bias by subjecting just the 85 giants with actual aluminum measurements to the kmm algorithm , yielding a @xmath186-value of 0.002 , with an al - ratio of @xmath194 .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that removal of the uncertain data still results in a strongly bimodal distribution .",
    "the only real solution to correct this possible bias is to make higher signal - to - noise observations .",
    "if deep mixing is occurring on the rgb , then the al ratio should be a function of magnitude , increasing with decreasing @xmath4 . to test this hypothesis we bin the data by magnitude and apply the kmm algorithm to each bin to determine whether the distribution in each bin is bimodal and , if it is , the al ratio .",
    "the kmm algorithm requires that the number of data points be greater than 50 , forcing the size of magnitude bins to be rather wide ( @xmath195 ) in order to ensure that enough stars are included for reliable statistics .",
    "we began our binning at @xmath196 , one magnitude lower than the brightest star in the sample , and shift each bin by 0.1 magnitude up to @xmath197 , one magnitude brighter than the lowest luminosity star in the sample .",
    "this choice of bins avoids adding empty points along the rgb into our statistics ; although , it reaches magnitudes where the sample is incomplete . according to the kmm algorithm ,",
    "the aluminum distribution in each magnitude bin is bimodal , with all @xmath186 values less than 0.013 and most less than 0.004 . in figure 9e we show the al ratio ( with poissonian error bars ) as a function of the central magnitude of each bin .",
    "the mean of the 15 points between @xmath198 and 14.5 is 1.99 , which is shown as the solid horizontal line in figure 9e .",
    "the al ratios in the second brightest and brightest magnitude bins are 2.9 and 3 .",
    "the upturn at the brighter magnitudes is due to both an increase in the number of al - enhanced stars and a decrease in the number of al - normal stars , as can be seen in figure 9a , and is consistent with mixing occurring along the rgb ; although , the error bars do not allow for a definitive conclusion in this regard .",
    "we now compare the m  13 data with those from m  3 , where the number of giants with measured al abundances is substantially smaller .",
    "although we augment our sample of six giants in m  3 with an additional four that were observed by ( * ? ?",
    "* none in common with our sample ) , the numbers are still too small to apply the kmm algorithm ; however , as shown in figure 10a , the m  3 [ al / fe ] distribution appears bimodal , with an al ratio of @xmath199 .",
    "this is consistent with the presumably unmixed dimmer giants in m  13 , suggesting that deep mixing is not occurring in m  3 .",
    "we incorporated the [ na / fe ] data from our three m  13 giants with the literature values @xcite to build a database containing 119 m  13 rgb stars with measured sodium abundances , which we show in figure 9b as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "again , we believe the systematic errors associated with the combination of various data sets to be minimized for the reasons outlines in the previous section . as demonstrated in figures 9a and 9b , and in figure 11 for a subset of stars that have both [ al / fe ] and [ na / fe ] values determined , the range in [ na / fe ] is not as wide as in the [ al / fe ] data , with the [ na / fe ] values being both more negative for `` low '' sodium stars and not as enhanced for the `` high '' sodium stars .",
    "however , from figure 9b it is clear that the tip of the rgb does lack sodium - poor giants , if [ na / fe ]  =  0 can be considered a high value relative to the rest of the low - na distribution .",
    "a histogram of the total sodium distribution is shown in figure 9d , where two peaks are apparent , but with no obvious gap between them .",
    "however , application of the kmm algorithm does indicate a bimodal distribution ( @xmath200 ) with two peaks at [ na / fe ]  =  @xmath60.09  @xmath22  0.13 and @xmath1540.29  @xmath2010.13 .",
    "the low sodium group has 33 members , while the high sodium group has 86 , for a ratio of na - enhanced to na - poor giants ( hereafter , the  na ratio `` '' ) of 2.61  @xmath202 . since the peaks are not widely separated ( 2.93 @xmath100 )",
    ", it is difficult to determine to which group stars between the peaks belong , making the above ratio less certain .",
    "the kmm algorithm provides two group membership probabilities ( gmps ) for each star , which give the percentage probability that a value belongs to `` high '' and `` low '' mode ( the sum of the gmps for each star equals 100% ) . for the sample of m  13 giants , 35 stars ( 30% )",
    "have both gmps between 10% and 90% , indicating that these stars can not be assigned to either mode with high confidence .    when we bin the [ na / fe ] values by magnitude , as with the [ al / fe ] data , the bimodality of the distribution within each bin is not as certain as with the entire sample .",
    "we demonstrate this in figure 9f , where we show the na ratio for m  13 in two - magnitude wide bins .",
    "the open triangles in this figure represent ratios where the @xmath186-values are greater than 0.05 , indicating that a unimodal gaussian is not easily ruled out as the `` true '' parent distribution .",
    "the filled - in triangles at @xmath203 represent apparently bimodal distributions ; however , the stars at these lower magnitudes are undersampled , confounding efforts to determine the nature of the [ na / fe ] distribution in m  13 .",
    "despite the uncertainty at lower magnitudes , the [ na / fe ] distribution for the brighter m  13 giants is likely bimodal according the kmm statistics and is similar to that of the [ al / fe ] distribution .",
    "the mean of the 14 dimmest points is 2.33 , represented by the solid line in figure 9f .",
    "relative to the mean , the upturn at @xmath198 appears real and is due to the lack of low - sodium stars @xmath204 , as seen in figure 9b .",
    "we compare the distribution of sodium in m  3 with that of m  13 . as with the aluminum data , the sample size is small , with only fourteen m  3 stars having determined [ na / fe ] values @xcite , six of which are also determined above .",
    "we believe the systematic differences among the lick / texas results and between our data and theirs that arise from the use of different telescopes , instruments and reduction techniques are not significant enough to affect the interpretation of the results .",
    "as can be seen in figure 10b the distribution is fairly flat with eight stars having [ na / fe ]  @xmath205 and only three with [ na / fe ]  @xmath206 .",
    "this is more consistent with limited mixing , but the numbers are much too small to draw realistic conclusions .",
    "referring again to figure 11 , we look for a correlation between sodium and aluminum in m  13 by comparing the 62 giants with measured values of both [ al / fe ] and [ na / fe ] .",
    "the data appear correlated , with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.723 , which according the probability coefficient given in appendix c of @xcite , is `` highly significant '' for this sample size .",
    "we do note , however , that at [ al / fe]@xmath207 , the full range of [ na / fe ] values is present , making the correlation suspicious around this narrow range of [ al / fe ] values .    applying the kmm algorithm to just these 62 stars reveals that both the aluminum and sodium distributions are bimodal , with each having @xmath188 , and an al ratio and a na ratio both equal to 3.13  @xmath208 . to test",
    "whether the identical ratios are just coincidence or if indeed , a star with high [ al / fe ] is likely to have high [ na / fe ] and vice - versa , we examine the difference in the gmps between the aluminum and sodium data for the `` high '' modes , as shown in the histogram in figure 12 .    if the abundances of aluminum and sodium are correlated then the difference between the gmps will be close to zero , as seems to be the case for most giants since 52 stars fall between @xmath60.10 and @xmath1540.10 .",
    "however , ten deviate from zero by more than 0.25 ; so that while figure 12 indicates that only two or three giants do not fit into the correlation around [ al / fe ]  =  @xmath209 , the kmm algorithm actually shows that this number is larger and that around 16% of the sample are not statistically correlated .",
    "we must also reiterate that the [ al / fe ] values from the wiyn sample are not always well - determined and these numbers are likely to change with better data .",
    "in general , the correlation between [ al / fe ] and [ na / fe ] seems fairly constrained ; however , we suggest that when testing for deep mixing , aluminum is a better element to observe than sodium since the data show that the distinction between high and low [ al / fe ] is clearer and the models suggest that aluminum is produced much closer to the h shell than sodium . according to the models , the appearance of _ mixing - enhanced _ aluminum on the surface of a star should imply the existence of extra sodium , while the converse is not necessarily true .",
    "the fact that the data show that 84% of the time the abundance of one element is a predictor of the other indicates just how deeply mixed the m  13 giants probably are .",
    "enhanced aluminum abundances at magnitudes much lower than the tip of rgb are difficult to explain with mixing models since the peak temperature of the h  shell is not high enough to produce a significant amount of aluminum at this stage of evolution @xcite .",
    "what then is the source of the high aluminum abundances at these lower luminosities ?",
    "some have suggested that the h  shell might become unstable at lower magnitudes due to rotation and can undergo flashes that result in peak temperatures near 70 mk or higher @xcite , as opposed to the canonical temperatures below 60 mk ( see , e.g. , csb98 ) .",
    "this hot temperature was chosen specifically by @xcite because it reproduces the observed abundance anomalies in some m  13 giants , particularly the @xmath179 mg depletions and aluminum enhancements observed by @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , such an exercise depends strongly on the accuracy of the nuclear reaction rates , which , in many cases , are not very well determined [ see , e.g. , the nacre @xcite compilation ] . also , in addition to the fact that the h - shell instabilities have yet to be demonstrated in rgb models , it is not clear what the effects of such flashes would be on the structure and evolution of a star . for example",
    ", would these flashes have observable consequences that affect the rgb luminosity function , which is generally well - reproduced by canonical evolutionary models ?",
    "furthermore , the instability scenario of @xcite only applies to the lower rgb @xcite , which is at odds with the data reported here that show aluminum and sodium enhancements occur towards the tip of the rgb ; if these elements were being produced on the lower rgb via hot flashes , the al and na ratios would vary at lower magnitudes . in the case of the @xcite scenario , which involves continually peeling off layers of the core and completely disrupting the h  shell ,",
    "it is not clear how stars can evolve up the rgb and not have serious consequences for the observed luminosity functions of clusters in which the rgb members experience deep mixing .",
    "we suggest that a more favorable location for hot hydrogen burning is around the h  shell of intermediate - mass ( @xmath210 ) agb stars ( referred to as ims ) , which undergo hot bottom burning ( hbb ) , so called because the convective envelope is in contact with the h  shell .",
    "the ims could have shed their nuclearly processed envelopes that include enhanced aluminum and sodium abundances into the early cluster environment @xcite , creating the observed abundance distributions .",
    "for example , the bimodality of [ al / fe ] values on the lower rgb would be created if the ejecta were distributed locally .",
    "likewise , the [ na / fe ] distribution in both clusters is explained if the ims envelopes were also enriched in sodium .",
    "unfortunately , detailed and accurate aluminum and sodium abundance yields from metal - poor agb evolution models are non - existent ; but the high temperatures of hbb in ims , and the observations themselves , lend some weight to this hypothesis .      we have taken the models described in csb98 and subjected them to a deep mixing algorithm that assumes that the mixing is instantaneous ; i.e. , the mixing timescale is the same as the nuclear burning timescale .",
    "a complete derivation of our algorithm is given in the appendix .",
    "while this simplified approach is unable to mimic a realistic mixing timescale , it does have several advantages : 1 ) it can give an upper limit to the amount of variation an element can experience due to nuclear processing , 2 ) it can show the lowest point on the rgb where an element can be processed and 3 ) it can be used to check the effect of the uncertainties in the nuclear reaction rates on the envelope abundances @xcite .",
    "we discuss the first two points after a brief description of the algorithm .",
    "the nuclear reaction network employed in the mixing algorithm is the same as the one used in csb98 with the following modifications .",
    "we use updated rates for the @xmath178mg@xmath211al reaction that have been provided to us by c. rowland .",
    "her rates are 1 ) approximately 10 - 16 times faster than the nacre rates @xcite , 2 ) 1.5 to 4.5 times faster than the rates used in csb98 and 3 ) commensurate with the @xcite tables in the range of @xmath212 , where @xmath213  k. the @xmath178al proton - capture rate has been separated into the short - lived isomeric state , @xmath214al , and the meta - stable ground state , @xmath215al ( this had a negligible impact on the conclusions drawn in csb98 ) .",
    "the nacre compilation shows that the @xmath215al proton - capture rate is uncertain by three orders of magnitude , the effects of which are discussed in the conclusions .",
    "we use the rates for the @xmath179mg@xmath216al reaction that have been updated by @xcite , who measured the resonance parameters of the e@xmath217  =  223  kev resonance to show that the low - energy contribution to the total rate does not significantly increase this rate as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the new rates show a 32% increase over the commonly used @xcite rates in the range of @xmath212 , which is not enough to account for the observed depletions of @xmath179 mg in a handful of m  13 and ngc  6752 giants observed by @xcite .",
    "the initial abundances that we put into our algorithm are those of @xcite , who suggest using [ @xmath177mg / fe]@xmath218  dex as the result of agb contamination , while the initial [ @xmath179mg / fe ] and [ @xmath178mg / fe ] both equal 0 .",
    "this suggestion is further backed by recent results of @xcite who find the overproduction of @xmath177 mg and @xmath178 mg relative to @xmath179 mg in metal - poor agb models .",
    "in addition , we enhance the other @xmath42  elements by @xmath219 dex .",
    "we assume mixing begins on the part of the rgb where the h  shell burns through the hydrogen discontinuity left behind after the first dredge - up , in accordance with the assumption that large @xmath220 barriers can prevent mixing at earlier epochs ( sm79 ) .",
    "this point along the rgb corresponds to the well - known `` bump '' in the luminosity function @xcite . supporting this choice are the theoretical mixing models by @xcite that also assumed mixing begins at this point and reproduced the observed variations of the @xmath2c/@xmath3c ratio , @xmath221li and the @xmath2c/@xmath222n ratio in both open and globular clusters .",
    "in addition , the observations of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite also support this choice for the onset of mixing .",
    "we do point out that not all observations support this choice as the onset mixing @xcite , however , the exact start of deep mixing will little affect our final results .",
    "the timestep for nuclear processing fixes the timestep for mixing and is controlled by setting a limit on how fast any element above a minimum abundance threshold may vary .",
    "since this timestep is much shorter than the time difference between the models used in csb98 , new models were interpolated along the rgb until the he flash was encountered .",
    "the free parameters in our code are @xmath223 , the mixing depth defined by a change in the h - mass fraction , @xmath224 , within the h  shell , and @xmath225 , reimers mass - loss parameter @xcite .",
    "the algorithm was run with various combinations of mixing depths and mass - loss rates for a stellar evolution sequence having [ fe / h]@xmath226 .",
    "figure 13 shows the [ al / fe ] values derived from our algorithm as a function of absolute magnitude , parameterized by various mixing depths and mass - loss rates .",
    "the absolute magnitude scale was derived from the bolometric luminosity , @xmath227 , and @xmath36 provided by the models .",
    "we first converted log ( @xmath228 ) into the bolometric magnitude , m@xmath229 , using the sun as a reference with a value of 4.75 for m@xmath230 .",
    "next , we used the following relationship between gravity , @xmath38 , mass , @xmath231 , @xmath36 and @xmath227 to obtain log @xmath38 for each model : @xmath232 where a value of t@xmath233 is assumed .",
    "mass loss is implicitly accounted for via the first term on the right hand side of equation 1 . using a 12 gyr isochrone with [ fe / h ]  =  @xmath61.67 ,",
    "also constructed by drs .",
    "vandenberg and bell , we interpolated according to log @xmath38 to find a bolometric correction then converted m@xmath229 into m@xmath234 .",
    "we show the results for @xmath223 = 0.05 , 0.10 , 0.15 and 0.20 , and for @xmath225 = 0.0 , 0.2 , 0.4 and 0.6 at each @xmath223 , as described in the figure caption .",
    "according to figure 13 , the dominant parameter for determining [ al / fe ] at the rgb tip is the mixing depth .",
    "mass loss plays a secondary role for deeply mixed models but is more important for less deeply mixed models .",
    "the importance of @xmath225 is controlled by a competition between the timescale for mass loss and the timescale for converting magnesium into aluminum : for a given sequence , the mass - loss timescale is fixed by @xmath225 , so that with deeper mixing , the mg - burning timescale decreases , bringing the two closer together and limiting the influence of mass loss",
    ". thus , in the limit of instantaneous mixing , the distribution of [ al / fe ] near the tip of the rgb is due primarily to variations in the mixing depth ; although , for the deeply mixed sequences , the value of [ al / fe ] at the tip begins to saturate .",
    "one factor that depends strongly on the mixing depth is the earliest point along the rgb where mixing - induced aluminum variations can occur . in figure 13",
    "we draw a dashed vertical line at [ al / fe ]  =  @xmath219 to indicate where the aluminum enhancements cross the into the `` high '' aluminum distribution for m  13 giants .",
    "our results show that for the mixing depths shown in figure 13 , large aluminum enhancements should appear along the brightest @xmath21  1.5 to 0.5 magnitudes of the rgb .",
    "a change in @xmath223 from 0.05 to 0.20 results in a one magnitude difference in where the aluminum abundance rises on the rgb .",
    "we apply these estimates to the m  13 sample by binning the data according to the magnitudes at which the various mixing depths predict the aluminum abundances will cross the [ al / fe ]  =  @xmath219 threshold .",
    "the results are shown in table 8 , where the first two columns describe the models and the next five discuss the data .",
    "the first column gives the mixing depth and the second column describes how far down the rgb the models predict a star will cross into the `` high '' aluminum group for that mixing depth , while the third column gives the fraction of stars in the bin ( out of 96 ) .",
    "the fourth and fifth columns give the @xmath186-value and the al ratio for stars in the bin , respectively , while final two columns give the @xmath186-value and the al ratio for the remaining stars outside the bin .. -values for the sake of completeness . ]",
    "if the assumption that mixing is the cause of the aluminum enhancements in the bright giants of m  13 holds , then it is apparent from table 8 that it must turn on somewhere during the brightest magnitude of the rgb , as the al ratio changes from 67:33 to 88:12 as one approaches the rgb tip .",
    "this signifies that at least 21% of the giants are experiencing deep mixing .",
    "we call this a lower limit because our technique for measuring aluminum enhancements can not detect mixing in stars with initially high [ al / fe ] values .",
    "since two - thirds of the giants in m  13 appear to have high aluminum abundances before mixing takes effect , we could be missing a substantial number of stars undergoing deep mixing . if the same relative number of giants with initially high aluminum abundances undergo deep mixing as the relative number of giants with initially low aluminum abundances , the percentage of all stars undergoing deep mixing jumps to 63% .",

    "for example , @xcite noticed a relationship between the hb morphology and the amount of depletion of oxygen in rgb stars .",
    "this does not necessarily imply that oxygen is a second parameter , but rather that whatever is responsible for the oxygen depletions might also be causing the blueward shift in the hb .",
    "one such mechanism that can do both is rotation , which has several effects : 1 ) it can extend the life of a red giant , causing it to lose more mass and ultimately end up on the blue hb , 2 ) it can drive meridional circulation currents , which can deplete the oxygen , and 3 ) if fast enough , it can cause the circulation currents to penetrate the h  shell and bring helium to the surface .",
    "this extra helium causes rgb stars to evolve to the blue hb at brighter luminosities than their unmixed counterparts , mimicking the second - parameter effect and reproducing the upward slope of the hb with decreasing color @xcite that is observed in some metal - rich clusters @xcite .    in this section",
    ", we examine the suggestion by @xcite that a so - called `` blue - tail second parameter '' ( btp ) exists in m  13 .",
    "such a parameter differs from the more commonly sought after second parameter in the sense that the latter typically deals with difference in hb morphology on the flat part of the hb , whereas the former describes how clusters like m  13 , m  80 and ngc  6752 develop extended blue tails .",
    "we attempt to discover whether or not deep mixing can be a / the btp by adding extra helium into the atmosphere of rgb stars .",
    "unfortunately , helium can not be measured spectroscopically in cool giants ; however , as shown in figure 8 , aluminum is made from magnesium inside the h  shell where helium is being produced , so that the mixing of helium is accompanied by the mixing of aluminum ; i.e. , aluminum can be a good tracer of helium mixing .",
    "we conclude that if deep mixing is a btp and if aluminum traces helium mixing , then there should exist a correlation between the al ratio and the hb morphology . to describe the hb morphology quantitatively , we suggest using at the ratio of blue to red hb stars ( hereafter , the `` hb ratio '' ) , which , of course , require definitions of their own .",
    "perhaps a solution can be found in the corollary assumption that if cluster giants do not mix , then the cluster should not have an extended blue tail on the hb .",
    "therefore , by assumption , a cluster like m  3 , whose giants appear not to experience deep mixing , defines the `` red '' hb , so that for clusters like m  13 , any star on the hb that is hotter than the m  3 hb is defined as `` blue , '' provided , of course , that the clusters are similar in all other ways ( e.g. , metallicity , age , environment , etc . ) .    to make the comparison between m  3 and m  13 , we obtained high - quality hubble space telescope photometric data for both clusters from dr .",
    "f. ferraro and shifted the m  3 hb by @xmath235 and @xmath236 to align it with that of m  13 , as done by @xcite .",
    "we then plotted histograms of the distributions of colors along the hb s for each cluster , as shown in figure 14 , and compared the hb ratio in m  13 with its al ratio .",
    "we define stars with @xmath237 as being blue , which gives a hb ratio of 58:42 .",
    "we note that while this choice of color coincides with the apparent gap in figure 14 , it is chosen because this is where the m  3 distribution drops off and not because of the appearance of bimodality in the m  13 distribution . to estimate an error in the hb ratio , we fit a gaussian to the m  3 distribution to determine the standard deviation , @xmath100 , and call blue all m  13 stars hotter than the mean minus @xmath238 in m  3 , resulting in an hb ratio of 74:26 .",
    "compared with the 21% to 63% deeply mixed stars on the rgb , the 58% to 74% blue hb stars is consistent with deep mixing as the btp ; although , the uncertainties in the number of rgb stars that have undergone deep mixing makes the results less robust than desired .    it would be helpful if we could discriminate between stars that have undergone deep mixing and those that have been polluted .",
    "one way to do this might be by using the @xmath1-process abundances , which are also created in intermediate - mass agb stars ( ims ) with aluminum , albeit at different locations within the stars @xcite .",
    "stars above @xmath239 experience hbb , which , as discussed above , result in the production of @xmath176al from magnesium .",
    "these same stars also create a neutron exposure during the thermal pulses in the he - burning shell that favors the production of the sr - y - zr peak elements and @xmath177 mg , all through the @xmath0ne@xmath240 mg reaction @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath241-rich material is mixed with the hbb by - products and ejected into the cluster medium , then one should trace the other in the polluted stars . specifically",
    ", we expect stars with high @xmath1-process abundances to also have high [ al / fe ] values , but not vice - versa .",
    "the key is to choose the best @xmath1-process elements that trace the al - rich ims ejecta .",
    "we suggest using zirconium since many lines are available in the optical spectrum and it s abundance easily computed @xcite .",
    "conversely , elements near the barium peak would not be good choices to represent the @xmath1-process / hbb enhancement from ims since they are produced in low - mass agb stars ( @xmath242 ) .",
    "recently , @xcite pointed out that mixing into the h  shell to enrich the stellar atmosphere in aluminum and helium would result in an overproduction of sodium by @xmath243 dex ( see their figure 3 ) relative to the m  13 data , essentially precluding deep mixing .",
    "this constraint keeps the change in the atmospheric helium abundance to less than 0.06 , much less than the 0.20 found by @xcite that is needed to account for the most extended hb s seen in clusters like m  13 .",
    "we submit that the solution to this discrepancy might be found in the initial abundances ; i.e. , primordial contamination from the ims plays a role .",
    "our algorithm shows that the overproduction of sodium is avoided , even with deep mixing , if the initial @xmath0ne abundance were depleted as a result of @xmath0ne@xmath240 mg reaction in the ims , which also enhances the initial @xmath177 mg , as needed to produce the large aluminum enhancements in the rgb stars .",
    "the calculations of @xcite indicate that the @xmath0ne abundance is depleted by approximately 30% during the thermal pulses in ims , but it is not clear how hbb and interpulse burning affects the net @xmath0ne abundance .",
    "one would assume that hbb would deplete the @xmath0ne reserves in the convective envelope and produce @xmath244na as is done on the rgb .",
    "in contradistinction , the agb yields calculated by @xcite actually enhance the net @xmath0ne abundance from a series of @xmath42 captures on @xmath222n .",
    "clearly , a more complete and detailed look into the yields of all abundances from primordial agb stars is necessary to determine a more translucent picture of how pollution plays a role on the rgb .",
    "our hypothesis is consistent with the sodium data , which raise two important questions : 1 ) why does the na ratio increase only at the same magnitudes as the al ratio when sodium is very easily produced from @xmath0ne above the h  shell at luminosities far below the rgb tip , and 2 ) why does the sodium abundance vary without oxygen abundance variations for `` oxygen - normal '' giants ( see , e.g. , kslp ) .",
    "the answer to both these questions might be found on the agb : if @xmath0ne is depleted to build up @xmath177 mg during the he - shell flashes and @xmath244na during hbb , then sodium will not be produced at lower magnitudes on the rgb , but will be made at brighter magnitudes from @xmath175ne with deep mixing . the extra sodium produced during hbb",
    "could be distributed locally within the cluster creating the [ na / fe]-rich stars that are independent of their oxygen abundances .",
    "although oxygen is likely depleted during hbb , this is unlikely to create an oxygen - poor rgb atmosphere since it is easier to enhance elements in an atmosphere than to deplete them by pollution .",
    "a primordial pollution scenario is consistent with the data that show aluminum and sodium enhancements on the lower rgb and , for some clusters , on the main sequence and subgiant branch , and can help prevent the overproduction of sodium during deep mixing .",
    "before we discuss our final conclusions , we first remind the reader of the number of assumptions that have gone into our analysis . first , there are errors associated with the abundance determinations that we tried to characterize by allowing for significant variations in the model atmosphere parameters , which contribute the most to the uncertainty in the analysis .",
    "second , the inclusion of the wiyn data into our analysis comes at a price : the data have poor signal - to - noise ratios , come from only one line and require the assumption that , for some stars with indeterminate line strengths , the [ al / fe ] value is `` low . ''",
    "third , despite that fact that this is the largest compilation of [ al / fe ] and [ na / fe ] values in one globular cluster to be analyzed in a single paper , the data are still subject to small number effects , particularly at the rgb tip . unfortunately , there are only so many tip stars that can be spectroscopically measured from the ground , leaving this problem difficult to solve .",
    "we suggest the best way to handle the small numbers is to expand this analysis to other clusters for a broad comparative study .",
    "fourth , the models have many assumptions in them : we assume that canonical evolution holds and add in our mixing algorithm after the fact , we assume that mixing is instantaneous , we assume that the abundances are distributed as per @xcite , we assume that our reaction rates are accurate , and we assume that we adequately searched the parameter space allowed by the uncertainties in the initial abundances , nuclear reaction rates and mass - loss rates .",
    "fifth , we assume that no other second parameter affects the relationship between the m  3 and m  13 hb morphologies .",
    "sixth , we make no attempt to correct for blending of the agb with the rgb when performing our analysis .",
    "approximately 20% of the red giants above the point where giant branches merge are supposedly agb interlopers based on comparative lifetimes : the problem is to determine which ones are really agb stars .",
    "this might not be as much of a problem for the m  13 sample , however , since blue hb stars tend to evolve away from the agb .",
    "the best workaround for this problem is also an extension of our analysis to other clusters to look for consistent trends despite this , and the other , uncertainties .",
    "the importance of having accurate nuclear reaction rates can not be overstated .",
    "this is particularly true when using aluminum as a diagnostic of deep mixing . if we were to vary , for example , the @xmath178 mg proton - capture rate to its upper limit in range of @xmath245 , the production of al can move outside the h shell , although ,",
    "just barely .",
    "depending on the initial abundances of @xmath177 mg and @xmath178 mg , this might be able to account for the full enhancements of aluminum that we observed .",
    "in addition , according to the nacre compilation , the rate for @xmath178al@xmath246si is uncertain by as much as three orders of magnitude in the same temperature range .",
    "increasing these rates might help solve the problem presented by @xcite who show that , if mixing occurs below the top of the h shell , sodium is overproduced due to the extra enhancement from @xmath175ne in the nena cycle , a result we confirm with our instantaneous mixing algorithm . if the @xmath178 mg proton - capture rate is near its upper limit , then deep mixing is not required to produce the observed aluminum abundances and sodium is not over enhanced compared to the observations .",
    "our general results for the m  3 and m  13 abundances obtained in this work show the usual trends in the proton - capture , @xmath42 and iron - peak elements : the sodium and aluminum abundances are anticorrelated with oxygen , the @xmath42 elements are enhanced by approximately 0.3 dex and the iron - peak elements remain constant .",
    "our analysis shows that the variation in both the [ al / fe ] and [ na / fe ] ratios are consistent with deep mixing occurring on the rgb in m  13 and not in m  3 . the aluminum and sodium data are correlated for the m  13 giants ; although , the al ratio is probably a better indicator of deep mixing since it is more easily separated into `` high '' and `` low '' groups .",
    "we would not expect such a similar tight correlation between aluminum and sodium in the m  3 giants since sodium can be enhanced without increasing the aluminum abundance if the mixing currents do not penetrate the h shell , as seems indicated in m  3 from the low al ratio .",
    "however , some semblance of a correlation between aluminum and sodium might be set up by primordial effects in this cluster .",
    "in addition , the na ratio increases near the same magnitude as the al ratio , which is contrary to the previous predictions that sodium should be enhanced further down the rgb from @xmath0ne ( csb98 ) .",
    "our models show that this would be expected if the @xmath0ne were depleted in primordial intermediate - mass agb stars .",
    "when comparing the al ratio with the hb ratio , it seems that the assumption of deep mixing as a blue - tail parameter is self - consistent ; however , the large range allowed in the actual number of mixed rgb stars and the empirical definitions of `` blue '' and `` red '' hb stars do not constrain the results enough to be firmly conclusive .",
    "again we suggest that a similar analysis as the one presented here be extended to other clusters to determine the al ratio as a function of @xmath4 and to compare this with the hb ratio .",
    "if the al ratio at the rgb tip can be shown to be a predictor of the hb ratio , then helium mixing would certainly be given greater credence as a blue - tail second parameter , supplanting the oft - assumed cluster age differences that have been shown to fail for this classical pair of clusters .",
    "in particular , we suggest the study of metal - rich clusters to see if the aluminum distribution is bimodal , and if it is , if the al ratio varies . according to our models ,",
    "it should not vary since aluminum can not be produced in metal - rich cluster giants on the same scale as it can in the intermediate metallicity and metal - poor giants .",
    "in addition , we suggest further examination of the sodium abundance in clusters to search for similar behavior as in m  13 . also , we suggest a more extensive comparison of the @xmath1-process abundances with the aluminum data as a test of primordial contamination .",
    "finally , we conclude that the problem of abundance anomalies in globular cluster red giants requires detailed study of the abundance yields from primordial agb stars as well as an in - depth and complete study of the hydrodynamical evolution of rotating rgb stars . in the meantime , aluminum , and to a lesser extent , sodium , give the best diagnostics of deep mixing during the evolution up the rgb and the @xmath1-process elements near the sr - y - zr peak are the best tracers of agb pollution from ims .    the authors expressly acknowledge and thank caty pilachowski for allowing us to use her data and for her valuable help in analyzing them .",

    "this derivation of instantaneous mixing begins with the form of the nuclear reaction equation that involves the proton - capture reactions and @xmath247-decays ; although , it is easily extended to other rates and is applied in its most general form in our code : @xmath248 where @xmath249 is the number of nuclei of type @xmath250 @xmath251 that are being produced or destroyed , @xmath252 is the number @xmath251 of nuclei that produce ( @xmath154 sign ) or , when @xmath253 , destroy ( @xmath6 sign ) nuclei of type @xmath254 , @xmath255 is the number @xmath251 of protons , @xmath256 is the velocity - averaged cross section of the proton - capture reaction and @xmath257 is the mean lifetime of radioactive isotopes that destroy or produce element @xmath250 .",

    "mass loss can be accounted for my modifying the total integrated mass by some mass - loss recipe such as given by @xcite .",

    "<S> the spectra include lines of o , na , mg , al , si , ca , ti , v , mn , fe and ni . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyze the [ al / fe ] values of 96 rgb stars in m  13 covering the brightest 3.5 magnitudes , which include 66 measurements that were derived from moderate resolution , low signal - to - noise spectra obtained with the wiyn 3.5-meter telescope and hydra multi - object spectrograph , also on kitt peak . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we compile from the literature and inspect the [ na / fe ] values of 119 rgb stars in m  13 . </S>",
    "<S> we test for bimodality in the [ al / fe ] and [ na / fe ] distributions using the kmm algorithm and find that the [ al / fe ] values in m  13 are distributed bimodally at all points along the rgb that were observed , while the [ na / fe ] values are bimodal only over the brightest two magnitudes . </S>",
    "<S> the ratios of al - enhanced to al - normal and na - enhanced to na - normal giants increase towards the tip of the rgb in m  13 , which is suggestive of deep mixing in this cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the limited m  3 data exhibit a bimodal distribution of [ al / fe ] values and are suggestive of no deep mixing ; however , they are too few to be conclusive . </S>",
    "<S> we further test for a relationship between deep mixing on the rgb and a second parameter that can create the extended blue tail seen along the horizontal - branches of some clusters by using an `` instantaneous '' mixing algorithm , which we develop here . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the data for both clusters are consistent with deep mixing as a `` blue - tail second parameter '' , and we suggest future observations to further constrain the results . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we offer a solution to the problem of over producing sodium during deep mixing that is based on the depletion of @xmath0ne in asymptotic - giant - branch stars and suggest that pollution might best be traced by @xmath1-process elements in the sr - y - zr peak . </S>"
