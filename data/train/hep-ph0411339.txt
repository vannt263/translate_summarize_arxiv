    "a consistent description of interaction of fundamental fields both at large and short distances is one of the most important problems of qcd .",
    "the strength of the interaction is defined by invariant charge @xmath0 ( the running coupling constant ) , which satisfies the renormalization group equation .",
    "the purpose of the present work consists in a formulation of a model for @xmath0 for all @xmath17 , which is appropriate for description both of perturbative and of nonperturbative phenomena and needs minimal number of parameters .",
    "we assume that there exists some value @xmath18 , which characterizes the nonperturbative effects scale and the corresponding value @xmath8 @xmath19 such , that for @xmath20 and thus @xmath21 the finite loop perturbation theory is applicable and sufficient , while nonperturbative effects prevails in region @xmath22 , which contains also nonphysical singularities of the perturbation theory and so here this theory essentially needs an extension of definition . in general , the invariant charge and the beta - function as well",
    "are depending on a renormalization scheme  @xcite . for definiteness while performing calculations at @xmath23 we use @xmath24 scheme .",
    "it is well - known , that the @xmath3-function in the perturbative qcd is of the form @xmath25 for @xmath26 3 we have values of coefficients @xmath27 9 , @xmath28 32 , @xmath29 1287.67 , @xmath30 12090.38 ( coefficients @xmath31 , @xmath32 do not depend on renormalization scheme while values @xmath33 , @xmath34 correspond to a choice of @xmath24-scheme ) .",
    "expressions obtained by solution of gell - mann  low equation @xmath35 with the use of  ( [ 1 ] ) , are widely used for sufficiently large momenta transfer , however they can not be applied in the infrared region .    as a matter of fact",
    "the behavior of @xmath4 at small momenta till now is an open question .",
    "lattice methods and sd equations give no an ultimate answer .",
    "for behavior of the invariant charge @xmath0 at @xmath36 a number of variants are considered ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "now the most popular variants for @xmath37 behavior are : @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath4 is strongly enhanced .",
    "we consider the last possibility , in particular the well - known singular infrared asymptotic behavior @xmath40 for a review see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and more recent papers refs .",
    ". such behavior of the invariant charge @xmath41 in so - called v - scheme corresponds to a linear confining quark - antiquark static potential at that @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the string tension .",
    "results of some works  @xcite on the lattice study of the three - gluon vertex demonstrate a necessity of taking into account of nonperturbative contributions to the running coupling constant being of the form  ( [ 3 ] ) . in the framework of the continuous qft additional arguments in favor of behavior  ( [ 3 ] )",
    "are also presented in paper  @xcite .",
    "highly similar singular infrared behavior has recently developed model for the qcd analytic invariant charge  @xcite .",
    "asymptotic behavior  ( [ 3 ] ) occurs provided @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "we consider a possibility of behavior  ( [ 3 ] ) and assume the following form of the infrared @xmath3-function @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a constant and @xmath48 corresponds to the boundary between perturbative and nonperturbative regions .",
    "for @xmath49 we shall use @xmath3-function  ( [ 1 ] ) with a finite number of loops taken into account .",
    "our recipe for construction of @xmath3-function for all @xmath50 consists in a smooth matching of expressions  ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 1 ] ) at point @xmath51 in approximations of the perturbation theory up to four loops .",
    "the demand of the @xmath3-function and its derivative to be continuous uniquely fix free parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 of the global @xmath3-function ( the matched one ) .",
    "note , that the presence of parameter @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) which corresponds to coulomb contribution in invariant charge gives a possibility of smooth matching .",
    "we are willing to build the model for the invariant charge , which precisely coincides the perturbation theory in the perturbative region @xmath52 , while in the nonperturbative infrared region it provides simple description of main nonperturbative parameters .",
    "the work is organized in the following way . in section 2",
    "we obtain the matched solutions for the cases of 1  4 loops .",
    "dimensionless parameters of the model are uniquely defined and further the solutions are normalized at the scale of the @xmath53-lepton mass , that leads to definite values of dimensional parameters @xmath54 , @xmath18 , @xmath43 . in section 3",
    "the gluon condensate is calculated .",
    "in doing this we consider first a possibility of freezing of the perturbative component of @xmath4 in the infrared region and secondly a possibility of analytic behaviour of this component in the infrared region .",
    "section 4 contains concluding remarks .",
    "for an illustration let us consider the most simple one - loop case .",
    "conditions of matching give two equations @xmath56 @xmath57 the solution of set  ( [ 5 ] ) reads @xmath58 we shall normalize perturbative solution @xmath59 by value @xmath60 , that gives @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "imposing on @xmath0 the natural condition to be continuous at @xmath63 , we may normalize nonperturbative solution of equation  ( [ 2 ] ) @xmath64 by @xmath60 as well . as a result",
    "we obtain @xmath65 equations  ( [ 10 ] ) are correct for one  four loops , for one - loop case @xmath66 . for final fixation of the solution for all @xmath5 we need to define @xmath6 by normalizing the solution , say , at point @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the mass of the @xmath53-lepton .",
