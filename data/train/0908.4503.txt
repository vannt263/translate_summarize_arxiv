    "gamma - radiation emitted by electrons and positrons at their non - channeled passage through planarly oriented bent crystals has been investigated in a few recent experiments @xcite searching for signatures of the charged particle volume reflection effect @xcite in the radiation spectrum . however , the spectra observed were largely monotonous at typical photon frequencies @xmath2 , and the difference between the measured spectra from positrons and electrons was basically of order of the experimental errors . at first sight , that may appear surprising , since the inherent dynamics and the final reflection angle of volume reflection itself are known to be sufficiently different in cases of positively and negatively charged particles . in article @xcite dedicated to computer simulation of the conditions of experiment @xcite it was mentioned that the radiation spectrum must contain a component of so - called coherent bremsstrahlung in a bent crystal ( cbbc ) ( see @xcite , appendix ) , arising at fast charged particle highly over - barrier motion , when perturbative treatment of particle interaction with the crystal is valid . actually , radiation of that type may prove even dominant when the active crystallographic plane bending angle is many times larger than the critical value @xmath3 and 6 @xmath3 , which is rather large . ]  then the particle must spend most of its time traveling at angles to atomic planes much larger than critical , i. e. , flying high above the potential barrier .",
    "thereat , the frequency of the radiation emitted by the particle at a given instant is proportional to the local frequency of atomic plane crossing by the particle , as in ordinary coherent bremsstrahlung @xcite . in course of the particle passage ,",
    "the angle of atomic plane crossing varies , and the coherent radiation intensity accordingly sweeps over the spectrum .",
    "close to the volume reflection point , of course , the particle motion will become non - perturbative , but the radiation from that region contributes relatively little to the spectrum as a whole , in contrast to the situation with the elastic scattering , where it is only the volume reflection point vicinity that contributes to the particle final deflection angle .",
    "the origin of the difference between the cases is obvious : the magnitude of the intra - crystalline transverse force is about the same all over the crystal , so all traversed crystal regions contribute commensurably to the total irradiation energy . as for the particle deflection angle , it is sensitive to the force _ sign _ , and thus receives little contribution from the regions where the force oscillates rapidly , as it does at large angles of atomic plane crossing .    in view of the described situation , prior to studies of radiation features stemming from non - perturbative segments of particle motion in bent crystals , it seems expedient to determine the shape of perturbative cbbc spectrum , which yields a wide continuous background and at the same time provides the conceptually simplest approximation .",
    "unfortunately , so far it has not been evaluated in a form suitable for comparison with experiment .",
    "it is the purpose of this article to present a full , though basic calculation , and also to determine characteristic scales for the physics of the process .",
    "last not least , we will assess robustness of the simplest cbbc theory against various deteriorating effects present in nature , such as multiple scattering and the dipole regime failure .",
    "it turns out that the range of the dipole cbbc theory is rather limited , although non - vanishing .    in view of the universality of the cbbc radiation in bent crystals of various shapes ( existing examples include cylindrically bent crystals , sine - shaped bent crystals @xcite , other microfabricated configurations may appear in future ) , we extend our treatment to the case of arbitrary crystal bend profile .",
    "our ability to cope with it grounds on the applicability of stationary phase approximation allowing one to treat the crystal curvature as locally constant .",
    "that variant of the stationary phase approximation is of different origin than the one arising in problems of synchrotron - like radiation , and does not contradict to the use of the dipole approximation in radiation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pot - cart ] we define the bent crystal planar continuous potential and the corresponding transverse force . in sec .",
    "[ sec : defl ] we proceed to evaluating the particle deflection angle by such a force to the leading order of high - energy perturbation theory of classical mechanics . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rad ] we evaluate the radiation spectrum in the dipole approximation , including the quantum effect of radiation recoil ( allowing for photon energies to be of order of the initial electron s ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conditions ] the conditions of applicability of such an approximation are analyzed .",
    "[ sec : summary ] provides a summary .",
    "at practice , for the coherent bremsstrahlung at over - barrier particle passage not to be spoiled by the particle multiple scattering on the target nuclei it is desirable to work with a crystal not thicker than a few millimeters ( the same situation as for coherent bremsstrahlung in straight crystals ) .",
    "there are various techniques for manufacturing such crystals with bent atomic planes along the short direction , but basically they fall into two categories . first ",
    "one of the crystal transverse dimensions is made short , and even shorter than longitudinal ( i. e. , @xmath4 mm ) , which permits to bend the crystal along the longitudinal direction @xcite .",
    "second  both transverse dimensions are made sufficiently sizeable and the crystal so obtained is bent by some of the large dimensions , but securing that ( short ) crystallographic planes in the crystal , along which the beam is to be sent , acquire some bending , too .",
    "specifically , the bending of the latter may be achieved through the action of anti - clastic forces , when the crystal is deformed simultaneously by _ both _ large transverse dimensions with different strength @xcite , or one might just arrange the active planes to be under some angle @xmath5 to the large face , and then they must bend along with the large face , although @xmath6 times weaker . at the same time , for issues of particle passage through the crystal the deviations of the large crystal faces from planes may be neglected .",
    "schematic of an ultra - high - energy particle passage through a thin bent crystal .",
    "the vicinity of point @xmath7 of the trajectory tangency to crystal bent planes gives the main contribution to the particle deflection angle . ]    in any case , for what concerns description of the particle passage , the geometry implies particle incidence at some ( small ) angle @xmath8 to @xmath9-axis , chosen normal to the crystal large faces ( let the latter be located at positions @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) , and the particle essentially interacts with the continuous potential of the planes depending only on single coordinate @xmath12 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : angle ] ) .",
    "the distance between the bent planes is practically unaffected by the crystal curvature , and the equation defining each plane takes the form @xmath13 constants @xmath14 being equal - spaced with the inter - planar distance @xmath15 .    then ,",
    "if the continuous inter - planar potential in the bent crystal was @xmath16 ( a periodic function with period @xmath15 ) , which corresponds to an acting force @xmath17 , after bending of this crystal the force will modify to @xmath18 ( still , it can be regarded as directed along @xmath12 ) . for crystals of constant curvature , may be even more accurate than that of a circular arc .",
    "the author acknowledges communication with v.   guidi on this point . ]",
    "@xmath19 with @xmath20 being the atomic plane bending radius . in",
    "what follows , we will rely on the stationary phase approximation , in which the crystal curvature is treated locally , and is described by the local bending radius @xmath21 to emerge naturally in the following .",
    "the dynamics of a high - energy particle in a crystal may be described by ultra - relativistic classical mechanics @xcite .",
    "as we have agreed , we will use perturbative description of particle interaction with the crystal ; this is a rather common approach in the theory of coherent bremsstrahlung .",
    "conditions thereof will be specified later ( sec .  [ sec : conditions ] ) .    in the perturbative treatment of classical particle passage dynamics , as well as in quantum theory",
    ", it is advantageous to express the periodic continuous potential in a form of fourier series .",
    "such a representation is economic ( provided only a few lowest harmonics dominate ) , and at the same time convenient when proceeding from description of a straight crystal to a bent one .",
    "for evaluation of the particle trajectory and the emitted radiation , of direct relevance is not the potential but the force acting on the particle . to define the force  firstly , in a straight crystal  it is convenient to choose the origin of @xmath12-axis in the middle of some inter - plane interval , with respect to which the potential is an even function of @xmath12 , whereby the force has to be odd",
    ". then , fourier decomposition of the force involves sine functions only : @xmath22 ( the numerical factors have been introduced for further convenience ) .    in the simplest but important case of ( 110 )",
    "planar orientation of a crystal with diamond - type lattice ( e. g. , silicon ) , the inter - planar continuous potential is approximable by a parabola , and the corresponding force  by a linear - sawtooth function , whose fourier decomposition reads    @xmath23    according to ( [ fsawtooth - spat ] ) , @xmath24 has the meaning of the force extremal value achieved at @xmath25 , the sign of @xmath24 being equal to that of the particle charge . on the contrary , in another important case of orientation ( 111 ) , there are two different ( but also nearly parabolic ) wells within the period of the continuous potential @xcite , and the force fourier decomposition turns somewhat more complicated : @xmath26 ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 have meaning of depths of the alternate unequal potential wells , while the well widths are exactly @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) .",
    "anyway , once one factors out here the value of the first fourier coefficient , @xmath31 eq .",
    "( [ f111 ] ) will assume the form similar to ( [ fsawtooth ] ) : @xmath32 here @xmath33 is a sequence of coefficients of order unity , neither increasing nor decreasing as @xmath34 , and by definition @xmath35 . ,",
    "@xmath36 , one obtains @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 . ]    to take into account thermal smearing of the potential , i. e. , the force continuity at the locations of atomic planes , the simplest though heuristic trick is to increase the power of @xmath41 in the overall @xmath42 factor of the trigonometric series : @xmath43 at that , the sequence @xmath33 ( or its parameters @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) may need to be corrected , but still the series is dominated by the first term , for which @xmath44 .",
    "such a modification acts similarly to the conventional debye - waller exponential factor ( which , in principle , is also heuristic , only its first order maclaurin term being rigorously related to thermal averages ) .",
    "we refrain here from discussing the exact relation of @xmath45 with temperature @xmath46 , only indicate that for the case of si ( 110 ) at room temperature agreement with the potentials used in the literature is achieved at @xmath47 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sawtooth ] ) , whereas for si ( 111 ) it takes @xmath48 . to supply more motivation to our ansatz ,",
    "note that in what follows the summation of series of the type ( [ ftherm ] ) with constant @xmath45 and simple @xmath33 will yield riemann @xmath49-related functions .",
    "such functions emerge as well for a zero - temperature potential ( @xmath50 ) , only in the latter case the function arguments being integer or half - integer .",
    "our approach corresponds to extension of those arguments to arbitrary fractional values , i. e. to an  analytic continuation \" , in order to model the effect of the temperature in a simplest way .",
    "none of the following numerical results ( serving as estimates ) depends crucially on this technique .",

    "practical bent crystals are usually manufactured from silicon .",
    "the relevant physical parameters for silicon are    [ fd ] @xmath52    note that product @xmath53 for those cases has practically identical values , which is important for the subsequent numerical estimates .",
    "but all our figures will be drawn only for a simpler case ( 110 ) .",
    "in this section we shall analyze the elastic scattering of ultra - high energy particles by the continuous force defined in the previous section . choose the time reference point at the moment of the particle passage through the middle of the crystal ( @xmath54 ) , so that we may equate @xmath55 ( we will use units @xmath56 ) .",
    "since the beam width in practice is always greater than the inter - planar distance , there is essentially a uniform distribution of particles in transverse impact parameters . defining impact parameter @xmath57 of an individual particle as the trajectory initial asymptote",
    "intercept on @xmath12-axis , i. e. at @xmath54 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : angle ] ) , the force acting on the particle in a bent crystal can be written as @xmath58 with @xmath59  the heavyside unit step function ( zero for negative arguments and unity for positive ones ) .",
    "first of all , let us evaluate the particle deflection angle .",
    "asymptotically , to leading order in the potential to energy ratio @xmath60 , the deflection angle is proportional to the integral of force ( [ force - f - l ] ) along the particle unperturbed straight path : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the tsyganov critical radius @xcite ( the above definition of @xmath63 yet allows it , along with @xmath24 , to have different sign depending on the particle charge sign ) . if the crystal bending is macroscopic , in the sense that displacement @xmath64 of the planes is ( generally ) @xmath65 , the integrand is rapidly oscillatory . for evaluation of such",
    "an integral , one may employ the stationary phase approximation @xcite .",
    "this requires , in the first place , finding stationary phase points @xmath66 at which @xmath67 i. e. , the points of tangency of a ray with slope @xmath8 to the family of bent crystalline planes . for a convex function @xmath64",
    "such a point is unique  and for simplicity we will assume this to be the case , dubbing it @xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : angle ] ) .",
    "then , expanding function @xmath68 in taylor series about @xmath7 up to quadratic terms , one brings ( [ th1 ] ) to the form @xmath69     geometric interpretation of the coherence length of a fast particle traversing a bent crystal : @xmath70 is a half - chord within a curved crystalline plane ( radius @xmath71 ) tangential to the next curved plane at distance @xmath15 from the initial one . ]    now , if point @xmath7 belongs to the interval @xmath72 , the integral converges in a small vicinity of this point of the width @xmath73 where @xmath74 ( for a geometric construction see fig .",
    "[ fig : l - efc ] ) .",
    "physically , this is the length on which the deflecting external field acts periodically , and will be referred to as the external field coherence ( efc ) length .",
    "then , the integration limits in ( [ stat - phase ] ) may as well be extended to infinity , and the integral evaluates by a standard formula @xmath75 with @xmath76 function defined as @xmath77 if @xmath78 .",
    "if , on the contrary , @xmath7 falls beyond the integration interval , the integrand is everywhere rapidly oscillatory , and the result is small ( yet there are contributions from the end - points , inferior to those from stationary phase points , but they will be neglected throughout for simplicity ) . with this accuracy , @xmath79\\bigg).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , the magnitude of deflection angles is determined by the crystalline plane curvature radius in the point of the trajectory tangency to the bent planes .    as for functions",
    "@xmath80 , @xmath81 appearing in ( [ theta ] ) , they may be obtained explicitly only if @xmath68 is a sufficiently simple analytic function .",
    "for instance , in case of a crystal of constant curvature ( [ uniform ] ) they express through the only available parameter  the plane bending radius : @xmath82 so , at practice reversible analytic parameterizations of the bending profile @xmath68 are favored .",
    "for the case of orientation ( 110 ) , when @xmath83 , the sum in the right - hand side of ( [ theta ] ) can be expressed in terms of hurwitz ( generalized riemann ) @xmath49-functions : @xmath84 where @xmath85 characterizes the impact parameter of an oblique trajectory relative to the bent planes in point @xmath86 , and @xmath87 is the hurwitz zeta - function @xcite , while braces @xmath88 in its second argument indicate the entry fractional part ( ranging from 0 to 1 ) . for orientation ( 111 ) the result can be expressed through hurwitz zeta - functions in a similar manner , but it is somewhat more bulky and shall not be quoted herein .",

    "the average value of the deflection angle over the impact parameters is strictly zero , as an average of a sum of sine functions over their full period .",
    "the physical reason behind that is the uniform distribution of an unperturbed particle flow over the crystal , entailing equal influence of positive and negative forces on the entire beam .",
    "so , in the adopted first order of perturbation theory there is no signature of volume reflection of the beam .",
    "non - zero , however , is the angular spread acquired by the beam , whose measure is the deflection angle mean square : @xmath95 the latter quantity will also play part in the treatment of radiation .",
    "having established in the previous section the description of the particle passage through the crystal , we are in a position to calculate the accompanying radiation . as is typical for bremsstrahlung from relativistic particles ,",
    "the radiation is concentrated within a cone of angles @xmath96 about the forward direction , and those small angles may be treated inclusively .",

    "thus , unfortunately , it is impossible to demand inequality ( [ sqrtggg ] ) as really strong .",
    "anyway , the optimal value for the active crystallographic plane bending angle is about @xmath262 then , the parameter of radiation non - dipoleness ( also known as @xmath263-parameter @xcite ) is @xmath264 whereas the parameter of radiation decoherence due to multiple scattering is about the same : @xmath265    in view of the narrowness of condition ( [ sqrtggg ] ) , it seems reasonable to suggest that since the size of the coherence length remains the same for all locations within a uniformly bent crystal , and the length @xmath258 is constant as well , then even if condition ( [ lrll ] ) fails ( multiple scattering effects are substantial ) , the spectrum _ shape _ may still be roughly described by the present theory , only the intensity being suppressed by a factor depending on the ratio @xmath266 .",

    "the most demanding condition seems to be the initial electron beam collimation degree @xmath281 .",
    "if not achieved , an averaging of the radiation spectrum over the electron beam incidence angles must be performed .",
    "the present study substantiates the notion that spectral intensity of radiation from ultra - high - energy electrons and positrons in a bent crystal is a sum of contributions from particle motion intervals on which the local angle between the particle velocity and the bent crystalline planes is definite , and so each such contribution is similar to coherent bremsstrahlung in a straight crystal .",

    "we have also qualitatively discussed the modification of the coherent radiation spectrum in the domain of small @xmath2 owing to the onset of the volume reflection phenomenon possible when @xmath286 ) there appears to be a maximum in the spectrum , but it is not to be interpreted as a resonance .",
    "the theoretical description adopted in this article had resorted to many simplifications ",
    "it did not properly incorporate the temperature dependence of the potential , neglected multiple scattering , and relied on an infinitesimal approximation to the particle deflection ( in the bulk of the medium ) as well as on dipole description of the radiation .",
    "conditions ( [ rdlll ] , [ optimal]-[egg ] ) under which those approximations hold , altogether appear to be restrictive for the crystal bending angle ( see eq .",
    "( [ optimal ] ) ) , so generalization to a non - dipole treatment , and an account of the multiple scattering would be highly desirable .",

    "comparison of the cbbc theory with the available experimental data is intended elsewhere .    in conclusion ,",
    "let us remark that although our paper presumed dependence of the crystal deformation only on one , longitudinal , coordinate , in principle higher - dimensional deformation cases are conceivable , emerging under application of torsion , or owing to intrinsic crystal mosaicity . in those cases",
