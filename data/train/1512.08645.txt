    "the problem of root clustering - study of the sets of polynomials or matrices with fixed distribution of roots ( eigenvalues ) relative to some region @xmath0 is one of the classical problems in control theory .",
    "namely , asymptotic stability for linear continuous - time systems introduced in 1868 by j.c .",
    "maxwell in the very first paper on control theory @xcite led to the study of the distribution of roots relative to the hurwitz stability region ",
    "open left half - plane @xmath2 asymptotic stability for the linear discrete - time systems have led to the distributions of roots relative to the open unit disk(schur stability ) @xmath3 @xcite , real - rootedness ( hyperbolicity ) property of a polynomial , localisation of roots relative to some finite number of points , are among the most classical situations .",
    "general root clustering problems in control have been systematically studied since the appearance of a seminal paper by r.e kalman @xcite from 1969 .",
    "that moment could be seen as a start of development of _ root clustering theory _ as a special topic in control .",
    "since then many different types of stability regions have been examined in many different contexts : sufficient condition for hurwitz and schur superstabilizability @xcite and other sectoral stability regions , aperiodicity ( in a form @xmath4 ) @xcite , unions of disjoint disks @xcite , plane curves @xcite , cassini ovals @xcite , @xmath5-regions(i.e .",

    "should be especially noted a general theory of root clustering that has been developed by e. jury and s. gutman since the beginning of 1980 s ( see @xcite for formulation of the foundations and book @xcite ) .",

    "gryazina , b.t .",
    "polyak @xcite in 2000 s and the author in 2010 s @xcite .",
    "that approach consists in study the decomposition of parameter space for a fixed affine polynomial family    @xmath8    into the regions with fixed number of hurwitz stable  located inside the hurwitz stability region . and",
    "hurwitz unstable roots  located outside of the closure of the stability region .",
    "this decomposition is called _",
    "@xmath1-decomposition_. a number of algorithms ( both analytic and algebraic - related to the quantifier elimination problems ) , complicated examples and topological complexity bounds have been obtained within the framework of that approach .",
    "another important geometric approach is universal parameter space theory , which development have been started since a. fam and j. meditch from 1978 @xcite . here",
    "topology and algebraic geometry of the space of hurwitz and schur stable polynomials ",
    "polynomials with all of their roots belonging to the root clustering region , for the case of indeterminate polynomial family has been considered .",
    "our line of research consists in unification and generalisation of all 3 approaches considered before .",

    "@xmath1-stratification_. @xmath1-stratification consists in the decomposition of parameter space into the region with fixed number of roots inside the @xmath10 on the border of @xmath0 and in the complement to the closure of @xmath0 for an arbitrary semialgebraic @xmath9    instead of concentrating on the study of different very special regions @xmath0 or very special families of polynomials or providing some purely algorithmic root clustering criteria , we are trying to figure out some limited number of natural geometric constructions lying behind that kind of problems and sometimes informally used in classical papers as a _ continuity argument_. that paper is a first part of a longer text , that will cover not not only topological properties of the sets in question , but also their singularity theory , convexity - like properties , metric properties and construction of stratified spaces parametrising stability problems .",
    "matrix problems are only slighlty mentioned there .",
    "main of these natural geometric construction is the symmetric product construction .",
    "namely , our idea consists in transferring simple planar semialgebraic geometry and topology of the stability region @xmath0 across the symmetric product functor , to the parameter space . through the means of this transfer we become able to compute the topology of the @xmath1-strata . in order to show the computability of all constructions we prefer to use a semialgebraic category .    that paper is devoted mainly to the topological study of problems in question , as well as to the development of basic formalism covering main properties and classical intuitions behind this set of problems .",
    "we prove ( theorem [ classicalpoly ] ) that the stratification of @xmath11 with respect to the @xmath0 transferred via symmetrization induces a @xmath1-stratification on the space of coefficients of an indeterminate polynomial .",
    "stratum of the @xmath1-stratification is a set of all polynomials with fixed number of stable , semi - stable and unstable roots .",

    "we use here the language of abstract semialgebraic sets - semialgebraic spaces .",
    "it is essential because of lemmata [ unmixing],[unmixingconnected ] where one need to consider a morphism from some semialgebraic subset of the product of complex projective spaces , which could nt be extended to the variety as a whole .",
    "this is the main instrument of transfer of the planar geometry of the root space into the complicated geometry of the space of coefficients , we mentioned before .",
    "it is important to state that we are able to capture not only the geometry of a fixed degree polynomial , but also a local geometry of _ degree change _ , capturing , therefore a classical intuition of births and deaths of roots at the infinity , which forms an important part of a classical intuition . that geometry is captured by the structure of _ filtered space _ on the space of indeterminate polynomials , which happens to agree with @xmath1-stratification .",
    "interaction between @xmath1-stratification and filtered structure is examined in proposition [ birthdeath1 ] and theorem [ adjdigstab ] .",
    "we also introduce an adjacency digraph functor allowing us to compute structure of adjacencies between @xmath1-strata in a natural way ( lemma [ funct ] , proposition [ spoweradj ] ) .",
    "moreover , our construction of the root - coeffient correspondence as a symmetric product of stratified variety allows to obtain a natural duality between spaces of monic and non - monic polynomial , which happens to be also a duality between polynomials and matrices ( theorem [ matrixpoly ] ) . in the matrix case conjugation action of",
    "the group @xmath12 on matrices appears as in certain sense dual to the action of symmetric group on the space of polynomial roots .",
    "here we are not going into further consideration of the subject , just noting that this duality is produced by two types of degree - changing perturbations of a polynomial .",
    "@xmath13 in order to make above - mentioned apparatus work we introduce category of filtered stratified real algebraic varieties and their semialgebraic subspaces .",
    "that formalism , including ( symmetric ) group actions on those structures is developed in the section 3 .",
    "formalisms of stratified filtered real algebraic varieties and formalism of stability theories and @xmath1-stratifications allows us to describe the topology of @xmath1-strata up to homotopy equivalence , where @xmath1-strata appearing to be described via products of and , in many cases , up to homeomorphism .",
    "one example result , appearing in it s full formulation in theorem [ hott ] and proposition [ compactconnected ] is mentioned below :     +   +     +    let stable region @xmath0 be an open semialgebraic set . then connected component of a @xmath1-stratum is homotopy equivalent to the direct product of skeleta of tori .    here by @xmath14-skeleton of @xmath15-tori @xmath16",

    "section 5 is devoted to the study of the topological properties of @xmath1-strata .",
