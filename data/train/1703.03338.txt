    "the communication paradigm of cooperative relaying has recently received considerable attention due to its effectiveness in alleviating the effects of multipath fading , pathloss and shadowing , and its ability to deliver improved performance in cognitive radio systems and wireless sensor networks .",
    "relay - assisted cellular networks are a promising solution for enhancing coverage and are included in standards , such as ieee 802.16j / m and long term evolution - advanced ( lte - a ) .",
    "several protocols for cooperative relaying were presented in @xcite where the gains in transmit and receive diversity were studied . in multi - relay networks , simultaneous transmissions by the relays are in general difficult to handle ; towards this end , opportunistic relay selection has been suggested in @xcite to improve the resource utilization and to reduce the hardware complexity .",
    "stemming from the relay selection concept , many studies have proposed improved selection techniques ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "traditional hd relaying schemes partition the packet transmission slot into two phases , where the transmission on the source - relay @xmath0 link happens in the first phase , and the transmission on the relay - destination @xmath1 link occurs in the second phase .",
    "however , this relaying scheme limits the maximum achievable multiplexing gain to @xmath2 , which also results in bandwidth loss .    in order to overcome such multiplexing and bandwidth limitations ,",
    "several techniques have been proposed in the literature ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) . among them",
    ", the successive relaying scheme in @xcite incorporates multiple relay nodes and allows concurrent transmissions between source - relay and relay - destination to mimic an ideal full - duplex transmission .",
    "however , this scheme targets scenarios with a long distance between the relays and thus inter - relay interference is not considered .",
    "an extension of this work is discussed in @xcite , where the authors assume that iri is strong ( in co - located or clustered relays ) and can always be decoded at the affected nodes ; this decoded iri is exploited in a superposition coding scheme that significantly improves the diversity - multiplexing trade - off performance of the system .    in earlier studies ,",
    "relays were assumed to lack data buffers and relay selection was mainly based on the @xmath3 criterion and its variations ( see , for example , @xcite ) . here , the relay that receives the source signal is also the one that forwards the signal to the destination . with the adoption of buffer - aided relays ,",
    "this coupling is broken , since different relays could be selected for transmission and reception , thus allowing increased degrees of freedom .",
    "buffering at the relay nodes has been shown to be a promising solution for cooperative networks and motivates the investigation of new protocols and transmission schemes ( see @xcite and @xcite for an overview ) .",
    "@xcite proposed a novel criterion based on @xmath4 relay selection ( mmrs ) , in which the relay with the best source - relay @xmath0 link is selected for reception and the relay with the best relay - destination @xmath1 link is selected for transmission on separate slots . in @xcite , at each slot the best link is selected among _ all _ the available @xmath0 and @xmath1 links , as a part of the proposed @xmath5 policy , thus offering an additional degree of freedom to the network , while buffer - aided link selection was studied in topologies with source - destination connectivity ( see , _",
    "e.g. , _ in @xcite ) , resulting in improved diversity and throughput . more recently , to alleviate the throughput loss of hd relaying , significant focus has been given to minimizing the average packet delay . towards this end ,",
    "various works have proposed hybrid solutions combining the benefits of mmrs and @xmath5 @xcite , the use of broadcasting in the @xmath0 link @xcite , the prioritization of @xmath1 transmissions @xcite or the selection of the relay with the maximum number of packets residing in its buffer @xcite .",
    "however , it was shown that a trade - off exists between delay performance and the diversity of transmission as the number of relays with empty or full buffers increases .    to improve throughput and reduce average packet delays , a number of works proposed to employ non - orthogonal successive transmissions by the source and a selected relay . in order to recover the hd multiplexing loss",
    ", @xcite suggests to combine mmrs with successive transmissions ( sfd - mmrs ) . as the proposed topology aims to mimic full - duplex relaying ,",
    "different relays are selected in the same time slot ; however , relays are assumed to be isolated and the effect of iri is ignored .",
    "more practical topologies were studied in @xcite where iri exists and is not always possible to be cancelled .",
    "for fixed rate transmission , the proposed @xmath6 solution proposed in @xcite , combining power adaptation and interference cancellation , provides a performance close to the upper bound of sfd - mmrs .",
    "in addition , kim and bengtsson  @xcite proposed buffer - aided relay selection and beamforming schemes taking the iri into consideration ; they consider a model which can be regarded as an example of relay - assisted device - to - device ( d2d ) communications , where the source and destination are low - cost devices with a single antenna and the base stations comprise more powerful relays with buffers and multiple antennas .",
    "numerical results show that their approach outperforms sfd - mmrs when interference is taken into consideration , and when the number of relays and antennas increases they approach the performance of the interference - free sfd - mmrs , herein called the _ ideal _ sfd - mmrs .",
    "finally , the use of buffer aided relays has been considered in topologies wth full - duplex ( fd ) capabilities @xcite and decoupled non - orthogonal uplink and downlink transmissions @xcite , showing that throughput can be significantly improved due to the increased scheduling flexibility .    in many practical considerations ( _ e.g. _ , wireless sensors ) ,",
    "the relay nodes are hardware - limited to be hd while the source can be a more powerful wireless device with large buffers and multiple antennas .",
    "although this observation is not always true ( _ e.g. _ , in d2d communications  @xcite ) , it is a reasonable and common practical scenario . towards this end , we study a network which consists of a buffer - aided source with one or multiple antennas , multiple hd buffer - aided relays and a destination . with this setup ,",
    "we are able to approach ( achieve ) the performance of the ideal sfd - mmrs by adopting a buffer - aided source whose buffer retains replicas of the relay buffers , successfully transmitted data from the source to relays , to facilitate iri mitigation ( cancellation ) ;    we relax the assumption of knowing the full csi and instead we allow for csir and limited feedback from the receiver to the transmitter ; under these conditions we propose a relay pair selection scheme that is based on partial phase alignment of signals .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model ] , the system model is outlined .",
    "the proposed relaying schemes for variable and fixed rate are presented in sections  [ sec : policy1 ] and [ sec : policy2 ] , respectively .",
    "the performance of the proposed relaying policies in terms of outage and average throughput , along with comparisons with other state - of - the - art relaying schemes are presented in section  [ sec : numerical ] .",

    "<S> we study a cooperative network with a buffer - aided multi - antenna source , multiple half - duplex ( hd ) buffer - aided relays and a single destination . </S>",
    "<S> such a setup could represent a cellular downlink scenario , in which the source can be a more powerful wireless device with a buffer and multiple antennas , while a set of intermediate less powerful devices are used as relays to reach the destination . </S>",
    "<S> the main target is to recover the multiplexing loss of the network by having the source and a relay to simultaneously transmit their information to another relay and the destination , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> successive transmissions in such a cooperative network , however , cause inter - relay interference ( iri ) . first , by assuming global channel state information ( csi ) , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the detrimental effect of iri can be alleviated by precoding at the source , mitigating or even fully canceling the interference . </S>",
    "<S> a cooperative relaying policy is proposed that employs a joint precoding design and relay - pair selection . </S>",
    "<S> note that both fixed rate and adaptive rate transmissions can be considered . for the case </S>",
    "<S> when channel state information is only available at the receiving side ( csir ) , we propose a relay selection policy that employs a phase alignment technique to reduce the iri . </S>",
    "<S> the performance of the two proposed relay pair selection policies are evaluated and compared with other state - of - the - art relaying schemes in terms of outage and throughput . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that the use of a powerful source can provide considerable performance improvements .    </S>",
