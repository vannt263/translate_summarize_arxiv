    "an important question in percolation theory is : does @xmath1 have an infinite connected component ?    a key problem in answering this question is in defining what is meant by a random arrangement of points .",
    "a standard model is the _ poisson point process _ ,",
    "in which the probability that a ( borel ) set @xmath2 contains @xmath3 points of the random arrangement is poisson distributed with parameter @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is lebesgue measure and @xmath6 is the _ intensity _ of the process .",
    "events in disjoint sets are independent @xcite . here",
    "@xmath6 is the ( average ) density of arrangements of points ; it can be shown that if @xmath6 is greater than some critical value @xmath7 , then @xmath1 has an infinite connected component with probability one @xcite .",
    "( of course @xmath7 depends on the connection distance @xmath0 . )",
    "the poisson point process is closely related to the ( grand canonical ) _ gibbs distribution _ of statistical mechanics ( with particle interaction set to zero and momentum variables integrated out ) in the sense that they give nearly identical probabilistic descriptions of arrangements of points in large finite subsets of the plane .",
    "the gibbs distributions , however , also allow for interactions among the points .",
    "suppose the points interact through a simple exclusion of radius @xmath8 .",
    "( that is , each pair of points is separated by a distance of at least @xmath9 . )",
    "each arrangement of points can then be imagined as a collection of _ hard core _",
    "( i.e. , nonoverlapping ) disks of radius @xmath10 .",
    "there is a gibbs distribution on arrangements of points with exclusion radius @xmath9 in finite subsets of the plane which , like the poisson process , gives equal probabilistic weight to every arrangement of the same density .",
    "furthermore a probability measure can be defined on such arrangements in the whole plane , such that in a certain sense its restriction to finite subsets has the gibbs distribution .",
    "this probability measure , called an ( infinite volume ) _ gibbs measure _ , has been extensively studied ( see e.g. @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "it is natural to ask whether @xmath1 has an infinite connected component when the points in @xmath1 are sampled from a gibbs measure with an exclusion of radius @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath11 , one can argue that the exclusion is insignificant and that , by analogy with the poisson process , there is some critical _ activity _ , @xmath12 , such that @xmath1 almost surely has an infinite connected component for @xmath13 .",
    "( see section 7 of @xcite for a sketch of a proof in this direction . ) here the activity @xmath14 is a parameter analogous to the intensity of the poisson process .    if @xmath10 and @xmath0 are close the qualitative relationship with the poisson point process is less clear , at least as it pertains to percolation . in particular , let @xmath15",
    ". then the percolation question is closely related to _ excluded volume_. ( the excluded volume corresponding to an arrangement of points is the set of all points which , due to the exclusion radius , can not be added to the arrangement . )",
    "if @xmath1 has an infinite component for such @xmath0 , then there is an infinite connected region of excluded volume .",
    "the latter event has been associated with the gas / liquid phase transition in equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite,@xcite .",
    "below it is proved that given @xmath16 , with points distributed under a gibbs measure with an exclusion of radius @xmath9 , @xmath1 has an infinite connected component almost surely whenever the activity @xmath14 is sufficiently large .",
    "little is known about qualitative properties of typical samples from a gibbs measure ( with exclusion ) when @xmath14 is large ; even simulations have been inconclusive , although a recent large - scale study @xcite may settle some questions .",
    "it is expected ( but not proven ) that when @xmath14 is large , typical arrangements exhibit long - range orientational order @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it has been shown that there can be no long - range positional order at any @xmath14 ( see @xcite ; this is an extension of the famous mermin - wagner theorem to the case of hard core interactions ) .",
