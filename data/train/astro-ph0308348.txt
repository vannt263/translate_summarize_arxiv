    "if these galaxies have a larger  than what was previously expected , there is no disagreement : the small number of satellites would be explained by the relatively scarcity by which large subhalos are formed in the cdm model . in this case",
    "every large dm satellite hosts a dwarf galaxy .",
    "the absence of a stellar component in the numerous small dm satellites could be explained by feedback and/or reionization .",

    ", it seems that subhalos resolved with many more particles than subhalos in present - day cosmological simulations will be more concentrated .",
    "however , it is not clear how this effect will affect the conclusion that observed dsph galaxies inhabit the largest subhalos .    in our analysis of the structure of dwarf halos , we also compute the abundance of subhalos .",
    "we measure the amount of substructure in halos a1 ( dwarf halo ) , b1 ( magellanic cloud - sized halo ) and c1 ( group - size halo ) through the normalized subhalo  function (  is measured in units of the virial velocity of the parent halo ) and find a mass - scale independent result : the curves are similar and well approximated by the power - law @xmath152 @xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with the paper by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we compute the dwarf halo mass function and find an excellent agreement with the model of @xcite .",
    "the model has been tested at different redshifts , for a variety of cosmologies , and for halo masses above @xmath153 @xcite .",
    "it provides an excellent match to the data . in this paper , we tested it at much lower masses , @xmath154 , and found also an excellent agreement with the data .",
    "it is pleasant to know that this approximation is able to match data for ten orders of magnitude in mass .",
    "the spin parameter distribution @xmath127 is measured for our sample of dwarf halos ( halos with a virial mass between @xmath4 and @xmath155 ) .",
    "it is well fitted by a lognormal distribution with @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "these parameters roughly agree with those estimated by @xcite .",
    "our results corroborate the known independence of the spin parameter on mass @xcite and epoch @xcite .",
