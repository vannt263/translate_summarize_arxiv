    "the correlations between galaxy and central supermassive black hole properties found in the local universe @xcite have led to notions that the growth of both must be intimately related .",
    "a fraction of the gas fuelling star formation is believed to reach the black hole , which will grow by accretion during an obscured quasar phase @xcite , and is expected to develop winds or jets that eventually become powerful enough to expel the gas , preventing any further star formation .",
    "this feedback process is needed to avoid forming more stars than are seen around local dormant black holes @xcite , but few compelling examples of this phase have been reported to date .",
    "quasars are believed to be viewed as obscured or unobscured depending on the orientation of the line of sight with respect to the axis of symmetry and the dusty `` torus '' surrounding the accretion disk , yet the population of powerful obscured quasars had remained elusive . since most of the growth of supermassive black holes is obscured by dust , optical surveys miss this phase completely , and x - ray surveys miss a significant fraction due to associated gas column . recently ,",
    "mid - infrared surveys have been able to find obscured active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in large numbers , but care must be taken to separate agn from star - forming galaxies .",
    "this can be achieved by making use of the particular mid - infrared colours of agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or using a combination of mid - infrared and radio data ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , from these surveys it seems that a large fraction of obscured agn are undetected in x - rays ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that mid - infrared selected samples give a more complete picture than x - ray selected samples .",
    "some obscured quasars , however , do not show even the narrow emission lines expected if the central regions are obscured at certain angles by a torus ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , some have evidence for dust in front of the narrow - line region @xcite , and radio observations suggest that in some cases the radio jet is closely aligned with the observer s line of sight , observations which are incompatible with the scenario of all obscuration being caused by the torus around the accretion disk .",
    "the existence of objects which are not easily explained in the torus model has led to the suggestion that , in many cases , dust on scales of kpc is responsible for the obscuration . since young stars are born in dusty regions , it is possible that in these sources the host galaxy is undergoing an episode of star formation .",
    "mid - infrared spectroscopy gives a clean method of looking for star formation in the form of emission from complex molecules like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these molecules are excited by ultraviolet photons from young stars , but destroyed by the hard radiation of an agn out to @xmath2 100 pc - 1 kpc scales .",
    "thus , detection of the pah emission bands can only be attributed to star - formation and not to excitation by an agn .    if obscured and unobscured quasars are identical types of objects viewed at a different orientation , then the properties of their host galaxies , such as the pah luminosity , should be identical on average . in a detailed study of local agn ,",
    "found that indeed the pah luminosities of seyfert  1 and seyfert  2 agn are statistically indistinguishable , and that the observed differences between the seyfert  1 and 2 spectra are due to the different contrast between the pahs and the continuum , the latter being weaker for seyfert  2s .    in this letter we present the results of mid - infrared spectroscopy of a sample of radio - intermediate obscured ( type-2 )",

    "only the low resolution , long wavelength detector was used ( long - low ) , with both orders , giving coverage in the spectral range 14 - 38  @xmath4 m . however , due to the high noise above 35  @xmath4 m , we only make use of the range 14 - 35  @xmath4 m . the number of cycles each source was observed for is shown in table  [ tab : main ] .",
    "each cycle involves two nodded positions , with an individual cycle duration of 120  s at each position .",
    "note that three sources were not observed due to their high - redshifts ( ams03 , ams12 and ams16 ) .",
    "the basic calibration data ( bcd ) from the spitzer science center irs pipeline were then combined by subtracting nodded pairs , and median combining the pairs .",
    "the number of nodded pairs combined in this way varies between 2 and 10 , depending on the source ( see table  1 ) .",
    "both mean and median combining were tried , and for most sources the resulting spectra were almost indistinguishable .",
    "mean combining lead to slightly better signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) spectra in the smooth regions , but median combining generally proved better at removing spikes of noise .",
    "given the low snr for most of our spectra , median combining was chosen .",
    "the 2-dimensional spectra were cleaned of rogue pixels using irsclean , and 1-dimensional spectra were extracted using the optimal extraction in spice@xmath10 . for the optimal extraction , an uncertainty file",
    "was first created from the frame to frame variance of each pixel , using the 440 bcd files of our own go program .",
    "this uncertainty file was scaled to the correct exposure time for each source , and is overlayed in figure  1 .",
    "all 18 sources are detected in the reduced data .",
    "the mid - infrared spectra allow us to obtain spectroscopic redshifts for a further 8 sources , confirming that 17 out of 21 sources in our sample lie at @xmath11 .",
    "contamination by pure starbursts is unlikely , since the mid - infrared spectra are characteristic of agn - dominated sources .",
    "figure  1 shows the 18 individual spectra .",
    "silicate absorption can be found in most of the sources . in two cases ( ams05 ,",
    "see appendix  [ sec : opt ] , ams17 ) , the lack of this feature can be explained due to their high redshift , so the feature is expected to be centred at and observed wavelength @xmath12  @xmath4 m . in other sources",
    "the low snr means it is difficult to see clearly this feature , although hints of it are seen in the 2d and 1d spectra .",
    "in addition , from figure  1 , it can be seen that ams01 could be at @xmath13 and have a shallow silicate feature , but we do not consider this redshift secure so we do not quote it in table  1 .",

    "these mid - infrared properties are characteristic of agn . in fact 6",
    "sources showing no rest - frame ultraviolet lines are at redshifts where the ly  @xmath14 falls in the optical range ( that is @xmath15 ) , and therefore have no ly  @xmath14 detection down to @xmath16@xmath17 w m@xmath18 .",
    "we estimate the absorption to the broad - line region , at 1216  to be @xmath19 magnitudes ( see section  [ sec : ext ] ) .",
    "the extinction towards the narrow - line region is expected to be significantly lower .",
    "however , the ly  @xmath14 line suffers from resonant scattering , so modest amounts of dust mixed with the narrow - line region could still severely extinguish the line emission .",
    "indeed , the ly  @xmath14 profile of ams03 ( figure  6 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is very similar to the simulated spectrum of a young dusty galaxy by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure  2 ) , which includes resonant scattering .",
    "ams03 is close to the limit of our sensitivity , so sources where the narrow - line region is dustier or where the ly  @xmath14 line is intrinsically less luminous than in ams03 , will not show ly  @xmath14 in our optical spectra .",
    "we find 10 objects with an excess emission around rest - frame 8  @xmath4 m , which at first suggests the 7.7  @xmath4 m pah emission band .",

    "although it is difficult to estimate the star - formation rates ( sfrs ) from @xmath104 , the values of @xmath104 estimated for obscured quasars are similar to those of smgs ( see figure  5 ) , which have typical sfrs @xmath1051000 m@xmath21 yr@xmath68 ( of all stars , integrated over a salpeter initial mass function ) estimated from their rest - frame fir luminosities .",
    "these values of @xmath104 are , in addition , larger than the limits inferred for lower - redshift x - ray absorbed quasars @xcite , or the values of @xmath104 found in nearby `` pg '' quasars @xcite , which have lower far - infrared luminosities and thus inferred sfrs ( @xmath106 m@xmath21 yr@xmath68 ) than the smgs .",
    "two main conclusions can be extracted from this work .",
    "firstly , we have found that the mid - infrared spectra are continuum dominated , and 12 out of 18 spectra show a deep silicate absorption feature ( with @xmath1@xmath21 - 2 ) .",
    "we have confirmed spectroscopically the existence of sources with mid - infrared spectra characterstic of heavily obscured quasars , but that do not show rest - frame ultraviolet emission lines ( observed in the optical ) .",
    "the number of these sources is similar to the number of obscured quasars that do show ultraviolet narrow emission lines . using the new mid - infrared redshifts",
    ", we confirm that the population of radio - intermediate obscured ( type-2 ) quasars outnumbers the unobscured population ( type-1 ) , and that 63@xmath3% of @xmath0 radio - intermediate quasars are obscured .",
    "this had already been suggested in @xcite , and in this paper we confirm the result spectroscopically : amongst radio - intermediate sources , the population of obscured quasars is responsible for the bulk of the accretion onto supermassive black holes .",
    "secondly , we have found that obscured quasars are sometimes hosted by galaxies undergoing vigorous star formation , with detectable pahs comparable in strength to those found in smgs .",
    "the accompanying sfr is expected to be very large ( @xmath105100 m@xmath21 yr@xmath68 ) , so that it can form a significant fraction of an @xmath107 galaxy in @xmath108 yr .",
    "the dust and gas fuelling this star formation are likely to be responsible for at least part of the obscuration in some of the sources , with the accreting black hole deeply embedded .",
    "these properties are those expected from an obscured phase of black hole growth @xcite , and could explain why in some obscured quasars the rest - frame ultraviolet lines are not detectable .",

    "for ams18 , the redshifts derived from optical and mid - infrared spectroscopy disagree completely ( compare table  [ tab : main ] to table  1 of * ? ? ? * ) , and ams15 had not been observed in optical spectroscopy .",
    "ams03 was found to have an interesting source nearby : in imaging data , the source was point - like in k , but galaxy - like in r , suggesting a reddened quasar . for these reasons the 3 objects",
    "were observed using the isis spectrograph at the william herschel telescope in july 2007 .    in the spectrum of ams18",
    "reported in @xcite , three very weak lines were visible , at 4680 , 5652 and 7527  , yet our new spectrum shows no hint of these three lines .",
    "thus , it is most likely that they were not real and the redshift reported in @xcite is incorrect .",
    "thus , we favour the redshift of @xmath109 from mid - infrared spectroscopy , and this value is quoted in table  1 .",
    "in ams15 we find no evidence for any optical lines , in either the blue or red spectra . for ams03 , the slit was placed at a different position angle ( 31 degrees ) to go through the reddened quasar . in the 1d spectrum of ams03",
    ", we see the same double - peaked emission as reported in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure  6 ) .",
    "the optical spectrum of the candidate reddened quasar looks like that of an elliptical galaxy at @xmath110 , and no obvious emission lines are visible .    in addition , for ams05 , a new optical spectrum and imaging ( using both narrow and broad bands ) suggest the ly  @xmath14 line had been missidentified as c  iv , and the object is actually at @xmath111 rather than @xmath112 ( d. smith , private communication ) .    comparing optical and mid - infrared spectral properties , and radio properties ,",
    "we see that none of the sources with flat radio spectra show narrow lines in their optical spectra ( ams07 , ams15 , ams18 and ams19 , see table  [ tab : main ] ) .",
    "this is important as , from unified schemes , one expects flat - spectrum radio sources to have broad lines ( except in the case of blazars , where the beamed continuum can outshine the broad - line region ) .",
    "thus , if these sources are obscured , the obscuration must occur due to dust on a larger scale ( not due to the torus ) and so the narrow lines , as well as the broad lines , are expected to be obscured .",
    "alternatively , the dust might be on a small scale similar to that of the torus , but with a covering fraction @xmath113 , so that the narrow - line region can not be excited by photons from the central engine ."
