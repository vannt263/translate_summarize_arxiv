    "in a recent paper @xcite we have proposed a model based on a bulk a@xmath0 flavor symmetry @xcite in warped geometry @xcite , in an attempt to describe masses and mixing patterns of standard model ( sm ) quarks and leptons . as in previous models based on a@xmath10 @xcite , the three generations of left - handed quarks transform as triplets of a@xmath0 ; this assignment forbids tree level gauge mediated fcncs and allows to obtain realistic masses and almost realistic mixing angles in the quark sector .",
    "the scalar sector of the rs - a@xmath0 model contains two bulk flavon fields , in addition to a bulk higgs field .",
    "the bulk flavons transform as triplets of a@xmath10 , and allow for a complete  cross - talk \" @xcite between the a@xmath11 spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) pattern associated with the heavy neutrino sector  with scalar mediator peaked towards the uv brane  and the a@xmath12 ssb pattern associated with the quark and charged lepton sectors  with scalar mediator peaked towards the ir brane .",
    "a bulk custodial symmetry , broken differently at the two branes @xcite , guarantees the suppression of large contributions to electroweak precision observables @xcite , such as the peskin - takeuchi @xmath13 , @xmath14 parameters .",
    "however , the mixing between zero modes of the 5d theory and their kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations ",
    "after 4d reduction  may still cause significant new physics ( np ) contributions to sm suppressed flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes .    in the most general case , without imposing any additional flavor symmetry and assuming anarchical 5d yukawa couplings ,",
    "new physics contributions can already be generated at tree level through a kk gauge boson exchange .",
    "even if a rs - gim suppression mechanism @xcite is at work , stringent constraints on the kk scale come from the @xmath15 oscillation parameter @xmath16 and the radiative decays @xmath17 @xcite , the direct cp violation parameter @xmath18 @xcite , and especially the neutron electric dipole moment @xcite , where a kk mass of @xmath19(3 tev ) gives rise to a np contribution which is roughly forty times larger than the current experimental bound  a cp problem in itself , referred to as little cp problem .",
    "the bounds become increasingly stringent by ir localizing the higgs field .",
    "conclusions may differ if a flavor pattern of the yukawa couplings is assumed to hold in the 5d theory due to bulk flavor symmetries .",
    "they typically imply an increased alignment between the 4d fermion mass matrix and the yukawa and gauge couplings , thus suppressing the amount of flavor violation induced by the interactions with kk states .",
    "one example that removes or suppresses all tree level contributions is the generalization to 5d of minimal flavor violation in the quark sector @xcite and in the lepton sector @xcite . in these settings ,",
    "the bulk mass matrices are aligned with the 5d yukawa matrices as a result of a bulk @xmath20^{6}$ ] flavor symmetry that is broken in a controlled manner . in",
    "@xcite a shining mechanism is proposed , where the suppression of flavor violation in the effective 4d theory on the ir brane is obtained by confining the sources of flavor violation to the uv brane , and communicating its effects through gauge bosons of the gauged bulk flavor symmetry .    in our case , the most relevant consequence of imposing an a@xmath0 flavor symmetry is the degeneracy of the left - handed fermion bulk profiles @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath22 .",
    "in addition , the distribution of phases , ckm and majorana - like , in the mixing matrices might induce zeros in the imaginary components of the wilson coefficients contributing to cp violating quantities .",
    "in @xcite we already observed a few consequences of the a@xmath0 flavor symmetry .",
    "first , the new physics contribution to @xmath3 coming from a kk gluon exchange at tree level vanishes @xcite , thus relaxing the most stringent bound on the kk scale induced by @xmath3 in flavor anarchic models @xcite .",
    "this leaves @xmath17 , @xmath23 , the neutron edm and higgs mediated fcncs as possible candidates to produce the most stringent lower bounds on the kk scale .",
    "in addition , a milder lower bound from the edm and @xmath24 should be expected in our model due to the vanishing of down - type dipole contributions in the naive spurion analysis and mass insertion approximation .",
    "it should also be interesting to compare this pattern to the case of larger realizations of the flavor symmetry , like @xmath25 @xcite , usually associated with a rather richer flavon sector .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the above processes , @xmath26 , @xmath23 , the neutron edm and higgs mediated fcnc ( hmfcnc ) processes @xcite , in the context of rs - a@xmath0 . differently from flavor anarchy , it is particularly relevant in this case to properly describe the flavor pattern of yukawa interactions and the mixing among generations . for this reason ,",
    "we predict all quantities at various levels of approximation , starting with the generalization of the spurion analysis in the mass insertion approximation to include bulk effects parameterized by overlap factors .",
    "the latter quantities measure the deviation from the case of a ir localized higgs .",
    "we then proceed beyond the mass insertion approximation , for each generation separately : this means that kk mass eigenstates for each separate generation are obtained by disregarding generational mixing , while the latter is approximately described by the flavor structure of the spurion analysis . finally , we compare with the _ exact _ three - generation case , where all contributions are obtained in terms of the kk mass eigenstates , after the complete mass matrix for the zero modes and kk modes is diagonalized numerically , or by means of an approximate analytical procedure .",

    "[ loyukawa ] , one also has @xmath790 , while eq .",

    "( [ kkblock ] ) .",
    "the @xmath103 terms in the kk diagonalization matrices arise from the rotations that diagonalize the corresponding nearly degenerate subspaces .    to illustrate it , we first focus on the @xmath792 block in eq .",

    "a similar pattern will emerge for the @xmath804 block , where the third column will be the one that approximately vanishes at this order .",
    "considering the @xmath805 block , we recall that @xmath806 , which implies @xmath807 , thus leading to @xmath808 it is already at this level that we notice the modifications induced by @xmath645 , as compared to @xmath644 .",

    "( [ block12])  ( [ block23 ] ) , we realize that the distribution of the 1 , @xmath237 and @xmath818 factors in the off - diagonal blocks of @xmath800 approximately corresponds to the one of the leading order yukawa couplings @xmath819 , up to complex conjugations of terms proportional to @xmath820 . for this reason",
    ", we expect the a@xmath8 @xmath218 rotation matrices defined as @xmath821 to induce some cancellations among the various blocks of @xmath811 .",
    "however , due to the difference of @xmath822 from the rest of the lo yukawa couplings and due to the different rotations in each of the off - diagonal blocks of @xmath800 , it is clear that the cancellations induced by @xmath823 can never be exact , even if we only consider the lo yukawa interactions .",
    "thus , the above diagonalization scheme will still fail to fully diagonalize the degenerate subspace . on the other hand , off - diagonal elements in the non degenerate subspaces like the zero - kk and a few kk - kk entries",
    "can be treated using non degenerate perturbation theory .    at this level ,",
    "the exact structure of the approximate @xmath218 diagonalization matrices composed of the @xmath781 , @xmath823 and the perturbative rotation matrices , used in attempting the analytical diagonalization , is very complicated and impossible to write in a compact way .",

    "( [ ckmassignment ] ) , to provide a realistic ckm matrix in the zma",

    "we then write the magnitude of the off - diagonal elements in the degenerate subspace of @xmath825 to gain an insight into the  contaminations \" , which can not be treated using non degenerate perturbation theory and can only be partly reduced by the @xmath826 rotation matrices .",
    "a similar procedure is followed for @xmath827 and the right - handed rotations .    from eqs .",
    "( [ mkkudspectrum])([mkkbcspectrum ] ) , we learn that the degenerate subspace approximately decomposes in two blocks , one corresponding to the @xmath828 subspace , where all kk masses are approximately @xmath829 and the @xmath830 subspace , the @xmath233 corrections to the kk masses will have a minor effect on this estimation . ] , where all kk masses are approximately @xmath831 . in @xmath832",
    "these masses appear squared , since every diagonal block is proportional to a diagonalized one - generation kk mass matrix squared plus additional @xmath232 terms .",
    "hence in total ,",
    "we have the squared spectrum @xmath833 on the diagonal of the @xmath834 subspace of @xmath835 , and the contaminations in the same subspace amount to @xmath836 we realize that the largest contaminations of @xmath837 are numerically suppressed by three orders of magnitude compared to the diagonal entries for @xmath838 , which corresponds to @xmath839 tev . for",
    "this reason , the results of the approximate analytical diagonalization scheme can still provide an order of magnitude estimate for the physical couplings between zero modes and kk modes . from the above matrix",
    ", one can also infer the way @xmath840 deviates from the  true \" diagonalization matrix ; in particular it is evident that the first row of @xmath840 is the least contaminated .",
    "this qualitatively explains why the semianalytical estimation for the neutron edm is in better agreement with the numerical result than in the case of @xmath206 and @xmath2 .",
    "we have failed to find a better analytical method which would allow us to further diagonalize the contaminated subspace of eq .",
    "( [ mcontaminate ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the adopted scheme allows to qualitatively understand the way some of the cancellation mechanisms still act in the full @xmath218 case .",
